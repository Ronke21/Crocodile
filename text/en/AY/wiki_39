<text>The mineral bastnäsite (or bastnaesite) is one of a family of three fluorocarbonate minerals, which includes bastnäsite-(Ce) with a formula of (Ce, La)CO3F, bastnäsite-(La) with a formula of (La, Ce)CO3F, and bastnäsite-(Y) with a formula of (Y, Ce)CO3F. Some of the bastnäsites contain OH− instead of F− and receive the name of hydroxylbastnasite. Most bastnäsite is bastnäsite-(Ce), and cerium is by far the most common of the rare earths in this class of minerals. Bastnäsite and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium and other rare-earth elements.

Bastnäsite was first described by the Swedish chemist Wilhelm Hisinger in 1838. It is named for the Bastnäs mine near Riddarhyttan, Västmanland, Sweden.
Bastnäsite also occurs as very high-quality specimens at the Zagi Mountains, Pakistan.
Bastnäsite occurs in alkali granite and syenite and in associated pegmatites. It also occurs in carbonatites and in associated fenites and other metasomatites.

==Composition==

Bastnäsite has cerium, lanthanum and yttrium in its generalized formula but officially the mineral is divided into three minerals based on the predominant rare-earth element. There is bastnäsite-(Ce) with a more accurate formula of (Ce, La)CO3F. There is also bastnäsite-(La) with a formula of (La, Ce)CO3F. And finally there is bastnäsite-(Y) with a formula of (Y, Ce)CO3F. There is little difference in the three in terms of physical properties and most bastnäsite is bastnäsite-(Ce). Cerium in most natural bastnäsites usually dominates the others. Bastnäsite and the phosphate mineral monazite are the two largest sources of cerium, an important industrial metal.
Bastnäsite is closely related to the mineral series parisite. The two are both rare-earth fluorocarbonates, but parisite&#x27;s formula of contains calcium (and a small amount of neodymium) and a different ratio of constituent ions. Parisite could be viewed as a formula unit of calcite (CaCO3) added to two formula units of bastnäsite. In fact, the two have been shown to alter back and forth with the addition or loss of CaCO3 in natural environments.

Bastnäsite forms a series with the minerals hydroxylbastnäsite-(Ce) and hydroxylbastnäsite-(Nd). The three are members of a substitution series that involves the possible substitution of fluoride (F−) ions with hydroxyl (OH−) ions.

==Name==

Bastnäsite gets its name from its type locality, the Bastnäs Mine, Riddarhyttan, Västmanland, Sweden. Ore from the Bastnäs Mine led to the discovery of several new minerals and chemical elements by Swedish scientists such as Jöns Jakob Berzelius, Wilhelm Hisinger and Carl Gustav Mosander. Among these are the chemical elements cerium, which was described by Hisinger in 1803, and lanthanum in 1839. Hisinger, who was also the owner of the Bastnäs mine, chose to name one of the new minerals &quot;bastnäsit&quot; when it was first described by him in 1838.

== Occurrence ==
Although a scarce mineral and never in great concentrations, it is one of the more common rare-earth carbonates. Bastnäsite has been found in karst bauxite deposits in Hungary, Greece and the Balkans region. Also found in carbonatites, a rare carbonate igneous intrusive rock, at the Fen Complex, Norway; Bayan Obo, Mongolia; Kangankunde, Malawi; Kizilcaoren, Turkey and the Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California, US. At Mountain Pass, bastnäsite is the leading ore mineral. Some bastnäsite has been found in the unusual granites of the Langesundsfjord area, Norway; Kola Peninsula, Russia; Mont Saint-Hilaire mines, Ontario, and Thor Lake deposits, Northwest Territories, Canada. Hydrothermal sources have also been reported.

The formation of hydroxylbastnasite (NdCO3OH) can also occur via the crystallization of a rare-earth bearing amorphous precursor. With increasing temperature, the habit of NdCO3OH crystals changes progressively to more complex spherulitic or dendritic morphologies. The development of these crystal morphologies has been suggested to be controlled by the level at which supersaturation is reached in the aqueous solution during the breakdown of the amorphous precursor. At higher temperature (e.g., 220 °C) and after rapid heating (e.g. &lt; 1 h) the amorphous precursor breaks down rapidly and the fast supersaturation promotes spherulitic growth. At a lower temperature (e.g., 165 °C) and slow heating (100 min) the supersaturation levels are approached more slowly than required for spherulitic growth, and thus more regular triangular pyramidal shapes form.

==Mining history==
In 1949, the huge carbonatite-hosted bastnäsite deposit was discovered at Mountain Pass, San Bernardino County, California, US. This discovery alerted geologists to the existence of a whole new class of rare earth deposit: the rare earth containing carbonatite. Other examples were soon recognized, particularly in Africa and China. The exploitation of this deposit began in the mid-1960s after it had been purchased by Molycorp (Molybdenum Corporation of America). The lanthanide composition of the ore included 0.1% europium oxide, which was needed by the color television industry, to provide the red phosphor, to maximize picture brightness. The composition of the lanthanides was about 49% cerium, 33% lanthanum, 12% neodymium, and 5% praseodymium, with some samarium and gadolinium, or distinctly more lanthanum and less neodymium and heavies as compared to commercial monazite. The europium content was at least double that of a typical monazite. Mountain Pass bastnäsite was the world&#x27;s major source of lanthanides from the 1960s to the 1980s. Thereafter, China became an increasingly important rare earth supply. Chinese deposits of bastnäsite include several in Sichuan Province, and the massive deposit at Bayan Obo, Inner Mongolia, which had been discovered early in the 20th century, but not exploited until much later. Bayan Obo is currently (2008) providing the majority of the world&#x27;s lanthanides. Bayan Obo bastnäsite occurs in association with monazite (plus enough magnetite to sustain one of the largest steel mills in China), and unlike carbonatite bastnäsites, is relatively closer to monazite lanthanide compositions, with the exception of its generous 0.2% content of europium.

==Ore technology==
At Mountain Pass, bastnäsite ore was finely ground, and subjected to flotation to separate the bulk of the bastnäsite from the accompanying barite, calcite, and dolomite. Marketable products include each of the major intermediates of the ore dressing process: flotation concentrate, acid-washed flotation concentrate, calcined acid washed bastnäsite, and finally a cerium concentrate, which was the insoluble residue left after the calcined bastnäsite had been leached with hydrochloric acid. The lanthanides that dissolved as a result of the acid treatment were subjected to solvent extraction, to capture the europium, and purify the other individual components of the ore. A further product included a lanthanide mix, depleted of much of the cerium, and essentially all of samarium and heavier lanthanides. The calcination of bastnäsite had driven off the carbon dioxide content, leaving an oxide-fluoride, in which the cerium content had become oxidized to the less basic quadrivalent state. However, the high temperature of the calcination gave less-reactive oxide, and the use of hydrochloric acid, which can cause reduction of quadrivalent cerium, led to an incomplete separation of cerium and the trivalent lanthanides. By contrast, in China, processing of bastnäsite, after concentration, starts with heating with sulfuric acid.

===Extraction of rare-earth metals===

Bastnäsite ore is typically used to produce rare-earth metals. The following steps and process flow diagram detail the rare-earth-metal extraction process from the ore.
# After extraction, bastnasite ore is typically used in this process, with an average of 7% REO (rare-earth oxides).
# The ore goes through comminution using rod mills, ball mills, or autogenous mills. 
# Steam is consistently used to condition the ground ore, along with soda ash fluosilicate, and usually Tail Oil C-30. This is done to coat the various types of rare earth metals with either flocculent, collectors, or modifiers for easier separation in the next step. 
# Flotation using the previous chemicals to separate the gangue from the rare-earth metals.
# Concentrate the rare-earth metals and filter out large particles. 
# Remove excess water by heating to ~100 °C. 
# Add HCl to solution to reduce pH to &lt; 5. This enables certain REM (rare-earth metals) to become soluble (Ce is an example). 
# Oxidizing roast further concentrates the solution to approximately 85% REO. This is done at ~100 °C and higher if necessary.
# Enables solution to concentrate further and filters out large particles again.
# Reduction agents (based on area) are used to remove Ce as Ce carbonate or CeO2, typically.
# Solvents are added (solvent type and concentration based on area, availability, and cost) to help separate Eu, Sm, and Gd from La, Nd, and Pr. 
# Reduction agents (based on area) are used to oxidize Eu, Sm, and Gd.
# Eu is precipitated and calcified.
# Gd is precipitated as an oxide.
# Sm is precipitated as an oxide.
# Solvent is recycled into step 11. Additional solvent is added based on concentration and purity.
# La separated from Nd, Pr, and SX.
# Nd and Pr separated. SX goes on for recovery and recycle.
# One way to collect La is adding HNO3, creating La(NO3)3. HNO3 typically added at a very high molarity (1–5 M), depending on La concentration and amount.
# Another method is to add HCl to La, creating LaCl3. HCl is added at 1 M to 5 M depending on La concentration.
# Solvent from La, Nd, and Pr separation is recycled to step 11.
# Nd is precipitated as an oxide product.
# Pr is precipitated as an oxide product.

<text>Maximilian Johannes Maria Hubert Reichsgraf von Spee (22 June 1861 – 8 December 1914) was a naval officer of the German &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; (Imperial Navy), who commanded the East Asia Squadron during World War I. Spee entered the navy in 1878 and served in a variety of roles and locations, including on a colonial gunboat in German West Africa in the 1880s, the East Africa Squadron in the late 1890s, and as commander of several warships in the main German fleet in the early 1900s. During his time in Germany in the late 1880s and early 1890s, he married his wife, Margareta, and had three children, his sons Heinrich and Otto and his daughter Huberta. By 1912, he had returned to the East Asia Squadron as its commander, and was promoted to the rank of &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (Vice Admiral) the following year.

After the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, Spee led his squadron across the Pacific to the coast of South America. Here on 1 November, he defeated the British 4th Cruiser Squadron under Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock in the Battle of Coronel, sinking two of Cradock&#x27;s cruisers and forcing his other two ships to retreat. A month later, Spee decided to attack the British naval base in the Falkland Islands, but a superior British force surprised him. In the ensuing Battle of the Falkland Islands, Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee&#x27;s squadron, which included two powerful battlecruisers, destroyed the East Asia Squadron. Spee and his two sons, who happened to be serving on two of his ships, were all killed, along with about 2,200 other men. Spee was hailed as a hero in Germany, and several ships were named in his honor, including the heavy cruiser , which was built in the 1930s and was scuttled after the Battle of the River Plate during World War II.

==Early career==
Spee was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 22 June 1861, though he was raised in the Rhineland in Germany, where his family had an estate. He joined the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; (Imperial Navy) in 1878 and initially served in the main German naval base at Kiel. He was commissioned an officer at the rank of &quot;Leutnant zur See&quot; (lieutenant at sea), and was assigned to the gunboat , which was sent to western Africa. During this voyage, the Germans signed treaties with local rulers in Togo and Cameroon, creating the colonies of Togoland and Kamerun, respectively. In 1887, Spee was transferred to Kamerun where he commanded the port at Duala. He contracted rheumatic fever while there, and had to be sent back to Germany to recover, though he occasionally suffered from rheumatism for the rest of his life. 

After returning to Germany in 1889, he married his wife, Margareta Baroness von der Osten-Sacken. With her he had two sons—Otto, born on 10 July 1890, Heinrich, born on 24 April 1893—and one daughter, Huberta, born on 11 July 1894. By 1895, Spee had been promoted to the rank of (captain lieutenant). From 1 May to 12 September that year, Spee commanded the ironclad gunboat . In December 1897, Spee was stationed in Germany&#x27;s East Asia Squadron after it seized the Jiaozhou Bay Leased Territory, with its port at Qingdao. Here, he served on the staff of &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; (Vice Admiral) Otto von Diederichs. During the Boxer Uprising in China in 1900, Spee saw action at Qingdao and on the Yangtze.

After arriving back in Germany, he was promoted to the rank of &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; (Corvette Captain) and assigned as the first officer aboard the pre-dreadnought battleship . Between 1900 and 1908, Spee held command of several ships, including the aviso , the minelayer , and finally the pre-dreadnought . During this period, he was promoted to &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; (Frigate Captain) on 27 January 1904 and to &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; (Captain at Sea) exactly a year later; his command of &quot;Wittelsbach&quot; followed the latter promotion. In 1908, he was assigned as the chief of staff to the commander of the North Sea Station, and in 1910 he was promoted to the rank of &quot;Konteradmiral&quot; (&quot;KAdm&quot;–Counter Admiral). Spee was then assigned as the deputy commander for the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet.

==East Asia Squadron==

In late 1912, Spee was given command of the East Asia Squadron, replacing &quot;KAdm&quot; Günther von Krosigk on 4 December. Spee raised his flag on the armored cruiser , and departed on a tour of the southwest Pacific along with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;″s sister ship , during which Spee made visits to several ports, including Singapore and Batavia. Spee was promoted to &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; the following year. Over the following year and a half, Spee met with the leaders of several East Asian countries. From 1 April to 7 May 1913, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; took Spee to Japan to meet the Taishō Emperor. Later in the year, Spee met with Chulalongkorn, the King of Siam. In May 1914, Spee took &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and the torpedo boat on a visit to Port Arthur and then to Tianjin; Spee continued on to Beijing, where he met with Yuan Shikai, the first President of the Republic of China. He came back aboard &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; on 11 May and the ship returned to Qingdao.

Spee thereafter began preparations for a cruise to German New Guinea; &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; departed on 20 June. The two armored cruisers proceeded to Nagasaki, Japan, where they coaled in preparation for their tour. While en route to Truk in the Caroline Islands, they received news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. On 17 July, the East Asia Squadron arrived in Ponape in the Carolines, where the ships remained while tensions steadily rose in Europe. In Ponape, Spee had access to the German radio network, and he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July, followed shortly thereafter by the Russian mobilization—tantamount to a declaration of war—against Austria-Hungary and possibly Germany. On 31 July, word came that the German ultimatum that Russia demobilize its armies was set to expire; Spee ordered his ships&#x27; crews to prepare for war. On 2 August, Wilhelm II ordered German mobilization against Russia and its ally, France. Following Germany&#x27;s violation of neutral Belgium during its invasion of France, Britain declared war on Germany.

===World War I===
The East Asia Squadron consisted of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and the light cruisers , , and . At the time, &quot;Nürnberg&quot; was returning from the west coast of the United States, where &quot;Leipzig&quot; had just replaced her, and &quot;Emden&quot; was still in Qingdao. Spee recalled his ships to consolidate his forces; &quot;Nürnberg&quot; arrived on 6 August and the three cruisers plus their colliers moved to Pagan Island in the Marianas, at that time a German colony. &quot;Emden&quot; and the liner , which had been converted into an auxiliary cruiser, joined the squadron there on 12 August. The four cruisers, accompanied by &quot;Prinz Eitel Friedrich&quot; and several colliers, then departed the central Pacific, bound for Chile. On 13 August, Commodore Karl von Müller, captain of the &quot;Emden&quot;, persuaded Spee to detach his ship as a commerce raider. On 14 August, the East Asia Squadron departed Pagan for Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. While en route across the Pacific, Spee relaxed formalities aboard his ships, integrating the messes for officers and non-commissioned and engineering officers.

To keep the German high command informed, on 8 September Spee detached &quot;Nürnberg&quot; to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. &quot;Nürnberg&quot; returned with news of the Allied capture of German Samoa, which had taken place on 29 August. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; sailed to Apia to investigate the situation. Spee had hoped to catch a British or Australian warship by surprise, but upon his arrival on 14 September, he found no warships in the harbor. Spee decided against attacking the Allied troops ashore, since doing so would risk killing Samoans and damaging German property. On 22 September, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and the rest of the East Asia Squadron arrived at the French colony of Papeete. The Germans attacked the colony, and in the ensuing Battle of Papeete, they sank the French gunboat &quot;Zélée&quot;. The ships came under fire from French shore batteries but were undamaged. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented Spee from seizing the coal in the harbor. Spee then continued across the Pacific, passing through the Marquesas Islands, where his ships acquired supplies including fresh meat by barter, purchase, or confiscation. On 12 October, the squadron reached Easter Island, where it was reinforced by &quot;Leipzig&quot;, , and four more colliers. Spee&#x27;s ships were off the coast of Chile by 1 November, when he learned that the British cruiser was moored in Coronel, ostensibly alone; he decided to try to sink the ship.

====Battle of Coronel====
&quot;Glasgow&quot; was assigned to the 4th Cruiser Squadron, under Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock; as it turned out, &quot;Glasgow&quot; was joined by the armored cruisers and and the auxiliary cruiser . After discovering the entire squadron off Coronel, Spee decided to engage the British ships, but he delayed the action using his ships&#x27; superior speed until later in the day, when the setting sun would silhouette Cradock&#x27;s ships. The German ships would meanwhile be obscured against the Chilean coast, making the task of the British gunners more difficult. At 18:07, Spee issued the order to open fire, with his two armored cruisers battling Cradock&#x27;s armored cruisers and his light cruisers engaging &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot;. Cradock quickly detached &quot;Otranto&quot;, as she had no place in the line of battle. By 18:50, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had disabled &quot;Monmouth&quot; and so shifted fire to &quot;Good Hope&quot;; the combined firepower of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; neutralized &quot;Good Hope&quot; by 19:23. Spee then withdrew his two armored cruisers and sent in his light cruisers to finish off &quot;Monmouth&quot; and &quot;Good Hope&quot;. The British had lost both ships and suffered more than 1,600 dead, including Cradock, though the German ships had expended around 40 percent of their ammunition supply. Spee had inflicted the first defeat on a Royal Navy squadron since the Napoleonic Wars a century earlier.

After the battle, Spee took his ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; in first on the morning of 3 November, leaving &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot; with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee&#x27;s ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to determine the strength of remaining British forces in the region. In addition, Spee sought to counter British press reports that attempted to minimize their losses and exaggerate German casualties. A reception followed at the German Club of Valparaiso, though Spee insisted that the event be restrained in tone. He received a bouquet of flowers to celebrate the victory at Coronel; Spee replied that they would do nicely for his grave. He stated that,

While in port, Spee received the order from the Admiralty Staff to attempt to break through to Germany. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot; took their turn in Valparaiso, after which the re-formed squadron continued south and rounded Cape Horn into the South Atlantic. In the meantime, the Royal Navy sent a pair of battlecruisers— and —commanded by Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee to hunt down Spee&#x27;s squadron and avenge Cradock&#x27;s defeat.

====Battle of the Falkland Islands====
On the morning of 6 December, Spee held a conference with the ship commanders aboard &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; to determine their next course of action. The Germans had received numerous fragmentary and contradictory reports of British reinforcements in the region; Spee and two other captains favored an attack on the Falkland Islands to destroy the British wireless station there, while three other commanders argued that it would be better to bypass the islands and attack British shipping off Argentina. Spee&#x27;s opinion carried the day and the squadron departed for the Falkland Islands at 12:00 on 6 December. The ships arrived off the Falkland Islands two days later; &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; were delegated for the attack. As they approached, observers aboard &quot;Gneisenau&quot; spotted smoke rising from Port Stanley, but assumed it was the British burning their coal stocks to prevent the Germans from seizing them. As they closed on the harbor, shells from the elderly battleship , which had been beached as a guard ship, began to fall around the German ships, which prompted Spee to break off the attack. As Spee withdrew, Sturdee quickly got steam up in his ships and sortied to chase the Germans.

By 13:20, the battlecruisers had caught up with Spee, who realized his armored cruisers could not escape the much faster battlecruisers. He ordered the three light cruisers to attempt to break away while he tried to hold off the British squadron with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Sturdee instead ordered his cruisers to chase down the fleeing German light cruisers while &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Inflexible&quot; dealt with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. Spee deftly maneuvered his ships, taking the leeward position; the wind kept his ships swept of smoke, which improved visibility for his gunners. This forced Sturdee into the windward position and its corresponding worse visibility. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; straddled &quot;Invincible&quot; with her third salvo and quickly scored two hits on the British battlecruiser. The German flagship was herself not hit during this phase of the battle. Sturdee attempted to widen the distance by turning two points to the north to prevent Spee from closing to within the range of his numerous secondary guns. Spee counteracted this maneuver by turning rapidly to the south, which forced Sturdee to turn south as well to keep within range. This allowed &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; to turn back north and get close enough to engage with their secondary 15 cm guns. Their shooting was so accurate that it forced the British to haul away a second time.

The British gunfire became increasingly accurate, and by 16:00, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; had begun to list badly, while fires raged aboard the ship. Spee ordered &quot;Gneisenau&quot; to try to disengage while he turned &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; toward his attackers in an attempt to launch torpedoes at them. At 16:17, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; capsized and sank, taking her entire crew with her, including Spee. The British, still focused on &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, made no effort to rescue survivors. &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, &quot;Leipzig&quot;, and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; were also sunk. Only &quot;Dresden&quot; managed to escape, but she was eventually tracked to the Juan Fernández Islands and sunk. The complete destruction of the squadron killed about 2,200 German sailors and officers, including both of Spee&#x27;s sons; Heinrich died aboard &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, and Otto was killed aboard &quot;Nürnberg&quot;.

==Legacy==
Spee was hailed as a hero in Germany and the men of the East Asia Squadron were celebrated in the press, which emphasized their bravery and refusal to surrender. In September 1917, the second was named &quot;Graf Spee&quot;, and was christened by Spee&#x27;s widow Margarete. Construction of the ship had not been completed by the time of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, and she was broken up for scrap by 1921. In 1934 Germany named the new heavy cruiser after him; as with the earlier vessel, a member of Spee&#x27;s family christened the ship, this time his daughter. In December 1939, &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was scuttled by her crew after the Battle of the River Plate off the coast of Uruguay. Between 1959 and 1964 the Federal German Bundesmarine operated the training frigate &quot;Graf Spee&quot;.

The wreck of Spee&#x27;s flagship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was found off the Falklands on 5 December 2019, almost 105 years to the day after her sinking. Wilhelm Graf von Spee, head of the Graf von Spee family, called the location of the wreck &quot;bittersweet&quot;, remarking that the family took comfort &quot;from the knowledge that the final resting place of so many has been found, and can now be preserved, whilst also being reminded of the huge waste of life. As a family, we lost a father and his two sons on one day. Like the thousands of other families who suffered an unimaginable loss during the First World War, we remember them and must ensure that their sacrifice was not in vain.&quot;

<text>Self-governance, self-government, self-sovereignty, or self-rule is the ability of a person or group to exercise all necessary functions of regulation without intervention from an external authority. It may refer to personal conduct or to any form of institution, such as family units, social groups, affinity groups, legal bodies, industry bodies, religions, and political entities of various degrees. Self-governance is closely related to various philosophical and socio-political concepts such as autonomy, independence, self-control, self-discipline, and sovereignty.

In the context of nation states, self-governance is called national sovereignty which is an important concept in international law. In the context of administrative division, a self-governing territory is called an autonomous region. Self-governance is also associated with political contexts in which a population or demographic becomes independent from colonial rule, absolute government, absolute monarchy, or any government that they perceive does not adequately represent them. It is therefore a fundamental tenet of many democracies, republics and nationalist governments. Mohandas Gandhi&#x27;s term &quot;swaraj&quot; is a branch of this self-rule ideology. Henry David Thoreau was a major proponent of self-rule in lieu of immoral governments.

== Background ==
This principle has been explored in philosophy for centuries, with figures in ancient Greek philosophy such as Plato positing that is necessary for true freedom. Plato believed that individuals or groups cannot achieve freedom unless they govern their own pleasures and desires, and instead will be in a state of enslavement. He states that self-mastery is the ability to be one&#x27;s own master, it means being able to control one&#x27;s own impulses and desires, rather than being controlled by them. Accordingly, this principle is not only a fundamental moral freedom but also as a necessary condition of political freedom and by extension the freedom and autonomy of any political structure.

John Locke further developed this idea, arguing that genuine freedom requires cognitive self-discipline and self-government. He believed that man&#x27;s capacity for self-governance is the source of all freedom. He believed that freedom is not a possession but an action, that is, it is not something that you have but something you do. Locke proposes that rationality is the key to true agency and autonomy, and that political governance is enabled by the governing of one&#x27;s own judgement. His political philosophy was a prominent influence on Immanuel Kant, and was later taken up in part by the Founding Fathers of the United States.

The nature of self-governance, that freedom relies upon self-regulation, has further been explored by contemporary academics Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, William E. Connolly, and others.

Self-governance is not just a philosophical concept but also a practical one. It can be seen in various forms such as self-regulation, self-control, self-management and self-leadership. It is an important concept in the fields of management, leadership, and governance, and is seen as a key to achieving personal and organizational goals. Self-governance can also be seen in the context of community and society, where it refers to the ability of individuals to take responsibility for their own actions and the actions of their community.

Additionally, self-governance is also closely related to the concept of self-determination. Self-determination refers to the idea that individuals and groups have the right to govern themselves, to make decisions about their own lives and to determine their own future and political status without outside interference. This concept is closely linked to the idea of self-governance because it emphasizes the importance of individuals and groups being able to take control of their own lives and to make decisions about their own future. It is also closely linked to the idea of autonomy, which refers to the ability of individuals and groups to make decisions for themselves, without external influence or control.

== Means of self-governance ==

The means of self-governance usually comprises some or all of the following:
* A code of conduct that outlines acceptable behavior within the unit or group. This may include a legal or ethical code (e.g. the Hippocratic Oath of doctors, or established codes of professional ethics).
* A means of ensuring external authority does not become involved unless and until certain criteria are satisfied.
* A means of facilitating the intended functions of the unit or group.
* A means of registering and resolving grievances (e.g. medical malpractice, union procedures, and for achieving closure regarding them).
* A means of disciplinary procedure within the unit or group, ranging from fines and censure up to and including penalty of death.
* A means of suppressing parties, factions, tendencies, or other sub-groups that seek to secede from the unit or group.

<text>A drainage basin is an area of land in which all flowing surface water converges to a single point, such as a river mouth, or flows into another body of water, such as a lake or ocean. A basin is separated from adjacent basins by a perimeter, the &quot;drainage divide&quot;, made up of a succession of elevated features, such as ridges and hills. A basin may consist of smaller basins that merge at river confluences, forming a hierarchical pattern.

Other terms for a drainage basin are catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin, water basin, and impluvium. In North America, they are commonly called a watershed, though in other English-speaking places, &quot;watershed&quot; is used only in its original sense, that of the drainage divide line.

A drainage basin&#x27;s boundaries are determined by watershed delineation, a common task in environmental engineering and science. 

In a closed drainage basin, or endorheic basin, rather than flowing to the ocean, water converges toward the interior of the basin, known as a sink, which may be a permanent lake, a dry lake, or a point where surface water is lost underground.

Drainage basins are similar but not identical to hydrologic units, which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical drainage system. Hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets, outlets, or sinks. In a strict sense, all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins.

== Major drainage basins of the world ==

=== Ocean basins ===
About 48.71% of the world&#x27;s land drains to the Atlantic Ocean. In North America, surface water drains to the Atlantic via the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes basins, the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, the Canadian Maritimes, and most of Newfoundland and Labrador. Nearly all of South America east of the Andes also drains to the Atlantic, as does most of Western and Central Europe and the greatest portion of western Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Western Sahara and part of Morocco. 

The two major mediterranean seas of the world also flow to the Atlantic. The Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico basin includes most of the U.S. interior between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains, a small part of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, eastern Central America, the islands of the Caribbean and the Gulf, and a small part of northern South America. The Mediterranean Sea basin, with the Black Sea, includes much of North Africa, east-central Africa (through the Nile River), Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, Turkey, and the coastal areas of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria.

The Arctic Ocean drains most of Western Canada and Northern Canada east of the Continental Divide, northern Alaska and parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana in the United States, the north shore of the Scandinavian peninsula in Europe, central and northern Russia, and parts of Kazakhstan and Mongolia in Asia, which totals to about 17% of the world&#x27;s land.

Just over 13% of the land in the world drains to the Pacific Ocean. Its basin includes much of China, eastern and southeastern Russia, Japan, the Korean Peninsula, most of Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, all of the Pacific Islands, the northeast coast of Australia, and Canada and the United States west of the Continental Divide (including most of Alaska), as well as western Central America and South America west of the Andes.

The Indian Ocean&#x27;s drainage basin also comprises about 13% of Earth&#x27;s land. It drains the eastern coast of Africa, the coasts of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, the Indian subcontinent, Burma, and most parts of Australia.

=== Largest river basins ===
The five largest river basins (by area), from largest to smallest, are those of the Amazon (7 million km), the Congo (4 million km), the Nile (3.4 million km), the Mississippi (3.22 million km), and the (3.17 million km). The three rivers that drain the most water, from most to least, are the Amazon, Ganges, and Congo rivers.

=== Endorheic drainage basins ===

Endorheic basin are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean. Endorheic basins cover around 18% of the Earth&#x27;s land. Some endorheic basins drain to an Endorheic lake or Inland sea. Many of these lakes are ephemeral or vary dramatically in size depending on climate and inflow. If water evaporates or infiltrates into the ground at its terminus, the area can go by several names, such playa, salt flat, dry lake, or alkali sink. 

The largest endorheic basins are in Central Asia, including the Caspian Sea, the Aral Sea, and numerous smaller lakes. Other endorheic regions include the Great Basin in the United States, much of the Sahara Desert, the drainage basin of the Okavango River (Kalahari Basin), highlands near the African Great Lakes, the interiors of Australia and the Arabian Peninsula, and parts in Mexico and the Andes. Some of these, such as the Great Basin, are not single drainage basins but collections of separate, adjacent closed basins.

In endorheic bodies of water where evaporation is the primary means of water loss, the water is typically more saline than the oceans. An extreme example of this is the Dead Sea.

== Importance ==

=== Geopolitical boundaries ===
Drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries, particularly in regions where trade by water has been important. For example, the English crown gave the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company a monopoly on the fur trade in the entire Hudson Bay basin, an area called Rupert&#x27;s Land. Bioregional political organization today includes agreements of states (e.g., international treaties and, within the US, interstate compacts) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains. Examples of such interstate compacts are the Great Lakes Commission and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.

=== Hydrology ===

In hydrology, the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the hydrological cycle. The process of finding a drainage boundary is referred to as watershed delineation. Finding the area and extent of a drainage basin is an important step in many areas of science and engineering. 

Most of the water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as precipitation falling on the basin. A portion of the water that enters the groundwater system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network. Measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a stream gauge located at the basin&#x27;s outlet. Depending on the conditions of the drainage basin, as rainfall occurs some of it seeps directly into the ground. This water will either remain underground, slowly making its way downhill and eventually reaching the basin, or it will permeate deeper into the soil and consolidate into groundwater aquifers.

As water flows through the basin, it can form tributaries that change the structure of the land. There are three different main types, which are affected by the rocks and ground underneath. Rock that is quick to erode forms patterns, and these are seen most often. The two other types of patterns that form are trellis patterns and rectangular patterns. 

Rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin, and there are different ways to interpret that data. In the unlikely event that the gauges are many and evenly distributed over an area of uniform precipitation, using the arithmetic mean method will give good results. In the Thiessen polygon method, the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon. These polygons are made by drawing lines between gauges, then making perpendicular bisectors of those lines form the polygons. The isohyetal method involves contours of equal precipitation are drawn over the gauges on a map. Calculating the area between these curves and adding up the volume of water is time-consuming.

Isochrone maps can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake, reservoir or outlet, assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall.

=== Geomorphology ===
Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in fluvial geomorphology. A drainage basin is the source for water and sediment that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.

=== Ecology ===

Drainage basins are important in ecology. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and pollutants. With the water, they are transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water body.

Modern use of artificial fertilizers, containing nitrogen (as nitrates), phosphorus, and potassium, has affected the mouths of drainage basins. The minerals are carried by the drainage basin to the mouth, and may accumulate there, disturbing the natural mineral balance. This can cause eutrophication where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material.

=== Resource management ===

Because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydrological sense, it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins. In the U.S. state of Minnesota, governmental entities that perform this function are called &quot;watershed districts&quot;. In New Zealand, they are called catchment boards. Comparable community groups based in Ontario, Canada, are called conservation authorities. In North America, this function is referred to as &quot;watershed management&quot;.
In Brazil, the National Policy of Water Resources, regulated by Act n° 9.433 of 1997, establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of Brazilian water management.

When a river basin crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary, it is identified as a transboundary river. Management of such basins becomes the responsibility of the countries sharing it. Nile Basin Initiative, OMVS for Senegal River, Mekong River Commission are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins.

Management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries.

== Catchment factors ==
The catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of flooding.

Catchment factors are: topography, shape, size, soil type, and land use (paved or roofed areas). Catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for rain to reach the river, while catchment size, soil type, and development determine the amount of water to reach the river.

=== Topography ===
Generally, topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river. Rain that falls in steep mountainous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g., &gt; 1% gradient).

=== Shape ===
Shape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river. A long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment.

=== Size ===
Size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river, as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding. It is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin.

=== Soil type ===
Soil type will help determine how much water reaches the river. The runoff from the drainage area is dependent on the soil type. Certain soil types such as sandy soils are very free-draining, and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground. However, soils containing clay can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes. After prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become , meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground. If the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding; if the ground is permeable, the precipitation will infiltrate the soil.

=== Land use ===
Land use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river, in a similar way to clay soils. For example, rainfall on roofs, pavements, and roads will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the groundwater.
A drainage basin is an area of land where all flowing surface water converges to a single point, such as a river mouth, or flows into another body of water, such as a lake or ocean.

<text>Chytridiomycota are a division of zoosporic organisms in the kingdom Fungi, informally known as chytrids. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;little pot&quot;, describing the structure containing unreleased zoospores. Chytrids are one of the earliest diverging fungal lineages, and their membership in kingdom Fungi is demonstrated with chitin cell walls, a posterior whiplash flagellum, absorptive nutrition, use of glycogen as an energy storage compound, and synthesis of lysine by the -amino adipic acid (AAA) pathway.

Chytrids are saprobic, degrading refractory materials such as chitin and keratin, and sometimes act as parasites. There has been a significant increase in the research of chytrids since the discovery of &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot;, the causal agent of chytridiomycosis.

==Classification==
Species of Chytridiomycota have traditionally been delineated and classified based on development, morphology, substrate, and method of zoospore discharge. However, single spore isolates (or isogenic lines) display a great amount of variation in many of these features; thus, these features cannot be used to reliably classify or identify a species. Currently, taxonomy in Chytridiomycota is based on molecular data, zoospore ultrastructure and some aspects of thallus morphology and development.

In an older and more restricted sense (not used here), the term &quot;chytrids&quot; referred just to those fungi in the class Chytridiomycetes. Here, the term &quot;chytrid&quot; refers to all members of Chytridiomycota.
The chytrids have also been included among the Protoctista, but are now regularly classed as fungi.

In older classifications, chytrids, except the recently established order Spizellomycetales, were placed in the class Phycomycetes under the subphylum Myxomycophyta of the kingdom Fungi. Previously, they were placed in the Mastigomycotina as the class Chytridiomycetes. The other classes of the Mastigomycotina, the Hyphochytriomycetes and oomycetes, were removed from the fungi to be classified as heterokont pseudofungi.

The class Chytridiomycetes has over 750 chytrid species distributed among ten orders. Additional classes include the Monoblepharidomycetes, with two orders, and the Hyaloraphidiomycetes with a single order.

Molecular phylogenetics, and other techniques such as ultrastructure analysis, has greatly increased the understanding of chytrid phylogeny, and led to the formation of several new zoosporic fungal phyla:

* The order Blastocladiales, originally within the Chytridiomycota, are now classified as a separate phylum, the Blastocladiomycota.
* The Neocallimastigales, originally an order of anaerobic fungi of the class Chytridiomycetes, found in the digestive tracts of herbivores, was later raised to a separate phylum, the Neocallimastigomycota.
* The Olpidiaceae, including the type genus &quot;Olpidium&quot;, formerly classified in the order Chytridiales, were raised to a separate phylum, the Olpidiomycota.

==Morphology==
==Life cycle==
Chytridiomycota are unusual among the Fungi in that they reproduce with zoospores. For most members of Chytridiomycota, sexual reproduction is not known. Asexual reproduction occurs through the release of zoospores (presumably) derived through mitosis.

Where it has been described, sexual reproduction of chytrids occurs via a variety of methods. It is generally accepted that the resulting zygote forms a resting spore, which functions as a means of surviving adverse conditions. In some members, sexual reproduction is achieved through the fusion of isogametes (gametes of the same size and shape). This group includes the notable plant pathogens &quot;Synchytrium&quot;. Some algal parasites practice oogamy: A motile male gamete attaches itself to a nonmotile structure containing the female gamete. In another group, two thalli produce tubes that fuse and allow the gametes to meet and fuse. In the last group, rhizoids of compatible strains meet and fuse. Both nuclei migrate out of the zoosporangium and into the conjoined rhizoids where they fuse. The resulting zygote germinates into a resting spore.

Sexual reproduction is common and well known among members of the Monoblepharidomycetes. Typically, these chytrids practice a version of oogamy: The male is motile and the female is stationary. This is the first occurrence of oogamy in kingdom Fungi. Briefly, the monoblephs form oogonia, which give rise to eggs, and antheridia, which give rise to male gametes. Once fertilized, the zygote either becomes an encysted or motile oospore, which ultimately becomes a resting spore that will later germinate and give rise to new zoosporangia.


Upon release from the germinated resting spore, zoospores seek out a suitable substrate for growth using chemotaxis or phototaxis. Some species encyst and germinate directly upon the substrate; others encyst and germinate a short distance away. Once germinated, enzymes released from the zoospore begin to break down the substrate and utilize it produce a new thallus. Thalli are coenocytic and usually form no true mycelium (having rhizoids instead).

Chytrids have several different growth patterns. Some are holocarpic, which means they only produce a zoosporangium and zoospores. Others are eucarpic, meaning they produce other structures, such as rhizoids, in addition to the zoosporangium and zoospores. Some chytrids are monocentric, meaning a single zoospore gives rise to a single zoosporangium. Others are polycentric, meaning one zoospore gives rise to many zoosporangium connected by a rhizomycelium. Rhizoids do not have nuclei while a rhizomycelium can.


Growth continues until a new batch of zoospores are ready for release. Chytrids have a diverse set of release mechanisms that can be grouped into the broad categories of operculate or inoperculate. Operculate discharge involves the complete or incomplete detachment of a lid-like structure, called an operculum, allowing the zoospores out of the sporangium. Inoperculate chytrids release their zoospores through pores, slits, or papillae.

== Habitats ==
Chytrids are aquatic fungi, though those that thrive in the capillary network around soil particles are typically considered terrestrial. The zoospore is primarily a means of thoroughly exploring a small volume of water for a suitable substrate rather than a means of long-range dispersal.

Chytrids have been isolated from a variety of aquatic habitats, including peats, bogs, rivers, ponds, springs, and ditches, and terrestrial habitats, such as acidic soils, alkaline soils, temperate forest soils, rainforest soils, Arctic and Antarctic soils. This has led to the belief that many chytrid species are ubiquitous and cosmopolitan. However, recent taxonomic work has demonstrated that this ubiquitous and cosmopolitan morphospecies hide cryptic diversity at the genetic and ultrastructural levels. It was first thought aquatic chytrids (and other zoosporic fungi) were primarily active in fall, winter, and spring. However, recent molecular inventories of lakes during the summer indicate that chytrids are an active, diverse part of the eukaryotic microbial community.

One of the least expected terrestrial environments the chytrid thrive in are periglacial soils. The population of the Chytridiomycota species are able to be supported even though there is a lack of plant life in these frozen regions due to the large amounts of water in periglacial soil and pollen blowing up from below the timberline.

==Ecological functions==

===&quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot;===
The chytrid &quot;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis&quot; is responsible for chytridiomycosis, a disease of amphibians. Discovered in 1998 in Australia and Panama this disease is known to kill amphibians in large numbers, and has been suggested as a principal cause for the worldwide amphibian decline. Outbreaks of the fungus were found responsible for killing much of the Kihansi Spray Toad population in its native habitat of Tanzania, as well as the extinction of the golden toad in 1989. Chytridiomycosis has also been implicated in the presumed extinction of the Southern Gastric Brooding Frog, last seen in the wild in 1981, and the Northern Gastric Brooding Frog, last recorded in the wild in March 1985. The process leading to frog mortality is thought to be the loss of essential ions through pores made in the epidermal cells by the chytrid during its replication.

Recent research has revealed that elevating salt levels slightly may be able to cure chytridiomycosis in some Australian frog species, although further experimentation is needed.

===Other parasites===
Chytrids mainly infect algae and other eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes. The infection can be so severe as to control primary production within the lake. It has been suggested that parasitic chytrids have a large effect on lake and pond food webs. Chytrids may also infect plant species; in particular, &quot;Synchytrium endobioticum&quot; is an important potato pathogen.

===Saprobes===
Arguably, the most important ecological function chytrids perform is decomposition. These ubiquitous and cosmopolitan organisms are responsible for decomposition of refractory materials, such as pollen, cellulose, chitin, and keratin. 
There are also chytrids that live and grow on pollen by attaching threadlike structures, called rhizoids, onto the pollen grains. This mostly occurs during asexual reproduction because the zoospores that become attached to the pollen continuously reproduce and form new chytrids that will attach to other pollen grains for nutrients. This colonization of pollen happens during the spring time when bodies of water accumulate pollen falling from trees and plants.

==Fossil record==
The earliest fossils of chytrids are from the Scottish Rhynie chert, a Devonian-age lagerstätte with anatomical preservation of plants and fungi. Among the microfossils are chytrids preserved as parasites on rhyniophytes. These fossils closely resemble the modern genus &quot;Allomyces&quot;. Holocarpic chytrid remains were found in cherts from Combres in central France that date back to the late Visean. These remains were found along with eucarpic remains and are ambiguous in nature although they are thought to be of chytrids. Other chytrid-like fossils were found in cherts from the upper Pennsylvanian in the Saint-Etienne Basin in France, dating between 300~350 ma.

==In fictional media==
The novel &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Fallout&quot; (2007) features a species of chytrid that feeds on petroleum and oil-based products. In the story the species is modified using nuclear radiation, to increase the rate at which it feeds on oil. It is then used by Islamic extremists in an attempt to destroy the world&#x27;s oil supplies, thereby taking away the technological advantage of the United States.

<text>Zygomycota, or zygote fungi, is a former division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi. The members are now part of two phyla: the Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota. Approximately 1060 species are known. They are mostly terrestrial in habitat, living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Some are parasites of plants, insects, and small animals, while others form symbiotic relationships with plants. Zygomycete hyphae may be coenocytic, forming septa only where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae. Zygomycota is no longer recognised as it was not believed to be truly monophyletic.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Zygomycota&quot; refers to the zygosporangia characteristically formed by the members of this clade, in which resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction. &quot;Zygos&quot; is Greek for &quot;joining&quot; or &quot;a yoke&quot;, referring to the fusion of two hyphal strands which produces these spores, and &quot;-mycota&quot; is a suffix referring to a division of fungi.

==Spores==

The term &quot;spore&quot; is used to describe a structure related to propagation and dispersal. Zygomycete spores can be formed through both sexual and asexual means. Before germination the spore is in a dormant state. During this period, the metabolic rate is very low and it may last from a few hours to many years. There are two types of dormancy. The exogenous dormancy is controlled by environmental factors such as temperature or nutrient availability. The endogenous or constitutive dormancy depends on characteristics of the spore itself; for example, metabolic features. In this type of dormancy, germination may be prevented even if the environmental conditions favor growth.

===Mitospores===
In zygomycetes, mitospores (sporangiospores) are formed asexually. They are formed in specialized structures, the mitosporangia (sporangia) that contain few to several thousand of spores, depending on the species. Mitosporangia are carried by specialized hyphae, the mitosporangiophores (sporangiophores). These specialized hyphae usually show negative gravitropism and positive phototropism allowing good spore dispersal. The sporangia wall is thin and is easily destroyed by mechanical stimuli (e.g. falling raindrops, passing animals), leading to the dispersal of the ripe mitospores. The walls of these spores contain sporopollenin in some species. Sporopollenin is formed out of β-carotene and is very resistant to biological and chemical degradation. 
Zygomycete spores may also be classified in respect to their persistence:

===Chlamydospores===

Chlamydospores are asexual spores different from sporangiospores. The primary function of chlamydospores is the persistence of the mycelium and they are released when the mycelium degrades. Chlamydospores have no mechanism for dispersal. In zygomycetes the formation of chlamydospores is usually intercalar. However, it may also be terminal. In accordance with their function chlamydospores have a thick cell wall and are pigmented.

==Zygophores==

Zygophores are chemotropic aerial hyphae that are the sex organs of zygomycota, except for Phycomyces in which they are not aerial but found in the substratum. They have two different mating types (+) and (-). The opposite mating types grow towards each other due to volatile pheromones given off by the opposite strand, mainly trisporic acid and its precursors. Once two opposite mating types have made initial contact, they give rise to a zygospore through multiple steps.

Once contact between the zygophores has been made, their walls adhere to each other, flatten and then the contact site is referred to as the fusion septum. The tips of the zygophore become distended and form what is called the progametangia. A septum develops by gradual inward extension until it separates the terminal gametangia from the progametangial base. At this point the zygophore is then called the suspensor. Vesicles accumulate at the fusion septum at which time it begins to dissolve. A little before the fusion septum completely dissolves, the primary outer wall begins to thicken. This can be seen as dark patches on the primary wall as the fusion septum dissolves. These dark patches on the wall will eventually develop into warty structures that make up the thickness of the zygospore wall. As the zygospore enlarges, so do the warty structures until there are contiguous around the entire cell. At this point, electron microscopy can no longer penetrate the wall. Eventually the warts push through the primary wall and darken which is likely caused by melanin.

Meiosis usually occurs before zygospore germination and there are a few main types of distinguishable nuclear behavior. Type 1 is when the nuclei fuse quickly, within a few days, resulting in mature zygospore having haploid nuclei. Type 2 is when some nuclei do not pair and degenerate instead, meiosis is delayed until germination. Type 3 is when haploid nuclei continue to divide mitotically and then some associate into groups and some do not. This results in diploid and haploid nuclei being found in the germ sporangium.

==Cell wall==

Zygomycetes exhibit a special structure of cell wall. Most fungi have chitin as structural polysaccharide, while zygomycetes synthesize chitosan, the deacetylated homopolymer of chitin. Chitin is built of β-1,4 bonded &quot;N&quot;-acetyl glucosamine. Fungal hyphae grow at the tip. Therefore, specialized vesicles, the chitosomes, bring precursors of chitin and its synthesizing enzyme, chitin synthetase, to the outside of the membrane by exocytosis. The enzyme on the membrane catalyzes glycosidic bond formations from the nucleotide sugar substrate, uridine diphospho-&quot;N&quot;-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The nascent polysaccharide chain is then cleaved by the enzyme chitin deacetylase. The enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the &quot;N&quot;-acetamido group in chitin. After this the chitosan polymer chain forms micro fibrils. These fibers are embedded in an amorphous matrix consisting of proteins, glucans (which putatively cross-link the chitosan fibers), mannoproteins, lipids and other compounds.

==Trisporic acid==

Trisporic acid is a C-18 terpenoid compound that is synthesized via β-carotene and retinol pathways in the zygomycetes. It is a pheromone compound responsible for sexual differentiation in those fungal species.

===History===
Trisporic acid was discovered in 1964 as a metabolite that caused enhanced carotene production in &quot;Blakeslea trispora&quot;. It was later shown to be the hormone that brought about zygophore production in &quot;Mucor mucedo&quot;. The American mycologist and geneticist Albert Francis Blakeslee discovered that some species of Mucorales were self-sterile (heterothallic), in which interactions of two strains, designated (+) and (-), are necessary for the initiation of sexual activity. This interaction was found by Hans Burgeff of the University of Goettingen to be due to the exchange of low molecular weight substances that diffused through the substratum and atmosphere. This work constituted the first demonstration of sex hormone activity in any fungus. The elucidation of the hormonal control of sexual interaction in the Mucorales extends over 60 years and involved mycologists and biochemists from Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA.

===Functions of trisporic acid in Mucorales===
Recognition of compatible sexual partners in zygomycota is based on a cooperative biosynthesis pathway of trisporic acid. Early trisporoid derivatives and trisporic acid induce swelling of two potential hyphae, hence called zygophores, and a chemical gradient of these inducer molecules results in a growth towards each other. These progametangia come in contact with each other and build a strong connection. In the next stage, septae are established to limit the developing zygospore from the vegetative mycelium and in this way the zygophores become suspensor hyphae and gametangia are formed. After dissolving of the fusion wall, cytoplasm and a high number of nuclei from both gametangia are mixed. A selectional process (unstudied) results in a reduction of nuclei and meiosis takes place (also unstudied until today). Several cell wall modifications, as well as incorporation of sporopollenin (responsible for the dark colour of spores) take place resulting in a mature zygospore.

Trisporic acid, as the endpoint of this recognition pathway, can solely be produced in presence of both compatible partners, which enzymatically produce trisporoid precursors to be further utilized by the potential sexual partner. Species specificity of these reactions is among others obtained by spatial segregation, physicochemical features of derivatives (volatility and light sensitivity), chemical modifications of trisporoids and transcriptional/posttranscriptional regulation.

===Parasexualism===
Trisporoids are also used in the mediation of the recognition between parasite and host. An example is the host-parasite interaction of a parasexual nature observed between &quot;Parasitella parasitica&quot;, a facultative mycoparasite of zygomycetes, and &quot;Absidia glauca&quot;. This interaction is an example for biotrophic fusion parasitism, because genetic information is transferred into the host. Many morphological similarities in comparison to zygospore formation are seen, but the mature spore is called a sikyospore and is parasitic. During this process, gall-like structures are produced by the host &quot;Absidia glauca&quot;.
This, coupled with further evidence, has led to the assumption that trisporoids are not strictly species-specific, but that they might represent the general principle of mating recognition in Mucorales.

==Phototropism==
Light regulation has been investigated in the zygomycetes &quot;Phycomyces blakesleeanus&quot;, &quot;Mucor circinelloides&quot; and &quot;Pilobolus crystallinus&quot;. For example, in &quot;Pilobolus crystallinus&quot; light is responsible for the dispersal mechanism and the sporangiophores of &quot;Phycomyces blakesleeanus&quot; grow towards light. When light, particularly blue light, is involved in the regulation of fungal development, it directs the growth of fungal structures and activates metabolic pathways. For instance, the zygomycota use light as signal to promote vegetative reproduction and growth of aerial hyphae to facilitate spore dispersal.

Fungal phototropism has been investigated in detail using the fruiting body, sporangiophore, of &quot;Phycomyces&quot; as a model. &quot;Phycomyces&quot; has a complex photoreceptor system. It is able to react to different light intensities and different wavelengths. In contrast to the positive reaction to blue light, there is also a negative reaction to UV light. Reactions to red light were also observed.

===Activation of beta-carotene biosynthesis by light===
The two genes for the enzymes phytoene desaturase (carB) and the bifunctional phytoene
synthase/carotene cyclase (carRA in &quot;Phycomyces&quot;, carRP in &quot;Mucor&quot;) are responsible for synthesis of beta-carotene. The product of the gene crgA, which was found in Mucor suppresses the carotene formation by inhibiting the accumulation of carB and carRP mRNAs.

===Influence of light in sporulation and sexual development===
The zygomycete &quot;P. blakesleeanus&quot; builds two types of sporangiophores, the macrophores and the microphores which differ in size. The formation of these sporangiophores work at different light fluences and therefore with specific photoreceptors. Light also regulates asexual sporulation. In &quot;Mucor&quot; the product of the crgA gene acts as an activator. In contrast, the sexual development of Phycomyces is inhibited by light because of a specialized photoreceptor system.

==Gravitropism==
Gravitropism is a turning or growth movement by a plant or fungus in response to gravity. It is equally widespread in both kingdoms. Statolites are required in both fungi and plants for the mechanism of gravity-sensing. The Zygomycota sporangiophores originate from specialized “basal hyphae” and pass through several distinctive developmental stages until the mature asexual spores are released. In addition to the positive phototropism, the sporangiophores are directed by a negative gravitropic response into a position suitable for spore dispersal and distribution. Both responses are growth reactions i.e. the bending is caused by differential growth on the respective opposite flanks of the sporangiophore, and influence each other. The only model for the mechanism of the gravitropic reaction of &quot;Phycomyces&quot; is based on the floatability of the vacuole within the surrounding cytoplasm. The resulting asymmetric distribution of the cytoplasm is proposed to generate increased wall growth on the lower side of horizonally placed sporangiophores as in the thicker cytoplasmic layer forming there the number of vesicles secreting cell-wall material would be higher than on the upper side. Gravitropic bending starts after approximately 15 – 30 min in horizontally placed sporangiophores and continues until after, approximately 12 – 14 hours, the sporangiophore tip has recovered its original vertical position. Usually, the gravitropic response is weaker compared to the phototrophic one. However, in certain conditions, equilibrium could be established and the responses are comparable. In plants and fungi, phototropism and gravitropism interact in a complex manner. During continuous irradiation with unilateral light, the sporangiophore (fruiting body) of the zygomycete fungus, Phycomyces blakesleeanus reach a bending angle of photogravitropic equilibrium at which the gravitropic and phototropic stimuli balance each other (Fig. 1, bending angle +α, due to light irradiation).

===Protein crystals involved in graviperception===
In &quot;Phycomyces blakesleeanus&quot;, wild type sporangiophores contain large, easily seen octahedral paracrystalline crystals with size up to 5×5×5 μm. Generally, they are found near the main vacuole in clusters consisting of more than ten crystals. They are often associated to the vacuolar transepts. Sedimentation with speed of about 100 μm/s can be observed when the sporangiophores are tilted. Sliding along during sedimentation or pulling at the vacuolar membranes and transepts serves as an inter-cellular signal to a probable cytoskeleton response, and that activates receptors located in the cell membrane. These receptors in turn trigger a chain of events which finally leads to the asymmetrical growth of the cell wall. Studies of the bending angle of wild type and mutant strain sporangiophore growth have shown that mutant strains that do not have crystals exhibit reduced gravitropic response.

===Lipid droplets involved in graviperception===
Complex of apical lipid globules are also involved in graviperception. These lipids are clustered in cellular structures, complex of lipid globules, about 0.1mm below the very tip of the apex. (Fig. 2) The globules migrate to the columella when the sporangium is formed. In mature stage this complex is believed to act as a gravireceptor due to its floatability. Mutants that lack this lipid complex show greatly lowered gravitropic response.

==Phylogeny==
Historically, all fungi producing a zygospore were considered to be related and placed into Zygomycota. The use of molecular phylogenetics has increasingly revealed this grouping to be paraphyletic. However, the rank (i.e., phylum or subphylum) these clades is in dispute. What follows is a phylogeny of fungi with the zygomycete subphyla derived from Spatafora et al. (2016) with both possible phylum names.

==Industrial uses==
Many species of zygomycetes can be used in important industrial processes. A resume of them is presented in the table.
===Culture conditions===

The zygomycetes are able to grow in a wide range of environments. Most of them are mesophilic (growing at 10–40 °C with an optimum 20–35 °C), but some, like &quot;Mucor miehei&quot; or &quot;Mucor pusillus&quot;, are thermophilic with a minimum growth temperature of about 20 °C and maximum extending up to 60 °C. Others like &quot;Mucor hiemalis&quot; can grow at temperatures below 0 °C.

Some species of the order Mucorales are able to grow under anaerobic conditions, while most of them require aerobic conditions. Furthermore, while the majority of the zygomycetes only grow at high water activities, some of them are able to grow in salt concentrations of at least 15%. Most species of &quot;Mucor&quot; grow rapidly on agar at room temperature filling the Petri dish in 2–3 days with their coarse aerial mycelium. When incubated in liquid culture under semi-anaerobic conditions, several species grow in yeast like state. Zygospore formation may be stimulated at higher temperatures of incubation (30–40 °C). 

Growth of Zygomycota in solid agar can produce low or very high fibrous colony that rapidly fills the entire Petri dish. Its color may range from pure white to shades of gray or brown. In old cultures, dark pigmented sporangia are observed. Everything depends on the species and the media used. In liquid culture, Zygomycota usually form a bland mass and do not produce spores. This is because they cannot grow aerial hyphae.

===Culture media===
Zygomycetes grow well on most standard fungal culture medium such as Sabouraud dextrose agar. They can also grow on both selective and non-selective media. Minimal media, supplementary media and induction media can also be used. Most zygomycetes are sensitive to cycloheximide (actidione) and this agent should not be used in culture media.

==Reproduction==
A common example of a zygomycete is black bread mold (&quot;Rhizopus stolonifer&quot;), a member of the Mucorales. It spreads over the surface of bread and other food sources, sending hyphae inward to absorb nutrients. In its asexual phase it develops bulbous black sporangia at the tips of upright hyphae, each containing hundreds of haploid spores.

As in most zygomycetes, asexual reproduction is the most common form of reproduction. Sexual reproduction in &quot;Rhizopus stolonifer&quot;, as in other zygomycetes, occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other. Growth of the gametangia commences after gametangia come in contact, and plasmogamy, or the fusion of the cytoplasm, occurs. Karyogamy, which is the fusion of the nuclei, follows closely after. The zygosporangia are then diploid. Zygosporangia are typically thick-walled, highly resilient to environmental hardships, and metabolically inert. When conditions improve, however, they germinate to produce a sporangium or vegetative hyphae. Meiosis occurs during germination of the zygosporangium so the resulting spores or hyphae are haploid. Grows in warm and damp conditions.

Some zygomycetes disperse their spores in a more precise manner than simply allowing them to drift aimlessly on air currents. &quot;Pilobolus&quot;, a fungus which grows on animal dung, bends its sporangiophores towards light with the help of a light sensitive pigment (beta-carotene) and then &quot;fires&quot; them with an explosive squirt of high-pressure cytoplasm. Sporangia can be launched as far as 2 m, placing them far away from the dung and hopefully on vegetation which will be eaten by an herbivore, eventually to be deposited with dung elsewhere. Different mechanisms for forcible spore discharge have evolved among members of the zygomycete order Entomophthorales.

==Evolution of conidia==
The evolution of the conidium from the sporangiospore is the main defining difference between zygomycetes and ascomycetes. The evolution of sporangiospores typical of zygomycetes to conidia similar to those found in ascomycetes can be modeled by a series of forms seen in zygomycetes. Many zygomycetes produce multiple sporangiospores inside a single sporangium. Some have evolved multiple small sporangiola that contain few sporangiospores. In some cases, there may be a few as three spores in each sporangiolum, and a few species have sporangiola which contain just a single spore. &quot;Choanephora&quot;, a zygomycete, has a sporangiolum that contains one spore with a sporangium wall that is visible at the base of the sporangium. This structure is similar to a conidium, which has two, fused cell walls, an inner spore wall and an outer sporangium wall.

<text>The Battle of Coronel was a First World War naval battle that led to an Imperial German Navy victory over the Royal Navy on 1 November 1914, off the coast of central Chile near the city of Coronel. The East Asia Squadron (&quot;Ostasiengeschwader&quot; or &quot;Kreuzergeschwader&quot;) of the Imperial German Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;) led by Vice-Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee met and overpowered a British squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock.

The engagement probably took place as a result of misunderstandings. Neither admiral expected to meet the other in full force. Once the two met, Cradock understood his orders were to fight to the end, despite the odds being heavily against him. Although Spee had an easy victory, destroying two enemy armoured cruisers for just three men injured, the engagement also cost him almost half his supply of ammunition, which was irreplaceable.

Shock at the British losses led the Admiralty to send more ships, including two modern battlecruisers, which in turn destroyed Spee and the majority of his squadron on 8 December at the Battle of the Falkland Islands.

==Background==
At the outbreak of war the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy, with assistance from New Zealand and Japanese naval and land forces in the Far East, had captured the German colonies of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, Yap, Nauru, and Samoa, instead of searching for the German East Asia Squadron commanded by Vice-Admiral Maximilian von Spee, which had abandoned its base at the German concession at Tsingtao in the expectation of war breaking out with Japan. The East Asia Squadron rendezvoused at Pagan Island in the Marianas in early August 1914. Eventually, recognising the German squadron&#x27;s potential for disrupting trade in the Pacific, the British Admiralty decided to destroy it and searched the western Pacific Ocean after the East Asia Squadron had conducted the Bombardment of Papeete (22 September 1914), where a French steamer reported its presence.
On 4 October 1914, the British learned from an intercepted radio message that Spee planned to attack shipping on the trade routes along the west coast of South America. Having correctly guessed the intention of the German commander, Rear-Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock patrolled the area with a squadron consisting of the armoured cruisers (flagship) and , the modern light cruiser , and the armed merchantman . The Admiralty had planned to reinforce the squadron by sending the newer and more powerful armoured cruiser from the Mediterranean, but temporarily diverted this ship to patrol the western Atlantic. &quot;Defence&quot; reached Montevideo two days after the battle, and Cradock instead received the pre-dreadnought battleship .

The change of plan meant that the British squadron comprised obsolete or lightly armed vessels, crewed in the case of &quot;Good Hope&quot; by inexperienced naval reservists. &quot;Monmouth&quot; and &quot;Good Hope&quot; had a large number of 6-inch guns but only &quot;Good Hope&quot; was armed with two 9.2-inch guns mounted in single turrets. Spee had a superior force of five modern vessels (the armoured cruisers and and the light cruisers , and ), led by officers hand-picked by Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; carried eight 8.2-inch guns each, which gave them an overwhelming advantage in range and firepower; the crews of both ships had earned accolades for their gunnery before the war. The Admiralty ordered Cradock to &quot;be prepared to meet them in company&quot;, with no effort being made to clarify what action he was expected to take should he find Spee. On receiving his orders, Cradock asked the Admiralty for permission to split his fleet into two forces, each able to face Spee independently. The two groups would operate on the east and west coasts of South America to counter the possibility of Spee slipping past Cradock into the Atlantic Ocean. The Admiralty agreed and established the east coast squadron under Rear-Admiral Archibald Stoddart, consisting of three cruisers and two armed merchantmen.

The remaining vessels formed the west coast squadron, which was reinforced by &quot;Canopus&quot; on 18 October. At the outbreak of war and said to be in need of overhaul, &quot;Canopus&quot; had a top speed of . (After the fleet sailed, it was found that the ship could only make and that the senior engineer was mentally ill.) The Admiralty agreed that with &quot;Canopus&quot; the fleet would be too slow to force an engagement with the German cruisers and that without &quot;Canopus&quot; the west coast squadron stood no chance. Cradock sailed from the Falklands on 20 October, still under the impression that &quot;Defence&quot; would soon arrive and with Admiralty orders to attack German merchant ships and to seek out the East Asiatic Squadron. As the British squadron rounded Cape Horn, wireless transmissions from &quot;Leipzig&quot; increased in power and it seemed that the British would catch the ship while isolated, but Spee had made rendezvous with &quot;Leipzig&quot; on 14 October and had enforced wireless silence on the other ships.

===Lines of communication===
On 30 October, before the battle but due to communications delays too late to have any effect, Admiral Jackie Fisher was re-appointed First Sea Lord, replacing Prince Louis of Battenberg, who, along with Churchill, had been
preoccupied with fighting to keep his position as First Sea Lord in the face of widespread concern over the senior British Admiral being of German descent. Battenberg was a proven and reliable admiral but was replaced to appease public opinion. The crisis drew the attention of the most senior members of the Admiralty away from the events in South America: Churchill later claimed that if he had not been distracted, he would have questioned the intentions of his admiral at sea more deeply.

A signal from Cradock was received by Churchill on 27 October, advising the Admiralty of his intention to leave &quot;Canopus&quot; behind because of her slow speed and, as previously instructed, to take his remaining ships in search of Spee. He re-stated that he was still expecting reinforcements in the form of &quot;Defence&quot;, which he had previously been told was coming and that he had given orders for her to follow him as soon as possible. Although &quot;Defence&quot; had once been sent to reinforce Cradock, it had then been recalled part way, returned to the Mediterranean and then been sent again to form part of a new squadron patrolling the eastern coast of South America. A misunderstanding had arisen between Cradock and the Admiralty over how ships were to be assigned and used. Cradock believed he was expected to advance against Spee with those forces he had, whereas the Admiralty expected him to exercise caution, using &quot;Canopus&quot; for defence and merely to scout for the enemy or take advantage of any situation where he might come across part of the enemy force. Churchill replied to the signal, telling Cradock that &quot;Defence&quot; was to remain on the east coast and that Cradock was considered to have sufficient forces for his task, making no comment about his plan to abandon &quot;Canopus&quot;. Churchill had passed on the message to the Admiralty staff, saying he did not properly understand what Cradock intended.

Cradock probably received Churchill&#x27;s reply on 1 November with the messages collected by &quot;Glasgow&quot; at Coronel, giving him time to read it before the battle. Thus, Cradock would have taken the message as final confirmation that he was doing what was expected. Departing from Stanley he had left behind a letter to be forwarded to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux in the event of his death. In this, he commented that he did not intend to suffer the fate of Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge, a friend of Cradock, who at the time was awaiting court-martial for failing to engage the enemy. The governor of the Falklands reported that Cradock had not expected to survive, as did the governor&#x27;s aide. Luce reported that &quot;Cradock was constitutionally incapable of refusing or even postponing action if there was the smallest chance of success&quot;.

On 3 November, Fisher in London received news from Valparaíso that Spee had been sighted. He urgently gave orders for &quot;Defence&quot; to join Cradock and stressed the need to keep &quot;Canopus&quot; together with the other ships. On 4 November, German reports of the battle started to reach London.

==Prelude==
===British preparations===

On 22 October, Cradock cabled the Admiralty that he was going to round Cape Horn and was leaving &quot;Canopus&quot; behind to escort his colliers. Admiral John Fisher replaced Battenberg as First Sea Lord on 27 October, and the following day Fisher ordered Cradock not to engage Spee without &quot;Canopus&quot;. He then ordered HMS &quot;Defence&quot; to reinforce Cradock. The previous week Cradock had sent &quot;Glasgow&quot; to Coronel to pick up any messages the Admiralty might have sent. Spee, having learned of the presence of &quot;Glasgow&quot; off Coronel, sailed south from Valparaíso with all five warships with the intention of destroying her. &quot;Glasgow&quot; intercepted radio traffic from one of the German cruisers and informed Cradock, who turned his fleet north to intercept the cruiser.

Given the German superiority in speed, firepower, efficiency and numbers, why Cradock chose to engage puzzles historians. At the time Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge, a friend of Cradock, was awaiting court-martial for failing to engage the enemy, and he had been told by the Admiralty that his force was &quot;sufficient&quot;. The accepted view among Cradock&#x27;s colleagues was that he was &quot;constitutionally incapable of refusing action&quot;. On 31 October, he ordered his squadron to adopt an attacking formation. Both sides are thought to have expected to encounter a single ship until they sighted each other at 16:40 on 1 November.

==Battle==

On 31 October, &quot;Glasgow&quot; entered Coronel harbour to collect messages and news from the British consul. Also in harbour was a supply ship—&quot;Göttingen&quot;—working for Spee, which immediately radioed with the news of the British ship entering harbour. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was listening to radio traffic, which suggested that German warships were close. Matters were confused because the German ships had been instructed to all use the same call sign, that of &quot;Leipzig&quot;. Spee decided to move his ships to Coronel to trap &quot;Glasgow&quot; while Admiral Cradock hurried north to catch &quot;Leipzig&quot;. Neither side realised the other&#x27;s main force was nearby.

At 09:15 on 1 November, &quot;Glasgow&quot; left port to meet Cradock at noon, west of Coronel. Seas were rough so that it was impossible to send a boat between the ships to deliver the messages, which had to be transferred on a line floated in the sea. At 13:05, the ships formed into a line abreast formation apart, with &quot;Glasgow&quot; at the eastern end, and started to steam north at searching for &quot;Leipzig&quot;. At 16:17 &quot;Leipzig&quot;, accompanied by the other German ships, spotted smoke from the line of British ships. Spee ordered full speed so that &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Leipzig&quot; were approaching the British at , with the slower light cruisers &quot;Dresden&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; some way behind.

At 16:20, &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot; saw smoke to the north and then three ships at a range of . The British reversed direction, so that both fleets were moving south, and a chase began which lasted 90 minutes. Cradock was faced with a choice; he could either take his three cruisers capable of , abandon &quot;Otranto&quot; and run from the Germans, or stay and fight with &quot;Otranto&quot;, which could only manage . The German ships slowed at a range of to reorganise themselves for best positions, and to await best visibility, when the British to their west would be outlined against the setting sun.
At 17:10, Cradock decided he must fight, and drew his ships closer together. He changed course to south-east and attempted to close upon the German ships while the sun remained high. Spee declined to engage and turned his faster ships away, maintaining the distance between the forces which sailed roughly parallel at a distance of . At 18:18, Cradock again attempted to close, steering directly towards the enemy, which once again turned away to a greater range of . At 18:50, the sun set; Spee closed to and commenced firing.

The German ships had sixteen guns of comparable range to the two guns on &quot;Good Hope&quot;. One of these was hit within five minutes of the engagement&#x27;s starting. Of the remaining guns on the British ships, most were in casemates along the sides of the ships, which continually flooded if the gun doors were opened to fire in heavy seas. The merchant cruiser &quot;Otranto&quot;—having only eight guns and being a much larger target than the other ships—retired west at full speed.

Since the British guns had insufficient range to match the German guns, Cradock attempted to close on the German ships. By 19:30, he had reached but as he closed, the German fire became correspondingly more accurate. &quot;Good Hope&quot; and &quot;Monmouth&quot; caught fire, presenting easy targets to the German gunners now that darkness had fallen, whereas the German ships had disappeared into the dark. &quot;Monmouth&quot; was first to be silenced. &quot;Good Hope&quot; continued firing, continuing to close on the German ships and receiving more and more fire. By 19:50, she had also ceased firing; subsequently her forward section exploded, then she broke apart and sank, with no one witness to the sinking.

&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; switched her fire to &quot;Monmouth&quot;, while &quot;Gneisenau&quot; joined &quot;Leipzig&quot; and &quot;Dresden&quot; which had been engaging &quot;Glasgow&quot;. The German light cruisers had only guns, which had left &quot;Glasgow&quot; almost unscathed, but these were now joined by the guns of &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. John Luce, captain of &quot;Glasgow&quot;, determined that nothing would be gained by staying and attempting to fight. It was noticed that each time he fired, the flash of his guns was used by the Germans to aim a new salvo, so he also ceased firing. One compartment of the ship was flooded but she could still manage . He returned first to &quot;Monmouth&quot;, which was now dark but still afloat. Nothing was to be done for the ship, which was sinking slowly but would attempt to beach on the Chilean coast. &quot;Glasgow&quot; turned south and departed.
There was some confusion amongst the German ships as to the fate of the two armoured cruisers, which had disappeared into the dark once they ceased firing, and a hunt began. &quot;Leipzig&quot; saw something burning, but on approaching found only wreckage. &quot;Nürnberg&quot;—slower than the other German ships—arrived late at the battle and sighted &quot;Monmouth&quot;, listing and badly damaged but still moving. After pointedly directing her searchlights at the ship&#x27;s ensign, an invitation to surrender—which was declined—she opened fire, finally sinking the ship. Without firm information, Spee decided that &quot;Good Hope&quot; had escaped and called off the search at 22:15. Mindful of the reports that a British battleship was around somewhere, he turned north.

With no survivors from either &quot;Good Hope&quot; or &quot;Monmouth&quot;, 1,660 British officers and men were dead, including Admiral Cradock. &quot;Glasgow&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot; both escaped (the former suffering five hits and five wounded men). Just two shells had struck &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, neither of which exploded: one 6-inch shell hit above the armour belt and penetrated to a storeroom where, in Spee&#x27;s words, &quot;the creature just lay there as a kind of greeting.&quot; Another struck a funnel. In return, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; had managed at least 35 hits on &quot;Good Hope&quot;, but at the expense of 422 shells, leaving her with 350. Four shells had struck &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, one of which nearly flooded the officers&#x27; wardroom. A shell from &quot;Glasgow&quot; struck her aft turret and temporarily knocked it out. Three of &quot;Gneisenau&quot;″s men were wounded; she expended 244 of her shells and had 528 left.

==Aftermath==

This was Britain&#x27;s first naval defeat since the Battle of Lake Champlain in the War of 1812 and the first of a British naval squadron since the Battle of Grand Port in 1810. Once news of the defeat reached the Admiralty, a new naval force was assembled under Vice-Admiral Doveton Sturdee, including the battlecruisers and her sister-ship . This found and destroyed Spee&#x27;s force at the Battle of the Falkland Islands.

&quot;Glasgow&quot;, having escaped the battle, steamed south for three days at , passing through the Straits of Magellan. &quot;Canopus&quot;—warned by &quot;Glasgow&quot;″s messages—turned about and headed back at the best speed she could manage, . On 6 November, the two ships met and proceeded slowly towards the Falklands. Twice during the voyage &quot;Canopus&quot; had to report that she was not under control. After coaling, both ships were ordered north but again &quot;Canopus&quot; broke down. She was finally ordered to be beached in the inner part of Stanley Harbour, where she could serve as a defensive battery.

&quot;Otranto&quot; steamed out into the Pacific Ocean before turning south and rounding Cape Horn. On 4 November the Admiralty issued orders for the surviving ships to go to the Abrolhos Rocks, where a new force was being assembled. Rear-Admiral Archibald Stoddart, with the armoured cruisers and , were to meet them there and await the arrival of &quot;Defence&quot;. Sturdee was ordered to travel with the battlecruisers and —then attached to the Grand Fleet in the North Sea—to command a new squadron with clear superiority over Spee.

Despite his victory, Spee was pessimistic about his own chances of survival and dismissive with regard to the harm done to the British navy. The official explanation of the defeat as presented to the House of Commons by Winston Churchill was: &quot;feeling he could not bring the enemy immediately to action as long as he kept with &quot;Canopus&quot;, he decided to attack them with his fast ships alone, in the belief that even if he himself were destroyed... he would inflict damage on them which ...would lead to their certain subsequent destruction.&quot;

On 3 November &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, &quot;Gneisenau&quot; and &quot;Nürnberg&quot; entered Valparaíso harbour to a welcome by the German population. Spee refused to join in the celebrations; when presented with a bouquet of flowers, he refused them, commenting that &quot;these will do nicely for my grave&quot;. He was to die with most of the men on his ships on 8 December 1914, at the Battle of the Falkland Islands.

==Commemoration==

The Coronel Memorial Library at Royal Roads Military College, now Royal Roads University in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, was named in honour of the four Canadian midshipmen who perished in HMS &quot;Good Hope&quot; at the Battle of Coronel. In 1989 a memorial to those who perished in the battle was erected in the Plaza 21 de Mayo (&quot;21st May Square&quot;) at Coronel, Chile. Along with two plaques depicting HMS &quot;Good Hope&quot; and HMS &quot;Monmouth&quot;, it has a central dedication plaque (in Spanish) which reads

<doc id="191172" wikidata="Q533999" url="?curid=191172" title="SMS Scharnhorst">
<text>SMS was an armored cruiser of the Imperial German Navy, built at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany. She was the lead ship of her class, which included . and her sister were enlarged versions of the preceding ; they were equipped with a greater number of main guns and were capable of a higher top speed. The ship was named after the Prussian military reformer General Gerhard von Scharnhorst and commissioned into service on 24 October 1907.

 served briefly with the High Seas Fleet in Germany in 1908, though most of this time was spent conducting sea trials. She was assigned to the East Asia Squadron based in Qingdao, China, in 1909. After arriving, she replaced the cruiser as the squadron flagship, a position she would hold for the rest of her career. Over the next five years, she went on several tours of various Asian ports to show the flag for Germany. She frequently carried the squadron commanders to meet Asian heads of state and was present in Japan for the coronation of the Taishō Emperor in 1912.

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, and , accompanied by three light cruisers and several colliers, sailed across the Pacific Ocean to the southern coast of South America. On 1 November 1914, and the rest of the East Asia Squadron encountered and overpowered a British squadron at the Battle of Coronel. The defeat prompted the British Admiralty to dispatch two battlecruisers to hunt down and destroy the German squadron, which they accomplished at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914. The discovery of the wreck was announced in December 2019 by Mensun Bound.

== Design ==

The two -class cruisers were ordered as part of the naval construction program laid out in the Second Naval Law of 1900, which called for a force of fourteen armored cruisers. The ships marked a significant increase in combat power over the predecessors, the , being more heavily armed and armored. These improvements were made to allow for and to fight in the line of battle should the need arise, a capability requested by the General Department.

 was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . The ship displaced as designed and at full load. She was powered by three triple-expansion steam engines with steam provided by eighteen coal-fired water-tube boilers. Her propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . ″s crew consisted of 52 officers and 788 enlisted men; of these, 14 officers and 62 enlisted men were assigned to the squadron commander&#x27;s staff and were additional to the standard complement.

″s primary armament consisted of eight SK L/40 guns, four in twin gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the main superstructure on the centerline, and the remaining four mounted in single casemates. The secondary armament included six SK L/40 guns, also in individual casemates that were placed a deck below the main battery casemates. Defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of eighteen SK L/35 guns mounted in casemates. She was also equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes. One was mounted in the bow, one on each broadside, and the fourth was placed in the stern.

The ship was protected by a 15 cm belt of of Krupp armor, decreased to forward and aft of the central citadel. She had an armored deck that was thick, with the heavier armor protecting the ship&#x27;s engine and boiler rooms and ammunition magazines. The centerline gun turrets had thick sides, while the wing turrets received 15 cm of armor protection. The casemate secondary battery was protected by a strake of armor that was thick.

== Service history ==
Named for (Lieutenant General) Gerhard von Scharnhorst, a Prussian military reformer during the Napoleonic Wars, was laid down at the Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg, Germany on 22 March 1905, with the construction number 175. She was launched on 23 March 1906, and (Field Marshal) Gottlieb Graf von Haeseler gave a speech and christened the ship at her launching ceremony. She was commissioned into the fleet a year and a half later on 24 October 1907. She then began sea trials; while conducting speed tests she exceeded her design speed by one knot, reaching .

From 6 to 11 November, her trials were interrupted by a voyage to Vlissingen in the Netherlands and Portsmouth in Britain in company with Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s yacht and the light cruiser . On 14 January 1908, ran aground off the Bülk Lighthouse and suffered serious underwater damage. Repairs were made at Blohm &amp; Voss, and lasted until 22 February. She then resumed her trials, which continued until the end of April. On 1 May, she replaced as the flagship of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of (Rear Admiral) August von Heeringen. During the rest of the year, she participated in the normal peacetime routine of training exercises and fleet maneuvers.

=== East Asia Squadron ===

====1909–1911====
On 11 March 1909, was assigned to the (East Asia Squadron); replaced her as the reconnaissance squadron flagship. After completing preparations for the voyage, left Kiel on 1 April; aboard was Friedrich von Ingenohl, who was to take command of the East Asia Squadron upon his arrival. On 29 April, rendezvoused with , the flagship of the East Asia Squadron, in Colombo. There, took over the role of squadron flagship. At the time, the squadron also included the light cruisers and and several gunboats and torpedo boats. In July and August, went on a cruise in the Yellow Sea and in August surveyed ports in the area. She spent December and early January 1910 in Hong Kong for the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s festivities, in company with and the gunboat .

In January 1910 , , and went on a tour of East Asian ports, including Bangkok, Manila, and stops in Sumatra and North Borneo. By 22 March, and had returned to the German port at Qingdao. In the meantime, had left the East Asia Squadron in February; her replacement, , arrived on 9 April. Ingenohl, by now promoted to (Vice Admiral), departed on 6 June and was replaced by Erich Gühler. The new squadron commander took and on a tour of Germany&#x27;s Pacific colonies, starting on 20 June. Stops included the Mariana Islands, Truk, and Apia in German Samoa. In the last port, the cruisers met the unprotected cruisers and , the station ships for the South Seas Station. While there, the new light cruiser arrived on 22 July to further strengthen the East Asia Squadron.

In 1910, won the Kaiser&#x27;s (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the East Asia Squadron. On 25 November, and the rest of the squadron went on a trip to Hong Kong and Nanjing; while in Hong Kong, an outbreak of typhus struck. Among those who were infected was Gühler, who succumbed to the disease on 21 January 1911. In the meantime, unrest had broken out in Ponape, which required the presence of and . instead went on a tour of Southeast Asian ports, including Saigon, Singapore, and Batavia. She then returned to Qingdao by way of Hong Kong and Amoy, arriving on 1 March. There, Günther von Krosigk was waiting to take command of the squadron. Two weeks later, the squadron was reinforced by the arrival of ″s sister ship on 14 March.

From 30 March to 12 May, went on a cruise in Japanese waters with Krosigk aboard. She thereafter steamed to the northern area of the German protectorate in early July; at the time tensions were high in Europe due to the Agadir Crisis. Krosigk attempted to keep the situation calm in East Asia and he took his flagship on a tour of harbors in the Yellow Sea. By 15 September, the cruiser was back in Qingdao. After arriving in Qingdao, went into dock for her annual repair; Krosigk accordingly shifted his flag to temporarily. On 10 October, the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing Dynasty broke out, causing a great deal of tension amongst the Europeans, who recalled the attacks on foreigners during the Boxer Uprising of 1900–1901. The rest of the East Asia Squadron was placed on alert to protect German interests and additional troops were sent to protect the German consulate. But the feared attacks on Europeans did not materialize and so the East Asia Squadron was not needed.

====1912–1914====
By late November, was back in service and Krosigk returned to the ship. She cruised to Shanghai by way of Tianjin and Yantai, arriving on 12 December. From 14 to 24 January 1912, toured the ports of the central China coast and returned to Qingdao on 9 March, where the rest of the squadron had assembled. On 13 April, the ships went on a month-long cruise to Japanese waters, returning to Qingdao on 13 May. From 17 July to 4 September, went on another tour of Japanese ports and during this period she also visited Vladivostok in Russia and several ports in the Yellow Sea.

On 30 July, the Japanese Emperor Meiji died; escorted , which carried Prince Heinrich, Wilhelm II&#x27;s brother, to the Meiji Emperor&#x27;s funeral and the coronation ceremony for the Emperor Taishō. The ships remained in Japan from 5 to 26 September. After returning to Qingdao, Prince Heinrich conducted an inspection of the entire East Asia Squadron. On 4 December, Krosigk handed over command of the squadron to Maximilian von Spee. On 27 December, Spee took and on a tour of the southwest Pacific, including stops in Amoy, Singapore, and Batavia. The two cruisers reached Qingdao on 2 March 1913. From 1 April to 7 May, took Spee to Japan to meet the Taishō Emperor. Starting on 22 June, Spee began a tour of Germany&#x27;s Pacific colonies aboard his flagship. The ship stopped in the Marianas, the Admiralty Islands, the Hermit Islands, Rabaul in Neupommern, and Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen in German New Guinea.

While in Rabaul on 21 July, Spee received word of further unrest in China, which prompted his return to the Wusong roadstead outside Shanghai by 30 July. After the situation calmed, Spee was able to take his ships on a short cruise to Japan, which began on 11 November. and the rest of the squadron returned to Shanghai on 29 November, before she departed for another trip to Southeast Asia. Spee met with Vajiravudh, the King of Siam, and also visited Sumatra, North Borneo, and Manila. returned to Qingdao on 19 March 1914. In early May, Spee, by now promoted to , took and the torpedo boat on a visit to Port Arthur and then to Tianjin; Spee continued on to Beijing, where he met with Yuan Shikai, the first President of the Republic of China. He came back aboard on 11 May and the ship returned to Qingdao. Spee thereafter began preparations for a cruise to German New Guinea; departed on 20 June, leaving only behind in Qingdao.

 rendezvoused with in Nagasaki, Japan, where they received a full supply of coal. They then sailed south, arriving in Truk in early July where they would restock their coal supplies. While en route, they received news of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary. On 17 July, the East Asia Squadron arrived in Ponape in the Caroline Islands. Spee now had access to the German radio network and he learned of the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia on 28 July and the Russian mobilization against Austria-Hungary and possibly Germany on 30 July. On 31 July, word came that the German ultimatum that Russia demobilize its armies was set to expire. Spee ordered his ships be stripped for war. On 2 August, Wilhelm II ordered German mobilization against Russia and its ally, France.

=== World War I ===

When the First World War broke out, the East Asia Squadron consisted of , , , , and . At the time, was returning from the west coast of the United States, where had just replaced her, and was still in Qingdao. On 6 August 1914, , , the supply ship , and the Japanese collier were still in Ponape. Spee had issued orders to recall the light cruisers, which had been dispersed on cruises around the Pacific. joined Spee that day, after which Spee moved his ships to Pagan Island in the Northern Mariana Islands, a German possession in the central Pacific. Spee left for Pagan in the night, without , to avoid having the Japanese crew betray his movements.

All available colliers, supply ships, and passenger liners were ordered to meet the East Asia Squadron in Pagan and joined the squadron there on 12 August. The auxiliary cruiser joined Spee&#x27;s ships there as well. On 13 August, Commodore Karl von Müller, captain of the , persuaded Spee to detach his ship as a commerce raider. The four cruisers, accompanied by and several colliers, then departed Pagan on 15 August, bound for Chile. While en route to Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands the next morning, left the formation with one of the colliers. The remaining ships again coaled after their arrival in Enewetak on 20 August.

To keep the German high command informed, on 8 September Spee detached to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries. returned with news of the Allied capture of German Samoa, which had taken place on 29 August. and sailed to Apia to investigate the situation. Spee had hoped to catch a British or Australian warship by surprise, but upon his arrival on 14 September, he found no warships in the harbor. On 22 September, and the rest of the East Asia Squadron arrived at the French colony of Papeete. The Germans attacked the colony, and in the ensuing Battle of Papeete, they sank the French gunboat . The ships came under fire from French shore batteries but were undamaged. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented Spee from entering the harbor to seize the coal, which the French had set on fire.

By 12 October, and the rest of the squadron had reached Easter Island. There they were joined by and , which had sailed from American waters, on 12 and 14 October, respectively. also brought three more colliers with her. After a week in the area, the ships departed for mainland Chile. On the evening of 26 October, and the rest of the squadron steamed out of Mas a Fuera, Chile and headed eastward, arriving in Valparaíso on 30 October. On 1 November, Spee learned from that the British light cruiser had been anchored in Coronel the previous day, so he turned towards the port to try to catch her alone.

==== Battle of Coronel ====

The British had scant resources to oppose the German squadron off the coast of South America. Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock commanded the armored cruisers and , &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and the converted armed merchant cruiser . The flotilla was reinforced by the elderly pre-dreadnought battleship and the armored cruiser . The latter, however, did not arrive until after the Battle of Coronel. &quot;Canopus&quot; was left behind by Cradock, who probably felt her slow speed would prevent him from bringing the German ships to battle.

The East Asia Squadron arrived off Coronel on the afternoon of 1 November; to Spee&#x27;s surprise, he encountered &quot;Good Hope&quot;, &quot;Monmouth&quot;, and &quot;Otranto&quot; in addition to &quot;Glasgow&quot;. &quot;Canopus&quot; was still some behind, with the British colliers. At 16:17, &quot;Glasgow&quot; spotted the German ships. Cradock formed a line of battle with &quot;Good Hope&quot; in the lead, followed by &quot;Monmouth&quot;, &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and &quot;Otranto&quot; in the rear. Spee decided to hold off engaging until the sun had set more, at which point the British ships would be silhouetted by the sun, while his own ships would be obscured against the coast behind them. Cradock realized the uselessness of &quot;Otranto&quot; in the line of battle and detached her.

By 18:07, the distance between the two squadrons had fallen to and Spee ordered his ships to open fire thirty minutes later; each ship engaged their opposite in the British line. engaged &quot;Good Hope&quot; and hit her on the third salvo, striking between her forward gun turret and her conning tower and starting a major fire. Once the German gunners found the range, they began firing rapidly, with one salvo of high-explosive shells every fifteen seconds. (Lieutenant at Sea) Knoop, the spotting officer aboard , reported that &quot;Continual hits could be observed ... in the midships &quot;Good Hope&quot; was hit repeatedly, with much fire resulting ... the interior of this part of the ship was on fire, which could be seen through the portholes, shining brightly.&quot;

In the meantime, &quot;Glasgow&quot; began to shoot at both and , since she could no longer engage the German light cruisers. One of her shells struck in the forecastle but failed to explode. By 18:50, &quot;Monmouth&quot; had been badly damaged by and fell out of line; therefore joined in battling &quot;Good Hope&quot;. At the same time, closed to point-blank range of &quot;Monmouth&quot; and poured shells into her. At 19:23, &quot;Good Hope&quot;″s guns fell silent following two large explosions; the German gunners ceased fire shortly thereafter. &quot;Good Hope&quot; disappeared into the darkness. Spee ordered his light cruisers to close with his battered opponents and finish them off with torpedoes, while he took and further south to get out of the way.

&quot;Glasgow&quot; was forced to abandon &quot;Monmouth&quot; after 19:20 when the German light cruisers approached, before fleeing south and meeting with &quot;Canopus&quot;. A squall prevented the Germans from discovering &quot;Monmouth&quot;, but she eventually capsized and sank at 20:18. More than 1,600 men were killed in the sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Cradock. German losses were negligible. However, the German ships had expended over 40 percent of their ammunition supply. was hit twice during the engagement, but both shells failed to explode. The second hit passed through her third funnel and did not explode; she was struck by shell splinters that damaged her wireless antenna array. She suffered no casualties and the only German injuries were two slightly wounded men aboard .

====Voyage to the Falklands====
After the battle, Spee took his ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took , , and in first on the morning of 3 November, leaving and with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. In Valparaiso, Spee&#x27;s ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to determine the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, and were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, and met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.

Once word of the defeat reached London, the Royal Navy set to organizing a force to hunt down and destroy the East Asia Squadron. To this end, the powerful battlecruisers and were detached from the Grand Fleet and placed under the command of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee. The two ships left Devonport on 10 November and while en route to the Falkland Islands, they were joined by the armored cruisers , , and , the light cruisers and &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and the armed merchant cruiser . The force of eight ships reached the Falklands by 7 December, where they immediately coaled.

In the meantime, Spee&#x27;s ships departed St. Quentin Bay on 26 November and rounded Cape Horn on 2 December. They captured the Canadian barque &quot;Drummuir&quot;, which had a cargo of of good-quality Cardiff coal. took the ship under tow and the following day the ships stopped off Picton Island. The crews transferred the coal from &quot;Drummuir&quot; to the squadron&#x27;s colliers. On the morning of 6 December, Spee held a conference with the ship commanders aboard to determine their next course of action. The Germans had received numerous fragmentary and contradictory reports of British reinforcements in the region; Spee and two other captains favored an attack on the Falklands, while three other commanders argued that it would be better to bypass the islands and attack British shipping off Argentina. Spee&#x27;s opinion carried the day and the squadron departed for the Falklands at 12:00.

==== Battle of the Falkland Islands ====


 and were delegated for the attack; they approached the Falklands the following morning (8 December), with the intention of destroying the wireless transmitter there. Observers aboard spotted smoke rising from Port Stanley, but assumed it was the British burning their coal stocks to prevent the Germans from seizing them. As they closed on the harbor, shells from &quot;Canopus&quot;, which had been beached as a guard ship, began to fall around the German ships, which prompted Spee to break off the attack. The Germans took a southeasterly course at after having reformed by 10:45. was the center ship, with and ahead and and astern. The fast battlecruisers quickly got up steam and sailed out of the harbor to pursue the slower East Asia Squadron.

By 13:20, the British ships had caught up with and the other cruisers and began firing at a range of . Spee realized his armored cruisers could not escape the much faster battlecruisers and ordered the three light cruisers to attempt to break away while he turned about and allowed the British battlecruisers to engage the outgunned and . Meanwhile, Sturdee detached his cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. &quot;Invincible&quot; opened fire at while &quot;Inflexible&quot; attacked and Spee ordered his two armored cruisers to similarly engage their opposites. Spee had taken the lee position; the wind kept his ships swept of smoke, which improved visibility for his gunners. This forced Sturdee into the windward position and its corresponding worse visibility. straddled &quot;Invincible&quot; with her third salvo and quickly scored two hits on the British battlecruiser. The German flagship was not hit during this phase of the battle.

Sturdee attempted to widen the distance by turning two points to the north to prevent Spee from closing to within the range of his numerous secondary guns. Spee counteracted this maneuver by turning rapidly to the south, which forced Sturdee to turn south as well to keep within range. This allowed and to turn back north and get close enough to engage with their secondary 15 cm guns. Their shooting was so accurate that it forced the British to haul away a second time. After resuming the battle, the British gunfire became more accurate; was hit several times and fires broke out. The pace of her gunfire started to slacken, though she continued to score hits on &quot;Invincible&quot;. Sturdee then turned to port in an attempt to take the leeward position, but Spee countered the turn to retain his favorable position; the maneuvering did, however, reverse the order of the ships, so now engaged &quot;Inflexible&quot;.

By this stage of the battle, had a slight list to port and was about a meter lower in the water. Her third funnel had been shot away. was briefly obscured by smoke, which led both battlecruisers to target . By 16:00, Spee ordered to attempt to escape while he reversed course and attempted to launch torpedoes at his pursuers. The port list had increased significantly by this point and she was well down by the bow, with only of freeboard. At 16:17, the ship finally capsized to port and sank; the British, their attention now focused on , made no attempt to rescue the crew. All 860 officers and men on board, including Spee, went down with the ship. , , and were also sunk. Only managed to escape, but she was eventually tracked to the Juan Fernandez Islands and sunk. The complete destruction of the squadron killed about 2,200 German sailors and officers, including two of Spee&#x27;s sons.

In mid-1915, a coastal steamer found the body of a German sailor off the coast of Brazil. The sailor had a watertight cartridge case from a 21 cm shell attached; inside was one of the (Imperial war flags) flown aboard . The sailor was buried in Brazil and the flag was eventually returned to Germany, where it was placed on display at the Museum für Meereskunde (Marine Science) in Berlin, though it was lost during World War II.

<text>Life, the Universe and Everything (1982, ) is the third book in the six-volume &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; science fiction &quot;trilogy of six books&quot; by British writer Douglas Adams. The title refers to the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.

The story was originally outlined by Adams as &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen&quot; to be a Tom Baker &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television six-part story, but was rejected by the BBC. It was later considered as a plotline for the second series of the Hitchhiker&#x27;s TV series, which was never commissioned.

A radio adaptation of &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot; was recorded in 2003 under the guidance of Dirk Maggs, starring the surviving members of the cast of the original &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; radio series. Adams himself, at his own suggestion, makes a cameo appearance; due to his death before production began on the series, this was achieved by sampling his character&#x27;s dialogue from an audio book of the novel read by Adams that was published in the 1990s. The radio adaptation debuted on BBC Radio 4 in September 2004.

==Plot summary==
After being stranded on pre-historic Earth after the events in &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, Arthur Dent is met by his old friend Ford Prefect, who drags him into a space-time eddy, represented by an anachronistic sofa. The two end up at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground two days before the Earth&#x27;s destruction by the Vogons. Shortly after they arrive, a squad of robots land in a spaceship in the middle of the field and attack the assembled crowd, stealing the Ashes before departing. Another spaceship arrives, the &quot;Starship Bistromath&quot;, helmed by Slartibartfast, who discovers he is too late to stop the theft and requests Arthur and Ford&#x27;s help.

As they travel to their next destination, Slartibartfast explains that he is trying to stop the robots from collecting all the components of the Wikkit Gate. Long ago, the peaceful population of the planet of Krikkit, unaware of the rest of the Universe due to a dust cloud that surrounded its solar system, were surprised to find the wreckage of a spacecraft on their planet. Reverse engineering the vessel, they explored past the dust cloud and saw the rest of the Universe, immediately taking a disliking to it and deciding that it must be destroyed. They built a fleet of ships and robots to attack the rest of the Universe in a brutal onslaught known as the Krikkit Wars, but were eventually defeated. Realizing that the Krikkit population would not be satisfied alongside the existence of the rest of the Universe, it was decided to lock the planet in a Slo-Time envelope, to be opened only after the Universe has ended so that the planet can exist alone. The Wikkit Gate, shaped exactly like a wicket used in the sport of cricket, is needed to unlock the envelope. However, one ship carrying a troop of robots from Krikkit avoided being sealed in, and these robots began to search for the pieces of the Gate after they were dispersed about space and time.

Slartibartfast, Arthur, and Ford transport to an airborne party that has lasted numerous generations where another Gate component, the Silver Bail, is to be found, but Arthur finds himself separated from the others and ends up at a Cathedral of Hate created by a being called Agrajag. Agrajag reveals that he has been reincarnated countless times in a wide variety of forms, only to be killed by Arthur in each life; he now plans to kill Arthur in revenge. However, upon learning that Arthur has yet to cause his death at a place called Stavromula Beta, Agrajag realizes that he has pulled Arthur out of his relative timeline too soon and that killing him now would cause a paradox, but attempts to kill Arthur anyway. In his insanity, Agrajag brings the Cathedral down around them. Arthur manages to escape unharmed, partially due to learning how to fly after falling and missing the ground while catching sight of a bag he had lost at a Greek airport years before. After collecting the bag, Arthur inadvertently comes across the flying party and rejoins his friends. Inside, they find Trillian, but they are too late to stop the robots from stealing the Silver Bail. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Slartibartfast return to the &quot;Bistromath&quot; and try to head off the robots activating the Wikkit Gate.

Meanwhile, the Krikkit robots steal the last two pieces, the Infinite Improbability Drive core from the spaceship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and a peg leg used by Marvin the Paranoid Android. They capture both Marvin and Zaphod Beeblebrox in the process.

The &quot;Bistromath&quot; arrives too late to stop the robots from opening the Gate, so its occupants transport to the planet to attempt to negotiate with the Krikkit people. To their surprise, they find that the people seem to lack any desire to continue the war, and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet. With help from Zaphod and Marvin, the group is able to infiltrate the facilities. Trillian deduces that the Krikkiters have been manipulated, reasoning that the people of Krikkit could not simultaneously be smart enough to develop their ultimate weapon—a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe—and also stupid enough not to realize that this weapon would also destroy them.

The characters discover that the true force behind the war has been the supercomputer Hactar. Previously built to serve a war-faring species, Hactar was tasked to build a supernova-bomb that would link the cores of every sun in the Universe together at the press of a button and cause the end of the Universe. Hactar purposely created a dud version of the weapon instead, causing his creators to pulverize him into dust, which thus became the dust cloud around Krikkit. However, Hactar was still able to function, though at a much weaker level. Trillian and Arthur speak to Hactar in a virtual space that he creates for them to explain himself. Hactar reveals that he spent eons creating the spaceship that crashed on Krikkit to inspire their xenophobia and incite them to go to war, also influencing their thoughts. However, when the Slo-Time envelope was activated, his control on the population waned. As he struggles to remain functional, Hactar apologizes to Trillian and Arthur for his actions before they leave for their ship.

With the war over, the group collects the core of the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and the Ashes, the only two components of the Wikkit Gate not destroyed by the robots, and returns Zaphod and Marvin to the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. Returning to Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground only moments after the robots&#x27; attack, Arthur attempts to return the Ashes, but is suddenly inspired to bowl one shot at a wicket that is being defended using a cricket ball in his bag. However, during his run-up, Arthur suddenly realizes that the ball was created and placed in his bag by Hactar and is actually the working version of the cosmic-supernova-bomb, and that the defender of the wicket is one of the Krikkit robots, ready to detonate the bomb once thrown. Arthur trips, misses the ground, and flies over the pitch, allowing him to throw the bomb safely aside and behead the robot with its own bat.

Afterward, the group are taking Arthur to a &#x27;quiet and idyllic planet&#x27; when they come across a half-mad journalist. Some time earlier, he had been reporting on a court case in which a witness named Prak was inadvertently given an overdose of a truth drug. Prak began to tell all truth, horrifying the involved parties so badly that they abandoned the courtroom and sealed it up with him inside. The group find him still there, hoping to learn from him the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. They are disappointed to find that Prak has told all the truth in existence, but has forgotten it and kept no record. The only information he can provide is that the Ultimate Question and its answer can never both be known about in the same universe. He then attempts to tell Arthur where God&#x27;s last message to His creation is, though he dies seemingly before Arthur is able to memorize the location.

Arthur ultimately settles on Krikkit, where he becomes a more skillful flier and learns bird language. He is briefly interrupted by the arrival of an immortal alien who has made it his goal to insult every living creature in the universe, but the alien realizes that he has already done so with Arthur on prehistoric Earth.

==Origins==
The creation of Krikkit originally comes from &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen&quot;, a film treatment of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series. The treatment did not get far and was eventually scrapped. Elements of &quot;Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen&quot; were put into &quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;. According to Nick Webb, the writer of Adams&#x27;s official biography, he claimed that &quot;Douglas&#x27;s view of the Krikkitmen would be similar to his view of people who resolutely decline to learn what science can tell us about the universe we inhabit.&quot;

==References to the sport of cricket==
Several of the names and items in the story are references to (or puns on) terms associated with the sport of cricket, with the effect that the sport is jokingly portrayed as having cosmic antiquity and significance. These include the name of the sport itself (&quot;Krikkit&quot;), the wicket with its three pillars and two bails, the ball, and the Ashes.

==Censorship==
This book is the only one in the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series to have been censored in its US edition. The word &quot;asshole&quot; is replaced with the word &quot;kneebiter&quot;, and the word &quot;shit&quot; is replaced with &quot;swut&quot;. One example of censorship is in Chapter 21, in which the UK edition mentions that the &quot;Rory&quot; is an award for &quot;The Most Gratuitous Use of the Word &#x27;Fuck&#x27; in a Serious Screenplay&quot;. In the US edition, this was changed to &quot;Belgium&quot; and padded with a digression about the alleged cathartic utilization of off-color words (thereby allowing Adams to poke fun at the concept of censorship itself); and the text from the original radio series described &quot;Belgium&quot; as the most offensive word used in the galaxy.

==Audiobook adaptations==
There have been three audiobook recordings of the novel. The first was an abridged edition, recorded in 1984 by Stephen Moore, who played the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android in the radio series, LP adaptations and in the TV series. In 1990, Adams himself recorded an unabridged edition, later re-released by New Millennium Audio in the United States and available from BBC Audiobooks in the United Kingdom. In 2006, actor Martin Freeman, who had played Arthur Dent in the 2005 movie, recorded a new unabridged edition of the audiobook. Stephen Moore and Douglas Adams used the uncensored UK edition of the text, while both the censored and uncensored versions of the book are available read by Freeman, depending on where they are purchased.

<text>Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (, , ), commonly known as NDG, is a residential neighbourhood of Montreal in the city&#x27;s West End, with a population of 166,520 (2016). An independent municipality until annexed by the City of Montreal in 1910, NDG is today one half of the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. It comprises two wards, Loyola to the west and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce to the east. NDG is bordered by four independent enclaves; its eastern border is shared with the City of Westmount, Quebec, to the north and west it is bordered by the cities of Montreal West, Hampstead and Côte-Saint-Luc. NDG plays a pivotal role in serving as the commercial and cultural hub for Montreal&#x27;s predominantly English-speaking West End, with Sherbrooke Street West running the length of the community as the main commercial artery. The community is roughly bounded by Claremont Avenue to the east, Côte-Saint-Luc Road to the north, Brock Avenue in the west, and Highway 20 and the Saint-Jacques Escarpment to the south.

==History==
At the time of Montreal&#x27;s founding in 1642 most of the land stretching past Mount Royal to the northwest was a vast forest running the length of a long, narrow ridge known as the Saint Jacques Escarpment. The area that was to become Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was founded along that ridge, near a since-drained Lac Saint-Pierre. The first Europeans settled the area eight years after the founding of the colony of Ville Marie, on November 18, 1650. They were Jean Descarries (or Descaris) dit le Houx and Jean Leduc, from Igé, Perche, France.

Both settlers received of land in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, a vast territory that stretched from what would become Atwater Avenue to Lachine. The eastern part of the territory split off in 1874 as the village of Côte-Saint-Antoine, later renamed Westmount; a section then split off the western edge in 1897 to become Montreal West.

In 1853, construction of the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was completed.

In December 1876, the Municipality of the Village of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was established through proclamation. In 1906, the village of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was incorporated as a town. On June 4, 1910, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was annexed to the city of Montreal.

It was during this period that the long-established Descarries family reached its peak. Daniel-Jérémie Décarie (1836-1904) was mayor of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce from 1877 to 1904 and his son, lawyer Jérémie-Louis Décarie (1870-1927), was a Quebec parliamentarian.

In May 1912, Décarie Boulevard was officially designated, running north–south from Côte-des-Neiges and the Town of Mount Royal in the north to Saint-Henri and Côte-Saint-Paul in the south (a section of the road was already known as Décarie Avenue).

In 1908, the first tramway made its appearance in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, running around the north side of Mount Royal from Snowdon Station to the intersection of Mount Royal and Parc avenues.

Gradually the village developed around the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce which was the head church of the seven parishes on the western part of the Island of Montreal.

It was around 1920 that Anglophones began settling in NDG, resulting in the construction of numerous schools and churches. The Décarie Expressway opened to motorists in 1966, in time for Expo 67.

Since 2002, the area has been administratively attached to Côte-des-Neiges as the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.

==Geography==
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is bounded on the east by the border with Westmount and Côte-des-Neiges, the south by the Saint-Jacques Escarpment, and the north by Côte-Saint-Luc Road, extending west to the border with Montreal West.

===Westmount Adjacent area===
&quot;Westmount Adjacent&quot; is a term applied by realtors to a district along the eastern edge of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, located in between the city of Westmount to the east, the Décarie Expressway to the west, De Maisonneuve Boulevard to the south, and the lands of Villa Maria private Catholic girls school to the north. Both of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce&#x27;s metro stations, Vendôme and Villa-Maria, are located in the area.

The construction of the Décarie Expressway forced the displacement of 285 families and had a major impact on the neighbourhood, severing the easternmost part from the whole and leading to the area being referred to as Westmount Adjacent — a term implying housing costs and lifestyles more on par with Westmount, one of the most affluent communities in North America, rather than NDG which as a whole is more middle income.

==Demographics==

Broadly speaking Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is a middle class first-ring residential suburb with a culturally and linguistically diverse urban population. The cityscape and history of the community is rooted firmly in NDG&#x27;s role as a home for an upwardly-mobile French Canadian middle class that developed much of the land roughly between Confederation and the First World War. The neighbourhood is characterized by traditional Montreal housing styles - notably the detached or semidetached duplex - as well as being organized along the historic land division system developed by for agricultural purposes during Quebec&#x27;s colonial period (i.e. long, rectangular city blocks running perpendicular to a river or ridge). It is a predominantly residential neighbourhood with considerable appeal to a wide variety of Montrealers, owing principally to its local cultural cachet, proximity to the urban core of the city, and wide variety of commercial and public services.

NDG is a community of communities, as there are several somewhat distinct neighbourhoods within it. Officially the community is divided into an eastern and western ward with Cavendish Boulevard serving as the bisecting line. The eastern part of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce is itself split in two parts by the Décarie Expressway (running north–south), which was built in the late 1950s and resulted in the destruction of many hundreds of homes. The eastern ward is focused around the parish church at the intersection of Décarie and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce avenue, with many of the neighbourhood&#x27;s oldest buildings being found nearby. Owing to its history, the eastern ward is primarily francophone, middle class and has a strong French and Quebecois cultural and aesthetic character.

The western ward developed during the interwar and post-WW2 era and is more varied in terms of housing styles, income levels, cultural representation and spoken languages. Generally speaking NDG is associated with Montreal&#x27;s multi-ethnic middle-class anglophone community, given the presence of major anglophone institutions like Loyola College of Concordia University and the MUHC super-hospital, but despite this association many residents are bilingual in French and English and speak both on a regular, if not daily, basis.

Affordable housing and proximity to major anglophone post-secondary educational institutions, particularly Dawson College and Concordia University, has resulted in a large and consistent student population residing in NDG.

The visible minority population of the neighbourhood is 33%, with the ethnic breakdown of the neighbourhood varied over the territory of NDG.

There is also a sizeable Afro-Canadian and immigrant community, concentrated mostly around the parts of the district north of Somerled Avenue as well as south of Sherbrooke Street, and a &#x27;Little Italy&#x27; located south of the Canadian Pacific line, colloquially referred to as Saint Raymond. The area south of the Canadian Pacific Line, including Saint Raymond and Westhaven Elmhurst, with a population of 5915, has a black population of 19% and a Chinese population of 12%, both notably higher than Montreal as a whole. In recent years, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has developed into a highly desirable neighbourhood for young professionals, though little gentrification has occurred outside of the Monkland Village.

==Cityscape==

Geographically NDG is situated on a long plateau extending southwest from Mount Royal, cascading in wide terraces down from Côte-Saint-Luc Road ( being the French word for ridge) towards the far steeper Saint-Jacques Escarpment. The land is divided, as is traditional in Quebec, in long narrow strips, an evolution of the seigneurial land division system of the province&#x27;s colonial era. Thus, NDG has many avenues running north–south, but far fewer running east–west. As such, the community is characterized by several prominent boulevards where commercial activity is concentrated. This design element also traces its history back to the earliest urban design planning native to Canada.

NDG is almost exclusively residential and institutional in nature, defined in part by major Anglophone civic institutions anchoring its eastern and western ends. These are the MUHC hospital at the Glen Yards, adjacent to the Vendôme intermodal station and the Loyola campus of Concordia University (situated next to the Montreal-West commuter rail station, respectively). Public schools, libraries, places of worship, parks, playgrounds, and public athletic facilities, including a local chapter of the Montreal YMCA, are distributed throughout the area. Housing tends towards the antique, with much of the construction occurring between 1910 and 1940 and providing a unique mix of Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Beaux-Arts influences on traditional Quebecois architectural styles. There a variety of housing styles found in the borough, though the dominant and favoured style remains the red brick duplex row-house. Adding to its residential appeal, the community is well known for its tree-lined streets and general walkability.

An important housing project is situated near the geographical centre of NDG on Cavendish Boulevard, which bisects the borough into its eastern and western halves. The Benny Farm housing project was built to serve the needs of veterans returning from Second World War service, though was later designated as subsidized housing. The housing and surrounding landscaping was rehabilitated in the early 2000s, with new low-cost housing and additional public facilities built, such as the Benny Farm CLSC (a community centre with many social services including a clinic run by the provincial health ministry).

The Décarie Expressway trench and the mainline of the Canadian Pacific railway each forms barriers that arguably disrupt the cohesiveness of the borough. As such, sections of NDG have unique characteristics and be characterized as well-defined neighbourhoods. As an example, the sliver of NDG running between the rail line and the Saint-Jacques Escarpment (from Cavendish Boulevard to the Décarie Expressway) is known as St. Raymond&#x27;s and has a strong association with Montreal&#x27;s Italian community. Another section, separated from the rest of NDG by a highway trench and sharing a border with Westmount, is closer to where the village of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was founded, and as such is occasionally referred to as &#x27;Old NDG&#x27;.

NDG first rose to prominence as an important middle-class suburb towards the end of the 19th century, initially populated by the (then) new white-collar workforce of the Canadian metropolis and accessible via tramways running to and from the city centre. As widespread suburbanization developed in the post-WW2 period, NDG became home to successive waves of immigrants, first from Eastern Europe (including a sizeable Jewish population), then from the Caribbean, and more recently from Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Concurrently, Anglophone Montrealers consolidated in the West End broadly speaking, with Montreal&#x27;s Irish and Black communities shifting away from their traditional neighbourhoods (Griffintown and Little Burgundy respectively) and taking a more prominent position within the demographics of the area.

Today NDG is a cosmopolitan mixed-income urban neighbourhood highly sought after by young professionals. The multitude of services, including parks and other green spaces, schools, clinics, and major institutions, make it an ideal neighbourhood to raise a family close to the centre of the city of Montreal and its Central Business District. The vintage and antique housing is generally well kept and the aesthetic of the early 20th-century first-ring suburb has been preserved. Additionally, NDG is well-served by public transit, including numerous bus lines, two Métro, and two commuter train stations, allowing the area to be one of the most &#x27;walkable&#x27; in the entire city.

==Sports and recreation==
NDG is well known for many large parks including NDG Park (known as Girouard Park), Loyola Park, Trenholme Park, Benny Park, Somerled Park, and Parc de la Confédération. The area has three indoor hockey arenas: the public Doug Harvey Arena (formerly Confederation Arena) and the private Lower Canada College High School and Concordia University (Ed Meagher Arena) rinks. NDG is also home to the NDG YMCA, which includes a pool, gym, and recreation programs for youth and adults.

The community is home to several sports organizations for both children and adults, with NDG Hockey and NDG Baseball being the most well-known and respected organizations. NDG Baseball joined Baseball Québec in 2022 after many years and several championships as part of Little League Quebec.

NDG is home to the Montreal Exiles Rugby Football club (www.montrealexiles.com) who have mini-rugby teams (NDG Dragons) at U-6, U-8, U-10 U-12 and U-14 levels, Junior rugby at U-18 and senior men&#x27;s rugby. Founded in 2011, the senior men&#x27;s side featured in the provincial finals in 2011, losing to Westmount in the semi-final, and again in 2012 winning the Division C league and Cup. Their home field is Confederation Park.

==Transportation==
The public transport agency that operates transit bus and rapid transit services in Montreal is the Société de transport de Montréal (STM).

The 42-sided &quot;tetracontadigon&quot; is the largest such regular polygon that can only tile a vertex alongside other regular polygons, without tiling the plane.

42 is the only known formula_1 that is equal to the number of sets of four distinct positive integers formula_2 — each less than formula_1 — such that formula_4 formula_5 and formula_6 are all multiples of formula_1. Whether there are other values remains an open question.

42 is the magic constant of the smallest non-trivial magic cube, a formula_8 cube with entries of 1 through 27, where every row, column, corridor, and diagonal passing through the center sums to forty-two.

42 can be expressed as the sum of three cubes:formula_9

== Technology ==
* Magic numbers used by programmers:
** In TIFF (Tag Image File Format), the second 16-bit word of every file is 42, &quot;an arbitrary but carefully chosen number that further identifies the file as a TIFF file&quot;.
** In the reiser4 file system, 42 is the inode number of the root directory.
** In the military IRIG 106 Chapter 10 data recording standard, the hex value 0x464F52545974776F (ASCII &quot;FORTYtwo&quot;) is used as a magic number to identify directory blocks.
** The GNU C Library, a set of standard routines available for use in computer programming, contains a function—memfrob()—which performs an XOR combination of a given variable and the binary pattern 00101010 (42) as an XOR cipher.
** The password expiration policy for a Microsoft Windows domain defaults to 42 days.

== Wisdom Literature, Religion and Philosophy ==
* Abrahamic religions
** In Judaism, by some traditions the Torah scroll is written with no fewer than 42 lines per column, based on the journeys of Israel. In the present day, 42 lines is the most common standard, but various traditions remain in use (see Sefer Torah).
**42 is the number with which God creates the Universe in Kabbalistic tradition. In Kabbalah, the most significant name is that of the En Sof (also known as &quot;Ein Sof&quot;, &quot;Infinite&quot; or &quot;Endless&quot;), who is above the Sefirot (sometimes spelled &quot;Sephirot&quot;). The Forty-Two-Lettered Name contains four combined names which are spelled in Hebrew letters (spelled in letters = 42 letters), which is the name of Azilut (or &quot;Atziluth&quot; &quot;Emanation&quot;). While there are obvious links between the Forty-Two Lettered Name of the Babylonian Talmud and the Kabbalah&#x27;s Forty-Two Lettered Name, they are probably not identical because of the Kabbalah&#x27;s emphasis on numbers. The Kabbalah also contains a Forty-Five Lettered Name and a Seventy-Two Lettered Name. 42 letters make the Ana beKo&#x27;ach prayer.

== Popular culture ==
=== &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; ===
The number 42 is, in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, the &quot;Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot;, calculated by an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought over a period of 7.5 million years. Unfortunately, no one knows what the question is. Thus, to calculate the Ultimate Question, a special computer the size of a small planet was built from organic components and named &quot;Earth&quot;. The Ultimate Question &quot;What do you get when you multiply six by nine&quot; is found by Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect in the second book of the series, &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;. This appeared first in the radio play and later in the novelization of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. 
The fourth book in the series, , contains 42 chapters. 
According to , 42 is the street address of Stavromula Beta. 
In 1994, Adams created the &quot;42 Puzzle&quot;, a game based on the number 42. Adams says he picked the number simply as a joke, with no deeper meaning.

Google also has a calculator easter egg when one searches &quot;the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.&quot; Once typed (all in lowercase), the calculator answers with the number 42.

=== Jackie Robinson ===

* The jersey number of Jackie Robinson, which is the only number retired by all Major League Baseball teams. Although the number was retired in 1997, Mariano Rivera of the New York Yankees, the last professional baseball player to wear number 42, continued to wear it until he retired at the end of the 2013 season. As of the 2014 season, no player ever again wore the number 42 in Major League Baseball except on Jackie Robinson Day (April 15), when &quot;all&quot; uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wear the number.
** &quot;42&quot; is a film on the life of American baseball player Jackie Robinson.
** Miles Morales was bitten by a spider bearing the number 42, causing him to become a Spider-Man. The number was later heavily referenced in the film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;. The use of 42 within the franchise references Jackie Robinson&#x27;s use of the number, though many fans incorrectly believed it to be a &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; reference.

===Other===
In Japanese culture, the number 42 is considered unlucky because the numerals when pronounced separately—&quot;shi ni&quot; (four two)—sound like the word &quot;dying&quot;, like the Latin word &quot;mori&quot;.

<doc id="191179" wikidata="Q1681192" url="?curid=191179" title="James Thornhill">
<text>Sir James Thornhill (25 July 1675 or 1676 – 4 May 1734) was an English painter of historical subjects working in the Italian baroque tradition. He was responsible for some large-scale schemes of murals, including the &quot;Painted Hall&quot; at the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, the paintings on the inside of the dome of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and works at Chatsworth House and Wimpole Hall.

==Life==
Thornhill was born in Melcombe Regis, Dorset, the son of Walter Thornhill of Wareham and Mary, eldest daughter of Colonel William Sydenham, governor of Weymouth. In 1689 he was apprenticed to Thomas Highmore (1660–1720), a specialist in non-figurative decorative painting. He also learned a great deal from Antonio Verrio and Louis Laguerre, two prominent foreign decorative painters then working in England. He completed his apprenticeship in 1696 and, on 1 March 1704, became a Freeman of the Painter-Stainers&#x27; Company of London.

==Decorative schemes==


Thornhill decorated palace interiors with large-scale compositions, with figures commonly shown in idealized and rhetorical postures. In 1707, he was given the commission to decorate the Hall now known as the Painted Hall at the Old Royal Naval College (1707–1727). The scheme of allegorical wall and ceiling decorations of the hall depicts the Protestant succession of English monarchs from William III and Mary II to George I.

On 28 June 1715, Thornhill was awarded the commission to decorate the dome of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral by &quot;a whig, low-church dominated committee inspired by a moral Anglican nationalism&quot;. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Tenison, is said to have remarked: &quot;I am no judge of painting, but on two articles I think I may insist: first that the painter employed be a Protestant; and secondly that he be an Englishman&quot;. The &quot;Weekly Packet&quot; said that the decision to award Thornhill the commission would &quot;put to silence all the loud applauses hitherto given to foreign artists&quot;. The eight scenes in the dome (1716–19), executed in grisaille, show episodes from the Life of St. Paul.

Thornhill&#x27;s vast murals in great houses often related to topical events, as seen through the eyes of his mainly Whig patrons. At Chatsworth, during 1707-8, Thornhill painted a number of walls and ceilings, the most notable being the continuous wall and ceiling painting of the Sabine room, then a lobby, but since used as a bedroom. Here he painted The Rape of the Sabine Women, a vast panorama of mounted warriors carrying off the Sabine women to Rome. He chooses to feature strongly Hersilia, who was deified for her loyalty to her Roman husband, Romulus, as against her Sabine family - a deliberate reference to Mary, lauded by the Whigs for supporting her Protestant husband, William, against her Catholic father, James.

At Hanbury Hall, beneath an imposing view of both the Olympian Gods and the story of Achilles which dominates the ceiling of the main staircase, Thornhill added a small portrait of Rev Henry Sacheverell, a Tory propagandist put on trial for sedition by the Whig government in 1710, being cast to the Furies to be burnt. In 1716, Thornhill painted the ceiling of the Great Hall in Blenheim Palace for John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, newly returned to the country after being prosecuted by the Tory ministry in the last years of Queen Anne. The subject is, inevitably, the Duke&#x27;s 1704 victory at the Battle of Blenheim, during the War of the Spanish Succession.

His last major commission was to paint the chapel at Wimpole Hall; he started work on the preliminary sketches in 1713 and the work was finished by 1724. The north wall has fictive architecture and four Trompe-l&#x27;œil &quot;statues&quot; of the four Doctors of the Church. The east wall above the altar is painted with the Adoration of the Magi.

In 1725 he offered to paint decorations for the ceiling of the New Council Chamber at the Guildhall in the City of London. He gave his services free, although he was rewarded with a valuable gold cup. The chamber was later demolished, though some of the paintings – an &quot;Allegory of London&quot;, and representations of the Cardinal Virtues, personified as naked children – survive.

==Other works==
In his native Dorset Thornhill decorated the reredos at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Weymouth, with a picture of the Last Supper. Thornhill was also a notable portraitist.
He also carried out a commission in Worcestershire painting the walls and ceiling around the grand staircase at Hanbury Hall.

==Drawing academies==
In 1711, Thornhill was one of the twelve original directors of Sir Godfrey Kneller&#x27;s academy at Great Queen Street, London. In 1716, he succeeded Kneller as Governor there and held the post until 1720. He then established his own private drawing school at Covent Garden, but this soon closed. In November 1724, Thornhill made a second, more successful, attempt to establish a new free academy in his private house at Covent Garden. One artist that Thornhill is very likely to have influenced is the draughtsman and mathematical instrument designer Thomas Carwitham.

==William Hogarth==
William Hogarth seems to have been a member of Thornhill&#x27;s second academy from the beginning. On 23 March 1729 he married Thornhill&#x27;s daughter Jane. Thornhill was with Hogarth when he went to see Sarah Malcolm in Newgate prison just days before her execution. This was in order that Hogarth might record her portrait.

==Honours==
In June 1718 George I made Thornhill court painter, and in March 1720 Serjeant Painter, succeeding his former master Highmore in the latter role. On 2 May 1720, the king knighted him, the first native artist to be knighted. In the same year, he was master of the Painters&#x27; Company and in 1723 fellow of the Royal Society.

==Political career==
Thornhill was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Melcombe Regis at the 1722 British general election. He was returned in a contest at the 1727 British general election. During his time, he voted regularly with the Government. He presented to the church an altarpiece painted by himself.

==Houses and architecture==
In 1718 Thornhill took a large house on Covent Garden Piazza, and in 1725 he renovated Thornhill House in the south of Stalbridge, near Sturminster Newton, Dorset, in the Palladian manner.

In 1720 he tried his hand at architecture. Along with Giacomo Leoni, he designed Moor Park, for which he also painted the entrance hall ceiling and other rooms.

==Raphael cartoons==
Towards the end of his life Thornhill was receiving no major commissions, so he began to copy the Raphael Cartoons, then at Hampton Court. Apart from full-size copies, completed in 1731, he made a set at half-scale, plus 162 smaller studies of heads, hands and feet intending to publish them in printed form for the use of art students, but left this work unfinished at his death. The original small wash designs of details of the cartoons are now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

Thornhill&#x27;s copies of the cartoons were sold by auction by Christopher Cock on 24 and 25 February 1735 at his room in the Great Piazza, Covent Garden. The full-sized copies of the cartoons were bought by the 4th Duke of Bedford for £200, a very small sum which was less than the cost of the canvas and other materials used in making them. In 1800 the 5th Duke of Bedford presented them to the Royal Academy of Arts in London, where they remain.

<doc id="191184" wikidata="Q340142" url="?curid=191184" title="Avgas">
<text>Avgas (aviation gasoline, also known as aviation spirit in the UK) is an aviation fuel used in aircraft with spark-ignited internal combustion engines. &quot;Avgas&quot; is distinguished from conventional gasoline (petrol) used in motor vehicles, which is termed &quot;mogas&quot; (motor gasoline) in an aviation context. Unlike motor gasoline, which has been formulated without lead since the 1970s to allow the use of catalytic converters for pollution reduction, the most commonly used grades of avgas still contain tetraethyl lead, a toxic lead-containing additive used to aid in lubrication of the engine, increase octane rating, and prevent engine knocking (premature detonation). There are ongoing efforts to reduce or eliminate the use of lead in aviation gasoline.

Kerosene-based jet fuel is formulated to suit the requirements of turbine engines which have no octane requirement and operate over a much wider flight envelope than piston engines. Kerosene is also used by most diesel piston engines developed for aviation use, such as those by SMA Engines, Austro Engine, and Thielert.

==Properties==
The main petroleum component used in blending avgas is alkylate, which is a mixture of various isooctanes. Some refineries also use reformate. All grades of avgas that meet CAN 2–3, 25-M82 have a density of at . (6 lb/U.S. gal is commonly used in America for weight and balance computation.) Density increases to at , and decreases by about 0.1% per increase in temperature.
Avgas has an emission coefficient (or factor) of of CO2 or about 3.07 units of weight produced per unit weight of fuel used. Avgas is less volatile, with a Reid vapor pressure range of 5.5 to 7 psi, than automotive gasoline, with a range of 8 to 14 psi. A minimum limit ensures adequate volatility for engine starting. The upper limits are related to atmospheric pressure at sea level, 14.7 psi, for motor vehicles and ambient pressure at 22,000 ft, 6.25 psi, for aircraft. The lower avgas volatility reduces the chance of vapor lock in fuel lines at altitudes up to 22,000 ft.

The particular mixtures in use today are the same as when they were first developed in the 1940s, and were used in airline and military aero engines with high levels of supercharging; notably the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine used in the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters, Mosquito fighter-bomber and Lancaster heavy bomber (the Merlin II and later versions required 100-octane fuel), as well as the liquid-cooled Allison V-1710 engine, and air-cooled radial engines from Pratt &amp; Whitney, Wright, and other manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic. The high octane ratings were traditionally achieved by the addition of tetraethyllead, a highly toxic substance that was phased out of automotive use in most countries in the late 20th century.

Leaded avgas is currently available in several grades with differing maximum lead concentrations. (Unleaded avgas is also available.) Because tetraethyllead is a toxic additive, the minimum amount needed to bring the fuel to the required octane rating is used; actual concentrations are often lower than the permissible maximum. Historically, many post-WWII developed, low-powered 4- and 6-cylinder piston aircraft engines were designed to use leaded fuels; an unleaded replacement fuel is being developed and certified for these engines. Some reciprocating-engine aircraft still require leaded fuels, but some do not, and some can burn unleaded gasoline if a special oil additive is used.
==Consumption==
The annual US usage of avgas was in 2008, and was approximately 0.14% of the motor gasoline consumption. From 1983 through 2008, US usage of avgas declined consistently by approximately each year. As of 2024, the annual US usage of avgas was , most of which contained lead, and 170,000 aircraft in the US used leaded avgas.

In Europe, avgas remains the most common piston-engine fuel. High prices have encouraged efforts to convert to diesel engines burning jet fuel, which is more readily available, less expensive, and has advantages for aviation use.

==Grades==
Grades of avgas are identified by two numbers associated with its
Motor Octane Number (MON). The first number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to &quot;aviation lean&quot; standards, which is similar to the anti-knock index or &quot;pump rating&quot; given to automotive gasoline in the US. The second number indicates the octane rating of the fuel tested to the &quot;aviation rich&quot; standard, which tries to simulate a supercharged condition with a rich mixture, elevated temperatures, and a high manifold pressure. For example, 100/130 avgas has an octane rating of 100 at the lean settings usually used for cruising and 130 at the rich settings used for take-off and other full-power conditions.

Antiknock agents such as tetraethyl lead (TEL) help to control detonation and provide lubrication. One gram of TEL contains 640.6 milligrams of lead.


===100LL (blue)===
100LL (pronounced &quot;one hundred low lead&quot;) may contain a maximum of one-half the tetraethyllead allowed in 100/130 (green) avgas.

Some of the lower-powered () aviation engines that were developed in the late 1990s are designed to run on unleaded fuel and on 100LL, an example being the Rotax 912.

===Automotive gasoline===

Automotive gasoline – known as mogas or autogas among aviators – that does not contain ethanol may be used in certified aircraft that have a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for automotive gasoline, as well as in experimental aircraft and ultralight aircraft. Some oxygenates other than ethanol are approved, but these STC&#x27;s prohibit ethanol-laced gasolines. Ethanol-treated gasoline is susceptible to phase-separation which is very possible due to the altitude/temperature changes light airplanes undergo in ordinary flight. This ethanol-treated fuel can flood the fuel system with water which can cause in-flight engine failure. Additionally, the phase-separated fuel can leave remaining portions that do not meet octane requirements due to the loss of the ethanol in the water-absorption process. Further, the ethanol can attack materials in aircraft construction which pre-date &quot;gasahol&quot; fuels. Most of these applicable aircraft have low-compression engines which were originally certified to run on 80/87 avgas and require only &quot;regular&quot; 87 anti-knock index automotive gasoline. Examples include the popular Cessna 172 Skyhawk or Piper Cherokee with the variant of the Lycoming O-320.

Some aircraft engines were originally certified using a 91/96 avgas and have STC&#x27;s available to run &quot;premium&quot; 91 anti-knock index (AKI) automotive gasoline. Examples include some Cherokees with the Lycoming O-320 or O-360, or the Cessna 152 with the O-235. The AKI rating of typical automotive fuel might not directly correspond to the 91/96 avgas used to certify engines, as motor vehicle pumps in the US use the so-called &quot;(R + M)/2&quot; averaged motor vehicle octane rating system as posted on gas station pumps. Sensitivity is roughly 8–10 points, meaning that a 91 AKI fuel might have a MON of as low as 86. The extensive testing process required to obtain an STC for the engine/airframe combination helps ensure that, for those eligible aircraft, 91 AKI fuel provides sufficient detonation margin under normal conditions.

Automotive gasoline is not a fully viable replacement for avgas in many aircraft, because many high-performance and/or turbocharged airplane engines require 100 octane fuel and modifications are necessary in order to use lower-octane fuel.

Many general aviation aircraft engines were designed to run on 80/87 octane, roughly the standard (as unleaded fuel only, with the &quot;{R+M}/2&quot; 87 octane rating) for North American automobiles today. Direct conversions to run on automotive fuel are fairly common, by supplemental type certificate (STC). However, the alloys used in aviation engine construction are chosen for their durability and synergistic relationship with the protective features of lead, and engine wear in the valves is a potential problem on automotive gasoline conversions.

Fortunately, significant history of engines converted to mogas has shown that very few engine problems are caused by automotive gasoline. A larger problem stems from the higher and wider range of allowable vapor pressures found in automotive gasoline; this can pose some risk to aviation users if fuel system design considerations are not taken into account. Automotive gasoline can vaporize in fuel lines, causing a vapor lock (a bubble in the line) or fuel pump cavitation, thereby starving the engine of fuel. This does not constitute an insurmountable obstacle, but merely requires examination of the fuel system, ensuring adequate shielding from high temperatures and maintaining sufficient pressure in the fuel lines. This is the main reason why both the specific engine model as well as the aircraft in which it is installed must be supplementally certified for the conversion. A good example of this is the Piper Cherokee with high-compression engines. Only later versions of the airframe with different engine cowling and exhaust arrangements are applicable for the automotive fuel STC, and even then require fuel-system modifications.

Vapor lock typically occurs in fuel systems where a mechanically-driven fuel pump mounted on the engine draws fuel from a tank mounted lower than the pump. The reduced pressure in the line can cause the more volatile components in automotive gasoline to flash into vapor, forming bubbles in the fuel line and interrupting fuel flow. If an electric boost pump is mounted in the fuel tank to push fuel toward the engine, as is common practice in fuel-injected automobiles, the fuel pressure in the lines is maintained above ambient pressure, preventing bubble formation. Likewise, if the fuel tank is mounted above the engine and fuel flows primarily due to gravity, as in a high-wing airplane, vapor lock cannot occur, using either aviation or automotive fuels. Fuel-injected engines in automobiles also usually have a &quot;fuel return&quot; line to send unused fuel back to the tank, which has the benefit of equalizing the fuel&#x27;s temperature throughout the system, further reducing the chance of vapor lock developing.

In addition to vapor locking potential, automotive gasoline does not have the same quality tracking as aviation gasoline. To help solve this problem, the specification for an aviation fuel known as 82UL was developed as essentially automotive gasoline with additional quality tracking and restrictions on permissible additives. This fuel is not currently in production and no refiners have committed to producing it.

===Gasohol===
Rotax allows up to 10% ethanol (similar to E10 fuel for cars) in the fuel for Rotax 912 engines. Light sport aircraft that are specified by the manufacturer to tolerate alcohol in the fuel system can use up to 10% ethanol.
===Fuel dyes===
Fuel dyes aid ground crew and pilots in identifying and distinguishing the fuel grades
and most are specified by ASTM D910 or other standards.
Dyes for the fuel are required in some countries.

==Phase-out of leaded aviation gasoline==
The 100LL phase-out has been called &quot;one of modern GA&#x27;s most pressing problems&quot;, because 70% of 100LL aviation fuel is used by the 30% of the aircraft in the general aviation fleet that cannot use any of the existing alternatives.

There are three fundamental issues in using unleaded fuels without serious modification of the airframe/engine:
# The fuel must have a high enough octane rating (and meet other specifications) to replace leaded fuels,
# The engine must be certified to use the fuel, and
# The airframe must also be certified to use the fuel.

In February 2008, Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) announced that the company is very concerned about future availability of 100LL, and as a result, they would develop a line of diesel engines.
In a February 2008 interview, TCM president Rhett Ross indicated belief that the aviation industry will be &quot;forced out&quot; of using 100LL in the near future, leaving automotive fuel and jet fuel as the only alternatives. In May 2010, TCM announced that they had licensed development of the SMA SR305 diesel engine.

In November 2008, National Air Transportation Association president Jim Coyne indicated that the environmental impact of aviation is expected to be a big issue over the next few years and will result in the phasing out of 100LL because of its lead content.

By May 2012, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA Unleaded Avgas Transition rulemaking committee) had put together a plan in conjunction with industry to replace leaded avgas with an unleaded alternative within 11 years. Given the progress already made on 100SF and G100UL, the replacement time might be shorter than that 2023 estimate. Each candidate fuel must meet a checklist of 12 fuel specification parameters and 4 distribution and storage parameters. The FAA has requested a maximum of US$60M to fund the administration of the changeover. In July 2014, nine companies and consortiums submitted proposals to the &quot;Piston Aviation Fuels Initiative&quot; (PAFI) to assess fuels without tetraethyl lead. Phase one testing is performed at the William J. Hughes Technical Center for a FAA approved industry replacement by 2018.

In July 2021, the first commercially-produced unleaded avgas, GAMI&#x27;s G100UL, was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration through a Supplemental Type Certificate.

Lycoming Engines provides a list of engines and fuels that are compatible with unleaded fuel. However, all of their engines require that an oil additive be used when unleaded fuel is used: &quot;When using the unleaded fuels identified in Table 1, Lycoming oil additive P/N LW-16702, or an equivalent finished product such as Aeroshell 15W-50, must be used.&quot; Lycoming also notes that the octane rating of the fuel used must also meet the requirements stated in the fuel specification, otherwise engine damage may occur due to detonation.
Prior to , Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) indicated that leaded avgas is required in their engines, and not unleaded auto fuels: &quot;Current aircraft engines feature valve gear components which are designed for compatibility with the leaded ASTM D910 fuels. In such fuels, the lead acts as a lubricant, coating the contact areas between the valve, guide, and seat. The use of unleaded auto fuels with engines designed for leaded fuels can result in excessive exhaust valve seat wear due to the lack of lead with cylinder performance deteriorating to unacceptable levels in under 10 hours.&quot;

In , TCM changed its policy. They have announced a formal application to the FAA to approve the use of UL91 and UL94 in selected engines, stating that &quot;Continental considers 91UL and 94UL fuel as a transitional step in a long-term strategy to reach a more sustainable aviation&quot;.

==New unleaded fuel grades==

===91UL (or UL91)===
Hjelmco Oil first introduced unleaded Avgas grades in Europe in 2003, after its success with 80UL. This grade of Avgas is manufactured to meet ASTM D7547. Many common Lycoming engines are certified to run on this particular grade of Avgas, and Cessna has approved the use of this fuel in a large number of their piston fleet. This fuel is also usable in any aircraft in Europe or the United Kingdom where the engine is certified to use it, whether or not the airframe is certified to do so, too.

===93UL (Ethanol-free 93AKI automotive gasoline)===
The firm Airworthy AutoGas tested an ethanol-free 93 anti-knock index (AKI) premium auto gas on a Lycoming O-360-A4M in 2013. The fuel is certified under Lycoming Service Instruction 1070 and ASTM D4814.

===UL94 (formerly 94UL)===
Unleaded 94 Motor octane fuel (&quot;UL94&quot;) is essentially 100LL without the lead.
In March 2009, Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) announced they had tested a 94UL fuel that might be the best replacement for 100LL. This 94UL meets the avgas specification including vapor pressure but has not been completely tested for detonation qualities in all Continental engines or under all conditions. Flight testing has been conducted in an IO-550-B powering a Beechcraft Bonanza and ground testing in Continental O-200, 240, O-470, and O-520 engines. In May 2010, TCM indicated that despite industry skepticism, they are proceeding with 94UL and that certification was expected in mid-2013.

In June 2010, Lycoming Engines indicated their opposition to 94UL. Company general manager Michael Kraft stated that aircraft owners do not realize how much performance would be lost with 94UL and characterized the decision to pursue 94UL as a mistake that could cost the aviation industry billions in lost business. Lycoming believes the industry should be pursuing 100UL instead. The Lycoming position is supported by aircraft type clubs representing owners of aircraft that would be unable to run on lower octane fuel. In June 2010, clubs such as the American Bonanza Society, the Malibu Mirage Owners and Pilots Association, and the Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association collectively formed the &quot;Clean 100 Octane Coalition&quot; to represent them on this issue and push for unleaded 100 octane avgas.

In November 2015, UL94 was added as a secondary grade of unleaded aviation gasoline to ASTM D7547, which is the specification that governs UL91 unleaded avgas. UL91 is currently being sold in Europe. UL94 meets all of the same specification property limits as 100LL with the exception of a lower motor octane number (94.0 minimum for UL94 vs. 99.6 minimum for 100LL) and a decreased maximum lead content. UL94 is an unleaded fuel, but as with all ASTM International unleaded gasoline specifications, a &quot;de minimis&quot; amount of unintentionally added lead is permitted.

Since May 2016, UL94, now a product of Swift Fuels, is available for sale at dozens of airports in the United States. Swift Fuels has an agreement for distribution in Europe.

UL94 is not intended to be a full replacement for 100LL, but rather is designed to be a drop-in replacement for aircraft with lower-octane-rated engines, such as those that are approved for operation on Grade 80 avgas (or lower), UL91, or mogas. It is estimated that up to 65% of the fleet of current general aviation piston-engine-powered aircraft can operate on UL94 with no modifications to either the engine or airframe. Some aircraft, however, do require a FAA-approved Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) to be purchased to allow for operation on UL94.

UL94 has a minimum Motor octane number (MON, which is the octane rating employed for grading aviation gasoline) of 94.0. 100LL has a minimum MON of 99.6.

AKI is the octane rating used to grade all U.S. automotive gasoline (typical values at the pump can include 87, 89, 91, and 93), and also the 93UL fuel from Airworthy AutoGas.

The minimum AKI of UL94, as sold by Swift Fuels, is 98.0.

Concurrent with the addition of UL94 to ASTM D7547, the FAA published Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) HQ-16-05, which states that &quot;UL94 meets the operating limitations or aircraft and engines approved to operate with grade UL91 avgas,&quot; meaning that &quot;Grade UL94 avgas that meets specification D7547 is acceptable to use on those aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with ... grade UL91 avgas that meets specification D7547.&quot; In August 2016, the FAA revised SAIB HQ-16-05 to include similar wording regarding the acceptability of using UL94 in aircraft and engines that are approved to operate with avgas that has a minimum Motor octane rating of 80 or lower, including Grade 80/87.

The publication of the SAIB, especially the August 2016 revision, eliminated the need for many of the UL94 STCs being sold by Swift Fuels, as the majority of the aircraft on the STC&#x27;s Approved Model List are type-certified to use 80-octane or lower avgas.

On April 6, 2017, Lycoming Engines published Service Instruction 1070V, which adds UL94 as an approved grade of fuel for dozens of engine models, 60% of which are carbureted engines. Engines with displacements of 235, 320, 360, and 540 cubic inches make up almost 90% of the models approved for UL94.

===UL102 (formerly 100SF Swift Fuel)===

Swift Fuels, LLC, has attained approval to produce fuel for testing at its pilot plant in Indiana. Composed of approximately 85% mesitylene and 15% isopentane, the fuel is reportedly scheduled for extensive testing by the FAA to receive certification under the new ASTM D7719 guideline for unleaded 100LL replacement fuels. The company eventually intends to produce the fuel from renewable biomass feedstocks, and aims to produce something competitive in price with 100LL and currently available alternative fuels. Swift Fuels has suggested that the fuel, formerly referred to as 100SF, will be available for &quot;high performance piston-powered aircraft&quot; before 2020.

John and Mary-Louise Rusek founded Swift Enterprises in 2001 to develop renewable fuels and hydrogen fuel cells. They began testing &quot;Swift 142&quot; in 2006 and patented several alternatives for non-alcohol based fuels which can be derived from biomass fermentation. Over the next several years, the company sought to build a pilot plant to produce enough fuel for larger-scale testing and submitted fuel to the FAA for testing.

In 2008, an article by technology writer and aviation enthusiast Robert X. Cringely attracted popular attention to the fuel, as also did a cross-country Swift-Fueled flight by the AOPA&#x27;s Dave Hirschman. Swift Enterprises&#x27; claims that the fuel could eventually be manufactured much more cheaply than 100LL have been debated in the aviation press.

The FAA found Swift Fuel to have a motor octane number of 104.4, 96.3% of the energy per unit of mass, and 113% of the energy per unit of volume as 100LL, and to meet most of the ASTM D910 standard for leaded aviation fuel. Following tests in two Lycoming engines, the FAA concluded it performs better than 100LL in detonation testing and will provide a fuel saving of 8% per unit of volume, though it weighs more than 100LL. GC–FID testing showed the fuel to be made primarily of two components — one about 85% by weight and the other about 14% by weight. Soon afterward, AVweb reported that Continental had begun the process of certifying several of its engines to use the new fuel.

From 2009 through 2011, 100SF was approved as a test fuel by ASTM International, allowing the company to pursue certification testing. satisfactorily tested by the FAA, tested by Purdue University, and approved under ASTM specification D7719 for high-octane Grade UL102, allowing the company to test more economically in non-experimental aircraft.

In 2012, Swift Fuels LLC was formed to bring in oil and gas industry experience, scale up production and bring the fuel to market. By November 2013, the company had built its pilot plant and received approval to produce fuel in it. Its most recent patent, approved in 2013, describes methods by which the fuel can be produced from fermentable biomass.

The FAA scheduled UL102 for 2 years of phase 2 testing in its PAFI initiative beginning in the summer of 2016.

===G100UL===
In February 2010, General Aviation Modifications Inc. (GAMI) announced that it was in the process of developing a 100LL replacement to be called G100UL (&quot;unleaded&quot;). This fuel is made by blending existing refinery products and yields detonation margins comparable to 100LL. The new fuel is slightly more dense than 100LL, but has a 3.5% higher thermodynamic output. G100UL is compatible with 100LL and can be mixed with it in aircraft tanks for use.

In demonstrations held in July 2010, G100UL performed better than 100LL that just meets the minimum specification and performed as well as average production 100LL.

G100UL was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration by the issuance of a Supplemental Type Certificate at AirVenture in July 2021. The STC was initially only applicable to Lycoming-powered models of the Cessna 172. The company indicated that the retail cost was expected to be 0.60–0.85 US dollars per US gallon higher than 100LL. This was later revised to 1.00 US dollar per US gallon.

In 2022, Paul Bertorelli of AVweb reported that the FAA was dragging its feet on broadly certifying G100UL, delaying approval of the fuel for more engines and spending over $80 million on EAGLE to re-start a search for an unleaded fuel when G100UL had been under evaluation for over 10 years.

In September 2022, in a surprise announcement, the FAA approved an STC for the use of the fuel for all piston-engined aircraft and engine combinations. In February 2023, GAMI began selling supplemental type certificates to allow aircraft owners to use the fuel when it becomes available. In April 2024, GAMI announced that 1 million gallons of G100UL had been produced. Fuel availability in the US was forecast for airports in California, Washington and Oregon by the middle of 2024 and the rest of the country by 2026.

In December 2024, shortly after G100UL was made available at selected airports in California, several concerns regarding material compatibility arose, as users reported fuel leaks, paint staining, and paint stripping.

===Shell Unleaded 100-Octane Fuel===
In December 2013, Shell Oil announced that they had developed an unleaded 100 octane fuel and will submit it for FAA testing with certification expected within two to three years. The fuel is alkylate-based with an additive package of aromatics. No information has yet been published with regard to its performance, producibility or price. Industry analysts have indicated that it will likely cost as much as or more than existing 100LL.

===UL100E===
In 2018, LyondellBasell and VP Racing Fuels, an established motorsport fuel manufacturer, announced its intention to participate in developing an unleaded fuel for piston-powered aircraft. As of December 2024, it has reached Phase 4 of testing, according to the FAA.

==Environmental regulation==
TEL found in leaded avgas and its combustion products are potent neurotoxins that have been shown in scientific research to interfere with brain development in children. Children in residences or childcare facilities in close proximity to airports with moderate to high piston engine aircraft traffic are at especially high risk of high blood lead levels. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has noted that exposure to even very low levels of lead contamination has been conclusively linked to loss of IQ in children&#x27;s brain function tests, thus providing a high degree of motivation to eliminate lead and its compounds from the environment.

On November 16, 2007, the environmental group Friends of the Earth formally petitioned the EPA, asking them to regulate leaded avgas. The EPA responded with a notice of petition for rulemaking.

The notice of petition stated:

The public comment period on this petition closed on March 17, 2008.

Under a federal court order to set a new standard by October 15, 2008, the EPA cut the acceptable limits for atmospheric lead from the previous standard of 1.5 μg/m3 to 0.15 μg/m3. This was the first change to the standard since 1978 and represents an order of magnitude reduction over previous levels. The new standard requires the 16,000 remaining USA sources of lead, which include lead smelting, airplane fuels, military installations, mining and metal smelting, iron and steel manufacturing, industrial boilers and process heaters, hazardous waste incineration, and production of batteries, to reduce their emissions by October 2011.

The EPA&#x27;s own studies have shown that to prevent a measurable decrease in IQ for children deemed most vulnerable, the standard needs to be set much lower, to 0.02 μg/m3. The EPA identified avgas as one of the most &quot;significant sources of lead&quot;.

At an EPA public consultation held in June 2008 on the new standards, Andy Cebula, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association&#x27;s executive vice president of government affairs, stated that general aviation plays a valuable role in the USA economy and any changes in lead standards that would change the current composition of avgas would have a &quot;direct impact on the safety of flight and the very future of light aircraft in this country&quot;.

In December 2008, AOPA filed formal comments to the new EPA regulations. AOPA has asked the EPA to account for the cost and the safety issues involved with removing lead from avgas. They cited that the aviation sector employs more than 1.3 million people in the US and has an economic direct and indirect effect that &quot;exceeds $150 billion annually&quot;. AOPA interprets the new regulations as not affecting general aviation as they are currently written.

Publication in the USA Federal Register of an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the USA EPA occurred in April 2010. The EPA indicated: &quot;This action will describe the lead inventory related to use of leaded avgas, air quality and exposure information, additional information the Agency is collecting related to the impact of lead emissions from piston-engine aircraft on air quality and will request comments on this information.&quot;

Despite assertions in the media that leaded avgas will be eliminated in the US by 2017 at the latest date, the EPA confirmed in July 2010 that there is no phase-out date and that setting one would be an FAA responsibility as the EPA has no authority over avgas. The FAA administrator stated that regulating lead in avgas is an EPA responsibility, resulting in widespread criticism of both organizations for causing confusion and delaying solutions.

In April 2011 at Sun &#x27;n Fun, Pete Bunce, head of the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), and Craig Fuller, president and CEO of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, indicated that they both are confident that leaded avgas will not be eliminated until a suitable replacement is in place. &quot;There is no reason to believe 100 low-lead will become unavailable in the foreseeable future,&quot; Fuller stated.

Final results from EPA&#x27;s lead modeling study at the Santa Monica Airport shows off-airport levels below current 150 ng/m3 and possible future 20 ng/m3 levels. Fifteen of 17 airports monitored during a year-long study in the US by the EPA have lead emissions well below the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for lead.

==Other uses==
Avgas is occasionally used in amateur auto racing cars as its octane rating is higher than automotive gasoline thus allowing the engines to run at higher compression ratios.

<doc id="191187" wikidata="Q3236405" url="?curid=191187" title="USS New York (BB-34)">
<text>USS &quot;New York&quot; (BB-34) was a United States Navy battleship, the lead ship of her class. Named for New York State, she was designed as the first ship to carry the /45-caliber gun.

Entering service in 1914, she was part of the U.S. Navy force which was sent to reinforce the British Grand Fleet in the North Sea near the end of World War I. During that time, she was involved in at least two incidents with German U-boats, and is believed to have been the only US ship to have sunk one in the war, during an accidental collision in October 1918. Following the war, she was sent on a series of training exercises and cruises in both the Atlantic and the Pacific, and saw several overhauls to increase her armament, aircraft handling and armor.

She entered the Neutrality Patrol at the beginning of World War II, and served as a convoy escort for ships to Iceland and Great Britain in the early phase of the war. She saw her first combat against coastal artillery during Operation Torch around Casablanca in North Africa, and later became a training ship. Late in the war, she moved to the Pacific, and provided naval gunfire support for the invasion of Iwo Jima and later the invasion of Okinawa. Returning to Pearl Harbor for repairs until the end of the war, she was classified obsolete and was chosen to take part in the Operation Crossroads nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in 1946. She survived both explosions, and the effects of radiation on the ship were studied for two years. She was eventually sunk as a target in 1948. She received three battle stars for her service.

==Design and construction==

&quot;New York&quot; was the first of two planned s, though construction on her began after her sister, . She was ordered in fiscal year 1911 as the first class of battleship in the United States Navy to carry the 14-inch/45-caliber gun.
She had a standard displacement of and a full-load displacement of . She was in length overall, at the waterline, and had a beam of and a draft of .

She was powered by 14 Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers driving two dual-acting vertical triple expansion reciprocating steam engines, with , with a maximum speed of . She had a range of at .

Armor on &quot;New York&quot; consisted of a belt from thick. Her lower casemate had between of armor, and her upper casemate had of armor. Deck armor was thick, and turret armor was on the face, on the top, 2 inches on the sides, and on the rear. Armor on her barbettes was between 10 and 12 inches. Her conning tower was protected by 12 inches of armor, with 4 inches of armor on its top.

Her armament consisted of ten 14-inch/45-caliber guns which could be elevated to 15 degrees, and arrayed in five double mounts designated, from bow to stern, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The class was the last to feature a turret mounted amidships. As built, she also carried twenty-one /51-caliber guns, primarily for defense against destroyers and torpedo boats. The 5-inch guns were poor in accuracy in rough seas due to the open casemates mounted in the hull, so the 5-inch armament was reduced to 16 guns in 1918 by removal of the least useful positions near the ends of the ship. The ship was not designed with anti-aircraft (AA) defense in mind, but two /50 caliber AA guns were added in 1918. She also had four torpedo tubes, 1 each on the port side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern, for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 3 torpedo. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. Her crew consisted of 1,042 officers and enlisted men.

&quot;New York&quot; was laid down on 11 September 1911, in New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn. The &quot;New York&quot; class was constructed under new labor laws that limited the working hours of her construction crews. It was also stipulated that each ship cost less than $6,000,000, excluding cost of armor and armament. She was launched on 30 October 1912, and commissioned on 15 May 1914. The fifth ship to be named for New York State, she was sponsored by Elsie Calder, the daughter of New York politician William M. Calder. The fourth , an armored cruiser, was renamed &quot;Rochester&quot;, to free the name for this battleship, and was later scuttled in Subic Bay in 1941. However, the wreck site for that ship, which has become a popular recreational dive site, is still commonly referred to as USS &quot;New York&quot;.

==Service history==
Under the command of Captain Thomas S. Rodgers, &quot;New York&quot; headed straight for Veracruz following its commissioning. She was designated flagship for Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher in July 1914, commanding the fleet occupying and blockading Veracruz to prevent arms shipments from arriving there to support the government of Victoriano Huerta. The United States occupation of Veracruz ultimately ended and &quot;New York&quot; resumed her shakedown cruise along the East Coast of the United States. She also undertook several goodwill duties, and in December 1915 she held a high-profile Christmas party and dinner for several hundred orphans from New York City, at the suggestion of her crew. It later became a tradition on the ship to help the underprivileged when possible, earning it the nickname &quot;Christmas Ship.&quot; Following this duty, she undertook a number of training exercises off the Atlantic coast.

===World War I===

Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War I, &quot;New York&quot;, under the command of Captain Edward L. Beach, Sr., became flagship of Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9), commanded by Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman. She was sent to reinforce the British Grand Fleet in the North Sea, arriving at Scapa Flow on 7 December 1917. The ships of the U.S. fleet were assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron in the Grand Fleet, the American ships joined in blockade and escort. In December 1917, &quot;New York&quot; and the other U.S. battleships took part in several gunnery exercises. &quot;New York&quot; scored the highest score of the ships for her main battery, with an accuracy of 93.3 percent. Ultimately the &quot;New York&quot; was the best performer in these exercises, the only ship rated as &quot;excellent&quot; while many of her sisters received mediocre performance reviews.

She did not fire any shots in anger during the war, but does get credit for sinking an enemy vessel. During one of her escort missions, the convoy she was escorting came under two different attacks by German U-boats. On the evening of 14 October 1918, as &quot;New York&quot; led a group of battleships into the Pentland Firth, she was rocked by a violent underwater collision on her starboard side, followed shortly after by another to the stern that broke off two blades on one of her propellers, reducing the ship to one engine and a speed of . It was immediately clear to the men on board that she had struck an underwater object, but the depth of the channel meant it could not have been a shipwreck. Commanders concluded that &quot;New York&quot; must have accidentally collided with a submerged U-boat. They agreed that the submarine had rammed its bow into the ship&#x27;s side, then been struck moments later by the ship&#x27;s propeller. In their opinion, the damage would have been fatal to the German craft. This strange—and accidental—encounter marked the only time in all of Battleship Division Nine&#x27;s service with the Grand Fleet that one of its ships sank a German vessel. Postwar examination of German records revealed that the submarine lost may have been or , however, neither of these seem possible, as &quot;UB-113&quot; had been sunk by a French gunboat in the Gulf of Gascony weeks prior, and &quot;UB-123&quot; sank in the North Sea Mine Barrage five days &quot;after&quot; the &quot;New York&quot; suffered the collision.

Badly damaged by the loss of a propeller, the ship sailed to Rosyth under heavy escort for repairs on 15 October. At 01:00 the next morning, a U-boat launched three torpedoes at the damaged vessel, all of which passed ahead of her. Unlike in previous cases, sufficient evidence existed to suppose that this torpedo attack was not a false alarm—a number of officers and men aboard &quot;New York&quot; clearly saw the wakes of the torpedoes in the full moonlight, and a submarine was spotted in the immediate vicinity by a patrol shortly after the attack. Ironically, the battleship&#x27;s wounded condition is possibly what saved her: although standard procedure was to steam at , &quot;New York&quot; could make only on her one operable propeller. Due to this, historian Jerry Jones believes that the U-boat captain misjudged the ship&#x27;s speed. With no further damage, however, the battleship arrived safely at a drydock in Rosyth. As she was lifted clear of the water, a large dent commensurate with a submarine bow was found in her hull.
&quot;New York&quot; was also frequently host to foreign dignitaries, including King George V of the United Kingdom and the future Edward VIII, as well as then-prince Hirohito of the Empire of Japan. The ship was of great interest to other European powers, as it was in many cases a first chance to see an American dreadnought up close. She was on hand for the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918 in the Firth of Forth, several days after the signing of the Armistice, after which she returned to the United States briefly. She then served as an escort for , carrying President Woodrow Wilson, on his trip from the United States to Brest, France en route to the Versailles Peace Conference.

===Interwar period===
Arriving back in the United States in 1919, she began to undertake training and patrol duties, including at one point to the Caribbean with a number of other U.S. ships. During this year, she also saw a refit in Norfolk Navy Yard where five 5-inch guns were removed and three additional 3-inch/50 caliber AA guns were added, bringing the total to five. The secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch/51 caliber guns. In late 1919, she sailed to the Pacific Ocean and joined the newly formed United States Pacific Fleet. She continued to conduct training and patrol duties in the Pacific until the mid-1930s when she was transferred again to the Atlantic, and began operating out of the North Atlantic, with the exception of several occasional trips to the West Coast of the United States.
In 1926 &quot;New York&quot; was considered obsolete compared with other battleships in service, so she steamed to Norfolk Navy Yard for a complete refit. While several other battleships in service, including and were converted to training ships or scrapped, &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; were chosen to be overhauled to increase their speed, armor, armament, and propulsion systems as allowed by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. An additional were added to her for defense against aerial targets and submarines. The number of 3-inch AA guns was increased to 8, and six of the 5-inch guns were relocated to new casemates on the main deck. The torpedo tubes were removed at this time. Her 14 Babcock &amp; Wilcox coal-fired boilers were replaced with six Bureau Express oil-fired boilers and the twin funnels were trunked into one, aft of the forward superstructure. Tripods were fitted in place of lattice masts, and atop the forward tripod a control tower was installed. A tower was built amidships that contained additional fire control to backup the system on the foremast. A new aircraft catapult was installed atop turret Number 3, and cranes were installed on either side of the funnel for boat and aircraft handling. Additional deck protection was added, and her beam was widened to . She was fitted with anti-torpedo bulges. However, these bulges made maneuvering harder at low speeds, she rolled badly, and her gunfire accuracy was reduced in rough seas. On 4 September 1928, she left for short-range battle drills with , and from 7 to 10 November the ships traveled to San Francisco together with . On 3 April 1929 she undertook anti-aircraft practice with &quot;Arizona&quot;, and then the two ships and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; steamed for Cuba, where they stayed until steaming for Hampton Roads on 1 May.

She remained with the Pacific Fleet training as part of the series of Fleet Problems until 1939.

Fleet Problem I.  18-22 February 1923. &quot;New York&quot; participated in Fleet Problem I.  However, she patriated as an ersatz aircraft carrier, representing a &quot;Langley-&quot;type of aircraft carrier, with 15 planes embarked.   During the Fleet Problems ships were tasked to represent either different types of ships and /or multiple ships.  She was assigned to the ‘Black’ force.  This was the force tasked to attack the Panama Canal, which it was deemed to be successful.

Fleet Problem II.  2- 15 January 1924. The problem was to test if the US Fleet could voyage across the Pacific to engage Japan.

Fleet Problem III.  4-18 January 1924. The &quot;New York&quot; was assigned to the Blue force.  The Blue force was always designated to represent the United States’ Navy.  This force was tasked to transit the Panama canal from the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Seas.  While &quot;New York&quot; was transiting the canal, an intelligence officer from the opposing Black force was able to surreptitiously board the ship, enter turret number three and place his sea bag (which represented a bomb) in the turret’s magazine and thereby destroying the ship and rendering the canal inoperative.

Fleet Problem XIV.  10-17 February 1933.  New York participated as part of the Blue force engaged the aircraft carrier escorts for the Black aircraft carriers.  Two heavy cruisers were judged to be considerably damaged.  However, the carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot; was able to escape without simulated damaged from her guns.   &quot;New York&quot;, herself was judged to have suffered 34% damage.

Fleet Problem XVI.  29 April,- 10 June 1935.  &quot;New York&quot; along with battleship &quot;Oklahoma&quot; (BB-37) represented 3 battleships each and was assigned to the Black force.  They were charged to defend Midway Island.  A fight between the two forces battleships was engaged and Black was judged he winner, 2 of the ‘enemy’ battleships being judged  as sunk.     

Fleet Problem XX.  20-27 February 1939.  The ship was engaged in a traditional battleship on battleship tactical simulated battle.  The ship was judged to have been sunk through dive bomber and submarine attack.  The battleship then participated in a simulated invasion of Puerto Rico.

The &quot;USS New York&quot; took no further part in fleet exercises as she was deployed to the Atlantic as part of Franklin Roosevelt’s Neutrality patrols.

That year she was selected to carry now-Admiral Rodman, the President&#x27;s personal representative for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and &quot;New York&quot; took part in the Grand Naval Review of 20 May 1937 as sole U.S. Navy representative. In 1937, eight /75 caliber AA guns in two quadruple mounts were added to improve the light AA armament. &quot;New York&quot; was fitted with XAF radar in February 1938, including the first United States duplexer so a single antenna could both send and receive. This made her the second ship to be outfitted with radar after the destroyer . The tests conducted on &quot;New York&quot; led to similar radars being installed on the and cruisers as well as newer battleship . For several years, she served primarily as a training ship for midshipmen and newly enlisted sailors.

In September 1939, &quot;New York&quot; joined the Neutrality Patrol, safeguarding sea lanes in the North Atlantic, and served as flagship with the Atlantic Squadron, later redesignated the United States Atlantic Fleet, for the next 27 months. In July 1941, she protected a convoy of U.S. troops moving to garrison Iceland. She was in the midst of a refit on 7 December 1941, when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor, sinking many of the battleships in the U.S. Pacific Fleet and bringing the United States into World War II.

===World War II===
With the outbreak of war, &quot;New York&quot;″s overhaul was sped up and completed four weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. She returned to duty escorting cargo and troop ships to Iceland and Scotland. She continued on patrol duty for the next year. In her first series of escorts, she left Norfolk 15 February, arrived in New York 16 February, Nova Scotia 21 February, and Iceland 2 March, returning to Norfolk on 27 March. She left there on her second patrol 24 April and arrived at New York the next day, Nova Scotia 2 May, Newfoundland 5 May, and Iceland 10 May, returning to New York on 20 May. The next day she left for a third escort, arriving again at Nova Scotia on 2 June and Scotland on 10 June, returning to Norfolk on 30 June. Following these three escort missions, she put in for overhaul in Norfolk. The secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch (127 mm) guns and the anti-aircraft armament was increased to ten 3-inch/50 caliber guns, 24 Bofors guns in quadruple mounts, and 42 Oerlikon cannons. She departed Norfolk on 12 August and arrived the next day at New York. From there, she escorted a convoy to Nova Scotia where she remained until 22 August, then departed for Scotland where she was from 31 August to 5 September. She returned to Norfolk on 15 September.
&quot;New York&quot; saw her first major action during Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942. She left Norfolk on 23 October in order to join the Allied fleet. Attached to the Southern Attack Group, on 8 November, &quot;New York&quot; and the cruiser , screened by six destroyers, attacked Safi harbor in Morocco, supporting landings by the U.S. 9th Infantry Division&#x27;s 47th Infantry Regiment, and defended the transports and which came under attack by shore batteries at Point De La Tour. &quot;New York&quot; fired several salvoes with her guns, with one of them striking the base of the battery and ricocheting into a bunker, destroying the range finder and killing the battery commander and neutralizing the battery. Other shore batteries were destroyed by &quot;Philadelphia&quot;″s guns and aircraft from escort carrier . &quot;New York&quot; remained on station until the port was secure, then steamed north to support the Center Group off Fedhala and Casablanca, specifically to deal with the threat of the Vichy French battleship &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, but by the time she arrived, that battleship had been disabled by and other Vichy French ships had been driven off by and . &quot;New York&quot; remained on off the coast of North Africa until the beaches were secure, then retired on 14 November. She had expended a total of sixty rounds. She returned to Norfolk on 23 November.

&quot;New York&quot; next returned to convoy patrol. She escorted two convoys to Casablanca from the United States during late 1942, leaving Norfolk on 24 November and in New York from 25 November to 12 December, Casablanca from 24 to 29 December, and back in Norfolk on 12 January 1943. She left Norfolk on the second escort on 26 February, in New York from 27 February to 5 March, in Casablanca from 18 to 25 March, and back to New York from 5 April to 1 May. In 1943 she was selected for a refit to become a main battery and escort training center. She arrived in Portland, Maine on 2 May, where she remained until 27 July. During her fourth and final refit in early 1943 her anti-aircraft battery was increased to ten 3-inch/50 caliber guns, forty 40 mm and thirty-six 20 mm guns. Improved fire control was added as well, and this ultimately increased her displacement to standard and full-load. She returned to Norfolk on 2 August 1943. She was used to train crews from the US Navy, US Coast Guard, and Allied navies on the 14-inch/45 caliber gun, the 3-inch/50 caliber gun, and the 20 mm and 40 mm guns, primarily because many newer ships used these weapons. Between July 1943 and June 1944 about 11,000 enlisted men and 750 officers trained on her in this capacity. However, the duty lowered morale among the crew and a large number of requests for transfer were put in. Following this duty, she was sent to the US Naval Academy and undertook three consecutive midshipmen cruises ferrying a total of 1,800 midshipmen from Annapolis to Trinidad between June and August 1944.

====Pacific theater====

Selected to return to action in the Pacific Theater in late 1944, she transited the Panama Canal on 27 November, and arrived in Long Beach, California on 9 December, breaking down at least once along the way and losing an observation plane in bad weather. She conducted refresher training off Southern California in December 1944 and January 1945. &quot;New York&quot; departed 12 January and rendezvoused with , , , &quot;Texas&quot;, and , forming a support force for the invasion of Iwo Jima. &quot;New York&quot; lost a blade off her port screw just before the invasion began and briefly put in for temporary repairs at Eniwetok from 5 to 7 February. She returned to the group, which was near Saipan, on 11 February. Together, they arrived at Iwo Jima on 16 February and began the pre-invasion bombardment. During the three days of shore bombardment that followed, &quot;New York&quot; expended 6,417 rounds, including 1,037 14-inch rounds. One of her salvoes struck the primary ammunition dump on the island, causing &quot;the most spectacular secondary explosion in the campaign.&quot; She retired from the area on 19 February and arrived at Ulithi on 21 February.

After a permanent repair to her port propeller at Manus from 28 February to 19 March, she rejoined Task Force 54 at Ulithi on 22 March in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. Joined by , , and &quot;West Virginia&quot;, the fleet of battleships began its bombardment of Okinawa on 27 March. Providing shore bombardment, and later naval artillery support for ground forces, &quot;New York&quot; was on station for 76 consecutive days, during which she expended 4,159 rounds of 14-inch ammunition and 7,001 rounds of 5-inch ammunition. She was subjected to a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 14 April which destroyed one spotting plane on its catapult, but the Japanese aircraft crashed from the ship and &quot;New York&quot; received only superficial damage, suffering two men injured. She was detached on 11 June, her gun barrels having been worn out by fire, and proceeded to Pearl Harbor to have her guns relined in preparation for the invasion of mainland Japan. She stopped by Leyte on 14 June and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 July. She was in the harbor on 15 August, the end of the war.

During World War II, &quot;New York&quot; spent 1,088 days with the Atlantic Fleet from December 1941 to November 1944, and 276 days with the Pacific Fleet. She expended a total of 53,094 rounds of all types totaling , traveled , spent 414 days underway, and consumed of fuel oil.

===Post-war===
Following the end of the war, &quot;New York&quot; entered the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, leaving Pearl Harbor on 2 September and arriving at San Pedro on 9 September with a load of veterans embarked. She then proceeded to New York City to take part in Navy Day celebrations.

Selected as a test ship for Operation Crossroads, she was used in nuclear bomb tests at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 with about 70 other ships, surviving both the Able and Baker tests. Following these tests, she was towed to Pearl Harbor to study the effects of the bomb blasts on her. On 6 July 1948, she was towed out to sea and used as target practice, and was sunk by several naval aircraft and ships.

<text>An experience economy is the sale of memorable experiences to customers. The term was first used in a 1998 article by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore describing the next economy following the agrarian economy, the industrial economy, and the most recent service economy. 

==Business theory==
Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore argue that businesses must orchestrate memorable events for their customers, and that memory itself becomes the product: the &quot;experience&quot;. More advanced experience businesses can begin charging for the value of the &quot;transformation&quot; that an experience offers, e.g. as education offerings might do if they were able to participate in the value that is created by the educated individual. This, they argue, is a natural progression in the value added by the business over and above its inputs.
Although the concept of the experience economy was initially focused on business, observations and theories have crossed into tourism, and architecture. The experience economy can be quantified as the economic value of an experience, which is a psychological process people can go through. The experience economy is often consumed as product or service, or as pure experience product such as sports, and online dating.

The experience economy is also considered the main underpinning for customer experience management.

==History==

This kind of behavior in a society has been observed and analysed much earlier by various authors and researchers. A good example can be found in the pioneering book of futurists Alvin and Heidi Toffler, &quot;Future Shock&quot;, first published in 1970, which Pine and Gilmore quote in their work. The Tofflers discuss rapid change in American society and explore ways for humans to adapt. In Chapter 10, &quot;The Experience Makers&quot;, they say that an economy is being created geared to the provision of psychic gratification, that a process of &quot;psychologization&quot; finds place and humans will strive for a better &quot;quality of life&quot;. Manufacturers of goods will add a &quot;psychic load&quot; to basic products, the psychic component of services will expand and we will witness the rise of &quot;experience industries&quot; whose sole output consists of pre-programmed experiences, including simulated environments that offer customers a taste of adventure, danger, or other pleasure.

In the early 1980s, consumer behavior researchers had begun to question the hegemony of the information processing perspective on the ground that it may neglect important consumption phenomena like daydreams and emotional responses. Morris Holbrook and Elizabeth Hirschman argue in their paper &quot;The Experiential Aspects of Consumption: Consumer Fantasies, Feelings, and Fun&quot; for the recognition of experiential aspects of consumption.

In 1992, German sociologist Gerhard Schulze researched inhabitants of the city of Nürnberg and did observe a new way of living where basic needs were covered and people merely were striving for a &quot;&quot;nice living&quot; (&quot;&quot;schönes Leben&quot;), experiencing life (&quot;er-leben&quot;&quot;). Schulze summarised his findings using the words &quot;Experience Society&quot; in his book &quot;Die Erlebnisgesellschaft&quot;, translated into English as &quot;The Experience Society&quot; in 1995. In the experience society people behave differently as consumers. A transformation finds place from the need for goods that are generally useful or functional, to a need for goods that deliver an individual experience. Demand and offerings for these experiences meet at the &quot;&quot;Experience Market&quot; (&quot;Erlebnismarkt&quot;&quot;).

In 1996, Danish researcher Rolf Jensen of the Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies writes in his article &quot;The Dream Society&quot; for The Futurist that American society is yielding to a society focused on dreams, adventure, spirituality, and feelings where the story that shapes feelings about a product will become a large part of what people buy when they buy the product. Jensen framed this trend as the commercialization of emotions. &quot;In 25 years, what people buy will be mostly stories, legends, emotion, and lifestyle.&quot;

==Stages of marketing a good or service==

A core argument is that because of technology, increasing competition, and the increasing expectations of consumers, services today are starting to look like standardized goods. Products can be placed on a continuum from undifferentiated (referred to as commodities) to highly differentiated. Just as service markets build on goods markets, so transformation and experience markets build on these newly commoditized services, e.g. Internet bandwidth, consulting help.

The classification for each stage in the evolution of products is:
*A &quot;commodity business&quot; charges for undifferentiated products.
*A &quot;goods business&quot; charges for distinctive, tangible things.
*A &quot;service business&quot; charges for the activities you perform.
*An &quot;experience business&quot; charges for the feeling customers get by engaging it.
*A &quot;transformation business&quot; charges for the benefit customers (or &quot;guests&quot;) receive by spending time there.

Proceeding to the next stage more or less requires giving away products at the more commodified level. For instance, to charge for a service such as new car warranties, one must be prepared to give away new cars to replace &quot;lemons&quot;. And to charge for transformations, one must be prepared to risk not being paid for the time one spends working with customers who do not &quot;transform&quot;.

Pine and Gilmore draw on Walt Disney, AOL, Nordstrom, Starbucks, Saturn, Kanye West, IBM and many others as examples.

==Criticisms==

Pine and Gilmore&#x27;s thesis has been criticized as an example of an overhyped business philosophy that emerged from the dot-com bubble during a period in which a rising U.S. economy was tolerant of high prices and inflated claims and imposed no limitations of supply or investment. Detractors contrast it with other service-economy theses, such as that laid out in &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot;, which places a clear focus on making measurably better use of scarce resources, usually considered to be the basis of economics. They claim that service management should stress efficiency over effectiveness.

The thesis has also been criticized from within the fields of tourism, leisure, and hospitality management studies, wherein well-established theories on the role of experiences in the economy went unacknowledged by Pine and Gilmore. Although continuing to influence business thinking, the Experience Economy has been superseded within the service marketing and management literature, whereby the economic value of all goods and business services is co-created or co-produced through the interaction between consumers and producers.

<text>Enterococcus is a large genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Bacillota. Enterococci are Gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains, and are difficult to distinguish from streptococci on physical characteristics alone. Two species are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans: &quot;E. faecalis&quot; (90–95%) and &quot;E. faecium&quot; (5–10%). Rare clusters of infections occur with other species, including &quot;E. casseliflavus&quot;, &quot;E. gallinarum&quot;, and &quot;E. raffinosus&quot;.

== Physiology and classification ==
Enterococci are facultative anaerobic organisms, i.e., they are capable of cellular respiration in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments. Though they are not capable of forming spores, enterococci are tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions: extreme temperature (10–45 °C), pH (4.6–9.9), and high sodium chloride concentrations.

Enterococci exhibit variable hemolysis on blood agar. Differences occur between species, and between strains of species. More virulent organisms are more likely to exhibit alpha (partial) or beta (complete) hemolysis than less virulent specimens of &quot;Enterococcus&quot;, which frequently exhibit gamma (absent) hemolysis.

Members of the genus &quot;Enterococcus&quot; (from Greek έντερο, &quot;éntero&quot; &#x27;intestine&#x27; and κοκκος, &quot;coccos&quot; &#x27;granule&#x27;) were classified as group D &quot;Streptococcus&quot; until 1984, when genomic DNA analysis indicated a separate genus classification would be appropriate.

==Evolution==

This genus appears to have evolved to .

== Pathology ==

Important clinical infections caused by &quot;Enterococcus&quot; include urinary tract infections (see &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;), bacteremia, bacterial endocarditis, diverticulitis, meningitis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Sensitive strains of these bacteria can be treated with ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin. In catheterized patients receiving intensive care, &quot;Enterococcus&quot; spp., have been reported the dominant cause of urinary tract infections, particularly in patients treated with cephalosporin antibiotics. Urinary tract infections can be treated specifically with nitrofurantoin, even in cases of vancomycin resistance.
=== Meningitis ===

Enterococcal meningitis is a rare complication of neurosurgery. It often requires treatment with intravenous or intrathecal vancomycin, yet it is debatable as to whether its use has any impact on outcome: the removal of any neurological devices is a crucial part of the management of these infections.
New epidemiological evidence has shown that enterococci are major infectious agent in chronic bacterial prostatitis. Enterococci are able to form biofilm in the prostate gland, making their eradication difficult. Cases of enterococcal meningitis, in the absence of trauma or surgery, should raise suspicion of an underlying intestinal pathology (e.g., strongyloidiasis).

== Antibacterial resistance ==
From a medical standpoint, an important feature of this genus is the high level of antibiotic resistance. Some enterococci are intrinsically resistant to β-lactam-based antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems), as well as many aminoglycosides. In the last two decades, particularly virulent strains of &quot;Enterococcus&quot; that are resistant to vancomycin (vancomycin-resistant &quot;Enterococcus&quot;, or VRE) have emerged in nosocomial infections of hospitalized patients, especially in the US. Other developed countries, such as the UK, have been spared this epidemic, and, in 2005, Singapore managed to halt an epidemic of VRE. Although quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) was previously indicated for treatment of VRE in the USA, the FDA approval for this indication has since been retracted. The rationale for the retraction of Synercid&#x27;s indication for VRE was based upon poor efficacy in &quot;E. faecalis&quot;, which is implicated in the vast majority of VRE cases. Tigecycline has also been shown to have antienterococcal activity, as has rifampicin.

&quot;Bacillus haynesii&quot; CD223 and &quot;Advenella mimigardefordensis&quot; SM421 can inhibit the growth of &quot;Enterococcus&quot; spp. 

== Water quality ==

In bodies of water, the acceptable level of contamination is very low; for example in the state of Hawaii, and most of the United States, the limit for water off its beaches is a five-week geometric mean of 35 colony-forming units per 100 ml of water, above which the state may post warnings to stay out of the ocean. In 2004, measurement of enterococci took the place of fecal coliforms as the new American federal standard for water quality at public saltwater beaches and alongside &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; at freshwater beaches. It is believed to provide a higher correlation than fecal coliform with many of the human pathogens often found in city sewage.

<doc id="191200" wikidata="Q4927100" url="?curid=191200" title="Stephen">
<text>Stephen or Steven is a common English first name. It is particularly significant to Christians, as it belonged to Saint Stephen ( ), an early disciple and deacon who, according to the Book of Acts, was stoned to death; he is widely regarded as the first martyr (or &quot;protomartyr&quot;) of the Christian Church.

The name, in both the forms Stephen and Steven, is often shortened to Steve or Stevie. In English, the female version of the name is Stephanie.

Many surnames are derived from the first name, including , all of which mean &quot;Stephen&#x27;s (son)&quot;. In modern times the name has sometimes been given with intentionally non-standard spelling, such as Stevan or [[Stevon]]. A common variant of the name used in English is Stephan ( ); related names that have found some currency or significance in English include Stefan (pronounced or in English), Esteban (often pronounced ), and the Shakespearean Stephano ( ). 

== Origins ==
The name &quot;Stephen&quot; (and its common variant &quot;Steven&quot;) is derived from Greek (), a first name from the Greek word (), meaning &#x27;wreath, crown&#x27; and by extension &#x27;reward, honor, renown, fame&#x27;, from the verb (), &#x27;to encircle, to wreathe&#x27;. In Ancient Greece, crowning wreaths (such as laurel wreaths) were given to the winners of contests. Originally, as the verb suggests, the noun had a more general meaning of any &quot;circle&quot;—including a circle of people, a circling wall around a city, and, in its earliest recorded use, the circle of a fight, which is found in the Iliad of Homer.

==Popularity==
In the United Kingdom, it peaked during the 1950s and 1960s as one of the top ten male first names (ranking third in 1954) but had fallen to twentieth by 1984 and had fallen out of the top one hundred by 2002. The name was ranked 201 in the United States in 2009, according to the Social Security Administration. The name reached its peak popularity in 1951 but remained very common through the mid-1990s, when popularity started to decrease in the United States.

In England and Wales, neither &quot;Stephen&quot; nor &quot;Steven&quot; was among the top 100 names for newborn boys in 2003–2007. In Scotland, &quot;Steven&quot; and &quot;Stephen&quot; were the eighth and tenth most popular names for newborn boys in 1975, but were not in the top ten in 1900, 1950 or 2000. &quot;Stephen&quot; was 68th in 1900, and 46th in 1950, while &quot;Steven&quot; was not in the top 100 either year. Neither spelling was in the top 100 names for newborn boys in Scotland in 2008.

In the United States, the spelling &quot;Stephen&quot; reached its peak of popularity between 1949 and 1951, when it was the 19th most popular name for newborn boys. It stayed in the top 100 boys&#x27; names from 1936 through 2000, and for most years between 1897 and 1921. In 2008 it was the 192nd most common name for boys. The spelling &quot;Steven&quot; reached its peak during 1955–1961, when it was the tenth most popular name for newborn boys. It stayed in the top 100 boys&#x27; names from 1941 through 2007. In 2008 it was the 104th most popular name for boys. Before the 20th century, the &quot;Steven&quot; spelling was heavily outweighed by &quot;Stephen&quot;, never reaching above 391st.

<doc id="191204" wikidata="Q314063" url="?curid=191204" title="Emperor Go-Momozono">
<text>, posthumously honored as , was the 118th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. He was named after his father Emperor Momozono. The wording of in the name translates as &quot;later&quot;, so he has also been referred to as &quot;Later Emperor Momozono&quot;, &quot;Momozono, the second&quot;, or &quot;Momozono II&quot;. 

Go-Momozono became Emperor in 1771, during the Edo period, and died eight years into his reign in 1779. Events during his reign were confined to a series of natural calamities that occurred in 1772, aside from that the political situation with the Shōgun was quiet. Things came to a head towards the end of Go-Momozono&#x27;s life in the form of a succession issue as the Emperor had no eligible successor. As a result, he hastily adopted a son on his deathbed who later became the next Emperor.

== Genealogy ==
He was the son of Emperor Momozono with a lady-in-waiting. Before becoming emperor, he was known as Imperial Prince Hidehito (英仁親王).

Consort and issue(s):
*Empress (&quot;Nyogo&quot;): Konoe Koreko (近衛 維子, 26 January 1760 – 6 November 1783), later Seikamō-in (盛化門院), daughter of Konoe Uchisaki (近衛内前)
**First Daughter: Imperial Princess Yoshiko (欣子内親王, 11 March 1779 – 11 August 1846), married to Emperor Kōkaku
*Adopted children: 
**Adopted Son: Imperial Prince Kanehito(兼仁親王, 23 September 1771 – 11 December 1840), later Emperor Kōkaku

==Events of Go-Momozono&#x27;s life==
===Early life===
Before Go-Momozono&#x27;s accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (&quot;imina&quot;) was or Hanahito. Prince Hidehito was born on August 5, 1758, and was the firstborn son of Emperor Momozono. After his father died in 1762, the title of Emperor went to his aunt who became known as Empress Go-Sakuramachi. Hidehito was deemed too young to become Emperor at the time but was named Crown Prince and heir 5 years later. Empress Go-Sakuramachi abdicated in favor of her nephew on January 9, 1771, and Prince Hidehito became Emperor immediately.

===As Emperor===

Little more than a year had passed into Go-Momozono&#x27;s reign before Japan was hit with &quot;The Great &quot;Meiwa&quot; Fire&quot;. On February 29, 1772, unofficial reports described a swath of ashes and cinders nearly five miles wide and long—destroying 178 temples and shrines, 127 daimyō residences, 878 non-official residences, 8705 houses of hatamoto, and 628 blocks of merchant dwellings, with estimates of over 6,000 casualties. All this devastation subsequently engendered the costs of reconstruction. The year 1772 as a whole was later called &quot;year of trouble&quot; because it was marked by an extraordinary succession of natural calamities. A contemporary pun was made linking the words &quot;Meiwa&quot; + &quot;ku&quot; (meaning &quot;&quot;Meiwa&quot; 9&quot;, that is, the year 1772 according to the era calendar) and the sound-alike word &quot;meiwaku&quot; (meaning &quot;misfortune&quot; or &quot;annoyance&quot;). In addition to the fire, a tempest struck the Kantō region, causing floods and ruining crops. Another storm brought flooding and high winds to the Kantō region, destroying an estimated 4000 houses in Edo alone. The era name (&quot;nengō&quot;) was changed at the end of the year to &quot;Anei&quot; (meaning &quot;eternal tranquillity&quot;); but this symbolic act proved to be futile. Epidemic diseases spread across the country in 1775 which resulted in 190,000 estimated deaths in Edo.
===Succession issue and death===
Go-Momozono&#x27;s Imperial Family lived with him in the Dairi of the Heian Palace, he never officially married and only had children with a court lady named Konoe Koreko (近衛維子). This family included at least 2 sons who died in infancy, and one 10-month-old daughter at the time of the Emperor&#x27;s early death. Emperor Go-Momozono became ill in 1779, but his daughter was not eligible to become empress due to her age. When it became clear that the Emperor would not survive, his aunt former Empress Go-Sakuramachi had him adopt a son on his deathbed. The adopted son was from the Kan&#x27;in branch of the Imperial family, and would become the next Emperor. Go-Momozono died on December 16, 1779, at the age of 21 and his adopted son &quot;Prince Morohito&quot; became Emperor Kōkaku in the following year. Go-Momozono&#x27;s only daughter Princess Yoshiko would later become Kōkaku&#x27;s chief wife (&quot;chūgū&quot;).

Go-Momozono&#x27;s &quot;kami&quot; is enshrined in the Imperial mausoleum, &quot;Tsuki no wa no misasagi,&quot; at Sennyū-ji in Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto. Also enshrined in this location are this Emperor&#x27;s immediate Imperial predecessors since Emperor Go-Mizunoo – Meishō, Go-Kōmyō, Go-Sai, Reigen, Higashiyama, Nakamikado, Sakuramachi, Momozono and Go-Sakuramachi. The shrine complex also encompasses the misasagi of three of Go-Momozono&#x27;s immediate successors – Kōkaku, Ninkō, and Kōmei.

==Eras and Kugyō==
The years of Go-Momozono&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;: While is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Go-Momozono&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, &quot;Udaijin&quot;, &quot;Naidaijin&quot;, and &quot;Dainagon&quot;.

The following eras occurred during Go-Momozono&#x27;s reign: 

* &quot;Meiwa&quot; (1764–1772)
* &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; (1772–1781)

<text> is a Latin phrase, directly translated as &quot;by the fact itself&quot;, which means that a specific phenomenon is a &quot;direct&quot; consequence, a resultant &quot;effect&quot;, of the action in question, instead of being brought about by a previous action. (Contrast this with the expressions &quot;by itself&quot; or &quot;&quot;.) It is a term of art used in philosophy, law, and science.

Aside from its technical uses, it occurs frequently in literature, particularly in scholarly addenda: e.g., &quot;Faustus had signed his life away, and was, , incapable of repentance&quot; (from Christopher Marlowe, &quot;The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus&quot;) or &quot;These prejudices are rooted in the idea that every tramp is a blackguard&quot; (from George Orwell, &quot;Down and Out in Paris and London&quot;).

==In Catholic canon law==

 denotes the automatic character of the loss of membership in a religious body by someone guilty of a specified action. Within the canon law of the Catholic Church, the phrase is more commonly used than with regard to ecclesiastical penalties such as excommunication. It indicates that the effect follows even if no verdict (in Latin, ) is pronounced by an ecclesiastical superior or tribunal.

<doc id="191208" wikidata="Q188620" url="?curid=191208" title="Rigoberta Menchú">
<text>Rigoberta Menchú Tum (; born 9 January 1959) is a K&#x27;iche&#x27; Guatemalan human rights activist, feminist, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate. Menchú has dedicated her life to publicizing the rights of Guatemala&#x27;s Indigenous peoples during and after the Guatemalan Civil War (1960–1996), and to promoting Indigenous rights internationally.

In 1992 she received the Nobel Peace Prize, became an UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, and received the Prince of Asturias Award in 1998. Menchú is also the subject of the testimonial biography &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchú&quot; (1983) author of the autobiographical work, &quot;Crossing Borders&quot; (1998), and is subject interest among other works. Menchú founded the country&#x27;s first indigenous political party, Winaq, and ran for president of Guatemala in 2007 and 2011 as its candidate.

==Personal life==
Rigoberta Menchú was born to a poor Indigenous family of K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya descent in Laj Chimel, a rural area in the north-central Guatemalan province of El Quiché. Her family was one of many Indigenous families who could not sustain themselves on the small pieces of land they were left with after the Spanish conquest of Guatemala. Menchú&#x27;s mother began her career as a midwife at age sixteen and continued to practice using traditional medicinal plants until she was murdered at age 43. Her father was a prominent activist for the rights of Indigenous farmers in Guatemala. Both of her parents regularly attended Catholic church, but her mother remained connected to her Maya spirituality and identity. She believes in many teachings of the Catholic Church, but her mother&#x27;s Maya influence also taught Menchú the importance of living in harmony with nature and retaining her Maya culture. Menchú considers herself to be the perfect mix of both her parents.

In 1979–80, Menchú&#x27;s brother, Patrocinio, and mother, Juana Tum Kótoja, were kidnapped, brutally tortured and murdered by the Guatemalan Army. Her father, Vicente Menchú Perez, died in the 1980 Burning of the Spanish Embassy, which occurred after urban guerrillas took hostages and were attacked by government security forces. In January 2015, Pedro García Arredondo, a former police commander of the Guatemalan Army who later served as the chief of the now defunct National Police (Policía Nacional, PN), was convicted of attempted murder and crimes against humanity for his role in the embassy attack; Arrendondo was also previously convicted in 2012 of ordering the enforced disappearance of agronomy student Édgar Enrique Sáenz Calito during the country&#x27;s long-running internal armed conflict.

In 1984, Menchú&#x27;s other brother, Victor, was shot to death after he surrendered to the Guatemalan Army, was threatened by soldiers, and tried to escape.

In 1995, Menchú married Ángel Canil, a Guatemalan, in a Mayan ceremony. They had a Catholic wedding in January 1998; at that time they also buried their son Tz&#x27;unun (&quot;hummingbird&quot; in K’iche’ Maya), who had died after being born prematurely in December. They adopted a son, Mash Nahual Ja&#x27; (&quot;Spirit of Water&quot;).

Menchú featured prominently in the 1983 documentary &quot;When the Mountains Tremble&quot;, directed by Newton Thomas Sigel and Pamela Yates.

She lives with her family in the municipality of San Pedro Jocopilas, Quiché Department, northwest of Guatemala City, in the heartland of the Kʼicheʼ people.

== Connections to the Guatemalan civil war ==
Following military coups that started with the CIA-orchestrated removal of President Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954, the Cuban revolution of 1959, and the Che Guevara&#x27;s commitment to create as many Vietnams as he could, the U.S. moved to condone and often support authoritarian rule in the name of national security. The Guatemalan Civil War lasted from 1962 to 1996 and was provoked by social, economic, and political inequality. An estimated 250,000 people were assassinated, including 50,000 &quot;desaparecidos,&quot; and hundreds of thousands of displaced individuals, either at the hands of the armed forces or the militarized civilians knows as &quot;Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil&quot; (Civil Defense Patrols). This made people nervous since arming civilians, let alone Indians, was not a very common occurrence in Guatemala and was, in fact, illegal according to the country&#x27;s constitution.

Massacres of Indian men, women, and children in Guatemala began in May 1978, a stone&#x27;s throw away from a major Canadian nickel, culminating in 1982. By 1981 the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was reporting on the indiscriminate killing of civilians in rural areas, government soldiers being &quot;forced to fire at anything that moved&quot;. In 1982 the CIA reported several villages being burned to the ground while Guatemalan commanding officers were &quot;expected to give no quarter to combats and non-combats alike&quot;.

These inequalities were most impactful on marginalized populations, especially indigenous communities. To maintain order, the state implemented forceful measures that often, violated human rights. This ultimately led to mass genocide, disappearances, and displacement of indigenous populations. 83% of victims were later identified as Mayan, indicating that a majority of human rights violated were those of the Indigenous communities of Guatemala. These events had a deep impact on Menchú and her family and were the root cause of her activism in Indigenous rights.

== Guatemalan activism ==
From a young age, Menchú was active alongside her father. Together they advocated for the rights of Indigenous farmers through the Committee for Peasant Unity. Menchú often faced discrimination for wanting to join her male family members in the fight for justice, but she was inspired by her mother to continue making space for herself. Menchú believes that the roots of Indigenous oppression in Guatemala stem from issues of exploitation and colonial land ownership, and in her early activism focused on defending her people from colonial exploitation.

After leaving school, Menchú worked as an activist campaigning against human rights violations committed by the Guatemalan Army during the country&#x27;s civil war, which lasted from 1960 to 1996. Many of the human rights violations that occurred during the war targeted Indigenous peoples. Women were targets of physical and sexual violence at the hands of the military.

In 1981, Menchú was exiled and escaped to Mexico where she found refuge in the home of a Catholic bishop in Chiapas. Menchú continued to organize resistance to oppression in Guatemala and organize the struggle for Indigenous rights by co-founding the United Republic of Guatemalan Opposition. Tens of thousands of people, mostly indigenous Maya people, fled to Mexico from 1982 to 1984 at the height of Guatemala&#x27;s 36-year civil war.

A year later, in 1982, she narrated a book about her life, titled &quot;Me llamo Rigoberta Menchú y así me nació la conciencia&quot; (&quot;My Name is Rigoberta Menchú, and this is how my Awareness was Born&quot;), to Venezuelan author and anthropologist Elizabeth Burgos. The book was translated into five other languages including English and French. Menchú&#x27;s work made her an international icon at the time of the ongoing conflict in Guatemala and brought attention to the suffering of Indigenous peoples under an oppressive government regime.

Menchú served as the Presidential Goodwill Ambassador for the 1996 Peace Accords in Guatemala. That same year she received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award in Boston.

After the Guatemalan Civil War ended, Menchú campaigned to have Guatemalan political and military establishment members tried in Spanish courts. In 1999, she filed a complaint before a court in Spain because prosecutions of civil-war era crimes in Guatemala was practically impossible. These attempts stalled as the Spanish courts determined that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all possibilities of seeking justice through the legal system of Guatemala. On 23 December 2006, Spain called for the extradition from Guatemala of seven former members of Guatemala&#x27;s government, including Efraín Ríos Montt and Óscar Mejía, on charges of genocide and torture. Spain&#x27;s highest court ruled that cases of genocide committed abroad could be judged in Spain, even if no Spanish citizens were involved. In addition to the deaths of Spanish citizens, the most serious charges include genocide against the Maya people of Guatemala.

===Politics===
In 2005, Menchú joined the Guatemalan federal government as goodwill ambassador for the National Peace Accords. Menchú faced opposition and discrimination. In April 2005, five Guatemalan politicians would be convicted for hurling racial epithets at Menchú. Court rulings would also uphold the right to wear indigenous dresses and practice Mayan spirituality.

On 12 February 2007, Menchú announced that she would form an Indigenous political party called Encuentro por Guatemala and that she would stand in the 2007 presidential election. She was the first Maya, Indigenous woman to ever run in a Guatemalan election. In the 2007 election, Menchú was defeated in the first round, receiving three percent of the vote.

In 2009, Menchú became involved in the newly founded party Winaq. Menchú was a candidate for the 2011 presidential election, but lost in the first round, winning three percent of the vote again. Although Menchú was not elected, Winaq succeeded in becoming the first Indigenous political party of Guatemala.

== International activism ==

At the peak of state counterinsurgency, the Permanent Peoples’ Tribunal: Session on Guatemala (PPT-SG), held in Madrid in 1983, was the first of its kind for Central America. The tribunal looked at evidence going back to the CIA-backed coup that ousted democratically elected president Jacobo Árbenz in 1954; although its focus was on the massacres, scorched earth policies, forced disappearances, torture, and killings taking place at the time under General Efraín Ríos Montt. Menchú was included in the five-day tribunal, that included twenty-two testifiers, and shared how her mother was used as bait as an effort to trap her children:

Almost thirty years later, the First Tribunal of Consciousness Against Sexual Violence Toward Women took place in Guatemala City in 2010. The 1983 PPT-SG did not acknowledge the rape of women, particularly Maya women, during the armed conflict testifiers spoke; but it would take another twenty-seven years for sexual violence to be fully recognized in an ethical tribunal, and thirty-three years for it to be legally condemned in 2016 in the Sepur Zarco case. The trial and conviction of Jose Efrain Rios Montt in Guatemala in 2013 demonstrates that 15 years later, it is possible to convict a former head of state of crimes against humanity. Guatemala became the first Latin America country to place a former president on trial for genocide, being charged for the killing and disappearance of 70,000 people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands.

In 1996, Menchú was appointed as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador in recognition of her activism for the rights of Indigenous people. In this capacity, she acted as a spokesperson for the first International Decade of the World&#x27;s Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004), where she worked to improve international collaboration on issues such as environment, education, health care, and human rights for Indigenous peoples. In 2015, Menchú met with the general director of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, in order to solidify relations between Guatemala and the organization.

Since 2003, Menchú has become involved in the Indigenous pharmaceutical industry as president of &quot;Salud para Todos&quot; (&quot;Health for All&quot;) and the company &quot;Farmacias Similares,&quot; with the goal of offering low-cost generic medicines. As president of this organization, Menchú has received pushback from large pharmaceutical companies due to her desire to shorten the patent life of certain AIDS and cancer drugs to increase their availability and affordability.

In 2006, Menchú was one of the founders of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative along with sister Nobel Peace Laureates Jody Williams, Shirin Ebadi, Wangari Maathai, Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan Maguire. These six women, representing North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, decided to bring together their experiences in a united effort for peace, justice and equality. It is the goal of the Nobel Women&#x27;s Initiative to help strengthen women&#x27;s rights around the world.

Menchú is a member of PeaceJam, an organization whose mission is to use Nobel Peace Laureates as mentors and models for young people and provide a way for these Laureates to share their knowledge, passions, and experience. She travels around the world speaking to youth through PeaceJam conferences. She has also been a member of the Foundation Chirac&#x27;s honor committee since the foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac in order to promote world peace.

Menchú has continued her activism by continuing to raise awareness for issues including political and economic inequality and climate change.

====Testimony controversy====
More than a decade after the publication of &quot;I, Rigoberta Menchú&quot;, anthropologist David Stoll investigated Menchú&#x27;s story and claimed that Menchú changed some elements about her life, family, and village to meet the publicity needs of the guerrilla movement. Stoll acknowledged the violence against the Maya civilians in his book, &quot;Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of all Poor Guatemalans,&quot; but believed the guerillas were responsible for the army&#x27;s atrocities. The controversy caused by Stoll&#x27;s book received widespread coverage in the US press of the time; thus the &quot;New York Times&quot; highlighted a few claims in her book contradicted by other sources:

Many authors have defended Menchú, and attributed the controversy to different interpretations of the testimonio genre. Menchú herself states, &quot;I&#x27;d like to stress that it&#x27;s not only &quot;my&quot; life, it&#x27;s also the testimony of my people.&quot; An error in &quot;Rigoberta Menchu and the Story of all Poor Guatemalans&quot; is Stoll&#x27;s representation of the massacre at the Spanish embassy in Guatemala in 1980 as a self-immolation coordinated by student and indigenous leaders of the peasant protesters occupying the embassy; investigators in 1981 reported on the massacre and the La Comisión para el Esclarecimiento Histórico (Commission for the Historical Clarification-CEH) and published findings concluding that the army carried out a premeditated firebombing of the embassy.

Later, a declassified CIA document form late February 1982 states that in mid-February 1982 the Guatemalan army reinforced its existing forces and launched a &quot;sweep operation in the Ixil Triangle; and commanding officers of the units involved had been instructed to destroy all towns and villages which were cooperating in the Guerilla Army of the Poor (EGP) and eliminate all sources of resistance.&quot; Which was a fallacy recently repeated in the Times Literary Supplement by Ilan Stavans in his review of Stoll&#x27;s book. Some scholars have stated that, despite its factual and historical inaccuracies, Menchú&#x27;s testimony remains relevant for the ways in which it depicts the life of an Indigenous Guatemalan during the civil war.

The Nobel Committee dismissed calls to revoke Menchú&#x27;s Nobel Prize, in spite of Stoll&#x27;s allegations regarding Menchú. Geir Lundestad, the secretary of the committee, stated that Menchú&#x27;s prize was awarded because of her advocacy and social justice work, not because of her testimony, and that she had committed no observable wrongdoing.

According to Mark Horowitz, William Yaworsky, and Kenneth Kickham, the controversy about Stoll&#x27;s account of Menchu is one of the three most divisive episodes in recent American anthropological history, along with controversies about the truthfulness of Margaret Mead&#x27;s &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; and Napoleon Chagnon&#x27;s representation of violence among the Yanomami.

<doc id="191214" wikidata="Q125337" url="?curid=191214" title="Mandarin orange">
<text>A mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), often simply called mandarin, is a small, rounded citrus tree fruit. Treated as a distinct species of orange, it is usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. The mandarin is small and oblate, unlike the roughly spherical sweet orange (which is a mandarin-pomelo hybrid). The taste is sweeter and stronger than the common orange. A ripe mandarin orange is firm to slightly soft, heavy for its size, and pebbly-skinned. The peel is thin and loose, with little white mesocarp, so they are usually easier to peel and to split into segments. Hybrids have these traits to lesser degrees. The mandarin orange is tender and is damaged easily by cold. It can be grown in tropical and subtropical areas.

According to genetic studies, the wild mandarin was one of the original citrus species; through breeding or natural hybridization, it is the ancestor of many hybrid citrus cultivars. With the citron and pomelo, it is the ancestor of the most commercially important hybrids (such as sweet and sour oranges, grapefruit, and many lemons and limes). Though the ancestral mandarin orange was bitter, most commercial mandarin strains derive from hybridization with the pomelo, which gives them sweet fruit.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;mandarin orange&quot; is a calque of Swedish &quot;mandarin apelsin&quot; [&quot;apelsin&quot; from German &quot;Apfelsine&quot; (&quot;Apfel&quot; + &quot;Sina&quot;), meaning &quot;Chinese apple&quot;], first attested in the 18th century. The Imperial Chinese term &quot;mandarine&quot; was first adopted by the French for this fruit. The reason for the epithet is not clear.

&quot;Citrus reticulata&quot; is from Latin, where reticulata means &quot;netted&quot;.

== Description ==

=== Tree ===

&quot;Citrus reticulata&quot; is a moderate-sized tree some in height. The tree trunk and major branches have thorns. The leaves are shiny, green, and rather small. The petioles are short, almost wingless or slightly winged. The flowers are borne singly or in small groups in the leaf-axils. Citrus are usually self-fertile (needing only a bee to move pollen within the same flower) or parthenocarpic (not needing pollination and therefore seedless, such as the satsuma). A mature mandarin tree can yield up to of fruit.

=== Fruit ===

Mandarin orange fruits are small . Their color is orange, yellow-orange, or red-orange. The skin is thin and peels off easily. Their easiness to peel is an important advantage of mandarin oranges over other citrus fruits. Just like with other citrus fruits, mandarin is separated easily from the segments. The fruits may be seedless or contain a small number of seeds. Though the ancestral mandarin orange was bitter, most commercial mandarin strains derive from hybridization with pomelo, which gives them sweet fruit. They can be eaten as whole or squeezed to make juice. A ripe mandarin orange is firm to slightly soft, heavy for its size, and pebbly-skinned. The peel is thin and loose, with little white mesocarp, so they are easy to peel and to split into segments.

== Evolution ==

=== Origins ===

The wild mandarin is one of the pure ancestral citrus taxa; they evolved in a restricted region of South China and Vietnam.

=== Domestication ===

Mandarins appear to have been domesticated at least twice, in the north and south Nanling Mountains, derived from separate wild subspecies. Wild mandarins are still found there, including Daoxian mandarines (sometimes given the species name &quot;Citrus daoxianensis&quot;) as well as some members of the group traditionally called &#x27;Mangshan wild mandarins&#x27;, a generic grouping for the wild mandarin-like fruit of the Mangshan area that includes both true mandarins (&quot;mangshanyeju&quot;, the southern subspecies) and the genetically distinct and only distantly-related Mangshanyegan. The wild mandarins were found free of the introgressed pomelo (&quot;C. maxima&quot;) DNA found in domestic mandarins. Still, they did appear to have small amounts (~1.8%) of introgression from the ichang papeda, which grows wild in the same region.

The Nanling Mountains are home to northern and southern genetic clusters of domestic mandarins that have similar levels of sugars in the fruit compared to their wild relatives but appreciably (in some almost 90-fold) lower levels of citric acid. The clusters display different patterns of pomelo introgression, have different deduced historical population histories, and are most closely related to distinct wild mandarins, suggesting two independent domestications in the north and south. All tested domesticated cultivars belong to one of these two genetic clusters, with varieties such as Nanfengmiju, Kishu and Satsuma from the northern domestication event producing larger, redder fruit, while varieties such as Willowleaf, Dancy, Sunki, Cleopatra, King, and Ponkan belong to the smaller, yellower-fruited southern cluster.

=== Taxonomy ===

The Tanaka classification system divided domestic mandarins and similar fruit into numerous species, giving distinct names to cultivars such as willowleaf mandarins (&quot;C. deliciosa&quot;), satsumas (&quot;C. unshiu&quot;), tangerines (&quot;C. tangerina&quot;). Under the Swingle system, all these are considered to be varieties of a single species, &quot;Citrus reticulata&quot;. Hodgson represented them as several subgroups: common (&quot;C. reticulata&quot;), Satsuma, King (&quot;C. nobilis&quot;), Mediterranean (willowleaf), small-fruited (&quot;C. indica&quot;, &quot;C. tachibana&quot; and &quot;C. reshni&quot;), and mandarin hybrids. In the genomic-based species taxonomy of Ollitrault et al., only pure wild type mandarins would fall under &quot;C. reticulata&quot;, while the pomelo admixture found in the majority of mandarins would cause them to be classified as varieties of the hybrid bitter orange, &quot;C. aurantium&quot;.

Genetic analysis is consistent with continental mandarins representing a single species, varying due to hybridization. An island species, &quot;Citrus ryukyuensis&quot; that diverged 2 to 3 million years ago when cut off by rising sea levels, was found on Okinawa Island. Its hybridization with the mainland species has produced unique island cultivars in Japan and Taiwan, such as the Tachibana orange the Shekwasha, and Nanfengmiju. They have some pomelo DNA, like all domesticated mandarins. Northern and southern domesticates contain different pomelo contributions. An &#x27;acidic&#x27; group including Sunki and Cleopatra mandarins likewise contain small regions of introgressed pomelo DNA; they are too sour to eat, but are widely used as rootstock and grown for juice. Another group, including some tangerines, satsuma and king mandarins, show more pomelo contribution. Hybrid mandarins thus fall on a continuum of increasing pomelo contribution with clementines, sweet and sour oranges, and grapefruit.

== Production ==

In 2022, world production of mandarin oranges (combined with tangerines, clementines, and satsumas in reporting to FAOSTAT) was 44.2 million tonnes, led by China with 61% of the global total. Spain produced 1.8 million tonnes in 2022, with Turkey, Egypt, and Morocco as other significant producers.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===

A mandarin orange contains 85% water, 13% carbohydrates, and negligible amounts of fat and protein (table). Among micronutrients, only vitamin C is in significant content (32% of the Daily Value) in a 100-gram reference serving, with all other nutrients in low amounts.

=== Culinary ===

Mandarins have a stronger and sweeter taste than sweet oranges.
Mandarins are peeled and eaten fresh or used in salads, desserts and main dishes. Fresh mandarins are used in the production of the liqueur Mandarine Napoléon.

The peel is used fresh, whole or as zest, or dried as chenpi. It can be used as a spice for cooking, baking, drinks, or candy. Essential oil from the fresh peel may be used as a flavouring for candy, in gelatins, ice cream, chewing gum, and baked goods. It is used as a flavouring in some liqueurs.

== Cultural significance ==

In North America, mandarins are commonly purchased in 5- or 10-pound boxes, individually wrapped in soft green paper, and given in Christmas stockings. This custom goes back to the 1880s when Japanese immigrants in Canada and the United States began receiving Japanese mandarin oranges from their families back home as gifts for the New Year. The tradition spread among the non-Japanese population and eastwards across the country: each November harvest, &quot;The oranges were quickly unloaded and shipped east by rail. &#x27;Orange Trains&#x27; – trains with boxcars painted orange – alerted everyone along the way that the irresistible oranges from Japan were back again for the holidays. For many, the arrival of Japanese mandarin oranges signalled the beginning of the holiday season.&quot; Satsumas were grown in the United States from the early 1900s. Still, Japan remained a major supplier. U.S. imports of these Japanese oranges was suspended due to hostilities with Japan during World War II. While they were one of the first Japanese goods allowed for export after the end of the war, residual hostility led to the rebranding of these oranges as &quot;Mandarin&quot; oranges instead of &quot;Japanese&quot; oranges. The delivery of the first batch of mandarin oranges from Japan in the port of Vancouver is greeted with a festival that combines Santa Claus and Japanese dancers—young girls dressed in traditional kimono. Historically, the Christmas fruit sold in North America was mostly Dancys, but now it is more often a hybrid. This Japanese tradition merged with European traditions related to the Christmas stocking. Saint Nicholas is said to have put gold coins into the stockings of three poor girls so that they would be able to afford to get married. Sometimes the story is told with gold balls instead of bags of gold, and oranges became a symbolic stand-in for these gold balls, and are put in Christmas stockings in Canada. Their use as Christmas gifts probably spread from the Japanese immigrant community. Mandarin oranges are mentioned in Sinclair Ross&#x27; 1942 novel, &quot;As for Me and My House&quot;, and his 1939 short story, &quot;Cornet at Night&quot;.

<text>The Coinage Act of 1849 was an Act of the United States Congress passed during the California Gold Rush authorizing the Mint to produce two new gold coins in response to the increased gold supply: the small gold dollar and the large double eagle worth twenty dollars. The Act also defined permissible variances in gold coinage.

== Background ==

== Legislation ==
House Bill No. 746 was introduced by James Iver McKay on January 25, 1849. On February 20, 1849, the bill was reported by the United States House Committee on Ways and Means and taken up by the House for debate. The bill passed the House the same day and moved to consideration in the Senate. On March 3, 1849, the bill was reported by the United States Senate Committee on Finance and taken up by the Senate for debate. The bill passed the Senate the same day with amendments and was sent back to the House for consideration. The House agreed to the amendments and the bill was signed into law by President James K. Polk.

<doc id="191218" wikidata="Q6692978" url="?curid=191218" title="Low birth-weight paradox">
<text>The low birth-weight paradox is an apparently paradoxical observation relating to the birth weights and mortality rate of children born to tobacco smoking mothers. Low birth-weight children born to smoking mothers have a &quot;lower&quot; infant mortality rate than the low birth weight children of non-smokers. It is an example of Simpson&#x27;s paradox.

==History==
Traditionally, babies weighing less than a certain amount (which varies between countries) have been classified as having &quot;low birth weight&quot;. In a given population, low birth weight babies have a significantly higher mortality rate than others; thus, populations with a higher rate of low birth weights typically also have higher rates of child mortality than other populations.

Based on prior research, the children of smoking mothers are more likely to be of low birth weight than children of non-smoking mothers. Thus, by extension the child mortality rate should be higher among children of smoking mothers. So it is a surprising real-world observation that low birth weight babies of smoking mothers have a lower child mortality than low birth weight babies of non-smokers.

==Explanation==
At first sight these findings seemed to suggest that, at least for some babies, having a smoking mother might be beneficial to one&#x27;s health. However the paradox can be explained statistically by uncovering a &quot;lurking variable&quot; between smoking and the two key variables: birth weight and risk of mortality. Both variables are acted on independently by smoking and other adverse conditions—birth weight is lowered and the risk of mortality increases. However, each condition does not necessarily affect both variables to the same extent.

The birth weight distribution for children of smoking mothers is shifted to lower weights by their mothers&#x27; actions. Therefore, otherwise healthy babies (who would weigh more if it were not for the fact their mother smoked) are born underweight. However, they still have a lower mortality rate than children who have other, more severe, medical reasons why they are born underweight.

In short, smoking is harmful in that it contributes to low birth weight which has higher mortality than normal birth weight, but other causes of low birth weight are generally &quot;more&quot; harmful than smoking.

==Evidence==
If one corrects and adjusts for the confounding by smoking, via stratification or multivariable regression modelling to statistically control for smoking, one finds that the association between birth weight and mortality may be attenuated towards the null. Nevertheless, most epidemiological studies of birth weight and mortality have controlled for maternal smoking, and the adjusted results, although attenuated after adjusting for smoking, still indicated a significant association.

Additional support for the hypothesis that birth weight and mortality can be acted on independently came from the analysis of birth data from Colorado: compared with the birth weight distribution in the US as a whole, the distribution curve in Colorado is also shifted to lower weights. The overall child mortality of Colorado children is the same as that for US children however, and if one corrects for the lower weights as above, one finds that babies of a given (corrected) weight are just as likely to die, whether they are from Colorado or not. The likely explanation here is that the higher altitude of Colorado affects birth weight, but not mortality.

<text>The Birthday Party (originally known as The Boys Next Door) were an Australian post-punk band, active from 1977 to 1983. The group&#x27;s &quot;bleak and noisy soundscapes,&quot; which drew irreverently on blues, free jazz, and rockabilly, provided the setting for vocalist Nick Cave&#x27;s disturbing tales of violence and perversion. Their 1981 single &quot;Release the Bats&quot; was particularly influential on the emerging gothic scene. Despite limited commercial success, The Birthday Party&#x27;s influence has been far-reaching, and they have been called &quot;one of the darkest and most challenging post-punk groups to emerge in the early &#x27;80s.&quot;

In 1980, The Birthday Party moved from Melbourne to London, where they were championed by broadcaster John Peel. They subsequently released two albums: &quot;Prayers on Fire&quot; (1981) and &quot;Junkyard&quot; (1982). Disillusioned by their stay in London, the band&#x27;s sound and live shows became increasingly violent. They broke up soon after relocating to West Berlin in 1982. The creative core of The Birthday Party – singer and songwriter Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Mick Harvey, and singer, songwriter and guitarist Rowland S. Howard – later went on to acclaimed careers.

==History==
===Early years and The Boys Next Door (1973–1978)===
The nucleus of the band first met at the private boys school Caulfield Grammar School, in suburban Melbourne, in the early seventies. A rock group was formed in 1973, with Nick Cave (vocals), Mick Harvey (guitar), and Phill Calvert (drums), with other students John Cocivera, Brett Purcell and Chris Coyne (on guitar, bass and saxophone respectively). Most were also members of the school choir. The band played under various names at parties and school functions with a mixed repertoire of David Bowie, Lou Reed, Roxy Music, Alice Cooper and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, among others. Saxophonist Chris Coyne went on to join the Paul Kelly Band in the 1980s.

After their final school year in 1975 the band decided to continue as a four-piece group, with friend Tracy Pew picking up the bass. Greatly affected by the punk explosion of 1976 which saw Australian bands The Saints and Radio Birdman making their first recordings and tours, The Boys Next Door, as they were now called, began performing punk and proto-punk cover versions, such as &quot;Blitzkrieg Bop&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot;, and a few original songs. By November 1977 their set was dominated by fast original new wave material, such as &quot;Sex Crimes&quot; and &quot;Masturbation Generation&quot;.

The Boys&#x27; second guitarist, Rowland S. Howard, joined in 1978, and about this time the group&#x27;s sound changed dramatically. The addition of Howard&#x27;s guitar was a catalyst (his later use of audio feedback being a hallmark of the group) but there were other changes, as well: their sound drew upon punk, rockabilly, free jazz and blues, but defied categorization. Many songs were driven by prominent, repetitive basslines and frenetic, minimalist drumming. In producer/engineer Tony Cohen they found a collaborator sympathetic to their experimentation and their refusal to repeat themselves, and in manager Keith Glass they found an enthusiastic financial backer. Glass&#x27; label Missing Link Records released all of the early Birthday Party records.

===Name change and relocations (1978–1982)===
The Boys Next Door&#x27;s best known song, &quot;Shivers&quot;, written by Howard, and first performed and recorded by his band The Young Charlatans, was banned by radio stations because of a reference to suicide. After recordings and moderate success in Australia (including hundreds of live shows) they headed for London in 1980, changed their name to The Birthday Party and launched into a period of innovative and aggressive music-making. Some sources say the band took its new name from the Harold Pinter play &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;; others (including Ian Johnston&#x27;s Cave biography) state it was prompted by Cave misremembering, or intentionally misattributing, the name to a non-existent birthday party scene in the Dostoyevsky novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. In a 2008 interview, Rowland S. Howard gave his own recollection: &quot;The name The Birthday Party came up in conversation between Nick and myself. There&#x27;s this apocryphal story about it coming from a Dostoyevsky novel. It may have had various connotations, but what he and I spoke about was a sense of celebration and making things into more an occasion and ritual&quot;.

They resided in London, but were disillusioned with the state of the music scene, only finding like-minded groups in the Fall and the Pop Group. They took trips back to Australia and tours through Europe and the U.S. before relocating to West Berlin in 1982. Above the barely-controlled racket, Cave&#x27;s vocals ranged from desperate to simply menacing and demented. Critics have written that &quot;neither John Cale nor Alfred Hitchcock was ever this scary,&quot; and that Cave &quot;doesn&#x27;t so much sing his vocals as expel them from his gut&quot;. Though Cave drew on earlier rock and roll shriekers—especially Iggy Pop and Suicide&#x27;s Alan Vega—his singing with the Birthday Party remains powerful and distinct. His lyrics also drew on Arthur Rimbaud and Charles Baudelaire.

The single &quot;Release the Bats&quot; came out during the emergence of the gothic scene. This song about &quot;vampire sex&quot; was promoted by an advertisement with the words &quot;Dirtiness is next to antigodliness&quot;.

Their 1982 album &quot;Junkyard&quot; was inspired by American Southern Gothic imagery, dealing with extreme subjects like an evangelist&#x27;s murdered daughter.

===Final years (1982–1983)===

For The Birthday Party, things had changed. Calvert was ejected in 1982; he was reportedly &quot;unable to nail down the beats for &#x27;Dead Joe&#x27; to everyone&#x27;s satisfaction&quot;, and Harvey moved to drums. When Pew was jailed for drunk driving and petty theft early in 1982, Chris Walsh, Barry Adamson and Howard&#x27;s brother Harry replaced him for live appearances and brief studio work. Pew rejoined the band in July.

The &quot;Mutiny&quot; EP contained lyrics evoking blasphemy, words which were as dark as the gothic poems of Lautréamont. The title track portrayed a dirty heaven with rats and trash.

In 1982 a spin-off group with Lydia Lunch, Honeymoon in Red, recorded an album which was eventually released in 1987. Harvey and Cave were reportedly so unhappy with the mixing and overdubbing done after their involvement that they requested their names be withheld from its liner notes. Howard and Pew apparently had no objections to being credited by name.

A tour in January 1983 found the group return to a five-piece, with Jeffrey Wegener playing drums and Harvey returning to second guitar. Wegener did not remain with the group, however, and they returned to a four-piece soon after. Later that year, Blixa Bargeld from the German group Einstürzende Neubauten recorded a guitar part in the studio on the track &quot;Mutiny in Heaven&quot;. Tension between Cave and Howard soon came to a head, but it was Harvey who first left the group – their final tour saw Des Hefner on drums. The Birthday Party played their final show at the Crystal Ballroom in St Kilda on 9 June 1983 and disbanded not long after, due in part to the split between Cave and Howard, as well as work and drug-related exhaustion.

===Post-breakup, legacy and influence===
Several groups rose from The Birthday Party&#x27;s ashes: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds (featuring Cave, Harvey, Adamson, Bargeld and briefly Pew), Crime and the City Solution (featuring Harvey and Howard, later just Harvey) and These Immortal Souls (featuring Howard).

Pew died from injuries caused by an epileptic seizure in 1986.

On 1 September 1992, there was a brief Birthday Party reunion as Rowland S. Howard joined Nick Cave and Mick Harvey on stage at a Bad Seeds NME charity show at the Town and Country Club in London to play &quot;Wild World&quot;, &quot;Dead Joe&quot; and &quot;Nick the Stripper&quot;.

Due in part to their legendary status and to the continuing success of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Birthday Party&#x27;s back catalogue has been re-released on CD several times. Mick Harvey has overseen releases of rare or previously unissued recordings (&quot;Live&quot; and &quot;John Peel&quot; CDs).

The Birthday Party&#x27;s initial impact was on the gothic rock genre. According to &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, &quot;The Party have been indirectly held responsible for the rise of a visceral new hardcore, ranging from The Sex Gang Children, through Danse Macabre to March Violets.&quot; Rock acts that have cited The Birthday Party as an influence include My Bloody Valentine, Alex Turner, and LCD Soundsystem. In 2006, American label Three One G released &quot;Release The Bats: The Birthday Party As Heard Through The Meat Grinder Of Three One G&quot;, a compilation featuring covers by various bands, including Daughters, Melt-Banana and Cattle Decapitation.

In October 2007, Cave alone was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. During his acceptance speech, Cave took it upon himself to &#x27;induct&#x27; the Australian members of the Bad Seeds (including Harvey), plus Howard and Pew from The Birthday Party.

Rowland S. Howard died on 30 December 2009 of liver cancer. In 2012, Howard&#x27;s early songs were played live as a tribute in Melbourne: a four-piece band played consisting of Harvey, Calvert, Ron Rude and Rowland Howard&#x27;s sister Angela.

<text>Decision Earth, also referred to as Decision: Earth, was an environmental education teachers resource for junior high school students issued by Procter &amp; Gamble in 1997. It has been controversial.

==Release of &quot;Decision Earth&quot;==
Its asserted aim was assisting students to make informed consumer product choices, and to educate then in the environmental impact of their choices:

The unit focuses on the concept of consumer product life cycle analysis, an approach to assessing the environmental impacts of a product at each stage in its life from raw materials extraction through disposal. Using this approach, a product is evaluated in terms of energy consumed, atmospheric and waterborne emissions generated and solid waste created for disposal.
Procter &amp; Gamble have claimed the package builds critical thinking skills

==Criticism of &quot;Decision Earth&quot;==
It has been asserted that &quot;Decision Earth&quot; included a series of controversial claims about waste disposal, mining and forestry issues which was distributed by the Procter &amp; Gamble corporation to roughly 75,000 schools in the United States.
Procter &amp; Gamble argued in its package that disposable diapers are no worse for the environment than cloth diapers, a claim based on scientific studies funded by the company, which is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of disposable diapers. The package described garbage-fueled incineration processes where energy is recovered as &quot;thermal recycling&quot; without mentioning the toxic ash or emissions that result.

==Decision Earth package==
The materials given to teachers and students include overhead transparency masters, student worksheets, and a teacher&#x27;s guide.

<doc id="191230" wikidata="Q24034108" url="?curid=191230" title="Corporate propaganda">
<text>Corporate propaganda refers to corporations or government entities that spread specific ideology in order to shape public opinion or perceptions and promote its own interests. The more well known term, propaganda, refers to the spreading of information or ideas by someone who has an interest in changing another persons thoughts or actions. Two important early developers in this field were Harold Lasswell and Edward Bernays. Some scholars refer to propaganda terms such as public relations, marketing, and advertising as Organized Persuasive Communication (OPC). Corporations must learn how to use OPC in order to successfully target and control audiences.

== History ==
It was not until the 20th century that the term propaganda started to become more well-known. The invention of the newspaper and radio aided the public&#x27;s knowledge of this term because of its use in World War 1. Harold Lasswell was the first to define propaganda as it is thought of today. He defined it as a person or group that aims to influence the opinion or actions of another through psychological manipulations, often subconsciously.

=== Early propaganda ===
One of the initial developers in the field of Propaganda was Edward Bernays. Propaganda became more widely known during World War I when the US government hired Bernays for the Committee for Public Informations (CPI). Throughout the early portion of his career, he called himself a propagandist. While he was employed by the CPI, Bernays established the &quot;Counsel on Public Relations&quot; and established Public Relations as a stand-alone practice. He once stated in an interview, &quot;If this could be used for war, it can be used for peace,&quot; speaking about the uses of propaganda. During World War I, the term propaganda had taken on a negative connotation due to its use in Nazi Germany. In Bernay&#x27;s book &quot;Propaganda,&quot; he stated that the using the term was a crucial part of organizations that wanted to get noticed by the public. Since propaganda had negative connotations already, he wanted it separated from its original connotation so that organizations could use targeted messaging to influence American consumers. He wanted to redefine propaganda to fit in the Public Relations role. His &quot;new propaganda&quot; was to be seen as a tool to be used by corporations to shape society&#x27;s opinions and persuade consumers.
=== Propaganda in war ===
The first users of propaganda in the US was the government. President Woodrow Wilson needed a way to persuade the American people to support US involvement in World War I. The CPI recruited famous American artists, filmmakers, and writers to make pro-war products and advertisements. Newspapers and magazines printed advertisements urging that it was the American citizen&#x27;s duty to buy war bonds and stamps to support the war efforts.
=== Propaganda for products ===
After the success of the pro-war propaganda campaign, Bernays was hired by the American Tobacco Company to find a way to persuade American women to start smoking. In the 1920s men were the primary consumers of cigarettes, and the American Tobacco Company saw women as an untapped potential consumer base. The first campaign Bernays created was aimed at women&#x27;s beauty standards. He came up with the idea to advertise cigarettes as a way to lose weight. The advertisements encouraged them to pick up a cigarette instead of a fattening food. This campaign worked incredibly well, and women started smoking at home but not out in public, so Bernays created his second campaign. This time, it appealed to the feminist movement. He labeled cigarettes &quot;torches of freedom&quot; and said they promoted equality among the genders. This was a successful campaign because many women were involved in the feminist movement at the time and were eager to accept changes that put them on the same level as men.

== Corporate propaganda vs. PR ==
Not all scholars agree that propaganda can be defined as PR. Those in the field of PR see organized persuasive communication (OPC) as a non-manipulative (consensual) form of persuasion in a democratic society. While others see all propaganda, as manipulative both historically and in current societies.

The early scholars of propaganda, like Lasswell, saw the notion of organized manipulation as unavoidable, and as society progressed, more and more corporations came to rely on it. Scholars of propaganda believe it to be a manipulative type of persuasion that intends to influence a person&#x27;s opinion. They believe that those who use propaganda do not care if it is used un-consensually or deceptively.

Those who study the field of PR tend to distance themselves from the word propaganda. They believe that any form of OPC that is highly manipulative only occurs in authoritarian governments or governments that are in direct opposition to democratic societies. They do not relate PR with any form of deception, incentivization, or coercion. The negative connotation people associate the word propaganda with has been difficult to change since its initial conception in World War I. The public resistance to adopting the idea that propaganda was not always corrupt led Edward Bernays to redefine forms of propaganda to PR.

Another reason PR scholars have tried to separate themselves from propaganda is because some say that any form of persuasion is manipulation. Corporations rely on persuasion to sell an idea and a product. PR scholars believe that if all persuasion is manipulation, then consumers would unable to tell the difference between actual and untrue advertising statements.

== Ethics ==
During the period right after World War I, the press and journalists were opposed to the practice of public relations. They believed that journalists only wrote for the interest of the public and condemned public relations for writing subjective statements that only benefited the clients. Many journalists were critical of Bernays and his new public relations. They had a hard time seeing the differences between PR and press agents. Bernays believed that, at its core, PR was a moral practice that benefited all society, but he had trouble convincing others of that.

Even though Bernays felt his definition of PR was completely ethical, some scholars criticized his involvement in the field. One occurrence that Bernays was involved with that had people questioning the ethics of propaganda or PR involved the National Electric Light Association (NELA) and their parent company, General Electric (GE). In 1928. NELA implemented a propaganda campaign that discouraged the public from owning any of the electric utilities (GE). Their propaganda campaign was set in newspapers and schools. The company publicly said that the campaign was for educational purposes so that the public would be more informed about the industry. However, when the government investigated them, it was found that they were buying off schools and faculty. They were found not only to be conducting manipulative forms of propaganda but also to have gone as far as to completely block opposing viewpoints, which was directly against what Bernays said propaganda was used for. When Bernays was asked to write about this incident, he said that when a PR counsel takes on an organization, they must maintain an entirely ethical stance, and when a point of view is bought, it is no longer ethical. Though some corporations use PR manipulatively, Bernays still believed that those who use PR had an obligation to keep its use ethical.

<doc id="191233" wikidata="Q1174481" url="?curid=191233" title="David Frum">
<text>David Jeffrey Frum (; born 30 June 1960) is a Canadian-American political commentator and a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. He is a senior editor at &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as well as an MSNBC contributor. In 2003, Frum authored the first book about Bush&#x27;s presidency written by a former member of the administration. He has taken credit for the famous phrase &quot;axis of evil&quot; in Bush&#x27;s 2002 State of the Union address, and he is considered a voice in the neoconservative movement.

Frum formerly served on the board of directors of the Republican Jewish Coalition, the British think tank Policy Exchange, the anti-drug policy group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, and as vice chairman and an associate fellow of the R Street Institute. He is the son of Canadian journalist Barbara Frum.

==Early life and education==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, to a Jewish family, Frum is the son of the late Barbara Frum (née Rosberg), a well-known, Niagara Falls, New York-born journalist and broadcaster in Canada, and the late Murray Frum, a dentist, who later became a real estate developer, philanthropist, and art collector. His father&#x27;s parents migrated from Poland to Toronto in 1930. Frum&#x27;s sister, Linda Frum, was a member of the Senate of Canada. Frum also has an adopted brother, Matthew, from whom he is estranged. He is married to the writer Danielle Crittenden, the stepdaughter of former &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; editor Peter Worthington. The couple has three children. His daughter Miranda died in February 2024, age 32, from complications of a 2019 brain tumor. He is a distant cousin of economist Paul Krugman.

At age 14, Frum was a campaign volunteer for an Ontario New Democratic Party candidate Jan Dukszta for the 1975 provincial election. During the hour-long commute each way to and from the campaign office in western Toronto, he read a paperback edition of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, which his mother had given to him. &quot;My campaign colleagues jeered at the book—and by the end of the campaign, any lingering interest I might have had in the political left had vanished like yesterday&#x27;s smoke.&quot;

Frum was educated at Yale University, where he took the Directed Studies program.

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduating from Harvard Law School, Frum returned to Toronto as an associate editor of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. He was an editorial page editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; from 1989 until 1992, and then a columnist for &quot;Forbes magazine&quot; in 1992–94. In 1994–2000, he worked as a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, as a contributing editor at neoconservative opinion magazine &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, and as a columnist for Canada&#x27;s &quot;National Post&quot;. He worked also as a regular contributor for National Public Radio. In 1996, he helped organize the &quot;Winds of Change&quot; in Calgary, Alberta, an early effort to unite the Reform Party of Canada and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

===White House===
Following the 2000 election of George W. Bush, Frum was appointed to a position as a speechwriter within the White House. He would later write that when he was first offered the job by chief Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson,
While still a Canadian citizen, he was one of the few foreign nationals working within the Bush White House. He filed for naturalization and took the oath of citizenship on September 11, 2007. Frum served as special assistant to the president for economic speechwriting from January 2001 to February 2002. Conservative commentator Robert Novak described Frum as an &quot;uncompromising supporter of Israel&quot; and &quot;fervent supporter of Ariel Sharon&#x27;s policies&quot; during his time in the White House. Frum is credited by his wife with inventing the expression &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, which Bush introduced in his 2002 State of the Union address. During Frum&#x27;s time at the White House, he was described by commentator Ryan Lizza as being part of a speechwriting brain trust that brought &quot;intellectual heft&quot; and considerable policy influence to the Bush Administration.

Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Frum hosted pseudonymous Muslim apostate and critic of Islam, Ibn Warraq at an hour-and-a-half lunch at the White House.

While serving in the Bush White House and afterward, Frum strongly supported the Iraq War by furthering the conspiracy theory that Saddam Hussein was in league with the terrorist group Al-Qaeda. In later years, however, he would express regret for that endorsement, saying that it owed more to psychological and group identity factors than reasoned judgment:

&quot;It&#x27;s human nature to assess difficult questions, not on the merits, but on our feelings about the different &#x27;teams&#x27; that form around different answers. To cite a painful personal experience: During the decision-making about the Iraq war, I was powerfully swayed by the fact that the proposed invasion of Iraq was supported by those who had been most right about the Cold War—and was most bitterly opposed by those who had been wrongest about the Cold War. Yet in the end, it is not teams that matter. It is results. As Queen Victoria&#x27;s first prime minister bitterly quipped after a policy fiasco: &#x27;What wise men had promised has not happened. What the damned fools predicted has actually come to pass.&#x27;&quot;

He also later acknowledged that it remains unclear how the US &quot;could have delivered better success in Iraq&quot; in terms of replacing Saddam with a &quot;more humane and peaceful&quot; government.

Frum left the White House in February 2002. Commentator Robert Novak, appearing on CNN, claimed that Frum was dismissed because his wife had emailed friends, saying that her husband had invented the &quot;axis of evil&quot; phrase. Frum and the White House denied Novak&#x27;s allegation.

Frum opposed the nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court of the United States, on the grounds that she was insufficiently qualified for the post, as well as insufficiently conservative.

=== American Enterprise Institute ===

Shortly after leaving the White House, Frum took up a position as a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, a neoconservative think tank. During the early days of his stint there, Frum coauthored &quot;An End to Evil&quot; with Richard Perle, which presented a neoconservative view of global affairs and an apologia of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

His position lasted from 2003 until March 25, 2010, when his paid position was terminated and he declined to accept the offer of a non-paying position. Frum later stated that he was asked to leave AEI because of his vocal criticism of the Republican party&#x27;s no-holds-barred opposition to Obamacare.

===Other activities after leaving the White House===
In 2005, Frum faced a libel lawsuit filed by the Canadian chapter of the Council on American–Islamic Relations after he suggested in a column for the &quot;National Post&quot; that CAIR was sympathetic to terrorists. Frum first vowed to fight the lawsuit, but instead the paper published an editor&#x27;s note acknowledging that &quot;neither Sheema Khan nor the Council on American-Islamic Relations Canada advocates or promotes terrorism.&quot;
On October 11, 2007, Frum announced on his blog that he was joining Rudolph Giuliani&#x27;s presidential campaign as a senior foreign policy adviser.

On November 16, 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Frum would be leaving &quot;National Review&quot;, where he was a contributing editor and online blogger. Frum announced to readers of his blog that he would be starting a new political website, NewMajority.com, describing it as &quot;a group blog, featuring many different voices. Not all of them ... conservatives or Republicans.&quot; He hoped the site would &quot;create an online community that will be exciting and appealing to younger readers, a generation often repelled by today&#x27;s mainstream conservatism.&quot; The website was launched on January 19, 2009. On October 31, 2009, its title was changed to FrumForum, to avoid confusion with other political organizations that used &quot;New Majority&quot; in their names. In 2012 it was merged into The Daily Beast, where his blog continued. Citing personal reasons shortly after the deaths of his father and father-in-law, Frum suspended his blog on June 3, 2013 but resumed writing for The Daily Beast in September 2013.

Frum joined &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as a senior editor in March 2014. During the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, Frum issued a series of tweets labeling as &quot;fake&quot; a photo of two blood-covered Palestinian youths bringing their father&#x27;s body to a hospital in Khan Younis; the man had been killed in an Israeli airstrike. Frum apologized on &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. Frum was criticized by &quot;Washington Post&quot; media writer Erik Wemple and by fellow correspondent for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, James Fallows, who termed Frum&#x27;s tweets &quot;a major journalistic error.&quot;

On November 2, 2016, he announced that he had voted for Hillary Clinton for president.

On November 6, 2024, Frum announced that he had left the Republican Party following Donald Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2024 United States presidential election.

==Books and writing==
Frum&#x27;s first book, &quot;Dead Right&quot;, was released in 1994. It &quot;expressed intense dissatisfaction with supply-siders, evangelicals, and nearly all Republican politicians&quot;, according to a negative review by a Frum opponent, Robert Novak. Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the smartest book written from the inside about the American conservative movement,&quot; William F. Buckley, Jr. found it &quot;the most refreshing ideological experience in a generation,&quot; and Daniel McCarthy of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; called it &quot;a crisply written indictment of everything its author disliked about conservatism in the early &#x27;90s.&quot;

He is also the author of &quot;What&#x27;s Right&quot; (1996) and &quot;How We Got Here&quot; (2000), a history of the 1970s, which &quot;framed the 1970s in the shadow of World War II and Vietnam, suggesting, &#x27;The turmoil of the 1970s should be understood ... as the rebellion of an unmilitary people against institutions and laws formed by a century of war and the preparation for war.&#x27;&quot; Michael Barone of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; praised &quot;How We Got Here&quot;, noting that &quot;more than any other book ... it shows how we came to be the way we are.&quot; John Podhoretz described it as &quot;compulsively readable&quot; and a &quot;commanding amalgam of history, sociology and polemic.&quot;

In January 2003 Frum released &quot;The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush&quot;, the first insider account of the Bush presidency. Frum also discussed how the events of September 11, 2001 redefined the country and the president: &quot;George W. Bush was hardly the obvious man for the job. But by a very strange fate, he turned out to be, of all unlikely things, the right man.&quot; His book &quot;An End to Evil&quot; was co-written with Richard Perle. It provided a defense of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and advocated regime change in Iran and Syria. It called for a tougher policy toward North Korea, and a tougher US stance against Saudi Arabia and other Islamic nations in order to &quot;win the war on terror&quot;.

He published &quot;Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again&quot; in 2008. In 2012, his book &quot;Why Romney Lost (And What The GOP Can Do About It)&quot;, attributed Mitt Romney&#x27;s defeat in the 2012 U.S. presidential election to an economic message out of touch with the concerns of middle-class Americans and to a backward-looking cultural message. Frum&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Patriots&quot;, was published in April 2012. It is a political satire about the election and presidency of a fictional conservative American president. In 2018, Frum published &quot;Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic&quot;, about the dangers posed by the Trump presidency to American democracy. He was interviewed for the book on the New Books Network. In 2020, he published a second volume about the Trump era and its consequences, &quot;Trumpocalypse: Restoring American Democracy&quot;.

==Appearances on public radio==

Frum was a commentator for American Public Media&#x27;s &quot;Marketplace&quot; from 2007 until his final appearance on October 12, 2011. Frum has made numerous appearances on the weekly radio program &quot;Left, Right &amp; Center&quot; on KCRW, the National Public Radio affiliate in Santa Monica, California. On the KCRW program, Frum presented the conservative viewpoint.

==Political views==

Frum supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He helped write George W. Bush&#x27;s famous &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; speech to describe the governments of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Frum is a supporter of Israel. He opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s Iran nuclear deal. In 2009, Frum described his political beliefs as follows:
I&#x27;m a conservative Republican, have been all my adult life. I volunteered for the Reagan campaign in 1980. I&#x27;ve attended every Republican convention since 1988. I was president of the Federalist Society chapter at my law school, worked on the editorial page of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and wrote speeches for President Bush—not the &#x27;Read My Lips&#x27; Bush, the &#x27;Axis of Evil&#x27; Bush. I served on the Giuliani campaign in 2008 and voted for John McCain in November. I supported the Iraq War and (although I feel kind of silly about it in retrospect) the impeachment of Bill Clinton. I could go on, but you get the idea.

In 2010, Frum was involved in the formation of the centrist group No Labels as a &quot;founding leader&quot;.

In June 2011, following the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York state, Frum&#x27;s weekly column for CNN was titled &quot;I was wrong about same-sex marriage.&quot; In it he described the evolution of his opinion from a &quot;strong opponent&quot; 14 years prior; while he had feared that its introduction would cause &quot;the American family [to] become radically more unstable,&quot; he now feels that &quot;the case against same-sex marriage has been tested against reality. The case has not passed its test.&quot; In 2013, Frum was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

In a 2013 opinion column for CNN, Frum discussed the need for a &quot;Plan B On Guns&quot; because of a lack of votes in Congress for gun control legislation. Frum specifically urged the commissioning of a surgeon general&#x27;s report on firearms health effects on individual ownership (writing that &quot;such a report would surely reach the conclusion that a gun in the home greatly elevates risks of suicide, lethal accident and fatal domestic violence&quot;), and he called for Senate hearings regarding the practices of firearms manufacturers. He compared these to hearings conducted in the 1990s about tobacco companies.

In 2014, Frum accused Edward Snowden of collaboration with Vladimir Putin&#x27;s television networks.

Frum appeared on stage with Steve Bannon, Trump&#x27;s former campaign CEO and White House Chief Strategist, in the November 2, 2018 edition of the Munk Debates in Toronto, ON., where they debated the future of populism in western politics.

In 2018, he wrote, &quot;The advanced democracies have built the freest, most just, and best societies in human history. Those societies demand many improvements, for sure—incremental, practical reforms, with careful attention to unintended consequences. But not revolution. Not the burn-it-all-down fantasies of the new populists.&quot;

Frum is a proponent of immigration reform, arguing that &quot;reducing immigration, and selecting immigrants more carefully&quot; would lead to increased economic benefits and restore &quot;the feeling of belonging to one united nation, responsible for the care and flourishing of all its people&quot;.

He expressed support for Israel and its right to self-defense during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. In December 2023, Frum said that the Israeli response was &quot;inevitable&quot; and that Palestinian statehood was not the solution.

===Presidential elections===

Frum supported John McCain in the 2008 presidential election, writing &quot;I vote for John McCain&quot;. In an article for National Review Online that he posted days before the 2008 election, he gave ten reasons why he was going to vote for McCain instead of Barack Obama. Frum had previously been a vocal critic of Republican presidential candidate McCain&#x27;s choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate on the grounds that Palin was unqualified to assume the presidency. Speaking of Palin&#x27;s performance during the campaign, Frum stated, &quot;I think she has pretty thoroughly—and probably irretrievably—proven that she is not up to the job of being president of the United States.&quot; Nevertheless, he ultimately stated his support for Palin, writing &quot;But on Tuesday, I will trust that she can learn. She has governed a state—and ... it says something important that so many millions of people respond to her as somebody who incarnates their beliefs and values. At a time when the great American middle often seems to be falling further and further behind, there may be a special need for a national leader who represents and symbolizes that middle.&quot;

After the 2012 election, Frum said that Romney would have been &quot;a really good president&quot; but that he had allowed himself to be &quot;twisted into pretzels&quot; by the more extreme factions of the Republican Party who immediately abandoned him after he lost the election.

===Never Trump===
Frum stated that he voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He is identified with the Never Trump movement, Republicans who opposed the election of Donald Trump and continued to oppose Trump during his presidency. In October 2019, Frum called Trump &quot;very, very guilty&quot; of attempting to influence Ukraine to announce an investigation into Trump&#x27;s political opponent Joe Biden. During Trump&#x27;s term, Frum wrote two books criticizing Trump, his policies, and his incompetence at governing. One was &quot;Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic&quot; (2018), the other was &quot;Trumpocalypse: Restoring American Democracy&quot; (2020). In April 2022, when the Republican Party prohibited its candidates from participating in future presidential debates, Frum attributed the decision to the &quot;Trump Cinematic Universe&quot;, an involuted cartoon version of reality accessible to &quot;only those conversant with the pro-Trump right&#x27;s internal myths and legends&quot;. In April 2024, he wrote an article published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; entitled &quot;Trump Deflates&quot;, where he argued: &quot;The House vote to aid Ukraine renews hope that Ukraine can still win its war. It also showed how and why Donald Trump should lose the 2024 election.&quot;

===Criticism of the Republican Party after 2008===
In 2009, Frum denounced various anti-Obama conspiracy theories as &quot;wild accusations and the paranoid delusions coming from the fever swamps&quot;. In his blog, Frum described the Tea Party as &quot;a movement of relatively older and relatively affluent Americans whose expectations have been disrupted by the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. They are looking for an explanation of the catastrophe—and a villain to blame. They are finding it in the same place that (Michele) Bachmann and her co-religionists located it 30 years ago: a deeply hostile national government controlled by alien and suspect forces, with Barack Obama as their leader and symbol.&quot; He explained Bachmann&#x27;s political views, some of which he called &quot;paranoid&quot;: &quot;It emerges from a religious philosophy that rejects the federal government as an alien instrument of destruction, ripping apart a Christian society. Bachmann&#x27;s religiously grounded rejection of the American state finds a hearing with many more conventional conservatives radicalized by today&#x27;s hard economic times.&quot;

On August 14, 2009, on &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot;, Frum challenged certain Republican political tactics in opposing health care and other Democratic initiatives as &quot;outrageous,&quot; &quot;dangerous,&quot; and ineffective. As Congress prepared to pass the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, Frum again criticized the Republican strategy of refusing to negotiate with President Obama and congressional Democrats on health care reform, saying that it had resulted in the Republicans&#x27; &quot;most crushing legislative defeat since the 1960s&quot;. Before making this statement, Frum had been associated with the American Enterprise Institute. He resigned from the AEI a few days later. Following the temporary withdrawal of a Republican effort to repeal the ACA in 2017, Frum wrote an article in the &quot;Atlantic&quot; in which he chastised fellow Republicans and conservatives for failing to take his advice to behave with moderation and humility.

In a September 2011 article, &quot;Tablet Magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;as the Tea Party has come to dominate the GOP, Frum has been transformed in a remarkably short period of time from right-wing royalty to apostate&quot; and quoted him as saying: &quot;There&#x27;s a style and a sensibility in the Republican Party right now that I find myself removed from, [but] you can do more good for the country by working for a better Republican Party than by leaving it to the extremists. What have they done to deserve that inheritance?&quot;

Writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine in November 2011, Frum described his reaction to fellow Republicans, who had distanced themselves from him, saying, &quot;Some of my Republican friends ask if I&#x27;ve gone crazy. I say: Look in the mirror.&quot; He described the development of an &quot;alternative reality&quot; within which the party, conservative think-tanks, and right wing commentators operate from a set of lies about the economy and nonexistent threats to their traditional base of supporters. He expressed concern over the inability of moderate Republicans to criticize their conservative brethren, contrasting this to the 1960s split between moderate Ripon Republicans and conservative Goldwater Republicans, when moderates such as Michigan governor George Romney were publicly critical of the conservatives.

==Non-political views==
Frum considers himself &quot;a not especially observant Jew&quot;. Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln are among his favorite historical figures. Marcel Proust is his favorite novelist.

<doc id="191238" wikidata="Q458014" url="?curid=191238" title="Ottaviano Petrucci">
<text>Ottaviano Petrucci (Fossombrone, 18 June 1466 – Venice, 7 May 1539) was an Italian printer. His &quot;Harmonice Musices Odhecaton&quot;, a collection of chansons printed in 1501, is commonly misidentified as the first book of sheet music printed from movable type. Actually that distinction belongs to the Roman printer Ulrich Han&#x27;s &quot;Missale Romanum&quot; of 1476. Nevertheless, Petrucci&#x27;s later work was extraordinary for the complexity of his white mensural notation and the smallness of his font, and he did in fact print the first book of polyphony using movable type. He also published numerous works by the most highly regarded composers of the Renaissance, including Josquin des Prez and Antoine Brumel.

== Life ==
He was born in Fossombrone (Pesaro), and probably was educated at Urbino. Around 1490 he went to Venice to learn the art of printing, and in 1498 he petitioned the Doge for the exclusive right to print music for the next 20 years. The right was very probably granted, since no examples of printed music from other Venetian printers are known before 1520. In 1501 he produced his first book of music, 96 chansons, as the &quot;Harmonice musices odhecaton A&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;the Odhecaton&quot;), which is the earliest known example of printed polyphonic music. In the following years he continued to refine his technique, producing new editions and reprints every few months until 1509, when his activity was interrupted by the war of the League of Cambrai against Venice; he departed the city for Fossombrone, where he resumed his activities as a printer.

Fossombrone being within the papal states, Petrucci applied for a patent with the Pope for the exclusive right to print music, which was granted for several years; however the Pope rescinded the patent when Petrucci failed to produce keyboard music, granting it instead to one of Petrucci&#x27;s competitors at Rome. In 1516 papal troops ransacked Fossombrone, and Petrucci printed nothing for three years: most likely his equipment was destroyed. The competitor who took Petrucci&#x27;s printing privilege away from him in Rome, Andrea Antico, also took over his printing business in Venice in 1520. During the 1520s Petrucci seems to have made his living managing a paper mill.

In 1536 he returned to Venice at the request of the civic authorities there, and assisted them in printing Greek and Latin texts.

== Significance ==
A total of 61 music publications by Petrucci are known. By far the most fruitful period of his life for publishing music was the period between 1501 and 1509, during which he published the three volumes of chansons (the &quot;Odhecaton&quot; being the first), 16 books of masses, five books of motets, 11 anthologies of frottole and six books of music for lute. The last publication is dated 1520.

Petrucci was not the first music printer in Europe – a number of liturgical works with woodcut music were printed before 1500, with the first, the &quot;Constance Gradual,&quot; printed about 1473, and works using movable type were printed beginning with Ulrich Han&#x27;s &quot;Missale Romanum&quot; in 1476. He was, however, the first to print in quantity and the first to print polyphonic music, and the quality of his printings was outstanding.

Petrucci&#x27;s technique required three impressions; each sheet of music would be run through the presses once for the staves, once for the music, and once for the words. Petrucci was highly successful at this enterprise; his publications are quite exact and beautifully executed. However, other printers using this method sometimes offset their prints slightly, which could result in notes being printed too high or too low on the staff – and thus jarringly incorrect for performers. Petrucci&#x27;s method was soon superseded by the innovations attributed to Pierre Attaignant, who developed and popularized the single-impression method of printing in 1528.

The printing of music made possible the development of the first truly international musical style since the unification of Gregorian Chant in the 9th century. Printed music moved around Europe during the migration of Franco-Flemish composers from their home areas in the modern day Low Countries to Italy, Germany, Spain, Poland and elsewhere; the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish became an international language, with later regional variations.

<doc id="191240" wikidata="Q320286" url="?curid=191240" title="Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat">
<text>Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, 1667 – 9 April 1747 was a Scottish landowner and head of Clan Fraser of Lovat. Convicted of high treason for his role in the Jacobite rising of 1745, he was the last man in Britain to be executed by beheading.

Fraser&#x27;s family had been associated with the Jacobite cause during the late 17th century: hoping to gain support in a dispute over ownership of the Fraser lands, he remained in contact with the exiled Stuart court. During the Jacobite rising of 1715, Fraser supported the government and was accordingly granted ownership of the confiscated Lovat estate; by the late 1730s, however, he was again secretly in contact with the exiles. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, he first gave assurances of his loyalty to both sides, but ultimately supplied Fraser levies to the Jacobite Army. 

While in hiding from government troops in Lochaber following the Battle of Culloden, he was captured near Loch Morar by the Royal Navy. Brought to London, Lovat was tried for treason by his peers in the House of Lords, found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed on Tower Hill on 9 April 1747. Lord Lovat was both praised by Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair and had his future execution accurately predicted by Maighstir Iain Mac Fhearchair in the Scottish Gaelic bardic poetry of the era. Lord Lovat has also appeared in multiple works of historical fiction published since, including novels by John Buchan, Neil Munro, and Diana Gabaldon.

==Early life==

Simon was the second son of Thomas Fraser of Beaufort (1631–1699) and Lady Sybilla MacLeod (d. 1682), daughter of John Mór MacLeod, 16th Chief of Clan MacLeod. The Beaufort Frasers were Lord Lovat, hereditary chiefs of the highland Clan Fraser. Simon was tutored privately at his home near Beauly. He was a capable student, becoming fluent in English, French and Gaelic, as well as gaining a solid grounding in Latin.

Simon&#x27;s older brother, Alexander, died from wounds received fighting for the Jacobites at the victorious Battle of Killiecrankie. Simon, now his father&#x27;s heir, left home to study at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, where he was a &quot;diligent student&quot; and graduated with a Master of Arts degree in 1695.

At this point Simon was at a crossroads, owing to the poor leadership of the clan by Hugh Fraser, 9th Lord Lovat (1666–1696). Recognising the threat posed to it by the expanding power of the nearby Clan Mackenzie, as well as its ally the Atholl Murrays, Simon of Beaufort needed to ensure his father&#x27;s succession to the lordship. There were two avenues available to him to pursue this claim: the law or the army. He chose the latter. Accordingly, he went to Edinburgh and undertook to recruit three hundred men from his clan to form part of a regiment in the service of William III and Mary II. This was done more to ensure a body of well-trained soldiers under his influence than loyalty to the government. However, a suspicious Lord John Murray (brother of Hugh Fraser&#x27;s wife, Amelia Murray) was colonel of Simon&#x27;s regiment and he was only given a lieutenancy, not a salaried captainship.

In early 1696, whilst on a trip to London in the company of both Simon of Beaufort and Lord John Murray, Hugh assigned the succession of the Lovat title to the Beaufort Frasers. Hugh died that same year, and Thomas of Beaufort (Simon&#x27;s father) then took on the title of 10th Lord Lovat, but the succession was to be disputed by Lord John Murray, now the Earl of Tullibardine and the most powerful man in Scotland.

== Open violence ==

After a fierce verbal encounter in Edinburgh, when Tullibardine attempted to make Simon renounce his claim to the lordship, Simon went to Castle Dounie to negotiate with Hugh&#x27;s widow Amelia for the hand of her young daughter (also called Amelia). Tullibardine responded by removing his niece to Blair Castle, stronghold of the Murrays. It was his intention that she marry Alexander Fraser of Philorth, heir to Lord Saltoun, and who was unrelated to the Frasers of the Gàidhealtachd.

Simon responded to this by kidnapping the young Master of Saltoun when he arrived in Fraser territory in an attempt win local support for the marriage. By having a gallows built outside the window of his prison and threatening to hang him, Simon successfully dissuaded Alexander from marrying the heiress. Although this incident was characteristic of a private clan feud, Tullibardine had no intention of letting the matter rest. He declared the Frasers had risen in open rebellion against the Crown, and harried the colonel in charge of the government barracks at Fort William to proceed against Fraser.

Before the Crown could respond, however, Simon undertook an act in October 1697 which was to have dire consequences for both himself and others. &quot;If he could not have Amelia the daughter, he would have Amelia the mother&quot;. Whilst at Castle Dounie he had an Episcopal minister brought in to marry them. Her family, the most powerful in Scotland, was naturally enraged by this act of violence. He later treated it as a practical joke without legal validity; they separated in December 1697 and he married twice more before Amelia&#x27;s death on 6 May 1743, without seeking divorce.

Once Simon allowed his wife to rejoin her family at Blair Castle, the Privy Council and Court of Session issued &quot;Letters of Intercommuning&quot;, preventing people from &quot;communing&quot; with Simon, his father and any of his followers. Moreover, they could be brought in &quot;dead or alive&quot;. A military expedition of both Atholl Murray men and government troops was sent to Fraser country in February 1698 to achieve this, but they failed to capture him. Simon and his father made good their escape to the highlands, and the troops could do little but destroy Fraser property.
They were eventually cited to answer two charges: forced marriage and rape, as well as raising men in arms. In September 1698 – and still notable for their absence – Simon, his father, and twenty leading men of the clan, were convicted of the capital crime of rebellion. Eventually Simon and his father took refuge at Dunvegan Castle on Skye. This was the ancestral home to the McLeods, his mother&#x27;s family. It was here in May 1699 that the 69 year old Thomas died, still with a price on his head. Simon now assumed the title of Lord Lovat, but he was an outlaw and unable to claim his estates. Simon was obliged to bury his father at Dunvegan rather than the traditional burial place of Lovat Frasers, at Wardlaw, near Beauly. (Eventually, on securing the title, he erected a notably extravagant memorial stone at Wardlaw Mausoleum.)

Despite these tribulations, Fraser still commanded the loyalty of his clan, not least because of the Atholl Murrays&#x27; &quot;systematic attempt to ravage the properties of those Fraser gentlemen well disposed to Simon&#x27;s cause&quot;. After his return from Skye, Simon Fraser commanded about 300 armed followers and successfully ambushed some 600 Athollmen and government soldiers near Inverness. Simon was dissuaded from massacring them, but two of Tullibardine&#x27;s brothers were forced to kiss the tip of his sword. The enemy troop were then made to run the gauntlet. In this, Simon showed he was capable of fulfilling an important role of a highland chief, that of military leader.

== Royal pardon ==
Simon was facing nearly impossible odds in his attempts to gain control of the Fraser lands, and the law offered him no opportunity for recourse. Both Tullibardine and his ally, George Mackenzie, Viscount of Tarbat, had a firm control of the Edinburgh judiciary. However, he found a powerful ally in Archibald Campbell, tenth Earl (and after 1701, first Duke) of Argyll and chief of the powerful Clan Campbell. Argyll advised Simon to go to London and seek a pardon from King William, whilst informing William in a letter of the &quot;chaos and hostility&quot; caused by Tullibardine in his pursuit of Simon. Other powerful voices were to support Argyll&#x27;s opinion, and ultimately this was to sway the King, now concerned to keep the peace in Scotland whilst he fought a war in Flanders. Granted a pardon in 1700, he was at last free to assume the title of Lord Lovat in the ancestral residence at Castle Dounie. Argyll was himself elevated to a Dukedom, and his rise seemed to presage Tullibardine&#x27;s fall as well as Simon&#x27;s advancement.
This improvement in his fortunes was not to last. The business of the forced marriage and rape was unresolved (it being a matter concerning private individuals, not the Crown), and the Murrays did not relent on this charge. When he failed to appear in court in February 1701 to answer the charge of &quot;rapt and hamesucken&quot;, he was again outlawed. This was followed up a year later by more &quot;letters of intercommuning&quot; (known more dramatically as a &quot;Commission of Fire and Sword&quot;). In March 1702 William III died, and Queen Anne succeeded to the throne. She favoured Tullibardine, rather than Argyll.

A final blow was received in mid-1702 when Amelia, the 13-year-old daughter of Hugh, the 9th Lord Lovat, married Alexander Mackenzie, who took the name &#x27;Alexander Mackenzie of Fraserdale&#x27;. This supposedly made him a Fraser, and by the terms of Hugh&#x27;s marriage contract of 1685, his first born son would inherit the title and estates of Lovat. The Mackenzie takeover of Fraser lands was very close to fruition. The newly married couple moved into Castle Dounie while Simon was in London, seeking to meet the new Queen. On Argyll&#x27;s advice, Lovat left Britain and headed to a place that might offer a solution to the ongoing issue of his inheritance: the court of the exiled Stuarts, at St Germain-en-Laye in France.

== At the court of exiles ==
After 15 years of exile, the family of James II was still hoping to regain the thrones of England and Scotland. The elder James had died a few months before Simon&#x27;s arrival, but his 14-year-old son James stood ready. However, the court-in-exile was divided into two factions. One, headed by the Earl of Middleton (&quot;good tempered, affable and patient&quot;) favoured a peaceful accession by young James to the throne of England on the death of Anne. The other faction was headed by the Duke of Perth (&quot;proud and passionate&quot;) which saw an armed rising in Scotland, assisted materially by France, as the most likely way to restore the family to its former glory. Simon gravitated towards the Duke of Perth&#x27;s faction, not least because Simon&#x27;s cousin, John McLean, already belonged to it.
One major step Fraser took to advance his cause was to convert to Catholicism. The court was ostentatiously Catholic, with James&#x27; mother Mary of Modena setting the standard for piety, and Middleton had himself recently converted. Once a Catholic, Simon was also able to secure a private audience with the King of France, Louis XIV, at Versailles. Here, speaking in &quot;good French with a Scots accent&quot;, he put forward a plan for a rising by the Jacobite clans of the highlands, aided by French troops, arms and money. Later, he added flesh to these plans. About five thousand French troops would land on the east coast of Scotland, at Dundee. At the same time, five hundred men were to land on the west coast and seize Fort William or Inverlochy. Together, they would march towards Edinburgh, gathering men from the clans as they progressed. The involvement of the highlanders was &quot;the main and the novel feature&quot; of Simon&#x27;s plan. It has also been suggested by later writers that this plan would form the basis of both major Jacobite uprisings, in 1715 and 1745.

Although the Jacobite ruling council ultimately agreed to the plan, Middleton was cautious and recommended to Louis that Fraser be sent back to Scotland to obtain written proof that the highland clans would rise if French troops landed. So, after a year in France, Simon returned to Scotland in mid-1703 to lay the groundwork for an invasion and uprising which could allow him to reclaim his title and estates.

== Double dealings ==
In 1703, Fraser returned to Britain with a handful of blank commissions signed by James Francis Edward, escorted by Lord John Murray, soon to be Duke of Atholl. He first visited London, then Scotland, where he learned that while economic hardships caused considerable discontent with Queen Anne&#x27;s government, the Highland chiefs were unenthusiastic about another rising. In September, he met Anne&#x27;s representative in the Scottish parliament, James Douglas, Duke of Queensberry and shared details of the French invasion plans. He also showed him a letter from Mary of Modena, addressed to an &#x27;L. J. M.&#x27; which he suggested was Lord John Murray; these initials were probably added by Fraser himself.

Fraser&#x27;s goal was to regain the Lovat title and estates; while his brother John tried to keep his clansmen loyal and collected rents in his absence, there were signs they were beginning to accept a Mackenzie in his place. Later evidence suggests his betrayal of the Stuart cause was an attempt to implicate his political enemies Atholl and Queensbury in a Jacobite plot. In the absence of a successful rising, this would ensure his political rehabilitation by ingratiating himself with the existing government.

As the main Scottish sponsor of Union, Queensberry was happy to implicate the anti-Union Atholl and passed this onto London and provided Fraser a passport under a false name allowing him to leave the country. With rumours already circulating about Fraser&#x27;s return and calls being made for his capture, Queensbury provided him with a passport in a false name and he was obliged to return to France to explain himself.

== Imprisonment in France ==

On his return in late 1703, Lovat prepared a report to Mary of Modena summarising Jacobite support in Scotland, which actually appeared favourable for her son&#x27;s return to the throne. After an initially warm response, news of his double dealings reached Paris. King Louis XIV responded initially by sending Lovat into exile in the middle of France, at Bourges. Misjudging the extent to which he was out of favour, he used a gratuity and a pension from the French King to help pay for lavish celebrations in the city in recognition of French military successes. Louis responded by sending him to prison at Angoulême where he was to remain, unable to influence events, for the next three years. In 1707 he was moved to the town of Saumur. He was not in prison, and able to correspond and see visitors, but he was not allowed to visit Paris or Scotland.

== 1715 rebellion ==

As late as 1714, many Fraser gentry had still not accepted Alexander Mackenzie as their chief, even though he was married to the heiress and was living at Castle Dounie. A group of Fraser gentlemen sent one of their own, James Fraser of Castle Leathers, to Saumur in order to bring Simon back home. After some hesitation by Simon, they returned to Britain via Dover. He then bided his time in London in order to determine his legal status.

At this point, political events again overtook Fraser&#x27;s life. The childless Queen Anne died just before his return to Britain and was succeeded by George of Hanover. In response, a Jacobite rebellion broke out in Scotland in September 1715, led by the Earl of Mar. Seeing his opportunity for redemption, Lovat secured permission to return to Scotland and help rally the Fraser clansmen for the government.

After an arduous trip north, Fraser finally met up with his loyal clansmen outside of Inverness, which had been occupied by Jacobite troops. The Clan Mackenzie had already declared for the Stuart King in France, and several hundred Fraser men had joined them under the Earl of Seaforth. But &quot;when they heard I was in my country&quot;, he claimed, &quot;they &#x27;made a great desertion in Mar’s army. Fraser&#x27;s &quot;energy and tactical acuity&quot; certainly reinvigorated the government&#x27;s campaign in the north, and by helping ensure no reinforcements arrived, he expedited the surrender of Inverness by its Jacobite garrison on 12 November 1715.

== Restoration of the title and estates ==
For his efforts, which included securing the surrender of the Earl of Seaforth, Fraser secured a full pardon from the King in March 1716. He was now able to occupy Castle Dounie as the 11th Lord Lovat without fear of arrest or execution. Another concession by the King later that year meant that he could also claim the income from the estates, although only for the lifetime of the previous tenant, Alexander Mackenzie (now languishing in a jail in Carlisle after having risen for the Jacobites). In a further sign of his restoration to respectability, Lovat was also appointed Governor of the Castle at Inverness and given command of his own Company of Foot.

The rest of Simon&#x27;s life involved untangling the legal and financial problems he had inherited with the title, as well as fending off lawsuits from various claimants in the courts (one writer suggests he may even have enjoyed them). One notable legal dispute was with Alexander Mackenzie (who had been pardoned for his rebellion in 1715) over the income of the estates, which dragged through the courts until the 1730s. It was only then, with the payment of a crippling sum of money as compensation, that Simon stood in undisputed possession of his title and estates.

== Lovat as Clan Chief ==
Lovat had a medieval conception of the role of clan chief. He had little patience for those leading clansmen who disagreed with him, and he quarrelled furiously with men such as Alexander Fraser of Phopachy and James Fraser of Castle Leathers. His relations with lesser clansmen were marked by a paternal interest in their affairs.

Generally he had a bag of farthings for when he walked abroad the contents of which he distributed among any beggars whom he met. He would stop a man on the road; inquire how many children he had; offer him sound advice; and promise to redress his grievances if he had any.

In his own estimate, he took care his clansmen were &quot;always well-clothed and well-armed, after the Highland fashion, and not to suffer them to wear low-country clothes&quot;. In return he kept a lavish table at his (smallish) castle, with a &quot;great abundance of all kinds of meat – and drink&quot;. As a recent biographer notes, it was really a redistribution of the rent he had collected from the clansmen.

== Family ==
With Lovat&#x27;s forced marriage with Amelia Murray in 1697 conveniently being forgotten, he married Margaret Grant, the daughter of Ludovick Grant of Grant (the &quot;Highland King&quot;), in 1717. This marriage, &quot;the most successful of Lovat’s matrimonial experiences&quot;, produced three girls (Georgina, Janet, Sibyl) and two boys (Simon and Alexander). Simon, born 1726, became Master of Lovat. Margaret died in 1729 and Lovat then married the 23 year old Primrose Campbell of Mamore four years later. This produced one child, Archibald, but the marriage was not a happy one and they separated in 1738. Lady Primrose when in Edinburgh lived in a seven-storey tenement on the Royal Mile known as Lady Lovat&#x27;s Land, lying between Strichens Close and Blackfriars Wynd (later widened to create Blackfriars Street).

Lady Lovat was forced to live in seclusion at Castle Downey after his execution, but although officially stripped of her title was still broadly referred to as &quot;Lady Lovat&quot;. Archibald Fraser became a merchant in London.

== Jacobite sympathies ==

Jacobite ideology emphasised obedience to social superiors and traditional structures; in Scotland, it was particularly strong among clan leaders and Non-Juring Episcopalians. It has been suggested Lovat was &quot;always a Jacobite&quot; and his loyalty to the London government simply a means first for the recovery and then of the retention of his ancestral title and estates. The evidence suggests that like many contemporaries among the landowning gentry, Lovat&#x27;s support for both the Stuarts and their rivals depended on which one he considered more advantageous for avoiding another estate confiscation. It is therefore very hard to discern any more consistent thread than that of pure self-interest.

After the failed 1719 Rising, the government concluded the Highlands could only be governed with the co-operation of the clan chiefs or heritors. Many Jacobite exiles accepted pardons and returned home, including William Mackenzie, Earl of Seaforth, which threatened Lovat&#x27;s influence with the government.

In a memorial of 1724, he emphasised the role of the Independent Highland Companies in controlling the Highlands; these had been disbanded in 1717, depriving him of an important source of both power and income. George Wade was sent to Scotland in 1724 to assess these proposals and approved the establishment of six new Independent Companies, one commanded by Lovat. Wade also recommended building new fortresses, linked by an extensive military road network; in 1725, he was appointed Commander in Chief, Scotland tasked with carrying out his own recommendations. These developments threatened to undercut the influence of the traditional Highland chiefs and were far less welcome.
In the early 1730s, Lovat fell out with his Whig allies, including Argyll and Duncan Forbes. By 1737, Lord Lovat had retained Iain Ruadh Stùibhart as his main intermediary and had resumed contact with the House of Stuart government in exile at the Palazzo Muti in Rome. During an extended visit by Stùibhart to Beaufort Castle in 1736, according to later trial testimony, Iain Ruadh and Lord Lovat, &quot;diverted themselves composing burlesque verse (in Gaelic) that when young Charles comes over, there will be blood and blows.&quot; Tragically, according to literary scholar John Lorne Campbell, only Iain Ruadh Stùibhart still has extant poetry and none of the Scottish Gaelic poems composed by Lord Lovat are known to have survived.

In 1739, Prince James&#x27; offer of a dukedom was enough to gain his support for forming the Jacobite Association, with several other leading men of Scotland. Aware of these moves, in 1740 the government removed him from command of his Independent Company; for reasons best known to Lovat, he deemed this a bitter insult.

By the early 1740s, Lovat&#x27;s practice of covertly granting freedom of religion, despite his official denials, to the many Catholics among his Clansmen, began to cause severe friction with the local Presbyterties of the Church of Scotland.

According to historian Odo Blundell, &quot;When writing of Strathglass on a previous occasion, I mentioned that, &#x27;from the Reformation to the beginning of the [19th-]century, the Catholics in the Aird and in Strathglass received no more support from the two chief families of the neighbourhood, namely, the Frasers and the Chisholms, than was to be expected from the heads of clans who looked upon all their clansmen, whatever might be their religion, as members of their own family.&quot;

Until their overwhelming success caused a government crackdown to be launched at the demands of the General Assembly of the Established Church, the Catholics of Clan Fraser continued to be served with Lord Lovat&#x27;s secret collusion by three outlawed Jesuit &quot;heather priests&quot;, Frs. Charles and John Farquharson and Alexander Cameron, who lived even during the winters in a mountain cave and summer shieling afterwards referred to as (, lit. &quot;the hollow of the hard-life&quot;), and which was located underneath the cliff of a big boulder at Brae of Craskie, near Beauly () in Glen Cannich (). The entrance to the cave, according to historian John Watts, was so well hidden that the three priests successfully eluded, &quot;all attempts of the local garrison to find them.&quot;

On 1 May 1744, the presbytery of Inverness resolved that something had to be done urgently about, &quot;the great growth of Popery in the country of Strathglass where Allexr. Cameron and John Farquharson, Popish priests, have been trafficking for considerable time past and have their constant residence and their public Mass-houses&quot;. An appeal was made to the General Assembly, &quot;that the Assembly may fall on effective methods to stop this contagion and particularly that they appoint a committee of their number to represent this matter to the Lord Justices Clerk, that the law may be put into execution against these priests, and proper orders given for demolishing these Mass-houses&quot;. The Presbytery further reported that the chief of Clan Chisholm had recently, &quot;promised to protect the officers of the law in demolishing the Mass-houses in his ground, and the Presbytery expect the same of the Lord Lovat, his Lordship having written to this Presbytery, that he would, what in him lay, discourage priests and Popery in his bounds.&quot;
At this time, Fr John Farquharson&#x27;s clerk, Alexander Chisholm (), was arrested and imprisoned inside &quot;The Red Dungeon&quot; at Beauly Castle by Lord Lovat. The pretext used was that the clerk was allegedly fly fishing for Atlantic salmon without permission in the River Glass near the Mass house which stood beside the modern bridge at Fasnakyle. Lord Lovat, despite being covertly a Catholic himself, refused an in-person request for the release of his clerk, so Farquharson, who was not a native speaker of the language, composed a satirical Gaelic poem. In addition to reviling Lovat for disloyalty to the Holy See and the persecution of his Catholic clansmen, the poem predicted, correctly, that the Fraser Chief would soon be lacking his head and despised by history as a traitor &quot;to both kings&quot;. Upon hearing the poem, which was a very accomplished literary work, recited to him during a dinner party at Eskadale, Lovat asked whether it was the work of the acclaimed local Gaelic poet, Mrs. Margaret (née MacDonnell of Ardnabie) Fraser of Guisachan, the wife of the 8th Laird of Glen Affric, until he heard the real author named. Satirical poetry and its authors have traditionally been viewed in the Gàidhealtachd with supernatural terror ever since pre-Christian times and, as Lovat did not wish to call down upon himself, &quot;any more disagreeable prophecies,&quot; he immediately ordered the clerk&#x27;s release.

Even so, Lord Lovat continued to aid the government and local Presbyterian synod&#x27;s crackdown against the three priests and the Catholics of Clan Fraser.

Following his September 1744 arrest by priest hunters from Clan Chisholm at the field known as () and the flight of his two priestly colleagues from the region, Fr. John Farquharson secretly dispatched word to his fellow Jesuits in Glengarry Country, asking them to look after the Catholic Frasers and Chisholms until his return.

== 1745 rising ==

On 23 July 1745, Charles Edward Stuart landed first at Eriskay and then at Loch nan Uamh, much to the dismay of Scots Jacobites who expected far more French Royal Army soldiers and military advisers than only the Seven Men of Moidart, as well far more weapons and money. Many of those contacted advised him to return to France, including MacDonald of Sleat, Donald Cameron of Lochiel, and Norman MacLeod, until a more opportune time. Lovat sent messages of support to both sides and maintained contact with Duncan Forbes, who hoped to ensure his neutrality; until then, there were men drilling on his green &quot;but only he knew why, and the law&#x27;s arm was restrained till he should be forced to declare his choice&quot;.

Lovat&#x27;s choices were further complicated by the fact the senior Jacobite leaders included his long-term enemies Lord George Murray and Tullibardine. After victory at Prestonpans in September, he solved this by ordering his son Simon, Master of Lovat to join the Jacobite Army. While Simon Fraser was a political Whig who allegedly considered a regime change war nonsensical, a contemporary noted his father was a &quot;very strict man&quot; with great power over his children. Acting on instructions from Lovat, on 16 October the Frasers attempted to kidnap Duncan Forbes from his home and attacked Fort Augustus in early December. Finally losing patience, Loudon arrested Lovat at Castle Dounie and took him to Inverness; but on 2 January, he escaped without difficulty and was transported by Fraser clansmen to Gorthleck House, overlooking Loch Ness.
Only some members of the Fraser regiment were present at Culloden in April 1746; like many others, the main part under the Master of Lovat returned only at daybreak, exhausted from an ill-fated overnight march and missed the battle. One of the few elements of the Jacobite centre to retire in good order, the Frasers withdrew towards Inverness, where they met the rest of their regiment.

==Aftermath of Culloden==

Charles was escorted from the battle field to Gorthleck House, where he met Lovat, who advised him to regroup in the hills. The next morning they went their separate ways; Lovat was rowed across Loch Ness but his escape was hampered by a combination of gout and arthritis which meant he had to be carried on a litter. In the aftermath of Culloden, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland realised that the British Army did not have a good map of the Scottish Highlands to locate Jacobite dissenters such as Simon Fraser, so that they could be put on trial. This led to the formation of the Ordnance Survey. During the post-Culloden search for Jacobites, John Ferguson, commander of the Royal Navy vessel &quot;Furnace&quot;, received information that Lovat was hiding on the island known as Eilean Bàn in Loch Morar, on 7 June. In response, Royal Navy crews under the command of Captain John Fergussone of and Captain Duff of portaged over nine miles of rough terrain. According to a later report by Bishop John Geddes, Lovat had gone to Eilean Bàn, which was a chapel, library, and former seminary for the illegal and underground Catholic Church in Scotland, to make his Confession to Bishop Hugh MacDonald, the Vicar Apostolic of the Highland District. Although both men and everyone else with them fled the island and into the mountains upon seeing the Royal Navy&#x27;s approach, Lovat was unable to keep up, was left behind, and was found by the sailors hiding inside a cave along the nearby Glen created by the River Meoble. Bishop MacDonald escaped and was later smuggled to France.
According to a later report of the action for the Duke of Newcastle, upon the island, &quot;They found the before-named Popish bishop&#x27;s house and chapel; which the sailors quickly gutted and demolished, merrily adorning themselves with the spoils of the chapel. In the scramble, a great many books and papers were tossed about and destroyed.&quot;

In his naval history of the Jacobite rising and its aftermath, historian John S. Gibson commented about the capture of Lord Lovat at Loch Morar, &quot;London, which, with the events of the past year, had come to abhor highlanders, could scarcely have been more elated had Charles Edward himself been caught. A small mythology was quick to grow up about the circumstances of his capture, as in the contemporary print of Fergussone and the soldiers of Guise&#x27;s bursting in on the aged peer disguised as an old woman.&quot;

Brought to London for trial, one of his stops was at St Albans, which is probably where he was sketched by William Hogarth, later popular when turned into an etching; this shows him listing points on his fingers, although what these were is uncertain.

==Trial and execution==
Lovat was held in the Tower of London while awaiting his trial for high treason. Held in March 1747 at Westminster Hall, this took seven days, the first five consisting of evidence for the prosecution given by Hugh Fraser of Dumballoch, Prince Charles&#x27; former secretary John Murray of Broughton, and Lovat&#x27;s own secretary, Robert Fraser.

On the sixth day, Lovat spoke in his own defence, but the result was a foregone conclusion, and a unanimous guilty verdict was passed by his peers in the House of Lords. He was sentenced to be executed by hanging, drawing and quartering, the standard penalty for treason. This was commuted to beheading, the last such execution in Britain.

The day of his execution, 9 April 1747, saw many spectators arrive at Tower Hill. Among his last words was a quote from Horace: &quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; (Latin: &quot;It is sweet and seemly to die for one&#x27;s country&quot;). At the last moment, an overcrowded timber stand collapsed, leaving nine spectators dead, much to Lovat&#x27;s amusement. Lord Lovat&#x27;s laughter, even as he was beheaded, is alleged to be the origin of the phrase &quot;to laugh one&#x27;s head off&quot;.

== Burial ==

The government originally agreed that Lovat could be buried at the family mausoleum at Wardlaw near Inverness. In the end, it was decided to follow standard practice for those executed on Tower Hill; Lovat and the two other Jacobite peers, Kilmarnock and Balmerino, were interred in St Peter ad Vincula, the chapel attached to the Tower of London. When it was refurbished in the 19th century, one of the coffins uncovered bore the nameplate &#x27;Lord Lovat&#x27;; his name now appears on a plaque on the wall of the chapel.

For over 250 years, family tradition claimed his body was secretly removed and interred in the mausoleum. A lead-covered coffin in the crypt bore a bronze nameplate in the name of Sir Simon Fraser, with a Latin inscription; thought to have been dictated by Lovat himself, it refers to &quot;the tyranny of the Athol and the treacherous plotting of the Mackenzies of Tarbat&quot;.

However, an analysis of the bones within the coffin carried out in 2018 by the University of Dundee showed they belonged to a young woman, not Simon Fraser. One suggestion is the coffin was prepared for Lovat, hence the nameplate, but when the government changed its mind, it was sent to Wardlaw anyway; investigations continue.

At the bottom of the plaque is an engraving of the Lovat Coat of Arms. However instead of a baron&#x27;s coronet there is a ducal one. In 1740, Lovat was created Duke of Fraser, Marquess of Beaufort, Earl of Stratherrick and Upper Tarf, Viscount of the Aird and Strathglass and Lord Lovat and Beaulieu in the Jacobite Peerage of Scotland by James Francis Edward Stuart, soi disant James III of England and VIII of Scotland.

Next to his coffin are those of his two sons, General Simon Fraser (1726–1782) and Archibald Campbell Fraser (1736–1815), Archibald&#x27;s wife Jane and two of their children Henry Emo Fraser and John George Hugh Fraser. Archibald&#x27;s children all predeceased him and by his request the estate passed to Thomas Alexander Fraser of Strichen in Aberdeenshire, from whom the current Lovat Fraser family descends.

== In popular culture ==
===Scottish Gaelic literature===
*The text of Fr. John Farquharson&#x27;s satirical Gaelic poem against Lord Lovat and the story behind it were first collected by folklorist and literary scholar Colin Chisholm of Lietry from the family oral tradition of Alexander Chisholm, the Victorian era Laird of Craskie, as well as the namesake and grandnephew of Fr Farquharson&#x27;s clerk Alexander Chisholm (). In addition to accurately predicting that Lord Lovat would soon lose his head and be despised as traitor &quot;to both kings&quot;, the Gaelic text also denounces the clan chief&#x27;s disloyalty to the Holy See, for his complicity in the recent religious persecution faced by the Catholics of Clan Fraser, and especially for making lavish promises of his loyalty to &quot;both&quot; the House of Hannover and the House of Stuart at the same time. The Gaelic text was published for the first time with an English translation in &quot;The Celtic Magazine&quot; in November 1881.
* Alasdair Mac Mhaighstir Alasdair, who served as the prince&#x27;s tutor in the Gaelic language and who is regarded, along with Sorley MacLean, as one of the two pinnacles of Scottish Gaelic literature, also composed (, &quot;An Elegy on Lord Lovat, Chief of the Frasers, after his execution in England&quot;) and which was intended to be sung to the air &quot;Hap me with thy petticoat&quot;. The Gaelic text, which, in contrast to the poem by Fr John Farquharson, eulogized Lord Lovat as an honourable Scottish clan chief and Jacobite martyr, while reviling those responsible for his execution, was also published with a parallel translation into English blank verse and scholarly footnotes in John Lorne Campbell&#x27;s groundbreaking volume &quot;Highland Songs of the Forty-Five&quot;.

===English language literature===
* Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, features as a character in John Buchan&#x27;s novel &quot;A Lost Lady of Old Years&quot; (1899), Neil Munro&#x27;s historical thriller &quot;The New Road&quot; (1914), and Andrew Drummond&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Books of the Incarceration of the Lady Grange&quot; (2016).
*He also features in Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;Dragonfly in Amber&quot;, the second novel in her &quot;Outlander&quot; series. In it, Lovat is the grandfather of Jamie Fraser. Lovat is played by Clive Russell in season 2 of the television series &quot;Outlander&quot;.

===Scottish traditional music===
*There is a piobaireachd named after him, &quot;Lord Lovat&#x27;s Lament&quot;, and a separate slow march tune by the same name.

<text>The hymenostomes are an order of ciliate protozoa. Most are free-living in freshwater, such as the commonly studied genus &quot;Tetrahymena&quot;, but some are parasitic on fish or aquatic invertebrates. Among these is the important species &quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot;, a common cause of death in aquaria and fish farms.

The hymenostomes are fairly typical members of the Oligohymenophorea. Their body cilia are mostly uniform, sometimes with a few long caudal cilia, and arise from monokinetids or from dikinetids at the anterior. The oral cilia are in general distinctly tetrahymenal, with three membranelles and a paroral membrane, which corresponds only to the middle segment of the tripartite membranes found in certain scuticociliates. Mouth formation during cell division usually begins next to a postoral kinety.

The hymenostomes were first defined by Delage &amp; Hérouard in 1896. Initially the scuticociliates and peniculids were included, then later treated as separate orders of a subclass Hymenostomatia, to which the astomes are sometimes added. More recently each of these groups tends to be treated as a separate subclass.

<text>New Romantic was an underground subculture movement that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The movement emerged from the nightclub scene in London and Birmingham at venues such as Billy&#x27;s and The Blitz. The New Romantic movement was characterised by flamboyant, eccentric fashion inspired by fashion boutiques such as Kahn and Bell in Birmingham and PX in London. Early adherents of the movement were often referred to by the press by such names as Blitz Kids, New Dandies and Romantic Rebels.

Influenced by David Bowie, Marc Bolan and Roxy Music, the New Romantics developed fashions inspired by the glam rock era coupled with the early Romantic period of the late 18th and early 19th century (from which the movement took its name). The term &quot;New Romantic&quot; is known to have been coined by musician, producer, manager and innovator Richard James Burgess. He stated that New Romantic&#x27; [...] fit the Blitz scene and Spandau Ballet, although most of the groups tried to distance themselves from it.&quot;

Though it was a fashion movement, several British music acts in the late 1970s and early 1980s adopted the style and became known to epitomise it within the press, including Steve Strange of Visage, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, A Flock of Seagulls, Classix Nouveaux and Boy George (of Culture Club). Ultravox were also often identified as New Romantics by the press, although they did not exhibit the same visual styles of the movement, despite their link to the band Visage. Japan and Adam and the Ants were also labelled as New Romantic artists by the press, although they all repudiated this and none had any direct connection to the original scene. Other aspiring bands of the era including ABC, Depeche Mode, the Human League, Soft Cell, Simple Minds, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Talk Talk have all at some point been described as being part of the New Romantic movement or as having been influenced by it, while others would consider them distinct from it. A number of these bands adopted synthesizers and helped to develop synth-pop in the early 1980s, which, combined with the distinctive New Romantic visuals, helped them first to national success in the UK, and then, via MTV, play a major part in the Second British Invasion of the US charts.

By the beginning of 1982, the original movement had largely dissipated. Although many of the artists associated with the scene continued their careers, some to enormous commercial success in the next few years, they had largely abandoned the aesthetics of the movement. There were attempts to revive the movement from the 1990s, including the short-lived Romo scene.

==Characteristics==
The New Romantic movement is sometimes characterised as a reaction to the direction in which the punk rock movement was evolving, and was heavily influenced by former glam rock stars of the 1970s such as David Bowie and Roxy Music. In terms of style, it rejected the austerity and anti-fashion stance which was becoming increasingly predominant in punk. Both sexes often dressed in androgynous clothing and wore cosmetics such as eyeliner and lipstick, partly derived from earlier punk fashions. This gender bending was particularly evident in figures such as Boy George of Culture Club, and Marilyn (Peter Robinson).

Fashion was based on varied looks inspired by historical Romantic themes, including frilly fop shirts in the style of the English Romantic period, Russian constructivism, Bonnie Prince Charlie, French Incroyables and 1930s&#x27; Cabaret, Hollywood starlets, Puritans and the Pierrot clown, with any look being possible if it was adapted to be unusual and striking. Common hairstyles included quiffs, mullets and wedges. However, soon after they began to gain mainstream attention, many bands associated with the New Romantic scene dropped the eclectic clothes and make-up in favour of sharp suits.

New Romantic looks were propagated from fashion designers Jane Kahn and Patti Bell in Birmingham and Helen Robinson&#x27;s Covent Garden shop PX, began to influence major collections and were spread, with a delay, through reviews of what was being worn in clubs via magazines including &quot;i-D&quot; and &quot;The Face&quot;. The emergence of the New Romantic movement into the mainstream coincided with Vivienne Westwood&#x27;s unveiling of her &quot;pirate collection&quot;, which was promoted by Bow Wow Wow and Adam and the Ants, who were managed by her then-partner Malcolm McLaren.

While some contemporary bands, particularly those of the predominantly Midlands-based 2 tone ska revival (the Specials, the Selecter, the Beat) who wrote lyrics addressing social issues such as unemployment and urban decay, the New Romantics adopted an escapist and aspirational stance. With its interest in design, marketing and image, the movement has been seen by some as an acceptance of Thatcherism; style commentator Peter York even suggested that it was aligned with the New Right.

==Terminology==
In its early stages, the movement was known by many names, including &quot;new dandies&quot;, &quot;new guys&quot;, &quot;romantic rebels&quot;, &quot;peacock punk&quot;, &quot;the now crowd&quot;, &quot;the futurists&quot;, &quot;the cult with no name&quot; and eventually as the &quot;Blitz Kids&quot;. As the scene moved beyond a single club, the media settled on the name New Romantics.

===Rejection===
Adam Ant always denied being a New Romantic, and reiterated this in 2001 and again in 2012. The band Japan also denied any connection with the New Romantic movement, having adopted an androgynous look incorporating make-up ever since their inception in the mid-1970s at the tail-end of the glam rock era (and were then heavily influenced by glam-punk band New York Dolls), some years before the New Romantic movement began. In an October 1981 interview, vocalist David Sylvian commented, &quot;There&#x27;s a period going past at the moment that may make us look as though we&#x27;re in fashion.&quot; In another interview, he stated &quot;I don&#x27;t like to be associated with them (New Romantics). The attitudes are so very different.&quot; Of Japan&#x27;s fashion sense, Sylvian said, &quot;For them (New Romantics), fancy dress is a costume. But ours is a way of life. We look and dress this way every day.&quot;

Similarly, the electronic duo Soft Cell also denied any connection to the New Romantic scene. In an interview published in January 1984, keyboardist Dave Ball reflected back on their first year of success (1981) and stated, &quot;At this time we were linked to the whole New Romantics thing, but we were never a part of that. It was just a trendy London club thing with Steve Strange.&quot;

Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) frontman Andy McCluskey ridiculed the movement in a 2010 interview, saying, &quot;Completely separate from electronic music or the future there was all the fucking Southern New Romantic bollocks. I mean, if we were ever called New Romantics there&#x27;d be a fight... &#x27;Am I wearing a kilt? Am I wearing enough eyeliner? Is my shirt frilly enough?&#x27; Oh, fuck off!&quot; OMD have nevertheless been categorised as New Romantics; a designation that keyboardist Paul Humphreys likens to &quot;calling a Scotsman &#x27;English&#x27;.&quot;

==History==
===Origins===
The New Romantic movement developed almost simultaneously in London and Birmingham. In London, it grew out of David Bowie and Roxy Music themed nights, run during 1978 in the nightclub Billy&#x27;s in Dean Street, London. In 1979, the growing popularity of the club forced organisers Steve Strange and Rusty Egan to relocate to a larger venue in the Blitz, a wine bar in Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, where they ran a Tuesday night &quot;Club for Heroes&quot;. Its patrons dressed as uniquely as they could in an attempt to draw the most attention.

Steve Strange worked as the club&#x27;s doorman and Egan was the DJ at the Blitz. The club became known for its exclusive door policy and strict dress code. Strange would frequently deny potential patrons admission because he felt that they were not costumed creatively or subversively enough to blend in with those inside the club. In a highly publicised incident, a drunken Mick Jagger tried to enter the club, but Strange denied him entry. The club spawned several spin-offs and there were soon clubs elsewhere in the capital and in other major British cities, including Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham.

While still at Billy&#x27;s, Strange and Egan joined Billy Currie and Midge Ure of Ultravox to form the band Visage. Before forming Culture Club, Boy George and Marilyn worked as cloakroom attendants at the Blitz. The video for David Bowie&#x27;s 1980 UK number one single &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; included appearances by Strange with three other Blitz Kids and propelled the New Romantic movement into the mainstream.

In Birmingham, the origins of the New Romantic movement lay in the opening in 1975 of the Hurst Street shop of the fashion designers Kahn and Bell, whose elaborate and theatrical designs brought together futuristic visual elements and influences as diverse as Egyptian, African and Far Eastern art, and would largely define the movement&#x27;s look. By 1977, a small scene featuring Jane Kahn and Patti Bell themselves, Martin Degville, Boy George and Patrick Lilley had emerged in pubs such as The Crown and clubs such as Romulus and Barbarella&#x27;s.

Leeds also developed an early New Romantic scene around 1979, with clubs including the Warehouse, Primos and Le Phonographique. This scene&#x27;s most notable exponent was Soft Cell, whose vocalist was the Warehouse&#x27;s DJ and cloakroom worker Marc Almond.

===Styles of music===

Many bands that emerged from the New Romantic movement became closely associated with the use of synthesizers to create rock and pop music, which has led to the widespread misconception that synth-pop and the New Romantic movement were synonymous. Synth-pop was prefigured in the 1960s and 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic art rock, disco, the &quot;Kraut rock&quot; of bands like Kraftwerk, the three albums made by Bowie with Brian Eno in his &quot;Berlin period&quot;, and Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s early albums.

After the breakthrough of Tubeway Army and Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound and they came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s. Bands that emerged from the New Romantic scene and adopted synth-pop included Duran Duran, Visage, and Spandau Ballet. According to authors Stuart Borthwick and Ron Moy, &quot;After the monochrome blacks and greys of punk/new wave, synthpop was promoted by a youth media interested in people who wanted to be pop stars, such as Boy George and Adam Ant&quot;.

Early synth-pop has been described as &quot;eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing&quot;, using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Later the introduction of dance beats made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop. Duran Duran, who emerged from the Birmingham scene, have been credited with incorporating a dance-orientated rhythm section into synth-pop to produce a catchier and warmer sound, which provided them with a series of hit singles.

While many groups associated with the New Romantic movement used synthesizers, some avoided them entirely or made limited use of them. Boy George&#x27;s band Culture Club, which formed in 1981, produced a sound that combined elements of Motown, Philly soul, reggae and lovers’ rock. Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow used the African-influenced rhythms of the &quot;Burundi beat&quot;.

===The second British invasion===

In the US, the cable music channel MTV reached the media capitals of New York City and Los Angeles in 1982. Style-conscious New Romantic synthpop acts became a major staple of MTV programming. They would be followed by many acts over the next three years, with many of them employing synthpop sounds; in fact, Duran Duran&#x27;s glossy videos symbolising the power of MTV and this Second British Invasion. The switch to a &quot;new music&quot; format in US radio stations was also significant in the success of British bands.

This 1980s invasion had been prefigured in May 1981 when Spandau Ballet, house band of London&#x27;s Blitz club, had flown to New York City to stage not only a live gig but a fashion show by the Axiom collective of designers, who included Sade Adu. These former Blitz Kids, &quot;21 in number and 21 their average age&quot; came by invitation of Jim Fouratt who hosted the event at the Underground club.

During 1983, 30% of the US record sales were from British acts. On 18 July 1983, 18 singles in the top 40, and six in the top 10, were by British artists. &quot;Newsweek&quot; ran an issue which featured Annie Lennox and Boy George on the cover of one of its issues, with the caption &quot;Britain Rocks America – Again&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; would release an &quot;England Swings&quot; issue with Boy George on the cover. In April 1984, 40 of the top 100 singles; further, in a May 1985 survey, eight of the top 10 singles were by acts of British origin.

===Decline and revivals===
Music journalist Dave Rimmer considered the Live Aid concert of July 1985 as the peak for the various acts that rose from the New Romantic scene of the early &#x27;80s, commenting that after which &quot;everyone seemed to take hubristic tumbles&quot;. Simon Reynolds also notes the &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; single in late 1984 and Live Aid in 1985 as turning points, with the acts that the movement spawned as having become decadent, with &quot;overripe arrangements and bloated videos&quot; for songs like Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; and Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;The War Song&quot;. The proliferation of acts using synthesisers had led to an anti-synth backlash, with groups including Spandau Ballet, Soft Cell and ABC incorporating more conventional influences and instruments into their sounds by 1983.

An American reaction against European synthpop and &quot;haircut bands&quot; has been seen as beginning in the mid-1980s with the rise of heartland rock and roots rock. In the UK, the arrival of indie rock bands, particularly the Smiths, has been claimed by the music press as marking the end of synth-driven new wave and the beginning of the raw guitar-based music that would come to dominate rock in the 1990s, with these bands adopting &quot;the kind of jangling guitar work that had typified new wave music&quot;, as a &quot;reaction against the opulence/corpulence of nouveau rich &#x27;new pop&#x27;&quot; and as &quot;part of the move back to guitar-driven music after the keyboard washes of the New Romantics&quot;. By the end of the 1980s, many acts had been dropped by their labels and the solo careers of many artists who had been associated with the New Romantic scene would gradually fade over time.

In the mid-1990s, the New Romantic era was the subject of nostalgia-oriented club nights — such as the Human League-inspired &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;, and &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, a Duran Duran-themed night club whose promoter told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s more of a celebration than a revival&quot;. In the same period it was also an inspiration for the Romo musical movement. It was championed by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, who featured the scene - proclaiming that it was a &quot;future pop explosion&quot; - on its front cover in 1995 and inside claiming that Britpop had been &quot;executed&quot; to make way for it, and including bands Orlando, Plastic Fantastic, Minty, Viva, Sexus, Hollywood and DexDexTer. None of the Romo acts made the British top 75 in their own right, although Orlando charted at number 65 with &quot;How Can We Hang on to a Dream&quot; as part of the &quot;Fever Pitch&quot; soundtrack EP.
After an unsuccessful &quot;Melody Maker&quot;-organised tour, most of the bands soon broke up.

==Documentaries and films==
In March 2021, Bruce Ashley&#x27;s documentary &quot;Blitzed: The 80&#x27;s Blitz Kids&#x27; Story&quot;, was shown on Sky Arts. Boy George, Rusty Egan and Marilyn all appeared in the film discussing their time at the club and about the early 1980s-era, whilst La Roux was interviewed about the cultural effects of the New Romantic movement on younger performers like herself.

Although it received less media coverage than London, the Birmingham scene, featuring the likes of Khan and Bell, is covered (to an extent) in the 2018 novel &quot;Blonde Boy, Red Lipstick&quot;. Some of the main characters from the New Romantic movement feature in the book, albeit under different names.

&quot;Tramps!&quot;, directed by Kevin Hegge, premiered in 2022.

<text>Rubén Olivares Avila (born January 14, 1947) is a Mexican former professional boxer and a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame., Olivares was a world champion multiple times, and considered by many as the greatest bantamweight champion of all time. He was very popular among Mexicans, many of whom considered him to be Mexico&#x27;s greatest fighter for a long period. He held the record for the most wins in unified title bouts in bantamweight history, at 6, a feat later surpassed by Naoya Inoue at 7. Olivares has also had both starring and cameo appearances in Mexican movies, and he participated in more than 100 professional bouts.

==Professional career==
Olivares made his pro debut at the age of 17 by knocking out Freddy García in round one at Cuernavaca. With that knockout win, a streak of 22 knockout wins in a row had been set off. During that streak, he beat Tony Gallegos, Monito Aguilar and Antonio Leal, among others. It was on March 8, 1967, that Felipe González became the first one to go the distance with Olivares, when Olivares defeated him by a decision in 10 at Mexicali. Then, on July 29 of that same year, Olivares had the first spot on his record, Germán Bastidas holding him to a ten-round draw.

He had back to back rematches with González and Bastidas, knocking González out in round six on November 19, and Bastidas in round four on January 28, 1968. Then came a step up in opponent quality, when he met former world champion Salvatore Burruni in Mexico City. Olivares knocked Burruni out in three rounds. After defeating Manuel Arnal by a disqualification in six, he set off on another knockout win streak, this one reaching 21 in a row. One of the fights in that streak was against Bernabé Fernández, in Los Angeles. Olivares won his first fight abroad that day, beating Fernández in round three. On May 23, 1969, he defeated Olympic gold medalist Takao Sakurai.

===World Bantamweight Championship===
After accumulating a record of 51-0-1, Olivares received his first world title bout when he faced world bantamweight champion Lionel Rose, who was defending his world title that day, at the Inglewood Forum. According to boxing book &quot;The Ring: Boxing In The 20th Century&quot;, the forum&#x27;s director, fearing a riot like the one that happened after Rose had beaten Chucho Castillo there might happen again, went to Olivares&#x27; locker room to express his worries, and Olivares guaranteed he wouldn&#x27;t let that happen again. Olivares became the world bantamweight champion by knocking Rose out in round five on that day, August 22 of 1969.

After beating Alan Rudkin in a title defense and a couple other fighters in non-title bouts, Olivares started his trilogy of bouts with arch-enemy and countryman Castillo. Olivares&#x27; knockout streak ended in that fight, but he won the first installment of the Olivares-Castillo rivalry after rising off the canvas to score a 15-round decision. After three more non-title wins, Olivares and Castillo met again, on October 16 of 1970. This time, Olivares suffered a cut in round one, and the fight was stopped in round 14, Castillo the winner and new world Bantamweight champion by a technical knockout. This was Olivares&#x27; first loss in his 62 fight career.

After one more win, Olivares and Castillo had their rubber match, on April 3 of 1971. Olivares was knocked down once, but he rose to regain the world Featherweight title in the last fight between him and Castillo with another 15-round decision. Then, he had six more knockouts in a row, including one in a non-title bout in Nicaragua, one in Nagoya, Japan while defending the crown in the rematch for a fight which took place in 1969, won by Olivares by TKO in the 2nd round. The rematch against Kazuyoshi Kanazawa was a brutal affair and in the 13th round Kanazawa seemed to be on the verge of stopping Olivares, having him pinned to the ropes and a corner. It appears Kanazawa emptied his &quot;tank&quot; with this last attack and before the round ended Kanazawa could hardly keep his feet, and fell clumsily after missing with an uppercut. Olivares floored Kanazawa three times in the 14th round, prompting the stoppage victory. This fight was voted as the best Japanese match of 1971. Another victory came against former champion Efren Torres, and one against Jesus Pimentel, also in round 11.

On March 19, 1972, Olivares lost the world&#x27;s Bantamweight title to another countryman, Rafael Herrera, by a knockout in round eight. After defeating Godfrey Stevens in Monterrey, he and Herrera met again, with Herrera the winner by a 10-round decision.

====Move to Featherweight====
Next for Olivares was a move up in division, and he started to campaign in the Featherweight division by defeating Walter Seeley. On June 23 of 1973, he met future champion Bobby Chacón in the first installment of another trilogy of fights. What was contested for the NABF featherweight title, ended in round nine when Olivares knocked Chacón out. In his next fight, the 78th of his career, he suffered an upset, when unknown Art Hafey knocked him out in five rounds, but then he set off on a string of three more wins in a row, including a decision over Hafey in a rematch, before fighting for the WBA&#x27;s vacant world Featherweight championship.

===WBA Featherweight Championship===
On July 9, 1974, Olivares became world Featherweight champion by beating Zenzuke Utagawa by a knockout in round seven. After two non-title wins, he met Alexis Argüello on November 23 of that year, losing the world title by a knockout in round 13. He was winning this fight before he gassed and was eventually stopped.

===WBC Featherweight Championship===
One more win, and Olivares met Chacón in the second installment of their trilogy, this time with Chacón as the WBC&#x27;s world Featherweight champion. Olivares won the fight by a knockout in round two, to become world champion for the fourth time. This time, however, he also lost the title in his first defense, beaten by Ghana&#x27;s David &quot;Poison&quot; Kotey, who became that nation&#x27;s first world boxing champion ever by winning a 15-round decision against Olivares. A seven-round knockout defeat at the hands of future world champion Danny &quot;Little Red&quot; López followed.

Olivares won two fights in 1976 and lost one, including a victory over world title challenger Fernando Cabanela of the Philippines and a loss to another world title challenger, José Cervantes, from Colombia. In 1977, Olivares and Chacón boxed the final bout of their trilogy, and this time Chacón came out the winner, by a 10-round decision. But in 1978, Olivares found what would be the beginning of his &quot;last hurrah&quot; in his 93rd bout, as he knocked out the future 2 time world Lightweight champion José Luis Ramírez in two rounds at Ciudad Obregón, and he followed that win with wins over Shig Fukuyama and Isaac Vega.

After drawing in ten rounds with Guillermo Morales on April 22, 1979, he received what would turn out to be his last world title try: On July 21 of that year, he was knocked out in 12 rounds by WBA world Featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza in Houston, for the WBA Featherweight title.

For the next eight years, he fought sporadically and with mixed success, until he was able to walk away from professional boxing in 1988.

==Professional boxing record==

==Legacy==
Until Julio César Chávez came onto the scene, Olivares was considered Mexico&#x27;s best boxer. He became a mainstream star, and had friends in the Mexican entertainment world. He frequently performed cameos in comic Mexican films. He remains a Mexican national hero.

Olivares&#x27; acting career prolonged for 12 films, including Las Glorias del Gran Puas, a 1984 film based on Olivares&#x27; life that also starred an all star Mexican cast including Sasha Montenegro, Carmen Salinas, Manuel &quot;Flaco&quot; Ibáñez, Roberto Guzman, Raul Padilla, Sergio Bustamante and Rafael Inclan among others.

He had a record of 89 wins, 13 losses and 3 draws, with 79 wins by knockout. His knockout winning streaks of 22 and 21 in a row qualify as two of the longest knockout winning streaks in the history of boxing. Similarly, his 78 knockout wins make him a member of an exclusive group of boxers to have won 50 or more fights by knockout. In 2003, &quot;The Ring&quot; placed him at number twelve in their list of the greatest punchers of all time.

Olivares is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

Olivares was voted as the #1 bantamweight (along with Carlos Zárate) of the 20th century by the Associated Press in 1999.

<text>LCFG stands for &quot;Local ConFiGuration system&quot;. Developed at the University of Edinburgh beginning around 1993, it is &quot;a system for automatically installing and managing the configuration of large numbers of computer systems. It is particularly suitable for sites with very diverse and rapidly changing configurations&quot;.

==System architecture==

Source:

* The configuration of the entire site is described in a set of source files, held on a central server. Note that one source file does not (necessarily) correspond to one machine; a source file typically describes one aspect of the overall configuration, such as &quot;parameters specific to student machines&quot;, or &quot;parameters specific to Scientific Linux machines&quot;. An individual parameter may be affected by more than one source file.
* The source files are compiled into individual profiles. One profile corresponds to one machine, and the profile contains all the configuration parameters necessary to recreate the configuration of the target machine. The profiles are published on a web server.
* When a profile changes, the corresponding client is sent a simple UDP notification. The client retrieves the profile using HTTP, and caches the parameters in a DBM file. Clients normally poll periodically for new configurations in case the notification has been missed.
* Clients periodically send a simple UDP acknowledgement to the server. These are collated to generate a web page showing status information for all the clients.
* Component scripts on the client are responsible for reading the configuration parameters and taking the appropriate actions necessary to implement the configuration; usually this involves generating configuration files from the parameters in the profile. Components are notified when a new configuration is received which involves a change to some parameter of that component. The component regenerates any necessary configuration files, and notifies any associated daemons.

<doc id="191253" wikidata="Q874405" url="?curid=191253" title="Social group">
<text>In the social sciences, a social group is defined as two or more people who interact with one another, share similar characteristics, and collectively have a sense of unity. Regardless, social groups come in a myriad of sizes and varieties. For example, a society can be viewed as a large social group. The system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group or between social groups is known as group dynamics.

== Definition ==

=== Social cohesion approach ===
A social group exhibits some degree of social cohesion and is more than a simple collection or aggregate of individuals, such as people waiting at a bus stop, or people waiting in a line. Characteristics shared by members of a group may include interests, values, representations, ethnic or social background, and kinship ties. Kinship ties being a social bond based on common ancestry, marriage or adoption. In a similar vein, some researchers consider the defining characteristic of a group as social interaction. According to Dunbar&#x27;s number, on average, people cannot maintain stable social relationships with more than 150 individuals.

Social psychologist Muzafer Sherif proposed to define a social unit as a number of individuals interacting with each other with respect to:

# Common motives and goals
# An accepted division of labor, i.e. roles
# Established status (social rank, dominance) relationships
# Accepted norms and values with reference to matters relevant to the group
# Development of accepted (praise and punishment) if and when norms were respected or violated

This definition succeeds in providing the researcher with the tools required to answer three important questions:

# &quot;How is a group formed?&quot;
# &quot;How does a group function?&quot;
# &quot;How does one describe those social interactions that occur on the way to forming a group?&quot;

==== Significance of that definition ====
The attention of those who use, participate in, or study groups has focused on functioning groups, on larger organizations, or on the decisions made in these organizations. Much less attention has been paid to the more ubiquitous and universal social behaviors that do not clearly demonstrate one or more of the five necessary elements described by Sherif.

Some of the earliest efforts to understand these social units have been the extensive descriptions of urban street gangs in the 1920s and 1930s, continuing through the 1950s, which understood them to be largely reactions to the established authority. The primary goal of gang members was to defend gang territory, and to define and maintain the dominance structure within the gang. There remains in the popular media and urban law enforcement agencies an avid interest in gangs, reflected in daily headlines which emphasize the criminal aspects of gang behavior. However, these studies and the continued interest have not improved the capacity to influence gang behavior or to reduce gang related violence.

The relevant literature on animal social behaviors, such as work on territory and dominance, has been available since the 1950s. Also, they have been largely neglected by policy makers, sociologists and anthropologists. Indeed, vast literature on organization, property, law enforcement, ownership, religion, warfare, values, conflict resolution, authority, rights, and families have grown and evolved without any reference to any analogous social behaviors in animals. This disconnect may be the result of the belief that social behavior in humankind is radically different from the social behavior in animals because of the human capacity for language use and rationality. Of course, while this is true, it is equally likely that the study of the social (group) behaviors of other animals might shed light on the evolutionary roots of social behavior in people.

Territorial and dominance behaviors in humans are so universal and commonplace that they are simply taken for granted (though sometimes admired, as in home ownership, or deplored, as in violence). But these social behaviors and interactions between human individuals play a special role in the study of groups: &quot;they are necessarily prior to the formation of groups&quot;. The psychological internalization of territorial and dominance experiences in conscious and unconscious memory are established through the formation of social identity, personal identity, body concept, or self concept. An adequately functioning individual identity is necessary before an individual can function in a division of labor (role), and hence, within a cohesive group. Coming to understand territorial and dominance behaviors may thus help to clarify the development, functioning, and productivity of groups.

=== Social identification approach ===
Explicitly contrasted against a social cohesion based definition for social groups is the social identity perspective, which draws on insights made in social identity theory. Here, rather than defining a social group based on expressions of cohesive social relationships between individuals, the social identity model assumes that &quot;psychological group membership has primarily a perceptual or cognitive basis.&quot; It posits that the necessary and sufficient condition for individuals to act as group members is &quot;awareness of a common category membership&quot; and that a social group can be &quot;usefully conceptualized as a number of individuals who have internalized the same social category membership as a component of their self concept.&quot; Stated otherwise, while the social cohesion approach expects group members to ask &quot;who am I attracted to?&quot;, the social identity perspective expects group members to simply ask &quot;who am I?&quot;

Empirical support for the social identity perspective on groups was initially drawn from work using the minimal group paradigm. For example, it has been shown that the mere act of allocating individuals to explicitly random categories is sufficient to lead individuals to act in an ingroup favouring fashion (even where no individual self-interest is possible). Also problematic for the social cohesion account is recent research showing that seemingly meaningless categorization can be an antecedent of perceptions of interdependence with fellow category members.

While the roots of this approach to social groups had its foundations in social identity theory, more concerted exploration of these ideas occurred later in the form of self-categorization theory. Whereas social identity theory was directed initially at the explanation of intergroup conflict in the absence of any conflict of interests, self-categorization theory was developed to explain how individuals come to perceive themselves as members of a group in the first place, and how this self-grouping process underlies and determines all problems subsequent aspects of group behaviour.

=== Defining characteristics ===
In his text, &quot;Group Dynamics,&quot; Forsyth (2010) discuses several common characteristics of groups that can help to define them.

==== Interaction ====
This group component varies greatly, including verbal or non-verbal communication, social loafing, networking, forming bonds, etc. Research by Bales (cite, 1950, 1999) determine that there are two main types of interactions; relationship interactions and task interactions.
# Relationship interactions: &quot;actions performed by group members that relate to or influence the emotional and interpersonal bonds within the group, including both positive actions (social support, consideration) and negative actions (criticism, conflict).&quot;
# Task interactions: &quot;actions performed by group members that pertain to the group&#x27;s projects, tasks, and goals.&quot; This involve members organizing themselves and utilizing their skills and resources to achieve something.

==== Goals ====
Most groups have a reason for their existence, be it increasing the education and knowledge, receiving emotional support, or experiencing spirituality or religion. Groups can facilitate the achievement of these goals. The circumplex model of group tasks by Joseph McGrath organizes group related tasks and goals. Groups may focus on several of these goals, or one area at a time. The model divides group goals into four main types, which are further sub-categorized
# Generating: coming up with ideas and plans to reach goals 
#* Planning Tasks
#* Creativity Tasks
# Choosing: Selecting a solution.
#* Intellective Tasks
#* Decision-making Tasks
# Negotiating: Arranging a solution to a problem.
#* Cognitive Conflict Tasks
#* Mixed Motive Task
# Executing: Act of carrying out a task.
#* Contests/Battles/Competitive Tasks
#* Performance/Psychomotor Tasks

==== Interdependence in relation ====
“The state of being dependent, to some degree, on other people, as when one&#x27;s outcomes, actions, thoughts, feelings, and experiences are determined in whole or part by others.&quot; Some groups are more interdependent than others. For example, a sports team would have a relatively high level of interdependence as compared to a group of people watching a movie at the movie theater. Also, interdependence may be mutual (flowing back and forth between members) or more linear/unilateral. For example, some group members may be more dependent on their boss than the boss is on each of the individuals.

==== Structure ====
Group structure involves the emergence or regularities, norms, roles and relations that form within a group over time. Roles involve the expected performance and conduct of people within the group depending on their status or position within the group. Norms are the ideas adopted by the group pertaining to acceptable and unacceptable conduct by members. Group structure is a very important part of a group. If people fail to meet their expectations within to groups, and fulfil their roles, they may not accept the group, or be accepted by other group members.

==== Unity ====
When viewed holistically, a group is greater than the sum of its individual parts. When people speak of groups, they speak of the group as a whole, or an entity, rather than speaking of it in terms of individuals. For example, it would be said that &quot;The &quot;band&quot; played beautifully.&quot; Several factors play a part in this image of unity, including group cohesiveness, and entitativity (appearance of cohesion by outsiders).

== Types ==

Donelson R. Forsyth distinguishes four main types of groups: primary groups, social groups, collectives, and categories.

=== Primary groups ===
Primary groups are small, long-term groups characterized by high amounts of cohesiveness, of member-identification, of face-to-face interaction, and of solidarity. Such groups may act as the principal source of socialization for individuals as primary groups may shape an individual&#x27;s attitudes, values, and social orientation.

Three sub-groups of primary groups are:

# kin (relatives)
# close friends
# neighbours

=== Social groups ===
Social groups are also small groups but are of moderate duration. These groups often form due to a common goal. In this type of group, it is possible for outgroup members (i.e., social categories of which one is not a member) to become ingroup members (i.e., social categories of which one is a member) with reasonable ease. Social groups, such as study-groups or coworkers, interact moderately over a prolonged period of time.

=== Collectives ===
In contrast, spontaneous collectives, such as bystanders or audiences of various sizes, exist only for a very brief period of time and it is very easy to become an ingroup member from an outgroup member and &quot;vice versa&quot;. Collectives may display similar actions and outlooks.

=== Categories ===
Categories consist of individuals that are similar to one another in a certain way; members of this group can be permanent ingroup members or temporary ingroup members. Examples of categories include groups with the same ethnicity, gender, religion, or nationality. This group is generally the largest type of group.

== Health ==
The social groups people are involved with in the workplace directly affect their health. No matter where they work or what the occupation is, feeling a sense of belonging in a peer group is a key to overall success. Part of this is the responsibility of the leader (manager, supervisor, etc.). If the leader helps everyone feel a sense of belonging within the group, it can help boost morale and productivity. According to Dr. Niklas Steffens &quot;Social identification contributes to both psychological and physiological health, but the health benefits are stronger for psychological health&quot;. The social relationships people have can be linked to different health conditions. Lower quantity or quality social relationships have been connected to issues such as: development of cardiovascular disease, recurrent myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, autonomic dysregulation, high blood pressure, cancer and delayed cancer recovery, and slower wound healing as well as inflammatory biomarkers and impaired immune function, factors associated with adverse health outcomes and mortality. The social relationship of marriage is the most studied of all, the marital history over the course of one&#x27;s life can form differing health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, chronic conditions, mobility limitations, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms. Social connectedness also plays a large part in overcoming certain conditions such as drug, alcohol, or substance abuse. With these types of issues, a person&#x27;s peer group play a big role in helping them stay sober. Conditions do not need to be life-threatening, one&#x27;s social group can help deal with work anxiety as well. When people are more socially connected have access to more support. Some of the health issues people have may also stem from their uncertainty about just where they stand among their colleagues. It has been shown that being well socially connected has a significant impact on a person as they age, according to a 10-year study by the MacArthur Foundation, which was published in the book &#x27;Successful Aging&#x27; the support, love, and care we feel through our social connections can help to counteract some of the health-related negatives of aging. Older people who were more active in social circles tended to be better off health-wise.

== Group membership and recruitment ==
Social groups tend to form based on certain principles of attraction, that draw individuals to affiliate with each other, eventually forming a group.

* The Proximity Principle – the tendency for individuals to develop relationships and form groups with those they are (often physically) close to. This is often referred to as ‘familiarity breeds liking’, or that we prefer things/people that we are familiar with 
* The Similarity Principle – the tendency for individuals to affiliate with or prefer individuals who share their attitudes, values, demographic characteristics, etc.
* The Complementarity Principle – the tendency for individuals to like other individuals who are dissimilar from themselves, but in a complementary manner. E.g. leaders will attract those who like being led, and those who like being led will attract leaders 
* The Reciprocity Principle – the tendency for liking to be mutual. For example, if A likes B, B is inclined to like A. Conversely, if A dislikes B, B will probably not like A (negative reciprocity)
* The Elaboration Principle – the tendency for groups to complexify over time by adding new members through their relationships with existing group members. In more formal or structured groups, prospective members may need a reference from a current group member before they can join.

Other factors also influence the formation of a group. Extroverts may seek out groups more, as they find larger and more frequent interpersonal interactions stimulating and enjoyable (more than introverts). Similarly, groups may seek out extroverts more than introverts, perhaps because they find they connect with extroverts more readily. Those higher in relationality (attentiveness to their relations with other people) are also likelier to seek out and prize group membership. Relationality has also been associated with extroversion and agreeableness. Similarly, those with a high need for affiliation are more drawn to join groups, spend more time with groups and accept other group members more readily.

Previous experiences with groups (good and bad) inform people&#x27;s decisions to join prospective groups. Individuals will compare the rewards of the group (e.g. belonging, emotional support, informational support, instrumental support, spiritual support; see Uchino, 2004 for an overview) against potential costs (e.g. time, emotional energy). Those with negative or &#x27;mixed&#x27; experiences with previous groups will likely be more deliberate in their assessment of potential groups to join, and with which groups they choose to join. (For more, see Minimax Principal, as part of Social Exchange Theory)

Once a group has begun to form, it can increase membership through a few ways. If the group is an open group, where membership boundaries are relatively permeable, group members can enter and leave the group as they see fit (often via at least one of the aforementioned Principles of Attraction). A closed group on the other hand, where membership boundaries are more rigid and closed, often engages in deliberate and/or explicit recruitment and socialization of new members.

If a group is highly cohesive, it will likely engage in processes that contribute to cohesion levels, especially when recruiting new members, who can add to a group&#x27;s cohesion, or destabilize it. Classic examples of groups with high cohesion are fraternities, sororities, gangs, and cults, which are all noted for their recruitment process, especially their initiation or hazing. In all groups, formal and informal initiations add to a group&#x27;s cohesion and strengthens the bond between the individual and group by demonstrating the exclusiveness of group membership as well as the recruit&#x27;s dedication to the group. Initiations tend to be more formal in more cohesive groups. Initiation is also important for recruitment because it can mitigate any cognitive dissonance in potential group members.

In some instances, such as cults, recruitment can also be referred to as conversion. Kelman&#x27;s Theory of Conversion identifies 3 stages of conversion: compliance (individual will comply or accept group&#x27;s views, but not necessarily agree with them), identification (member begins to mimic group&#x27;s actions, values, characteristics, etc.) and internalization (group beliefs and demands become congruent with member&#x27;s personal beliefs, goals and values). This outlines the process of how new members can become deeply connected to the group.

== Development ==
If one brings a small collection of strangers together in a restricted space and environment, provides a common goal and maybe a few ground rules, then a highly probable course of events will follow. Interaction between individuals is the basic requirement. At first, individuals will differentially interact in sets of twos or threes while seeking to interact with those with whom they share something in common: i.e., interests, skills, and cultural background. Relationships will develop some stability in these small sets, in that individuals may temporarily change from one set to another, but will return to the same pairs or trios rather consistently and resist change. Particular twosomes and threesomes will stake out their special spots within the overall space.

Again depending on the common goal, eventually twosomes and threesomes will integrate into larger sets of six or eight, with corresponding revisions of territory, dominance-ranking, and further differentiation of roles. All of this seldom takes place without some conflict or disagreement: for example, fighting over the distribution of resources, the choices of means and different subgoals, the development of what are appropriate norms, rewards and punishments. Some of these conflicts will be territorial in nature: i.e., jealousy over roles, or locations, or favored relationships. But most will be involved with struggles for status, ranging from mild protests to serious verbal conflicts and even dangerous violence.

By analogy to animal behavior, sociologists may term these behaviors &quot;territorial behaviors&quot; and &quot;dominance behaviors&quot;. Depending on the pressure of the common goal and on the various skills of individuals, differentiations of leadership, dominance, or authority will develop. Once these relationships solidify, with their defined roles, norms, and sanctions, a productive group will have been established.

Aggression is the mark of unsettled dominance order. Productive group cooperation requires that both dominance order and territorial arrangements (identity, self-concept) be settled with respect to the common goal and within the particular group. Some individuals may withdraw from interaction or be excluded from the developing group. Depending on the number of individuals in the original collection of strangers, and the number of &quot;hangers-on&quot; that are tolerated, one or more competing groups of ten or less may form, and the competition for territory and dominance will then also be manifested in the inter group transactions.

== Dispersal and transformation ==
Two or more people in interacting situations will over time develop stable territorial relationships. As described above, these may or may not develop into groups. But stable groups can also break up in to several sets of territorial relationships. There are numerous reasons for stable groups to &quot;malfunction&quot; or to disperse, but essentially this is because of loss of compliance with one or more elements of the definition of group provided by Sherif. The two most common causes of a malfunctioning group are the addition of too many individuals, and the failure of the leader to enforce a common purpose, though malfunctions may occur due to a failure of any of the other elements (i.e., confusions status or of norms).

In a society, there is a need for more people to participate in cooperative endeavors than can be accommodated by a few separate groups. The military has been the best example as to how this is done in its hierarchical array of squads, platoons, companies, battalions, regiments, and divisions. Private companies, corporations, government agencies, clubs, and so on have all developed comparable (if less formal and standardized) systems when the number of members or employees exceeds the number that can be accommodated in an effective group. Not all larger social structures require the cohesion that may be found in the small group. Consider the neighborhood, the country club, or the megachurch, which are basically territorial organizations who support large social purposes. Any such large organizations may need only islands of cohesive leadership.

For a functioning group to attempt to add new members in a casual way is a certain prescription for failure, loss of efficiency, or disorganization. The number of functioning members in a group can be reasonably flexible between five and ten, and a long-standing cohesive group may be able to tolerate a few hangers on. The key concept is that the value and success of a group is obtained by each member maintaining a distinct, functioning identity in the minds of each of the members. The cognitive limit to this span of attention in individuals is often set at seven. Rapid shifting of attention can push the limit to about ten. After ten, subgroups will inevitably start to form with the attendant loss of purpose, dominance-order, and individuality, with confusion of roles and rules. The standard classroom with twenty to forty pupils and one teacher offers a rueful example of one supposed leader juggling a number of subgroups.

Weakening of the common purpose once a group is well established can be attributed to: adding new members; unsettled conflicts of identities (i.e., territorial problems in individuals); weakening of a settled dominance-order; and weakening or failure of the leader to tend to the group. The actual loss of a leader is frequently fatal to a group, unless there was lengthy preparation for the transition. The loss of the leader tends to dissolve all dominance relationships, as well as weakening dedication to common purpose, differentiation of roles, and maintenance of norms. The most common symptoms of a troubled group are loss of efficiency, diminished participation, or weakening of purpose, as well as an increase in verbal aggression. Often, if a strong common purpose is still present, a simple reorganization with a new leader and a few new members will be sufficient to re-establish the group, which is somewhat easier than forming an entirely new group. This is the most common factor.

<text>The Caroline Islands (or the Carolines) are a widely scattered archipelago of tiny islands in the western Pacific Ocean, to the north of New Guinea. Politically, they are divided between the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in the central and eastern parts of the group, and Palau at the extreme western end. Historically, this area was also called Nuevas Filipinas or New Philippines, because they were part of the Spanish East Indies and were governed from Manila in the Philippines.

The Carolines are scattered across a distance of approximately , from the westernmost island, Tobi, in Palau, to the easternmost island, Kosrae, a state of the FSM.

==Description==
The group consists of about 500 small coral islands, east of the Philippines, in the Pacific Ocean. The distance from Yap (one of the larger Caroline islands) to Manila is .

Most of the islands are made up of low, flat coral atolls, but there are some that rise high above sea level.

== Islands of the Carolines ==
Some of the individual islands which make up the Carolines include - Yap, Truk (Chuuk), Pohnpei, Kosrae, Palau, Takatik, Satawal, Kapingamarangi, Nukuoro, Fairchuk, Namonuito, Hall Island, Nomoi Islands, Weno, Rumung, Maap, Kanifay, Ngulu, Nett, Pingelap, and Lelu.

==People and culture==

The indigenous inhabitants speak a variety of languages, including: the Micronesian languages of Pohnpeian, Chuukese, Carolinian, and Kosraean; the Western Malayo-Polynesian languages of Palauan and Chamorro; and the unclassified language Yapese (possibly one of the Admiralty Islands languages). There are also a significant number of inhabitants who belong to non-indigenous ethnic groups and speak other languages, including Filipinos and Japanese. The lingua franca used for trade and commerce among islanders who do not speak the same language is English.

The indigenous people of these islands live mainly on horticultural products, fish, many different varieties of bananas, and taro (either the &quot;swamp&quot; or the &quot;purple&quot; variety). On some islands, housing is still built using local materials such as coconut-palm thatch. As a result of missionary work over the centuries, Christianity is the religion most commonly practiced in this region of Micronesia. Many of the indigenous people adhere to the traditional belief in a supreme being called &quot;Yalafar&quot; and an evil spirit called &quot;Can.&quot; For the most part, however, they do not engage in traditional religious rites.

The inhabitants of Yap are noted for possessing an unusual currency. Besides the ordinary shell money, there is a sort of stone coinage, consisting of huge calcite or limestone discs or wheels from 6 inches to 12 feet in diameter, and weighing up to nearly 5 tons. These are all quarried in the Pelew Islands, 200 miles to the south, and must have been brought by native vessels or on rafts; later they were transferred on European vessels. The stones, which are rather tokens than money, do not circulate, but are piled up round about the chief&#x27;s treasure-house, and appear to be regarded as public property. Some may not have been seen for some years, but the transfer of wealth is facilitated by a common understanding that a stone has a new owner.

The Micronesian navigator Mau Piailug (1932–2010) was originally from the Carolinian island of Satawal. He learned the traditional navigation techniques of the Weriyeng school, which had been preserved after other traditional techniques had been forgotten (due partly to the remoteness of the Carolinian Islands). In the 1970s, Mau shared his knowledge with members of the Polynesian Voyaging Society. This led to a revival of the practices of traditional Polynesian navigation techniques, and provided anthropologists with a greater understanding of the history of the Polynesian and Micronesian peoples.

In 1985, a study was published that examined the origin of the sidereal compass used in the Caroline Islands.

==History==

Different islands in the Carolines have passed down different legends about the origins and early histories of their peoples. For example, on Pohnpei, the islanders describe their history before colonial times as divided into three eras: the &quot;Mwehin Kawa&quot; or &quot;Mwehin Aramas&quot; (era of building or peopling, before 1100); the &quot;Mwehin Sau Deleur&quot; (era of the reigns of the Saudeleur, from 1100 to around 1628); and the &quot;Mwehin Nahnmwarki&quot; (era of the tribal chiefs, from around 1628 to 1885, when Spain colonized the islands). 

According to Pohnpeian legend: the Saudeleur rulers originally came from beyond the islands; they were the first to bring government to Pohnpei; they imposed absolute, centralized rule on the islanders, which became increasingly oppressive over the centuries; and their arbitrary and onerous demands, along with their offenses against Pohnpeian deities, sowed resentment among Pohnpeians. Legend has it that the Saudeleur dynasty ended when another foreigner, called Isokelekel, invaded the islands, overthrew the Saudeleurs, and instituted the more decentralized &quot;nahnmwarki&quot; (tribal chief) system (which was maintained even during the later Colonial period, and still exists today).
=== Spanish overseas province ===

The first contact that European explorers had with the Caroline islands was in 1525, when a summer storm carried the Portuguese navigators Diogo da Rocha and Gomes de Sequeira eastward from the Moluccas (by way of Celebes). They ended up reaching several of the Caroline islands and staying there for several months, until 20 January 1526. Soon after, on 22 August 1526, the Spanish explorers Toribio Alonso de Salazar and Diego de Saavedra arrived in the area and recorded sighting the Island of San Bartolomé (Taongui). About 8 months later, on 1 January 1528, the explorer Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón claimed possession of the Ulithi Islands on behalf of the king of Spain. He named them the Islands of the Kings (; ) after his patron and the Three Wise Men honored in the approaching Catholic feast of Epiphany. Spanish explorers visited the archipelago again in 1542 (Matelotes Islands), 1543, and 1545. In 1565, the islands were briefly visited by the first governor-general of the Philippines, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi (in office from 1565 to 1572).

Europeans did not visit the island again until 1686, when Francisco de Lezcano arrived in Yap. He called the islands &quot;Las Carolinas&quot;, in honor of Charles II of Spain. This name was later extended to include the Palau Islands and the archipelagos that British explorers, visiting them a century later (between 1788 and 1799), would come to call the Gilbert Islands and the Marshall Islands (Spaniards today call the Caroline islands &quot;Islas de las Hermanas&quot;, &quot;Hombres Pintados&quot;, and &quot;Los Jardines&quot;).

A Spanish royal decree, issued on 19 October 1707, authorized Spanish missionaries to make several expeditions to the Caroline Islands. However, in 1731, one such missionary, Juan Antonio Cantova, was killed. As a result, Spain ceased relations with the Caroline Islands. When they resumed relations in 1787, their emphasis was on trade and commerce.

In 1852, a Spanish colonel named Coello suggested to the Spanish government that effective Spanish occupation of the Caroline Islands would help the Spanish engage in trade and commerce with the Philippines, Australia, New Guinea, and the Americas. His suggestion was ignored at first, but, in 1885, a Spanish government representative called Butron signed an agreement with the tribal chiefs of Koror and Artingal establishing Spanish sovereignty over the Caroline Islands. At that point, Spain attempted to impose customs duties on commercial exchanges in the region. However, Spain&#x27;s previous abandonment of the islands had allowed the establishment of German and British missions on the islands, and Germany and the United Kingdom disputed Spain&#x27;s right to collect customs revenue. The European powers called on Pope Leo XIII to arbitrate this dispute. He decided that Spain would have these rights on the islands west of the 164th meridian east, and Germany would have these rights on the Marshall Islands. (He also assigned Germany the right to maintain a naval station in one of the Caroline Islands, but Germany never exercised that right.)

After the Spanish–American War of 1898, Spain sold the Carolines and the Northern Marianas to the German Empire in the German–Spanish Treaty (1899) for 25 million pesetas (the equivalent of 17 million goldmarks or nearly one million pounds sterling), while reserving to itself the right to establish a coal mine in the area. Germany governed the archipelago as the &quot;Karolinen&quot;, and administratively associated it with German New Guinea.

===A resort for whalers===
The islands were a popular resort for whaling ships in the 19th century. The first such vessel known to have visited was the London whaler &quot;Britannia&quot;, which called at Ngatik in December 1793. Such vessels—from Britain, the United States, Australia and elsewhere—came for water, wood, and food and, sometimes, for men willing to serve as crewmen on the vessels. These ships stimulated commerce and were significant vectors for change (both good and ill). The islands most commonly visited were Kosrae, Mokil, Ngatik, Pingelap and Pohnpei.

===Japanese colony===
Japan invaded and occupied the islands in 1914 during World War I, as part of their campaign to take and occupy German colonial possessions. They installed two naval squadrons as part of this occupation. The Western Carolines were controlled by the squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Matsumura Tatsuo (1868–1932); while the Eastern Carolines were controlled by Vice-Admiral Yamaya Tanin (1866–1940). In 1920, after World War I, Japan received a League of Nations mandate to control the Caroline and Marshall Islands. During World War II, Japan operated a large base at Truk Lagoon which it used for expansion into the southeastern Pacific. In the latter years of that war, during the Japanese withdrawal to the Japanese home islands, the Allies effectively neutralized Truk in Operation Hailstone. After the war, the islands (together with the Marshall Islands) became trust territories of the United States. The Federated States of Micronesia gained independence in 1986, followed by Palau in 1994.

===Ecclesiastical history===
Two Jesuits, Juan Antonio Cantova (also known as John Anthony Cantova) and Victor Walter, attempted missionary work there in 1731; the former was soon murdered and the latter obliged to flee. Two other Jesuits were killed later. In 1767, the Jesuits were suppressed in the Spanish dominions, and for the next 120 years there was no trace of a missionary in the islands.

After the 1886 dispute between Germany and Spain over possession of the Carolines was settled by Pope Leo XIII in favour of Spain, the king of Spain directed Spanish Capuchins to go to the islands. The royal order was issued on 15 March 1886, and the &quot;Propaganda Fide&quot; officially established that mission on 15 May 1886, dividing it into two sections, named the West Caroline&#x27;s and the East Carolines. Until that time, the islands had belonged ecclesiastically to the Vicariate Apostolic of Micronesia. The Spanish Capuchins caused a catechism and prayer book to be printed in the Ponape language, and Father Anthony of Valentia wrote a small grammar and dictionary of the Yap language in 1890.

In 1899, after the Spanish priests had laid the foundations of the mission, the islands passed by purchase into the hands of Germany. Spain had contributed more than $5000 a year towards the mission, but Germany contributed no support. Spain had compelled the indigenous people to send their children to school; Germany allowed people to choose to send their children or not. As a result, many people stopped attending church and sending their children to school, and the mission&#x27;s fortunes suffered. In response, the &quot;Propaganda Fide&quot; decided on 7 November 1904 to replace the Spanish Capuchins with German missionaries, and on 18 December 1905 to erect a single Apostolic prefecture in place of the two separate missions. The Very Reverend Father Venantius of Prechtal, Germany, was appointed first prefect Apostolic at that time.

In 1906, 24 missionaries (12 Fathers and 12 Brothers) were working in thirteen stations, and several Sisters of St. Francis left Luxembourg to take charge of the ten primary schools, in which a total of 262 children were enrolled. The missionaries boasted 90 adult converts that year, and reported that there were 1900 Catholics, a few Protestants, and 11,600 inhabitants who had not converted to Christianity.

On 1 July 1905, the United States sent a Jesuit from the Manila Observatory to the island of Yap to erect a meteorological station there, and appointed the Capuchin Father Callistus as its director. The station was able to identify that the East-Asiatic typhoons were originating in the Carolines. The station still makes weather observations twice a day, and sends advance notice of severe weather to Manila.

==Postage stamps==

During the period of German control, Germany issued postage stamps for the islands.

==Transportation==

Transportation within the islands is either by boat or air (if in close proximity of an airfield).
Air travel is mostly domestic as most facilities cannot handle large aircraft. Caroline Islands Air is a chartered and the only domestic airline.

==Flora and Fauna==
Palau and Yap are the only places outside the Philippines where &quot;Callicarpa micrantha&quot; is native.

&quot;Campnosperma brevipetiolatum&quot; was first named and classified by the German botanist Georg Volkens while carrying out research on Yap. He described the species in 1901 in the article &#x27;Die Vegetation der Karolinen, mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der von Yap&#x27; in the periodical &quot;Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie&quot;(Leipzig).

&quot;Crinum bakeri&quot; is endemic to the Caroline and Marshall Islands, and was first described by Karl Moritz Schumann in 1887.

&quot;Psychotria hombroniana&quot; is endemic to the Caroline and Mariana Islands, with five subspecies being found on the Carolines, and three subspecies on the Marianas.

Three of the four species in the genus &quot;Ponapea&quot; are endemic to the Caroline Islands.

For a further list of flora found in the Carolines, see Flora of the Caroline Islands

The island of Kosrae has fifteen species of land snails endemic to the island.

<text>A region () is a self-governing local authority of Sweden. There are 21 regions (one of which is a municipality having the same responsibilities as a region), each corresponding roughly to a county. Regions are governed by a regional assembly (&quot;regionfullmäktige&quot;) that is elected every four years in conjunction with the general elections. The most important responsibilities of regions are the public health care system and public transportation. It is one of the principal administrative subdivisions of Sweden. 

Within the same geographical borders as the regions, there are county administrative boards, an administrative entity appointed by the government. As of 2010, the different regional assemblies had a combined total of 1,696 seats.

Constitutionally, the regions exercise a degree of municipal self-government provided by the Basic Laws of Sweden. This does not constitute any degree of federalism, which is consistent with Sweden&#x27;s status as a unitary state.

Within the geographic boundaries of the county there are also several smaller municipalities and administrations that exercise local self-government independent of the regions. These can also be referred to as &quot;primary municipalities&quot; or &quot;primärkommuner&quot;, while the regions are &quot;sekundärkommuner&quot;, &quot;secondary municipalities&quot;. Gotland Municipality is an exception, due to its geographical boundaries, and also has the responsibilities of a region.

Historically, Stockholm was separate from counties and was not under the jurisdiction of the Stockholm County Council until 1967, and some other large cities were in counties but outside regions. The cities handled the responsibilities. The two last such cities were Malmö and Göteborg until 1998.

In January 2020, the county councils (&quot;landsting&quot;) of Sweden were officially reclassified as regions (&quot;regioner&quot;), though the term had already &quot;de facto&quot; adopted the term well before the new law.

<doc id="191263" wikidata="Q6774600" url="?curid=191263" title="Martha Washington Hotel">
<text>The Martha Washington Hotel (later known as Hotel Thirty Thirty, Hotel Lola, King &amp; Grove New York, and The Redbury New York) was a hotel at 30 East 30th Street (later 29 East 29th Street) in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Opened in 1903 and operated as a women-only hotel for 95 years, the 13-story structure was designed by Robert W. Gibson in the Renaissance Revival style for the Women&#x27;s Hotel Company. The hotel&#x27;s namesake, Martha Washington, was the first First Lady of the United States. It is a New York City designated landmark.

The facade is largely made of brick and stone and contains classical design elements such as brackets, dentils, ornate lintels, quoins, and rustication. On both 29th and 30th Streets, the facade is divided vertically into seven bays and horizontally into a two-story base and ten-story upper section, with a recessed top floor. The hotel originally contained several amenity areas for guests on the lower two stories, including a lobby, dining rooms, reception rooms, and ballroom. Generally men were only permitted to enter the ground-level spaces and some of the second-story spaces. The upper stories originally contained 200 short-term guest rooms and 400 long-term residences, which were downsized to 250 hotel rooms by the 2020s.

The Woman&#x27;s Hotel Company was established in 1897 and sought to identify a site and raise money over the following four years. Construction began in mid-1901, and the Martha Washington Hotel opened on March 1, 1903, as both a hotel and a long-term residence. Though there was initially high demand for the Martha Washington&#x27;s rooms, the hotel&#x27;s owners struggled to raise money and leased it out beginning in 1907. The Manger family operated the Martha Washington from 1920 to 1948, and the Sillins Hotel Corporation operated the hotel from 1950 to 1997. The hotel was converted to a mixed-sex tourist hotel in 1998 and, after a renovation, was renamed the Thirty Thirty in 2000. The hotel was further renovated in 2011, 2014, 2016, and 2019, undergoing several name and ownership changes during that decade. As The Redbury New York, it saw decreased patronage during the COVID-19 pandemic and became a temporary shelter for migrants in 2023.

== Site ==
The Martha Washington Hotel is located at 27–31 East 29th Street in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The hotel occupies the center of a city block bounded by Madison Avenue to the west, 30th Street to the north, Park Avenue South to the east, and 29th Street to the south. The land lot is rectangular and measures , with frontage of on 29th and 30th Streets and a depth of . Nearby buildings include the Church of the Transfiguration, Episcopal and the James New York – NoMad to the west, the Emmet Building and 30 East 29th Street to the south, and the Colony Club building to the north. The site was assembled in 1901 from two land lots that had been occupied by the American Female Guardian Society since 1856.

== Architecture ==
The Martha Washington Hotel was designed by architect Robert W. Gibson in the Renaissance Revival style. At the time of the hotel&#x27;s construction in the early 1900s, many hotels were being built with classical architectural features because they had been designed by architects trained in Europe. Gibson, who had trained in England, incorporated classical elements such as brackets, dentils, ornate lintels, quoins, and rustication into the design.

=== Facade ===
The two primary elevations of the facade, on 29th Street to the south and 30th Street to the north, are very similar to one another. Both elevations rise twelve stories from the ground and are divided vertically into seven bays; the top stories are recessed from the street. The western elevation is partially visible and is made of plain brick with one-over-one sash windows, a recessed exterior light court, and a metal-sheathed section near the top.

==== Lower stories ====

The ground floor and second floor piano nobile of both elevations are clad in rusticated blocks of limestone. A string course runs above the ground floor on both elevations. On 30th Street, each of the ground-floor bays is separated by a pier with alternating tan brick and limestone. The entrance on 30th Street is in the center bay, and there are double-height storefronts on either side. The entry doors are made of glass and metal and are topped by a glass transom window. Two of the outer bays feature marble stoops with metal railings that ascend to the storefronts. The ground floor on 29th Street is similar in design except that the entrances are in the outermost bays. The 29th Street entrances are flanked by pairs of rusticated columns, which support a pediment with a centered cartouche and a finial.

On both elevations, the second-story piano nobile is clad with brick and contains stone quoins around the windows. The three center windows of the second story have stone balustrades at their bottoms, as well as round arches with keystones at their tops. The four outer windows on that story contain rectangular openings surrounded by terracotta key patterns. The lowest parts of the outer windows are clad with stone panels, while the upper sections are topped by lintels with splayed keystones. Above the second story are protruding balconettes with iron railings, which are supported by terracotta brackets.

==== Upper stories ====

Each window in the third through eighth stories of the northern and southern elevations has a terracotta frame. The outermost bays of the facade are clad with brick, which is arranged to resemble a rusticated facade. The center three bays feature horizontal stone courses at regular intervals, and the middle bay contains three-part windows, some of which are arranged as Palladian windows. The remaining bays have stone windowsills and are topped by lintels with key or splayed patterns. There are decorative spandrel panels above the three central third-story windows, and there are terracotta lunettes above the five central fourth-story windows.

On the ninth story of both elevations there are balconettes with iron railings in front of the outermost bays and the three center windows. All of the ninth-story windows have terracotta lintels. On the tenth story the windows are rectangular and have lintels with splayed patterns. Above the tenth-story windows are keystones with brackets, as well as terracotta corbels, above which runs a horizontal terracotta string course. The eleventh story contains a facade of terracotta panels, interspersed with windows; there is a large cornice above the eleventh story, with modillions and dentils. There are terracotta panels on the twelfth story.

=== Interior ===
When the hotel first opened it contained advanced mechanical equipment for its time, such as elevators, mail chutes, steam heating, and electric lighting. Every room had natural light exposure; the hotel did not have any interior light courts. Visitors of any sex could use the telegraph, telephone, or messenger services. There were also exterior fire escapes and stairwells. , the hotel contains about of space, spread across 13 stories.

==== Public rooms ====
When the Martha Washington Hotel was built the first and second floors were dedicated to communal rooms such as offices, a restaurant, dining rooms, and reception rooms. The lobby was decorated in an colonial style, with leather chairs and a buff-and-white color scheme. While the restaurant was open to the general public, there were dining rooms that could only be used by guests and residents. There were several shops, including a milliner/tailor shop, manicurist/podiatrist, shoe shiner, drug store, and newsstand. Next to the restaurant was a writing room and waiting room for men. Over the years, various spaces in the lobby were carved out to make way for storefronts.

Following a 2000 renovation, a bar and restaurant were created off the lobby. During a renovation in 2011, the hotel&#x27;s ground floor was gutted, the ceiling was raised, a large glazed-ebony door was installed, and the walls were redecorated with black-and-white photographs of women. After the Martha Washington was renovated again in 2014, a new meeting and event space covering was created within the hotel. The public spaces were repainted in walnut colors, with fluted columns and blue floor tiles. There was also a long hallway, with mid-century modern furniture, leading to a check-in desk. The current design of the lobby dates to a 2019 renovation, which added seating areas enclosed with stained-glass panels, as well as blue-tinted lighting and rounded mirrors. There is also a lobby lounge next to the elevators near the entrance. The hotel has a fitness center as well.

The second story had a tenant-only dining room, as well as several private reception rooms, when the hotel opened in 1903. Some of the reception rooms could be combined for major events. The second floor also had a library patterned after the one in George Washington&#x27;s estate, Mount Vernon, with a &quot;handsome&quot; fireplace and a bas relief of the United States&#x27; first First Lady, Martha Washington. The library was decorated in a deep-red color scheme and ornamented with dark wood. The parlors, music rooms, tea rooms, and other spaces were designed to fit women&#x27;s tastes. By 2016, the second floor included a ballroom covering as well as a terrace of . The roof of the hotel contained a terrace that could be converted into a &quot;summer garden and promenade&quot; with awnings and hammocks.

==== Guest rooms ====
Originally the top ten stories of the hotel comprised about 200 short-term guest rooms and 400 long-term residences, starting at the third floor. These were available in both single-room and multi-room &quot;en suite&quot; configurations. Each story held between 40 and 50 units and had a reception room. The 12th floor contained employee bedrooms, while the remainder of the 12th story and the inhabitable portions of the 13th story contained studios with skylights. By the late 1990s, the Martha Washington had been divided into either 423 or 469 rooms.

When the hotel first opened about 36 women lived on each floor, with four communal toilets and four bathtubs on each floor. There was approximately one bathroom for every four guest rooms; most units lacked &quot;en suite&quot; bathrooms. The guest rooms were arranged so they could easily be combined into suites with two to five rooms. Some apartments were outfitted with double doors, allowing businesswomen to use these spaces as showrooms. Each bedroom had furnishings such as damask coverings and large pillows, and the hotel as a whole had custom-designed furniture such as double-faced bookcases, as well as appliances such as electric alarms. Smaller rooms had sofa beds, while larger units contained standard beds.

When the Martha Washington was renovated into a co-ed tourist hotel in 2000 the rooms were rearranged. Sources disagree on whether the hotel had 370, 350, or 262 units. The rooms were small and plain in design; a &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic described the rooms as having a bed, two side tables, an armoire, and a small dressing area. Some rooms also retained vestiges of the hotel&#x27;s original use: for example, some guest rooms had sinks but not toilets or bathtubs. By 2016, there were around 255 rooms, many in different sizes and layouts. The rooms were decorated in a red, gray, black and white color scheme. with motifs relating to music and 20th-century New York City history. Each room was also equipped with mirrors, small television sets and refrigerators, and hidden speakers. Desks, nightstands, minibars, and other furniture were added in 2019, and the hotel&#x27;s 259 rooms were redecorated with gray walls.

== History ==

There was demand for women&#x27;s residences in New York City as early as the mid-19th century, when most unmarried women lived in boarding houses or at home. Among the earliest women&#x27;s residences in the city were the Working Women&#x27;s Home at 45 Elizabeth Street, developed in the 1850s, as well as a women&#x27;s hotel developed by A. T. Stewart on Park Avenue, developed in 1869. Through the 19th century, most of the city&#x27;s hotels refused to admit single women at night. Between 60,000 and 70,000 businesswomen lived in the city by 1899, when philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge estimated that 10,000 women needed a women&#x27;s hotel. When the Martha Washington Hotel was being developed in 1901, a &quot;woman prominent in sociological work&quot; said that nine out of ten working women lived apart from their families.

=== Development ===
The Woman&#x27;s Hotel Company was established in 1897 by Charles Day Kellogg, a member of the Charity Organization Society, which was created specifically to erect hotels for businesswomen. The hotel was intended as a business enterprise rather than as a philanthropic venture. The company issued a prospectus in January 1898 and appointed a board of directors, composed of two women and six men. The next month, the Woman&#x27;s Hotel Company began selling 10,000 shares at $100 each. The firm wished to build a 10- to 12-story hotel in Manhattan with 500 rooms; the company believed that the hotel could pay a 5 percent annual dividend and earn at least $150,000 per year, which could be used to fund the development of other hotels. In addition, the rooms were to be rented to &quot;self-supporting women&quot; such as artists, teachers, authors, and clerks, who were to pay between $3 and $8 a week. Although enough women expressed interest in the hotel to fill it to capacity before it opened, the Spanish–American War and slow fundraising delayed the hotel&#x27;s construction. The company wanted to raise $400,000 but had obtained only $150,000 by October 1899, which rose to $200,000 by the last week of December.

Two hundred fifty prominent New Yorkers, including William Colford Schermerhorn, John D. Rockefeller, Olivia Sage, and Helen Gould, contributed to the Women&#x27;s Hotel Company&#x27;s fundraising effort, which had raised $300,000 by the beginning of 1900. When the Women&#x27;s Hotel Company was incorporated in March 1900, a building committee was appointed to review potential sites; subscriptions had reached $350,000 by that June. The company announced in September that it had identified a site near Madison Avenue. In January 1901, it acquired the Female Guardian Society&#x27;s building at 29 East 29th Street (just east of Madison Avenue), extending through the block to 30th Street. The firm planned to begin construction in June 1901, when the society&#x27;s lease expired, and to finish the hotel by late 1902.

Robert W. Gibson was hired as the architect in April 1901, following an architectural design competition. Gibson filed plans for the hotel in June, with an estimated cost of $350,000. The Louis Weber Building Company was hired as the general contractor, while John W. Rapp received a fireproofing contract. By September, the existing structures on the hotel&#x27;s site had been demolished. At the end of 1901, the Woman&#x27;s Hotel Company announced that the hotel would be named after Martha Washington. James Case was hired as the hotel&#x27;s manager. The contracts for decorating the guestrooms were awarded to Molka Kellogg, the daughter of Charles Kellogg, along with Clara Davidge, the daughter of Episcopal bishop Henry C. Potter. All work was complete by February 5, 1903, when hotel officials planned to open the guestrooms for public inspection; the structure had cost $800,000 to complete. The formal opening was initially set for February 15.

=== Operation as women&#x27;s hotel ===

The Martha Washington Hotel opened on March 1, 1903, serving both long-term residents and short-term guests; it aimed to attract a white and middle-class clientele. At opening, there were 500 residents and 250 temporary guests, and the waiting list had 200 names. Daily fees for single rooms ranged from $1 to $2, while weekly rent for apartments was between $3 and $17. Unmarried women could rent rooms from day-to-day or for longer terms, with an average rent of $1.50 per day. Guests could also pay $6 per week for unlimited meals under what was known as the &quot;American plan&quot;. Men and married women were allowed to use the restaurant and drawing rooms on the lower stories but could not rent rooms. This policy applied even to residents&#x27; close relatives, such as brothers and fathers, as well as men invited by the residents. Also banned from the hotel were pets, babies, and any tenant who was involved in a breach of promise lawsuit, since such suits attracted publicity that the hotel&#x27;s managers did not want.

Originally, the hotel employed male bellhops and elevator operators, as the managers felt that women could not physically carry luggage. The mail clerk and the 15-member cooking team were also men, but the hotel also had waitresses and female clerks, bookkeepers, and cashiers. The hotel hired 50 waitresses and 30 chambermaids initially, although male waiters were hired in 1903. Early guests hailed from across the United States and from Europe. An article in the &quot;Star-Gazette&quot; described the Martha Washington&#x27;s clientele as including &quot;a large number of literary women&quot;, as well as students, a YWCA manager, painters, advertisers, and accountants.

==== 1900s to 1920s ====
Shortly after the Martha Washington opened, Helen Gould lent 55 paintings and 7 sculptures to the hotel for decoration. Initially, guests failed to tip the waitresses, leading to a strike in mid-1903; tipping was banned completely the next June. The Martha Washington also originally banned liquor sales, though some tenants were requesting the addition of a bar by early 1904. The novelty of an all-female clientele prompted one person to write to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, complaining about the presence of &quot;observation automobiles&quot; near the hotel. Delays in the hotel&#x27;s construction had forced the hotel&#x27;s directors to cover initial expenses using their own money; by January 1904, they reported that the hotel&#x27;s only income came from short-term guests. The Martha Washington hired its first female elevator operator in early 1904; that year, the hotel replaced the bellboys with female bellhops and fired the male waiters.

After the minimum room rate was raised to $12 per week in late 1905, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; said that &quot;the last touch of philanthropy has disappeared from the Martha Washington&quot;. The hotel was profitable by 1906, when its directors decided to discontinue the &quot;American plan&quot; meals due to low patronage. Internal disputes prompted the Martha Washington&#x27;s directors to consider leasing the hotel out during late 1906; some dissenters, including Charles Kellogg&#x27;s daughter Lucy, wanted to assume the hotel&#x27;s management. At the time, the Women&#x27;s Hotel Company had not paid a dividend in five years, and there were disagreements over expenses. In January 1907, Arthur W. Edgar{{Efn|The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; spelled his name &quot;Eager&quot;, though {{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|2012|ps=|pp=7–8}} spells it &quot;Edgar&quot;.}} leased the hotel for 10 years. Edgar agreed to pay $507,000, continue operating the hotel for women only, and rent at least 25 rooms for no more than $1 a day.

According to the 1910 United States census, residents were generally well-off with a median age of between 45 and 50. Edgar operated the hotel until his death in 1911, and George C. Brown operated the hotel for the next decade. By then, more New Yorkers had come to understand the concept of a women&#x27;s hotel. The Martha Washington switched to a staff of all-female elevator operators in 1917. A group of investors offered $800,000 for the Martha Washington in January 1920, and William and Julius Manger of the Bell Apartment Hotel Company bought the hotel the same month. The Northern Hotel Company held a long-term lease on the hotel at the time, but the company subleased the hotel to the Mangers that March. The Mangers jointly operated the Martha Washington until William&#x27;s death in 1928, upon which William&#x27;s share in the hotel was transferred to his brother and to a trust fund created for his relatives.

==== 1930s to 1960s ====
By 1930, an auditor for the Bell Securities Company, the holding corporation that owned the hotel, had said that the Martha Washington&#x27;s future was &quot;extremely limited&quot; because of decreased salaries and profits. The Boone Securities Corporation, a subsidiary of Manger Hotels, bought the hotel at an auction in 1933, bidding $10,000 and taking over a $450,000 mortgage. Later the same year, the hotel&#x27;s general manager E. J. Carroll obtained a liquor license, allowing the Martha Washington to serve wine. The issuance of the liquor license had come at the end of Prohibition, amid an increase in the number of women who wished to drink wine. Julius Manger continued to operate the Martha Washington by himself until his death in 1937. John B. Campbell, the Martha Washington&#x27;s longtime &quot;house mother&quot;, estimated in 1949 that he had served three million women during the preceding 22 years.

Julius Manger&#x27;s son, Julius Manger Jr., sold the Martha Washington and two adjoining low-rise buildings in February 1948 to a syndicate represented by Schiff, Dorfman, Stein, and Brof. The buyers quickly resold the hotel to its managing director Edward Tilson and hotelier Sol Henkind. At the time, the hotel had 445 guest units, a restaurant, and five stores, while the adjacent buildings included four apartments, three stores, and some dormitories. The Sillins Hotel Corporation, led by Robert B. Sillins, bought a controlling stake in the hotel in 1950 and continued to rent its 450 rooms to women. Sillins planned to sand-blast the facade and renovate the lobby for $200,000, and he hired the Bell Maintenance Company to renovate the entrance. The hotel&#x27;s operators took out a $100,000 mortgage loan in 1953.

Dick McCarthy and Joseph Rauti of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, opened a restaurant called the Colonnade Room at the hotel in 1961. The restaurant, seating 250 guests, contained a cocktail lounge. A nightclub called the High Life Room opened at the hotel in April 1967. The nightclub, described as looking &quot;somewhat like a Moorish courtyard&quot;, was placed within the hotel&#x27;s former ballroom.

==== 1970s to 1990s ====
By the early 1970s, the Martha Washington was one of four women&#x27;s hotels in the city, along with the Allerton Hotel for Women, Barbizon Hotel, and East End Hotel. The Martha Washington&#x27;s clientele consisted mostly of students and young professionals, and its occupancy rate averaged 80 to 90 percent. The hotel enforced a nighttime curfew, employed security guards, and banned male guests above the lobby. A limited number of men, such as residents&#x27; fathers and doctors, could enter the upper stories with supervision. Due to the ban on male visitors, women generally felt safe sleeping even with their doors unlocked. Nonetheless, there were still some reports of illicit activities in the late 20th century, including allegations that employees stole from residents and that prostitutes were using the exterior staircases to conduct business.

The New York City government enacted a law in 1970 that banned gender discrimination in public places, and the city&#x27;s Human Rights Commission ruled in 1972 that hotels were not exempt from this law. As such, the city ordered the Martha Washington to start accepting male guests beginning in 1973. Amid opposition from figures such as New York City Council president Sanford Garelik, the New York City Council later passed an amendment exempting single-sex residential hotels from the law. Occupancy had declined to 65 percent by 1979. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the lobby as &quot;dark and drab&quot;, having been downsized to make way for stores, and the bedrooms as having &quot;chipping paint and worn bedspreads&quot;. By then, the hotel&#x27;s owner Martha Washington Associates was spending $500,000 to repair the property, and most residents were still relatively young, being between 25 and 40 years old.

In 1982, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described the hotel as having 451 rooms and a female manager, although it did hire some male staff such as bellhops, clerks, and engineers. At the time, there was high demand for the hotel; its manager Janis Algar said that &quot;a lot of women from out of town don&#x27;t know the neighborhoods and are reluctant to take an apartment right away&quot;. The first-floor ballroom hosted the Danceteria nightclub, which opened in May 1991 and operated until 1993; during this time, there were many reports of illegal drug use. Afterward, the Danceteria space was converted into a club called the Melting Pot, which had three bars, then became a mosque by 1998. Toward the end of the 20th century, the Martha Washington functioned as a single room occupancy building. It had been among the last women&#x27;s hotels in Manhattan that were unaffiliated with a house of worship or a school. The owners had failed to pay taxes for several years and owed $160,000 in back taxes by 2000.

=== Operation as co-ed hotel ===
==== Late 1990s to early 2010s ====
Property Markets Group (PMG) bought the Martha Washington and Allerton hotels from Sillins in 1997. The group, which paid around $18 million for the Martha Washington, announced plans to convert it to a co-ed tourist hotel, saying the hotel was &quot;underused&quot;. At the time, three-fourths of the bedrooms were empty, and most had no bathrooms. The hotel closed for renovations in August 1998 and stopped accepting new guests, although 153 long-term residents were allowed to remain there. The Martha Washington began accepting male guests that October. Many existing female residents objected, with one resident calling the new policy &quot;a rapist&#x27;s dream&quot; because men could crawl into residents&#x27; bathrooms through the fire escapes. By the end of 1998, the Martha Washington was a standard tourist hotel; it was one of several residential hotels in the city that had been converted into tourist hotels at the end of the 20th century.

PMG undertook further renovations in 2000, spending about $49 million to upgrade the hotel. Kevin Maloney of PMG agreed to upgrade 83 tenants&#x27; rooms and allow them to continue paying the same rental rate if they endorsed a certificate of no harassment, which was required for the hotel. Another 37 tenants opposed the conversion and filed a lawsuit, claiming Maloney harassed them; despite this, Maloney received the certificate of no harassment and did not offer the dissenting tenants anything. Some residents protested against the renovations in 2000, claiming that PMG was disrupting their water and heat service and that there were construction hazards. Citylife was operating the hotel by 2000, with PMG as the owner, and continued to renovate the hotel through the end of that year. The group rebranded the Martha Washington as the Hotel Thirty Thirty in July 2000, a reference to the hotel&#x27;s address at 30 East 30th Street, though media sources had reported on the new name as early as the preceding October.

The Thirty Thirty initially operated as a budget hotel and still had about 90 long-term residents by 2003. Rockpoint Group bought a majority stake in the hotel from PMG in 2006. During the mid-2000s, the Thirty Thirty operated as a medium-priced hotel with 253 rooms. The hotel was closed in 2011 for renovations, reopening that December. At that time, it was renamed the Hotel Lola, after a fictional character created by the renovation&#x27;s designer Susan Jaques; this character was based partially on the 19th-century entertainer Lola Montez. The renovation cost $15 million, of which $12 million was funded by a loan issued by Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust. The hotel was divided into 276 rooms, which were designed in a minimalist style.

==== Early 2010s to present ====
King and Grove Hotels bought the Hotel Lola for $116 million from Rockpoint Group in June 2012 and renamed it the King &amp; Grove New York shortly thereafter. King &amp; Grove CEO Ed Scheetz and Chetrit Group co-owned the hotel until 2013, when Scheetz took over five of the partners&#x27; 14 properties, including the King &amp; Grove New York. Danny Meyer announced in October 2013 that he would open a restaurant at the King &amp; Grove New York, and he outlined plans the next year for a wood-fired pizzeria. Scheetz announced in May 2014 that King &amp; Grove would be rebranded as Chelsea Hotels and that the King &amp; Grove New York would be renovated and renamed back to the Martha Washington Hotel. Scheetz said he &quot;wanted the hotel to be more upscale&quot;, and he hired Annabelle Selldorf to redesign the interiors. The $20 million project involved renovating all of the hotel&#x27;s rooms, adding space for three restaurants, and moving the main entrance to 29th Street. By then, the hotel still had about 50 residents.

The renovation was completed in September 2014, and the Marta pizzeria opened later that year. Chelsea Hotels placed the Martha Washington up for sale in March 2015. The hotel was sold that November for $158 million to CIM, which planned to rebrand the hotel as the Redbury New York following a second renovation. The following year, CIM renamed the hotel the Redbury New York, and hospitality group SBE took over the hotel&#x27;s management. Dakota Development and Avenue Interiors redesigned the guest rooms. The hotel was themed to the music of the nearby Tin Pan Alley and the history of the NoMad neighborhood. The first rooms reopened in April 2016, and the hotel was fully reopened that October under the Preferred Hotels &amp; Resorts brand. The Redbury&#x27;s managers hired local firm Home Studios to redesign the lobby and rooms in mid-2019.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in early 2020, the Redbury began serving medical professionals. The hotel was otherwise closed to the general public for much of 2020, but patronage did not fully recover after pandemic-era restrictions were lifted. Danny Meyer moved his Maialino restaurant to the Redbury in late 2022. In August 2023, the New York City government began to use the hotel as temporary migrant housing, amid a citywide migrant housing crisis caused by a sharp increase in the number of asylum seekers traveling to the city. At the time, there were 250 rooms; the hotel began accommodating families with children, and it stopped accepting reservations. Danny Meyer closed his restaurants at the Redbury that month, citing delays in the full reopening of the hotel and the migrant crisis.

== Notable people and tenants ==
The poet Sara Teasdale stayed at the hotel during her New York visits from 1913 onward, and actress Louise Brooks relocated there from the Algonquin Hotel. The editor Louise E. Dew was a resident, and Jean H. Norris, the first female magistrate in New York state, also lived in the hotel in the early 20th century. Although a 10-room suite at the hotel was renovated for socialite Consuelo Vanderbilt in 1907, she never lived there. Veronica Lake, one of Hollywood&#x27;s most prominent actresses in the 1940s, was found to be working as a barmaid at the Martha Washington in 1962. After the story was published, several people offered Lake money and jobs in the entertainment industry, which she refused; Lake eventually was able to obtain other acting roles. The writer and public speaker Fran Lebowitz stayed at the hotel for two months when she first moved from New Jersey to New York in 1969.

From the 1900s onward, the hotel served as the headquarters of the Interurban Women&#x27;s Suffrage Council, the International Federation of Business Women, and the Committee on Women&#x27;s Work of the Republican National Committee. In subsequent years, the hotel also hosted organizations such as the American Gold Star Mothers in the 1940s.

== Impact ==

When the Martha Washington opened, Catherine King of the &quot;New York World&quot; wrote that &quot;when you go in{{nbsp}}... you are instantly reminded of a Martha Washington fichu&quot; and that the hotel was &quot;a sort of beautiful, well-behaved haven where the women who now languish in boarding houses and haven&#x27;t quite compassed apartments can go to live—and more&quot;. The hotel&#x27;s exclusivity led &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; to liken the Martha Washington to a women&#x27;s club in 1910. The hotel was not noted for its design; architectural critic Christopher Gray wrote in 2012 that &quot;the Martha Washington certainly does have a &#x27;special character&#x27;—a requirement for landmark designation—even if that character lies in its history, not its architecture.&quot;

After the hotel was renamed the Thirty Thirty in 2000, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic wrote that the hotel was hard to find despite its new name, the staff were confused, and the hotel as a whole was &quot;rough-hewn&quot;. The critic described the lobby as &quot;well polished&quot; but said that the guestrooms were only &quot;slightly larger than a janitor&#x27;s closet [and] are awash in the brown/green side of the Crayola box&quot;. Following the 2011 renovation, a critic for ABC News wrote: &quot;We find the check-in process disorganized and the modern minimalist room, with gray carpeting and no pictures on the wall, stark and sterile. And our tiny bathroom is unheated.&quot; When the Redbury opened in 2016, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; praised the hotel&#x27;s central location and food service, but criticized the styling and said the Redbury &quot;is a bit short on amenities&quot;. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; stated that &quot;the hotel features a contemporary ambiance with updated guest accommodations sporting a chic new look&quot;.

The hotel building was also depicted in an opening scene for the 1967 movie &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the hotel as a city landmark on June 19, 2012, and the hotel was inducted into Historic Hotels of America, an official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, in 2016. Additionally, the National Collaborative for Women&#x27;s History Sites, in collaboration with the William G. Pomeroy Foundation, placed the hotel on the National Votes for Women Trail in 2022.

<text>Mount Rainier National Park is a national park of the United States located in southeast Pierce County and northeast Lewis County in Washington state. The park was established on March 2, 1899, as the fourth national park in the United States, preserving including all of Mount Rainier, a stratovolcano. The mountain rises abruptly from the surrounding land with elevations in the park ranging from 1,600 feet to over 14,000 feet (490–4,300 m). The highest point in the Cascade Range, Mount Rainier is surrounded by valleys, waterfalls, subalpine meadows, and of old-growth forest. More than 25 glaciers descend the flanks of the volcano, which is often shrouded in clouds that dump enormous amounts of rain and snow.

Mount Rainier is circled by the Wonderland Trail and is covered by glaciers and snowfields totaling about . Carbon Glacier is the largest glacier by volume in the contiguous United States, while Emmons Glacier is the largest glacier by area. Mount Rainier is a popular peak for mountaineering with some 10,000 attempts per year with approximately 50% making it to the summit.

==Park purpose==
As stated in the foundation document:
==History==

Ninety-seven percent of the park is preserved as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System as Mount Rainier Wilderness, a designation it received in 1988. It is abutted by the Tatoosh, Clearwater, Glacier View, and William O. Douglas Wildernesses. The park was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 18, 1997, as a showcase for the National Park Service rustic-style architecture of the 1920s and 1930s, exemplified by the Paradise Inn and a masterpiece of early NPS master planning. As a Historic Landmark district, the park was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Native Americans===
The name of the mountain itself in Lushootseed is &quot;Tacoma&quot;, (pronounced &quot;Taquoma&quot;) the same as a nearby city in the Puget Sound region.

The earliest evidence of human activity in the area which is now Mount Rainier National Park, is a projectile point dated to circa 4,000–5,800 BP (before present) found along Bench Lake Trail (the first section of Snow Lake Trail).

A more substantial archeological find was a rock shelter near Fryingpan Creek, east of Goat Island Mountain. Hunting artifacts were found in the shelter. The shelter would not have been used all year round. Cultural affinities suggest the site was used by Columbia Plateau Tribes from 1000 to 300 BP.

In 1963 the National Park Service contracted Washington State University to study Native American use of the Mount Rainier area. Richard D. Daugherty lead an archeological study of the area and concluded that prehistoric humans used the area most heavily between 8000 and 4500 BP. Allan H. Smith interviewed elderly Native Americans and studied ethnographic literature. He found no evidence of permanent habitation in the park area. The park was used for hunting and gathering and for occasional spirit quests. Smith also came to tentative conclusions that the park was divided among five tribes along watershed boundaries; the Nisqually, Puyallup, Muckleshoot, Yakama, and Taidnapam (Upper Cowlitz). Subsequent studies cast doubt on Smith&#x27;s theory that the tribes had agreed upon boundaries before they entered into treaties with the United States in 1854–55.

===Park creation===
On March 2, 1899, President William McKinley signed a bill passed by Congress authorizing the creation of Mount Rainier National Park, the nation&#x27;s fifth national park. It was the first national park created from a national forest. The Pacific Forest Reserve had been created in 1893 and included Mount Rainier. It was enlarged in 1897 and renamed Mount Rainier Forest Reserve. John Muir had visited Mount Rainier in 1888. Muir and nine others, including Edward Sturgis Ingraham, Charles Piper, and P. B. Van Trump, climbed to the summit in what became the fifth recorded ascent.

The trip to Mount Rainier had played a role in reinvigorating Muir and convincing him to rededicate his life to the preservation of nature as national parks. At the time national forests, called forest reserves at first, were being created throughout the American West, under the utilitarian &quot;conservation-through-use&quot; view of Gifford Pinchot. Muir came to be known as a &quot;preservationist&quot;. He wanted nature preserved under the more protected status of national parks. But during the 1890s there was more public support for creating national forests than national parks. During that decade, Muir and his supporters were only able to protect one national forest as a national park. When the Pacific Forest Reserve was created in 1893, Muir quickly persuaded the newly formed Sierra Club to support a movement to protect Rainier as a national park. Other groups soon joined, such as the National Geographic Society and scientific associations wanting Mount Rainier preserved as a place to study volcanism and glaciology. Commercial leaders in Tacoma and Seattle were also in support, as was the Northern Pacific Railway. The effort lasted over five years and involved six different attempts to push a bill through Congress. Congress eventually agreed, but only after acquiring assurances that none of the new park was suitable for farming or mining and that no federal appropriations would be necessary for its management.

===2006 flooding===
Mount Rainier National Park closed because of extensive flooding as a result of the November 6, 2006 Pineapple Express rainstorm when of rain fell in a 36-hour period. Campsites and roads throughout the park were washed away. Power to Paradise and Longmire was disrupted. Sunshine Point Campground, just inside the Nisqually Entrance, was destroyed and has not reopened. Parts of the Carbon River Road, once a vehicle-accessible entrance to the park, also washed out. The road has since remained closed to vehicle traffic. On May 5, 2007, the park reopened to automobile traffic via State Route 706 at the Nisqually Entrance.

===Closures and reservations===

In November 2022, the National Park Service announced that access to the south side of the park beyond Longmire would be closed on weekdays due to inadequate staffing. Several recreation areas, including a sledding hill, were also closed for the rest of the winter season. The closure was unpopular with recreation groups and was modified in 2023 to allow winter access to Paradise from Thursdays through Mondays.

Beginning in 2024, timed entry reservations will be required for vehicles using entrances on the Paradise and Sunrise corridors during daylight hours in the peak summer months. The system was implemented due to increased crowding at the park between July and September, when 70 percent of the annual 1.6 million patrons visit and cause traffic congestion. NPS also considered using parking permits and bus shuttles from a remote parking lot similar to systems at other national parks.

==Biology==
===Flora===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation types, Mount Rainier National Park has an Alpine Meadows &amp; Barren, or Alpine tundra (&quot;52&quot;) potential vegetation type with an Alpine Meadow (&quot;11&quot;) potential vegetation form. The park&#x27;s vegetation is diverse, reflecting the varied climatic and environmental conditions encountered across the park&#x27;s 12,800-foot elevation gradient. More than 960 vascular plant species and more than 260 nonvascular plant species have been identified in the park.

===Fauna===
Mammals that inhabit this national park include cougar, black bear, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, snowshoe hare, weasel, mole, beaver, red fox, porcupine, skunk, marmot, deer, marten, shrew, pika, elk, and mountain goat. The common birds of this park including raptors are the thrush, chickadee, kinglet, northern goshawk, willow flycatcher, spotted owl, steller&#x27;s jay, Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, bald eagle, ptarmigan, harlequin duck, grouse, peregrine falcon, Canada jay, golden eagle, grosbeak and finch.

Fish that inhabit the lakes, rivers, and streams within the park include bull trout, cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, and sculpins. Anadromous fish enter the park during migratory cycles. Chinook salmon and coho salmon, although rare within the park boundary, can be found spawning in the White, West Fork, Puyallup, Mowich, and Carbon watersheds. Pink salmon spawn on odd-numbered years in heavy numbers up the White River near the park boundary. Due to historical stocking and damming of rivers in and around the park, native numbers of most salmonoids are unknown.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, the best definition for Mount Rainier National Park is Mediterranean-influenced humid continental climate (&quot;Dsb&quot;) or subarctic climate (&quot;Dsc&quot;), depending on the elevation. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Sunrise Visitor Center ( elevation) is 6a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -5.5 °F (-20.8 °C).

The National Park Service says that &quot;Paradise is the snowiest place on Earth where snowfall is measured regularly.&quot; During the 1971/72 year, of snow fell, setting a world record for that year. Subsequently, in the 1998/99 year, Mount Baker Ski Area received . Paradise holds the Cascade Range record for most snow on the ground with on March 10, 1956.



==Major attractions==

The entire park was designated a National Historic Landmark District on February 18, 1997, in recognition of the consistently high standard of design and preservation the park&#x27;s National Park Service rustic-style architecture. The park contains 42 locations designated on the National Register of Historic Places, including four National Historic Landmarks.

The park&#x27;s most popular natural features vary based on the season. During the spring, the remaining snow and waterfalls are visible from many trails and other portions of the park; a summertime wildflower bloom in July and August also attracts many visitors.

From 2008 to 2019, over 10,000 people per year have attempted to climb to the summit of Mount Rainier; a fee is levied by the National Park Service to fund ranger station and camp staffing as well as search-and-rescue services. , three companies are authorized to operate commercial mountain guide services in the national park for the entire year; single-trip guides are also available through 15 services that are authorized by the National Park Service. From 1967 to 1997, RMI Expeditions was the sole company authorized to organize commercial guided climbs to the summit until the program was opened to other companies to encourage competition. 

===Paradise===
Paradise () is the name of an area at approximately on the south slope of Mount Rainier in the national park. Paradise is the most popular destination for visitors to Mount Rainier National Park. 62% of the over 1.3 million people who visited the park in 2000 went to Paradise. Paradise, near the subalpine valley of the Paradise River, is the location of the historic Paradise Inn, built in 1916; Paradise Guide House, built in 1920; and Henry M. Jackson Visitor Center, built in 1966 rebuilt in 2008.

===Longmire===

 Longmire () is a visitor center in Mount Rainier National Park, located east of the Nisqually Entrance. The area is named after James Longmire, an early settler in Puget Sound. The area is in the Nisqually River valley at an elevation of between The Ramparts Ridge and the Tatoosh Range. Longmire is surrounded by old-growth Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock.
Longmire is the location of Mount Rainier&#x27;s National Park Inn, the Longmire Museum, and the 1928 National Park Service Administration Building, which is now a Wilderness Information Center. The National Park Inn is the only accommodation in the park open all year round.

Longmire is the second most popular destination for visitors to Mount Rainier National Park after Paradise. Of the more than 1.3 million people who visited the park in 2000, 38% visited Longmire. The Cougar Rock Campground is about north west of Longmire with 173 individual campsites and 5 group sites and open from late May through late September. Longmire is one of the starting points of the Wonderland Trail.

===Sunrise===
Sunrise () is a lodge and visitor center located in the northeastern part of the park. At an elevation of , it is the highest point in the park that is accessible by vehicle. There are miles of trails located all around Sunrise, such as Mount Fremont, Burroughs Mountain, and Sourdough Ridge. The lodge is reachable via a turnoff from State Route 410 near the White River entrance.

===Other developed areas===

&quot;Ohanapecosh&quot; is a campground (with 188 individual sites and 2 group sites, open from late May through late September), visitor center (closed during the 2013 season), and ranger station located in the southeastern portion of the park, approximately from the park boundary off State Route 123. Located in a deep valley among old growth forest at an elevation below , it is the only developed area of the park without a view of Mount Rainier. The Ohanapecosh Hot Springs, Grove of the Patriarchs, and Silver Falls are all located in the Ohanapecosh area.

The &quot;Carbon River Entrance Station&quot; is located in the northwest corner of the park off State Route 165 and is the site of the only rainforest at Mount Rainier. There is a campground and a short trail through the rainforest, as well as a trail to the Carbon Glacier, one of the lowest glaciers in the contiguous United States.

Mowich Lake is the largest and deepest lake in the park, located south of Carbon at the south end of State Route 165. A campground, picnic area, and hiking trail are located near the lake.

The two major roads into the northwest quadrant of the Park were severely damaged by the floods of 2006. The ranger station at the Carbon River entrance is staffed during the summer. No motor vehicles are permitted beyond that point.

==Transportation==

The park is primarily accessed by vehicles; in 2021, over 1 million vehicles carried the majority of the 2.4 million visitors to Mount Rainier National Park. The Nisqually Entrance is served by State Route 706, while State Route 410 cuts across the northeast corner of the park. State Route 123 connects the southeastern side of the park to State Route 410 and U.S. Route 12.

A regional airport was proposed for several sites in southern Pierce County that would be from the park. Its development was opposed by the park superintendent and environmental groups due to the potential effects of noise pollution and air pollution on wildlife, as well as traffic impacts around the park entrances.

<text>Eochaid mac Domangairt (died c. 697) was a king of Dál Riata (modern western Scotland) in about 697. He was a member of the Cenél nGabráin, the son of Domangart mac Domnaill and father of Eochaid mac Echdach; Alpín mac Echdach may be a son of this younger Eochaid.

He is named in Dál Riata king-lists, the Duan Albanach and the &quot;Synchronisms&quot; of Flann Mainistrech. In some sources he is called Eochaid Crook-Nose (&quot;Riannamail&quot;), but modern readings take this as being a garbled reference to Fiannamail ua Dúnchado rather than an epithet.

The death of &quot;Eochu nepos Domnaill&quot; (Eochaid grandson of Domnall Brecc) is reported in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; for 697, slain by Fiannamail ua Dúnchado.

<text>A &#x27; (; plural &#x27;) is a low-level administrative unit in the German federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt. A is typically composed of a small group of villages or towns. 

==Rhineland-Palatinate==

The state of Rhineland-Palatinate is divided into 163 , which are municipal associations grouped within the 24 districts of the state and subdivided into 2,257 Ortsgemeinden (singular Ortsgemeinde) which comprise single settlements.

Most of the were established in 1969. Formerly the name for an administrative unit was &quot;Amt&quot;. Most of the functions of municipal government for several municipalities are consolidated and administered centrally from a larger or more central town or municipality among the group, while the individual municipalities (Ortsgemeinden) still maintain a limited degree of local autonomy.

==Saxony-Anhalt==
The 11 districts of Saxony-Anhalt are divided into &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaften&quot; and, since 1 July 2009 also . Since the January 2010 government reform, there are 18 in Saxony-Anhalt.

<doc id="191269" wikidata="Q1192894" url="?curid=191269" title="Flight to Varennes">
<text>The Flight to Varennes (French: fuite de Varennes) during the night of 20–21 June 1791 was a significant event in the French Revolution in which the French royal family—comprising Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, the Dauphin Louis Charles, Marie-Thérèse, Madame Royale, and Madame Élisabeth—unsuccessfully attempted to leave Paris for Montmédy, along with loyal members of their retinue. The King hoped to regain his freedom there, with the protection of royalist troops, as the Revolution was intensifying and the threat to the royal family&#x27;s safety grew. They reached the small town of Varennes-en-Argonne, where they were stopped and arrested after being recognised at their earlier stop in Sainte-Menehould.

This incident was a turning point after which Parisian hostility towards the monarchy, as well as towards the King and Queen as individuals, became much more pronounced. The King&#x27;s attempted flight provoked charges of treason that ultimately led to his death in 1793. The flight failed due to a series of misadventures, delays, misinterpretations, and poor judgments. The King&#x27;s decisions on a number of matters, including the means and timing of the journey, allowed seemingly small matters to escalate.

The King&#x27;s flight was traumatic for Paris, inciting reactions ranging from anxiety to violence and panic. Everyone was aware that foreign intervention was imminent. The realisation that the King had effectually repudiated the Revolutionary reforms made up to that point came as a shock to people who had seen him as genuinely supporting the Revolution. Republicanism quickly evolved from being merely a subject of coffee-house debate to the dominant ideal of Revolutionary leaders.
The King&#x27;s brother, the comte de Provence, also fled on the same night, by a different route. He successfully escaped, and spent the French Revolution in exile, later returning as King Louis XVIII.

==Background==
After the violent march on Versailles in October of 1789, the royal family was forcibly transferred from the Palace of Versailles to the Tuileries Palace, where they were placed under virtual house arrest. Until then, Louis XVI had accepted many actions which disrespected his authority, but when the royal family was prevented from leaving the Tuileries to spend Easter at the château de Saint-Cloud in 1791, his lack of freedom became obvious.

==Objectives of flight==

The intended goal of the unsuccessful flight was to provide the King with greater freedom of action and personal security than was possible in Paris. At Montmédy, General François Claude Amour, marquis de Bouillé, had concentrated a force of 10.000 regulars of the old Royal Army who were considered to still be loyal to the monarchy. Bouillé himself had shown energy in suppressing a serious mutiny in Nancy in 1790. The troops under his command included two Swiss and four German mercenary regiments who were perceived as being more reliable in a time of general political unrest. In a letter drafted for presentation to the Tagsatzung at Zurich, the royalist baron de Breteuil stated that &#x27;&quot;His Majesty desires to have such imposing forces at his disposition, that even the most audacious rebels will have no other option than to submit&#x27;. The court expectation was that &#x27;numerous faithful subjects of all classes&#x27; would then rally to demand the restoration of the rights of the throne and that order would be restored without the need for civil war or foreign invasion.

The long-term political objectives of the royal couple and their closest advisors remain unclear. A detailed document entitled Declaration to the French People, prepared by Louis XVI for presentation to the National Constituent Assembly and left behind in the Tuileries indicates that his personal goal was a return to the legal revolution of the summer of 1789; he no longer rejected the abolition of orders, as in his Declaration of June 23, 1789, and he accepted civil equality. Private correspondence from Marie Antoinette takes a more reactionary line looking to a restoration of the old monarchy without concessions; though referring to pardons for all but the Revolutionary leadership and the city of Paris &#x27;if it does not return to its old order&#x27;.

== The flight attempt ==
Louis XVI committed himself and his family to a disastrous escape attempt from the capital to the eastern frontier on 21 June 1791. With the Dauphin&#x27;s governess, the marquise de Tourzel, taking on the role of a Russian baroness, the Queen and the King&#x27;s sister Madame Élisabeth playing the roles of governess and nurse respectively, the King a valet, and the royal children her daughters, the royal family made their escape leaving the Tuileries Palace at about midnight. The escape was largely planned by the Queen&#x27;s friend, the Swedish Axel von Fersen the Younger, and the baron de Breteuil, who had garnered support from Gustav III, King of Sweden. Fersen had urged the use of two light carriages that could have made the 200-mile journey to Montmédy relatively quickly. However, this would have involved the splitting up of the royal family, which Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette rejected, as they had promised to never separate. They decided on the use of a single heavy coach drawn by six horses. 
== Discovery and arrest ==
Due to the cumulative effect of slow progression, time miscalculations, lack of secrecy, and the need to repair broken coach traces, the royal family was thwarted in its escape attempt after leaving Paris. Louis XVI himself chatted with peasants while horses were being changed at Fromentières and Marie Antoinette gave silver dishes to a local official at Chaintrix. At Châlons, townspeople reportedly greeted and applauded the royal party. Finally, Jean-Baptiste Drouet, the postmaster of Sainte-Menehould, recognized the King, perhaps from his portrait printed on an assignat in his possession. Seven detachments of cavalry posted along the intended route had been withdrawn or neutralised by suspicious crowds before the royal party had reached them. The King and his family were eventually stopped arrested in the town of Varennes-en-Argonne, 50 km (31 miles) from their ultimate destination, the fortified royalist citadel of Montmédy.

Whether Bouillé&#x27;s army would have been numerous or reliable enough to change the direction of the Revolution and preserve the monarchy can never be known.

== Confinement to the Tuileries Palace ==

When the royal family finally returned under guard to Paris, the Revolutionary crowd met the royal carriage with uncharacteristic silence, men keeping their hats on as a sign of disrespect. The royal family, already confined to the Tuileries Palace, was only guarded more. From this point forward, the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an ever-increasing possibility. The credibility of the King as a constitutional monarch had been seriously undermined by propaganda following the escape attempt.

After they returned, the National Assembly agreed that the King could remain in power if he agreed to the Constitution. However, various factions in Paris like the Cordeliers and the Jacobins disagreed, and this led to a protest at the Champ de Mars; the protest turned violent, resulting in the so-called Champ de Mars Massacre.

From the autumn of 1791 on, the King tied his hopes of political salvation to the dubious prospects of foreign intervention. At the same time, he encouraged the Girondin faction in the Legislative Assembly in their policy of war with Austria, in the expectation that a French military disaster would pave the way for the restoration of the royal authority. Prompted by Marie Antoinette, Louis XVI rejected the advice of the moderate constitutionalists, led by Antoine Barnave, to fully implement the Constitution of 1791, which he had sworn to maintain. He instead secretly committed himself to a policy of covert counterrevolution.

==Abolition of the monarchy==
The King&#x27;s failed escape attempt alarmed many other European monarchs, who feared that Revolutionary fervor would spread to their own countries and result in instability outside France. Relations between France and its neighbours, already strained because of the Revolution, deteriorated even further with some foreign ministries calling for war against the revolutionary government.

The outbreak of the war with Austria in April 1792 and the publication of a manifesto by the Duke of Brunswick threatened the destruction of Paris if the safety of the royal family was again endangered. Upon hearing this, Parisian radicals stormed the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792.

This attack led in turn to the suspension of the King&#x27;s powers by the Legislative Assembly and the proclamation of the First French Republic on 21 September. In November, evidence of Louis XVI&#x27;s &#x27;secret dealings&#x27; with the deceased Revolutionary politician, Mirabeau, and of his counterrevolutionary intrigues with foreigners was found in a secret iron chest, the &quot;armoire de fer&quot;, in the Tuileries. It was now no longer possible to pretend that the reforms of the French Revolution had been made with the consent of the King. Some Republicans called for his deposition, others for his trial for alleged treason and intended defection to the enemies of Revolutionary France. On 3 December, it was decided that Louis XVI, who together with his family had been imprisoned since August, should be brought to trial for treason. He appeared twice, on 11 and 23 December, before the National Convention.

Convicted after an illegal trial, Louis XVI was guillotined on 21 January 1793. Nine months later, Marie Antoinette was also convicted of treason with no evidence, and also guillotined on 16 October. The late King&#x27;s son, Louis XVII, died in 1795 at the age of ten after years of neglect.

<text>Ferchar Fota (&quot;Ferchar the Tall&quot;) (died c. 697) was probably king of the Cenél Loairn of Dál Riata, and perhaps of all Dál Riata. His father is named as Feredach mac Fergusa and he was said to be a descendant in the 6th generation of Loarn mac Eirc.

Ferchar is first reported in the Annals of Tigernach in 678, when he led the Cenél Loairn to defeat on Tiree against &quot;the Britons&quot;, presumably those of Alt Clut. The battle is also reported by the Annals of Ulster, but Ferchar is not named. The second report of Ferchar is that of his death in 697.

Ferchar may have been king of Dál Riata from the 670s — the Duan Albanach assigns him a reign of 21 years — or he may have become king of Dál Riata only on the death of Domnall Donn in 696.

His sons Ainbcellach and Selbach were kings of Dál Riata.

<text>A county administrative board () is a Swedish Government Agency in each of the counties of Sweden, led by a vice-regal governor () appointed by the government for a term of six years. The lists of gubernatorial officeholders, in most cases, stretches back to 1634 when the counties were created by Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna.

The main responsibilities of the county administrative board is to coordinate the development of the county in line with goals set in national politics. In each county there is also a County Council which is a policy-making assembly elected by the residents of the county.

The capital of a county is in Swedish called &quot;residensstad&quot; (&quot;residence city&quot;) because it is the seat of residence of the governor.

<doc id="191272" wikidata="Q319523" url="?curid=191272" title="Vladislav Listyev">
<text>Vladislav (Vlad) Nikolayevich Listyev (; May 10, 1956 – March 1, 1995) was a Soviet, later Russian journalist and head of the ORT TV Channel (now government-owned Channel One).

== Career ==
Listyev was arguably the most popular journalist and TV anchor in Russia (he remains well remembered years after his death), and was a key force in bringing the voice of democracy to Russian television. Listyev first appeared on television as one of the hosts of a progressive and successful show &quot;Vzglyad&quot; (&quot;Glance&quot; or &quot;Outlook&quot;) in the late 1980s. Vzglyad was an outstanding show for that time, after the premiere many people thought it was allowed on TV only by some mistake of censors. The program was ‘like a fresh wind’, it raised the questions that never before were allowed for public discussion, such as Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, death penalty, reconstruction of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The program was watched weekly by as many as 100 million people. The other anchors were Alexander Lyubimov, Alexander Politkovsky, , Artyom Borovik and Yevgeny Dodolev.

He was also the first host of the Russian version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, which became popular. Following the success of &quot;Vzglyad&quot;, Listyev and his colleagues founded a TV company VID (&quot;Vzglyad i Drugiye&quot;—&quot;The View and the Others&quot;) that would produce programming for the First Channel of Central Television, the main TV channel in the Soviet Union (later called &quot;Ostankino&quot; and &quot;ORT&quot;). With VID, Listyev started a number of new TV projects —&quot;The Field of Wonders&quot; (the Russian version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;), &quot;Ugadai melodiu&quot; (&quot;Guess the melody&quot;, the Russian version of &quot;Name That Tune&quot;), &quot;Tema&quot; (&quot;The Theme&quot;), and &quot;Chas Pik&quot; (&quot;The Rush Hour&quot;). In 1995, Listyev moved from VID to ORT, where he was appointed director of the channel. One of Listyev&#x27;s very first moves as director was to order a temporary stop to all advertising, in effect excluding all unauthorized middlemen out of the lucrative advertising business, and consolidating future ad sales in the hands of the channel.

== Death ==
Shortly after his appointment, on the evening of March 1, 1995, when returning from the live broadcast of his evening show &quot;Chas Pik&quot;, Listyev was shot dead on the stairs of his apartment building. Valuables and a large sum in cash that Listyev had on him were left untouched, leading the investigators to conclude that the murder was either a political or business-related assassination. However, despite numerous claims made by investigators that the case was close to resolution, neither the gunmen, nor those who ordered the killing, were found.

The killing caused an enormous public outcry—in an unprecedented move, ORT and several other Russian TV channels shut down for the whole day on March 2, displaying only a picture of Listyev and the words &quot;Vladislav Listyev has been killed&quot; (). Days later, the channel was reorganized and after a number of different incarnations, came back as the government-controlled Channel One that Russian viewers are now familiar with. Listyev&#x27;s wake was visited by thousands of people, and President Boris Yeltsin went to the Studios of Channel One himself to deliver a highly emotional eulogy praising Listyev and mourning his death as a great loss for Russia.

There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind Listyev&#x27;s murder, and two possible causes have been isolated as the most likely: financial and political. When Listyev put the middlemen advertising agencies out of business, he deprived many corrupt businessmen of a source for enormous profits. From the political standpoint, Listyev enjoyed an enormous popularity rating among Russian citizens and could potentially influence the political mood of the whole country.

Paul Klebnikov&#x27;s article &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin?&quot; in &quot;Forbes&quot; accused Boris Berezovsky of ordering the murder. Berezovsky sued the magazine for libel in British court. Klebnikov expanded allegations in his book &quot;Godfather of the Kremlin: Boris Berezovsky and the looting of Russia&quot;. Forbes stated in court that it didn&#x27;t have evidence of Berezovsky&#x27;s complicity in Vlad Listyev&#x27;s murder or any other murder.

According to Yuri Felshtinsky and Vladimir Pribylovsky, top KGB officers Alexander Korzhakov and Alexander Komelkov may have plotted Listyev&#x27;s murder at the hands of Solntsevskaya Bratva. The authors implied that the motive was to steal the TV advertisement revenue and sponsor Oleg Soskovets for Russia&#x27;s presidency. The authors believed that Korzhakov also used the murder to blame Berezovsky and to prepare his arrest.

<text>Aid to the Civil Power (ACP) or Military Aid to the Civil Power (MACP) is the use of the armed forces in support of the civil authorities of a state. Different countries have varying policies regarding the relationship between their military and civil authorities.

== Australia ==
Under certain circumstances, the Australian Defence Force can be called upon to assist with law enforcement. State or territory civilian police have primary responsibility for law and order. Under section 119 of the Constitution of Australia, &quot;The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.&quot; This is further explained in section 51 of the &quot;Defence Act&quot; which states that:
Military forces have been deployed twice on the request of state or territory governments, and deployment authorised on one other occasion but not required:
* September 1970: The governor-general signed an order-in-council authorising the deployment of the army to East New Britain Province of Papua New Guinea, then a territory of Australia, to assist local police with riot control if necessary. The army was not required and the order was revoked in April 1971.
* February 1978: Following the Sydney Hilton bombing, 2,000 armed soldiers were deployed to Bowral and Mittagong to protect the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting and to protect the road and rail links between Sydney and the Southern Highlands.
* March 2002: 2,400 military personnel were deployed to protect the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Coolum Beach, Queensland, including armed F/A-18 Hornets patrolling overhead, just months after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Australian military regulations also allow the federal government to use military forces &quot;on its own initiative, for the protection of its servants or property, or the safeguarding of its interests&quot;. This has been done three times:
* April 1983: RF-111C reconnaissance aircraft were used to investigate construction work by the government of Tasmania which was preparing to dam the Gordon River in contravention of federal law. The evidence from the reconnaissance flights was used to gain an injunction from the High Court of Australia against the work.
* September 1989: Soldiers were deployed to Joint Defense Facility Nurrungar during a large political demonstration in which 300 protesters broke through the perimeter fence.
* August 2001: The Special Air Service Regiment was used during the Tampa affair.

In addition, unarmed troops and defence force equipment have been used in industrial disputes, such as the 1949 Australian coal strike and the 1989 Australian pilots&#x27; dispute, under the &quot;safeguarding of its interests&quot; provisions.

== Austria ==
The Austrian Armed Forces can be requested by all authorities on federal, state, district or municipal level in their respective sphere of competence in exceptional events. The federal government has to approve a deployment, if more than 100 soldiers are requested. ACP and MACP (called &quot;Assistenzeinsatz / AssE&quot;) can only be temporary, but are used extensively in Austria:

Deployments to support Law enforcement in Austria:
* in September 1990, after the end of the Cold War period, the Iron Curtain was demolished, but Austria had no border guard, so the military was ordered to guard the border lines. It was planned to end this deployment after 10 weeks, but it lasted until December 2011.
* in September 2013 military had to support the federal police during the Annaberg shooting, where three police officers and paramedic were murdered by a poacher.
* in September 2015 due to the European migrant crisis the Austrian military was deployed to the borders again. This deployment is still ongoing (in 2023)
* since August 2016 the military is guarding diplomatic missions and vulnerable institutions in Vienna
* in May 2020 soldiers and reservists started to support law enforcement during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. This deployment lasted until 2022.

Deployments to support civil authorities:
* in general, Austrian military is deployed in case of weather or environmental disasters
* in May 2020 soldiers and reservists started to support civil authorities and health care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. This deployment lasted until 2022.

== Canada ==
Canada has provisions, similar to the UK&#x27;s military aid to the civil authorities, for military aid to the civil power inscribed in its &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, an historical inheritance from its days as a British dominion. However, the application is significantly different due to the federal nature of Canada, where the maintenance of &quot;law and order&quot; is the exclusive right and responsibility of the provinces.

The political authority empowered to requisition armed military &quot;aid to the civil power&quot; is therefore the solicitor general of the affected province in accordance with the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, rather than the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; or its subsequent replacement, the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;. This requisition is forwarded directly to the Chief of the Defence Staff (not to the federal government of Canada) who is obligated by law to execute the request. However, the Chief of the Defence Staff alone can determine the nature and level of forces to be committed.

The requesting province may subsequently be billed to pay the cost of the military aid, although the federal government most often waives it. One exception in recent years resulted from Toronto mayor Mel Lastman&#x27;s request for military assistance following a snow storm in 1999, where at least 438 troops were deployed after the Ontario government acceded; this deployment was deemed by the Canadian government to be a trivialization of the military&#x27;s emergency response role and the requesting authority was billed accordingly.

While the military is legally free to decide how to deal with an issue in regard to which it has been called out, in practice it works under the direction of the police forces or government of the province that has requested its aid. Such requests are made relatively often for specialized resources such as armoured vehicles (e.g. hostage situations) and technical capabilities not possessed by police forces.

They are also called out in the case of police strikes in those provinces that have unionised provincial police forces. Quebec has not hesitated to call on the Army for such help because the Army is the only other agency with French-speaking units able to replace striking police; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police has few reserves able to provide a &quot;surge&quot; capability, and its French-speaking capability is limited.

Significant use of the Canadian Forces in aid of the Quebec civil power includes two relatively recent major civil crises:
* the October crisis of 1970
* the Oka crisis of 1990

As well, the Canadian Armed Forces have been called in to deal with labour crises, such as cavalry troops shipped to Edmonton to deal with an expected unemployed riot in 1931 and armoured cars to use strikers at Stratford in 1934. As well, in 1837 prior to Confederation, British troops were used to put down domestic rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada, and in the early years of existence as a federation, the Canadian Militia was mobilized for First Nation and Métis insurrections in its &quot;territories&quot;, 1869 and 1885 (the first and second Riel Rebellions).

The federal government can and does use the military in aid of its own responsibilities, such as guarding federal buildings and facilities. Since 1993, the Canadian Armed Forces have also provided the country&#x27;s federal counter-terrorism forces, replacing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in that function. (See JTF2 for details of request and control of this capability).

== Germany ==
The post-war Constitution of Germany strictly forbids the use of military force in police functions. In order to split the power of the government, the functions that MACP has in other countries are carried out by special or specialized police forces like the &quot;Bereitschaftspolizei&quot; units, each with a high number of officers, of each state police force, which are under the control of the state governments and not of the federal government.

For some actions, federal police forces can be used either by orders of the federal administration and federal judiciary or by request of the state government. The counter-terrorist unit GSG 9 is part of the Bundespolizei (until 2005 known as the &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot;) and is well known in Germany for its antiterrorist missions. However, several state police corps maintains similar units, the SEK &quot;(Spezialeinsatzkommando)&quot;. The &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; and the GSG 9 were historically combatants and they had military ranks, but have always been under the control of the Ministry of the Interior, similar to the internal troops in Eastern Europe during the Cold War period.

This strict separation between civil and military power was enacted to prevent the army from becoming a political power again in internal affairs and to secure its subordination to the civil power. Since the 1990s, a number of conservative politicians has called for an abolition of this rule, but there seems to be no majority for such a change.

But a new law was passed in September 2004, the Air Security Act (). From September 24, 2004 until February 2005 there was an exception from the use of military force regarding air security: In a case of imminent danger, the Bundeswehr and its air force branch, the German Air Force were authorised to use force against an aircraft.

As ultima ratio, the Minister of Defense was empowered to give the order to shoot down an aircraft if the aircraft was used as a weapon against humans and there was no other way to repel the attack. Air policing is a traditional task of the German Air Force. However, the Luftsicherheitsgesetz was declared unconstitutional on February 15, 2006, by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (). The court held that no civil aircraft may be shot down, even if the aircraft is used as a weapon by terrorist. The court held that the passengers&#x27; dignity and right to life would be violated if the aircraft was shot down.

In 2012, the judged that the military may intervene in &quot;exceptional, imminent incidents of catastrophic scale&quot; as a last resort. In the case of a hijacked plane by terrorists, the German Air Force may force the plane back or fire warning shots – a downing of the plane remains forbidden, unless every passenger of the plane is a terrorist. Such a case of &quot;exceptional, imminent incidents of catastrophic scale&quot; has to be determined, as ruled by the in 2013, by the whole Cabinet of Germany (), declaring a regulation void that previously allowed the Federal Minister of Defence () to decide solely.

==Indonesia==

In Indonesia, the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) is regulated in the &quot;Tri Darma Eka Karma&quot; Doctrine of the TNI which states the role of the military to be involved in non-combat roles known as &quot;OMSP&quot; (&quot;Operasi Militer Selain Perang&quot;) translated: &quot;Military operations other than war&quot;. This role is stated that the Military&#x27;s purpose for conducting the &quot;OMSP&quot; is to basically maintain the country&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and maintaining the safety of the nation as well as helping to improve the welfare of the people. According to the Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces General Hadi Tjahjanto, the tasks of the military in conducting the OMSP is to implement duties such as counter terrorism, border security, assisting regional governments, assisting the Indonesian National Police (Polri), disaster relief, assist security during state visits, as well as carrying out Peacekeeping operations under the United Nations. The Indonesian National Armed Forces is also in charge and responsible for the security of the President and Vice President, Former President and Former Vice-President along with their families and foreign VVIPs (Head of state or head of government) visiting Indonesia.

The Indonesian military to this day continues to be heavily involved in state civil affairs. According to the TNI commander, one of the role of the military is to basically assist the Indonesian National Police in terms of national security and order. The military are also likely to be called upon in response to civil unrest incidents which happen in the country such as the incidents which took place in Papua, Aceh, Poso, and Jakarta, other than that, the military is also involved in many tasks concerning to assist in security during national civil occasions such as during the national elections. The military are also likely to be deployed to assist the police during big-scale riots and protests which occur in urban settings near vital installations. Sometimes, the military are also posted in vital public locations together with the police such as in Airports and Railway stations during peak seasons.

Other than assisting the police, the military also assists other civil government institutions such as the National Search and Rescue Agency during disaster relief operations. Currently, responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indonesian Military has been highly involved in tackling the pandemic.

== Ireland ==
In Ireland, the Defence Forces provide assistance through Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) arrangements to the Government of Ireland. The Army, Naval Service and Air Corps also provide Aid to Civil Community and Aid to Government departments, particularly in a supplementary role to the Garda Síochána, the national police force. Responsibilities include national security (Supplementing high risk prisoner escort, intelligence), cash escorts, explosive ordnance disposal, maritime safety, search and rescue, drug interdiction (Navy), fisheries protection (Navy), patrols of vital state installations and border patrols (including armed checkpoints), air ambulance service and non-combatant evacuation. Examples include; Garda Air Support Unit (GASU) aircraft being flown and maintained by Air Corps personnel, the Air Corps and Naval Service assisting in search and rescue (the Irish Coast Guard (IRCG) is a civilian agency which operates in the Republic of Ireland and some parts of Northern Ireland), the Army Ranger Wing (ARW) carrying out domestic counter-terrorism operations and the Directorate of Military Intelligence carrying out domestic counter-intelligence duties.

== Italy ==

In 2008 the Italian Government decided to use soldiers from the Army, Navy and Air Force to patrol cities and protect high-value buildings (embassies, consulates, monuments). When military personnel patrol cities they are always accompanied by an agent from the Polizia di Stato (State Police), a military from the Carabinieri or a military from Guardia di Finanza.

Carabinieri are the 4th Armed force in Italy while Guardia di Finanza are a military body and are regular police forces with military status in Italy.

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, Military Aid to the Civil Power is one of the three classifications of Military Aid to the Civil Authorities. MACP encompasses the provision of military assistance (armed if necessary) in its maintenance of law, order and public safety using specialist capabilities or equipment in situations beyond the capability of the Civil Power. This includes capabilities such as Explosive Ordnance Disposal and mountain rescue (where it is provided by the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service).

Commander Home Command is the Standing Joint Commander responsible for the planning and execution of civil contingency operations within the UK landmass and territorial waters during any military aid to UK civil authorities.

==United States==

The Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878, generally prohibits Federal military personnel (except the United States Coast Guard) and units of the United States National Guard under Federal authority from acting in a law enforcement capacity within the United States, except where expressly authorized by the Constitution or Congress.

The original act only referred to the Army, but the Air Force was added in 1956 and the Navy and Marine Corps have been included by a regulation of the Department of Defense. This law is mentioned whenever it appears that the Department of Defense is interfering in domestic disturbances.

However, the National Guard may still be used for police-like duties if still under control of the state, as with the 1967 Detroit riot. Repeated caveats have been added to the Posse Comitatus Act over the years by subsequent legislation.

On June 1, 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 in response to riots following the murder of George Floyd.

<text>Nicholas William Leeson (born 25 February 1967) is an English former derivatives trader whose fraudulent, unauthorised and speculative trades resulted in the 1995 collapse of Barings Bank, the United Kingdom&#x27;s oldest existing merchant bank. He was convicted of financial crime in a Singapore court and served over four years in Changi Prison.

Between 2005 and 2011, Leeson had senior management roles at League of Ireland football club Galway United. After it suffered financial difficulties, he resigned from his position as chief executive officer. He is also active on the keynote and after-dinner speaking circuit, where he advises companies about risk and corporate responsibility. Since 2023, he has been a private investigator dealing with cases of financial misconduct.

==Early life==
Nick Leeson was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, to working-class parents on a council estate. His father was a self-employed plasterer, his mother a nurse. He attended Parmiter&#x27;s School in nearby Garston. After finishing sixth form in 1985 with six O Levels and two A level passes, Leeson was hired as a clerk with the Lombard Street branch of the Coutts private bank, where he settled paper cheques, crediting and debiting client accounts.

In 1987, Leeson moved to Morgan Stanley&#x27;s Futures and Options back office, clearing and settling listed derivatives transactions. With few prospects for a front office role, he joined Barings Bank two years later, at £12,000 () a year. With four other settlement specialists, Leeson was briefly seconded to Hong Kong to troubleshoot Barings&#x27; back office in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. He was then transferred to Barings&#x27; Jakarta office in 1990, handling some of Barings&#x27; unpaid share certificates which amounted to £100 million. Leeson returned to London in September 1991 to investigate a case of fraud in which a Barings employee had used a client&#x27;s account to trade on a proprietary basis until margin calls from the clearinghouses unraveled the scheme.

==Career==
===Barings Bank===
In April 1992, Barings decided to open a Futures and Options office in Singapore, executing and clearing transactions on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). Barings had held a seat on SIMEX for some time but did not activate it until Leeson, appointed general manager, was sent to head both front office and back office operations. Prior to leaving, Leeson was denied a broker&#x27;s licence in the UK because of committing fraud on his application, having failed to report a judgment against him entered by the National Westminster Bank. Neither Leeson nor Barings disclosed this denial when he applied for his licence in Singapore.

From 1992, Leeson made unauthorised speculative trades that initially made large profits for Barings: £10 million, which accounted for 10% of Barings&#x27; annual profit. He earned a bonus of £130,000 on his salary of £50,000 for that year. Leeson used one of Barings&#x27; error accounts (accounts used to correct mistakes made in trading) to hide his losses. He later stated that this account was first used to hide an error made by a subordinate who had been assigned to buy twenty futures contracts for Fuji Bank but sold them instead, costing Barings £20,000.

Leeson used this error account to cover further bad trades by himself and others. For example, he used it to cover mistakes made by one of his traders who frequently came to work after long nights of partying. Leeson believes that he first crossed into out-and-out criminal conduct when he forgot to reconcile a discrepancy of 500 contracts, costing Barings US$1.7 million. He concluded that the only way to hide such a massive error and keep his job was to hide it in the error account. Leeson insists that he never used the account for his own gain, but in 1996 investigators had located approximately $35 million in various bank accounts tied to him.

===Downfall and imprisonment===
By the end of 1992, the error account&#x27;s losses exceeded £2 million, increasing to £23 million in late 1993. This amount then ballooned to £208 million by the end of 1994. Leeson had followed a &quot;doubling&quot; strategy: every time he lost money, he would bet double the amount that was lost to recoup the amount. This had been successful for him in the past, including once in 1993 where he was able to cover a £6 million negative balance in the error account and after which he vowed not to use the account again. Leeson had to maintain his reputation as a trading genius and soon found himself hiding his losses there again. As the losses grew higher, Leeson fabricated cover stories to explain why he needed more cash from London; his sterling reputation protected him from close scrutiny.

The beginning of the end occurred on 16 January 1995, when Leeson placed a short straddle in the Singapore and Tokyo stock exchanges, essentially betting that the Japanese stock market would not move significantly overnight. The Great Hanshin earthquake hit early in the morning on 17 January, sending Asian markets, and Leeson&#x27;s trading positions, downward. Leeson attempted to recoup his losses by making a series of increasingly risky new trades (using a long-long future arbitrage), this time betting that the Nikkei Stock Average would make a rapid recovery. The recovery failed to materialise.

Leeson left a note reading, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot; and fled Singapore on 23 February. Losses eventually reached £827 million (US$1.4 billion), twice Barings&#x27; available trading capital. After a failed bailout attempt, Barings, which had been the UK&#x27;s oldest merchant bank, was declared insolvent on 26 February. After fleeing to Malaysia, Thailand and finally Germany, Leeson was arrested in Frankfurt and extradited to Singapore on 20 November 1995.

Leeson pleaded guilty to two counts of &quot;deceiving the bank&#x27;s auditors and of cheating the Singapore exchange&quot;, including forging documents. District judge Richard Magnus convicted Leeson and sentenced him to six and a half years in Changi Prison in Singapore. Leeson was released in July 1999 after serving at least two-thirds of his sentence (4 years and 4 months) for good behaviour, and having been diagnosed with colon cancer, which he survived despite grim forecasts. In 1996, Leeson published an autobiography, &quot;Rogue Trader&quot;, detailing his acts. A review in the financial columns of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;This is a dreary book, written by a young man very taken with himself, but it ought to be read by banking managers and auditors everywhere.&quot; In 1999, the book was made into a film of the same name starring Ewan McGregor and Anna Friel. The events also form the subject matter of a 1996 television documentary made by Adam Curtis, titled &quot;Inside Story Special: £830,000,000 – Nick Leeson and the Fall of the House of Barings&quot;.

In 2003, as a mature student, Leeson completed a BSc in Psychology at Middlesex University. He is a guest on the after-dinner and keynote speaking circuits, stating in 2019 that &quot;two events a month is enough to keep me in the manner to which I&#x27;m accustomed&quot;. Leeson still deals in stock markets, but only with his own money.

===Galway United F.C.===
Leeson was appointed commercial manager of Galway United in April 2005, rising to the position of general manager in November 2005. By July 2007 he had become the club&#x27;s chief executive officer. In February 2011, after the club encountered financial problems, he resigned his position.

===Investigator of financial misconduct===
In March 2023, Leeson joined Red Mist Market Enforcement Unit, a corporate intelligence firm run by former Black Cube operative Seth Freedman, and turned into an investigator of financial misconduct cases.

===Media appearances===
In June 2005, Leeson released a new book, &quot;Back from the Brink: Coping with Stress&quot;. It picks up his story where &quot;Rogue Trader&quot; left off, including in-depth conversations with psychologist Ivan Tyrrell. In 2013 he appeared in &quot;Celebrity Apprentice Ireland&quot; on TV3.

In July 2015, Singapore&#x27;s national daily newspaper, &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, published an e-book titled &quot;Guilty As Charged: 25 Crimes That Have Shaken Singapore Since 1965&quot;, which included the Nick Leeson case as one of the top 25 crimes that shocked the nation since its independence in 1965. The book was born out of collaboration between the Singapore Police Force and the newspaper itself. The paperback edition of the book was published and first appeared on the bookshelves in late June 2017. The paperback edition first entered the ST bestseller list on 8 August 2017, a month after its publication.

On 5 April 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that KPMG, the liquidators of Barings, had sold a trading jacket thought to have been worn by Leeson while trading on SIMEX in Singapore. The jacket was offered for sale on eBay but it failed to reach its reserve price despite a highest bid of £16,100. It was subsequently sold for £21,000. In October 2007 a similar jacket used by Leeson&#x27;s team but not thought to have been worn by Leeson himself sold at auction for £4,000.

His name is mentioned in the credits of &quot;Rogue Trader&quot; together with Barings Bank losses of US$1,400,000,000.

== Personal life ==
Leeson married Lisa Sims, later also known as Lisa Leeson, on 21 March 1992. The couple met in Jakarta, where both were working on Barings Jakarta&#x27;s office in 1990. Sims resigned from Barings Bank following her marriage to Leeson.

The couple divorced in 1997, a year after Leeson&#x27;s arrest. Sims later worked as a flight attendant for Virgin Atlantic.

In 2003, four years after his release from Changi Prison, Leeson married Leona Tormay, an Irish beautician.

Since 2023, he has been a private investigator dealing with cases of financial misconduct. He lives in Galway as of 2023.

<doc id="191275" wikidata="Q6851960" url="?curid=191275" title="Military aid to the civil community">
<text>Military aid to the civil community (MACC) is a phrase referring to the armed forces providing a service to the civilian community. It is used in many countries, particularly the United Kingdom.

==Australia==
The Australian Defence Force uses the term &quot;defence assistance to the civil community&quot; (DACC) which is divided into a range of categories.
* DACC category 1: Assistance in local emergency situations when immediate action is necessary to save life. This can be arranged at the local level between civilian emergency services and local ADF commanders.
* DACC category 2: Emergency assistance in more extensive or continuing disaster when state or territory resources are inadequate. This may include search and rescue, transport and evacuation, and communications. Requests for such assistance are normally made by state or territory governments to the federal government. Examples of this included large scale assistance after the 1955 Hunter Valley floods, Cyclone Tracy, 1989 Newcastle earthquake, Black Saturday bushfires and the 2011 Queensland floods.
* DACC category 3: Assistance in recovery from an emergency or disaster which is not directly related to the saving of life or property. Requests for such assistance are normally made by civilian emergency services through Emergency Management Australia. This includes, for example, providing temporary bridges where permanent bridges have been destroyed by fire or flooding.
* DACC category 4: Non-emergency assistance for public relations and ceremonial purposes. This includes requests for ADF equipment for use in film and television productions, flypasts for public events and performances by military bands. Requests for such assistance are normally made by the organiser through Department of Defence public affairs.
* DACC category 5: Non-emergency assistance of a minor nature. This includes training for emergencies and disasters and other forms of training, except training with law enforcement.
* DACC category 6: Support to civil authorities in the performance of non-emergency law enforcement where there is no possibility of the ADF using force.

==Canada==
Canadian legislation and practice is very similar to that of the UK, adjusted to reflect the constitutional authority and responsibility of provinces. Provinces are responsible for dealing with most situations requiring emergency military assistance. The military is frequently called out by provinces to deal with forest fires, floods, and ice storms and even lost children. 

Unlike military aid to the civil power, the procedures are much less formal and decision-making is decentralized. Since the military does not act in a police role when called out under these provisions, the main issue is the level of government that pays for this aid; in principle, when a province requests aid, it must pay the bill.

The military also provides certain full-time functions, including search and rescue at sea and for missing aircraft. It also provides patrols in the air and at sea to enforce civil regulations in regard to pollution, fishing, etc. However, this assistance is in support of other federal government departments and is the subject of simple inter-department memoranda of understanding.

==Germany==
MACC is one of the fundamental military tasks of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;. It was also historically very important to get legitimation and the support of the population, since German rearmament was a difficult political decision, taken under heavy criticism. 
The &quot;Grundgesetz&quot; (the German constitution) contains several rules regarding MACC. The use of force is not permitted by the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; under normal conditions. If force is required, the &quot;Bundesgrenzschutz&quot; federal police can be requested by the &quot;Bundesland&quot;.

Until the MACC during the North Sea flood of 1962 the constitution banned the use of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; in Germany totally.
Due to public acceptance problems in the early &quot;Bundesrepublik&quot;, the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; focused on MACC to improve its public image. During the North German Winter Catastrophe of 1978 and in several other incidents, the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; provided substantial aid to the population. The &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, with its SAR helicopters, is also part of the German air rescue system. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; also evacuates German citizens in international crises and catastrophes on behalf of the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; also offers a flying hospital for medical withdrawal, which evacuated terror victims from Tunisia and tsunami victims from Thailand.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, the defence forces may provide assistance to civil communities through aid to the civil power (ATCP) arrangements with the government of Ireland. The Irish Army, Naval Service and Air Corps may be called upon during times of natural emergencies, such as storms, floodings, large fires, etc. This is in addition to its ATCP and aid to government departments roles, which include national security, counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism, prisoner, cash, ammunition and explosives transport, maritime safety, search and rescue, drug interdiction, fisheries protection, patrols of vital state installations and border patrols (including armed checkpoints), air ambulance service and non-combatant evacuation.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, military aid to the civil community is one of the three classifications of military aid to the civil authorities. MACC covers the provision of unarmed military assistance to prevent or deal with the aftermath of a natural disaster or a major incident or, to assist civil sponsors either by carrying out special projects of significant social value to the community or by attaching individual volunteers to specific projects. As an example in 1968, the Royal Engineers formed a specialist squadron - 66 Plant Squadron based in Longmoor Hampshire from four specialist Plant troops (Southern (originally based in Longmoor), Midlands (originally based in Walsall, Northern originally based in Catterick and Scotland (originally based in Edinburgh). 66 Plant Squadron was at the time the biggest single Royal Engineers squadron with a large amount of Plant equipment (bulldozers, tippers, graders, rollers, excavators, cranes, and its transport vehicles). It consisted of 4 Troops, plus a HQ troop, a LAD (Light Aid Detachment from REME) and a Equipment &amp; Stores Troop. Examples of MACC assistance carried out was the Cleaning up after the Torrey Canyon Incident when an Oil tanker ran onto rocks in the South West of England and 66 Plant squadron was tasked to clean up the beaches of oil residue, rebuilding Oekyel Bridge in Scotland after floods, building an airstrip between Kylakin and Broadford on the Isle of Skye, building and maintaining ranges in various locations on Salisbury Plain, enhancing the Tank proving grounds at Bovington (Royal Armourd Corps Training centre in Dorset), Exercise Waterleap in Canada, Dredging the Avon &amp; Kennett Canal in Southern England to allow recreational boating, and building the range butts at Bisley in Hants. In addition various overseas MACC deployments were to Singapore, Malawi, Kenya and Canada.

==United States==
In the United States, military activities are generally severely limited, however, military assistance in rescue operations is common. This includes the national guard, who frequently are called to respond to domestic emergencies and natural disasters such as floods and severe weather, as well as elements of the regular and reserve armed forces when their expertise or equipment is needed, such as in response to Hurricane Katrina (US Naval hospital ships), the 2013 Colorado floods, and the 2014 Oso, Washington landslide.
