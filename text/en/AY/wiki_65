<text>In computing, Internet Key Exchange (IKE, versioned as IKEv1 and IKEv2) is the protocol used to set up a security association (SA) in the IPsec protocol suite. IKE builds upon the Oakley protocol and ISAKMP. IKE uses X.509 certificates for authentication ‒ either pre-shared or distributed using DNS (preferably with DNSSEC) ‒ and a Diffie–Hellman key exchange to set up a shared session secret from which cryptographic keys are derived. In addition, a security policy for every peer which will connect must be manually maintained.

==History==
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) originally defined IKE in November 1998 in a series of publications (Request for Comments) known as RFC 2407, RFC 2408 and RFC 2409:

* defined the Internet IP Security Domain of Interpretation for ISAKMP.
* defined the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP). 
* defined the Internet Key Exchange (IKE). 

 updated IKE to version two (IKEv2) in December 2005. clarified some open details in October 2006. combined these two documents plus additional clarifications into the updated IKEv2, published in September 2010. A later update upgraded the document from Proposed Standard to Internet Standard, published as in October 2014.

The parent organization of the IETF, the Internet Society (ISOC), has maintained the copyrights of these standards as freely available to the Internet community.

==Architecture==
Most IPsec implementations consist of an IKE daemon that runs in user space and an IPsec stack in the kernel that processes the actual IP packets.

User-space daemons have easy access to mass storage containing configuration information, such as the IPsec endpoint addresses, keys and certificates, as required. Kernel modules, on the other hand, can process packets efficiently and with minimum overhead—which is important for performance reasons.

The IKE protocol uses UDP packets, usually on port 500, and generally requires 4–6 packets with 2–3 round trips to create an ISAKMP security association (SA) on both sides. The negotiated key material is then given to the IPsec stack. For instance, this could be an AES key, information identifying the IP endpoints and ports that are to be protected, as well as what type of IPsec tunnel has been created. The IPsec stack, in turn, intercepts the relevant IP packets if and where appropriate and performs encryption/decryption as required. Implementations vary on how the interception of the packets is done—for example, some use virtual devices, others take a slice out of the firewall, etc.

IKEv1 consists of two phases: phase 1 and phase 2.

===IKEv1 phases===

IKE phase one&#x27;s purpose is to establish a secure authenticated communication channel by using the Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm to generate a shared secret key to encrypt further IKE communications. This negotiation results in one single bi-directional ISAKMP security association. The authentication can be performed using either pre-shared key (shared secret), signatures, or public key encryption. Phase 1 operates in either Main Mode or Aggressive Mode. Main Mode protects the identity of the peers and the hash of the shared key by encrypting them; Aggressive Mode does not.

During IKE phase two, the IKE peers use the secure channel established in Phase 1 to negotiate Security Associations on behalf of other services like IPsec. The negotiation results in a minimum of two unidirectional security associations (one inbound and one outbound). Phase 2 operates only in Quick Mode.

===Problems with IKE===
Originally, IKE had numerous configuration options but lacked a general facility for automatic negotiation of a well-known default case that is universally implemented. Consequently, both sides of an IKE had to exactly agree on the type of security association they wanted to create option by option or a connection could not be established. Further complications arose from the fact that in many implementations the debug output was difficult to interpret, if there was any facility to produce diagnostic output at all.

The IKE specifications were open to a significant degree of interpretation, bordering on design faults (Dead Peer Detection being a case in point), giving rise to different IKE implementations not being able to create an agreed-upon security association at all for many combinations of options, however correctly configured they might appear at either end.

===Improvements with IKEv2===

The IKEv2 protocol was described in Appendix A of RFC 4306 in 2005. The following issues were addressed:

* Fewer Requests for Comments (RFCs): The specifications for IKE were covered in at least three RFCs, more if one takes into account NAT traversal and other extensions that are in common use. IKEv2 combines these in one RFC as well as making improvements to support for NAT traversal (Network Address Translation (NAT)) and firewall traversal in general.
* Standard Mobility support: There is a standard extension for IKEv2 named [rfc:4555 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol] (MOBIKE) (see also, IPsec) used to support mobility and multihoming for it and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). By use of this extension IKEv2 and IPsec can be used by mobile and multihomed users.
* NAT traversal: The encapsulation of IKE and ESP in User Datagram Protocol (UDP port 4500) enables these protocols to pass through a device or firewall performing NAT.
* Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) support: IKEv2 allows for the SCTP protocol as used in Internet telephony protocol, Voice over IP (VoIP).
* Simple message exchange: IKEv2 has one four-message initial exchange mechanism where IKE provided eight distinctly different initial exchange mechanisms, each one of which had slight advantages and disadvantages.
* Fewer cryptographic mechanisms: IKEv2 uses cryptographic mechanisms to protect its packets that are very similar to what IPsec ESP uses to protect the IPsec packets. This led to simpler implementations and certifications for Common Criteria and FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), which require each cryptographic implementation to be separately validated.
* Reliability and State management: IKEv2 uses sequence numbers and acknowledgments to provide reliability and mandates some error processing logistics and shared state management. IKE could end up in a dead state due to the lack of such reliability measures, where both parties were expecting the other to initiate an action - which never eventuated. Work arounds (such as Dead-Peer-Detection) were developed but not standardized. This meant that different implementations of work-arounds were not always compatible.
* Denial of Service (DoS) attack resilience: IKEv2 does not perform much processing until it determines if the requester actually exists. This addressed some of the DoS problems suffered by IKE which would perform a lot of expensive cryptographic processing from spoofed locations.

: Supposing HostA has a Security Parameter Index (SPI) of codice_1 and HostB has an SPI of codice_2, the scenario would look like this:

: If HostB (the responder) is experiencing large amounts of half-open IKE connections, it will send an unencrypted reply message of codice_3 to HostA (the initiator) with a notify message of type codice_4, and will expect HostA to send an codice_3 request with that cookie value in a notify payload to HostB. This is to ensure that the initiator is really capable of handling an IKE response from the responder.

==Protocol extensions==
The IETF ipsecme working group has standardized a number of extensions, with the goal
of modernizing the IKEv2 protocol and adapting it better to high volume,
production environments. These extensions include:

* IKE session resumption: the ability to resume a failed IKE/IPsec &quot;session&quot; after a failure, without the need to go through the entire IKE setup process ().
* IKE redirect: redirection of incoming IKE requests, allowing for simple load-balancing between multiple IKE endpoints ().
* IPsec traffic visibility: special tagging of ESP packets that are authenticated but not encrypted, with the goal of making it easier for middleboxes (such as intrusion detection systems) to analyze the flow ().
* Mutual EAP authentication: support for EAP-only (i.e., certificate-less) authentication of both of the IKE peers; the goal is to allow for modern password-based authentication methods to be used ().
* Quick crash detection: minimizing the time until an IKE peer detects that its opposite peer has crashed ().
* High availability extensions: improving IKE/IPsec-level protocol synchronization between a cluster of IPsec endpoints and a peer, to reduce the probability of dropped connections after a failover event ().

==Implementations==
IKE is supported as part of the IPsec implementation in Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. The ISAKMP/IKE implementation was jointly developed by Cisco and Microsoft.

Microsoft Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 partially support IKEv2 () as well as MOBIKE () through the &quot;VPN Reconnect&quot; feature (also known as &quot;Agile VPN&quot;).

There are several open source implementations of IPsec with associated IKE capabilities. On Linux, Libreswan, Openswan and strongSwan implementations provide an IKE daemon which can configure (i.e., establish SAs) to the KLIPS or XFRM/NETKEY kernel-based IPsec stacks. XFRM/NETKEY is the Linux native IPsec implementation available as of version 2.6.

The Berkeley Software Distributions also implements IPsec, IKE daemon via the OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework (OCF), which makes supporting cryptographic accelerators much easier. OCF has recently been ported to Linux.

A number of network equipment vendors have created their own IKE daemons (and IPsec implementations), or license a stack from one another.

There are a number of implementations of IKEv2 and some of the companies dealing in IPsec certification and interoperability testing are starting to hold workshops for testing as well as updated certification requirements to deal with IKEv2 testing.

The following open source implementations of IKEv2 are available:
* OpenIKEv2,
* strongSwan,
* Libreswan,
* Openswan,
* Racoon from the KAME project,
* iked from the OpenBSD project.

==Vulnerabilities==
Leaked NSA presentations released in 2014 by indicate that IKE is being exploited in an unknown manner to decrypt IPsec traffic, as is ISAKMP. The researchers who discovered the Logjam attack state that breaking a 1024-bit Diffie–Hellman group would break 66% of VPN servers, 18% of the top million HTTPS domains, and 26% of SSH servers, which the researchers claim is consistent with the leaks. This claim was refuted in 2015 by both Eyal Ronen and Adi Shamir in their paper &quot;Critical Review of Imperfect Forward Secrecy&quot; and by Paul Wouters of Libreswan in a 2015 article &quot;66% of VPN&#x27;s are not in fact broken&quot;.

IPsec VPN configurations which allow for negotiation of multiple configurations are subject to MITM-based downgrade attacks between the offered configurations, with both IKEv1 and IKEv2. This can be avoided by careful segregation of client systems onto multiple service access points with stricter configurations.

Both versions of the IKE standard are susceptible to an offline dictionary attack when a low entropy password is used. For the IKEv1 this is true for main mode and aggressive mode.

<doc id="194342" wikidata="Q228584" url="?curid=194342" title="Svetlana Alliluyeva">
<text>Svetlana Iosifovna Alliluyeva (née Stalina; 28 February 1926 – 22 November 2011), later known as Lana Peters, was the youngest child and only daughter of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and his second wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva. In 1967, she became an international sensation when she defected to the United States and, in 1978, became a naturalized citizen. From 1984 to 1986, she briefly returned to the Soviet Union and had her Soviet citizenship reinstated. She was Stalin&#x27;s last surviving child.

==Early life==
Svetlana Stalina was born on 28 February 1926. As her mother was interested in pursuing a professional career, Alexandra Bychokova was hired as a nanny to look after Alliluyeva and her older brother Vasily (born 1921). Alliluyeva and Bychokova became quite close, and remained friends for 30 years, until Bychokova died in 1956.

On 9 November 1932, Alliluyeva&#x27;s mother shot herself. To conceal the suicide, the children were told that she had died of peritonitis, a complication from appendicitis. It would be 10 years before they learned the truth of their mother&#x27;s death.

In 1933, Alliluyeva and Vasily began attending ; while Vasily was transferred to a new school in 1937, Alliluyeva would stay until 1943 when she graduated the 10th grade. At the school, Alliluyeva was given no special treatment, and was regarded simply as another student.

Several other relatives of Alliluyeva were killed in the aftermath of the Great Purge, including her aunt Anna, and Anna&#x27;s husband, Stanislav Redens, who was shot in January of 1940.

On 15 August 1942, Winston Churchill saw Alliluyeva in Stalin&#x27;s private apartments at the Kremlin, describing her as &quot;a handsome red-haired girl, who kissed her father dutifully&quot;. Churchill says Stalin &quot;looked at me with a twinkle in his eye as if, so I thought, to convey &#x27;You see, even we Bolsheviks have a family life.&#x27; &quot;

At the age of sixteen, Alliluyeva fell in love with Aleksei Kapler, a Jewish Soviet filmmaker who was 38 years old. Her father vehemently disapproved of the relationship and Kapler was sentenced to five years of exile in 1943 to Vorkuta and was then sentenced again in 1948 to five years in labor camps in Inta.

==Marriages==
Alliluyeva was first married in 1944 to , a student at Moscow University&#x27;s Institute of International Affairs. Her father did not like Morozov, who was Jewish, though he never met him. They had one child, a son Iosif, who was born in 1945. The couple divorced in 1947, but remained close friends for decades afterwards.

Alliluyeva&#x27;s second marriage was arranged for her to Yuri Zhdanov, the son of Stalin&#x27;s right-hand man Andrei Zhdanov and himself one of Stalin&#x27;s close associates. The couple married early in 1949. Alliluyeva lived with Zhdanov&#x27;s family at this time, though felt herself dominated by his mother, Zinaida, which was something Stalin had warned her of. Yuri was devoted to Zinaida, and busied himself with Party work, so did not spend a lot of time with Alliluyeva. In 1950, Alliluyeva gave birth to a daughter, Yekaterina. The marriage was dissolved soon afterwards.

In 1962, she married Ivan Svanidze, the nephew of Stalin&#x27;s first wife, Kato Svanidze, soon after meeting him for the first time since his parents&#x27; arrest in 1937. They went against Soviet policy by marrying in a church. Svanidze was not healthy, owing to difficulties of his internal exile in Kazakhstan, and the marriage ended within a year.

From 1970 to 1973, she was married to American architect William Wesley Peters (a son-in-law of Frank Lloyd Wright), with whom she had a daughter, Olga Peters (later known also as Chrese Evans).

==After the death of Stalin==
After her father&#x27;s death in 1953, Alliluyeva worked as a lecturer and translator in Moscow. Her training was in History and Political Thought, a subject she was forced to study by her father, although her true passion was literature and writing. In a 2010 interview, she stated that his refusal to let her study arts and his treatment of Kapler were the two times that Stalin &quot;broke my life&quot;, and that Stalin loved her but was &quot;a very simple man. Very rude. Very cruel.&quot; When asked at a New York conference about whether she agreed with her father&#x27;s rule, she said that she was disapproving of a lot of his decisions but also noted that the responsibility for them also lay with the Communist regime in general.

==Relationship with Brajesh Singh==
In 1963, while in hospital for a tonsillectomy, Alliluyeva met Kunwar Brajesh Singh, an Indian Communist visiting Moscow. The two fell in love. Singh was mild-mannered and well-educated but gravely ill with bronchiectasis and emphysema. The romance grew deeper and stronger still while the couple were recuperating in Sochi near the Black Sea. Singh returned to Moscow in 1965 to work as a translator, but he and Alliluyeva were not allowed to marry. He died the following year, in 1966. For her first trip outside the Soviet Union, she was allowed to travel to India to take his ashes to his family to pour into the Ganges river. In an interview on 26 April 1967, she referred to Singh as her husband but also stated that they were never allowed to marry officially.

==Political asylum and later life==
Alliluyeva asked to have an official permission to stay in India through the Soviet ambassador, Ivan Benediktov. However, her request was not accepted, and instead, she was ordered to return to the Soviet Union. Then, on 9 March 1967, Alliluyeva approached the United States Embassy in New Delhi. After she stated her desire to defect in writing, the United States ambassador Chester Bowles offered her political asylum and a new life in the United States.

Alliluyeva accepted. The Indian government feared condemnation by the Soviet Union, so she was immediately sent from India to Rome. When the Qantas flight arrived in Rome, Alliluyeva immediately traveled farther to Geneva, Switzerland, where the government arranged her a tourist visa and accommodation for six weeks. She traveled to the United States, leaving her adult children in the USSR. Upon her arrival in New York City in April 1967, she gave a press conference denouncing her father&#x27;s legacy and the Soviet government.

After living for several months in Mill Neck, Long Island under Secret Service protection, Alliluyeva moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where she lectured and wrote, later moving to Pennington, and then to Wisconsin.

In a 2010 interview, she described herself as &quot;quite happy here [in Wisconsin].&quot; Her children who were left behind in the Soviet Union did not maintain contact with her. While Western sources saw a KGB hand behind this, her children claimed that this is because of her complex character. In 1983, after the Soviet government had stopped blocking Alliluyeva&#x27;s attempts to communicate with her USSR-based children, her son Iosif began to call her regularly and planned to visit her in England, but was refused permission to travel by the Soviet authorities.

She experimented with various religions. While some claim she had money problems, others argue that her financial situation was good, because of her great popularity. For example, her first book, &quot;Twenty Letters to a Friend&quot;, caused a worldwide sensation and brought her, some estimate, about $2,500,000. Alliluyeva herself stated that she gave away much of her book proceeds to charity and by around 1986 had become impoverished, facing debt and failed investments.

In 1970, Alliluyeva answered an invitation from Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s widow, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright, to visit Wright&#x27;s winter studio, Taliesin West, in Scottsdale, Arizona. In 1978, Alliluyeva became a US citizen as Lana Peters, and in 1982, she moved with her daughter to Cambridge in England, where they shared an apartment near the Cambridge University Botanic Garden.

In October 1984, during a time where Stalin&#x27;s legacy saw partial rehabilitation in the Soviet Union, she moved back together with her daughter Olga, and both were given Soviet citizenship.

The British journalist Miriam Gross with whom Alliluyeva conducted her final interview before moving back from England to the Soviet Union in 1984, described Svetlana&#x27;s increasingly fragile state of mind in a series of letters she wrote to Gross following the interview:

In April 1986, she again moved back from the Soviet Union to the U.S. with Olga, and after her return denied anti-Western comments she had made while back in the USSR (including that she had not enjoyed &quot;one single day&quot; of freedom in the West and had been a pet of the CIA).

Alliluyeva, for the most part, lived the last two years of her life in southern Wisconsin, either in Richland Center or in Spring Green, the location of Wright&#x27;s summer studio &quot;Taliesin.&quot; She died on 22 November 2011 from complications arising from colon cancer in Richland Center, where she had spent time while visiting from Cambridge.

Olga Margedant Peters (b. 21 May 1971), Alliluyeva&#x27;s daughter with Peters, now goes by the name Chrese Evans and lives in Portland, Oregon. Her older daughter, Yekaterina, is a volcanologist in Siberia&#x27;s Kamchatka Peninsula. Alliluyeva&#x27;s son Iosif, a cardiologist, died in Russia in 2008. Iosif&#x27;s son Ilya Voznesensky was previously in a relationship with Boris Berezovsky&#x27;s daughter Elizaveta, with whom he has a son, Savva.
==Religion==
Alliluyeva was baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church on 20 March 1963. During her years of exile, she experimented with various religions. She then turned to the Orthodox Church and is also reported to have thought of becoming a nun.

In 1967, Alliluyeva found herself spending time with Roman Catholics in Switzerland and encountered many denominations during her time in the United States. She received a letter from Father Garbolino, an Italian Catholic priest from Pennsylvania, inviting her to make a pilgrimage to Fátima, Portugal, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the famous apparitions there. In 1969, Garbolino was in New Jersey and went to visit Alliluyeva at Princeton. In California, she lived with a Catholic couple, Michael and Rose Ginciracusa, for two years (1976–78). She read books by authors such as Raissa Maritain. While living in Cambridge, on 13 December 1982, the feast of Saint Lucy of Syracuse, Alliluyeva converted to Catholicism.

==Works ==
While in the Soviet Union, Alliluyeva had written a memoir in Russian in 1963. The manuscript was carried safely out of the country by Indian Ambassador T. N. Kaul, who returned it to her in New Delhi. Alliluyeva handed her memoir over to the CIA agent Robert Rayle at the time of her own defection. Rayle made a copy of it. The book was titled &quot;Twenty Letters to a Friend&quot; (&quot;Dvadtsat&#x27; pisem k drugu&quot;). It was the only thing other than a few items of clothing taken by Alliluyeva on a secret passenger flight out of India. Raymond Pearson, in &quot;Russia and Eastern Europe&quot;, described Alliluyeva&#x27;s book as a naïve attempt to shift the blame for Stalinist crimes onto Lavrentiy Beria, and whitewash her own father.

<doc id="194343" wikidata="Q2360966" url="?curid=194343" title="Owen Roe O'Neill">
<text>Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill (Irish: &quot;Eoghan Ruadh Ó Néill;&quot; – 6 November 1649) was a Gaelic Irish soldier and one of the most famous of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty of Ulster. O&#x27;Neill left Ireland at a young age and spent most of his life as a mercenary in the Spanish Army serving against the Dutch in Flanders during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. After the Irish Rebellion of 1641, O&#x27;Neill returned and took command of the Irish Confederate Ulster Army. He is known for his victory at the Battle of Benburb in 1646.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s later years were marked by infighting amongst the Confederates, and in 1647 he led his army to seize power in the capital of Kilkenny. His troops clashed with rival forces of the Confederacy, leading to O&#x27;Neill forming a temporary alliance with Charles Coote&#x27;s English Parliamentary forces in Ulster. He initially rejected a treaty of alliance between the Confederates and the Irish Royalists, but faced with the Cromwellian invasion he changed his mind. Shortly after agreeing to an alliance with the 1st Marquess of Ormond, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in which he was promised an Earldom, O&#x27;Neill died on Tuesday, 6 November 1649.

== Early life ==
O&#x27;Neill was the illegitimate son of Art MacBaron O&#x27;Neill, a son of Matthew O&#x27;Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon and younger half-brother of Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who held lands in County Armagh. His alleged great-grandfather was Conn O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone, the most powerful figure in Ulster and the first O&#x27;Neill to take a title from the Crown as part of the surrender and regrant policy of the Tudor era. Through Conn, he was descended from Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare, the leading Anglo-Irish noble of the era, member of the Earls of Kildare, who more or less ruled Ireland in the 15th and early 16th centuries.

His year of birth is unknown but was likely to have been around 1585. It is also not known exactly where he was born, but it was probably near Loughgall in County Armagh where his father&#x27;s estates were and where O&#x27;Neill spent much of his youth. His mother was the daughter of Hugh Connolly O&#x27;Reilly, lord of Breifne O&#x27;Reilly in County Cavan.

O&#x27;Neill was educated by Franciscan monks who not only taught him Latin but also the art of war. He later fought against the English in the Nine Years&#x27; War, with the Irish war effort led by his great-uncle Hugh O&#x27;Neill. He would have been only a teen at the time and it is unknown what his role would have been, but it may have fueled his deep hatred for the English later in his life.

Several of his elder brothers also took part in the rebellion, some of whom died fighting. Another, Brian MacArt O&#x27;Neill, was hanged for manslaughter in 1607. One of his nephews was Daniel O&#x27;Neill, a Protestant who became a noted cavalier in England during the 1640s. Another of his nephews, Hugh Dubh O&#x27;Neill fought in the Confederate Wars and famously inflicted heavy casualties on Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army during the Siege of Clonmel in 1650.

== In Spanish Service ==
As a young man O&#x27;Neill left Ireland (likely in 1607 during the Flight of the Earls). He grew up in the Spanish Netherlands and served for 40 years in the Irish regiment of the Spanish army. Most of his combat was in the Eighty Years&#x27; War against the Dutch Republic in Flanders and against the French in the Franco-Spanish War. He distinguished himself notably at the Siege of Arras in 1640, where he commanded the Spanish garrison and held out for 48 days with 2,000 men (many of whom were fellow Irishmen), against a French army of 35,000. Throughout his career O&#x27;Neill was known to be an expert in defensive warfare.

Like many Irish officers in Spanish service, O&#x27;Neill was deeply opposed to English rule in Ireland. In 1627, he was involved in petitioning the Spanish monarchy to invade Ireland using the Irish Spanish regiments. O&#x27;Neill proposed that Ireland be made a republic under Spanish protection to avoid in-fighting between Irish Catholic landed families over which of them would provide a prince or king of Ireland. This plan came to nothing.

However, in 1642, O&#x27;Neill planned to return to Ireland with 300 veterans to aid the Irish Rebellion of 1641, apparently at the invitation of one of the organizers of the rebellion Rory O&#x27;Moore. He was given money by the Pope, with which he bought a frigate, the &quot;St. Francis,&quot; and also purchased weapons and cannons to arm the ships. The ship, often described as the flagship of the Confederate naval forces during the war, was the first to fly the Confederate flag. He was joined by several of his countrymen and his sons. They managed to evade several Royal Navy vessels which were specially deployed to intercept O&#x27;Neill. Upon landing in Ulster he was met by Sir Felim O&#x27;Neill who escorted him to the Irish-held fort of Charlemont.

Twelve more ships from continental Europe carrying experienced Irish officers along with weapons and supplies for the Irish war effort would land in Ireland later, reviving the rebellion, and adding considerable knowledge and experience to the Catholic ranks, which would prove extremely valuable.

== Return to Ireland ==
The rebellion had broken out in autumn 1641, with the rebel leaders issuing the Proclamation of Dungannon declaring their aim of enhancing Catholic rights while declaring their continued loyalty to King Charles I. Despite a failed attempt to seize Dublin Castle, the rebels enjoyed success across Ulster and the uprising spread to other parts of the country. However, the rebels then suffered several defeats to the Royal Irish Army and the Scottish Covenanter Army in Ireland and by the time Eoghan Rua arrived the rising was increasingly in trouble.

The subsequent war, known as the Irish Confederate Wars, was part of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms—civil wars throughout Britain and Ireland. Because of his military experience, O&#x27;Neill was recognised on his return to Ireland, at Doe Castle in County Donegal on 8 July 1642, as the leading representative of the O&#x27;Neills and head of the Ulster Irish. Sir Phelim O&#x27;Neill resigned the northern command of the Irish rebellion in Eoghan Rua&#x27;s favour and escorted him from Lough Swilly to Charlemont.

Upon arrival in Ireland, he received a letter from an English parliamentarian general by the name of Leslie, telling O&#x27;Neill that he was sad O&#x27;Neill, as an experienced officer, was committing himself to such a cause and that he should return to Spain. O&#x27;Neill responded that his cause in Ireland was far more honourable than an English general fighting against his own King.

But distrust between the kinsmen was complicated by differences between Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill and the Catholic Confederation which met at Kilkenny in October 1642. Phelim professed to be acting in the interest of Charles I; O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s aim was complete independence of Ireland as a Catholic country, while the Old English Catholics represented by the council desired to secure religious liberty and an Irish constitution under English rule. O&#x27;Neill wanted the Plantation of Ulster overturned and the recovery of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty&#x27;s lands. The majority of Confederate military resources were directed to Thomas Preston&#x27;s Leinster Army. Preston, an Old English Catholic, was also a Spanish veteran but he and O&#x27;Neill had an intense personal dislike of each other.

Mainly because Preston had been given the available military resources, O&#x27;Neill was outnumbered by the Scottish Covenanter army that had landed in Ulster in 1642. He did, however, have a large number of experienced officers who had travelled with him from Flanders. The Irish Ulster Army, including regiments under Rory Maguire, was poorly trained and undisciplined, so O&#x27;Neill set out to transform the army into a respectable force. Following a defeat at the Battle of Clones, O&#x27;Neill had to abandon central Ulster and was followed by thousands of refugees, fleeing the revenge of the Scottish soldiers who inflicted terrible attacks on Irish civilians, persuaded by Protestant propaganda alleging atrocities against Anglo-Scottish settlers in the rebellion of 1641. To O&#x27;Neill the devastation of Ulster made it look, &quot;not only like a desert, but like hell, if hell could exist on earth&quot;. O&#x27;Neill stopped the killings of Protestant civilians, for which he received the gratitude of many Protestant settlers. From 1642 to 1646 a stalemate existed in Ulster, which O&#x27;Neill used to train and discipline his Ulster Army. This poorly supplied force nevertheless gained a bad reputation for plundering and robbing friendly civilians around its quarters in northern Leinster and southern Ulster.

== Campaigns of 1643-45 ==
With a stalemate in Ulster following the Battle of Clones, the Confederate Supreme council ordered O&#x27;Neill and the Ulster Army to join Thomas Preston&#x27;s Leinster Army in campaigns against Royalist strongholds in the midlands. Despite the animosity between O&#x27;Neill and Preston (which often led to difficulties when they campaigned together), the campaign was successful, with several royalist strongholds in the Midlands, especially in the Counties of Meath and Westmeath being captured or destroyed. They also raided much of the area for supplies.

In one famous battle, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s army was confronted by a British force under the command of Lord Moore. According to legend, O&#x27;Neill simply went over to a cannon, took aim, and blew off Lord Moore&#x27;s head. After losing their commander, the British force retreated without a fight.

After the midlands campaign, O&#x27;Neill was ordered to return to Ulster with Lord Castlehaven to conduct offensive operations against the territory held by the Covenanters. These attacks descended into a series of skirmishes but, despite being relatively unsuccessful, provided an important experience to the troops of the Ulster Army. O&#x27;Neill was deeply irritated that Castlehaven had been put in charge of the army instead of him, especially when the campaign failed. O&#x27;Neill later accused Castlehaven of cowardice, a dispute that was brought before the Supreme Council. At one point, O&#x27;Neill even considered leaving and returning to Spanish service, but was ultimately compelled not to with the arrival of weapons and reinforcements sent by the Papacy.

O&#x27;Neill returned to Ulster, where the Ulster Army set up winter headquarters at the town of Belturbet in County Cavan. The army, now better trained and experienced than ever before, emerged a transformed force in the spring of 1646, and prepared to destroy the Covenanters.

== Battle of Benburb ==

In 1646 O&#x27;Neill, with substantial Gallowglass numbers and additionally furnished with supplies by the Papal Nuncio, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, attacked the combined Protestant Laggan Army militia and Scottish Covenanter army under Major-General Robert Monro, who had landed in Ireland in April 1642. On 5 June 1646, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, O&#x27;Neill utterly routed Monro at the Battle of Benburb, on the Blackwater killing or capturing 3,000 Scots. However, he was summoned to the south by Rinuccini, and so was unable to take advantage of the victory, and allowed Monro to remain unmolested at Carrickfergus.

Upon receiving the news of the Confederate victory, the Pope, delighted at the news of a Catholic triumph over the Protestants, sent O&#x27;Neill the sword belonging to his great uncle, the Hugh O&#x27;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who had led the rebellion against the English in the Nine Years&#x27; War. After the defeat in the conflict, he had fled Ireland during the Flight of the Earls in an attempt to gain support from Catholic powers in Continental Europe, where he died in Rome in 1616.

== Coup d&#x27;état and siege of Dublin ==
In November O&#x27;Neill and Preston attempted to besiege Dublin. On 2 November they sent an ultimatum to Ormond to admit a Catholic garrison into the town. When Ormond refused, the two generals marched to Lucan west of Dublin where they were joined by the Nuncio. With winter approaching and hearing that Parliamentarian troops had landed in Dublin, O&#x27;Neill abandoned the siege.

== Campaigns of 1647 ==
By 1647, the Confederate council was becoming increasingly concerned that the Royalist garrison in Dublin was planning to hand the city over to the Parliamentarians rather than let it fall into the hands of the Irish. For this reason, O&#x27;Neill and Preston were ordered to join forces to capture the city before any Parliamentarian forces could arrive. This was the largest army ever put together by the Confederates.

O&#x27;Neill and Preston set up camp between Lucan and Celbridge. Neither man was the overall commander, with both holding equal levels of command. However neither man trusted the other, and their personal dislike of each other led to constant argument and bickering between the two. For a month or so they could not agree on a plan of action and in this time the city was handed over to the Parliamentarians under the command of Michael Jones. The Royalist commander of Dublin, Ormond, said he &quot;preferred English rebels to Irish ones&quot;. Afterwards, both generals retreated.

O&#x27;Neill then went on the campaign throughout northern Connacht, particularly against English strongholds in County Sligo. This campaign had mixed success, but O&#x27;Neill was recalled to Leinster after Preston was defeated by the Parliamentarians near Trim, County Meath. O&#x27;Neill drove Jones and his army back to Dublin while the Leinster army regrouped.

O&#x27;Neill, who was still in northern Leinster, was again called to Preston&#x27;s aid when the Leinster army was almost destroyed by Jones at the Battle of Dungans Hill. As the remainder of Preston&#x27;s army retreated, O&#x27;Neill arrived just in time to mount a successful rearguard action and annihilated the Parliamentarian advanced guard pursuing Preston. However, with the Leinster army now severely damaged, Leinster was in a precarious position. Afterwards, O&#x27;Neill returned to southern Ulster.

== Factionalism and disillusionment ==

In March 1646 a treaty was signed between Ormond and the Catholics, which would have committed the Catholics to sending troops to aid the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. The peace terms, however, were rejected by a majority of the Irish Catholic military leaders and the Catholic clergy including the Nuncio, Rinuccini. O&#x27;Neill led his Ulster army, along with Thomas Preston&#x27;s Leinster army, in a failed attempt to take Dublin from Ormond. The Irish Confederates suffered heavy military defeats the following year at the hands of Parliamentarian forces in Ireland at Dungans Hill and Knocknanauss, leading to a moderation of their demands and a new peace deal with the Royalists. This time O&#x27;Neill was alone among the Irish generals in rejecting the peace deal and found himself isolated by the departure of the Papal Nuncio from Ireland on 23 February 1649.

So alienated was O&#x27;Neill by the terms of the peace the Confederates had made with Ormond that he refused to join the Catholic/Royalist coalition and in 1648 his Ulster army fought against other Irish Catholic armies. He made overtures for alliance to Monck, who was in command of the Parliamentarians in the north, to obtain supplies for his forces, and at one stage even tried to make a separate treaty with the English Parliament against the Royalists in Ireland.

With O&#x27;Neill aligned with the Papal Nuncio, Rinuccini had the power to excommunicate those who supported the treaty with the Royalists, at which point more than 2,000 men deserted from Preston&#x27;s Leinster Army and joined O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s forces. O&#x27;Neill later relieved Parliamentarian commander Charles Coote, who was under siege in Derry by the Covenanters, in return for a herd of 2,000 cattle.

However, upon hearing of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s landing in Ireland and the subsequent Sack of Drogheda, and failing to obtain any better terms from the Parliamentarian forces, he turned once more to Ormond and the Catholic confederates, with whom he prepared to co-operate more earnestly when Cromwell&#x27;s arrival in Ireland in August 1649 brought a war of horror.

== Death and legacy ==
O&#x27;Neill died on 6 November 1649 at the O&#x27;Reilly stronghold of Cloughoughter Castle on an island in Lough Oughter in County Cavan. One belief was that he was poisoned by a priest who was working for the English, another that he died from an illness resulting from an old wound. However, it is now widely believed that he died from complications to do with gout, which he had complained about several days before his death.

Given O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s well-known excellent defensive abilities, and immense experience in siege warfare, he could have been a serious threat to Cromwell&#x27;s invasion, and that would be reason enough to assassinate O&#x27;Neill. However, there is no evidence to support this, and it is generally accepted now that he died of gout. Under cover of night he was said to have been brought to the Franciscan abbey in Cavan town for burial. Local tradition is that he was buried at Trinity Abbey, on an island in Lough Oughter. His death was a major blow to the Irish of Ulster and was kept secret for some time.

After his death, the command of the Ulster army fell to his son Henry Roe until a replacement was found. Catholic nobles and gentry met in Ulster in March to appoint a commander to succeed O&#x27;Neill. Their choice was Heber MacMahon, Bishop of Clogher. The Ulster army was unable to prevent the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, despite a successful defence of Clonmel by O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s nephew Hugh Duff O&#x27;Neill and was destroyed at the Battle of Scarrifholis in Donegal in 1650. Its remnants continued guerrilla warfare until 1653 when they surrendered at Cloughoughter Castle in County Cavan. Most of the survivors were transported to serve in the Spanish Army.

In the 19th century, O&#x27;Neill was celebrated by the Irish nationalist revolutionaries, the Young Irelanders, as a patriot. Thomas Davis wrote a song about O&#x27;Neill, &quot;The Lament for Owen Roe&quot;, first published in the Young Ireland newspaper &quot;The Nation&quot;. Drawing on an older melody composed by the harp player Turlough Carolan, it portrays his death as an assassination and the main cause of the subsequent defeat to Cromwell&#x27;s English Republican forces. Its first verse is:

&quot;&quot;Did they dare, did they dare, to slay Owen Roe O’Neill?”&quot; 
&quot;&quot;Yes, they slew with poison him they feared to meet with steel&quot;.&quot;
&quot;&quot;May God wither up their hearts! May their blood cease to flow,&quot; 
&quot;May they walk in living death, who poisoned Owen Roe&quot;.&quot;

Tommy Makem composed a song, &quot;The Battle of Benburb&quot;, which commemorates O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 1646 victory over the Scottish Covenanters.

=== Commemoration ===
O&#x27;Neill is commemorated in the names of several Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in Northern Ireland, including (in Armagh) Eoghan Ruadh Middletown; (in Derry) CLG Eoghan Rua, Coleraine; (in Dublin) St Oliver Plunketts/Eoghan Ruadh GAA, and (in Tyrone) Brackaville Owen Roes GFC; Owen Roe O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s GAC, Leckpatrick; Eoghan Ruadh, Dungannon GAA, in Down, Kilcoo Owen Roes GAC and the defunct Benburb Eoghan Ruadh GAC

The Irish Army opened a new barracks in 1990, to replace the old military post in Cavan Town since 1707?, and named it &quot;Dún Uí Néill&quot; (O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Fort or Fort of O&#x27;Neill). A &amp; Sp companies of the 29th Infantry Battalion conducted border patrols and Aid To Civil Power operations from here. It was subsequently closed in 2012 during Irish Defence Forces restructuring.

<text>The turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) is the most widespread of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus &quot;Cathartes&quot; of the family Cathartidae, the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.

Like all New World vultures, it is not closely related to the Old World vultures of Europe, Africa, and Asia. However, the two groups strongly resemble each other due to convergent evolution.

The turkey vulture is a scavenger and feeds almost exclusively on carrion. It finds its food using its keen eyes and sense of smell, flying low enough to detect the gasses produced by the early stages of decay in dead animals. In flight, it uses thermals to move through the air, flapping its wings infrequently. It roosts in large community groups. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It nests in caves, hollow trees, or thickets. Each year it generally raises two chicks, which it feeds by regurgitation. It has very few natural predators. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.

== Names ==
It is also known in some North American regions as a &quot;buzzard&quot; or &quot;turkey buzzard&quot; and in some areas of the Caribbean as the &quot;John crow&quot; or &quot;carrion crow.&quot;

== Taxonomy ==

The turkey vulture received its common name from the resemblance of the adult&#x27;s bald red head and dark plumage to that of the male wild turkey, while the name &quot;vulture&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;vulturus&quot;, meaning &quot;tearer&quot;, and is a reference to its feeding habits. The word &quot;buzzard&quot; is used by North Americans to refer to this bird, yet in the Old World that term refers to members of the genus &quot;Buteo&quot;. The turkey vulture was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus as &quot;Vultur aura&quot; in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, and characterised as &quot;V. fuscogriseus, remigibus nigris, rostro albo&quot; (&quot;brown-gray vulture, with black wing flight feathers and a white beak&quot;). It is a member of the family Cathartidae, along with the other six species of New World vultures, and included in the genus &quot;Cathartes&quot;, along with the greater yellow-headed vulture and the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Like other New World vultures, the turkey vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.

The taxonomic placement of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Some earlier authorities suggested that the New World vultures were more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintained their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.

However, recent genetic studies indicate that neither New World nor Old World vultures are close to falcons, nor are New World vultures close to storks. Both are basal members of the clade Afroaves, with Old World vultures comprising several groups within the family Accipitridae, also containing eagles, kites, and hawks, while New World vultures in Cathartiformes are a sister group to Accipitriformes (containing the osprey and secretarybird along with Accipitridae).

There are five subspecies of turkey vulture:

== Description ==
A large bird, it has a wingspan of , a length of , and weight of . Birds in the northern limit of the species&#x27; range average larger in size than the vulture from the neotropics. 124 birds from Florida averaged while 65 and 130 birds from Venezuela were found to average , respectively. It displays minimal sexual dimorphism; sexes are identical in plumage and in coloration, and are similar in size. The body feathers are mostly brownish-black, but the flight feathers on the wings appear to be silvery-gray beneath, contrasting with the darker wing linings. The adult&#x27;s head is small in proportion to its body and is red in color with few to no feathers. It also has a relatively short, hooked, ivory-colored beak. The irises of the eyes are gray-brown; legs and feet are pink-skinned, although typically stained white. The eye has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid.


The two front toes of the foot are long and have small webs at their bases. Tracks are large, between in length and in width, both measurements including claw marks. Toes are arranged in the classic, anisodactyl pattern. The feet are flat, relatively weak, and poorly adapted to grasping; the talons are also not designed for grasping, as they are relatively blunt. In flight, the tail is long and slim. The black vulture is relatively shorter-tailed and shorter-winged, which makes it appear rather smaller in flight than the turkey vulture, although the body masses of the two species are roughly the same. The nostrils are not divided by a septum, but rather are perforate; from the side one can see through the beak. It undergoes a molt in late winter to early spring. It is a gradual molt, which lasts until early autumn. The immature bird has a gray head with a black beak tip; the colors change to those of the adult as the bird matures.

Captive longevity is not well known. , there is one captive bird over 48 years old: a male named Lord Richard that lives at the Lindsay Wildlife Experience in Walnut Creek, California. Lord Richard hatched in 1974 at Randall Museum in San Francisco and arrived at Lindsay Wildlife later that year. Another turkey vulture named Nero lived to the age of 47. Nero also hatched in 1974 and was taken from his nest for research studies at the University of Wisconsin. He later became an education ambassador at Carpenter Nature Center in Hastings, Minnesota, and in 1993 he joined the education department of the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Raptor Center. He remained their only educational vulture until his death in 2022.

The oldest wild captured banded bird was 16 years old.

Leucistic (sometimes mistakenly called &quot;albino&quot;) turkey vultures are sometimes seen.

Like most other vultures, the turkey vulture has very few vocalization capabilities. Because it lacks a syrinx, it can only utter hisses and grunts.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The turkey vulture has a large range, with an estimated global occurrence of . It is the most widely distributed vulture in the Americas and rivals its cousin the black vulture as the most abundant raptorial bird worldwide. Its global population is estimated to be 18,000,000 individuals. It is found in open and semi-open areas throughout the Americas from southern Canada to Cape Horn. It is a permanent resident in the southern United States, though northern birds may migrate as far south as South America. The turkey vulture is widespread over nearly all American habitats but they tend to show particular habitat preferences. It is most commonly found in relatively open areas which juxtapose with woodland, which are important both for nesting and roosting. Furthermore, turkey vultures in North America generally avoid enclosed forested areas that may hamper their ability to take flight and tend to often favor hill or low mountainous areas that make catching flight easier with less effort. This species can be seen over open country, including grasslands but are often absent from completely treeless areas such as some parts of the prairies or Great Plains. Additionally, they may adapt to tropical and subtropical forests, shrublands, deserts and semi-desert, wetlands and foothills. Evidence indicates agricultural land is key habitat for turkey vultures, mainly pastureland or other low-input farmland for foraging and roosting but they tend to only occur ephemerally as flyovers around row-crop type agriculture. Other manmade habitats can be used, with the species regularly seen over urban areas throughout its range, though they tend to use them more when not breeding, being unable to nest without appropriate habitats, and do not occur as an urban bird nearly as routinely as do black vultures in the tropics and subtropics.

This bird with its crow-like aspect gave foot to the naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell together with the lesser yellow-headed vulture and the black vulture.

== Ecology and behavior ==

The turkey vulture is gregarious and roosts in large community groups, breaking away to forage independently during the day. Several hundred vultures may roost communally in groups, which sometimes even include black vultures. It roosts often on dead, leafless trees as well as low-density conifers, and will also roost on man-made structures such as water or microwave towers. Though it nests in caves, it does not enter them except during the breeding season. The turkey vulture lowers its night-time body temperature by about to , becoming slightly hypothermic.

This vulture is often seen standing in a spread-winged or stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. It is practiced more often following damp or rainy nights. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, by Old World vultures, and by storks. Like storks, the turkey vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation of the water in the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs.
The turkey vulture has few natural predators and the few recorded predators appear to take them quite infrequently. Fledging, immature and adult vultures, in descending likelihood of predation, may fall prey to great horned owls, golden eagles, bald eagles and potentially red-tailed hawks, while eggs and nestlings may be preyed on by mammals such as raccoons and opossums. Foxes can occasionally ambush an adult, but species that can climb are more likely to breach and predate nests than adults, while dogs may sometimes kill a turkey vulture as well. Its primary form of defense is regurgitating semi-digested meat, a foul-smelling substance, which deters most creatures intent on raiding a vulture nest. It will also sting if the predator is close enough to get the vomit in its face or eyes. In some cases, the vulture must rid its crop of a heavy, undigested meal to take flight to flee from a potential predator. Its life expectancy in the wild ranges upward of 16 years, with a captive life span of over 45 years being possible.

The turkey vulture is awkward on the ground with an ungainly, hopping walk. It requires a great deal of effort to take flight, flapping its wings while pushing off the ground and hopping with its feet. While soaring, the turkey vulture holds its wings in a shallow V-shape and often tips from side to side, frequently causing the gray flight feathers to appear silvery as they catch the light. The flight of the turkey vulture is an example of static soaring flight, in which it flaps its wings very infrequently, and takes advantage of rising thermals to stay soaring.

=== Breeding ===
The breeding season of the turkey vulture varies according to latitude. In the southern United States, it commences in March, peaks in April to May, and continues into June. In more northerly latitudes, the season starts later and extends into August. Courtship rituals of the turkey vulture involve several individuals gathering in a circle, where they perform hopping movements around the perimeter of the circle with wings partially spread. In the air, one bird closely follows another while flapping and diving.
Eggs are generally laid in the nesting site in a protected location such as a cliff, a cave, a rock crevice, a burrow, inside a hollow tree, or in a thicket. There is little or no construction of a nest; eggs are laid on a bare surface. Females generally lay two eggs, but sometimes one and rarely three. The eggs are cream-colored, with brown or lavender spots around their larger end. Both parents incubate, and the young hatch after 30 to 40 days. Chicks are altricial, or helpless at birth. Both adults feed the chicks by regurgitating food for them, and care for them for 10 to 11 weeks. When adults are threatened while nesting, they may flee, or they may regurgitate on the intruder or feign death. If the chicks are threatened in the nest, they defend themselves by hissing and regurgitating. The young fledge at about nine to ten weeks. Family groups remain together until fall.

=== Feeding ===
The turkey vulture feeds primarily on a wide variety of carrion, from small mammals (such as mice and shrews) to large grazers (such as ungulates), preferring those recently dead, and avoiding carcasses that have reached the point of putrefaction. They may rarely feed on plant matter, shoreline vegetation, pumpkin, grape, juniper, coconut and other crops, live frogs, live insects and other invertebrates. In South America, turkey vultures have been photographed feeding on the fruits of the introduced oil palm. They rarely, if ever, kill prey themselves; when they do it tends to comprise small weak offspring or very sick individuals of various animals, such as bird eggs and nestlings, as well as reptiles. Turkey vultures have also been observed eating coyote, sea lion and domestic animal dung. The turkey vulture can often be seen along roadsides feeding on roadkill, or near bodies of water, feeding on washed-up fish. They also will feed on fish, tadpoles or insects that have become stranded in shallow water. It sometimes comes to rubbish dumps, but in general, is a rather different kind of scavenger from the black vulture. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion, which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.The turkey vulture forages by smell, an ability that is uncommon in the avian world, often flying low to the ground to pick up the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. The olfactory lobe of its brain, responsible for processing smells, is particularly large compared to that of other animals. This heightened ability to detect odors allows it to search for carrion below the forest canopy. King vultures, black vultures, and condors, which lack the ability to smell carrion, follow the turkey vulture to carcasses. The turkey vulture arrives first at the carcass, or with greater yellow-headed vultures or lesser yellow-headed vultures, which also share the ability to smell carrion. It displaces the yellow-headed vultures from carcasses due to its larger size, but is displaced in turn by the king vulture and both types of condor, which make the first cut into the skin of the dead animal. This allows the smaller, weaker-billed turkey vulture access to food, because it cannot tear the tough hides of larger animals on its own. This is an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures tend to be more aggressive and often displace turkey vultures which appear to be intimidated especially by the feeding frenzy engaged in by the black vultures when they come in numbers (a behavior turkey vultures are apparently incapable of even when at a carcass in numbers), however pairs or individuals often seem to be able to peaceably share carrion with turkey vultures. However, in the tropics such as Peru, turkey vultures appeared to prevail regularly over black vultures, in 56% of cases, perhaps due to the smaller size of the region&#x27;s black vultures. It is further subservient to large hawks such as red-tailed hawks, Harris&#x27;s hawks and &quot;Buteogallus&quot; black hawks, as well as to large falcons like peregrine falcons and crested caracaras, despite most of these birds being rather smaller in body size than a turkey vulture. Often these raptors tend to engage in dive-bombing or other intimidation displays towards the vulture(s) to displace them from carrion or from perch sites. Presumably all sympatric eagles are also dominant, with bald eagles confirmed to easily dominate turkey vultures in Florida. However, in the tropics Swainson&#x27;s hawks and yellow-headed caracara (as well as lesser yellow-headed vultures) appear to be subservient to turkey vultures. Furthermore, turkey vultures are dominant over crows at carrion, but not over common ravens.

== Relationship with humans ==

The turkey vulture is sometimes accused of carrying anthrax or hog cholera, both livestock diseases, on its feet or bill by cattle ranchers and is therefore occasionally perceived as a threat. However, the virus that causes hog cholera is destroyed when it passes through the turkey vulture&#x27;s digestive tract. This species also may be perceived as a threat by farmers due to the similar black vulture&#x27;s tendency to attack and kill newborn cattle. The turkey vulture does not kill live animals but will mix with flocks of black vultures and will scavenge what they leave behind. Nonetheless, its appearance at a location where a calf has been killed gives the incorrect impression that the turkey vulture represents a danger to calves. The droppings produced by turkey vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation. The turkey vulture can be held in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act prevents this in the case of uninjured animals or animals capable of returning to the wild. In captivity, it can be fed fresh meat, and younger birds will gorge themselves if given the opportunity.

The turkey vulture species receives special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the US it is illegal to take, kill, or possess turkey vultures, their eggs, and any body parts including but not limited to their feathers; violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 for individuals or $200,000 for organizations, and/or a prison term of 1 year. It is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30 percent in 10 years or three generations.

<doc id="194349" wikidata="Q7073216" url="?curid=194349" title="O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)">
<text>O Brother, Where Art Thou? is the soundtrack album of music from the 2000 American film of the same name, written, directed and produced by the Coen Brothers and starring George Clooney, John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Goodman.

The film is set in Mississippi during the Great Depression. The soundtrack, produced by T-Bone Burnett, uses bluegrass, country, gospel, blues, and Southern folk music appropriate to the time period. With the exception of a few vintage tracks (such as Harry McClintock&#x27;s 1928 single &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot;), most tracks are modern recordings.

The soundtrack was reissued on August 23, 2011, with 14 new tracks that were not included in the original album, &quot;including 12 previously unreleased cuts from music producer T-Bone Burnett&#x27;s &quot;O Brother&quot; sessions.&quot;

==Development and sound==
The soundtrack was conceived as a major component of the film, not merely as a background or support. For this reason it was decided to record the soundtrack before filming. T-Bone Burnett and Alan Larman were invited to design collections of music.

Dirges and other macabre songs recurring in Appalachian music, such as &quot;O Death&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Valley&quot;, &quot;Angel Band&quot;, and &quot;I Am Weary&quot;, appear in the film as a contrast to the bright, cheerful songs like &quot;Keep On the Sunnyside&quot; and &quot;In the Highways&quot;. Ralph Stanley of The Stanley Brothers personally recorded the a cappella folk song &quot;O Death&quot;.

&quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; has five variations: two are used in the film, one in the music video, and two in the album. Two of the variations feature the verses being sung back-to-back, and the other three variations feature additional music between each verse. The voices of the Soggy Bottom Boys were provided by Dan Tyminski (lead vocal on &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;), Nashville songwriter Harley Allen, and the Nashville Bluegrass Band&#x27;s Pat Enright.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 2002, the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals (for singer Dan Tyminski, whose voice overdubbed George Clooney&#x27;s in the film on &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, Nashville songwriter Harley Allen, and the Nashville Bluegrass Band&#x27;s Pat Enright), and the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for &quot;O, Death&quot; by Ralph Stanley.

The album won the Album of the Year Award (only the second soundtrack to ever do so) and Single of the Year Award for &quot;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; at the Country Music Association Awards. It also won the Album of the Year Award at the 37th Academy of Country Music Awards and took home 2 International Bluegrass Music Awards: Album of the Year and Gospel Recorded Performance of the Year (for Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch on &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;).

In 2006, the album ranked No. 38 on &quot;CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Rhapsody&quot; ranked it No. 8 on the &quot;Country&#x27;s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list. Engine 145 Country Music Blog ranked it No. 5 on the &quot;Country&#x27;s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list. In 2010, &quot;All Songs Considered&quot;, a program on NPR, included the soundtrack album on their list of &quot;The Decade&#x27;s 50 Most Important Recordings&quot;.

Some of the artists on the soundtrack album played a concert at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, which was recorded in the 2000 documentary film, &quot;Down from the Mountain&quot;.

On August 23, 2011, a 10th anniversary edition was released featuring a bonus disc with 14 new tracks that were not included in the original album, all but two of which were previously unreleased songs from Burnett&#x27;s original sessions.

==Commercial performance==

The album charted at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 In 2001, and spent over 20 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums Chart. The soundtrack CD became a best seller; it was first certified Gold by the RIAA on February 9, 2001, and reached 8 times Platinum by October 10, 2007. It has sold 8,175,800 copies in the United States as of October 2019.

== Track listing ==


The 10th Anniversary bonus disc includes five songs that were used in the movie. The bonus disc versions of &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; are the ones used in the film, not the versions on the original soundtrack album. Both the original album and the bonus disc versions of &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot;, &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot;, and &quot;Angel Band&quot; are used in the film.

The music credits for the movie list two songs, &quot;Admiration&quot; (written by William Tyers and performed by Pat Rebillo) and &quot;What Is Sweeter&quot; (written by M. K. Jerome), which are not included on either edition of the soundtrack album.

<text>The black vulture (Coragyps atratus), also known as the American black vulture, Mexican vulture, zopilote, urubu, or gallinazo, is a bird in the New World vulture family whose range extends from the southeastern United States to Peru, Central Chile and Uruguay in South America. Although a common and widespread species, it has a somewhat more restricted distribution than its compatriot, the turkey vulture, which breeds well into Canada and all the way south to Tierra del Fuego. It is the only extant member of the genus &quot;Coragyps&quot;, which is in the family Cathartidae. Despite the similar name and appearance, this species is not closely related to the Eurasian black vulture, an Old World vulture, of the family Accipitridae (which includes raptors like the eagles, hawks, kites, and harriers). For ease of locating animal corpses (their primary source of sustenance), black vultures tend to inhabit relatively open areas with scattered trees, such as chaparral, in addition to subtropical forested areas and parts of the Brazilian pantanal.

With a wingspan of , the black vulture is an imposing bird, though relatively small for a vulture, let alone a raptor. It has black plumage, a featherless, grayish-black head and neck, and a short, hooked beak. These features are all evolutionary adaptations to life as a scavenger; their black plumage stays visibly cleaner than that of a lighter-colored bird, the bare head is designed for easily digging inside animal carcasses, and the hooked beak is built for stripping the bodies clean of meat. The absence of head feathers helps the birds stay clean and remain (more or less) free of animal blood and bodily fluids, which could become problematic for the vultures and attract parasites; most vultures are known to bathe after eating, provided there is a water source. This water source can be natural or man-made, such as a stream or a livestock water tank.

The black vulture is a scavenger and feeds on carrion, but will also eat eggs, small reptiles, or small newborn animals (livestock such as cattle, or deer, rodents, rabbits, etc.), albeit very rarely. They will also opportunistically prey on extremely weakened, sick, elderly, or otherwise vulnerable animals. In areas populated by humans, it also scavenges at dumpster sites and garbage dumps. It finds its meals by using its keen eyesight or following other (New World) vultures, which all possess a keen sense of smell. Lacking a syrinx—the vocal organ of birds—its only vocalizations are grunts or low hisses. It lays its eggs in caves, in cliffside rock crevasses, dead and hollow trees, or, in the absence of predators, on the bare ground, generally raising two chicks each year. The parents feed their young by regurgitation from their crop, an additional digestive organ unique to birds, used for storing excess food; their “infant formula”, of sorts, is thus called “crop milk”. In the United States, the vulture receives legal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This vulture also appeared in Mayan codices.

==Taxonomy==
The American naturalist William Bartram wrote of the black vulture in his 1791 book &quot;Bartram&#x27;s Travels&quot;, calling it &quot;Vultur atratus&quot; &quot;black vulture&quot; or &quot;carrion crow&quot;. Bartram&#x27;s work has been rejected for nomenclatoríal purposes by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature as the author did not consistently use the system of binomial nomenclature. The German ornithologist Johann Matthäus Bechstein formally described the species using the same name in 1793 in his translation of John Latham&#x27;s &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The common name &quot;vulture&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;vulturus&quot;, which means &quot;tearer&quot; and is a reference to its feeding habits. The species name, &quot;ātrātus&quot;, means &quot;clothed in black&quot;, from the Latin &quot;āter&quot; &#x27;dull black&#x27;.

Vieillot defined the genus &quot;Catharista&quot; in 1816, listing as its type &quot;C. urubu&quot;. French naturalist Emmanuel Le Maout placed in its current genus &quot;Coragyps&quot; (as &quot;C. urubu&quot;) in 1853. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire has been listed as the author in the past, but he did not publish any official description. The genus name means &quot;raven-vulture&quot;, from a contraction of the Greek &quot;corax&quot;/κόραξ and &quot;gyps&quot;/γὺψ for the respective birds.

The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union used the name &quot;Catharista atrata&quot; initially before adopting Vieillot&#x27;s name (&quot;Catharista urubu&quot;) in their third edition. By their fourth edition, they had adopted the current name.

The black vulture is basal (the earliest offshoot) to a lineage that gave rise to the turkey vulture and greater and lesser yellow-headed vultures, diverging around 12 million years ago.

Martin Lichtenstein described &quot;C. a. foetens&quot;, the Andean black vulture, in 1817, and Charles Lucien Bonaparte described &quot;C. a. brasiliensis&quot;, from Central and South America, in 1850 on the basis of smaller size and minor plumage differences. However, it has been established that the change between the three subspecies is clinal (that is, there is no division between the subspecies), and hence they are no longer recognised.

&quot;Black vulture&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). &quot;American black vulture&quot; is also commonly used, and in 2007 the South American Classification Committee (SACC) of the American Ornithological Society unsuccessfully proposed it to be the official name of the species.

===Evolutionary history of &quot;Coragyps&quot;===
From the Early to the Late Pleistocene, a prehistoric species of black vulture, &quot;C. occidentalis&quot;, known as the Pleistocene black vulture or—somewhat in error—the &quot;western black vulture&quot;, occurred across the present species&#x27; range. This bird did not differ much from the black vulture of today except in size; it was some 10–15% larger and had a relatively flatter and wider bill. It filled a similar ecological niche as the living form but fed on larger animals, and was previously thought to have evolved into it by decreasing in size during the last ice age. However, a 2022 genetic study found &quot;C. occidentalis&quot; to be nested within the South American clade of black vultures; &quot;C. occidentalis&quot; had evolved from the modern black vulture about 400,000 years ago and developed a larger and more robust body size when it colonized high-altitude environments. &quot;C. occidentalis&quot; may have interacted with humans; a subfossil bone of the extinct species was found in a Paleo-Indian to Early Archaic (9000–8000 years BCE) midden at Five Mile Rapids near The Dalles, Oregon.

Fossil (or subfossil) black vultures cannot necessarily be attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as &quot;C. occidentalis mexicanus&quot; as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea), which constituted the nominate subspecies &quot;C. o. occidentalis&quot;. The southern birds were of the same size as present-day northern black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the Pleistocene and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the Pleistocene taxa in &quot;C. atratus&quot;, which is further affirmed by phylogenetic studies indicating that it forms a clade within the South American &quot;C. atratus&quot;.

An additional fossil species from the Late Pleistocene of Cuba, &quot;C. seductus&quot;, was described in 2020.

==Description==

The black vulture is a fairly large scavenger, measuring in length, with a wingspan. Weight for black vultures from North America and the Andes ranges from but in the smaller vultures of the tropical lowlands it is . 50 vultures in Texas were found to average while 119 birds in Venezuela were found to average . The extended wing bone measures , the shortish tail measures and the relatively long tarsus measures . Its plumage is mainly glossy black. The head and neck are featherless, and the skin is dark gray and wrinkled. The iris of the eye is brown and has a single incomplete row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. The legs are grayish-white, while the two front toes of the foot are long and have small webs at their bases.

The nostrils are not divided by a septum, but rather are perforate; one can see through the beak from the side. The wings are broad but relatively short. The bases of the primary feathers are white, producing a white patch on the underside of the wing&#x27;s edge, which is visible in flight. The tail is short and square, barely reaching past the edge of the folded wings.

A leucistic &quot;C. atratus brasiliensis&quot; was observed in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, with only the tarsus and tail and some black undertail feathers. It was not an albino as its skin seemed to have a normal, dark color, and it was part of a flock of some twenty normally plumaged individuals.

==Distribution and habitat==

The black vulture has a Nearctic and Neotropic distribution. Its range includes the mid-Atlantic States, the southernmost regions of the Midwestern United States, the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, and most of South America. It is usually a permanent resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to Peru, central Chile and Uruguay. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It is also found in moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.

==Ecology and behavior==
The black vulture soars high while searching for food, holding its wings horizontally when gliding. It flaps in short bursts, followed by short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its legs, using the evaporation of the water in the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.

Like the turkey vulture, this vulture is often seen standing in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.

===Breeding===

The timing of black vultures&#x27; breeding season varies with the latitude at which they live. In the United States, birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, while those in Ohio generally do not start before March. In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October. Some in South America breed even later than that—black vultures in Trinidad typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February. Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they strut and bob their heads. They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.

The black vulture lays its eggs on the ground in a wooded area, a hollow log, or some other cavity, seldom more than above the ground. While it generally does not use any nesting materials, it may decorate the area around the nest with bits of brightly colored plastic, shards of glass, or metal items such as bottle caps. Clutch size is generally two eggs, though this can vary from one to three. The egg is oval and, on average, measures . The smooth, gray-green, bluish, or white shell is variably blotched or spotted with lavender or pale brown around the larger end. Both parents incubate the eggs, which hatch after 28 to 41 days. Upon hatching, the young are covered with a buffy down, unlike turkey vulture chicks which are white. Both parents feed the nestlings, regurgitating food at the nest site. The young remain in the nest for two months, and after 75 to 80 days, they can fly skillfully. Predation of black vultures is relatively unlikely, though eggs and nestlings are readily eaten if found by mammalian predators such as raccoons, coatis and foxes. Due to its aggressiveness and size, few predators can threaten the fully-grown vulture. However, various eagles may kill vultures in conflicts, and even the ornate hawk-eagle, a slightly smaller bird than the vulture, has preyed on adult black vultures, as well as the two eagles native to North America (north of Mexico).

===Feeding===

The black vulture eats mainly carrion in natural settings. In areas populated by humans, it may scavenge at garbage dumps for refuse, offal, and other discarded edible waste, but also takes eggs, fruit (both ripe and rotting), fish, dung and ripe/decomposing plant material and can kill or injure newborn or incapacitated mammals. Like other vultures, it plays an important role in the ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease. The black vulture locates food either by sight or by following New World vultures of the genus &quot;Cathartes&quot; to carcasses. These vultures—the turkey vulture, the lesser yellow-headed vulture, and the greater yellow-headed vulture—forage by detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. Their heightened ability to detect odors allows them to search for carrion below the forest canopy. The black vulture is aggressive when feeding and may chase the slightly larger turkey vulture from carcasses.

The black vulture also occasionally feeds on livestock or deer. It is the only species of New World vulture which preys on cattle. It occasionally harasses cows giving birth, but primarily preys on newborn calves, lambs, and piglets. In its first few weeks, a calf will allow vultures to approach it. The vultures swarm the calf in a group and then peck at the calf&#x27;s eyes, nose, or tongue. The calf then goes into shock and is killed by the vultures.

Black vultures have sometimes been observed removing and eating ticks from resting capybaras and Baird&#x27;s tapir (&quot;Tapirus bairdii&quot;). These vultures are known to kill baby herons and seabirds on nesting colonies, and feed on domestic ducks, small birds, skunks, opossums, other small mammals, lizards, small snakes, young turtles and insects. Like other birds with scavenging habits, the black vulture presents resistance to pathogenic microorganisms and their toxins. Many mechanisms may explain this resistance. Anti-microbial agents may be secreted by the liver or gastric epithelium, or produced by microorganisms of the normal microbiota of the species.

==Legal protections==
It receives special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures without a permit and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.

==Relationship with humans==

The black vulture is considered a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle. The droppings produced by black vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation. As a defense, the vultures also “regurgitate a reeking and corrosive vomit.&quot;

The bird can be a threat to the safety of aerial traffic, especially when it congregates in large numbers in the vicinity of garbage dumps—as is the case in the Rio de Janeiro Tom Jobim International Airport.

The black vulture can be held in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this in the case of animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild.

==In popular culture==
The black vulture appears in a variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is normally connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture&#x27;s glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture&#x27;s open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture&#x27;s knob and are painted black.

Black vultures are an important cultural symbol in Lima, Peru.

This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Suriname in 1990 and Nicaragua in 1994.

<text>Antonia Coello Novello (born August 23, 1944) is a Puerto Rican physician and public health administrator. She was a vice admiral in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and served as 14th Surgeon General of the United States from 1990 to 1993. Novello was the first woman and first Hispanic to serve as Surgeon General. Novello also served as Commissioner of Health for the State of New York from 1999 to 2006. Novello has received numerous awards including more than fifty honorary degrees, was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2000, and has been inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Her memoir, &quot;Duty Calls: Lessons Learned from an Unexpected Life of Service&quot;, was published in 2024. 

==Early life==
Antonia Novello, born on August 23, 1944, in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, was the oldest of two children; she also had a half-brother. After her divorce, her mother, Ana Delia Flores, remarried. Novello did not know her father. At birth, Novello was diagnosed with congenital megacolon, a condition that required Novello to spend two weeks every summer in the hospital. Although Novello was told at eight years old that she should have surgery to correct her problem, it would take another ten years before such an operation would happen. Nevertheless, Novello managed to excel in her study to become a doctor. Her experience with that disease, left such an impact on her that she vowed to become a doctor so that &quot;no other person is going to wait 18 years for surgery.&quot;

== Education ==
At an early age, Novello&#x27;s mother, a school teacher and later high school principal, stressed the importance of an education. Novello excelled in her education and graduated from high school at the age of 15. She attended the University of Puerto Rico in Rio Piedras where she received her Bachelor of Science degree in 1965. She went on to the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine in San Juan where she received her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1970. That same year, she married Joseph R. Novello and they both moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where she continued her medical studies. Novello began a pediatric internship at University of Michigan Medical School. She became the first woman to receive the &quot;University of Michigan Pediatrics Department Intern of the Year&quot; award. In 1973, Novello and her husband moved to Washington D.C. to begin her residency in pediatric nephrology at Georgetown University School of Medicine Hospital until 1976. She earned her Masters in Public Health from Johns Hopkins University in 1982 and her Doctorate in Public Health also from Johns Hopkins in 2000.

==Career==

=== Pediatric nephrologist ===
In 1976, Novello opened her own private practice in Springfield, Virginia, where she worked as a pediatrician. However, she soon realized that she lacked adequate emotional detachment for her work so she terminated her practice. Novello stated in an interview, &quot;When the pediatrician cries as much as the parents do, then you know it&#x27;s time to get out.&quot;

===Public Health Service===
In 1979, Novello joined the Public Health Service and received a commission in the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC). Her first assignment was as a project officer at the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism and Digestive Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). From 1976, she also held a clinical appointment in pediatrics at Georgetown University School of Medicine. During her years at NIH, Novello worked on an MPH degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, receiving the degree in 1982.

Novello held various positions at NIH before being appointed to Assistant Surgeon General grade in the PHSCC and assignment as the deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in 1986. She also served as Coordinator for AIDS Research for NICHD from September 1987. In this role, she developed a particular interest in pediatric AIDS, which caught the attention of the White House.

Novello made major contributions to the drafting and enactment of the Organ Transplantation Procurement Act of 1984 while assigned to the United States Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, working with the staff of committee chairman Orrin Hatch.

===Surgeon General===
Novello was appointed Surgeon General by President George H. W. Bush, beginning her tenure on March 9, 1990, and was appointed to the temporary rank of vice admiral in the regular corps while the Surgeon General. She was the first woman and the first Hispanic to hold the position.

During her tenure as Surgeon General, Novello focused her attention on the health of women, children and minorities, as well as on underage drinking, smoking, and AIDS. She played an important role in launching the Healthy Children Ready to Learn Initiative. She was actively involved in working with other organizations to promote immunization of children and childhood injury prevention efforts. She spoke out often and forcefully about illegal underage drinking, and called upon the United States Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General to issue a series of reports on the subject.

Novello also worked to discourage illegal tobacco use by young people, and repeatedly criticized the tobacco industry for appealing to the youth market through the use of cartoon characters such as Joe Camel. A workshop that she convened led to the emergence of a National Hispanic/Latino Health Initiative.

Novello was controversial among abortion rights advocates due to her support of a policy prohibiting family planning program workers who received federal financing from discussing abortion with their patients.

Novello left the post of Surgeon General on June 30, 1993, with the administration of President Bill Clinton praising her for her &quot;vigor and talent.&quot;

===Later years===
After leaving the position of Surgeon General, Novello remained in the regular corps of the Public Health Service. She was assigned to the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) as Special Representative for Health and Nutrition from 1993 to 1996 reverting to her permanent two-star rank of rear admiral. In 1996, she became visiting professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. She retired from the Public Health Service and the PHSCC shortly after with the grade of vice admiral.

In 1999, Governor of New York George Pataki appointed Novello as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. She served until 2006.

From 2008 to 2014, Novello was vice president of Women and Children Health and Policy Affairs at Disney Children&#x27;s Hospital at Florida Hospital in Orlando, Florida.

On June 26, 2009, in a plea deal with prosecutors, Novello pleaded guilty to one felony count of filing a false instrument involving a worker&#x27;s duties. Her guilty plea was accepted by the court on August 13, 2009. She was sentenced to pay $22,500 in restitution, a $5,000 fine, and spend 250 hours doing community service at a medical clinic for uninsured patients. Outside the court immediately after the sentencing, her lawyer called the crime an &quot;administrative processing offense – nothing else.&quot; On March 31, 2022, by order of the Albany County Court, Judge Roger D. McDonough, the records were sealed.

As of December 31, 2014, Novello retired from her position as an executive director of public health policy at Florida Hospital - Orlando.

<text>Albert Samuel Anker (1 April 1831 – 16 July 1910) was a Swiss painter and illustrator who has been called the &quot;national painter&quot; of Switzerland because of his enduringly popular depictions of 19th-century Swiss social life.

==Life==

Born in Ins as the son of veterinarian Samuel Anker (then a member of the constituent assembly of the Canton of Bern) and Marianne Elisabeth (born Gatschet). In 1836 his father became veterinarian in Neuchâtel, and the Anker family moved there. Anker attended school in Neuchâtel, where his teacher in sketching was Frédéric-Wilhelm Moritz. He and Auguste Bachelin, later a fellow artist, took private drawing lessons with Louis Wallinger from 1845 to 1848. In 1849 he enrolled into a Gymnasium in Bern, graduating with the &quot;Matura&quot; in 1851&quot;.&quot; Afterwards, he studied theology, beginning in 1851 at the University of Bern and continuing at the University of Halle, Germany. But in Germany he was inspired by the great art collections, and in 1854 he convinced his father to agree to an artistic career. In Neuchâtel he began using the name Albert, because it was easier to pronounce for his French-speaking classmates.
Anker moved to Paris, where he studied with Charles Gleyre and attended the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in 1855–60. He installed a studio in the attic of his parents&#x27; house and participated regularly in exhibitions in Switzerland and in Paris. Anker married Anna Rüfli in 1864, and they had six children together; the four children who did not die at an early age – Louise, Marie, Maurice and Cécile – appear in some of Anker&#x27;s paintings. In 1866, he was awarded a gold medal at the Paris Salon for &quot;Schlafendes Mädchen im Walde&quot; (1865) und &quot;Schreibunterricht&quot; (1865); in 1878 he was made a knight of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1870–74 he was a member of the Grand Council of Bern, where he advocated the construction of the Kunstmuseum Bern.

Apart from his regular wintertime stays in Paris, Anker frequently travelled to Italy and other European countries. In 1889–93 and 1895–98 he was a member of the Swiss Federal Art Commission and in 1900 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bern. A stroke in 1901 reduced his ability to work. Only after his death in 1910 was there a first exposition dedicated to him, held at the Musée d&#x27;art et d&#x27;histoire in Neuchâtel.

==Works==

During his studies, Anker produced a series of works with historical and biblical themes, including paintings of Luther and Calvin. Soon after returning to Ins, though, he turned to what would become his signature theme: the everyday life of people in rural communities. His paintings depict his fellow citizens in an unpretentious and plain manner, without idealising country life, but also without the critical examination of social conditions that can be found in the works of contemporaries such as Daumier, Courbet or Millet. Although Anker did paint occasional scenes with a social significance, such as visits by usurers or charlatans to the village, his affirmative and idealistic Christian world-view did not include an inclination to issue any sort of overt challenge.

Also prominent in Anker&#x27;s work are the more than 30 still lifes he created. They depict both rural and urban table settings in the tradition of Chardin, their realist solidity reflecting Anker&#x27;s vision of a harmonic and stable world order. In addition, Anker created hundreds of commissioned watercolours and drawings, mostly portraits and illustrations, including for an edition of Jeremias Gotthelf&#x27;s collected works. Between 1866, the year Anker settled to Paris and 1892, Anker also decorated more than 500 faience plates for the Alsatian pottery industrial Théodore Deck.

Anker was quick to reach his artistic objectives and never strayed from his chosen path. His works, though, exude a sense of conciliation and understanding as well as a calm trust in Swiss democracy; they are executed with great skill, providing brilliance to everyday scenes through subtle choices in colouring and lighting. Their parochial motives belie the open-mindedness towards contemporary European art and events that Anker&#x27;s correspondence reflects.

==Reception==
Albert Anker&#x27;s work made him Switzerland&#x27;s most popular genre painter of the 19th century, and his paintings have continued to enjoy a great popularity due to their general accessibility. Indeed, as a student, Anker summed up his approach to art as follows: &quot;One has to shape an idea in one&#x27;s imagination, and then one has to make that idea accessible to the people.&quot;

Many Swiss postage stamps and other media have incorporated Anker&#x27;s work. His studio in Ins has been preserved as a museum by the Albert Anker Foundation. One of Anker&#x27;s greatest admirers and collectors is former Swiss Federal Councillor Christoph Blocher, since the 1980s Switzerland&#x27;s most influential conservative politician, who also published an apologetic essay on Anker.

== Personal life ==
His brother Rudolf and his mother both died in 1847, when Anker was in Neuchâtel. His younger sister Louise died in 1852.

<doc id="194354" wikidata="Q904002" url="?curid=194354" title="Breathe (Faith Hill album)">
<text>Breathe is the fourth studio album by American country music artist Faith Hill, released November 9, 1999, via Warner Bros. Nashville. The album is one of the most successful country pop albums of all time and Hill&#x27;s best selling album to date, being certified certified 8× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The album became her most successful record to date, debuting atop both the Billboard 200 and the Top Country Albums chart and becoming the second most successful album of 2000 on the latter chart. &quot;Breathe&quot; additionally became a top 40 album in ten countries internationally. The album also contains her most successful singles on both the pop and country charts, the title track, and &quot;The Way You Love Me&quot;, with the two spending ten weeks combined at number one on the Hot Country Songs chart and peaking at numbers two and six on the all-genre &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Breathe&quot; becoming the number one song of 2000 on the Hot 100. The album also spawned the country top ten hits &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot; (a duet with her husband Tim McGraw) and &quot;If My Heart Had Wings&quot;, with the former peaking at number six and the latter at number three. Several album tracks also charted solely on unsolicited airplay. The album includes a cover version of Bette Midler&#x27;s 1998 song &quot;That&#x27;s How Love Moves&quot;.

== Singles ==
&quot;Breathe&quot;, the title track, was released as the lead single from the album on October 4, 1999. The song received highly positive reviews upon its release, with praise being directed towards Hill&#x27;s vocals. The song itself became a massive success in the United States, spending six weeks atop the Hot Country Songs chart (her longest run to date with a solo song) and spending five weeks at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100; despite never going number one on that chart, &quot;Breathe&quot; became one of only four songs in Hot 100 history to be the number one song on the Billboard Year-End chart without ever topping the weekly Hot 100, becoming the number one song of 2000. The song also held a 17 week run on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart. Internationally, the song reached the top forty in Finland, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. The song was later re-issued and remixed in October 2001 as the second and final single from her international-only compilation album &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; (2001).

&quot;The Way You Love Me&quot; was released on February 14, 2000, as the second single from the record. The song also received positive reviews. Initially released solely to country radio where it spent a four week reign atop the Hot Country Songs, the song was later issued to pop radio on August 25. The song itself also became a commercial success, peaking at number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and going on to spend 56 weeks on the chart, Hill&#x27;s longest running single to date and her second consecutive to spend more than a year on the chart following the title track. Internationally, the song gave Hill her most successful single at the time, reaching the top ten in Hungary and Spain, the top twenty in the UK, and the top forty in Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden, and Ireland, which lead the single to reach number 43 on the Eurochart Hot 100 chart, her then-highest peak. 

&quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot;, a duet with her husband Tim McGraw, was released on May 12, 2000, to country radio as the third single. Before its release, the song charted for 20 weeks as an album track solely off unsolicited airplay, reaching as high as number 52. After its release, the song became a success, peaking at number six on the Hot Country Songs chart and number five on the RPM Canadian Country Tracks chart, with the song spending 45 weeks on the latter chart.

The album&#x27;s fourth and final single, &quot;If My Heart Had Wings&quot;, was released on January 8, 2001. Debuting on the country charts the week of January 13, 2001, the song rose to as high as number three, giving Hill another commercial success. The song also went on to peak at number 39 on the Hot 100.

=== Other songs ===
Despite not being singles, some songs from &quot;Breathe&quot; charted solely off unsolicited airplay. &quot;It Will Be Me&quot; and &quot;If I&#x27;m Not In Love&quot; both charted on November 27, 1999 on the Hot Country Songs (previously known as Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks) for one week, peaking at numbers 68 and 74.

<doc id="194360" wikidata="Q756288" url="?curid=194360" title="Beauty and the Beat (The Go-Go's album)">
<text>Beauty and the Beat is the debut album from California new wave band the Go-Go&#x27;s. Released July 14, 1981 on the I.R.S. Records label, the album reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top LPs &amp; Tape chart in March 1982, bolstered by its two big Hot 100 hit singles: &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; (no. 20) and &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; (no. 2), released in 1980, but in a different version. After a long and steady climb, &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; reached number one in the album chart dated March 6, 1982, the week before &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; entered the Top Ten of the Hot 100. The album stayed at the top for six consecutive weeks, and ranked second in &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s year-end Top 100 of 1982 (behind the self-titled debut album of Asia). The album sold in excess of two million copies, and was RIAA-certified double platinum, qualifying it as one of the most successful debut albums of all time. Critically acclaimed, it has been described as one of the &quot;cornerstone albums of American new wave&quot;.

The title is a play on the European fairy tale &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

==Background==
In the late 1970s, Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, and Margot Olavarria met while attending punk rock shows in California. The three attended the Sex Pistols&#x27; final performance in San Francisco in January 1978, and afterwards were inspired to form their own band. Although none of them actually knew how to play instruments, they quickly learned, and began playing in Hollywood nightclubs under the name the Go-Go&#x27;s. Carlisle was the singer, Wiedlin played rhythm guitar, Olavarria played bass and the newly added Elissa Bello played drums. A few months later, Charlotte Caffey joined the band as the lead guitarist since she had experience writing music with other groups like the Eyes. The Go-Go&#x27;s developed a reputation within the Hollywood punk scene and were invited to open for the band Madness on a UK tour. While on tour, the Go-Go&#x27;s recorded an extended play for Stiff Records.

Tensions between band members resulted in Bello and Olavarria leaving the Go-Go&#x27;s and they were replaced by drummer Gina Schock and bassist Kathy Valentine. Around this time, the Go-Go&#x27;s began to move toward a more pop rock-driven sound, influenced by the burgeoning new wave genre. Although their reputation continued to grow, they were unable to attract attention from major record labels. At a special showcase for A&amp;R representatives at the Starwood, the Go-Go&#x27;s didn&#x27;t get a single offer. Carlisle believes this was because record executives were sexist and did not want to sign an all-female band. The only label that expressed interest was the indie label I.R.S. Records. In a 1982 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Valentine said: &quot;IRS was where you went if you couldn&#x27;t get a deal with a real label.&quot; On April 1, 1981, I.R.S. cofounder Miles Copeland III signed the Go-Go&#x27;s.

In the Go-Go&#x27;s documentary, Carlisle claimed to have come up with the idea for the album cover, saying she wanted something &quot;timeless&quot; and &quot;incognito.&quot; The towels the band used for the shoot were returned to the Macy&#x27;s they were bought from earlier that day. Initially the album was released with a peach colored cover but the band was displeased with the look and later pressings were released with a blue cover. 

== Reception ==
&quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; was released to positive reviews that preceded its eventual summit of the album charts. Robert Christgau found the album good and wrote &quot;this one&#x27;s got hooks&quot; in his column in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, while Jon Pareles in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it a &quot;solid, likable debut&quot;. The album placed 10th on the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; for 1981.

The album has since gained in regard. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; &quot;one of the cornerstone albums of new wave&quot; and praised its &quot;catchy hooks and an exuberant sense of fun&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Warren Zanes wrote that the band &quot;showed that elemental pop rock &amp; roll remained as viable as ever.&quot;

Eric Allen of &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, reviewing the album&#x27;s 2011 deluxe edition, wrote that &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; is &quot;one of the 1980s cornerstone albums of American new wave&quot; and &quot;still holds up surprisingly well thirty years later, which is a testament to the energetic spirit captured in this musical zeitgeist of the 80s&quot;; on the other hand, it is also &quot;a reminder that the Go-Go&#x27;s were never able to equal or surpass the success of this landmark debut&quot;.

NPR Music″s Hilary Hughes credited the quintet with perfecting pop-punk&#x27;s formula through the album. Though she saw that bands like Blondie and the Ramones showed that pop and punk music &quot;[weren&#x27;t] mortal enemies&quot;, she claimed that the Go-Go&#x27;s showed the &quot;certifiable success&quot; of the two&#x27;s fusion.

&quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Emily Fagen rated 4 songs on the album as being among the Go-Go&#x27;s best – the two hit singles plus &quot;Lust to Love&quot; and &quot;How Much More&quot;.

&quot;When I was about seven, I discovered the Go-Go&#x27;s,&quot; said American actress and author Drew Barrymore in an essay published by the magazine &quot;V&quot;. &quot;I went out and bought their album &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; and, as the vinyl twirled, my whole world changed. I stared at the girls on the cover like they were a gateway to cool. The fact that they were girls made me feel not only invited but more important – like I could be a badass too. I looked over to my Pippi Longstocking poster on the wall and thought, Yes! I like girls who rock!&quot;

=== Legacy ===
In 2003, &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; was ranked number 413 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and it later placed on updates of the list at number 414 (in 2012) and at number 400 (in 2020). The album opener, &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, has been covered over the years by numerous artists, and remains a staple of 1980s playlists. It appeared in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2000 list of the 100 greatest pop songs. &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; was named one of the &quot;500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot; by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Capitol and I.R.S. released a 30th anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;Beauty and the Beat&quot; digitally and on CD on May 17, 2011. Disc one features the remastered original album while disc two contains an entire live show, recorded at the Metro Club in Boston on August 20, 1981. Both &quot;Vacation&quot; (1982) and &quot;Talk Show&quot; (1984) were previously issued in remastered CD form in 1999.

In 2016, Edsel Records reissued remastered deluxe editions, all with bonus tracks, of the Go-Go&#x27;s original three releases.

<doc id="194367" wikidata="Q270690" url="?curid=194367" title="Appetite for Destruction">
<text>Appetite for Destruction is the debut studio album by American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, released on July 21, 1987, by Geffen Records. It initially received little mainstream attention, and it was not until the following year that &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; became a commercial success, after the band had toured and received significant airplay with the singles &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;. The album went on to peak at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it became the seventh best-selling album of all time in the United States, as well as the best-selling debut album in the country. With over 30 million copies sold, it is also one of the best-selling albums worldwide.

Although critics were originally ambivalent toward the album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; has received retrospective acclaim and been viewed as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set to similar universal acclaim.

==Background==
Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985, shortly after the band formed, with &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, a cover of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, &quot;Think About You&quot; and &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. However, plans for the release fell through, as original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band, being replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, the classic lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler, and Izzy Stradlin was finalized.

After heavy touring of the Los Angeles club scene, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December of that year, the group released the four-song EP &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;, which was designed to keep interest in the band alive while the group withdrew from the club scene to work in the studio. The EP release was also designed to soothe the label, which believed the band did not have enough songs to record a full-length album.

==Writing and recording==
Rose stated many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that were ultimately featured on later Guns N&#x27; Roses albums were considered for &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, such as &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot;, &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;, &quot;November Rain&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. It is said that the reason for not putting &quot;November Rain&quot; on &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; was that the band had already agreed to put &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; on the album, and thus already had a &quot;ballad&quot; on the track list.

Producer Spencer Proffer was hired to record &quot;Nightrain&quot; and &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; to test his chemistry with the band. The band eventually recorded nine songs with Proffer during these sessions, including &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, and &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot;. In mid- to late-1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018 (see below for more info). The band initially considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler&#x27;s drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange was also considered, but the label didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; first with Clink as a test.

After some weeks of rehearsal, the band entered Daryl Dragon&#x27;s Rumbo Recorders in January 1987. Two weeks were spent recording basic tracks, with Clink splicing together the best takes with his razor blade. Clink worked eighteen-hour days for the next month, with Slash overdubbing in the afternoon and evening, and Rose performing vocals. Slash struggled to find a guitar sound, before coming up with a Gibson Les Paul copy equipped with Seymour Duncan Alnico II pickups and plugged into a Marshall amplifier. He spent hours with Clink paring down and structuring his solos. The total budget for the album was about $370,000. According to drummer Steven Adler, the percussion was done in just six days, but Rose&#x27;s vocals took much longer, as he insisted on doing them one line at a time, and Rose&#x27;s perfectionism drove the rest of the band away from the studio as he worked. Final overdubs and mixing were done at Mediasound Studios, and mastering at Sterling Sound in New York City.

Many of the songs on &quot;Appetite For Destruction&quot; began as solo tracks that individual band members began separately from the band, only to be completed later. These songs include &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; (Duff McKagan) and &quot;Think About You&quot; (Izzy Stradlin). &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; was an unfinished Slash/McKagan/Adler song from their earlier band Road Crew, and &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, written by Hollywood Rose and included on their compilation album &quot;The Roots of Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;, was re-written for &quot;Appetite&quot;. Most of the songs reflect the band&#x27;s personal experiences and daily life, such as &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, some of the lyrics of which Rose wrote after he encountered a man in New York shortly after arriving there from Indiana in 1980, and &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;, which is about the band&#x27;s problems with heroin. Lyrics to some of the songs focus on the band members&#x27; younger years, like &quot;Out ta Get Me&quot;, which focuses on lead singer Axl Rose&#x27;s constant trouble with the law as a youth in Indiana.

In 1999, Rose decided to re-record the album with the then current lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed, and Chris Pitman) to &quot;spruce up&quot; the album with new recording techniques. This re-recorded version of the album was never released, although the second half of the re-recorded version of &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; can be heard (following the first half of a live performance of the song) during the end credits of the 1999 film &quot;Big Daddy&quot;.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s original cover art was based on Robert Williams&#x27; painting &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. It depicted a robotic rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. After several music retailers refused to stock the album, some Geffen executives compromised and put the controversial cover art inside, replacing it with an image depicting a Celtic cross and skulls representing each of the five band members (top skull: Izzy Stradlin, left skull: Steven Adler, center skull: Axl Rose, right skull: Duff McKagan, and bottom skull: Slash). In a 2016 interview, Billy White Jr., who designed the tattoo with the cross and skulls upon which the album artwork was based, explained: &quot;The cross and skulls that looked like the band was Axl&#x27;s idea, the rest was me. The knot work in the cross was a reference to Thin Lizzy, a band Axl and I both loved.&quot; The original cover was supposed to be on the 2008 vinyl reissue of the album, though executives replaced it with the &quot;skulls&quot; art at the last minute. The photographs used for the back of the album and liner notes were taken by Robert John, Marc Canter, Jack Lue, Leonard McCardie, and Greg Freeman.

The band stated the original artwork was &quot;a symbolic social statement, with the robot representing the industrial system that&#x27;s raping and polluting our environment.&quot; In albums which were issued on double sided media (vinyl records and audio cassettes), the two sides were labeled &quot;G&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, rather than the conventional &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Tracks 1–6, which compose side &quot;G&quot;, all deal with drugs and hard life in the big city (&quot;Guns&quot; side). The remaining tracks, which compose side &quot;R&quot;, all deal with love, sex, and relationships (&quot;Roses&quot; side). In an interview with &quot;That Metal Show&quot; in 2011, Rose stated his initial idea was for the cover art to be the photo of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; exploding that was on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1986, but Geffen rejected the idea, saying it was &quot;in bad taste&quot;.

==Marketing and sales==

When &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; was released by Geffen Records on July 21, 1987, it received little notice from American press and radio, apart from some airplay in California. Music journalist Stephen Davis later attributed this to competing rock music in the mainstream at the time, including Aerosmith&#x27;s comeback hit album &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, Def Leppard&#x27;s presence on radio with their &quot;Hysteria&quot; album, and the dominance of U2&#x27;s spiritual rock over MTV&#x27;s prime-time viewership. The album debuted at number 182 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the week of August 29, but it only sold 200,000 copies in the first several months of its release, and Geffen planned on &quot;walking away&quot; from the record.

Radio stations originally did not want to play &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, and MTV did not want to air the song&#x27;s music video. However, after several months of lobbying the network, Geffen general manager Al Coury convinced MTV to play the video just once a night for three nights. &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; became the most requested video on the network, and Coury pitched this success to radio stations, whom he sent promo copies of &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;.

With the radio and video airplay, as well as the band&#x27;s touring, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; managed to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on August 6, 1988, over a year after it was released. It spent four non-consecutive weeks at number one and a total of 147 weeks on the chart. Slash recalled: &quot;We thought we&#x27;d made a record that might do as well as, say, Motörhead. It was totally uncommercial. It took a year for it to even get on the charts. No one wanted to know about it.&quot;

From 1994 up to 2018, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; sold 1,216,017 copies in the United Kingdom.

By September 2008, the album had been certified 18× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), having shipped over 18 million copies in the United States, making it the country&#x27;s 11th best-selling album ever. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; in 2008, it is also the best-selling debut album of all time in the US. That year, Sky News reported the album&#x27;s worldwide sales to be approximately 28 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time; more recent figures have worldwide sales at approximately 30 million units.

==Reception and legacy==

The album was not well received by contemporary American critics, many of whom complained that its massive success with consumers was fostered by the taboo of &quot;sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll&quot; during the 1980s, when much of the cultural atmosphere in the US became informed by the Reagan-Bush Administration, the AIDS crisis, and the popularity of MTV. Writing in 1987, Dave Ling of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; dismissed the album as an inferior mix of elements from bands such as Aerosmith, Hanoi Rocks, and AC/DC. Critics in England were more positive, and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; claimed that &quot;rock is at last being wrestled from the hands of the bland, the weak, the jaded, the tired, the worn, and being thrust back into the hands of the real raunch rebels.&quot; However, the album was voted the 26th best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1988 Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. Robert Christgau, the poll&#x27;s supervisor, was qualified in his praise when reviewing the album for his 1990 book &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot;. While applauding Rose&#x27;s &quot;effortless, convincing vocal abilities&quot; as &quot;undeniable and [setting] him apart from his contemporaries&quot;, the journalist found his performance undermined by questionable lyrics that reveal darker ideas: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t love &#x27;Night Train&#x27;, he loves alcoholism. And once that sweet child o&#x27; his proves her devotion by sucking his cock for the portacam, the evil slut is ready for &#x27;See me hit you you fall down.&#x27;&quot;

In a retrospective review for &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Ann Powers wrote that Guns N&#x27; Roses &quot;produced a unique mix of different rock values&quot;, such as &quot;speed and musicianship, flash and dirt&quot;, on an album that &quot;changed hard rock&#x27;s sensibilities at the time.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine also viewed the album as a &quot;turning point for hard rock&quot; in his review for AllMusic, and felt Rose&#x27;s singing and songwriting were enhanced by Slash and Stradlin&#x27;s dual guitar playing, which helped make &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; &quot;the best metal record of the late &#x27;80s&quot;. According to Jimmy Martin of &quot;The Quietus&quot;, the album, which he called &quot;the greatest hard rock record of the 80s&quot;, has an &quot;unrefined, punk quality&quot; that marked a &quot;shift away&quot; from the hair metal bands commercialized by MTV. Christa Titus of &quot;Billboard&quot; said &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; was able to appeal to various rock music listeners because, on it, Guns N&#x27; Roses incorporated &quot;metal&#x27;s forceful playing, punk rock&#x27;s rebellious themes, glam metal&#x27;s aesthetic, and bluesy guitar riffs that appealed to purists.&quot; Russell Hall, the features writer for Gibson&#x27;s online publication, said the album &quot;injected a much-needed dose of &#x27;70s-style rebellion into the frothy pop metal of the &#x27;80s&quot;, by &quot;combining the swagger of late &#x27;60s Stones and vintage Aerosmith with the menace of punk and a trash-glam aesthetic&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Maura Johnston called the album &quot;a watershed moment in &#x27;80s rock that chronicled every vice of Los Angeles led by the lye-voiced Axl Rose and a legendary, switchblade-sharp band.&quot; BBC Music&#x27;s Dennis O&#x27;Dell said the engagingly hedonistic album remains the band&#x27;s best, as did Ric Albano of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine: &quot;This band would never again reach this level of importance and breakthrough originality.&quot; In a 2000 list, &quot;Q&quot; named it one of the greatest metal albums ever and hailed it as &quot;a riotous celebration of sex, drugs and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot;. Chuck Klosterman said the album would be the only pop metal album to make a theoretical list of rock&#x27;s ten best albums, and Chuck Eddy, who called it &quot;the greatest album ever made about how you can&#x27;t run away from yourself&quot;, named it one of his essential hair metal records in &quot;Spin&quot;. On the other hand, Sputnikmusic said the album has been somewhat overrated, and most of the songs suffer by comparison to the highlights &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot;, &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;, and &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;.

===Original release===

==Remastered version==
On April 30, 2018, billboards appeared in several large cities and a website was launched with the tagline &quot;Destruction Is Coming&quot;. The website was updated with a countdown clock to May 4, 2018, and a snippet of the Hollywood Rose song &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; playing. Journalist Mitch Lafon stated the campaign was for a deluxe edition of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;. A video announcement was inadvertently released a day early, detailing the &quot;Appetite for Destruction: Locked N″ Loaded&quot; edition, which was released June 29, 2018. The box set includes 73 songs (49 of which were previously unreleased) on four compact discs and seven 12-inch 180-gram LPs. It features remastered versions of &quot;Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide&quot;, an EP of b-sides, 25 recordings from the group&#x27;s 1986 Sound City Studios sessions with producer Manny Charlton, and two previously unreleased tracks from the group&#x27;s sessions with Mike Clink. Three of the four songs from the &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot; EP are included, with the exception of the controversial &quot;One in a Million&quot;.

In addition to the music, this release included a 96-page book with unreleased photos from Rose&#x27;s personal archive, 12 lithographs visualizing each song on the album, and assorted replica memorabilia. &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot; was released as a single on May 4, 2018, making it the band&#x27;s first single in almost a decade. The full Locked N&#x27; Loaded edition initially retailed for $999, but an edition that included the five discs and extras and standard editions with just the remastered album and bonus tracks were also made available. The Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions were also made available for streaming and paid download.

On May 21, 2018, the band released the unseen music video for &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; on Apple Music. &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; (1986 Sound City Session), &quot;Move to the City&quot; (1988 Acoustic Version), and &quot;November Rain&quot; (Piano Version, 1986 Sound City Session) were released as promotional singles in June, before the album&#x27;s release. A hidden tape of the band&#x27;s five-song 1985 Mystic Studios demo session is included as an easter egg in one of the drawers of the Locked N&#x27; Loaded edition.

A Pop-up shop was opened in London on the day of release, featuring Guns N&#x27; Roses themed drinks, a tattoo artist, merchandise, and a large screen showing the band&#x27;s 1988 show at The Ritz.
The remastered release resulted in &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; re-entering the top 10 of the Billboard 200 for the first time in 29 years.

===Reception===

The box set received universal critical acclaim, with Metacritic scoring it 95 out of 100, based on nine reviews. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Boxed Set, the band&#x27;s first nomination since 1993 (it lost to &quot;Squeeze Box: The Complete Works of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot;).

===Deluxe edition===

===Super Deluxe edition===
The &quot;Locked N&#x27; Loaded&quot; edition and the &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; edition have the same musical contents. Disc one is the original album.


A fifth disc is included: a Blu-ray disc with 96 kHz 24-bit 5.1 surround sound and stereo mixes (mixed by Elliot Scheiner and Frank Filipetti) of all of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, alongside bonus tracks &quot;Shadow of Your Love&quot;, &quot;Patience&quot;, &quot;Used to Love Her&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Move to the City&quot; (1988 Acoustic version). In addition, this disc includes the music videos for &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot;, &quot;Sweet Child O&#x27; Mine&quot;, &quot;Paradise City&quot;, and &quot;Patience&quot;, and a previously unreleased video for &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;.

<doc id="194372" wikidata="Q902833" url="?curid=194372" title="Daydream Nation">
<text>Daydream Nation is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Sonic Youth, released on October 18, 1988. The band recorded the album between July and August 1988 at Greene St. Recording in New York City, and it was released by Enigma Records as a double album.

After &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; was released, it received widespread acclaim from critics and earned Sonic Youth a major label deal. The album was ranked high in critics&#x27; year-end lists of 1988&#x27;s best records, being voted second in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll. &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; has since been widely considered to be Sonic Youth&#x27;s greatest work, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time, specifically having a profound influence on the alternative and indie rock genres. It was chosen by the Library of Congress to be preserved in the National Recording Registry in 2005.

==Writing and recording==
Sonic Youth&#x27;s standard songwriting method involved Thurston Moore bringing in melody ideas and chord changes that the band would spend several months fashioning into full-length songs. Instead of paring the songs down as the group did with previous records, the months-long writing process for &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; resulted in long jams, some lasting over half an hour. Several friends of the band, including Henry Rollins, had praised the band&#x27;s long live improvisations and told the group that its records never captured them. With Moore on a writing spree, the album ultimately had to be expanded to a double album.

Sonic Youth recorded &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; at New York&#x27;s Greene Street basement studio. The studio&#x27;s engineer, Nick Sansano, was accustomed to working with hip hop artists. Sansano did not know much about Sonic Youth, but he was aware the band had an aggressive sound, so he showed the band members his work on Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos&quot; and Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock&#x27;s &quot;It Takes Two&quot;. The group embraced the sound of the records. Sonic Youth booked three weeks of recording time at Greene Street&#x27;s Studio A, starting in mid-July 1988. The band paid $1,000 (about $2,659 in 2024) per day of studio time, which was the most they had paid to record an album up to that point.

Due to the amount of preparation the band put into composing its music, the recording process was efficient. The session became rushed near the end, when Paul Smith, the head of the band&#x27;s British label Blast First, had set a mastering date of August 18. As a result of the time pressure, Kim Gordon was not happy with some of her vocal takes. The band spent a whole night creating a final mix for the three-song &quot;Trilogy&quot; so it could be mastered the following morning. The record ultimately cost $30,000 ($79,765 in 2024), which led Moore to refer to the album as &quot;our first non-econo record&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is generally considered an avant-rock, alternative rock, indie rock, art punk, and post-punk album, with the record being notable for its unorthodox guitar tuning and song structure, with many songs concluding with
lengthy instrumental sections. The album is especially notable for being a significant influence for later alternative and indie rock efforts and genres, including well-known grunge band Nirvana. Lyrics include topics of burnout, the music industry, and the crack epidemic of the late 1980s.

&quot;The Sprawl&quot; was inspired by the works of science fiction writer William Gibson, who used the term to refer to a future mega-city stretching from Boston to Atlanta (specifically from the Sprawl Trilogy). The lyrics for the first verse were lifted from the novel &quot;The Stars at Noon&quot; by Denis Johnson. &quot;&#x27;Cross the Breeze&quot; features some of Gordon&#x27;s most intense singing, with such lyrics as &quot;Let&#x27;s go walking on the water/Now you think I&#x27;m Satan&#x27;s daughter/I wanna know, should I stay or go?/I took a look into your hate/It made me feel very up to date&quot;. &quot;Eric&#x27;s Trip&quot; has lyrics pertaining to Eric Emerson&#x27;s LSD-fueled monologue in the Andy Warhol movie &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;.

&quot;Hey Joni&quot; is titled as a tribute to rock standard &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and to Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell. It is sung by Ranaldo, and has surrealist lyrics such as &quot;Shots ring out from the center of an empty field/Joni&#x27;s in the tall grass/She&#x27;s a beautiful mental jukebox, a sailboat explosion/A snap of electric whipcrack&quot;. This song also alludes to the works of William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot; with the line &quot;In this broken town, can you still jack in/And know what to do?&quot; These feature similarly on Ranaldo&#x27;s two other songs on the album, the rarely played &quot;Rain King&quot;—an homage to Pere Ubu and perhaps Saul Bellow&#x27;s &quot;Henderson the Rain King&quot;—and the aforementioned &quot;Eric&#x27;s Trip&quot;.

&quot;Providence&quot; consisted of a piano solo by Moore recorded at his mother&#x27;s house using a Walkman, the sound of a Peavey Roadmaster amp overheating and a pair of telephone messages left by Mike Watt, calling for Moore from a Providence, Rhode Island payphone, dubbed over one another.

The title of &quot;The Wonder&quot; comes from crime fiction writer James Ellroy&#x27;s phrase about the ineffable mystery at the heart of Los Angeles; in Moore&#x27;s words, &quot;the wonder&quot; is what &quot;for better and worse, inspires [Ellroy] to keep going, to get out of bed every day.&quot; The closing track &quot;Eliminator Jr.&quot; was inspired by the &quot;Preppie Killer&quot;, Robert Chambers. It was thus titled because the band felt it sounded like a cross between Dinosaur Jr. and &quot;Eliminator&quot;-era ZZ Top. It was given part &quot;z&quot; in the &quot;Trilogy&quot; both as a reference to ZZ Top and because it is the closing piece on the disc.

== Title and packaging ==
&quot;Daydream Nation&quot;″s title came from a lyric in the song &quot;Hyperstation&quot;. Sonic Youth had also considered the title &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Day&quot;, from a lyric in &quot;Candle&quot;, which made reference to Neil Young&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;. The cover for &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; features the 1983 Gerhard Richter painting &quot;Kerze&quot; (&quot;Candle&quot;). The back cover art is a similar Richter painting from 1982. The vinyl version&#x27;s four sides and the compact disc inner tray contain four symbols each representing one of the members of the band, in an homage to—and parody of—the four symbols from the fourth Led Zeppelin album. The symbols are infinity (∞) for Ranaldo (referencing his 1987 album &quot;From Here to Infinity&quot;), female (♀) for Gordon, uppercase omega (Ω) for Moore (referencing Leo, his zodiac sign), and a drawing of a demonic–angelic baby holding drumsticks for Shelley.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Daydream Nation&quot; was released on October 18, 1988, in compact disc, cassette and double vinyl formats. It did not chart in the United States, but reached No. 99 on the British albums chart. Three singles with accompanying music videos were also released: &quot;Teen Age Riot&quot; (in 1988 on 12-inch vinyl and CD), &quot;Providence&quot; (in the United Kingdom in 1989), &quot;Candle&quot; (October 1989 on 12-inch vinyl), and a live version of &quot;Silver Rocket&quot; for subscribers to &quot;Forced Exposure&quot;. The song &quot;Teen Age Riot&quot; was popular on alternative radio and reached No. 20 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s newly created Modern Rock Tracks chart. Sonic Youth also promoted the album with a North American tour from October to December 1988, concentrating almost exclusively on material from the album. In 1989, they took the tour to New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the USSR and Europe, finishing the year with their first network television appearance—on the syndicated &quot;Night Music&quot;—playing &quot;Silver Rocket&quot;. In 2007 they played the album live as part of the Don&#x27;t Look Back concert series, and then toured with it through Europe and Australia into 2008.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Daydream Nation&quot; received overwhelming acclaim from contemporary critics. &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;the supreme fulfillment&quot; of Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;fullbore technique&quot;. Giving the album an &quot;A&quot; grade in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau believed that while the band were embracing a &quot;happy-go-lucky careerism and four-on-the-floor maturity&quot;, their relentlessly discordant music was &quot;a philosophical triumph&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Robert Palmer rated it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it demonstrated &quot;the broad harmonic palette, sharply honed songwriting skills and sheer exhilarating drive&quot; of the &quot;influential quartet&quot;, while presenting &quot;the definitive American guitar band of the Eighties at the height of its powers and prescience&quot;.

The British music press also embraced &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;: &quot;Q&quot; magazine said the record made an &quot;enthralling noise&quot;; the &quot;NME&quot; called it the &quot;most radical and political album of the year&quot; and awarded it a maximum score of ten; and &quot;Record Mirror&quot; gave it a five-out-of-five rating, enthusing that Sonic Youth were &quot;the best band in the universe&quot;.

At the end of 1988, &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; appeared in several lists of the year&#x27;s best albums, being ranked at No. 2 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, No. 1 by &quot;CMJ&quot;, and No. 9 by &quot;NME&quot;. It was also voted the year&#x27;s second best record in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll, which made the band realize that the album had made an impact. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator and supervisor, named it the fourth best album of 1988 in his own list.

&quot;Daydream Nation&quot; has continued to earn acclaim and accolades. According to Matthew Stearns, writer of the 33⅓ book dedicated to the album, it has been &quot;resoundingly canonized as a breakthrough landmark in the chronicles of avant-rock expression&quot;. Stearns wrote that &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; comprised the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; of early indie rock double albums with Hüsker Dü&#x27;s &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; and Minutemen&#x27;s &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot;, judging that the three works &quot;together mark a period of unprecedented creative expansion in terms of the possibilities of underground (or otherwise) American rock music&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed it &quot;a masterpiece of post-punk art rock&quot; that demonstrated the degree of which &quot;noise and self-conscious avant art can be incorporated into rock, and the results are nothing short of stunning&quot;. Jon Matsumoto of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it the band&#x27;s masterpiece and said they had developed first-rate songwriting skills to complement their penchant for dissonant instrumentation.

Greg Kot, writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, called it one of the most recognizable albums of the 1980s with its combination of &quot;hypnotic guitar jams and some of the band&#x27;s best, straight-ahead tunes&quot;. Reviewing the 2007 deluxe edition, Christgau credited &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; for making alternative rock &quot;a life force&quot; and remarked that, along with the &quot;vital&quot; bonus disc, the album remained an honest and thrilling listen because of its musical tunings and anthemic songs about post-irony and &quot;confusion-as-sex&quot;. In &quot;Spin&quot;, Will Hermes said it was perhaps &quot;the greatest art-punk statement ever&quot;, while John Mulvey from &quot;Uncut&quot; called it a still radical &quot;avant-rock masterpiece&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; No. 1 on its list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s (the album dropped to No. 7 in the 2018 list). It also placed at No.13 on &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums from 1985 to 2010, No. 30 on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot; and No. 45 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. The &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; (1995) named it the ninth best alternative album, and it was ranked 11th on &quot;Guitarist&quot;″s 2000 list of the 101 essential guitar records. In 2003, the album was placed at No. 328 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums ever, and again in 2012, with the album being ranked number 171 in the 2020 edition.

&quot;Daydream Nation&quot; was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry in 2006. &quot;PopMatters&quot; included it in their list of the &quot;12 Essential 1980s Alternative Rock Albums&quot;, saying it was &quot;an ambitious double album that saw Sonic Youth&#x27;s various influences coalescing into a striking, searing whole&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Less favorably, Chuck Eddy describes &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; as &quot;two discs of good Hawkwind, with an I Ching groove sleek enough to send your cow jumping over the moon, but most of it&#x27;s watery wallpaper regardless.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Daydream Nation&quot;,&quot; remarked David Bowie, &quot;is an extraordinary album.&quot;

==Track listing==

* On some editions of the album, including all digital releases, all parts of “Trilogy” are separated as their own tracks.

===Deluxe Edition===
A deluxe edition of &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; was released in 2007, containing live versions of every track on the album, plus studio recordings of some cover songs. A 4-LP vinyl version was released on July 17, 2007.

The four-LP vinyl release of the deluxe edition has a slightly different track listing than the CD release. The first two LPs have the same track listing as the original double-LP release. However, the home demo of &quot;Eric&#x27;s Trip&quot; is at the end of the fourth LP, rather than falling immediately after the original album.

<doc id="194376" wikidata="Q184766" url="?curid=194376" title="Code page">
<text>In computing, a code page is a character encoding and as such it is a specific association of a set of printable characters and control characters with unique numbers. Typically each number represents the binary value in a single byte. (In some contexts these terms are used more precisely; see .)

The term &quot;code page&quot; originated from IBM&#x27;s EBCDIC-based mainframe systems, but Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle Corporation are among the vendors that use this term. The majority of vendors identify their own character sets by a name. In the case when there is a plethora of character sets (like in IBM), identifying character sets through a number is a convenient way to distinguish them. Originally, the code page numbers referred to the &quot;page&quot; numbers in the IBM standard character set manual, a condition which has not held for a long time. Vendors that use a code page system allocate their own code page number to a character encoding, even if it is better known by another name; for example, UTF-8 has been assigned page numbers 1208 at IBM, 65001 at Microsoft, and 4110 at SAP.

Hewlett-Packard uses a similar concept in its HP-UX operating system and its Printer Command Language (PCL) protocol for printers (either for HP printers or not). The terminology, however, is different: What others call a &quot;character set&quot;, HP calls a &quot;symbol set&quot;, and what IBM or Microsoft call a &quot;code page&quot;, HP calls a &quot;symbol set code&quot;. HP developed a series of symbol sets, each with an associated symbol set code, to encode both its own character sets and other vendors’ character sets.

The multitude of character sets leads many vendors to recommend Unicode.

== The code page numbering system ==
IBM introduced the concept of systematically assigning a small, but globally unique, 16 bit number to each character encoding that a computer system or collection of computer systems might encounter. The IBM origin of the numbering scheme is reflected in the fact that the smallest (first) numbers are assigned to variations of IBM&#x27;s EBCDIC encoding and slightly larger numbers refer to variations of IBM&#x27;s extended ASCII encoding as used in its PC hardware.

With the release of PC DOS version 3.3 (and the near identical MS-DOS 3.3) IBM introduced the code page numbering system to regular PC users, as the code page numbers (and the phrase &quot;code page&quot;) were used in new commands to allow the character encoding used by all parts of the OS to be set in a systematic way.
After IBM and Microsoft ceased to cooperate in the 1990s, the two companies have maintained the list of assigned code page numbers independently from each other, resulting in some conflicting assignments. At least one third-party vendor (Oracle) also has its own different list of numeric assignments. IBM&#x27;s current assignments are listed in their CCSID repository, while Microsoft&#x27;s assignments are documented within the MSDN. Additionally, a list of the names and approximate IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) abbreviations for the installed code pages on any given Windows machine can be found in the Registry on that machine (this information is used by Microsoft programs such as Internet Explorer).

Most well-known code pages, excluding those for the CJK languages and Vietnamese, fit all their code-points into eight bits and do not involve anything more than mapping each code-point to a single character; furthermore, techniques such as combining characters, complex scripts, etc., are not involved.

The text mode of standard (VGA-compatible) PC graphics hardware is built around using an 8-bit code page, though it is possible to use two at once with some color depth sacrifice, and up to eight may be stored in the display adapter for easy switching. There was a selection of third-party code page fonts that could be loaded into such hardware. However, it is now commonplace for operating system vendors to provide their own character encoding and rendering systems that run in a graphics mode and bypass this hardware limitation entirely. However the system of referring to character encodings by a code page number remains applicable, as an efficient alternative to string identifiers such as those specified by the IETF and IANA for use in various protocols such as e-mail and web pages.

=== Relationship to ASCII ===
The majority of code pages in current use are supersets of ASCII, a 7-bit code representing 128 control codes and printable characters. In the distant past, 8-bit implementations of the ASCII code set the top bit to zero or used it as a parity bit in network data transmissions. When the top bit was made available for representing character data, a total of 256 characters and control codes could be represented. Most vendors (including IBM) used this extended range to encode characters used by various languages and graphical elements that allowed the imitation of primitive graphics on text-only output devices. No formal standard existed for these &quot;extended ASCII character sets&quot; and vendors referred to the variants as code pages, as IBM had always done for variants of EBCDIC encodings.

=== Relationship to Unicode ===
Unicode is an effort to include all characters from all currently and historically used human languages into single character enumeration (effectively one large single code page), removing the need to distinguish between different code pages when handling digitally stored text. Unicode tries to retain backwards compatibility with many legacy code pages, copying some code pages 1:1 in the design process. An explicit design goal of Unicode was to allow round-trip conversion between all common legacy code pages, although this goal has not always been achieved.
Some vendors, namely IBM and Microsoft, have anachronistically assigned code page numbers to Unicode encodings. This convention allows code page numbers to be used as metadata to identify the correct decoding algorithm when encountering binary stored data.

=== DOS code pages ===
These code pages are used by IBM in its PC DOS operating system. These code pages were originally embedded directly in the text mode hardware of the graphic adapters used with the IBM PC and its clones, including the original MDA and CGA adapters whose character sets could only be changed by physically replacing a ROM chip that contained the font. The interface of those adapters (emulated by all later adapters such as VGA) was typically limited to single byte character sets with only 256 characters in each font/encoding (although VGA added partial support for slightly larger character sets).

== Microsoft code pages ==
=== Windows code pages ===
These code pages are used by Microsoft in its own Windows operating system. Microsoft defined a number of code pages known as the ANSI code pages (as the first one, 1252 was based on an apocryphal ANSI draft of what became ISO 8859-1). Code page 1252 is built on ISO 8859-1 but uses the range 0x80-0x9F for extra printable characters rather than the C1 control codes from ISO 6429 mentioned by ISO 8859-1. Some of the others are based in part on other parts of ISO 8859 but often rearranged to make them closer to 1252.

== Code pages from other vendors ==
These code pages are independent assignments by third party vendors. Since the original IBM PC code page (number 437) was not really designed for international use, several partially compatible country or region specific variants emerged.

These code pages number assignments are not official neither by IBM, neither by Microsoft and almost none of them is referred as a usable character set by IANA. The numbers assigned to these code pages are arbitrary and may clash to registered numbers in use by IBM or Microsoft. Some of them may predate codepage switching being added in DOS 3.3.

== List of code page assignments ==

List of known code page assignments (incomplete):

== Criticism ==
Many older character encodings (unlike Unicode) suffer from several problems. Some vendors insufficiently document the meaning of all code point values in their code pages, which decreases the reliability of handling textual data consistently through various computer systems. Some vendors add proprietary extensions to established code pages, to add or change certain code point values: for example, byte 0x5C in Shift JIS can represent either a back slash or a yen sign depending on the platform. Finally, in order to support several languages in a program that does not use Unicode, the code page used for each string/document needs to be stored.

Applications may also mislabel text in Windows-1252 as ISO-8859-1. The only difference between these code pages is that the code point values in the range 0x800x9F, used by ISO-8859-1 for control characters, are instead used as additional printable characters in Windows-1252 notably for quotation marks, the euro sign and the trademark symbol among others. Browsers on non-Windows platforms would tend to show empty boxes or question marks for these characters, making the text hard to read. Most browsers fixed this by ignoring the character set and interpreting as Windows-1252 to look acceptable. In HTML5, treating ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 is even codified as a W3C standard. Although browsers were typically programmed to deal with this behaviour, this was not always true of other software. Consequently, when receiving a file transfer from a Windows system, non-Windows platforms would either ignore these characters or treat them as a standard control characters and attempt to take the specified control action accordingly.

Due to Unicode&#x27;s extensive documentation, vast repertoire of characters and stability policy of characters, the problems listed above are rarely a concern for Unicode. UTF-8 (which can encode over one million codepoints) has replaced the code-page method in terms of popularity on the Internet.

== Private code pages ==
When, early in the history of personal computers, users did not find their character encoding requirements met, private or local code pages were created using terminate-and-stay-resident utilities or by re-programming BIOS EPROMs. In some cases, unofficial code page numbers were invented (e.g. CP895).

When more diverse character set support became available most of those code pages fell into disuse, with some exceptions such as the Kamenický or KEYBCS2 encoding for the Czech and Slovak alphabets. Another character set is Iran System encoding standard that was created by Iran System corporation for Persian language support. This standard was in use in Iran in DOS-based programs and after introduction of Microsoft code page 1256 this standard became obsolete. However some Windows and DOS programs using this encoding are still in use and some Windows fonts with this encoding exist.

In order to overcome such problems, the IBM Character Data Representation Architecture level 2 specifically reserves ranges of code page IDs for user-definable and private-use assignments. Whenever such code page IDs are used, the user must not assume that the same functionality and appearance can be reproduced in another system configuration or on another device or system unless the user takes care of this specifically.
The code page range 57344-61439 (-) is officially reserved for user-definable code pages (or actually CCSIDs in the context of IBM CDRA), whereas the range 65280-65533 (-) is reserved for any user-definable &quot;private use&quot; assignments.
For example, a non-registered custom variant of code page 437 () or 28591 () could become 57781 () or 61359 (), respectively, in order to avoid potential conflicts with other assignments and maintain the sometimes existing internal numerical logic in the assignments of the original code pages. An unregistered private code page not based on an existing code page, a device specific code page like a printer font, which just needs a logical handle to become addressable for the system, a frequently changing download font, or a code page number with a symbolic meaning in the local environment could have an assignment in the private range like 65280 ().

The code page IDs 0, 65534 () and 65535 () are reserved for internal use by operating systems such as DOS and must not be assigned to any specific code pages.

<doc id="194380" wikidata="Q230507" url="?curid=194380" title="Saint Margaret of Scotland">
<text>Saint Margaret of Scotland (; , ), also known as Margaret of Wessex, was Queen of Alba from 1070 to 1093 as the wife of King Malcolm III. Margaret was sometimes called &quot;The Pearl of Scotland&quot;. She was a member of the House of Wessex and was born in the Kingdom of Hungary to the expatriate English prince Edward the Exile. She and her family returned to England in 1057. Following the death of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, her brother Edgar Ætheling was elected as King of England but never crowned. After the family fled north, Margaret married Malcolm III of Scotland by the end of 1070.

Margaret was a pious Christian, and among many charitable works she established a ferry across the Firth of Forth in Scotland for pilgrims travelling to St Andrews in Fife, which gave the towns of South Queensferry and North Queensferry their names. Margaret was the mother of three kings of Scotland, or four, if Edmund of Scotland (who ruled with his uncle, Donald III) is counted, and of Matilda of Scotland, queen consort of England. According to the (&quot;Life of St Margaret, Queen (of the Scots)&quot;), attributed to Turgot of Durham, Margaret died at Edinburgh Castle in 1093, days after receiving the news of her husband and son&#x27;s deaths in battle.

In 1250, Pope Innocent IV canonised Margaret, and her remains were reinterred in a shrine in Dunfermline Abbey in Fife. Her relics were dispersed after the Scottish Reformation and subsequently lost. Mary, Queen of Scots, at one time owned her head, which was subsequently preserved by Jesuits in the Scots College, Douai, France, from where it was lost during the French Revolution.

==Early life==
Margaret was the daughter of the English prince Edward the Exile and his wife Agatha, and also the granddaughter of Edmund Ironside, King of England. After the death of Ironside in 1016, Canute sent the infant Edward and his brother to the court of the Swedish king, Olof Skötkonung, and they eventually made their way to Kievan Rus&#x27;. The provenance of Margaret&#x27;s mother, Agatha, is disputed.

As an adult, Edward travelled to Hungary. In 1046 he supported the successful bid of King Andrew I for the Hungarian crown. Margaret was born in Hungary about 1045. Her brother Edgar Ætheling and sister Cristina were also born in Hungary around this time. Margaret grew up in a very religious environment in the Hungarian court.

==Return to England==
Margaret came to England with the rest of her family when her father, Edward the Exile, was recalled in 1057 as a possible successor to her great uncle, the childless King Edward the Confessor. Whether from natural or sinister causes, her father died immediately after landing, and Margaret, still a child, continued to reside at the English court where her brother, Edgar Ætheling, was considered a possible successor to the English throne. When Edward the Confessor died in January 1066, Harold Godwinson was selected as king, possibly because Edgar was considered too young. After Harold&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Hastings later that year, Edgar was proclaimed King of England, but when the Normans advanced on London, the Witenagemot presented Edgar to William the Conqueror, who took him to Normandy before returning him to England in 1068, when Edgar, Margaret, Cristina, and their mother Agatha fled north to Northumbria, England.

==Journey to Scotland==

According to tradition, the widowed Agatha decided to leave Northumbria with her children and return to the continent. However, a storm drove their ship north to the Kingdom of Scotland, where they were shipwrecked in 1068. There they were given refuge by King Malcolm III. The locus where it is believed that they landed is known today as St Margaret&#x27;s Hope. Margaret&#x27;s arrival in Scotland, after the failed revolt of the Northumbrian earls, has been heavily romanticised, though one medieval source suggested that she and Malcolm were first engaged nine years earlier. That is, according to Orderic Vitalis, one of Malcolm&#x27;s earliest actions as king was to travel to the court of Edward the Confessor, in 1059 to arrange a marriage with &quot;Edward&#x27;s kinswoman Margaret, who had arrived in England two years before from Hungary&quot;. If a marriage agreement was made in 1059, it was not kept, and this may explain the Scots invasion of Northumbria in 1061 when Lindisfarne was plundered. Conversely, Symeon of Durham implied that Margaret&#x27;s first meeting with Malcolm III may not have been until 1070, after William the Conqueror&#x27;s Harrying of the North.

Malcolm III was a widower, with two sons, Donald and Duncan, and would have been attracted to marrying one of the few remaining members of the House of Wessex, the Anglo-Saxon royal family. The marriage of Malcolm and Margaret occurred in 1070. Subsequently, Malcolm executed several invasions of Northumbria to support the claim of his new brother-in-law Edgar and to increase his own power. These, however, had little effect save the devastation of the county.

==Progeny==

Margaret and Malcolm had eight children – six sons and two daughters:
# Edward (), killed along with his father in the Battle of Alnwick
# Edmund ()
# Ethelred, abbot of Dunkeld, Perth and Kinross, Scotland
# Edgar (), king of Scotland, reigned 1097–1107
# Alexander I (), King of Scotland, reigned 1107–24
# Edith (), renamed Matilda, queen of England
# Mary (1082–1116), countess of Boulogne
# David I (), king of Scotland, reigned 1124–53

==Piety==
Turgot of Durham, Bishop of St Andrews, became close to the Scottish court and a friend and spiritual adviser to Margaret.* Between 1100 and 1107, Turgot wrote a vita of her at the request of her daughter, Matilda, wife of King Henry I of England. Turgot credits her with having a civilising influence on her husband Malcolm by reading him narratives from the Bible. She instigated religious reform, striving to conform the worship and practices of the Scottish church to those of the continental church, which she experienced in her childhood. This she did on the inspiration and with the guidance of Lanfranc, a future archbishop of Canterbury. Due to these achievements, she was considered an exemplar of the &quot;just ruler&quot;, and moreover influenced her husband and children, especially her youngest son, the future King David I of Scotland, to be just and holy rulers.

&quot;The chroniclers all agree in depicting Queen Margaret as a strong, pure, noble character, who had very great influence over her husband, and through him over Scottish history, especially in its ecclesiastical aspects. Her religion, which was genuine and intense, was of the newest Roman style; and to her are attributed a number of reforms by which the Church [in] Scotland was considerably modified from the insular and primitive type which down to her time it had exhibited. Among those expressly mentioned are a change in the manner of observing Lent, which thenceforward began as elsewhere on Ash Wednesday and not as previously on the following Monday, and the abolition of the old practice of observing Saturday (Sabbath), not Sunday, as the day of rest from labour (for more information on this issue see Skene&#x27;s &quot;Celtic Scotland&quot;, book ii chap. 8).&quot;

She attended to charitable works, serving orphans and the poor every day before she ate and washing the feet of the poor in imitation of Christ. She rose at midnight each night to attend the liturgy. She invited the Benedictine Order to establish a monastery in Dunfermline, Fife in 1072, and established ferries at Queensferry and North Berwick to assist pilgrims journeying from south of the Firth of Forth to St Andrews in Fife. She used a cave on the banks of the Tower Burn in Dunfermline as a place of devotion and prayer. St Margaret&#x27;s Cave, now covered beneath a municipal car park, is open to the public. Among other deeds, Margaret also instigated the restoration of Iona Abbey. She is also known to have interceded for the release of fellow English exiles who had been forced into serfdom by the Norman conquest of England.

Margaret was as pious privately as she was publicly. She spent much of her time in prayer, devotional reading, and ecclesiastical embroidery. This apparently had considerable effect on Malcolm, who (with questions of bias) has been portrayed as illiterate: he so admired her piety that he had her books decorated in gold and silver. One of these, a pocket gospel book with portraits of the Evangelists, is in the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England.

Malcolm was largely ignorant of the long-term effects of Margaret&#x27;s endeavours, not being especially religious himself. He was content for her to pursue her reforms as she desired, which was a testament to the strength of and affection in their marriage.

==Death==
Margaret&#x27;s husband, Malcolm, and their eldest son, Edward, were killed in the Battle of Alnwick against Robert de Mowbray, the Norman Earl of Northumbria, on 13 November 1093. Her son, Edgar, was left with the task of informing his mother of their deaths. Not yet 50 years old, Margaret died on 16 November 1093, three days after the deaths of her husband and eldest son. The cause of death was reportedly grief. 

She was buried before the high altar in Dunfermline Abbey. In 1250, the year of her canonisation, her body and that of her husband were exhumed and placed in a new shrine in the abbey. The remains of Margaret and Malcolm were removed by the Abbot of Dunfermline, George Durie, to safeguard them from protestant reformers; initially they went to his rural estate at Craigluscar. In 1560, Mary, Queen of Scots had Margaret&#x27;s head removed to Edinburgh Castle as a relic to assist her in childbirth. In 1597, Margaret&#x27;s head ended up with the Jesuits at the Scots College, Douai, France, but it was lost during the French Revolution. By 1580 Philip II of Spain had the other remains of Margaret and Malcolm III transferred to the royal monastery, El Escorial, near Madrid, Spain, but their present location has not been discovered.

==Veneration==
===Canonisation and feast day===

Pope Innocent IV canonised Margaret in 1250 in recognition of her personal holiness, fidelity to the Roman Catholic Church, work for ecclesiastical reform, and charity. On 19 June 1250, after her canonisation, her remains were transferred to a chapel in the eastern apse of Dunfermline Abbey in Fife. In 1693 Pope Innocent XII moved her feast day to 10 June in recognition of the birthdate of the son of James VII of Scotland and II of England. In the revision of the General Roman Calendar in 1969, 16 November became free and the Church transferred her feast day to 16 November, the date of her death, on which it always had been observed in Scotland. However, some traditionalist Catholics continue to celebrate her feast day on 10 June.

She is also venerated as a saint in the Anglican Communion. Margaret is honoured in the Church of England, the Scottish Episcopal Church and in the Calendar of the Episcopal Church (United States) on 16 November.

===Institutions bearing her name===

Several churches throughout the world are dedicated in honour of St Margaret. One of the oldest is St Margaret&#x27;s Chapel in Edinburgh Castle, which her son King David I founded. The Chapel was long thought to have been the oratory of Margaret herself, but is now thought to have been established in the 12th century. The oldest edifice in Edinburgh, it was restored in the 19th century and refurbished in the 1990s.

<doc id="194383" wikidata="Q7704623" url="?curid=194383" title="Terry Kirkman">
<text>Terry Robert Kirkman (December 12, 1939 – September 23, 2023) was an American singer and songwriter best known as a vocalist for the pop group The Association and the writer of several of the band&#x27;s hit songs such as &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Everything That Touches You&quot;, and &quot;Six Man Band&quot;. As a member of The Association, he was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Early life==
Terry Robert Kirkman was born in Salina, Kansas, on December 12, 1939, and was raised in Chino, California. His parents both had a musical background. His father Gordon had performed in bands as a soprano saxophone player and singer, and his mother Lois played the organ and piano at church and in silent film theaters. He first learned how to play brass instruments as a child, during the Second World War. After graduating from Chino High School in 1957, he attended Chaffey College as a music major. He met Frank Zappa in college and they performed together at local coffeehouses from 1959 to 1961.

==The Association==

As a salesman visiting Hawaii in 1962, Kirkman met Jules Alexander, who was in the United States Navy at the time, and the two resolved to meet when Alexander would be discharged from his military duties.

Kirkman moved to Los Angeles with Alexander in 1963. Kirkman and Alexander founded the folk group the Inner Tubes, which at one time included both Cass Elliot and David Crosby. The Inner Tubes slowly grew from a small group into a 13-piece band called the Men.

The Men disbanded in February 1965 and Kirkman and five other members formed their own band. To find a new name, they perused a dictionary and chose &quot;the Association&quot; after it was suggested by Kirkman&#x27;s fiancée. The Association quickly gained fame with their songs &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; from their 1966 debut album &quot;And Then... Along Comes the Association.&quot;

In 1966, a collection of poems penned by the six members of the Association was released as the book &quot;Crank Your Spreaders&quot;, this was reprinted in August 1969.

Kirkman contributed vocals to many songs, including &quot;Never My Love&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, and &quot;Everything That Touches You&quot;. He performed with the group at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. His &quot;Requiem for the Masses&quot;, a song written about the war in Vietnam, featured requiem-style vocals.

The Association were nominated for a Grammy Award six times, three times each in the 9th (1967) and 10th Annual Grammy Awards (1968).

Kirkman left the Association at the end of 1972, and returned when the band was reformed in 1979, after previously splitting up the year before. After growing tired of touring, Kirkman left the band in 1984. Subsequently, on rare occasions he performed in guest appearances with the band. He was present when he and the Association&#x27;s other surviving members were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003 and when the band were recipients of the Rock Justice Awards on January 19, 2019, at The Village in Los Angeles.

A series of interviews that he and Jules Alexander took part in, in early 2023, were released in separate parts, starting on September 1, 2023. The fourth part of these interviews was released a day before his death.

==Personal life and death==
In the years following his departure from the Association, Kirkman retired from the music industry and worked in California as an addiction counselor.

Kirkman lived in Montclair, California, with his wife Heidi. He died from congestive heart failure on September 23, 2023, at age 83, following a long illness.

<doc id="194385" wikidata="Q297742" url="?curid=194385" title="Margaret the Virgin">
<text>Margaret, known as Margaret of Antioch in the West, and as Saint Marina the Great Martyr () in the East, is celebrated as a saint on 20 July in Western Christianity, on 30th of July (Julian calendar) by the Eastern Orthodox Church, and on Epip 23 and Hathor 23 in the Coptic Orthodox Church. She was reputed to have promised very powerful indulgences to those who wrote or read her life or invoked her intercessions; these no doubt helped the spread of her following. Margaret is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.

==Hagiography==
According to a 9th-century martyrology of Rabanus Maurus, Margaret suffered at Antioch in Pisidia (in what is now Turkey) in c. 304, during the Diocletianic Persecution. She was the daughter of a pagan priest named Aedesius. Her mother having died soon after her birth, Margaret was nursed by a Christian woman five or six leagues () from Antioch. Having embraced Christianity and consecrated her virginity to God, Margaret was disowned by her father, adopted by her nurse, and lived in the country keeping sheep with her foster mother. 

Olybrius, Governor of the Roman Diocese of the East, asked to marry her, with the demand that she renounce Christianity. Upon her refusal she was cruelly tortured, during which various miraculous incidents are reported to have occurred. One of these involved being swallowed by Satan in the shape of a dragon, from which she escaped alive when the cross she carried irritated the dragon&#x27;s innards. Eventually, she was decapitated.

== Historicity ==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, Margaret&#x27;s story is &quot;generally regarded to be fictitious&quot;. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states &quot;even the century to which she belonged is uncertain&quot;.

Doubts about her story are not new: by the Middle Ages, hagiographer Jacobus de Voragine (author of the well-known &quot;Golden Legend&quot;) considered her martyrology to be too fantastic and remarked that the part where she is eaten by the dragon was to be considered a legend.

==Veneration==
The Greek Marina came from Antioch in Pisidia (as opposed to Antioch of Syria), but this distinction was lost in the West. From the east her veneration spread towards England, France, and Germany, in the 11th century during the Crusades.

In 1222, the Council of Oxford added her to the list of feast days, and so her cult acquired great popularity. Many versions of the story were told in 13th-century England, in Anglo-Norman (including one ascribed to Nicholas Bozon), English, and Latin, and more than 250 churches are dedicated to her in England, most famously, St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, the parish church of the British Houses of Parliament in London. There is also a Saint Margaret Shrine in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

===Feast day===
She is recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church, being listed as such in the Roman Martyrology for 20 July.
She was also included from the 12th to the 20th century among the saints to be commemorated wherever the Roman Rite was celebrated, but was then removed from the general calendar along with other European saints through the apostolic letter &quot;Mysterii Paschalis&quot;.

The Eastern Orthodox Church knows Margaret as Saint Marina, and celebrates her feast day on 30 July. Margaret is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 20 July.

Every year on Epip 23 the Coptic Orthodox church celebrates her martyrdom day, and on Hathor 23 the church celebrates the dedication of a church to her name.
Saint Mary church in Cairo holds a relic believed to be Margaret&#x27;s right hand, previously moved from the Angel Michael Church (modernly known as Haret Al Gawayna) following its destruction in the 13th century AD.

In 2022, Margaret was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day she shares with Catherine of Alexandria and Barbara of Nicomedia on 24 November.

===Patronage===
Margaret of Antioch is a patroness of pregnant women, servant maids, kidney-sufferers, and against diabolical infestations.

==Iconography==
In art, she is often represented as a shepherdess, or pictured escaping from, or standing above, a dragon. While Western iconography typically depicts St. Margaret emerging from the dragon, Eastern Byzantine iconography tends to focus on her battle with the demon in her cell and depicts her grabbing him by his hair and swinging a copper hammer at his face.

<text>The Kansas City standard (KCS), or &quot;Byte&quot; standard, is a data storage protocol for standard cassette tapes or other audio recording media at . It originated in a symposium sponsored by &quot;Byte&quot; magazine in November 1975 in Kansas City, Missouri to develop a standard for the storage of digital microcomputer data on inexpensive consumer quality cassettes. The first systems based on the standard appeared in 1976.

One variation on the basic standard is CUTS, which is identical at 300 bit/s, but with an optional 1200 bit/s mode. CUTS is the default encoding used by several later machine families, including those from Acorn and the MSX. MSX added a higher 2400 bit/s mode that is otherwise similar. The 1200 bit/s mode of CUTS was used as the standard for cross-platform BASICODE distribution.

KCS originated from the earliest days of the microcomputer revolution, among other prolific protocols. Most home computers of the era have unique formats that are incompatible with anything.

==History==
Early microcomputers generally use punched tape for program storage, an expensive option. Computer consultant Jerry Ogdin conceived the use of audio tones on a cassette to replace the paper tapes. He took the idea to Les Solomon, editor of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; magazine, who was similarly frustrated by punched tapes. In September 1975, the two co-authored an article on the HITS (Hobbyists&#x27; Interchange Tape System), using two tones to represent 1s and 0s. Soon after, several manufacturers started using similar approaches, all incompatible.

Wayne Green, who had just started &quot;Byte&quot; magazine, wanted all the manufacturers to collaborate on a single cassette standard. He organized a two-day meeting on 7–8 November 1975 in Kansas City, Missouri. The participants settled on a system based on Don Lancaster&#x27;s design. After the meeting, Lee Felsenstein (of Processor Technology) and Harold Mauch (of Percom) wrote the standard, which was published in &quot;Byte&quot; magazine&#x27;s first issue.

A KCS cassette interface is similar to a modem connected to a serial port. The 1s and 0s from the serial port are converted to audio tones using audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK). A &quot;0&quot; bit is represented as four cycles of a 1200 Hz sine wave, and a &quot;1&quot; bit as eight cycles of 2400 Hz. This gives a data rate of 300 baud. Each frame starts with one &quot;0&quot; start bit, followed by eight data bits (least significant bit first) followed by two &quot;1&quot; stop bits, so each frame is 11 bits, for a data rate of bytes per second.

The February 1976 issue of &quot;Byte&quot; has a report on the symposium, and the March issue features two hardware examples by Don Lancaster and Harold Mauch. The 300 baud rate is reliable, but slow; a typical 8-kilobyte BASIC program takes five minutes to load. Most audio cassette circuits support higher speeds.

According to Solomon, the efforts were unsuccessful: &quot;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t last long; before the month ended, everyone went back to his own tape standard and the recording confusion got worse.&quot;

* Ray Borrill, Bloomington, Indiana
* Hal Chamberlin, The Computer Hobbyist, Raleigh, North Carolina
* Richard Smith, The Computer Hobbyist, Raleigh, North Carolina

* Mike Wise, Sphere Corporation, Bountiful, Utah

== Enhancements ==
The original standard records data as &quot;marks&quot; (one) and &quot;spaces&quot; (zero). A mark bit consists of eight cycles at a frequency of 2400 Hz, and a space bit consists of four cycles at a frequency of 1200 Hz. A word, usually one byte (8 bits) long, is recorded in little endian order, which is least significant bit first. 7-bit words are followed by a parity bit. As each 8-bit byte is encoded into 11-bits for transmission, the total throughput is 27 bytes per second.

The Tarbell Cassette Interface, which, according to early PC retailer Stan Veit, &quot;became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for S-100 computers&quot;, supported the Kansas City Standard in addition to the Tarbell &quot;native&quot; mode (&quot;Tarbell standard&quot;). The Tarbell format is very different than the KC standard and normally operated at 187 bytes per second, and able to read as high as 540 bytes per second.

Processor Technology developed the popular CUTS (Computer Users&#x27; Tape Standard), which works at either 300 or 1200 baud. The 1200 baud version simply reduced the number of cycles per bit, with a mark being two cycles of 2400 and a space being one cycle at 1200. It was otherwise the same as the original KC standard, with a single &quot;0&quot; for the start bit and two trailing &quot;1&quot;s as stop bits, giving an effective data rate of 873 bits per second. The company provided the S-100 bus CUTS Tape I/O interface board, which offers both CUTS and Kansas City standard support to any S-100 system.

The Quick CUTS standard proposed by Bob Cottis and Mike Blandford and published in the Amateur Computer Club newsletter operated at 2400 baud, encoding &quot;0&quot; as a half-cycle of 1200 Hz and &quot;1&quot; as a whole cycle of 2400 Hz. The receiver was self-clocking using a phase-locked loop. Published in 1978, it predates the 1982 patent for the similar coded mark inversion proposal.

Acorn Computers Ltd used a variation of 1200 baud CUTS for the BBC Micro, which removed one of the two stop bits to improve the throughput to 960 bits per second. Additionally, the machines used a format for data that broke files into 256-byte blocks which included sequence numbers; if there was an error during a read, the user could rewind the tape just enough to get past the bad block and try again, the system would ignore those block that had been successfully loaded previously.

MSX supports both the 1200 baud variation of the CUTS standard, as well as a new 2400 baud variant which encodes a &quot;0&quot; bit as one cycle of a 2400 Hz wave and a &quot;1&quot; bit as two cycles of a 4800 Hz wave. This gives an effective rate of approximately 1,745 bits per second. The machine&#x27;s BIOS can read data at up to 3600 baud from an ideal audio source.

== Alternative formats ==

In August 1976 at the Personal Computing show in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Bob Marsh of Processor Technology approached Bob Jones, the publisher of &quot;Interface Age&quot; magazine, about pressing software onto vinyl records. Processor Technology provided an Intel 8080 program to be recorded. This test record did not work and Processor Technology was unable to devote more time to the effort. Daniel Meyer and Gary Kay of Southwest Technical Products (SWTPC) arranged for Robert Uiterwyk to provide his 4K BASIC interpreter program for the Motorola 6800 microprocessor. The idea was to record the program on audio tape in the Kansas City format and then make a master record from the tape. Eva-Tone made Soundsheets on thin vinyl that would hold one song, these were inexpensive and could be bound in a magazine. Bill Turner and Bill Blomgren of MicroComputerSystems Inc. along with Bob Jones[8] of &quot;Interface Age&quot; and Bud Schamburger of Holiday Inn worked with Eva-Tone and developed a successful process. The intermediate stage of recording to tape produced dropouts, so a SWTPC AC-30 cassette interface was connected directly to the record cutting equipment. The May 1977 issue of &quot;Interface Age&quot; contains the first &quot;Floppy ROM&quot;, a 33 RPM record containing about six minutes of Kansas City standard audio. The September 1978 Floppy ROM Number 5 has two sides: Apple BASIC, &quot;the automated dress pattern&quot;, and IAPS format, &quot;A program for writing letters&quot;.

<doc id="194398" wikidata="Q287514" url="?curid=194398" title="Marc Bolan">
<text>Marc Bolan ( ; born Mark Feld; 30 September 1947 – 16 September 1977) was an English guitarist, singer-songwriter and poet. He was a pioneer of the glam rock movement in the early 1970s with his band T. Rex. Bolan strongly influenced artists of many genres, including glam rock, punk, post-punk, new wave, indie rock, Britpop and alternative rock. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020 as a member of T. Rex.

In the late 1960s, he rose to fame as the founder and leader of the psychedelic folk band Tyrannosaurus Rex, with whom he released four critically acclaimed albums and had one minor hit &quot;Debora&quot;. Bolan had started as an acoustic singer-writer before heading into electric music prior to the recording of T. Rex&#x27;s first single &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot; which went to number two in the UK singles chart. From 1970 to 1973, T. Rex encountered a popularity in the UK comparable to that of the Beatles, with a run of eleven top ten singles, four of which reached number one: &quot;Hot Love&quot;, &quot;Get It On&quot;, &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; and &quot;Metal Guru&quot;. The 1971 album &quot;Electric Warrior&quot;, with all songs written by Bolan, received critical acclaim, reached number 1 in the UK and became a landmark album in glam rock. From 1973, he started marrying rock with other influences, including funk, soul, gospel, disco and R&amp;B.

Bolan died in a car crash in 1977. A memorial stone and bust of Bolan, Marc Bolan&#x27;s Rock Shrine, was unveiled at the site where he died in Barnes, London. His musical influence as guitarist and songwriter is profound; he inspired many later acts over the following decades. Bolan&#x27;s March 1971 appearance on the BBC&#x27;s music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, wearing glitter on his face, performing the UK chart topper &quot;Hot Love&quot; is cited as the start of the glam rock movement.

Music critic Ken Barnes called Bolan &quot;the man who started it all&quot;. The 1971 album &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; has been described by AllMusic as &quot;the album that essentially kick-started the UK glam rock craze.&quot; Producer Tony Visconti, who worked with Bolan during his heyday, stated: &quot;What I saw in Marc Bolan had nothing to do with strings, or very high standards of artistry; what I saw in him was raw talent. I saw genius. I saw a potential rock star in Marc – right from the minute, the hour I met him.&quot;

== Early life ==
Bolan was born Mark Feld at Hackney Hospital and grew up at 25 Stoke Newington Common, in the borough of Hackney, east London, the second child of
Simeon (&quot;Sid&quot;) Feld (1920-1991), a cosmetics salesman and former lorry driver, and Phyllis Winifred (née Atkins; 1927-1991), who ran a stall at Berwick Street Market in Soho. His father was an Ashkenazi Jew with roots in Russia and Poland, while his mother was English, originally from Fulham. Moving to Wimbledon, southwest London, he fell in love with the rock and roll of Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Arthur Crudup and Chuck Berry and hung around coffee bars such as the 2i&#x27;s in Soho.

Bolan was a pupil at Northwold Primary School, Upper Clapton. At the age of nine, he was given his first guitar and began a skiffle band. While at school, he played guitar in &quot;Susie and the Hula Hoops&quot;, a trio whose vocalist was a 12-year-old Helen Shapiro. During lunch breaks at school, he would play his guitar in the playground to a small audience of friends. At 15, he was expelled from school; according to one of his friends: &quot;He&#x27;d done something wrong and he went to see the headmaster, or the deputy headmaster, Mr Pearson. He said he was going to give him the cane and Mark said no. He told him to hold out his hand and Mark nutted him.&quot;

He appeared as an extra in an episode of the television show &quot;Orlando&quot;, dressed as a mod. Bolan briefly joined a modelling agency and became a &quot;John Temple Boy&quot;, appearing in a clothing catalogue for the menswear store. He was a model for the suits in their catalogues as well as for cardboard cut-outs to be displayed in shop windows. In 1962, &quot;Town&quot; magazine featured him under the name Mark Feld as an early example of the mod movement in a photo spread orchestrated by &quot;Evening Standard&quot; columnist Angus McGill.

==Music career==
===1964–1967: Early career===
In 1964, Bolan met his first manager, Geoffrey Delaroy-Hall, and recorded a slick commercial track backed by session musicians called &quot;All at Once&quot; (a song very much in the style of his youthful hero, Cliff Richard, the &quot;English Elvis&quot;), which was later released posthumously by Danielz and Caron Willans in 2008 as a very limited edition seven-inch vinyl after the original tape recording was passed onto them by Delaroy-Hall. This track is one of Bolan&#x27;s first professional recordings.

Bolan then changed his stage name to Toby Tyler when he met and moved in with child actor Allan Warren, who became his second manager. This encounter afforded Bolan a lifeline to the heart of show business, as Warren saw Bolan&#x27;s potential while he spent hours sitting cross-legged on Warren&#x27;s floor playing his acoustic guitar. Bolan at this time liked to appear wearing a corduroy peaked cap similar to his then
-current source of inspiration, Bob Dylan. A series of photographs was commissioned with photographer Michael McGrath, although he recalls that Bolan &quot;left no impression&quot; on him at the time. Warren also hired a recording studio and had Bolan&#x27;s first acetates cut. Two tracks were later released, the Bob Dylan song &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and Dion&#x27;s &quot;The Road I&#x27;m On (Gloria)&quot;. A version of Betty Everett&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot; (still unreleased) was later submitted to EMI for a test screening but was turned down.

Warren later sold Bolan&#x27;s contract and recordings for £200 to his landlord, property mogul David Kirch, in lieu of three months&#x27; back rent, but Kirch was too busy with his property empire to do anything for him. A year or so later, Bolan&#x27;s mother pushed into Kirch&#x27;s office and shouted at him that he had done nothing for her son. She demanded he tear up the contract and he willingly complied. The tapes of the first two tracks produced during the Toby Tyler recording session vanished for over 25 years before resurfacing in 1991 and selling for nearly $8,000. Their eventual release on CD in 1993 made available some of the earliest of Bolan&#x27;s known recordings.

He signed to Decca Records in August 1965. At this point his name changed to Marc Bolan via Marc Bowland. There are several accounts of why Bolan was chosen, including that it was derived from James Bolam, that it was a contraction of Bob Dylan, and – according to Bolan himself – that Decca Records chose the name. He recorded his debut single &quot;The Wizard&quot; with the Ladybirds on backing vocals (later finding fame with Benny Hill), and studio session musicians playing all the instruments. &quot;The Wizard&quot;, Bolan&#x27;s first single, was released on 19 November 1965. It featured Jimmy Page and Big Jim Sullivan, was produced by Jim Economides, with music director Mike Leander. Two solo acoustic demos recorded shortly afterwards by the same team (&quot;Reality&quot; and &quot;Song for a Soldier&quot;) have still only been given a limited official release in 2015 on seven-inch vinyl. Both songs are in a folk style reminiscent of Dylan and Donovan. A third song, &quot;That&#x27;s the Bag I&#x27;m In&quot;, written by New York folk singer and Dylan contemporary Fred Neil, was also committed to tape, but has not yet been released. In June 1966, a second official single was also released, with session-musician accompaniment, &quot;The Third Degree&quot;, backed by &quot;San Francisco Poet&quot;, Bolan&#x27;s paean to the beat poets. Neither song made the charts.

In 1966, Bolan turned up at Simon Napier-Bell&#x27;s front door with his guitar and proclaimed that he was going to be a big star and he needed someone to make all of the arrangements. Napier-Bell invited Bolan in and listened to his songs. A recording session was immediately booked and the songs were very simply recorded (most of them were not actually released until 1974, on the album &quot;The Beginning of Doves&quot;). Only &quot;Hippy Gumbo&quot;, a sinister-sounding, baroque folk-song, was released at the time as Bolan&#x27;s third unsuccessful single. One song, &quot;You Scare Me to Death&quot;, was used in a toothpaste advertisement. Some of the songs also resurfaced in 1982, with additional instrumentation added, on the album &quot;You Scare Me to Death&quot;. Napier-Bell managed the Yardbirds and John&#x27;s Children and was at first going to slot Bolan into the Yardbirds. In early 1967, he eventually settled instead for John&#x27;s Children because they needed a songwriter and he admired Bolan&#x27;s writing ability. The band achieved some success as a live act but sold few records. A John&#x27;s Children single written by Bolan called &quot;Desdemona&quot; was banned by the BBC for its line &quot;lift up your skirt and fly&quot;.

His tenure with the band was brief. Following an ill-fated German tour with the Who, Bolan took some time to reassess his situation. Bolan&#x27;s imagination was filled with new ideas and he began to write fantasy novels (&quot;The Krakenmist&quot; and &quot;Pictures Of Purple People&quot;) as well as poems and songs, sometimes finding it hard to separate facts from his own elaborate myth – he famously claimed to have spent time with a wizard in Paris who gave him secret knowledge and could levitate. The time spent with him was often alluded to but remained &quot;mythical&quot;. In reality the wizard was probably American actor Riggs O&#x27;Hara with whom Bolan made a trip to Paris in 1965. Given time to reinvent himself, after John&#x27;s Children, Bolan&#x27;s songwriting took off and he began writing many of the poetic and neo-romantic songs that appeared on his first albums with T. Rex.

===1967–1970: Tyrannosaurus Rex===
Bolan left John&#x27;s Children when, among other problems, the band&#x27;s equipment had been repossessed by their label Track Records. Unperturbed, he rallied to create Tyrannosaurus Rex, his own rock band together with guitarist Ben Cartland, drummer Steve Peregrin Took and an unknown bass player. Napier-Bell recalled of Bolan: &quot;He got a gig at the Electric Garden then put an ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; to get the musicians. The paper came out on Wednesday, the day of the gig. At three o&#x27;clock he was interviewing musicians, at five he was getting ready to go on stage... It was a disaster. He just got booed off the stage.&quot; Following this concert, Bolan pared the band down to just himself and Took, and they continued as a psychedelic-folk rock acoustic duo, playing Bolan&#x27;s songs, with Took playing assorted hand and kit percussion and occasional bass to Bolan&#x27;s acoustic guitars and voice. Napier-Bell said of Bolan that after the first disastrous electric gig, &quot;He didn&#x27;t have the courage to try it again; it really had been a blow to his ego... Later he told everyone he&#x27;d been forced into going acoustic because Track Records had repossessed all his gear. In fact he&#x27;d been forced to go acoustic because he was scared to do anything else.&quot;

The original version of Tyrannosaurus Rex with Took released three albums; two reached the top fifteen in the UK Albums Chart. They also had a top 40 hit &quot;Debora&quot; in 1968. They were supported with airplay by BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. One of the highlights of this era was when the duo played at the first free Hyde Park concert in 1968. Although the free-spirited, drug-taking Took was fired from the group after their first American tour, they were a force within the hippie underground scene while they lasted. Their music was filled with Bolan&#x27;s otherworldly poetry. In 1969, Bolan published his first and only book of poetry entitled &quot;The Warlock of Love&quot;. Although some critics dismissed it as self-indulgence, it was full of Bolan&#x27;s florid prose and wordplay, selling 40,000 copies and in 1969–70 became one of Britain&#x27;s best-selling books of poetry. It was reprinted in 1992 by the Tyrannosaurus Rex Appreciation Society.

In keeping with his early rock and roll interests, Bolan began bringing amplified guitar lines into the duo&#x27;s music, buying a white Fender Stratocaster decorated with a paisley teardrop motif from Syd Barrett. After replacing Took with Mickey Finn, he let the electric influences come forward even further on &quot;A Beard of Stars&quot;, the final album to be credited to Tyrannosaurus Rex. It closed with the song &quot;Elemental Child&quot;, featuring a long electric guitar break influenced by Jimi Hendrix.

===1971–1975: T. Rex, glam rock and other styles===

Becoming more adventurous musically, Bolan bought a modified vintage Gibson Les Paul guitar (featured on the cover of the album &quot;T. Rex&quot;), and then wrote and recorded his first hit &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot;, which was dominated by a rolling hand-clapping back-beat, Bolan&#x27;s electric guitar and Finn&#x27;s percussion. At this time he also shortened the group&#x27;s name to T. Rex. Bolan and his producer Tony Visconti oversaw the session for &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot;, the single that changed Bolan&#x27;s career which was inspired in part by Mungo Jerry&#x27;s success with &quot;In the Summertime&quot;, moving Bolan away from predominantly acoustic numbers to a more electric sound. Recorded on 1 July 1970 and released later that year, it made slow progress in the UK Top 40, until it finally peaked in early 1971 at number two. Inspired by his muse, June Child, Bolan developed a fascination with women&#x27;s clothing, an unlikely characteristic for a British male rocker at the time.

Bolan followed &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot; and &quot;T. Rex&quot; by expanding the group to a quartet with bassist Steve Currie and drummer Bill Legend, and cutting a five-minute single, &quot;Hot Love&quot;, with a rollicking rhythm, string accents and an extended sing-along chorus inspired somewhat by &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. Bolan performed &quot;Hot Love&quot; on the BBC television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; wearing glitter on his face: the performance was later recognized as the foundation of glam rock. For the viewers, it was a defining moment: &quot;Bolan was magical, but also sexually heightened and androgynous&quot;. The song was number one in the UK Singles Chart for six weeks and was quickly followed by &quot;Get It On&quot;, a grittier, more adult tune that spent four weeks in the top spot. The song, re-titled &quot;Bang a Gong (Get It On)&quot; when released in the US, reached No. 10 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 1972.

In November 1971, the band&#x27;s record label, Fly, released the &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; track &quot;Jeepster&quot; without Bolan&#x27;s permission. Outraged, Bolan took advantage of the timely lapsing of his Fly Records contract and left for EMI, who gave him his own record label, the T. Rex Wax Co. Its bag and label featured a head-and-shoulders image of Bolan. Despite the lack of Bolan&#x27;s endorsement, &quot;Jeepster&quot; peaked at number two in the UK Singles Chart. Regarded as one of the band&#x27;s best songs, &quot;Paste&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it number one and three on their lists of the top 10 T. Rex songs.

In 1972, he achieved two more UK number ones with &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; and &quot;Metal Guru&quot; taken from &quot;The Slider&quot;, and two number twos in &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; and &quot;Solid Gold Easy Action&quot;. In the same year he appeared in &quot;Born to Boogie&quot;, a documentary by Ringo Starr about T. Rex including a concert filmed at London&#x27;s Wembley Empire Pool in March 1972. Mixed in were surreal scenes shot at John Lennon&#x27;s mansion in Ascot and a session with T. Rex joined by Ringo Starr on a second drum kit and Elton John on piano. At this time T. Rex record sales accounted for about six per cent of total British domestic record sales. The band was reportedly selling 100,000 records a day; however, no T. Rex single ever became a million-seller in the UK, despite many gold discs and an average of four weeks at the top per number one hit. No T. Rex record was certified until 1985, as the record company had to pay for it, which Bolan&#x27;s did not in the 1970s.

Bolan took to wearing top hats and feather boas on stage as well as putting drops of glitter on each of his cheekbones. Stories are conflicting about his inspiration for this – some say it was introduced by his personal assistant, Chelita Secunda, although Bolan told John Pidgeon in a 1974 interview on Radio 1 that he noticed the glitter on his wife, June Child&#x27;s dressing table prior to a photo session and casually daubed some on his face there and then. Other performers – and their fans – soon took up variations on the idea.

The glam era also saw the rise of Bolan&#x27;s friend David Bowie, whom Bolan had come to know in the underground days (Bolan had played guitar on Bowie&#x27;s 1970 single &quot;Prettiest Star&quot;; Bolan and Bowie also shared the same manager, Les Conn, and producer, Tony Visconti) but their friendship was also a rivalry, which continued throughout his career. Bowie&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; name-checked T. Rex. Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Lady Stardust&quot; is generally interpreted as alluding to fellow glam rock icon Bolan. The original demo version was entitled &quot;He Was Alright (A Song for Marc)&quot;

In 1973, Bolan played twin lead guitar alongside his friend Jeff Lynne on the Electric Light Orchestra songs &quot;Ma-Ma-Ma Belle&quot; and &quot;Dreaming of 4000&quot; (originally uncredited) from &quot;On the Third Day&quot;, as well as on &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Born to Die&quot;, which was not released at the time but appears as a bonus track on the 2006 remaster.

For the following recording sessions, he recruited soul female singers for the backing vocals on &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;, which peaked at number 3 in March, and mid-year &quot;The Groover&quot; which went to number four. &quot;Tanx&quot;, parts of which found him heading towards soul, funk and gospel, was both a commercial and critical success in several European countries. &quot;Truck On (Tyke)&quot; missed the UK top 10 reaching only No. 12 in December. However, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; from the 1974 album &quot;Zinc Alloy and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow&quot; showed that Bolan was attempting to create richer, more involved music than he had previously attempted with T. Rex. He expanded the line up of the band to include a second guitarist, Jack Green, and other studio musicians, and began to take more control over the sound and production of his records, including by then girlfriend Gloria Jones on keyboards as well as backing vocals.

Eventually, the vintage T. Rex line-up disintegrated. Bolan&#x27;s marriage came to an end because of his affair with backing singer Jones, which began in July 1973. He spent a good deal of his time in the US during this period, continuing to release singles and albums, putting R &amp; B influences with rock on &quot;Bolan&#x27;s Zip Gun&quot;.

===1976–1977: resurgence and final year===
In September 1975, Gloria Jones gave birth to Bolan&#x27;s son, whom they named Rolan Bolan (although his birth certificate lists him as &#x27;Rolan Seymour Feld&#x27;). That same year, Bolan returned to the UK from tax exile in the US and Monaco and to the public eye with a low-key tour. Bolan made regular appearances on the LWT pop show &quot;Supersonic&quot;, directed by his old friend Mike Mansfield and released a succession of singles, including &quot;New York City&quot; which reached the top 15. By then, Bolan was current with the music scene, incorporating disco elements in &quot;Futuristic Dragon&quot; and the single &quot;Dreamy Lady&quot;. The last remaining member of Bolan&#x27;s halcyon era T. Rex, Currie, left the group in late 1976. In early 1977, Bolan got a new band together, released a new album, &quot;Dandy in the Underworld&quot;, and set out on a fresh UK tour, taking along punk band the Damned as support to entice a young audience who did not remember his heyday barely five years previously.

Later in 1977, Granada Television commissioned Bolan to front a six-part series called &quot;Marc&quot; in which he hosted a mix of new and established bands and performed his own songs. By this time Bolan had lost weight, appearing as trim as he had during T. Rex&#x27;s earlier heyday. The show was broadcast during the post-school half-hour on ITV earmarked for children and teenagers and it was a big success. One episode reunited Bolan with his former John&#x27;s Children bandmate Andy Ellison, then fronting the band Radio Stars.

Bolan&#x27;s longtime friend and sometimes rival David Bowie was the final guest on the last episode of &quot;Marc&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s solo song &quot;Heroes&quot; was the show&#x27;s penultimate song; Bolan signed off, naming some of the musicians: &quot;All the cats; you know who they are&quot;; they then began to play a bluesy song, over the closing credits. After four words of Bowie&#x27;s vocals, however, Bolan stumbled forward, and off the stage, but managed to grab the microphone, and find a smile. Bowie&#x27;s amusement was clearly visible, and the band stopped playing after a few seconds. With no time for a retake, the occurrence was aired.

==Personal life==
Bolan began his first serious romantic relationship, with Teresa Whipman, in 1965. They broke up in 1968 when Bolan met June Ellen Child. The pair immediately fell in love and moved into a flat together after knowing each other for only a few days.
They married on 30 January 1970. She was a former secretary to his then managers, Blackhill Enterprises, also the managers of another of his heroes, Syd Barrett, who June had previously dated. She was also influential in raising her new husband&#x27;s profile in the music industry. Bolan&#x27;s relationship with June was tumultuous; he engaged in several affairs over the course of their marriage, including one with singer Marsha Hunt in 1969, and another with artist Barbara Nessim while recording in America in 1971. The couple separated in 1973, after June found out about Bolan&#x27;s affair with his backing singer Gloria Jones. After Bolan&#x27;s death, June revealed that she had abortions during their marriage because she believed Bolan was not mature enough to be a father.
Bolan and Gloria Jones were in a committed romantic relationship from 1973 until his death in September 1977.
The couple had a son together in September 1975 and the three of them lived together for nearly two years until Bolan&#x27;s death. At the end of June 1976, June Bolan sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery, citing Gloria Jones as the third party. At the court hearing on 5 October 1976, Deputy Judge Donald Ellison declared: &quot;I am satisfied that the husband committed adultery with the co-respondent, and that the wife finds it intolerable to live with him&quot;, and granted a decree nisi. Twelve months after that date, it was to become a decree absolute, thus severing the Bolans&#x27; matrimonial ties. &quot;The facts are that she initially left me, and we just grew apart,&quot; Bolan explained after the ruling. &quot;There were no great scenes, no smashing things up. It just suddenly happened one day. We weren&#x27;t a couple anymore.&quot; He also used the opportunity to shed a little light on his sexuality. &quot;Anyway, I&#x27;m gay,&quot; he only half-jested. &quot;I can&#x27;t say I was a latent homosexual – I was an early one. But sex was never a great problem. I&#x27;m a great screwer&quot;. Asked about the institution of marriage, he replied: &quot;Gloria doesn&#x27;t want to get married and neither do I. If I ever marry anyone again, I&#x27;ll put in a clause that when it ends you&#x27;re on your own – and that means financially, too.&quot; During an interview in 1975, Bolan was also asked about his sexuality, and said that he was bisexual.

== Death ==
Bolan never learned to drive, fearing he would die before reaching 30 years old. Despite this fear, cars or automotive components are at least mentioned in, if not the subject of, many of his songs. He also owned a number of vehicles, including a white 1960s Rolls-Royce that was loaned by his management to the band Hawkwind on the night of his death.

On 16 September 1977, Bolan was a passenger in a Mini 1275GT driven by Gloria Jones as they headed home from Morton&#x27;s Club Restaurant in Berkeley Square, London. Both had been drinking alcohol, and after crossing a small humpback bridge near Gipsy Lane on Queens Ride, Barnes, South West London, the car struck a fence post and then a tree. Bolan died at the scene. Jones was critically injured.

The car crash site has become a shrine to his memory, where fans leave tributes beside the tree. In 2013, the shrine was featured on the BBC Four series &quot;Pagans and Pilgrims: Britain&#x27;s Holiest Places&quot;. The site, Marc Bolan&#x27;s Rock Shrine, is owned and maintained by the T. Rex Action Group.

His funeral service was held on 20 September 1977 at the Golders Green Crematorium in North London. Bolan&#x27;s ashes were later buried under a rose bush. Bolan&#x27;s funeral was attended by David Bowie, Rod Stewart, Tony Visconti, Steve Harley and Boy George among other musicians. 
Bolan had arranged a discretionary trust to safeguard his money. A small, separate Jersey-based trust fund has allowed his son to receive some income. However, the bulk of Bolan&#x27;s fortune, variously estimated at between £20 and £30 million (approx $38 – $57 million), remains in trust.
== Legacy ==
Bolan strongly influenced artists of many genres, including glam rock, punk, post-punk, new wave, indie rock, Britpop and alternative rock. After seeing Bolan wearing Zandra Rhodes-designed outfits, Freddie Mercury enlisted Rhodes to design costumes for the next Queen tour in 1974. Bolan was the early guitar idol of Johnny Marr, who later found fame as the guitarist of the influential indie rock band the Smiths. In 1979, Siouxsie and the Banshees released a cover of &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; as the B-side to the single &quot;The Staircase (Mystery)&quot;. The band had played the song live for several months and on the first anniversary of Bolan&#x27;s death in 1978 played the song as the encore when they performed at Aylesbury Friars. Emerging in the New Romantic movement in the early 1980s, Boy George spoke of the impact Bolan and Bowie had on him: &quot;They represented a kind of bohemian existence that I – at that point – could only imagine living. I loved the music. The first time I ever saw Marc Bolan really, properly was singing &#x27;Metal Guru&#x27; and just loved him. I don&#x27;t think you can separate an artist from what they wear or what they sing – it&#x27;s kind of the complete package.&quot; 
The 1973 album &quot;Still&quot; by former King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield mentions Bolan in the title track: &quot;Beatles and Bolans, raindrops and oceans&quot;. In December 1980, &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; was the fourth single released by British gothic rock band Bauhaus. Also in 1980, the Bongos were the first American group, with &quot;Mambo Sun&quot;, to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with a T. Rex cover. Since then, Bongos frontman Richard Barone has recorded several other Bolan compositions (&quot;The Visit,&quot; &quot;Ballrooms of Mars&quot;), worked with T. Rex producer Tony Visconti for his 2010 solo album, &quot;Glow&quot;, that includes a remake of Bolan&#x27;s &quot;Girl&quot; from &quot;Electric Warrior&quot;, and has himself produced tracks for Bolan&#x27;s son Rolan. In 1983, NWOBHM band Girlschool covered &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; on their album &quot;Play Dirty&quot;. In 1984, the Replacements released a cover of &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; as a B-side to the single &quot;I Will Dare&quot;; it is also included on the reissue version of their album &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

In 1985, Duran Duran splinter band the Power Station, with Robert Palmer as vocalist, took a version of &quot;Get It On&quot; into the UK Top 40 and to US No. 6, the first cover of a Bolan song to enter the charts since his death. They also performed the tune (with Michael Des Barres replacing Palmer) at the Live Aid concert. In 1986, Violent Femmes covered the song &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; on their album, &quot;The Blind Leading the Naked&quot;. In 1989, X released a live cover of &quot;20th Century Boy&quot; as the B-side to their single &quot;Kurenai&quot;. In 1990, Baby Ford did a cover of &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; that appeared on the album &quot;Oooh, The World of Baby For&quot;. In 1991, Japanese rock band T-Bolan were named after T. Rex and Bolan.
&quot;20th Century Boy&quot; introduced a new generation of devotees to Bolan&#x27;s work in 1991 when it was featured on a Levi&#x27;s jeans TV commercial featuring Brad Pitt, and was re-released, reaching No. 13 in the UK. The song was performed by the fictional band the Flaming Creatures (performed by Placebo, reprised by Placebo and David Bowie at the 1999 Brit Awards) in the 1998 film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;. In every decade since his death, a Bolan greatest hits compilation has placed in the top 20 UK albums and periodic boosts in sales have come via cover versions from artists inspired by Bolan, including Morrissey. In 1991, Morrissey and David Bowie performed a duet of &quot;Cosmic Dancer&quot; at the Inglewood Forum in Los Angeles.

In 1993, Guns N&#x27; Roses covered &quot;Buick MacKane&quot; on &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, and their guitarist Slash has worn a t-shirt with an image of Bolan on the front. The main riff of Oasis&#x27; 1994 hit &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol&quot; is lifted from &quot;Get It On&quot;. In 1993, Adam Ant covered the track live on his &quot;Persuasion&quot; tour. The song was included on a private preview show on 21 February 1993 in Burbank, Los Angeles which was recorded and released, complete with the cover version, as a live bonus CD with 1994 pressings of his &quot;&quot; collection.

The Cameron Crowe-created movie &quot;Almost Famous&quot; features a scene where a Black Sabbath groupie is telling aspiring journalist William Miller (said to be created in Crowe&#x27;s own image) about how, &quot;Marc Bolan broke her heart, man. It&#x27;s famous,&quot; regarding the character of Penny Lane, played by Kate Hudson. In 2000, Naoki Urasawa created a Japanese manga entitled &quot;20th Century Boys&quot; that was inspired by Marc Bolan&#x27;s song, &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;. The series is a multiple award-winner, and has also been released in North America. The story was adopted into three successful live-action movies from 2008 to 2009, which were also released in the US, Canada and the UK.

In 2003, Depeche Mode&#x27;s Martin Gore recorded covers of &quot;Life Is Strange&quot; and &quot;Left Hand Luke and the Beggar Boys&quot;, and included them as b-sides of the single &quot;Stardust&quot;. In 2006, Def Leppard released their album &quot;Yeah!&quot;, which contains covers of their favourite bands while growing up, the first song on this album is &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;. Joe Elliott wanted to sing &quot;Metal Guru&quot; while Vivian Campbell wanted &quot;Telegram Sam&quot; but end up agreeing to &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;. &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; was performed by Elton John and Pete Doherty of the Libertines at Live 8, in 2005. U2&#x27;s Bono and Gavin Friday also covered &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; on the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; soundtrack. In 2020, Kesha would also record a cover of the song along with Marc Bolan&#x27;s son, Rolan, on backing vocals.

His music is still widely used in films, recent notable cases being &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot;, &quot;Death Proof&quot;, &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot;, &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, &quot;Jarhead&quot;, &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, The Truman Show, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Breaking-Up&quot;, &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, &quot;Click&quot;, &quot;School of Rock&quot;, &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, &quot;Baby Driver&quot; and &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;. Bolan is still cited by many guitar-centric bands as a huge influence (Joy Division/New Order&#x27;s Bernard Sumner has said that the first single he owned was &quot;Ride a White Swan&quot;.) However, he always maintained he was a poet who put lyrics to music. The tunes were never as important as the words.

In 2007, the English Tourist Board included Bolan&#x27;s Rock Shrine in their guide to Important Sites of Rock &#x27;n Roll interest &#x27;England Rocks&#x27;. As reported in 2011, a school is planned in his honour, to be built in Sierra Leone: The Marc Bolan School of Music and Film. A musical, &quot;20th Century Boy&quot;, based on Bolan&#x27;s life, and featuring his music, premiered at the New Wolsey Theatre in Ipswich in 2011.

In September 2020, a tribute album produced by Hal Willner, &quot;Angelheaded Hipster&quot;, was released featuring covers of Bolan songs by a variety of artists including Nick Cave, U2, Elton John, Joan Jett, Nena and Todd Rundgren. Two months later, Bolan and T. Rex bandmates Steve Currie, Mickey Finn and Bill Legend were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2020 by The Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.

<doc id="194399" wikidata="Q317412" url="?curid=194399" title="Lars Korvald">
<text>(29 April 1916 – 4 July 2006) was a Norwegian politician and educator who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1972 to 1973. He became associated with the Christian Democratic Party and was elected to the Norwegian Parliament. As prime minister he led the cabinet that took over when Trygve Bratteli resigned in the wake of the first referendum over Norway&#x27;s membership in the European Economic Community.

==Early life and career==
Lars Korvald was born at Nedre Eiker in Buskerud, Norway. His parents were Engebret Korvald (1873-1956) and Karen Sofie Wigen (1876-1965).
He attended Hamar Cathedral School graduating in 1940. He attended the Norwegian College of Agriculture at Ås in Akershus where he graduated in 1943.

Lars Korvald had been educated in agricultural studies. Upon graduation, he joined the faculty of the Tomb Agricultural School (&quot;Tomb Jordbruksskol&quot;). The school was situated by the Krokstadfjordenon at Råde in Østfold. This was the site of a former estate (&quot;Tomb herregård i Råde&quot;) which had dated from the Middle Ages. In 1938, the estate was purchased by the Norwegian Lutheran Mission (&quot;Det norske lutherske Indremisjonsselskap&quot;) which established a high school and a modern farm operation on the property. The school offered several education programs with the principal focus on agriculture and agronomy. Korvald became Rector at Tomb in 1952.

==Parliamentary career==
Korvald was first elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1961 representing the county of Østfold. In 1965, he was appointed parliamentary leader; and in 1967 the party leader. Altogether, Korvald served as a member of Parliament for five terms between 1961 and 1981. He was President of the Lagting 1969–1972.

==Prime minister==

Lars Korvald served as prime minister from 18 October 1972 to 16 October 1973. Though short-lived, his cabinet served as an important milestone in Norwegian politics, both because it marked the conclusion of the bitter and divisive debate over Norway&#x27;s membership in the European Economic Community (EEC) and because it was a centrist non-socialist coalition. He was also the first prime minister from the Christian Democratic Party.

Korvald proved to be an effective prime minister in a very difficult and transitional political situation. His cabinet commissioned the negotiations for a trade treaty with the EEC and instituted Norway&#x27;s first petroleum policy. In addition, the Teachers&#x27; Training Law of June 1973 was a move to raise teacher training to university status.

Korvald didn’t seek re-election in 1981 to the Storting after 20 years of service. That same autumn he was appointed County Governor in Østfold. He held in this position until he retired at the age of 70 in 1986.

==Personal life==
In 1943, he married Ruth Aarny Borgersen (1915–2006). While serving as prime minister, Korvald resided in Bærum. He later resided in Moss, but in his later life he moved back to Mjøndalen.

He started his political career serving as mayor of his home municipally, Flå, from 1945 to 1955. He was elected to the Norwegian parliament in 1949 and stayed there until his retirement in 1977. Borten was President of the Odelsting 1961–1965 and 1973–1977.

==Political career==
He was appointed president of the Odelsting, acted as the parliamentary leader for his party and served as its chairman from 1955 to 1967. As Prime Minister of Norway from 1965, he headed a four-party centre-right coalition government, until 17 March 1971, when the government dissolved itself. He resigned as Prime Minister when it became known that he had shown confidential information about Norway in the negotiations concerning European Economic Community membership, with amongst others, Arne Haugestad, then leader of the People&#x27;s Movement against Norwegian membership of the EEC.

Borten&#x27;s time as Prime Minister of Norway saw the enactment of a range of progressive reforms. Earnings-related pensions were introduced in 1966, while under a June 1969 law the Housing Bank offered loans for improving old dwellings. The Special Supplement to National Insurance Benefits Law of June 1969 established a special supplement for those not entitled to supplementary pensions, and the Law on Compensation Supplement to National Insurance Benefits of December 1969 introduced a supplement to compensate for the introduction of a value-added tax system. The Basic Schooling Law of June 1969 introduced 9-year comprehensive schooling, while under another law passed that same year, family allowances were extended to the first child under the age of 16, while single-parent families were provided with one extra allowance in addition to the number of children.

==Later life==
After his retirement from politics, Borten continued to speak out on issues such as nuclear disarmament, clandestine surveillance, and the controversy on Norway&#x27;s relationship to the European Union. He served on the boards of several public banking organizations. He earned a reputation for being an engaging and somewhat contrarian figure in the Norwegian political landscape.

His down-to-earth nature had been strongly underlined in 1969, when newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot; interviewed him at his farm while he was prime minister. He did the interview wearing nothing but a pair of shoes, a hat and trunks, only days before Queen Elizabeth II was invited to the same farm on a state visit to Norway. The picture of Borten in his underwear went around the world, and the British newspaper &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; printed the picture over two pages with the headline: &quot;Now the Norwegian Prime Minister is ready to receive the Queen&quot;.

Another popular story was when Borten&#x27;s Defence Minister, Otto Grieg Tidemand, invited him and others to a private dinner. After eating, Tidemand surprised his guests with the finest vintage brandy. Without blinking Borten responded by pouring the brandy into his coffee, making himself &quot;karsk&quot;.

Borten died at St. Olav&#x27;s Hospital in Trondheim at the age of 91. He was buried at Flå Church in Melhus Municipality. His wife Magnhild died on 2 June 2006, aged 84.

<doc id="194402" wikidata="Q337301" url="?curid=194402" title="John Lyng">
<text>(22 August 1905 – 18 January 1978) was a Norwegian politician from the Conservative Party. He was the prime minister of Norway from 28 August to 25 September 1963 in a coalition government consisting of the Conservative, Centre, Christian Democratic, and Liberal parties. It was the first government in 28 years that was not headed by the Labour Party.

== Early life ==
Lyng was born in Trondheim to merchant Markus Hartman Lyng (1872–1938) and Martha Maria Helberg (1885–1959), and graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1927. He studied in Oslo, Copenhagen, and Heidelberg in 1931. During his student years, Lyng was active in the leftist &quot;Mot Dag&quot; student grouping, and his time in Weimar Germany in the early 1930s gave him a strong dislike of totalitarian movements as Nazism was on the rise there. Before and after World War II he worked as a lawyer and a judge.

He joined the Norwegian resistance movement during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. He raised the mountain cabin Skardøla in Sylene, about 50 metres from the Norway-Sweden border, which was used as an outpost by resistance fighters such as Odd Sørli, Johnny Pevik, and Nils Uhlin Hansen. Lyng later fled the country, and worked in the Norwegian legation in Stockholm&#x27;s law office from 1943 to 1944, and in the Norwegian government administration-in-exile in London until 1945.

== Political career ==
Lyng was originally a member of the Free-minded Liberal Party, heading the local party chapter from 1934 to 1935. He was a member of the executive committee of Trondheim city council from 1934 to 1940 and in 1945, but had changed to the Conservative Party in 1938, heading the party chapter in Trondheim until 1947. Lyng was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from the Market towns of Sør-Trøndelag and Nord-Trøndelag counties in 1945, and was re-elected in 1949. He was then out of parliament for one term, before being elected again in 1957 and in 1961, this time from Akershus, and was elected leader of the Conservative Party&#x27;s parliamentary group. From 1955 to 1959 he was a member of the municipal council of Skien Municipality.

His brief stint as Prime Minister came in August 1963 after the two representatives from the Socialist People&#x27;s Party (SF) joined a slim 76-74 no confidence vote against the cabinet Gerhardsen following the Kings Bay Affair, a series of mining accidents at Ny-Ålesund. Lyng quickly realised that between them, the non-socialist parties were only one seat short of a majority in the Storting, and that if they banded together, they would be able to form a government as long as the SF abstained. He quickly pulled together a coalition which took office on 28 August. The socialist vote of no confidence was merely a protest and demonstration, and the Labour cabinet was restored a month later after the SF threw its support back to Labour. While Lyng was Prime Minister Ebba Haslund took his seat in parliament.

Although the cabinet Lyng only lasted a month, it proved that the non-socialist parties were capable of forming a government. Following the 1965 elections the non-socialist parties won a majority with Per Borten as Prime Minister, and John Lyng as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was replaced by Svenn Stray in 1970.

Lyng held the post of County Governor of Oslo and Akershus from 1964 to 1965. He is also remembered for pursuing Norwegian membership in the EEC.

== Personal life ==
He married physician Gisela Gerda Margarete Lutz (1907–1941) in 1932. They were divorced in 1940. In 1944 he married lawyer Liv Godager (1918–1989).

Lyng spent his later years writing his memoirs. He died in 1978, after being diagnosed with cancer the preceding year.

<doc id="194405" wikidata="Q355258" url="?curid=194405" title="Oscar Torp">
<text>Oscar Fredrik Torp (, 8 June 1893 – 1 May 1958) was a Norwegian politician for the Norwegian Labour Party. He was party leader from 1923 to 1945, and mayor of Oslo in 1935 and 1936. In 1935 he became the acting minister of defence in the government of Johan Nygaardsvold. He was also the minister of social affairs from 1936 to 1939, and then the minister of finance from 1939 to 1942. He was appointed minister of defence again in 1942 in the London-based Norwegian exile government. He continued until the election in 1945 when he became the minister of provisioning and reconstruction until 1948.

Hailing from Skjeberg, he was first elected to the Parliament of Norway representing Oslo in 1936, but did not take a seat in the Parliament until 1948. He then became the faction leader for the Labour Party in Parliament. He became the prime minister of Norway in 1951 when Einar Gerhardsen stepped down from this position; the move was reversed in 1955 when Torp became the president of the Storting. He held this position until his death.

==Early life and career==
He was born in Skjeberg as a son of Anton Fredrik Andersen Torp (1865–1907) and Anne Bolette Andreassen Gade (1867–1932). He had eight siblings, and lost his father at a young age. His father worked in Canada from 1903, and sailed home to collect his family to emigrate to Canada in 1907. However he died en route, near Liverpool. Torp attended primary school before joining the workforce at age 13. He eventually became an electrician, and already at the age of 14 he became deputy treasurer in his local trade union. He also joined the Norwegian Labour Party, and was elected to the national board in 1918, when an opposition of revolutionaries assumed power in the party. Torp chaired the party chapter in Sarpsborg from 1919 to 1921 and in Østfold county from 1921 to 1923. He was also a supervisory council member in the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions from 1920 to 1925, and board chairman of &quot;Østfold Arbeiderblad&quot; from 1921 to 1923. He was married to Kari Hansen (1893–1967) since April 1916. He was the father of Reidar Torp.

==Party chairman and cabinet member==
In 1922 Torp was a delegate at the Fourth Comintern Congress. In 1923 the revolutionary wing that had assumed power in the Labour Party in 1918 had split into two wings, one for and one against Comintern membership. Torp belonged to the latter wing, which assumed power at the 1923 national convention. Torp was elected chairman of the entire party. When he became chairman, the chairman of the party&#x27;s youth wing (Peder Furubotn) was four years older than he was. Torp chaired the party until 1945. It has often been said, however, that Martin Tranmæl was the &quot;real&quot; chairman of the Labour Party.

Torp had been a member of Sarpsborg city council from 1919 to 1923 and deputy member of Aker municipal council from 1925 to 1928 when he in 1930 moved to Oslo. He served as mayor in 1935 and 1936, and was elected to the Parliament of Norway in the 1936 Norwegian parliamentary election. By that time he had already become acting Minister of Defence in Nygaardsvold&#x27;s Cabinet, filling in for Fredrik Monsen who was ill. He was then Minister of Social Affairs from November 1936 to July 1939, and Minister of Finance from July 1939 to March 1942. In April 1940 Norway had been invaded by Nazi Germany, and Torp was responsible for initiating the successful flight of the Norwegian National Treasury. After overseeing the start of the flight, he fled together with the rest of Nygaardsvold&#x27;s Cabinet. In Åndalsnes he was injured in the foot during the German air raids. The Cabinet ultimately reached Tromsø where they embarked for England, where they stayed until the war&#x27;s end. Torp was acting Minister of Defence from November 1941 to February 1942, and then the permanent Minister of Defence from March 1942 to November 1945, in Nygaardsvold&#x27;s and Gerhardsen&#x27;s First Cabinet. Torp was a former antimilitarist, and was imprisoned for five months in 1924 as he called for a military strike, but shed this ideology from the mid-1930s.

Before the Second World War, Torp was also chairman of Bærumsbanen from 1935 to 1940, Oslo Sporveier from 1935 to 1940 and the Oslo airport committee from 1935 to 1940. He was a board member of Folketeaterbygningen from 1935 to 1940, &quot;Idrettskomiteen av 1935&quot;, and &quot;Felleskomiteen for forstadsbanene&quot; from 1935 to 1940. He was a deputy board member of Norges Kommunalbank from 1935 to 1940. All of these positions were lost when he fled the country.

==Post-war career==
The German occupation ended on 8 May 1945, and the exiled politicians returned home. Torp chaired the Government Delegation from London to Oslo on 14 May 1945, and until 31 May 1945 he was thus the acting prime minister and acting minister of foreign affairs in Oslo.

Much because of his exile, Torp was no longer found fit to be party chairman, and was replaced, against the party by-laws. He was also demoted to Minister of Provisioning and Reconstruction in Gerhardsen&#x27;s Second Cabinet. He was pressured to leave this office as well, and left on 10 January 1948. He sat through his parliamentary term to which he had been elected in 1945; until 1948 the deputy Eugen Amandus Pettersen had taken his seat. He was also the Labour Party parliamentary leader. He moved to Vestfold in 1948 as he was appointed County Governor there. After a short time, he decided to stand for election again, and in 1949 he was elected for the Market towns of Vestfold county. In the same year he was one of the architects behind the Norwegian NATO membership. During his absence from his job as county governor, Gerhard Dahl served as acting governor, since Torp was absent almost the entire time that he was governor.

==Prime minister==
In November 1951 a political shock happened in Norway as Einar Gerhardsen unexpectedly resigned as Prime Minister of Norway. Gerhardsen then asked Oscar Torp to take over. Reportedly, Gerhardsen favored Sverre Støstad, but he rejected the offer. Torp led his cabinet for four years, and also had to double as acting Minister of Trade and Shipping from 3 to 15 June 1954. Carl Henry took his seat in Parliament.

==Domestic statesmanship==
Torp was pressured to give the position back to Gerhardsen in January 1955, when Gerhardsen had strengthened himself for a few years as party chairman and President of the Storting. Torp, who was re-elected to Parliament in 1953 and 1957, succeeded Gerhardsen as President of the Storting, a position he held until his death. He was also County Governor until his death, albeit he was absent from the position for most of the time. Gunvor Katharina Eker took his seat after his death.

Torp was a member of the Labour Party central board and national board from 1945 to his death. He was also a board member of the Norwegian State Railways from 1948–1957 and chairman of the supervisory council of Folketeatret from 1948 to his death. In Vestfold he held a multitude of local chairmanships, including of the county tax board and the administration () of the Diocese of Tunsberg.

== Death ==
Torp had a cerebral haemorrhage in the early 1950s, which he kept secret to most his acquaintances, even family. On 1 May 1958 he had a new cerebral haemorrhage, this time with a fatal outcome. He died at Rikshospitalet. This was May Day, and Torp was scheduled as the main speaker in Stavanger. He was not able to do it, and thus, Arne Skaug read Torp&#x27;s manuscript. When the speech was referred to in the newspapers the next day, it was accompanied by obituaries of Torp. He was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund. A memorial stone was raised in Skjeberg in 1976.

Books about Torp include Nils Hønsvald&#x27;s &quot;Oscar Torp&quot;, released in 1959, and Egil Helle&#x27;s &quot;Oscar Torp – arbeidergutt og statsmann&quot;, released in 1983. In 2007 Hans Olav Lahlum released &quot;Oscar Torp. En politisk biografi&quot;.

<text>Pierre Louis Prieur (Prieur de la Marne) (1 August 1756 – 31 May 1827) was a French lawyer elected to the Estates-General of 1789. During the French Revolution he served as a deputy to the National Convention and held membership in the Committee of Public Safety.

==Biography==
Born in Sommesous (Marne), Prieur practised as a lawyer at Châlons-sur-Marne until 1789, when he was elected to the States-General. He became secretary to the National Constituent Assembly, and the violence of his attacks on the &quot;ancien régime&quot; won him the pun nickname of &quot;Crieur de la Marne&quot; (&quot;Shouter of the Marne&quot;).

In 1791, he became vice-president of the criminal tribunal of Paris. Re-elected to the Convention, he was sent to Normandy, where he directed bitter reprisals against the supporters of Federalism.

He voted for the death of King Louis XVI, and as a member of the Committees of National Defence and of Public Safety he was despatched in October 1793 to Brittany, where he established the local version of the Reign of Terror. In May 1794 he became president of the Convention. The Thermidorian Reaction drove him into hiding from May 1795 until the amnesty proclaimed in the autumn of that year.

He took no part in public affairs under the Directory, the Consulate or the Empire, and in 1816, after the Bourbon Restoration, he was banished as a &quot;regicide&quot;.

Prieur died in Brussels in 1827.

<text>Claude Antoine, [[Count|comte]] Prieur-Duvernois (1763–1832), commonly known as Prieur de la [[Côte-d&#x27;Or]] after his native département, was a French engineer and a politician during and after the French Revolution.

==Life==
===Early life and revolutionary beginnings===
Born in Auxonne, Côte-d&#x27;Or. As an officer of engineers, he presented to the National Constituent Assembly in 1790 a &quot;Mémoire&quot; on the standardization of weights and measures.

In 1791, the Côte-d&#x27;Or re-elected him to the Legislative Assembly, and in 1792 to the National Convention. In 1792, Prieur-Duvernois was sent on a mission to the Army of the Rhine to announce the deposition of King Louis XVI, after having voted in favor of his execution.

In 1793 he served as a representative on mission to survey the ports of Lorient and Dunkirk. He was arrested in Normandy after the fall of the Girondists (June 1793) by the rebel authorities of Caen. He was released in July 1793 after the defeat of their forces at Vernon.

===Committee of Public Safety===
On 14 August 1793, he became a member of the Committee of Public Safety, where he allied himself with Lazare Carnot in the organization of national defence. His role included providing munitions for the troops engaged in the French Revolutionary Wars. Prieur worked closely with prominent scientists in France. The Committee worked with several notable French scientists, including Lagrange, Lamarck, and Vandermonde. Prieur and Carnot advocated the use of observation balloons in war after some experiments in Meudon. This led to their deployment at the Battle of Fleurus.

With Carnot, Prieur aligned with the Reign of Terror, and voted in favor of Georges Danton&#x27;s execution. As the Committee collapsed, Prieur aligned with Carnot and Lindet, the two other specialists in the Committee.

Prieur retained his seat after the Thermidorian Reaction. He avoided capture in the riots of Prairial Insurrection (20 May 1795), and was subsequently spared the attacks of moderates in the Thermidorian Convention.

===Directory and Empire===
Under the Directory, Prieur sat in the Council of Five Hundred until Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s 18 Brumaire coup (9 November 1799). In 1808 he was created a count of the Empire, and in 1811 he retired from the army with the grade of (the equivalent of colonel).

Prieur-Duvernois was one of the founders of the &quot;École Polytechnique&quot;. In this role, he helped to establish the Institut de France, to adopt the metric system, and to found the &quot;Bureau des Longitudes&quot;. Prieur died in Dijon.

<text>The Big Board (1980) and Big Board II (1982) were Z80 based single-board computers designed by Jim Ferguson. They provided a complete CP/M compatible computer system on a single printed circuit board, including CPU, memory, disk drive interface, keyboard and video monitor interface. The printed circuit board was sized to match the Shugart 801 or 851 floppy drive. This allowed attachment to up to two 8 inch or 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drives. The Big Board II added a SASI interface for hard disk drives, enhancements to system speed (4 MHz vs. 2.5 MHz) and enhancements to the terminal interface.

One version of the Big Board was used in the Xerox 820.

==Hardware==

The Big Board was sold as an unpopulated printed circuit board with sockets for integrated circuits, with documentation and options to purchase additional components
The Big Board design was simple enough to build a system around that many people with no prior electronics experience were able to build and bring up a capable computer system of their own at a cost far less than that of a fully assembled system of the time. In this way, the Big Boards anticipated the DIY PC clones that became popular later. In its most popular form, the fully assembled and tested Big Board need only be connected to a power supply, one or two eight inch floppy disk drives, a composite monitor, and an ASCII encoded keyboard in order to provide a fully functioning system. A serial terminal could be used in place of the monitor and keyboard, further simplifying assembly. The only tool required for basic assembly was a screwdriver for the terminal block power connections.

The design was also simple to modify for the sake of system expansion and enhancement. Many different modifications to increase the system clock speed were possible, including some that required nothing more than jumpers (e.g. the 3.5 MHz speed upgrade obtained by jumpering the clock divider, with no software modifications or changes to the ICs on the board.) There was also a minor industry in user-installable system upgrades such as real time clocks, 4 MHz upgrades, double density floppy upgrades, character enhancements for the display (reverse video, blinking, etc.), and the addition of hard disk interfaces such as SASI and SCSI. Most of these upgrades were accomplished through the use of daughter boards that plugged into existing IC sockets on the board, with the original IC either replaced by a more capable IC or placed into a socket on the daughter board.

It was possible to upgrade the memory to 256 KB, which was extremely large for the time. While not directly supported by CP/M, the extra memory could be used to implement a ram disk, caching of the operating system image (to greatly improve warm boot time), or a print spooler.

The Big Board II (1982) incorporated many of the most popular upgrades for the original Big Board into its design. It also featured a small breadboard area that allowed for many simple upgrades to be performed without the addition of daughter boards.

==Software==

The Big Board was designed primarily to run the CP/M operating system, version 2.2. It came with a monitor program in ROM called PFM-80 which was the &quot;software front panel&quot; of the system. The source code listing of PFM was a feature of the first and second issues of Micro Cornucopia. PFM featured many well-documented routines that could be employed in user code.

The board featured 3 spare 2K ROM sockets that allowed for the addition of additional firmware. Popular additions were Tiny BASIC, FORTH, and enhanced versions of PFM.

==Documentation==

The Big Board came with a full set of schematics, a document titled &quot;Theory of Operation&quot;, the PFM-80 User&#x27;s Manual, instructions for assembly and testing of the Big Board, a parts list, and addenda to these. The Theory of Operation described the details of the operation of the system, including the CRT controller, floppy disk controller, serial communications, memory bank switching, and connector pinouts.

==Big Board Community==

The success of the Big Board spawned Micro Cornucopia magazine. Many Big Board kits included a subscription flyer for the magazine.

The magazine regularly featured user reports, hardware upgrade articles, and reviews of third party products. The magazine&#x27;s publisher hosted the SOG (Semi Official Get-together) annually, where the magazine&#x27;s readers would join staff and writers for white water rafting, potluck feasts, and technical discussions.

== Third Party Products==
The Xerox 820 computer was based on the Big Board; &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated that its &quot;considerable virtues ... lie mostly in its use of the Big Board&#x27;s design&quot;. Shugart Associates was a common source of floppy disk drives, as was Tandon Corporation.

Taylor Electric Company provided the &quot;Better Board&quot;, including floppy disk drive interface enhancements, enhancements to PFM, and corrections to the original assembly and testing instructions bundled with the Big Board.

SWP Microcomputer Products of Arlington, TX (formerly Software Publishers) provided the Bigboard Dual Density upgrade, which provided both hardware and software to allow the Big Board I to use dual density formats on its drives.

Micro Cornucopia provided many products to enhance the Big Board computers, including speed upgrades, utility software and development tools both on ROM and on disk, and I/O enhancements.

AB Computer Products sold enclosures, monitors, and pre-punched I/O panels targeted at Big Board users.

D&amp;W Associates of Rome, NY sold monitors, ASCII-encoded keyboards, and power supplies targeted to the Big Board market.

Paradise Valley Electronics of Moscow, ID sold a version of FORTH, as well as graphics upgrades and utility software for the Big Board.

Several manufacturers, including JBW and Andy Bakkers sold SASI interface kits.

Kuzara Enterprises of San Diego, CA (formerly Design Technology) sold printer interfaces that allowed the Big Board to use the full feature sets of the Xerox Diablo printers.

Several manufacturers provided real time clock upgrades as a CPU daughter board.

Andy Bakkers sold a 1 MB RAM Disk daughter board for Big Board II.

Kenmore Computer Technologies (from Buffalo, NY) offered the Ztime-I calendar/clock board kit and software. Calendar/clock circuits enabled early computers to time-stamp data and perform time-sensitive tasks with accuracy.

<text>The Xerox 820 Information Processor is an 8-bit desktop computer sold by Xerox in the early 1980s. The computer runs under the CP/M operating system and uses floppy disk drives for mass storage. The microprocessor board is a licensed variant of the Big Board computer.

==820==
Xerox introduced the 820 in June 1981 for $2,995 with two -inch single-density disk drives with 81K of capacity per diskette, or $3,795 with two 8-inch drives with 241K capacity. To beat the IBM PC to market, Xerox created little of the computer&#x27;s design; it is based on the Ferguson Big Board computer kit and other off-the-shelf components, including a Zilog Z80 processor clocked at 2.5 MHz, and 64 KB of RAM.

Xerox chose CP/M as its operating system because of the large software library—The 820 is compatible with all Big Board software—and sold a customized version of WordStar for $495, although by 1982 the company offered the standard version for the same price.

By 1984, surplus 820 mainboards were available from Xerox for about $50 each, and one of these could be combined with other surplus components to build a working system for a few hundred dollars.

==820-II==

===Overview===
The Xerox 820-II followed in 1982, featuring a Z80A processor clocked at 4.0 MHz. Pricing started at .

Hardware: The processor board is located inside the CRT unit, and includes the Z80A, 64 KB of RAM and a boot ROM which enables booting from any of the supported external drives in 8-bit mode.

Screen: The display is a 24-line, 80-character (7×10 dot matrix) white-on-black monochrome CRT, with software-selectable variations such as reverse video, blinking, low-intensity (equivalent to grey text), and 4×4-resolution graphics.

Communication ports: These include two 25-pin RS-232 serial ports (including one intended for a Xerox 620 or 630 printer or compatible, and one intended for a modem), and two optional parallel ports which can be added via an internal pin header, usable with a Xerox or other cable.

Keyboard: A bulky 96-character ASCII keyboard with a 10-key numeric keypad and a cursor diamond which otherwise defaults to Ctrl-A to Ctrl-D. It also includes and keys, and is attached to the back of the CRT unit by a thick cable.

Software: A typical 820-II comes with CP/M 2.2, diagnostic software, WordStar, and Microsoft&#x27;s BASIC-80 programming language.

===Expansion===

The Xerox 820-II is different from the 820:

# the 820 mainboard has a floppy disk controller (Western Digital FD1771) but no hard disk controller or any expansion bay capabilities, whereas
# the 820-II mainboard has no built-in disk controller nor a built-in processor expansion capability (these are required to be on expansion bay cards; there are two different expansion bay connectors, one which accommodates one of several disk I/O boards, and one which accommodates a processor board—the processor board was the taller of the two).

The Xerox 820-II&#x27;s disk I/O capability is on one of two different cards:

# a floppy disk I/O card, which can control external 8&quot; or 5.25&quot; floppies, or a mixture of these, as configured by special external cables, and
# a SCSI hard disk/floppy disk I/O card, which can control one external 8&quot; hard drive and one to three external 8&quot; floppy drives (these being either single- or double-sided, and either single- or double-density).

The 820-II has a processor expansion capability, which optionally supports a 16-bit Intel 8086 processor card with its own 128 KB or 256 KB of RAM (the 16-bit processor card uses the on-mainboard Z80A for all peripheral I/O operations, therefore the 8086 behaves more like a co-processor).

The 820-II&#x27;s 16-bit processor card features a true 16-bit 8086 processor, not an 8/16-bit 8088 processor as on the contemporary IBM PC.

The 16-bit processor card is, however, limited to 128 KB of DRAM (256 KB, maximum, if incorporating a rather rare RAM &quot;daughter&quot; card).

Flipping the 820-II&#x27;s console between 8-bit and 16-bit modes on an 820-II which is equipped with the optional 16-bit processor card is accomplished by a keyboard control command.

Xerox 820-II component parts were available from Xerox outlet stores at quite reasonable prices, and it was not uncommon to convert surplus (but new) 128 KB 16-bit processor cards to 512 KB by the substitution of sixteen 41256 DRAM chips for the card&#x27;s usual sixteen 4164 DRAM chips (both are 16-pin DIPs—pin 1 is unused on a 4164 and becomes A8 on a 41256), plus the addition of two ICs (one 74F02 and one 74F08, or two user-modified PALs) for controlling the 41256&#x27;s 9th address row and column (not found on 4164s), thereby achieving a four-times increase in RAM without the use of a &quot;daughter&quot; card (which can only achieve a two-times increase in RAM).

A simple modification to the 820-II&#x27;s BIOS initialization code was developed to move the BIOS image up to the top of the 512 KB RAM area, thereby giving the applications maximum contiguous RAM. Otherwise, the 512 KB of the converted processor card is segmented into a lower 128 KB segment, and an upper 384 KB segment, but CP/M-86 was designed to handle such segmented RAM, so this BIOS modification is optional, although desirable.

Unlike much later processors from Intel, and others, which offers both segmented and &quot;flat&quot; addressing, the 8086 (and the 8088) offers &quot;only&quot; segmented addressing, with each segment limited to 64 KB. By effective utilization of the four available segment registers, Code, Data, Stack and Extra, the 512 KB address space possible with the modified 820-II 8086 processor card can be very effectively managed, although in 64 KB chunks. If each &quot;data area&quot; is identified with its segment and its offset, possibly starting with zero offset, then there is little penalty associated with such segmented addressing, just as long as each individual &quot;data area&quot; does not exceed 64 KB, and most such data areas were intentionally designed so as not to exceed 64 KB.

===Disk storage===
Much CP/M software uses the Xerox 820&#x27;s disk format, and other computers such as the Kaypro II are compatible with it.
 The CRT unit contains the processor, and a large port on the back connected via heavy cable to a disk drive, allowing a wide variety of configurations. Disk drives can be daisy-chained via a port on the back.
Reference: 820-II Operation Manual

===The Basic Operating System (BOS) monitor===

The system can function to a limited extent without having to load a disk operating system: the system monitor in ROM allows, at boot-up, a variety of uses via one-letter commands followed by attributes.

A user normally uses the &quot;(L)oad&quot; command to load a bootstrap loader (i.e., for CP/M) from a floppy or the fixed disk. One can also access a &quot;(T)ypewriter&quot; mode for direct interface with the serial printer port and basic typing on screen. &quot;(H)ost terminal&quot; allows the 820-II to interface as a terminal via either of the serial ports, as specified, at up to 19.2 kbit/s.

For low-end system operations, a user can manually read or write to memory, execute code at a particular location in memory, read from or write to the system ports, or even read a sector from a disk. Further, (documented) calls to BOS subroutines allows a skilled user or program to restart the system, perform disk operations, take keyboard input, or write to the display.

==Model 16/8==
The Model 16/8, introduced in May 1983, has dual CPUs, an 8-bit Z80 and 16-bit Intel 8086, which can be booted jointly or separately. The operating system is 8-bit CP/M-80 and 16-bit CP/M-86, and the computer was supplied with the WordStar word processor and dBase II database management system. It has double 8&quot; floppy disk drives, a 12&quot; monochrome monitor and a daisywheel printer. Later in 1984 double 5.25&quot; floppy disk drives, a portrait-size blue monitor, and a laser printer were offered. The Model 16/8 is also called a Xerox 823.

Flipping the 8/16&#x27;s console between 8 bit and 16 bit modes is accomplished by a simple keyboard control command.

==Reception==
The 820 was codenamed The Worm because Xerox saw Apple Computer as its main competitor; &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported that Apple delayed and redesigned a computer under development to better compete with the 820. While less expensive than dedicated word processors such as the Xerox 860, the 820 was expensive and slow compared to personal computers; one month after its release, the Osborne 1—faster, portable, and with bundled software worth more than —appeared, while Xerox charged for the required CP/M software. The 820 did not use Xerox PARC&#x27;s sophisticated technology that influenced the Apple Macintosh.

&quot;InfoWorld&quot; in 1982 stated that &quot;The considerable virtues of the Xerox 820 lie mostly in its use of the Big Board design—its faults are, to a large extent, Xerox&#x27;s own, and in no small measure due to its rush to get the system to market&quot; before the IBM PC. The reviewer criticized the keyboard&#x27;s contact bounce, slow disk access, and &quot;pieced-together ... minimal&quot; documentation, and warned customers against the Xerox-customized WordStar. He reported that three of the four computers&#x27; disk-drive units his company had purchased had problems, and &quot;strongly recommend an 820 owner get a service contract&quot;. The reviewer concluded that while the 820 &quot;could be a fine office computer, its faults are so egregious that they indicate a basic lack of attention to detail on the part of Xerox&quot;. While noting the 8&quot; model&#x27;s low price and Xerox&#x27;s strong field service and &quot;prestige nameplate&quot;, and expressing hope that the company &quot;gets it act together&quot; and fix the keyboard and other problems, he suggested that potential customers consider building a similar computer at a lower price around the Big Board.

Xerox was the second Fortune 500 company after Tandy Corporation, and first major American office-technology company, to sell a personal computer. It had experience with large customers, unlike Apple or Tandy. &quot;InfoWorld&quot;″s reviewer stated that he and his colleagues were glad when Xerox announced the 820, because &quot;at last a recognized business-equipment manufacturer had brought out a standard CP/M&quot; computer at a low price; dealers reportedly were also pleased to sell a computer from a well-known company. The &quot;Rosen Electronics Letter&quot; also unfavorably reviewed the 820 in June 1981, however, describing it as a disappointing, &quot;me too&quot; product for a leading technology company like Xerox. In November it stated that the new IBM PC was much more attractive; &quot;we think the bulk of the sales will go to IBM&quot;. They did choose the PC, introduced one month after the 820; Yankee Group said after the latter&#x27;s discontinuation that it &quot;sort of got blown away right then and there by the IBM announcement&quot;. Xerox hoped to sell 100,000 820s in two years, but reportedly failed to do so in four; &quot;Micro Cornucopia&quot; reported in October 1983 that a dealer had thousands of 820 motherboards for sale for .95. Xerox discontinued the 16/8 and 820-II in early 1985; &quot;InfoWorld&quot;″s article stated that &quot;few will notice [their] demise&quot;. Yankee Group predicted that the company would introduce its own PC clone.

<text>Ball lightning is a rare and unexplained phenomenon described as luminescent, spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms, the observed phenomenon is reported to last considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightning bolt, and is a phenomenon distinct from St. Elmo&#x27;s fire and will-o&#x27;-the-wisp.

Some 19th-century reports describe balls that eventually explode and leave behind an odor of sulfur. Descriptions of ball lightning appear in a variety of accounts over the centuries and have received attention from scientists. An optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball lightning event was published in January 2014 and included a video at high frame rate.
Nevertheless, scientific data on ball lightning remain scarce.
Although laboratory experiments have produced effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, how these relate to the supposed phenomenon remains unclear.

== Characteristics ==
Descriptions of ball lightning vary widely. It has been described as moving up and down, sideways or in unpredictable trajectories, hovering and moving with or against the wind; attracted to, unaffected by, or repelled from buildings, people, cars and other objects. Some accounts describe it as moving through solid masses of wood or metal without effect, while others describe it as destructive and melting or burning those substances. Its appearance has also been linked to power lines, altitudes of and higher, and during thunderstorms and calm weather. Ball lightning has been described as transparent, translucent, multicolored, evenly lit, radiating flames, filaments or sparks, with shapes that vary between spheres, ovals, tear-drops, rods, or disks.

Ball lightning is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo&#x27;s fire. They are separate and distinct phenomena.

The balls have been reported to disperse in many different ways, such as suddenly vanishing, gradually dissipating, being absorbed into an object, &quot;popping,&quot; exploding loudly, or even exploding with force, which is sometimes reported as damaging. Accounts also vary on their alleged danger to humans, from lethal to harmless.

A review of the available literature published in 1972 identified the properties of a &quot;typical&quot; ball lightning, whilst cautioning against over-reliance on eye-witness accounts:
* They frequently appear almost simultaneously with cloud-to-ground lightning discharge
* They are generally spherical or pear-shaped with fuzzy edges
* Their diameters range from , most commonly 
* Their brightness corresponds to roughly that of a domestic lamp, so they can be seen clearly in daylight
* A wide range of colors has been observed, with red, orange, and yellow being the most common
* The lifetime of each event is from one second to over a minute with the brightness remaining fairly constant during that time
* They tend to move at a few meters per second, most often in a horizontal direction, but may also move vertically, remain stationary, or wander erratically
* Many are described as having rotational motion
* It is rare that observers report the sensation of heat, although in some cases the disappearance of the ball is accompanied by the liberation of heat
* Some display an affinity for metal objects and may move along conductors such as wires, metal fences, or railroad tracks
* Some appear within buildings passing through closed doors and windows
* Some have appeared within metal aircraft and have entered and left without causing damage
* The disappearance of a ball is generally rapid and may be either silent or explosive
* Odors resembling ozone, burning sulphur, or nitrogen oxides are often reported

== Historical accounts ==
Ball lightning is a possible source of legends that describe luminous balls, such as the mythological Anchimayen from Argentinean and Chilean Mapuche culture.

According to a statistical investigation carried out in 1960, of 1,962 Oak Ridge National Laboratory monthly role personnel, and of all 15,923 Union Carbide Nuclear Company personnel in Oak Ridge, found 5.6% and 3.1% respectively reported seeing ball lightning. A Scientific American article summarized the study as having found that ball lightning had been seen by 5% of the population of the Earth. Another study analyzed reports of more than 2,000 cases.

=== Gervase of Canterbury ===
The chronicle of Gervase of Canterbury, an English monk, contains what is possibly the earliest known reference to ball lightning, dated 7 June 1195. He states, &quot;A marvellous sign descended near London&quot;, consisting of a dense and dark cloud, emitting a white substance that grew into a spherical shape under the cloud, from which a fiery globe fell towards the river.

Physicist Emeritus Professor Brian Tanner and historian Giles Gasper of Durham University identified the chronicle entry as probably describing ball lightning, and noted its similarity to other accounts:
=== Great Thunderstorm of Widecombe-in-the-Moor ===

One early account reports on the Great Thunderstorm at a church in Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon, in England, on 21 October 1638. Four people died and approximately 60 suffered injuries during a severe storm. Witnesses described an ball of fire striking and entering the church, nearly destroying it. Large stones from the church walls were hurled onto the ground and through large wooden beams. The ball of fire allegedly smashed the pews and many windows, and filled the church with a foul sulphurous odour and dark, thick smoke.

The ball of fire reportedly divided into two segments, one exiting through a window by smashing it open, the other disappearing somewhere inside the church. Because of the fire and sulphur smell, contemporaries explained the ball of fire as &quot;the devil&quot; or as the &quot;flames of hell&quot;. Later, some blamed the entire incident on two people who had been playing cards in the pews during the sermon, thereby incurring God&#x27;s wrath.

=== The sloop &quot;Catherine and Mary&quot; ===
In December 1726, a number of British newspapers printed an extract of a letter from John Howell of the sloop &quot;Catherine and Mary&quot;:

=== HMS &quot;Montague&quot; ===
One particularly large example was reported &quot;on the authority of Dr. Gregory&quot; in 1749:

Admiral Chambers on board the &quot;Montague&quot;, 4 November 1749, was taking an observation just before noon...he observed a large ball of blue fire about distant from them. They immediately lowered their topsails, but it came up so fast upon them, that, before they could raise the main tack, they observed the ball rise almost perpendicularly, and not above from the main chains when it went off with an explosion, as great as if a hundred cannons had been discharged at the same time, leaving behind it a strong sulphurous smell. By this explosion the main top-mast was shattered into pieces and the main mast went down to the keel.

Five men were knocked down and one of them very bruised. Just before the explosion, the ball seemed to be the size of a large mill-stone.

=== Georg Richmann ===
A 1753 report recounts lethal ball lightning when professor Georg Richmann of Saint Petersburg, Russia, constructed a kite-flying apparatus similar to Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s proposal a year earlier. Richmann was attending a meeting of the Academy of Sciences when he heard thunder and ran home with his engraver to capture the event for posterity. While the experiment was under way, ball lightning appeared, travelled down the string, struck Richmann&#x27;s forehead and killed him. The ball had left a red spot on Richmann&#x27;s forehead, his shoes were blown open, and his clothing was singed. His engraver was knocked unconscious. The door-frame of the room was split and the door was torn from its hinges.

=== HMS &quot;Warren Hastings&quot; ===
An English journal reported that during an 1809 storm, three &quot;balls of fire&quot; appeared and &quot;attacked&quot; the British ship &quot;HMS Warren Hastings&quot;. The crew watched one ball descend, killing a man on deck and setting the main mast on fire. A crewman went out to retrieve the fallen body and was struck by a second ball, which knocked him back and left him with mild burns. A third man was killed by contact with the third ball. Crew members reported a persistent, sickening sulphur smell afterward.

=== Ebenezer Cobham Brewer ===
Ebenezer Cobham Brewer, in his 1864 US edition of &quot;A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar&quot;, discusses &quot;globular lightning&quot;. He describes it as slow-moving balls of fire or explosive gas that sometimes fall to the earth or run along the ground during a thunderstorm. He said that the balls sometimes split into smaller balls and may explode &quot;like a cannon&quot;.

=== Wilfrid de Fonvielle ===
In his book &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;, translated into English in 1875, French science-writer Wilfrid de Fonvielle wrote that there had been about 150 reports of globular lightning:

Globular lightning seems to be particularly attracted to metals; thus it will seek the railings of balconies, or else water or gas pipes etc., It has no peculiar tint of its own but will appear of any colour as the case may be ... at Coethen in the Duchy of Anhalt it appeared green. M. Colon, Vice-President of the Geological Society of Paris, saw a ball of lightning descend slowly from the sky along the bark of a poplar tree; as soon as it touched the earth it bounced up again, and disappeared without exploding. On 10th of September 1845 a ball of lightning entered the kitchen of a house in the village of Salagnac in the valley of Correze. This ball rolled across without doing any harm to two women and a young man who were here; but on getting into an adjoining stable it exploded and killed a pig which happened to be shut up there, and which, knowing nothing about the wonders of thunder and lightning, dared to smell it in the most rude and unbecoming manner.

The motion of such balls is far from being very rapid – they have even been observed occasionally to pause in their course, but they are not the less destructive for all that. A ball of lightning which entered the church of Stralsund, on exploding, projected a number of balls which exploded in their turn like shells.

=== Tsar Nicholas II ===
Nicholas II, the final tsar of the Russian Empire, reported witnessing a fiery ball as a child attending church in the company of his grandfather Alexander II.

Once my parents were away, and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and it seemed as if the peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather – his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms.

=== Aleister Crowley ===
British occultist Aleister Crowley reported witnessing what he referred to as &quot;globular electricity&quot; during a thunderstorm on Lake Pasquaney in New Hampshire, United States, in 1916. He was sheltered in a small cottage when he, in his own words,

...noticed, with what I can only describe as calm amazement, that a dazzling globe of electric fire, apparently between in diameter, was stationary about below and to the right of my right knee. As I looked at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock in the middle of my right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body.

===R. C. Jennison===
Jennison, of the Electronics Laboratory at the University of Kent, described his own observation of ball lightning in an article published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1969:

I was seated near the front of the passenger cabin of an all-metal airliner (Eastern Airlines Flight EA 539) on a late night flight from New York to Washington. The aircraft encountered an electrical storm during which it was enveloped in a sudden bright and loud electrical discharge (0005 h EST, March 19, 1963). Some seconds after this a glowing sphere a little more than in diameter emerged from the pilot&#x27;s cabin and passed down the aisle of the aircraft approximately from me, maintaining the same height and course for the whole distance over which it could be observed. 

=== Other accounts ===
* Willy Ley discussed a sighting in Paris on 5 July 1852 &quot;for which sworn statements were filed with the French Academy of Science&quot;. During a thunderstorm, a tailor living next to Church of the Val-de-Grâce saw a ball the size of a human head come out of the fireplace. It flew around the room, reentered the fireplace, and exploded in and destroyed the top of the chimney.
* On 30 April 1877 a ball of lightning entered the Golden Temple at Amritsar, India, and exited through a side door. Several people observed the ball, and the incident is inscribed on the front wall of Darshani Deori.
* On 22 November 1894 an unusually prolonged instance of natural ball lightning occurred in Golden, Colorado, which suggests it could be artificially induced from the atmosphere. The &quot;Golden Globe&quot; newspaper reported:

:A beautiful yet strange phenomenon was seen in this city on last Monday night. The wind was high and the air seemed to be full of electricity. In front of, above and around the new Hall of Engineering of the School of Mines, balls of fire played tag for half an hour, to the wonder and amazement of all who saw the display. In this building is situated the dynamos and electrical apparatus of perhaps the finest electrical plant of its size in the state. There was probably a visiting delegation from the clouds, to the captives of the dynamos on last Monday night, and they certainly had a fine visit and a roystering game of romp.

* On 22 May 1901 in the Kazakh city of Ouralsk in the Russian Empire (now Oral, Kazakhstan), &quot;a dazzlingly brilliant ball of fire&quot; descended gradually from the sky during a thunderstorm, then entered into a house where 21 people had taken refuge, &quot;wreaked havoc with the apartment, broke through the wall into a stove in the adjoining room, smashed the stove-pipe, and carried it off with such violence that it was dashed against the opposite wall, and went out through the broken window&quot;. The incident was reported in the &quot;Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France&quot; the following year.
* In July 1907 ball lightning hit the Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse in Western Australia. Lighthouse-keeper Patrick Baird was in the tower at the time and was knocked unconscious. His daughter Ethel recorded the event.
* Ley discussed another incident in Bischofswerda, Germany. On 29 April 1925 multiple witnesses saw a silent ball land near a mailman, move along a telephone wire to a school, knock back a teacher using a telephone, and bore perfectly round coin-sized holes through a glass pane. of wire was melted, several telephone poles were damaged, an underground cable was broken, and several workmen were thrown to the ground but unhurt. 
* An early reference to ball lightning appears in a children&#x27;s book set in the 19th century by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The books are considered historical fiction, but the author always insisted they were descriptive of actual events in her life. In Wilder&#x27;s description, three separate balls of lightning appear during a winter blizzard near a cast-iron stove in the family&#x27;s kitchen. They are described as appearing near the stovepipe, then rolling across the floor, only to disappear as the mother (Caroline Ingalls) chases them with a willow-branch broom.
* Pilots in World War II (1939–1945) described an unusual phenomenon for which ball lightning has been suggested as an explanation. The pilots saw small balls of light moving in strange trajectories, which came to be referred to as foo fighters.
* Submariners in World War II gave the most frequent and consistent accounts of small ball lightning in the confined submarine atmosphere. There are repeated accounts of inadvertent production of floating explosive balls when the battery banks were switched in or out, especially if misswitched or when the highly inductive electrical motors were misconnected or disconnected. An attempt later to duplicate those balls with a surplus submarine battery resulted in several failures and an explosion.
* On 6 August 1994 a ball lightning is believed to have gone through a closed window in Uppsala, Sweden, leaving a circular hole about in diameter. The hole in the window was found days later, and it was thought it could have happened during the thunderstorm; a lightning strike was witnessed by residents in the area, and was recorded by a lightning strike tracking system at the Division for Electricity and Lightning Research at Uppsala University.
* In 2005 an incident occurred in Guernsey, where an apparent lightning-strike on an aircraft led to multiple fireball sightings on the ground. 
* On 10 July 2011, during a powerful thunderstorm, a ball of light with a tail went through a window to the control room of local emergency services in Liberec in the Czech Republic. The ball bounced from window to ceiling, then to the floor and back, where it rolled along it for two or three meters. It then dropped to the floor and disappeared. The staff present in the control room were frightened, smelled electricity and burned cables and thought something was burning. The computers froze (not crashed) and all communications equipment was knocked out for the night until restored by technicians. Aside from damages caused by disrupting equipment, only one computer monitor was destroyed.
* On 15 December 2014, Loganair Flight 6780 in Scotland experienced ball lightning in the forward cabin just before lightning struck the aircraft nose, the plane fell several thousand feet and came within 1,100 feet of the North Sea before making an emergency landing at Aberdeen Airport.
* On June 24, 2022, in a massive thunderstorm front, a retired lady at Liebenberg, Lower Austria, saw blinding cloud-to-ground lightning to the northeast and within 1 min spotted a yellowish &quot;burning object with licking flames&quot; that followed a wavy trajectory along the local road about 15 m over ground and was lost from sight after 2 seconds. It occurred at the end of a local thunderstorm cell. The European Severe Storms Laboratory recorded this as ball lightning.

== Direct measurements of natural ball lightning ==
In January 2014, scientists from Northwest Normal University in Lanzhou, China, published the results of recordings made in July 2012 of the optical spectrum of what was thought to be natural ball lightning made by chance during the study of ordinary cloud–ground lightning on the Tibetan Plateau. At a distance of , a total of 1.64 seconds of digital video of the ball lightning and its spectrum was made, from the formation of the ball lightning after the ordinary lightning struck the ground, up to the optical decay of the phenomenon. Additional video was recorded by a high-speed (3000 frames/sec) camera, which captured only the last 0.78 seconds of the event, due to its limited recording capacity. Both cameras were equipped with slitless spectrographs. The researchers detected emission lines of neutral atomic silicon, calcium, iron, nitrogen, and oxygen—in contrast with mainly ionized nitrogen emission lines in the spectrum of the parent lightning. The ball lightning traveled horizontally across the video frame at an average speed equivalent of . It had a diameter of and covered a distance of about within those 1.64 s.

Oscillations in the light intensity and in the oxygen and nitrogen emission at a frequency of 100 hertz, possibly caused by the electromagnetic field of the 50 Hz high-voltage power transmission line in the vicinity, were observed. From the spectrum, the temperature of the ball lightning was assessed as being lower than the temperature of the parent lightning (&lt;15,000 to 30,000 K). The observed data are consistent with vaporization of soil as well as with ball lightning&#x27;s sensitivity to electric fields.

== Laboratory experiments ==
Scientists have long attempted to produce ball lightning in laboratory experiments. While some experiments have produced effects that are visually similar to reports of natural ball lightning, it has not yet been determined whether there is any relation.

Nikola Tesla reportedly could artificially produce balls and conducted some demonstrations of his ability. Tesla was more interested in higher voltages and powers as well as remote transmission of power; the balls he made were just a curiosity.

The International Committee on Ball Lightning (ICBL) held regular symposia on the subject. A related group uses the generic name &quot;Unconventional Plasmas&quot;. The last ICBL symposium was tentatively scheduled for July 2012 in San Marcos, Texas but was cancelled due to a lack of submitted abstracts.

=== Wave-guided microwaves ===
Ohtsuki and Ofuruton described producing &quot;plasma fireballs&quot; by microwave interference within an air-filled cylindrical cavity fed by a rectangular waveguide using a 2.45 GHz, 5 kW (maximum power) microwave oscillator.

=== Water discharge experiments ===

Some scientific groups, including the Max Planck Institute, have reportedly produced a ball lightning-type effect by discharging a high-voltage capacitor in a tank of water.

=== Home microwave oven experiments ===
Many modern experiments involve using a microwave oven to produce small rising glowing balls, often referred to as &quot;plasma balls&quot;.
Generally, the experiments are conducted by placing a lit or recently extinguished match or other small object in a microwave oven. The burnt portion of the object flares up into a large ball of fire, while &quot;plasma balls&quot; float near the oven chamber ceiling. Some experiments describe covering the match with an inverted glass jar, which contains both the flame and the balls so that they do not damage the chamber walls. (A glass jar, however, eventually explodes rather than simply causing charred paint or melting metal, as happens to the inside of a microwave.) Experiments by Eli Jerby and Vladimir Dikhtyar in Israel revealed that microwave plasma balls are made up of nanoparticles with an average radius of . The team demonstrated the phenomenon with copper, salts, water and carbon.

=== Silicon experiments ===
Experiments in 2007 involved shocking silicon wafers with electricity, which vaporizes the silicon and induces oxidation in the vapors. The visual effect can be described as small glowing, sparkling orbs that roll around a surface. Two Brazilian scientists, Antonio Pavão and Gerson Paiva of the Federal University of Pernambuco have reportedly consistently made small long-lasting balls using this method. These experiments stemmed from the theory that ball lightning is actually oxidized silicon vapors &quot;(see vaporized silicon hypothesis, below)&quot;.

== Proposed scientific explanations ==
There is at present no widely accepted explanation for ball lightning. Several hypotheses have been advanced since the phenomenon was brought into the scientific realm by the English physician and electrical researcher William Snow Harris in 1843, and French Academy scientist François Arago in 1855.

=== Vaporized silicon hypothesis ===
This hypothesis suggests that ball lightning consists of vaporized silicon burning through oxidation. Lightning striking Earth&#x27;s soil could vaporize the silica contained within it, and somehow separate the oxygen from the silicon dioxide, turning it into pure silicon vapor. As it cools, the silicon could condense into a floating aerosol, bound by its charge, glowing due to the heat of silicon recombining with oxygen. An experimental investigation of this effect, published in 2007, reported producing &quot;luminous balls with lifetime in the order of seconds&quot; by evaporating pure silicon with an electric arc. Videos and spectrographs of this experiment have been made available. This hypothesis got significant supportive data in 2014, when the first ever recorded spectra of natural ball lightning were published. The theorized forms of silicon storage in soil include nanoparticles of Si, SiO, and SiC.
Matthew Francis has dubbed this the &quot;dirt clod hypothesis&quot;, in which the spectrum of ball lightning shows that it shares chemistry with soil.

=== Electrically charged solid-core model ===
In this model ball lightning is assumed to have a solid, positively charged core. According to this underlying assumption, the core is surrounded by a thin electron layer with a charge nearly equal in magnitude to that of the core. A vacuum exists between the core and the electron layer containing an intense electromagnetic (EM) field, which is reflected and guided by the electron layer. The microwave EM field applies a ponderomotive force (radiation pressure) to the electrons preventing them from falling into the core.

=== Microwave cavity hypothesis ===
Pyotr Kapitsa proposed that ball lightning is a glow discharge driven by microwave radiation that is guided to the ball along lines of ionized air from lightning clouds where it is produced. The ball serves as a resonant microwave cavity, automatically adjusting its radius to the wavelength of the microwave radiation so that resonance is maintained.

The Handel Maser-Soliton theory of ball lightning hypothesizes that the energy source generating the ball lightning is a large (several cubic kilometers) atmospheric maser. The ball lightning appears as a plasma caviton at the antinodal plane of the microwave radiation from the maser.

In 2017, Researchers from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China, proposed that the bright glow of lightning balls is created when microwaves become trapped inside a plasma bubble. At the tip of a lightning stroke reaching the ground, a relativistic electron bunch can be produced when in contact with microwave radiation.
 The latter ionizes the local air and the radiation pressure evacuates the resulting plasma, forming a spherical plasma bubble that stably traps the radiation. Microwaves trapped inside the ball continue to generate plasma for a moment to maintain the bright flashes described in observer accounts. The ball eventually fades as the radiation held within the bubble starts to decay and microwaves are discharged from the sphere. The lightning balls can dramatically explode as the structure destabilizes. The theory could explain many of the strange characteristics of ball lightning. For instance, microwaves are able to pass through glass, which helps to explain why balls could be formed indoors.

=== Soliton hypothesis ===
Julio Rubinstein, David Finkelstein, and James R. Powell proposed that ball lightning is a detached St. Elmo&#x27;s fire (1964–1970). St. Elmo&#x27;s fire arises when a sharp conductor, such as a ship&#x27;s mast, amplifies the atmospheric electric field to breakdown. For a globe the amplification factor is 3. A free ball of ionized air can amplify the ambient field this much by its own conductivity. When this maintains the ionization, the ball is then a soliton in the flow of atmospheric electricity.

Powell&#x27;s kinetic theory calculation found that the ball size is set by the second Townsend coefficient (the mean free path of conduction electrons) near breakdown. Wandering glow discharges are found to occur within certain industrial microwave ovens and continue to glow for several seconds after power is shut off. Arcs drawn from high-power low-voltage microwave generators also are found to exhibit afterglow. Powell measured their spectra, and found that the after-glow comes mostly from metastable NO ions, which are long-lived at low temperatures. It occurred in air and in nitrous oxide, which possess such metastable ions, and not in atmospheres of argon, carbon dioxide, or helium, which do not.

The soliton model of a ball lightning was further developed. It was suggested that a ball lightning is based on spherically symmetric nonlinear oscillations of charged particles in plasma – the analogue of a spatial Langmuir soliton. These oscillations were described in both classical and quantum approaches. It was found that the most intense plasma oscillations occur in the central regions of a ball lightning. It is suggested that bound states of radially oscillating charged particles with oppositely oriented spins – the analogue of Cooper pairs – can appear inside a ball lightning. This phenomenon, in its turn, can lead to a superconducting phase in a ball lightning. The idea of the superconductivity in a ball lightning was considered earlier. The possibility of the existence of a ball lightning with a composite core was also discussed in this model.

=== Hydrodynamic vortex ring antisymmetry ===
One theory that may account for the wide spectrum of observational evidence is the idea of combustion inside the low-velocity region of spherical vortex breakdown of a natural vortex (e.g., the &#x27;Hill&#x27;s spherical vortex&#x27;).

=== Nanobattery hypothesis ===
Oleg Meshcheryakov suggests that ball lightning is made of composite nano or submicrometer particles—each particle constituting a battery. A surface discharge shorts these batteries, causing a current that forms the ball. His model is described as an aerosol model that explains all the observable properties and processes of ball lightning.

=== Buoyant plasma hypothesis ===
The declassified Project Condign report concludes that buoyant charged plasma formations similar to ball lightning are formed by novel physical, electrical, and magnetic phenomena, and that these charged plasmas are capable of being transported at enormous speeds under the influence and balance of electrical charges in the atmosphere. These plasmas appear to originate due to more than one set of weather and electrically charged conditions, the scientific rationale for which is incomplete or not fully understood. One suggestion is that meteoroids breaking up in the atmosphere and forming charged plasmas as opposed to burning completely or impacting as meteorites could explain some instances of the phenomena, in addition to other unknown atmospheric events. However, according to Stenhoff, this explanation is considered insufficient to explain the ball lightning phenomenon, and would likely not withstand peer review.

=== Hallucinations induced by magnetic field ===
Cooray and Cooray (2008) stated that the features of hallucinations experienced by patients having epileptic seizures in the occipital lobe are similar to the observed features of ball lightning. The study also showed that the rapidly changing magnetic field of a close lightning flash is strong enough to excite the neurons in the brain. This strengthens the possibility of lightning-induced seizure in the occipital lobe of a person close to a lightning strike, establishing the connection between epileptic hallucination mimicking ball lightning and thunderstorms.

More recent research with transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown to give the same hallucination results in the laboratory (termed magnetophosphenes), and these conditions have been shown to occur in nature near lightning strikes.
This hypothesis fails to explain observed physical damage caused by ball lightning or simultaneous observation by multiple witnesses. (At the very least, observations would differ substantially.)

Theoretical calculations from University of Innsbruck researchers suggest that the magnetic fields involved in certain types of lightning strikes could potentially induce visual hallucinations resembling ball lightning. Such fields, which are found within close distances to a point in which multiple lightning strikes have occurred over a few seconds, can directly cause the neurons in the visual cortex to fire, resulting in magnetophosphenes (magnetically induced visual hallucinations).

=== Rydberg matter concept ===
Manykin et al. have suggested atmospheric Rydberg matter as an explanation of ball lightning phenomena. Rydberg matter is a condensed form of highly excited atoms in many aspects similar to electron-hole droplets in semiconductors. However, in contrast to electron-hole droplets, Rydberg matter has an extended life-time—as long as hours. This condensed excited state of matter is supported by experiments, mainly of a group led by Holmlid. It is similar to a liquid or solid state of matter with extremely low (gas-like) density. Lumps of atmospheric Rydberg matter can result from condensation of highly excited atoms that form by atmospheric electrical phenomena, mainly from linear lightning. Stimulated decay of Rydberg matter clouds can, however, take the form of an avalanche, and so appear as an explosion.

=== Vacuum hypothesis ===
In December 1899, Nikola Tesla theorized that the balls consisted of a highly rarefied hot gas.

===Electron-ion model===
Fedosin presented a model in which charged ions are located inside the ball lightning, and electrons rotate in the shell, creating a magnetic field.

The long-term stability of ball lightning is ensured by the balance of electric and magnetic forces. The electric force acting on the electrons from the positive volume charge of the ions is the centripetal force that holds the electrons in place as they rotate. In turn, the ions are held by the magnetic field, which causes them to rotate around the magnetic field lines. The model predicts a maximum diameter of 34 cm for ball lightning, with the lightning having a charge of about 10 microcoulombs and being positively charged, and the energy of the lightning reaching 11 kilojoules.

The electron-ion model describes not only ball lightning, but also bead lightning, which usually occurs when linear lightning disintegrates. Based on the known dimensions of the beads of bead lightning, it is possible to calculate the electric charge of a single bead and its magnetic field. The electric forces of repulsion of neighboring beads are balanced by the magnetic forces of their attraction. Since the electromagnetic forces between the beads significantly exceed the force of the wind pressure, the beads remain in their places until the moment of extinction of the bead lightning.

=== Other hypotheses ===
Several other hypotheses have been proposed to explain ball lightning:

* Spinning electric dipole hypothesis. A 1976 article by V. G. Endean postulated that ball lightning could be described as an electric field vector spinning in the microwave frequency region.
* Electrostatic Leyden jar models. Stanley Singer discussed (1971) this type of hypothesis and suggested that the electrical recombination time would be too short for the ball lightning lifetimes often reported.
* Smirnov proposed (1987) a fractal aerogel hypothesis.
* M. I. Zelikin proposed (2006) an explanation (with a rigorous mathematical foundation) based on the hypothesis of plasma superconductivity (see also).
* A. Meessen presented a theory at the 10th International Symposium on Ball Lightning (June 21–27, 2010, Kaliningrad, Russia) explaining all known properties of ball lightning in terms of collective oscillations of free electrons. The simplest case corresponds to radial oscillations in a spherical plasma membrane. These oscillations are sustained by parametric amplification, resulting from regular &quot;inhalation&quot; of charged particles that are present at lower densities in the ambient air. Ball lightning vanishes thus by silent extinction when the available density of charged particles is too low, while it disappears with a loud and sometimes very violent explosion when this density is too high. Electronic oscillations are also possible as stationary waves in a plasma ball or thick plasma membrane. This yields concentric luminous bubbles.

<text>A single-board computer (SBC) is a complete computer built on a single circuit board, with microprocessor(s), memory, input/output (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. Single-board computers are commonly made as demonstration or development systems, for educational systems, or for use as embedded computer controllers. Many types of home computers or portable computers integrate all their functions onto a single printed circuit board.

Unlike a desktop personal computer, single-board computers often do not rely on expansion slots for peripheral functions or expansion. Single-board computers have been built using a wide range of microprocessors. Simple designs, such as those built by computer hobbyists, often use static RAM and low-cost 32- or 64-bit processors like ARM. Other types, such as blade servers, would perform similar to a server computer, only in a more compact format.

A computer-on-module is a type of single-board computer made to plug into a carrier board, baseboard, or backplane for system expansion.

==History==

The first true single-board computer was based on the Intel C8080A, also using Intel&#x27;s first EPROM, the C1702A. Schematics for the machine, called the &quot;dyna-micro&quot; were published in &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; magazine in May 1976. Later that year, production of the system began by E&amp;L Instruments, a Derby, Connecticut-based computer manufacturer, which branded the system as the &quot;Mini Micro Designer 1&quot;, intending it for use as a programmable microcontroller for prototyping electronic products. The MMD-1 was made famous as an example microcomputer in popular 8080 instruction series of the time.

Early SBCs figured heavily in the early history of home computers, such as the Acorn Electron and the BBC Micro, also developed by Acorn. Other typical early single-board computers like the KIM-1 were often shipped without enclosure, which had to be added by the owner. Other early examples are the Ferguson Big Board, the Ampro Little Board, and the Nascom. Many home computers in the 1980s were single-board computers, with some even encouraging owners to solder upgraded components directly to pre-marked points on the board.

As the PC became more prevalent, SBCs decreased in market share due to their low extensibility. The rapid adoption of IBM&#x27;s standards for peripherals and the standardization of the PCI bus in the 1990s made motherboards and compatible components and peripherals cheap and ubiquitous, while the development of multimedia platforms such as the CD-ROM and Sound Blaster cards had begun to fast outpace the rate at which users needed to replace their personal computers. These two trends disincentivized single-board computers, and instead encouraged the proliferation of motherboards, which typically housed the CPU and other core components, with peripheral components such as hard disk drive controllers and graphics processors, and even some core components such as RAM modules, located on daughterboards.

Computers began to move back towards fewer boards in the 2000s. As new standards like USB dramatically reduced the variety of peripheral standards motherboards were expected to support, advances in integrated circuit manufacturing provided new chipsets which could provide the functionality of many daughterboards, particularly I/O, in a single chip. By the end of the decade, PC motherboards offered on-board support for disk drives including IDE, SATA, NVMe, RAID, integrated GPU, Ethernet, and traditional I/O such as serial port and parallel port, USB, and keyboard/mouse support. Plug-in &quot;cards&quot; retained their importance as high performance components, such as physically large and complex graphics coprocessors, high-end RAID controllers, and specialized I/O cards such as data acquisition and DSP boards.

The 2010s were defined by rapid and sustained growth in single-board computers, enabled largely by advances in integrated circuit production techniques that made it possible for the first time to include most or all of the core components of a motherboard on a single integrated circuit die. One of the more well known single-board-computers of the decade was the Raspberry Pi, which was built around a custom Broadcom SoC with open-source drivers. Originally intended for education, the Raspberry Pi contained a number of features, such as optimized Linux support and programmable GPIO pins, that were also greatly appealing to hobbyists, who used the Pi, and other comparable SBCs, for projects such as home automation, video game emulation, media streaming, and other experimentation. In industry, the rapid growth of smartphones and other small-scale devices encouraged hardware manufacturers to move towards more frequent use of SoCs and the reduction of motherboards in size, extensibility and complexity, while the proliferation of the Internet of Things increased demand for small, cheap components that would allow unconventional devices to access the Internet. Both of these factors dramatically increased production of single-board computers throughout the decade.

By the mid 2020s, many devices, including smartphones, tablet computers, laptops and other smart devices, are powered by single-board computers which utilize advanced SoCs (System on a Chip). While this has greatly increased performance and power efficiency, it has raised concerns that single-board computers, particularly those built around SoCs, are harder to repair and may be less friendly to attempts to monitor or modify instructions programmed into the boards by manufacturers. The introduction of AI-enabled SBCs, advancements in chip integration, and the rise of eco-friendly designs have further driven the evolution of these systems. Raspberry Pi, which gained massive popularity for education and hobbyist projects, went public in 2024, demonstrating the significant demand for SBCs across industries. Modern SBCs now cater to industrial automation, IoT devices, machine learning, and edge computing. Educational SBCs continue to provide accessible platforms for learning programming and electronics, while their industrial counterparts are critical for innovative technologies like autonomous systems.

However, concerns remain about repairability and sustainability. Single-board computers, particularly those built around SoCs, are often harder to repair and less friendly to modifications or monitoring. This has sparked discussions about right-to-repair legislation and the development of more sustainable and modular designs, addressing these concerns while ensuring continued innovation in SBC technology.

==Applications==
Single-board computers were made possible by increasing the density of integrated circuits. A single-board configuration reduces a system&#x27;s overall cost, by reducing the number of circuit boards required, and by eliminating connectors and bus driver circuits that would otherwise be used. By putting all the functions on one board, a smaller overall system can be obtained, for example, as in notebook computers. Connectors are a frequent source of reliability problems, so a single-board system eliminates these problems.

Single-board computers are now commonly defined across two distinct architectures: no slots and slot support.

Embedded SBCs are units providing all the required I/O with no provision for plug-in cards. Applications are typically gaming (slot machines, video poker), kiosk, and machine control automation. Embedded SBCs are much smaller than the ATX-type motherboard found in PCs, and provide an I/O mix more targeted to an industrial application, such as on-board digital and analog I/O, on-board bootable flash memory (eliminating the need for a disk drive), no video, etc.

The term &quot;single-board computer&quot; now generally applies to an architecture where the single-board computer is plugged into a backplane to provide for I/O cards. In the case of PC104, the bus is not a backplane in the traditional sense but is a series of pin connectors allowing I/O boards to be stacked.

Single-board computers are most commonly used in industrial situations where they are used in rackmount format for process control or embedded within other devices to provide control and interfacing. They are used in deep-sea exploration on the ALICE deep sea probes and in outer space, on the Ariane and Pegasus rockets and Space Shuttle. Because of the very high levels of integration, reduced component counts and reduced connector counts, SBCs are often smaller, lighter, more power efficient and more reliable than comparable multi-board computers.

The primary advantage of an ATX motherboard as compared to an SBC is cost. Motherboards are manufactured by the millions for the consumer and office markets allowing tremendous economies of scale. Single-board computers are a market niche and are manufactured less often and at a higher cost. Motherboards and SBCs now offer similar levels of feature integration meaning that a motherboard failure in either standard will require equivalent replacement.

==Types, standards==
Ranges of single-board computers include Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, Nano Pi, Orange Pi and Banana Pi.

One common variety of single-board computer uses standardized computer form factors intended for use in a backplane enclosure. Some of these types are CompactPCI, PXI, VMEbus, VXI, and PICMG. SBCs have been built around various internal processing structures including the Intel architecture, multiprocessing architectures, and lower power processing systems like RISC and SPARC. In the Intel PC world, the intelligence and interface/control circuitry is placed on a plug-in board that is then inserted into a passive (or active) backplane. The result is similar to having a system built with a motherboard, except that the backplane determines the slot configuration. Backplanes are available with a mix of slots (ISA, PCI, PCI-X, PCI-Express, etc.), usually totaling 20 or fewer, meaning it will fit in a 19&quot; rackmount enclosure (17&quot; wide chassis).
Some single-board computers have connectors that allow a stack of circuit boards, each containing expansion hardware, to be assembled without a traditional backplane. Examples of stacking SBC form factors include PC/104, PC/104-&quot;Plus&quot;, PCI-104, EPIC, and EBX; these systems are commonly available for use in embedded control systems.

Stack-type SBCs often have memory provided on plug-cards such as SIMMs and DIMMs. Hard drive circuit boards are also not counted for determining if a computer is an SBC or not for two reasons, firstly because the HDD is regarded as a single block storage unit, and secondly because the SBC may not require a hard drive at all as most can be booted from their network connections.

<text>Mycron was a pioneer manufacturer of microcomputers, located in Oslo, Norway.

Originally named Norsk Data Industri, the company was founded in 1975 by Lars Monrad Krohn, who was also one of the founding fathers of Norsk Data. Among the employees are Arne Maus (1986–89) and Gisle Hannemyr.
The company was renamed MySoft in 1999.

==Computers manufactured by Mycron==
MYCRO-1 was an Intel 8080 machine, running the &quot;MYCROP&quot;operating system. Afterwards the Mycron 3 was developed, running CP/M. The Mycron 1000 featured a Zilog Z80 processor and ran MP/M. In 1981, the Mycron 2000 was released, based on an Intel 8086 CPU, running CP/M-86 and MP/M-86 operating systems.

<text>Henry Ireton (baptised 3 November 1611; died 26 November 1651) was an English general in the Parliamentarian army during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and a son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell. He died of disease outside Limerick in November 1651.

==Personal details==
Ireton was the eldest son of German Ireton of Attenborough, Nottinghamshire, and was baptised in St Mary&#x27;s Church on 3 November 1611. He became a gentleman commoner of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1626, graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1629, and entered the Middle Temple the same year.

==English Civil War==
On the outbreak of the First English Civil War he joined the parliamentary army, fighting at the Battle of Edgehill in October 1642 and the Battle of Gainsborough in July 1643. He was made deputy-governor of the Isle of Ely by Oliver Cromwell, and served under the Earl of Manchester in the Yorkshire campaign and at the second Battle of Newbury, afterward supporting Cromwell in his accusations of incompetency against the Earl.

On the night before the Battle of Naseby, in June 1645, Ireton succeeded in surprising the Royalist army and captured many prisoners. The next day, on the suggestion of Cromwell, he was made commissary-general and appointed to the command of the left wing, with Cromwell himself commanding the right. The wing under Ireton was completely broken by the impetuous charge of Prince Rupert, and Ireton was wounded and taken prisoner, but Cromwell charged and successfully routed the Royalists, freeing prisoners including Ireton.

Ireton was at the siege of Bristol in September 1645, and took part in the subsequent campaign that succeeded in overthrowing the royal cause. On 30 October 1645, Ireton entered parliament as member for Appleby. On 15 June 1646, during the siege of Oxford he married Bridget Cromwell, eldest daughter of Oliver Cromwell. The marriage brought Ireton&#x27;s career into parallel with Cromwell&#x27;s.

==Political views and debates over the future of the monarchy==

Ireton was initially a moderate. At the Putney Debates, he opposed extremism, disliked the views of the Republicans and the Levellers, which he considered impractical and dangerous to the foundations of society, and wished to retain a constitutional monarchy of King, Lords, and Commons. He argued for these in the negotiations of the army with Parliament, and in the conferences with the King, Charles I, being the person chiefly entrusted with the drawing up of the army proposals, including the manifesto called &quot;The Heads of the Proposals&quot;, which also proposed a constitutional monarchy. He tried to prevent the breach between the army and parliament, but when it happened, he supported the negotiations with the King until his actions made him unpopular.

Ireton finally became convinced of the hopelessness of dealing with King Charles, and after the King&#x27;s flight to the Isle of Wight, treated his further proposals with coldness and urged the parliament to establish an administration without him. Ireton served under Thomas Fairfax in the Second Civil War in the campaigns in Kent and Essex, although Fairfax, as Lord General, and not Ireton as is sometimes believed, was responsible for the executions of Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle at Colchester. 
After the rejection by the King of the last offers of the army, Ireton zealously supported bringing him to trial. He wrote the Army&#x27;s statement about the regicide—the Remonstrance of the Army—with Hugh Peters. He was active in the choice to purge rather than re-elect Parliament and supported the second Leveller &quot;Agreement of the People&quot;. He sat on the King&#x27;s trial and was one of the commissioners who signed the death warrant.

==Irish campaign and death==

Ireton&#x27;s regiment was chosen by lot to accompany Cromwell in his Irish campaign. Ireton arrived in Dublin two days after Cromwell on 17 August 1649, with 77 ships full of troops and supplies. Ireton was appointed major-general and after the conquest of the south of Ireland, Lord President of Munster. He went over with John Cook with a brief to reform the law of Ireland, to anglicise it, and to make it a model for a new settlement of English law.

In May 1650, Cromwell was recalled to England to command a Parliamentary force preparing to invade Scotland, and Ireton assumed command of the New Model Army in Ireland with the title and powers of Lord Deputy to complete the conquest of the country. This he proceeded to do, becoming noted as much by the savagery of his methods as for his military skill. By the middle of 1650, Ireton and his commanders faced two problems. One was the capture of the remaining cities held by the Irish Confederate and Royalists forces. The other was an escalating guerrilla war in the countryside as Irish fighters called tories attacked his supply lines. Ireton appealed to the English Parliament to publish lenient surrender terms for Irish Catholics, to end their resistance, but this was refused.

His first action after the refusal was to mount a counter-guerrilla expedition into the Wicklow Mountains early in June 1650, to secure his lines of supply for the Siege of Waterford in south-east Ireland. Ireton then blockaded Waterford into surrender by August 1650. Ireton systematically constructed trenches to bring his siege guns within range of the walls and stationed a parliamentary fleet off the city to prevent it being supplied. Thomas Preston surrendered Waterford after a three-month siege. Ireton then advanced to Limerick by October, but had to call off the siege due to cold and bad weather. Early in 1651, Ireton ordered that areas harbouring the guerrillas should be systematically stripped of food – a scorched-earth policy that caused a famine in Ireland by the end of the year. Ireton returned to Limerick in June 1651 and besieged the city for five months until it surrendered in October 1651. At the same time, parliamentarian forces conducted the Siege of Galway, and Ireton rode to inspect the command of Charles Coote, who was blockading that city. The physical strain of his command took hold on Ireton and he fell ill.

After the capture of Limerick, Ireton had dignitaries of Limerick hanged for their defence of the city, including Alderman Thomas Stritch, Bishop Turlough O&#x27;Brien, and an English Royalist officer, Colonel Fennell. He also wanted the Irish commander, Hugh Dubh O&#x27;Neill hanged, but Edmund Ludlow cancelled the order after Ireton&#x27;s death.

Ireton fell ill of the plague that was raging through the town, and died on 26 November. His loss reportedly &quot;struck a great sadness into Cromwell&quot; and he was considered a great loss to the Commonwealth of England. There are various anecdotes about his demise from Irish ecclesiastical and English Royalist sources. Thus, Ireton&#x27;s death has been depicted as divine retribution for the hanging of Bishop O&#x27;Brien, who prior to his death had called upon Ireton to answer at God&#x27;s judgment seat for the New Model Army&#x27;s massacres; the &quot;Hibernica Dominicana&quot; claims that on his death bed, Ireton was &quot;privately muttering to himself, &#x27;I never gave the aid of my counsel towards the murder of that bishop; never, never; it was the council of war did it… I wish I had never seen this popish bishop&#x27;.&quot; Meanwhile, the memoirs of English Cavalier officer Philip Warwick allege that, in his delirious state, Ireton&#x27;s last words were, &quot;Blood! blood! I must have more blood!&quot;

At Ireton&#x27;s funeral, in Westminster Abbey, John Watson and others wore new tabards that replaced the royal arms with the new arms of the Commonwealth.

==Family==
By his wife, Bridget Cromwell, Ireton left one son, Henry Ireton (&quot;circa&quot; 1652–1711), and four daughters, one of whom, Bridget Bendish (she married Thomas Bendish in 1670) is said to have compromised herself in the Rye House Plot of 1683, as did Henry. Ireton&#x27;s widow Bridget afterward married General Charles Fleetwood. Another daughter, Elizabeth, married Thomas Polhill; their son was David Polhill.

==Posthumous execution==
On 30 January 1661, following the Restoration of the English monarchy of 1660, Charles II had Ireton&#x27;s corpse exhumed from Westminster and mutilated in a posthumous execution, along with those of Cromwell and John Bradshaw, in retribution for signing his father&#x27;s death warrant. The date was symbolic, being the 12th anniversary of the execution of Charles I.

==Memorials==
A blue plaque was affixed to Ireton&#x27;s birthplace at Church Lane in Attenborough, on 22 June 2011, by the Beeston and District Local History Society with the following text:
&quot;General Henry Ireton lawyer, confederate and son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell born here 1611 died Limerick 1651&quot;. 
The town of Ireton, Iowa, United States was named after Henry Ireton. 

Ireton Avenue in Beeston near to Attenborough is named after General Ireton. Ireton Road in Market Harborough was also named after Henry Ireton, while Ireton&#x27;s Way is now a very straight part of the A142 between Ely and Chatteris, built by Ireton when he was commanding East Anglian forces as a causeway across the flooded Fens around the River Ouse to rush troops and supplies over when resisting Royalist attack from Lincolnshire and the Midlands.

Ireton Street in Walton, Liverpool sits off County Road (A59) in between (William) Lenthall Street and (John) Hampden Street. 

There is an Ireton Street in Belfast, Northern Ireland, which runs parallel to a Cromwell Road. Also, an Ireton Road is in Colchester. This adjoins Honywood Road, named after Sir Thomas Honywood, who led the Essex forces at the Siege of Colchester under the command of Thomas Fairfax.

An Ireton Avenue exists in Walton-on-Thames as well as &#x27;Ireton&#x27;s House&#x27; on the high street. &#x27;Ireton&#x27;s House&#x27; was gifted to Henry Ireton by Oliver Cromwell after the marriage to Bridget Cromwell.

His portrait continues to hang in the dining hall of Trinity College, Oxford.

==Fictional portrayals==
In the 1970 film &quot;Cromwell&quot;, Michael Jayston plays Ireton as a subtle but well-meaning manipulator who hates Charles I and pushes Cromwell into actions, which Cromwell at first considers neither desirable nor possible, but then pursues all the way. This version of Ireton is ready to denounce the King and plunge England into civil war before Cromwell becomes convinced that this &quot;is&quot; a necessary step. In the film, Cromwell and he are also among the five members whom Charles I attempts to arrest on the eve of the war (when in fact they were not), and after the King is executed, is upbraided by Cromwell as being too ambitious. The film makes no mention of Ireton&#x27;s marriage to Cromwell&#x27;s daughter, Bridget.

Ireton is portrayed as a minor character in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1953 historical fiction novel &quot;Simon&quot;.

Ireton is the main character in John Attenborough&#x27;s 1987 historical fiction novel &quot;Destiny Our Choice&quot;, which gives a generally positive view of Ireton, claiming that he was influential in saving the life of Hugh O&#x27;Neill after the Siege of Limerick in 1650–51.

<doc id="194433" wikidata="Q1646275" url="?curid=194433" title="Tiki 100">
<text>Tiki-100 was a desktop home/personal computer manufactured by Tiki Data of Oslo, Norway. The computer was launched in the spring of 1984 under the original name Kontiki-100, and was first and foremost intended for the emerging educational sector, especially for primary schools. Early prototypes had 4 KB ROM, and the &#x27;100&#x27; in the machine&#x27;s name was based on the total amount of memory in kilobytes.

==Development==
It was decided by the Norwegian government that Norwegian schools should all use the same standardized computer in education. The Tiki-100 was developed as a direct response to this decision, and was as such greatly influenced by the specifications laid out by the government. One of the most influential of these specifications was compatibility with CP/M and the Z80 CPU.

Being designed as a computer intended for education, interactivity was prioritized. The machine was given good audiovisual capabilities for its time. While other educational computers at the time had a main focus on BASIC and simple computer-science, the Tiki-100 had more focus on being a tool to aid in education and everyday-life situations. This put forth the need and memory requirements to run more complex applications.

The first prototype was built using wire-wrap and a bigger prototype case. Soon followed a prototype made on PCB, and there were very little changes from this prototype to the final product. The most significant changes was the change from Siemens keyboard switches to cheaper Sasse switches, along with the re-arranging of the analog video output connection. Very few, if any, revision A or B Tiki-100 computers ever hit the store shelves.

Tiki-100 was released under the original name &#x27;Kontiki-100&#x27; in the spring of 1984. Thor Heyerdahl threatened to open a legal case on the use of the Kontiki name, with reference to the name of his famous raft. The name was changed to &quot;Tiki-100&quot; as a result. Around the same time, &quot;Computerworld&quot; magazine claimed the operating system &quot;KP/M&quot; was a direct copy of CP/M, due to KP/M being able to run CP/M software. As a response to these claims, KP/M was renamed &quot;Tiko&quot; to avoid direct association to CP/M and Digital Research.

==Specifications==
Specifications for the basic Tiki-100 model:
*CPU: Zilog Z80 running at 4 MHz.
*Memory: 64 KB of RAM (main memory), 32 KB of graphical memory and 8 KB of ROM. 
*Keyboard: An N-key rollover mechanical keyboard integrated into the computer case
*Graphics: PAL-compatible, based on discrete TTL components. Bitmap graphics with a 256-color palette, supporting 3 different resolutions with 256x256x16 colours, 512x256x4 colours or 1024x256x2 simultaneous colours. The Tiki-100 has no text-mode as it used bitmapped graphics only. However, terminal emulators provided options of 40, 80 or 160 by 25 characters, each option using one of the three modes. All of the graphics modes have hardware vertical scroll.
*Audio: An AY-3-8912 polyphonic sound generator
*Storage: One or two integrated 5¼ inch floppy disk drives
*Interfaces: Two RS-232 serial ports, One Centronics printer port

Software included:
*TIKO, a CP/M 2.2-compatible operating system
*A version of the BBC BASIC programming language interpreter
*A COMAL interpreter

Optional expansions:
* A harddisk controller, replacing one of the floppy disk stations with a 8MB harddisk.
* A bespoke network-hub that allowed up to 16 computers to connect in a network, sharing disks and printers. The server was a Tiki-100 with harddisk, running the MP/M operating system, serving up to 3 different printers simultaneously.

=== 8/16 upgrade ===
An 8/16 upgrade was possible, consisting of a secondary CPU card with a 4 MHz 8088 processor. With this upgrade the machine is capable of running MS-DOS 2.11, with RAM being expanded up to 736 KB, while retaining full compatibility with the Z80 based TIKOS. Although running MS-DOS, the expansion does not provide PC-compatibility. When programs are running on the 8088, the Z80 CPU is serving as an I/O processor, handling disk I/O, graphics etc.

=== Rev. D ===
Later, an Intel 8088 based IBM PC compatible model running MS-DOS was made, somewhat confusingly called Tiki-100 Rev. D. In addition to being PC-compatible (including CGA-compatible graphics), it also contained a Z80 processor so that it could run the original &quot;Tiki 100&quot; software, although with a slightly reduced graphics specification due to the CGA. The two processors shared the same bus, and the Z80 programs still ran under the 8088 operating system.

== Tiki-200 ==
After the commercial failure of the Tiki-100 rev. D, it was succeeded by the Tiki-200. This was a standard IBM PC-clone, with imported hardware which did not make any attempt at maintaining backward-compatibility with the Tiki-100. Despite these attempts at adapting to the personal-computer market, due to steep competition Tiki-Data was unable to maintain a stable foothold in it and went into gradual decline. In 1996 the company along with its deficit was bought by Merkantildata.

<doc id="194436" wikidata="Q1379849" url="?curid=194436" title="Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland">
<text>The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland (; ) is a national church of Finland. It is part of the Lutheran branch of Christianity. The church has a legal position as a national church in the country, along with the Orthodox Church of Finland.
The church is a member of the World Council of Churches and the Conference of European Churches. It is also a member of the Porvoo Communion and is actively involved in ecumenical relations.

With 3.6 million members , the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is one of the largest Lutheran churches in the world. It is Finland&#x27;s largest religious body; at the end of 2022, 65.2% of Finns were members of the church. The current head of the Church is Tapio Luoma, Archbishop of Turku, who succeeded Kari Mäkinen on 3 June 2018.

== History ==

=== Catholic bishopric ===
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland traces its lineage to the medieval Diocese of Turku, which coincides geographically with present-day Finland. Christianity was introduced to Finland slowly: the first signs of the Christian faith being found in burial sites dated to the 9th century.

Based on etymological evidence, it seems that its very first influences came to present-day Finland from the Eastern Christian tradition. Archaeological evidence shows that by the middle 12th century, Christianity was dominant in the region around present-day Turku. One legend recounts a crusade dated around 1054, but no contemporary or archaeological evidence backs the story. Another legend is that the martyr-bishop St. Henry founded the Finnish Church, but that is also most likely fictional.

The introduction of Christianity was mostly a peaceful, slow process contemporaneous with the gradual integration with Sweden, although a series of Swedish-led crusades were fought during this era.

The first bishop, whose name was Thomas, lived in the first half of the 13th century. Thomas was granted resignation by Pope Innocent IV on 21 February 1245. According to the pope, Thomas had admitted committing several felonies, such as torturing a man to death, and forging a papal letter.

The ecclesiastical hierarchy was completely established during the Second Swedish Crusade.

During the Middle Ages, the Diocese of Turku was under the primacy of the Archbishop of Uppsala, mirroring the country&#x27;s Swedish political rule. The diocese had a school, making it capable of educating its own priests, but several Finns also studied abroad in the universities of Germany and Paris.

Before the Reformation, the most important monastic orders active in the bishopric were those of the Franciscans, the Dominicans, and the Bridgettines. The liturgy of the diocese followed the Dominican model.

=== Part of the Church of Sweden ===

The Swedish Reformation began during the reign of King Gustav Vasa (1527) and reached its conclusion in 1560. Sweden, like other Nordic countries, adopted the Lutheran form of Protestantism. Most monastic estates in Finland, along with Kuusisto Castle, which was the medieval residence of the Bishops of Turku, were confiscated by the Swedish crown.

The first Lutheran Bishop of Turku was Martinus Johannis Skytte, former Vicar General of the Dominican Province of Dacia. He retained most of the old Catholic forms within the Diocese, which was part of the now-independent Church of Sweden. The doctrinal reformation of the Finnish Church took place during the episcopacy of Mikael Agricola, who had studied at the University of Wittenberg under Martin Luther.

Agricola translated the whole New Testament and large portions of the Old Testament into Finnish. In addition, he authored a large amount of Finnish liturgical texts in the spirit of The Reformation, while preserving a number of decidedly Catholic customs such as the retention of many holy days including the Visitation of Mary and Holy Cross Day, and the use of the bishop&#x27;s mitre. While images and sculptures of saints were retained in the churches, they were no longer venerated. Agricola was the first Bishop of Turku who was married.
By the end of the 16th century, the Swedish Reformation was finally complete, and the following century was known as the period of Lutheran orthodoxy. Membership in the church was obligatory, as was attendance at Divine Service.

In newly conquered Finnish Karelia, the Lutheran Church suppressed the Eastern Orthodoxy of the local population, which drove a large number to Russia.

At this time, the Church started to lay the foundations for comprehensive education, in which every person was required to know the basic tenets of the Christian faith. Parish vergers were given the duty of instructing children in reading and in the Catechism. The education of priests was improved, the Royal Academy of Turku was founded, and the educational system was codified in the Church Act of 1686.

In the early 18th century, Finland was occupied by Russia for a decade during the Great Northern War. A large portion of Finland was annexed by Russia, where the Lutheran church remained active despite being under Russian rule. The two branches of Finnish Lutheranism that were thereby divided were reunited in the early 19th century.

In both Russia and Sweden, Lutheranism was greatly affected by the theology of Enlightenment, which had the effect of secularizing the Church. This, and the lavish lifestyle of parish vicars, caused public resentment which became visible in popular local revival movements.

=== An independent state church ===

The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is a successor to the Church of Sweden of which it was a part until 1809, when the Grand Duchy of Finland was established as a part of the Russian Empire, and consequently shared established status with the Finnish Orthodox Church.

In 1869, a new Church Act was passed by the Finnish &quot;Lantdag&quot;. The Act separated church and the state, giving the church its own legislative body, known as the central Synod.

Changes in ecclesiastical form could be made only by the central Synod, which had the sole right to propose changes to the Church Act. These changes could subsequently either be passed or vetoed by the &quot;Lantdag&quot; and the Russian Emperor. A year earlier, Lutheran parishes had been differentiated from the secular municipalities, with both being given their own finances and administrative bodies.

The Church&#x27;s general responsibility for comprehensive education and for the care of the poor was transferred to the secular municipalities. The Church accepted separation from the state, because the head of state was the Orthodox Russian Emperor, it regarded complete integration with the state as problematic.

In 1889, an act was passed allowing other Christian denominations to act freely in the country, and members of the Lutheran Church were given the right to leave the church to join other Christian communities. Since 1923, it has been possible to leave the state church without having to join another religious congregation.

During the early 19th century, several revivalist movements were formed, four of which were particularly prominent. These movements were:
* (those who kneel to pray, or pray frequently), founded by peasant girl Liisa Erkintytär, and later, by the priest Abraham Achrenius. The movement has been active mostly in Western Finland.
* &quot;The Awakening&quot; (also called Pietists), founded by the peasant Paavo Ruotsalainen.
* (connected to Neo-Lutheranism), founded by the priest Fredrik Gabriel Hedberg.
* Laestadianism, founded by Lars Levi Laestadius.

The revivalists met strong opposition from the bishops and the educated part of the population but drew large followings in the countryside. In modern Finnish historiography, the revivalist movements have been considered to be a part of the social upheaval caused by the modernization of society.

In the late 19th century, the Church started to face opposition from liberalism, the position of the Church being particularly questioned by the emerging labor movement. The Church was also challenged by the Baptist faith and the Methodist faith, which became the first two private religious communities in Finland.

The Church reacted by allowing its own revivalist movements more freedom and by starting new youth activities such as Sunday schools and Christian youth associations, but the main current of Finnish nationalism was affected by Lutheranism. For example, the most important philosopher of Finnish nationalism, Johan Vilhelm Snellman, considered Lutheranism an important factor of the Finnish identity, although he was critical of the Church as an organization.

=== Disestablished national church ===
In the early 20th century, the old &quot;Landtag&quot;, based on the four estates of the realm, was changed into a unicameral parliament (Eduskunta) selected by equal vote.

In 1908, an amendment of the Church Act freed church members from the legal duty to participate in Holy Communion at least once a year. After this, church attendance dropped and has since become an indicator of personal religious opinion. (See also &quot;kyrkogångsplikt&quot;, the previous requirement to attend church services.)

Finnish independence, in 1917, was immediately followed by the Finnish Civil War, with the church associating itself with the White (nationalist) side, while the Red Guards embraced anticlericalism to the point of murdering priests.

In the Constitution of 1919, the new republic was deemed to be non-confessional and freedom of worship was enshrined as a right.

In 1923, this right was further implemented through the Freedom of Religion Act. Although the act gave the right for every adult Finn to leave the Church (and consequently be free from the duty of paying Church tax), the vast majority of the people remained members, regardless of their political leanings.
During the Second World War, the church was an important factor in Finnish nationalism. The common nationalist cry during the war was &quot;For the home, the religion and the Fatherland&quot; (, ). In addition, during the war, the church participated actively in social work, thereby coming closer to the labour movement.

Military chaplains, who shared the life of the common soldiers for several years, also grew closer to the life of the working class. At the war&#x27;s end, these so-called &quot;brother-in-arms priests&quot; () continued their work among factory workers. Elsewhere in society, liturgical, family, and youth works emerged as new forms of church activity, and the position of laity within the Church was strengthened. The so-called fifth revivalist movement also began as a result of revivals experienced during the war. Martti Simojoki and Mikko Juva were two former military chaplains who became Finnish archbishops, their time in the office covering two decades.

In the 1960s, the church faced strong opposition from the radical left, who considered it an old-fashioned fortress of reaction and criticized the rudiments of the church&#x27;s position within the state.

The 1966 blasphemy trial of novelist Hannu Salama became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for the antiestablishmentarian position. Salama was sentenced to three months in prison but placed on probation, before subsequently being pardoned by President Urho Kekkonen.

Another widely criticized aspect of the Finnish Church-State relationship was the prohibition of public dances and movie theaters on Saturdays preceding certain Sundays, a ban that remained in effect until 1968.

The Church responded to its unpopular situation by a program of modernization.

During the 1970s, work on new Finnish Bible translations and a new hymnal was begun. The hymnal, which incorporated a large number of revivalist and youth hymns, was adopted in 1986. In addition, a new Bible translation (based on the theory of dynamical equivalence) was completed and approved for use in 1992. Finally, the Synod opened the priesthood to women, a change that was first discussed, but not passed, by the Synod in 1963, and which continues to cause controversy. In response, traditionalist clergy and laity from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, established, in 2003, the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland, a nonterritorial ecclesiastical province that only ordains men to holy orders and does not perform same-sex marriages. The Evangelical Lutheran Mission Diocese of Finland is a member of the International Lutheran Council, which represents Confessional Lutheran bodies around the globe.

== Position in Finnish society ==
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland has a legal position as a national church in the country alongside the Finnish Orthodox Church. The Constitution of Finland provides for a Church Act (&quot;kirkkolaki&quot;) to organize and govern the Evangelical Lutheran Church; the Act can only be amended with the initiative of the Synod of the Church – maintaining their autonomy since Tsarist times.

Finnish society has experienced a general secularization, and membership in the church has decreased in recent decades. In 2015, Eroakirkosta.fi, a website which offers an electronic service for resigning from Finland&#x27;s state churches, reported that half a million church members had resigned from the church since the website was opened in 2003. Nevertheless, the church retains the allegiance of a large majority of the population, a special role in state ceremonies, and the right to collect the church tax from its members in conjunction with governmental income taxation. In addition to the membership tax, businesses also participate to some extent by a tax that is distributed to the church.

Avoidance of the church tax (between 1 and 2 percent depending on location) has been a popular reason cited for defections from the Church. In 2010, the number of defections hit a record of 83,097, caused in part by the church&#x27;s position that homosexuality is a sin. That position was made clear on a Finnish television discussion program concerning gay rights that was broadcast on 12 October 2010, in which church clergy and laymen were divided both for and against proposed legal amendments to increase LGBT rights.

Stefan Wallin, Finland&#x27;s minister responsible for church affairs, accused Päivi Räsänen, the leader of the Christian Democrats, of deliberately taking a public position against homosexuality and gay rights in order to drive away from the church those people who might hold more liberal views on gay acceptance.

On 9 February 2011, the ELCF Bishops&#x27; Conference issued a &quot;Pastoral instruction concerning free prayer with and for those who have registered their civil partnership&quot;, which can be conducted either privately or publicly in a church, with or without guests, but which is not to be confused with &quot;the blessing of a partnership comparable to marriage&quot;.

As of 2022, just 65.2% of Finns belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, a decline of 13.0 percentage points from 2010. The highest share of the population belonging to the church is in South Ostrobothnia, where 81.9% belong to the church. Meanwhile, the lowest share is in Uusimaa, where the proportion is 53.8%. On a municipal level, there are only three municipalities where over 90% belong to the church; Perho, Kinnula and Reisjärvi. Helsinki (47.6%) and Vantaa (49.1%) are municipalities where a minority of the population belong to the church.

== Teachings ==
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland sees itself as part of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. It is Lutheran in doctrine, following the teachings of Martin Luther. The church is a member of the Lutheran World Federation and the Porvoo Communion, but has not signed the Leuenberg Agreement.

The faith of the Church is pronounced in the three confessions of the old church (Apostles&#x27; Creed, Nicene Creed and Athanasian Creed) and the Lutheran confessional documents as defined in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot;.

The practical faith is described in the catechism of the church, which is based on and literally includes the Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism. The latest version of the catechism was accepted by the General Synod in 1999.

The Church accepts the doctrines of the virgin birth and bodily resurrection.

The church does not embrace creationism but states:
Among contemporary doctrines, the church takes a moderate position.

The Church allows its members to work as military personnel or as judges, considering these duties important to the welfare of society.

The relation of the church to sexuality is somewhat ambiguous, strictly condemning extramarital sex but in relation to premarital sex stating:

Divorce and subsequent remarriage is accepted, with reservations. Abortion is accepted, because the church deems that the woman has the right to decide to terminate the pregnancy but the woman is not allowed to make the decision alone. Abortion should be limited to serious cases where the birth would cause serious danger or suffering either to the family or the child. Such cases should be defined in legislation, which is the case in Finland. However, the woman pondering abortion should get all possible support before and after the decision, regardless of its outcome.

On LGBT issues, the Church has been engaged in dialogue. The church has no official policy on the ordination of gay clergy, and, since 2002, &quot;one bishop has declared his willingness to ordain homosexuals.&quot; The synod of bishops has stated that sexual minorities should not be shunned or persecuted, but that they are, as all people, responsible for the applications of their sexuality. In 2010, the church took a more open position and voted to allow prayer services to be given following a civil same-sex union. The purpose of such prayer services, according to the Finnish Lutheran synod and archbishop, is to take a &quot;clear and unequivocal stance in support of gay and lesbian couples&quot;. According to church policy on same-sex civil partnerships, &quot;the couple may organise prayers with a priest or other church workers and invited guests. This may take place on church premises.&quot;
In 2012, the Diocese of Kuopio appointed an openly transgender pastor to an office in the church.

After same-sex marriage became legal in 2014, Archbishop Kari Mäkinen announced his support for gay marriage. In 2016, the Synod did not authorize a rite for same-sex marriage, but did, as before, allow pastors &quot;to pray with and for all couples who have entered into a civil [same-sex] marriage&quot;. Therefore, while the bishops did not agree to performing same-sex marriages, &quot;the bishops have taken the position that it is possible to hold prayer services to bless same-sex couples.&quot; As with civil partnerships, the church teaches that &quot;same-sex couples can have a prayer ceremony&quot; in the church. The bishops&#x27; announcement also said that &quot;[this] change to marriage laws means that members of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church, persons in high office and workers stand with same-sex [persons] in marriage.&quot; Some clergy announced their intent to marry same-gender couples arguing that &quot;public servant&#x27;s rights grant [them] the possibility of marrying same-sex couples&quot;. Nevertheless, the Diocese of Helsinki disciplined a pastor for performing a same-sex marriage. In March 2024, the Bishops endorsed a proposal to allow clergy to perform same-sex marriages; the proposal will need to be approved by the General Synod. A spokesperson for the Bishops noted that in practice, some clergy have already been performing same-sex marriages; some dioceses have admonished clergy for doing so but others have not.

The apostolic succession of the Church is considered to have remained intact through the proper ordination of bishop Mikael Agricola, but it was broken in 1884 when all the Finnish Lutheran bishops died within a year. The succession remained valid in the Church of Sweden from where it was returned in the 1930s by the ordination of the bishop of Tampere. However, the concept of apostolic succession is important foremost in ecumenical contexts, particularly in dealings with the Anglican Communion. In the theology of the Church itself, the valid signs of the Church include only the &quot;pure preaching of the gospel and the performance of the sacraments according to the decree of Christ&quot;.

The central point of the Church doctrine, does not, however, lie in the areas of sexuality and creation but in the doctrine of justification. The human being is always a sinner, completely unable to reach God by his own merit. However, Christians are atoned by the grace of God, through the sacrifice of Christ, completely undeservedly. The Christian is simultaneously a sinner and a righteous person. At the end of time, Christ will return and subject all to his judgment. Then everlasting perdition can only be avoided by Christ&#x27;s mercy.

The saving grace becomes visible in the two sacraments, the Holy Communion and Baptism. Baptism is administered even to children, as it is effective regardless of personal attitudes, &quot;for Baptism and faith are God&#x27;s work in us.&quot; Any Christian may perform a valid baptism, but in normal cases, the priest should perform the sacrament. An emergency baptism performed by a member of the Church must immediately be reported to the parish in which the baptism took place.

In the Holy Communion, or the Sacrament of the Altar, Christ gives his own real body and blood for people to eat and to drink. The Church practises closed Communion but does not put any limitations on its members for partaking the Holy Communion. The only prerequisite needed is faith, however fragile.

Children may take part in Communion after their parents have instructed them to understand the meaning of Communion. If a person is in mortal danger and wishes to receive Holy Communion, any Christian is allowed to administer him a valid sacrament. Normally, nonetheless, the administering of the sacrament is reserved to priests. The ordination of women is allowed.

Publicly, the church strongly supports the existing Finnish social welfare model, which it sees threatened especially by neoliberalism and globalization. This has led to the church being criticized from the political right for being the religious arm of social democracy. The church has answered that it takes no political sides but strives to work for the weakest in the society.

The Church does not control its members strictly. Rituals such as weddings and funerals are often considered to be the most important reasons to remain a member.

== Organisation ==

The structure of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is mainly based on geographical division. Every member belongs to the parish of their domicile, with parish boundaries following municipal boundaries. Large cities, on the other hand, are usually divided into several parishes, with the geographical location of the members&#x27; homes determining parish membership. The membership of a parish varies from a few hundred in small municipalities to around 60,000 members in the parish of Malmi, Helsinki. According to the Church Act, the parish is responsible for all the practical work performed by the church. The parish is headed by the vicar and the parish council. Both are elected by the members, using equal, closed voting. The term of the parish council is four years while the vicar is elected for life or until he reaches sixty-eight years of age. A parish is a legal person of public nature, capable of taxing its members. The amount of tax collected is decided by the parish council and falls between 1 and 2.25 percent of personal income. In practice, the tax is collected by the state, for a fee.

Financially, the parishes are responsible for themselves. However, poor parishes can be assisted by the central administration. On the other hand, all parishes are responsible for contributing 10 percent of their income to the central administration of the church and the dioceses. The day-to-day affairs of the parish administration are taken care of by the vicar and the parish board, elected by the parish council. In cities, the parishes of the city have a common parish council but separate parish boards.

=== Pastoral formation ===
A master&#x27;s degree in Theology is compulsory before ordination. The Church also has its own vocational postgraduate educational system. A newly ordained pastor is eligible for the position of &quot;Parish Pastor&quot; (, ), formerly &quot;Assistant Priest&quot; (, ). In order to be eligible for the position of &quot;Chaplain&quot; (, ) or &quot;Vicar&quot; (, ), the &quot;Pastoral Degree of the Church&quot; (, ) is required. Before being able to apply for the post of Vicar, a degree in leadership skills (, ) is also compulsory. The Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Prayer Brotherhood is an optional clergy confraternity.

In order to be eligible for the position of a &quot;Vicar General&quot; (, ) or &quot;Diocesan Dean&quot; (, ) the &quot;Higher Pastoral Degree of the Church&quot; (, ) is required.

In addition to religious worship, local Lutheran communities arrange many non-religious activities as well. In Finland, as in other Nordic countries, most people go to church only occasionally, such as for Christmas and weddings.

=== Dioceses and bishops ===
The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland is divided into nine dioceses. Each diocese is headed by a bishop and a cathedral chapter. The Archdiocese of Turku is headed by the archbishop, who is personally responsible for leading two deaneries within that diocese. He is assisted by a bishop of Turku who takes day-to-day responsibility for running the rest of the diocese, leaving the archbishop free for his duties of national leadership and international representation. The bishops meet together regularly in the Bishops&#x27; Conference, which has eleven members; these are the archbishop, his assistant bishop of Turku, the other eight diocesan bishops, and the Chaplain General of the Defence Forces, whose title is (&#x27;field bishop&#x27;), although he is not necessarily in bishop&#x27;s Orders.

Eight dioceses are regional, with the remaining one covering all of the country&#x27;s Swedish-language parishes. The Church&#x27;s supreme decision-making body is the Synod, which meets twice a year. Laity comprise a majority of the Synod, but a fixed number of seats are reserved for the clergy. The Synod proposes changes in the Ecclesiastical Act and decides on the Ecclesiastical Order. The Synod deals with questions of doctrine and approves the books of the church. The Synod directs the Church&#x27;s common activities, administration, and finances. Congregational elections are held every four years to determine administrative posts at the local level.

<text>The Siberian stonechat or Asian stonechat (Saxicola maurus) is a recently validated species of the Old World flycatcher family (Muscicapidae). Like the other thrush-like flycatchers, it was often placed in the Turdidae in the past. It breeds in the East Palearctic including in easternmost Europe and winters in the Old World tropics.

==Description, systematics and taxonomy==

It resembles its closest living relative the European stonechat (&quot;S. rubicola&quot;), but is typically darker above and paler below, with a white rump and whiter underparts with less orange on the breast. The male in breeding plumage has black upperparts and head (lacking the brownish tones of the European stonechat), a conspicuous white collar, scapular patch and rump, and a restricted area of orange on the throat.

The female has pale brown upperparts and head, white neck patches (not a full collar), and a pale, unstreaked pinkish-yellow rump. Males in winter plumage are intermediate between summer males and females, with a supercilium resembling the whinchat (&quot;S. rubetra&quot;); from this species and the female it can be distinguished by the full white collar.

If seen at close distance, it can be recognized that its primary remiges are distinctly longer than in &quot;S. rubicola&quot;. In this, it closely resembles the whinchat, which like &quot;S. maurus&quot; is adapted to long-distance migrations.

The male has a clicking call, like two pebbles knocked together. The song is high and twittering like the dunnock (&quot;Prunella modularis&quot;), an unrelated passeridan songbird belonging to the Passeroidea.

There are five or six subspecies, with &quot;S. m. maurus&quot; (described above) and the distinct but similar &quot;S. m. stejnegeri&quot; found across northern and central Asia. The southern &quot;S. m. variegatus&quot; (west of the Caspian Sea), &quot;S. m. armenicus&quot; (eastern Turkey to Iran), &quot;S. m. indicus&quot; (Himalaya) and the Turkestan stonechat &quot;S. m. przewalskii&quot; (southwest China) are distinguished by larger white areas on the plumage.

In the past, &quot;S. maurus&quot; was usually included in &quot;S. torquatus&quot; as part of the &quot;common stonechat&quot;, but that scientific name nowadays is restricted to the African stonechat. Analysis of mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence and nDNA microsatellite fingerprinting data, though not unequivocal, together with the evidence from morphology, behaviour and biogeography seems to indicate that the present bird can be considered a distinct species. The European stonechat is its western sister species in the Eurasian lineage of stonechats; their ancestors separated during the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene, roughly 1.5-2.5 million years ago at the onset of the Quaternary glaciation.

Its scientific name means &quot;dark rock-dweller&quot;. &quot;Saxicola&quot; derives from Latin &quot;saxum&quot; &quot;rock&quot; + &quot;incola&quot; &quot;inhabitant&quot;; &quot;maurus&quot; is Latinized from Greek &quot;maúros&quot; (μαύρος) &quot;black&quot; (cf. &quot;moor&quot;), in reference to the upperpart colour as compared to &quot;S. rubicola&quot;.

==Distribution and ecology==
The breeding range covers most of temperate Asia, from about latitude 71°N in Siberia south to the Himalaya and southwest China, and west to eastern Turkey and the Caspian Sea area. It also breeds in the far northeast of Europe, mainly in Russia but occasionally as far west as Finland.

The wintering range of the migratory bird is from southern Japan south to Thailand and India, and west to northeast Africa. On migration, small numbers reach as far west as western Europe, and exceptionally as far east as Alaska in North America.

The Siberian stonechat is insectivorous. It breeds in open rough scrubland or rough grassland with scattered shrubs, from sea level to about 4,000 m ASL or more. The birds seem to avoid even cool temperate conditions and stay up north only during the hot continental summer. In the montane regions of the Himalaya foothills of Bhutan, migrants can on occasion be seen foraging in fields and pastures more than 2,000 m ASL, but most move further down and south to winter in tropical regions.

Though it is not considered a distinct species by the IUCN, it is widespread and common and would not be considered a threatened species.

<text>Sir Charles Lucas, 1613 to 28 August 1648, was a professional soldier from Essex, who served as a Royalist cavalry leader during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Taken prisoner at the end of the First English Civil War in March 1646, he was released after swearing not to fight against Parliament again, an oath he broke when the Second English Civil War began in 1648. As a result, he was executed following his capture at the Siege of Colchester in August 1648, and became a Royalist martyr after the 1660 Stuart Restoration.

Royalist statesman and historian Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, described Lucas as &quot;rough, proud, uncultivated and morose&quot;, but &quot;a gallant man to look upon and follow&quot;. A brave and capable cavalry commander with a reputation for bad temper and ruthlessness, he is chiefly remembered for the manner of his death. 

==Personal details==
Charles Lucas was born in Colchester, Essex in 1613, youngest son of Sir Thomas Lucas (1573–1625) and his wife Elizabeth (died 1647). One of eight children, the eldest brother Thomas (1598–1649) was technically illegitimate, and so the second brother John (1606–1671) inherited the family estates. Lucas also had five sisters, Mary (1608–1646), wife of Sir Peter Killigrew (1593–1668), Anne (1614–?), Elizabeth (1612–1691), who married Sir William Walter (1604–1675), and Catherine (1605–1702), wife of Sir Edmund Pye (1607–1673). His youngest sister Margaret (1623–1673), was a prolific author and scientist who in 1645 married William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (1593–1676), Royalist commander in Northern England from 1642 to 1644.

==Career==
As a young man, Lucas served under his brother John in the Eighty Years War, and during the 1639 to 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars commanded a troop of cavalry in the army of Charles I, being knighted in 1639. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, Lucas joined the Royalist army, and was wounded at the Battle of Powick Bridge, the first major engagement of the conflict. 

Early in 1643, Lucas raised a regiment of horse, with which he defeated Middleton at Padbury on 1 July. In January 1644, he commanded the forces attacking Nottingham, and soon afterwards, on the recommendation of Prince Rupert, he was made lieutenant-general of the Duke of Newcastle&#x27;s Northern army. When Newcastle was shut up in York, Lucas and the cavalry remained in the open country, and when Rupert&#x27;s relieving army crossed the hills into Yorkshire he was quickly joined by Newcastle&#x27;s squadrons. 

At Marston Moor in July 1644, Lucas swept Sir Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s horse from the field, but the battle was a decisive Parliamentarian victory and he was captured during the fighting. Exchanged for Parliamentary prisoners during the winter, in December 1645 he defended Berkeley Castle against forces led by Thomas Rainsborough. The garrison surrendered after being granted free passage to the nearest Royalist territory, and Lucas became lieutenant-general of the remnants of the Royalist cavalry. In March 1646, he was captured once again at Stow-on-the-Wold, the last major battle of the First Civil War.

Lucas was released after promising not to bear arms against Parliament again, and in March 1648 compounded for the return of his estates after swearing an oath of loyalty. When the Second English Civil War began in May 1648, he ignored both agreements and took a prominent part in the seizure of Colchester; following a three-month siege, the town surrendered on 28 August 1648.

==Execution &amp; burial==
On 20 June 1648, Parliament had declared all those who took part in the Second Civil War were guilty of high treason. When Colchester capitulated, the Royalist commanders, including Lucas, Lord Norwich, Sir Arthur Capel, Henry Hastings, Sir George Lisle and Bernard Gascoigne were obliged to &quot;render themselves to mercy&quot;, while the rest of the garrison were given &quot;quarter&quot;. These terms had specific and well-known military meanings; prisoners granted &quot;quarter&quot; were guaranteed their lives, &quot;mercy&quot; left it to the discretion of the victorious commander. The ferocity of the siege meant many senior officers of the New Model Army were in no mood to pardon those they considered responsible for a second and unnecessary round of bloodshed. This was especially true of Royalists like Lucas who had already been pardoned once before. 

As members of the nobility, Norwich, Hastings and Capel were sent to the Tower of London for trial; Capel was executed in March 1649, while Norwich and Hastings were exiled. Lucas, Lisle and Gascoigne were condemned to death by a court martial, a sentence Henry Ireton justified by reference to the ruling by Parliament in June. Although Lucas knew he had broken the terms of his parole and did not expect mercy a second time, he argued that he had acted as &quot;a true subject to my king and the laws of the kingdom&quot; and &quot;fought with a commission from those that were my sovereigns, and from that commission I must justify my action&quot;. His fate was sealed when two soldiers who had previously served in the Parliamentarian garrison of Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire gave evidence that after their surrender in 1645, Lucas had ordered the execution of over 20 men. 

Since Gascoigne, or Bernardo Guasconi, was from Florence, he was reprieved by Parliament, which was wary of antagonising a foreign power, but Lucas and Lisle were executed by firing squad on 28 August 1648 in the castle yard at Colchester, and interred in the Lucas family vault within St Giles&#x27;s Church. Twelve years later, on 7 June 1661, the two men were reburied in an elaborate ceremony, and a stone placed by John Lucas, 1st Baron Lucas on their tombs. The inscription stated they were &quot;by the command of Sir Thomas Fairfax in cold blood barbarously murdered&quot;, although in reality Fairfax had acted legally and in accordance with the terms of the capitulation.

==Contemporary reputation==
Lucas was reputed to be one of the best cavalry leaders in the king&#x27;s army. Even Clarendon, who claimed he was &quot;rough, proud, uncultivated, morose&quot; and intolerable off the battlefield, also described him as &quot;very brave in his person, and in a day of battle a gallant man to look upon and follow&quot;. According to his sister, Lucas &quot;naturally had a practical genius to the warlike arts, as natural poets have to poetry, but his life was cut off before he could arrive at the true perfection thereof&quot;. He left a &quot;Treatise of the Arts of War&quot;, but being written in cipher it was never published. To his military gifts Lucas added a devotion to the king&#x27;s cause, which he sometimes expressed in singularly high-flown and poetical language.

<doc id="194444" wikidata="Q1101373" url="?curid=194444" title="William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle">
<text>William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne, KG, KB, PC (25 December 1676), who after 1665 styled himself as Prince William Cavendish, was an English courtier and supporter of the arts. He was a renowned horse breeder, as well as being patron of the playwright Ben Jonson and the intellectual group known as the Welbeck Circle.

Despite spending the then enormous sum of £15,000 entertaining Charles I in 1634, he failed to gain a significant political post. In the early stages of the First English Civil War, he was appointed Royalist Captain-General in Northern England; he financed much of the war effort himself, later claiming this totalled in excess of £1,000,000. After the defeat at Marston Moor in July 1644, a battle fought against his advice, he went into exile in Europe.

He returned to England after the Stuart Restoration in 1660, and although created Duke of Newcastle in 1665, he remained on the fringes of the court and became critical of Charles II. He died in 1676 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Personal details==
William Cavendish was born at Handsworth, South Yorkshire, the eldest surviving son of Sir Charles Cavendish and Catherine Ogle, descended from the Barons Ogle. He was a grandson of Bess of Hardwick and courtier William Cavendish. He had a younger brother, Charles (1594–1654), and the two remained close friends throughout their lives.

In 1618, Cavendish married Elizabeth Howard (1599–1643), with whom he had five children – Jane (1621–1669), Charles (1626–1659), Elizabeth (1626–1663), Henry, 2nd Duke of Newcastle (1630–1691), and Frances. Encouraged by their father, Jane and Elizabeth became minor poets and writers. In 1645, he married Margaret Lucas, a natural philosopher and writer. With his help and support, she became a popular writer of plays, poetry, and fiction, and was known as &quot;mad Madge&quot; for her extravagant style and affected manner.

==Career==
Created a Knight of the Bath in 1610, he was elected Member of Parliament for East Retford in the 1614 &quot;Addled Parliament&quot; and succeeded his father in 1617. Cavendish was created &#x27;Viscount Mansfield&#x27; in 1620 and &#x27;Earl of Newcastle-upon-Tyne&#x27; in 1628 but failed to achieve high office, despite spending the enormous sum of £15,000 entertaining Charles I in 1634. However, in 1638 he was appointed governor of the Prince of Wales, then made a Privy Counsellor. When the Bishops&#x27; Wars began in 1639, he provided the king with a loan of £10,000 and a troop of volunteer horse. He was appointed Gentleman of the Robes in 1641, but was implicated in the Army Plot, and withdrew for a time from the court.
As tension increased, both Charles and Parliament tried to secure key ports and weapons; an attempt by Newcastle to capture Hull in July failed. When Charles formally declared war in August, Newcastle was given command of the four northern counties, largely because he was willing to pay for his own troops. In November 1642, he advanced into Yorkshire, raised the siege of York, and forced Lord Fairfax to retire after attacking him at Tadcaster.

Fighting continued during the winter, as Newcastle tried to secure a landing place for an arms convoy organised by Henrietta Maria, who was in the Dutch Republic purchasing weapons. He had insufficient troops to hold the entire area, and Parliamentary forces under Lord Fairfax and his son Sir Thomas, retained key towns like Hull, and Leeds. In late February 1643, a convoy with Henrietta Maria and weapons landed at Bridlington, and was escorted to Oxford. This success, combined with a victory at Adwalton Moor near Leeds in June, caused Newcastle to be created &#x27;Marquess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne&#x27;.

The 1643 Solemn League and Covenant had created a Committee of Both Kingdoms, which for the first time co-ordinated Parliamentary strategy in all three war zones, England, Scotland and Ireland. In February 1644, the Scots under Leven besieged Newcastle, closing the major import point for Royalist war supplies. They made little progress, with the Marquess-based nearby at Durham.

Two weeks later, the Earl of Manchester defeated a Royalist force at Selby. Newcastle had to leave Durham, and garrison York, which city was besieged by the Scots, Sir Thomas Fairfax, and Manchester&#x27;s Army of the Eastern Association. In May, Prince Rupert left Shrewsbury and marched north; on 29 June he arrived at Knaresborough, 30 kilometres from York, to find he was faced by a superior force. Despite Newcastle&#x27;s opposition, the largest battle of the war took place on 2 July at Marston Moor. The result was a decisive Royalist defeat that lost them the North, while York surrendered on 16 July. 

As a military commander, Lord Clarendon described Newcastle as &quot;fit to be a general as a bishop&quot;. However, Marston Moor was fought against his advice, while he was also intelligent enough to understand his limits, and recruited reliable subordinates. After Marston Moor, Newcastle left England for Hamburg, accompanied by his two sons and his brother Charles; in April 1645 they moved to Paris, where he met and married his second wife Margaret, maid of honour to Queen Henrietta Maria. While there, Newcastle continued his feud with Prince Rupert, suggesting to the Queen he should be removed from command.

The new Marchioness was a dramatist and romancer, and had been maid of honour to Queen Henrietta Maria. Their marriage appears to have been a very happy one, and she later wrote a biography of him. His love and admiration for his wife is best expressed in the fine sonnet he wrote as an introduction to her masterpiece &quot;The Blazing World&quot;.

Newcastle left in 1648 for Rotterdam with the intention of joining the Prince of Wales in command of the rebellious navy, and finally took up his abode at Antwerp, where he remained till the Restoration. In April 1650 he was appointed a member of Charles II&#x27;s privy council, and in opposition to Edward Hyde advocated the agreement with the Scots. In Antwerp he lived in the Rubenshuis (the house where the painter Peter Paul Rubens had lived from 1610 till his death in 1640) and established his famous riding-school, exercised &quot;the art of manège&quot; (High School riding), and published his first work on horsemanship, &quot;Méthode et invention nouvelle de dresser les chevaux&quot; in 1658. This work had an influence on one of the greatest French riding masters, François Robichon de La Guérinière, as well as a more controversial figure in dressage, Baucher. He is also said to be the inventor of draw reins.

==Restoration==

After the 1660 Stuart Restoration, Newcastle returned to England and succeeded in regaining the greater part of his estates, though burdened with debts, his wife estimating his total losses in the war at the enormous sum of £941,303. He was reinstated in the offices he had filled under Charles I and appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. He was invested in 1661 with the Order of the Garter which had been bestowed upon him in 1650, and was advanced to a dukedom (of Newcastle-on-Tyne) on 16 March 1665.

He retired, however, from politics and occupied himself with his estate and with his favourite pursuit of training horses. He established a racecourse near Welbeck, and in this period his grace composed his second work on horsemanship, a sequel to his previous work. Relying on the historical truth that dukedoms were originally the preserve of royalty, Newcastle and his wife began to refer to themselves as Prince and Princess respectively. This assumed title appears in the full title of his second work of literature. In his later years, he suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and the sudden death of his second wife was a blow from which he never recovered. With John Dryden&#x27;s assistance he translated Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Etourdi&quot; as &quot;Sir Martin Mar-all&quot; (1688). He contributed scenes to his wife&#x27;s plays, and poems of his composition are to be found among her works.

Cavendish was the patron of, among others, Jonson, Shirley, Davenant, Dryden, Shadwell and Flecknoe, and of Hobbes, Gassendi and Descartes. During their stay in Antwerp, the Cavendishes had a music chapel of 5 musicians. They were acquainted with several of the contemporary English composers, and Newcastle&#x27;s library contained a substantial collection of music of these composers.

The department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham holds a number of papers relating to the 1st Duke: the Cavendish Papers (Pw 1), part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection, includes some of his personal papers; the Portland Literary Collection (Pw V), also part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection, contains many of his literary papers; and the Newcastle (Clumber) Collection (Ne) includes some estate papers from the time of the 1st Duke, for example, relating to his purchase of Nottingham Castle.

<text>Southwest Technical Products Corporation, or SWTPC, was an American producer of electronic kits, and later complete computer systems. It was incorporated in 1967 in San Antonio, Texas, succeeding the Daniel E. Meyer Company. In 1990, SWTPC became Point Systems, before ceasing a few years later.

== History ==
In the 1960s, many hobbyist electronics magazines such as &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and &quot;Radio-Electronics&quot; published construction articles, for many of which the author would arrange for a company to provide a kit of parts to build the project. Daniel Meyer published several popular projects and successfully sold parts kits. He soon started selling kits for other authors such as Don Lancaster and Louis Garner. Between 1967 and 1971, SWTPC sold kits for over 50 &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; articles. Most of these kits were intended for audio use, such as hi-fi, utility amplifiers, and test equipment such as a function generator based on the Intersil ICL8038.

Many of these early kits used analog electronics technology, since digital technology was not yet affordable for most hobbyists. Some of the kits took advantage of new integrated circuits to allow low-cost construction of projects. For example, the new Signetics NE565 phase-locked loop chip was the core of a subsidiary communications authority (SCA) decoder board, which could be built and added to an FM radio to demodulate special programming (often, background music) not previously available to the general public. FCC regulations did not ban reception or decoding of radio transmissions, but SCA demodulation had previously required complex and expensive circuitry. Another popular new integrated circuit was the Signetics NE555, a versatile and low-cost timing oscillator chip, which was used in signal generators and simple timers. In 1972, SWTPC had a large enough collection of kits to justify printing a 32-page catalog.

In January 1975, SWTPC introduced a computer terminal kit, the &quot;TV Typewriter&quot;, or CT-1024. By November 1975, they were delivering complete computer kits based on Motorola microprocessors. They were very successful for the next 5 or so years and grew to over 100 employees. 

As the new market evolved rapidly, most of the companies that were selling a computer kit in 1975 were out of business by 1978. Around 1987, SWTPC moved to selling point of sale computer systems, eventually changing its name to Point Systems. This new company lasted only a few years.

==Microcomputer pioneers==

When microprocessors (CPU chips) became available, SWTPC became one of the first suppliers of microcomputers to the general public, focusing on designs using the Motorola 6800 and, later, the 6809 CPUs. The first such microcomputer introduced by the company, in November 1975, was the SWTPC 6800, which is also the progenitor of the widely used SS-50 bus.

Many of SWTPC&#x27;s products, including the 6800 microcomputer, were available in kit form. SWTPC also designed and supplied computer terminals, chassis, processor cards, memory cards, motherboards, I/O cards, disk drive systems, and tape storage systems. From the older &quot;TV Typewriter&quot; design a video terminal had evolved the CT-64 terminal system, which was an essential part of many early SWTPC systems. Later a more intelligent version of this terminal, the CT-82, was introduced, and a graphical terminal the GT-6144 Graphics Terminal. Still later a SS-50 bus plug-in board, the &quot;Data Systems 68 6845 Video Display Board&quot; was introduced, and a keyboard could be connected to this board. With this solution an external terminal was no longer needed.

SWTPC&#x27;s SS-50 backplane bus was also supported or used by other manufacturers: (Midwest Scientific, Smoke Signal Broadcasting, Gimix, Helix, Tano, Percom Data, Safetran), etc. It was extended to the SS-64 (for the 68000 CPU) by Helix. SWTPC also designed one of the first affordable printers available for microcomputer users; it was based on a receipt printer mechanism.

Technical Systems Consultants, first of West Lafayette, Indiana (ex Purdue University) and later of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was the foremost supplier of software for SWTPC compatible hardware. Their software included operating systems (Flex, mini-FLEX, FLEX09, and UniFLEX) and various languages (several BASIC variants, FORTRAN, Pascal, C, assemblers, etc.) and other applications. Other software, from third parties, included Introl&#x27;s C compiler, Omegasoft&#x27;s Pascal compiler, the Lucidata Pascal system (from Cambridge, UK), and assorted spread sheets and text processors. By about 1980, TSC had developed a Unix-like multi-user, multi-programming operating system (UniFlex), for 6809 systems with DMA 8&quot; floppy disks and extended memory. Several of TSC&#x27;s languages were ported to the UniFlex, as was the Lucidata Pascal system.

SWTPC&#x27;s software catalog included the TSC software, and software from many other sources (including SWTPC itself). Much of it was also available in source code, at a higher price.

Inspired by People&#x27;s Computer Company&#x27;s call for Tiny BASICs, Robert Uiterwyk wrote the MICRO BASIC 1.3 interpreter for the SWTPC 6800, which SWTPC published in the June 1976 issue of the SWTPC newsletter. Uiterwyk had handwritten the language on a legal tablet. He later expanded the language to 4K, adding support for floating-point arithmetic; this implementation was unique among BASIC interpreters by using Binary Coded Decimal to nine digits of precision, with a range up to 1099. An 8K version added string variables and trigonometry functions. Both the 4K and 8K versions were sold by SWTPC. In January 1978, Uiterwyk sold the rights of the source code to Motorola.

<text>Richard Flecknoe (c. 1600 – 1678) was an English dramatist, poet and musician. He is remembered for being made the butt of satires by Andrew Marvell in 1681 and by John Dryden in &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot; in 1682.

==Life==
Little is known of Flecknoe&#x27;s life. He was probably of English birth, from Northamptonshire, though he may have been of Irish heritage. He was a Catholic and may have been ordained a lay-priest by the Jesuits while abroad. There was once a suggestion that he may have been the nephew of the Jesuit William Flecknoe or Flexney of Oxford, though there is no evidence of this. Much of his early life seems to have been spent outside England. He attended St Omer English Jesuit School from 1619 to 1624, where he may have taken part in the annual drama productions: in 1623 the play was &quot;Guy of Warwick&quot;. After ordination as a secular priest, he continued his studies at Watten in the Netherlands until 1636, when he returned to England, but he was disappointed to find little acceptance among English Catholics, who were not favourably disposed towards Jesuits: &quot;he is none of ours&quot; said the outspoken Catholic priest Anthony Champney. Andrew Marvell encountered him in Rome in 1645, from which period dates Marvell&#x27;s satire &quot;Flecknoe, an English Priest at Rome&quot;, although it was not published until 1681. His verse is charactised there as &quot;hideous&quot; and it is also mentioned that he performed on the lute.

== Works==
Shortly after Flecknoe&#x27;s return to England in 1636 his first play, now lost, was performed in London, possibly by Queen Henrietta&#x27;s Men. Audiences derided it as &quot;lascivious&quot; and &quot;scandalous&quot;, an assessment compounded by the knowledge that the author was an ordained priest.

He provides information about his travels in his collection of letters, &quot;Relation of Ten Years&#x27; Travels in Europe, Asia, Affrique, and America&quot;, completed around 1655. It contains correspondence with friends and patrons, beginning in 1640, and comprises accounts of the Ottoman dominions in Western Asia and of a voyage to and stay in Brazil. By 1653 he was in London, when he began publishing, and so far compromised his Catholic identity as to praise Oliver Cromwell in his &quot;The idea of His Highness Oliver, late Lord Protector, with certain brief reflexions on his life&quot; (1659).

In the field of drama his &quot;Ariadne...a dramatick piece for recitative music&quot; has a claim to be the first English opera, though the musical score (also composed by himself) is now lost. He also wrote a masque, &quot;The Marriage of Oceanus and Brittania&quot;; an unacted tragi-comedy, &quot;Erminia or The Fair and Vertuous Lady&quot;; and an unacted comedy, &quot;The Demoiselles à La Mode&quot;, the plot and subplot of which were taken from Molière’s &quot;Les Précieuses Ridicules&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;École des Femmes&quot;. One other production, &quot;Love’s Dominion&quot;, a pastoral with songs, was performed privately on the continent and later acted in Restoration England as &quot;Love&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;.

Much of Flecknoe&#x27;s later poetry was epigrammatic, in the line of Ben Jonson, with aristocratic addressees, which led one critic to remark that he was &quot;better acquainted with the Nobility than with the Muses&quot;. Flecknoe explains his taste for the epigram in a dedicatory epistle which is itself epigrammatic and paradoxical: “I write chiefly to avoid idleness, and print to avoid the imputation; and as others do it to live after they are dead, I do it only not to be thought dead whilst I can live.” Its lightness is the reason he chooses this form, “who love not to take pains in anything, and rather affect a little negligence than too great curiosity”. The separate section of “Epigrams Divine and Moral” in the 1670 edition is, however, indicative of a religious seriousness persisting from his first publication some 44 years before in the devotional &quot;Hierothelamium&quot;.

He also took a moral stance in his prose works on English drama, and it may have been one of those that prompted Dryden to make him an object of satire in his &quot;Mac Flecknoe&quot; (1682), where he is depicted as the dying Monarch of Nonsense, bequeathing his title to the playwright Thomas Shadwell. The attack is unexpected, since Flecknoe had written an epigram in Dryden&#x27;s praise and both were Catholics. Robert Southey, giving it as his opinion that &quot;Flecknoe is by no means the despicable writer that we might suppose&quot; from Dryden&#x27;s vicious attack, accounted for it by supposing that Dryden was &quot;offended at his invectives against the obscenity of the stage, feeling himself more notorious, if not more culpable than any of his rivals&quot;.

One of Dryden&#x27;s later editors conjectured that &quot;the plan of the poem required a dead author and Flecknoe suited the purpose&quot;. It might also have been that Dryden believed him to be author of a pamphlet signed &quot;R. F.&quot; and published in 1668, in defence of Sir Robert Howard against Dryden in a controversy about rhyme and blank-verse, and was taking his revenge 14 years later. More recently, Paul Hammond accounts for it by the literary politics of the time and points out that many details in his depiction are drawn from the imagery of Flecknoe’s own poems.

<doc id="194455" wikidata="Q18976" url="?curid=194455" title="Ole Gunnar Solskjær">
<text>Ole Gunnar Solskjær (; born 26 February 1973) is a Norwegian professional football manager and former player who currently manages Süper Lig club Beşiktaş. He spent the majority of his playing career with Manchester United and also made 67 appearances for the Norway national team. 

A forward, Solskjær began his career in his native Norway with Clausenengen, for whom he scored 115 goals in 109 league appearances over five seasons, helping them earn promotion to the Norwegian Second Division in 1993, before moving to Molde, newly promoted to the Tippeligaen, for the 1995 season. His goals helped Molde to a second-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Cup. He joined Manchester United in July 1996 for a transfer fee of £1.5 million. Nicknamed &quot;the Baby-faced Assassin&quot;, he played 366 times for United and scored 126 goals during a successful period for the club. He was regarded as a &quot;super-sub&quot; for his knack of coming off the substitute bench to score late goals. In added time at the end of the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, he scored the winning last-minute goal against Bayern Munich, with Manchester United having trailed 1–0 as the game passed 90 minutes, and winning the treble for United. He remained a regular player for the side until a serious knee injury sustained in 2003 permanently plagued his playing career. Failing to recover from the injury, Solskjær announced his retirement from football in 2007.

Solskjær remained at Manchester United in a coaching role as well as in an ambassadorial capacity. In 2008, Solskjær became the club&#x27;s reserve team manager. He returned to his native country in 2011 to manage his former club, Molde, whom he led to their two first-ever Tippeligaen titles in his first two seasons with the club. He secured a third title when his team won the 2013 Norwegian Football Cup final. In 2014, he served as manager of Cardiff City, during which the club was relegated from the Premier League. In late 2018, Manchester United appointed Solskjær as caretaker manager, taking over from José Mourinho for the rest of the 2018–19 season. On 28 March 2019, having won 14 of his 19 matches in charge, Solskjær signed a three-year contract to take over as Manchester United manager on a permanent basis. He took Manchester United to the 2021 UEFA Europa League final, which they lost to Villarreal after a penalty shoot-out. He was sacked by the club in November 2021 following a poor run of performances during the 2021–22 season. In January 2025, after 3 years away from management, Solskjær joined Turkish Süper Lig club Beşiktaş

==Early life==
Solskjær was born in Kristiansund, Møre og Romsdal to Øyvind, a Greco-Roman wrestling champion, and Brita Solskjær. At the age of seven, he joined local football club Clausenengen, who were in the 3. divisjon. Solskjær supported Liverpool as a child. Between the ages of eight and ten, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and trained as a Greco-Roman wrestler, but gave it up due to being tossed around too much. Between 1992 and 1993, Solskjær completed a mandatory year&#x27;s national service in the Norwegian Army.

==Club career==
===Early career at Clausenengen===
Solskjær debuted for Clausenengen (CFK) at 17 years old in 1990. He participated in the Otta Cup, scoring seventeen goals in six matches. On 21 May 1993, CFK faced Molde in the Norwegian Football Cup, with Solskjær scoring Clausenengen&#x27;s only goal in their 6–1 defeat. Clausenengen were promoted to the 2. divisjon in 1993, winning the 3. division by 12 points. Solskjær&#x27;s final season at the club was in 1994, with him scoring 31 of CFK&#x27;s 47 goals, helping the club achieve a mid-table finish of sixth place. In Solskjær&#x27;s five years playing for Clausenengen, he averaged more than a goal a game in the league, scoring 115 goals in 109 matches.

===Molde===
====1995 season====
On 14 February 1995, ahead of the start of the new season, he was signed by Åge Hareide, manager of newly promoted top-flight club Molde, for a fee of NOK150,000. On 22 April 1995, Solskjær made his debut for Molde against Brann, scoring twice in a 6–0 victory. In his second game on 29 April, Solskjær scored a hat-trick helping Molde 5–4 win over Viking. On 14 May, he scored another brace in a 2–1 win over Hamarkameratene. Two days later, he netted a hat-trick as Molde thrashed Hødd 7–2. Solskjær scored a penalty in Molde&#x27;s 4–1 victory over Strindheim on 30 July.

On 10 August, Solskjær played in his first European competition, the qualification round for UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, against Belarusian team Dinamo-93 Minsk. Molde conceded in the first half but Solskjær managed to equalise in the 85th minute. He also scored in the second leg as Molde won 2–1 (3–2 on aggregate) and qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup proper. Molde were subsequently drawn against French team Paris Saint-Germain, Solskjær scored in the first leg on 14 September as the team lost 3–2 at Molde Stadion. He played in the away leg on 28 September, but Molde were outmatched and lost 3–0. Molde finished the season in second place, runners-up to Rosenborg by 15 points. In Solskjær&#x27;s first season at Molde, he scored 20 goals in 26 matches in the 1995 Tippeligaen. Solskjær also formed a good strike-partnership with fellow forwards Arild Stavrum and Ole Bjørn Sundgot; because their surnames all started with the same letter, this led to them being referred to as &quot;The Three S&#x27;s&quot;.

====1996 season====
Solskjær began the 1996 Tippeligaen in defeat, losing 2–0 to Rosenborg. However, in his next match on 21 April 1996 against Moss, he scored a hat-trick as Molde won 8–0. He scored a brace against Tromsø on 19 May in a 3–0 victory, and his goal-scoring form led to interest from Hamburg of Germany and Italian club Cagliari. Molde&#x27;s then-manager, Åge Hareide, made Solskjær available to both Everton and Hareide&#x27;s old club Manchester City for £1.2 million. However, neither Everton nor City were willing to take a risk on Solskjær, and the interest from Hamburg and Cagliari fell through after Manchester United submitted a bid of £1.5 million during Euro 1996, which Molde accepted. Solskjær made his final appearance for Molde on 21 July 1996 in a 5–1 win against Start, scoring the fourth goal in the 85th minute, before throwing his shirt to the crowd in celebration and receiving applause as he was substituted. He finished his time at Molde with 41 goals in 54 games in all competitions.

===Manchester United===
====1996–97 season: Debut====
Solskjær joined Manchester United under Alex Ferguson on 29 July 1996, and was something of a surprise acquisition as he was almost unknown outside his homeland and at the time United were still in the hunt for Blackburn Rovers and England striker Alan Shearer, who then joined Newcastle United for a world-record £15 million. As the only striker to arrive at Old Trafford that year, it was widely expected that his first season would be spent as a backup to Eric Cantona and Andy Cole with only occasional first-team opportunities. However, within weeks of his arrival it was clear that he would be a key part of the first team sooner than had been anticipated, and would also prove himself to be one of the biggest Premier League bargains of the season.

He was issued with the number 20 shirt for the 1996–97 season, a squad number he would retain for the rest of his Manchester United career. He scored six minutes into his debut as a substitute against Blackburn Rovers on 25 August 1996, after replacing David May in the 64th minute. Solskjær made his first start on 14 September in a 4–1 win against Nottingham Forest, scoring United&#x27;s first goal in the 22nd minute. On 25 September, he netted his first European goal for Manchester United in their 2–0 win over Rapid Wien, opening the scoring in the 20th minute. He scored his first brace for United against Tottenham Hotspur on 29 September, scoring the only goals of the game in the 38th and 58th minutes. On 21 December, Solskjær scored his second brace of the season as United beat Sunderland 5–0, scoring in the 35th and 48th minutes. The Norwegian started in both of United&#x27;s UEFA Champions League semi-final matches against Borussia Dortmund, which United lost 2–0 on aggregate to the eventual winners. He scored his third brace on 3 May 1997 against Leicester City in a 2–2 draw, netting in the 45th and 51st minutes. United clinched the title after Newcastle drew away at West Ham on 6 May, thus Solskjær won his first Premier League title. Solskjær scored 18 Premier League goals in 33 appearances (25 of which were starts) for United in his first season – the club&#x27;s top goalscorer for that campaign. The British media nicknamed him &quot;the Baby-faced Assassin&quot; because of his youthful looks and his deadly finishing.

====1997–98 season====
Solskjær scored his first goal of the 1997–98 season on 24 September 1997 in a 2–2 draw against Chelsea, equalising in the 86th minute after coming off the bench 20 minutes earlier. On 1 November, he scored a brace against Sheffield Wednesday during a 6–1 victory at Old Trafford, netting in the 41st and 75th minutes. Solskjær got his second brace on 30 November, scoring in the 18th and 53rd minutes of United&#x27;s 4–0 victory over Blackburn Rovers. On 24 January 1998, he scored his third brace of the season in a 5–1 win against Division Two team Walsall in the FA Cup fourth round, adding the second and fourth goals in the 35th and 67th minutes. Solskjær started in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg at Old Trafford against Monaco on 18 March (with the aggregate score at 0–0). David Trezeguet opened the scoring for Monaco inside five minutes, before Solskjær levelled in the 53rd minute, but United failed to score again and were knocked out on away goals.

Manchester United&#x27;s match against Newcastle on 18 April would become a defining moment of Solskjær&#x27;s career. The match was tied at 1–1, and Manchester United needed at least a draw to keep up with Arsenal in the race for the league title, with Solskjær being introduced in the 79th minute. Near the end of the game, Newcastle&#x27;s Rob Lee had a clear goalscoring opportunity, running unopposed towards United&#x27;s goal, but Solskjær had run across the entire field to commit a professional foul against him, thus denying Newcastle a winning goal. Solskjær did this knowing he would be sent off, and suspended for the coming matches. Supporters regarded this as an example of how Solskjær put the club above personal interest. This is the only red card Solskjær has received in his career. The Norwegian only managed six league goals in 22 appearances (15 starts) during his second season at the club, and despite his sacrifice against Newcastle, Arsenal beat Manchester United to the league title by a single point.

====1998–99 season: Continental Treble====
Solskjær stayed at Old Trafford even though other clubs showed interest in the player in 1998. He refused an offer from Tottenham Hotspur, after Manchester United had accepted a £5.5 million bid for him. He scored his first goals of the 1998–99 campaign in a 4–1 victory over Charlton Athletic on 9 September 1998, netting in the 38th and 63rd minutes. On 11 November, Solskjær put two past Nottingham Forest in a 2–1 win, helping United advance to the fifth round of the League Cup. He scored his third brace of the season against Tottenham Hotspur on 12 December, scoring in the 11th and 18th minute of an eventual 2–2 draw. After again turning down a move away from Manchester United, this time to West Ham, Solskjær came on in the 81st minute of Manchester United&#x27;s FA Cup fourth round tie against rivals Liverpool on 24 January with United 1–0 down at the time; shortly after Dwight Yorke&#x27;s equaliser, Solskjær scored the winning goal in injury time.

On 6 February, Solskjær came off the bench in the 71st minute during United&#x27;s 8–1 win over Nottingham Forest and went onto to score four goals in the last 12 minutes of the match. This has been described as one of his most impressive feats. Manchester United sealed the Premier League title on 16 May, the last day of the season, against Tottenham Hotspur after coming from behind to win 2–1, with Solskjær winning his second Premier League title in three years. Solskjær started in the 1999 FA Cup final against Newcastle on 22 May, playing the whole match as United won 2–0 and completed the double.

On 26 May, Manchester United faced German team Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final at Camp Nou. Mario Basler scored from a free kick in the sixth minute putting Bayern ahead. With United still trailing, Teddy Sheringham was introduced in the 67th minute, while Solskjær was brought on for Andy Cole in the 81st minute. Sheringham scored the equaliser at exactly 36 seconds into stoppage time, and shortly after the following kick-off United forced a corner. David Beckham took the corner kick, finding Sheringham who headed the ball across the goal, it then being poked into the roof of the net by Solskjær (the goal being timed at 90+2:17&#x27;). The Norwegian&#x27;s winning goal helped the team secure the Treble and cemented his own place in United folklore. Solskjær finished the season with 12 league goals in 19 games (9 starts).

====1999–2000 season====
Solskjær scored his first goal of the 1999–2000 season on 11 August 1999, netting in the 84th minute in a 4–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. On 2 November, he scored a sublime volley during a 2–1 victory against Austrian team Sturm Graz in the UEFA Champions League. Solskjær won the Intercontinental Cup on 30 November, as Manchester United beat Brazilian team Palmeiras 1–0 at the National Stadium in Tokyo, Japan. On 4 December, he put four goals past Everton in a 5–1 victory at Old Trafford, the second of which was Solskjær&#x27;s 50th goal for the club in all competitions. Solskjær equalised for United against Liverpool in a 1–1 draw on 4 March 2000. Three days later, he came off the bench in the 83rd minute against Bordeaux, scoring a minute later from goalkeeper Raimond van der Gouw&#x27;s long ball. Manchester United won the Premier League on 1 April after thrashing West Ham 7–1, with Solskjær getting the seventh in the 73rd minute. On 15 April, he scored a brace during a 4–0 victory over Sunderland, netting in the 2nd and 51st minutes. Four days later, Solskjær featured in the second leg of United&#x27;s UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid, but failed to score as United were knocked out 3–2 on aggregate. On 24 April, he equalised against Chelsea bringing the score to 2–2, with United going on to win 3–2. He ended the campaign with 12 league goals in 28 appearances (15 starts).

====2000–01 season====
Solskjær&#x27;s opportunities were limited at the start of the 2000–01 season, however he scored on his second start of the season on 16 September 2000 as United beat Everton 3–1. On 31 October, he netted a brace during a 3–0 victory against Watford in the League Cup third round, scoring in the 12th and 81st minutes. He scored another brace on 23 December, against Ipswich Town in a 2–0 victory. Three days later, Solskjær helped United snatch a 1–0 win against Aston Villa, with the Norwegian heading in a David Beckham cross in the 85th minute. Solskjær scored the first goal of United&#x27;s 2–1 FA Cup third round win over Fulham on 7 January 2001. On 25 February, he netted Manchester United&#x27;s fifth goal against Arsenal (their closest title rivals) in United&#x27;s 6–1 demolition, which sent them 16 points clear at the top of the table. On 10 April, he scored the winning goal in United&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Charlton Athletic, scoring only six minutes after coming on in the 76th minute. Manchester United wrapped up the Premier League title in April – their third consecutive title, and Solskjær&#x27;s fourth. That season Solskjær scored 10 league goals in 31 appearances (19 starts).

====2001–02 season====
After a few years of coming on as the super-sub, Solskjær got a chance as a starter in the 2001–02 season, paired up with Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. He took the opportunity with characteristic incisiveness, forcing Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke onto the bench. He scored his first goals of the season on 22 September 2001, in a 4–0 victory over Ipswich Town, with Solskjær netting two – the second from a difficult angle. On 23 October, Solskjær came off the bench in the 73rd minute against Olympiacos, with the score level at 0–0, and within six minutes broke the deadlock – helping United eventually win 3–0. Four days later, he came off the bench while United were 1–0 down against Leeds United, and snatched an equaliser in the 89th minute – heading in a Ryan Giggs&#x27; cross. On 12 December, he scored a brace and provided two assists in United&#x27;s 5–0 victory over Derby County, netting in the 6th and 58th minutes while setting up Roy Keane and Paul Scholes. Solskjær started the comeback against Aston Villa in the FA Cup third round on 6 January 2002, scoring in the 77th minute, as well as providing the assist for van Nistelrooy&#x27;s second goal as United won 3–2.

On 29 January, he scored a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers in Manchester United&#x27;s 4–0 win. Solskjær netted a brace against Charlton Athletic in United&#x27;s 2–0 win on 10 February, scoring in the 33rd and 74th minutes. On 26 February, Solskjær&#x27;s 29th birthday, he scored his fourth brace of the season against French team Nantes as United won 5–1. He scored yet another brace on 30 March, putting two past Leeds United as &quot;the Red Devils&quot; won 4–3. Solskjær helped Manchester United advance to the UEFA Champions League semi-final after scoring two against Deportivo La Coruña in United&#x27;s 3–2 victory on 10 April, the first only two minutes after coming on. He started against Arsenal at Old Trafford on 8 May, but failed to score as &quot;the Gunners&quot; beat United 1–0 and won the Premier League. Solskjær finished the season with 17 league goals in 30 appearances (23 starts), his best tally since his debut season at the club.

====2002–03 season====
By the 2002–03 season, both Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke had left Old Trafford, leaving Solskjær, Diego Forlán and Van Nistelrooy to compete for a place in the starting line-up. Ferguson&#x27;s persistence in playing Van Nistelrooy up front with Paul Scholes, or as a lone striker, meant that opportunities were limited. Solskjær scored Manchester United&#x27;s first goal of the season on 17 August 2002, netting the winning goal (his 100th in all competitions) against West Bromwich Albion in the 78th minute. On 19 October, he earned a point for United in a 1–1 draw against Fulham, equalising in the 61st minute.

Solskjær was subsequently given his time again when David Beckham picked up an injury and Ferguson played the Norwegian on the right wing. While proving himself to be an able crosser of the ball, Solskjær also continued to contribute with goals, scoring a total of 16 goals in the season. He was selected to play on the right in important matches, such as in the league game against Arsenal and the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid, while Beckham was left on the bench. He also captained the team in a number of matches.

====2003–06: Injury-plagued seasons====
At the start of 2003–04, Solskjær found himself as United&#x27;s first-choice right winger. However, a knee injury suffered against Panathinaikos on 16 September 2003 put Solskjær out of action until February 2004. Solskjær returned from the injury for the season run-in and was man of the match in the FA Cup semi-final victory over Arsenal. He also played in the 2004 FA Cup final, which the club won. Solskjær was forced to undergo intensive knee surgery in August 2004 and had to miss the 2004–05 season entirely.

To show their continuing support, United fans added a banner to the collection that lines the Stretford End reading &quot;20 LEGEND&quot; (Solskjær wore number 20 for United). Solskjær further solidified his status amongst United fans when he became a patron of the supporters action group, Manchester United Supporters&#x27; Trust (MUST), previously Shareholders United.

====2006–07 season: Back from injury====
Solskjær made his long-awaited return to action on 5 December 2005, playing for United&#x27;s reserves against Liverpool. Spectators numbering 2,738 showed up to witness the comeback of the popular Norwegian – an above-average turn-out for a reserve team match. He made his first-team return as a substitute in the match against Birmingham City on 28 December. He then finally made his first start in January 2006 in an FA Cup match against Burton Albion, before playing a full game as a captain in the third round replay. His return to full fitness slowly continued with regular appearances in the reserves, until on 8 March 2006 when, during a game against Middlesbrough, he was accidentally caught by Ugo Ehiogu, breaking his cheekbone. While facing the possibility of missing the rest of the season, he nevertheless appeared as a substitute against Sunderland on Good Friday. Solskjær had a successful pre-season tour in the summer of 2006 gaining Ferguson&#x27;s praise who also said he would reconsider his plan to buy a new striker.

He returned to Premier League action on 23 August 2006 when he scored in an away match against Charlton Athletic, his first Premier League goal since April 2003. Ferguson commented after the match that &quot;it was a great moment for Ole, United fans everywhere, the players and the staff&quot; and that &quot;Ole has been through a torrid time with injuries for the last two years, but he&#x27;s persevered and never lost faith and has got his repayment tonight. Everyone is over the moon for him.&quot; He continued his come-back by putting in the winning goal in the Champions League group match against Celtic at home on 13 September, fulfilling his post-injury ambition to score another goal at Old Trafford. Solskjær&#x27;s first Premier League goals at Old Trafford since his return came on 1 October when he scored both goals in the 2–0 win against Newcastle United. His goalscoring form continued when he started in the away match against Wigan Athletic and struck a sublime finish to round off a 3–1 victory, and again against Crewe Alexandra on 25 October 2006, scoring the first goal in a 2–1 away victory in the third round of the League Cup. After a further injury sustained in Copenhagen in the UEFA Champions League, Solskjær recovered and again returned to form scoring the third goal in a 3–1 home win over Wigan on Boxing Day. Solskjær continued his form by scoring United&#x27;s opening goal in their 3–2 home win over Reading on 30 December. Additionally, he came on as a substitute to score an injury-time winner in the 2–1 victory over Aston Villa at home in the FA Cup third round on 7 January 2007.

After scoring in the away FA Cup fifth round replay match against Reading on 27 February, Solskjær had further surgery on his knee. However, it was not as serious as his previous operations, and he was out of action for only a month. He was predicted to be available for the home game against Blackburn Rovers on 31 March. United manager Ferguson said: &quot;It was good timing with the international break coming up. It gave us the opportunity to get the thing done.&quot; Solskjær did make his comeback against Blackburn Rovers as a late substitute, and even scored in the 89th minute to seal Manchester United&#x27;s 4–1 win. His last match was the 2007 FA Cup final against Chelsea, but he had to settle for an FA Cup runners-up medal, as an extra-time goal from Didier Drogba gave Chelsea the victory.

On 5 June 2007, it was announced that Solskjær had undergone minor surgery after he reported discomfort in his knee while training with Norway. The surgery was a success, but Solskjær failed to fully recover and announced his retirement from professional football on 27 August 2007. On 4 September, at a home game against Sunderland, Solskjær walked onto the pitch to say goodbye to the fans and received a standing ovation. As of his retirement, Solskjær held the record for the most goals scored for Manchester United as a substitute, scoring 28 goals off the bench, as well as the most Premier League goals as a substitute with 17, a mark which has since been passed by Jermain Defoe.

====2008: Testimonial====
On 2 August 2008, a testimonial match was played in honour of Solskjær at Old Trafford against Espanyol. Almost 69,000 fans were present, setting a record as the second-highest-attended testimonial in British history. United eventually got the winner from substitute Fraizer Campbell. Solskjær appeared in the 68th minute, replacing Carlos Tevez.

====Super sub role====
At Manchester United, Solskjær earned wide acclaim for a habit of coming into matches late on as a substitute and scoring goals. Ferguson remarked that Solskjær had a knack of sitting on the bench and studying the game without taking his eye off the action. Reflecting on this aspect of his career years later, Solskjær said: &quot;I had to think about myself, how can I do the most damage for the opposition if I come on? I sat there and I studied football games but I didn&#x27;t exactly analyse their strikers. [...] Instead I would pay attention to what the defenders and full-backs were doing wrong.&quot;

==International career==
Solskjær made his international debut in a friendly match against Jamaica on 26 November 1995, just a few months before he joined Manchester United. The game finished in a 1–1 draw with Solskjær scoring the only goal for Norway. He continued his great goal scoring start by scoring three goals in his first competitive appearances for the national team during the 1998 World Cup qualifying campaign.

Solskjær played in both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 for Norway. He formed a feared partnership with Tore André Flo which was seen as one of the best striking partnerships in Norway&#x27;s history.

Following his lengthy layout to injuries Solskjær made his full game comeback on 2 September 2006, when he scored the first and last goals in a 4–1 win against Hungary in a Euro 2008 qualifying match. They would be his last goals for the national team taking his tally up to 23 goals.

On 7 February 2007, Solskjær made what proved to be his final appearance for Norway in a 2–1 defeat against Croatia, he finished with a total of 67 appearances for his country.

==Style of play and reception==
Solskjær was nicknamed &quot;the Baby-faced Assassin&quot; in the British media throughout his career, due to his youthful looks and his clinical finishing. He also earned a reputation as a &quot;super-sub&quot; in the press due to his penchant for scoring goals after coming off the bench. Although he was primarily deployed as a striker throughout his career, he was also capable of playing as a wide midfielder on either flank.

==Managerial career==
===First step into coaching===
Solskjær signed his last player contract with Manchester United on 31 March 2006, with a provision to allow him to develop his coaching credentials. He also acted in an ambassadorial role for the club, when he travelled to Hong Kong in 2006 and played with students at the Manchester United Soccer School there. When interviewed by Setanta Sports in August 2007, Solskjær confirmed he would train to be a coach after retiring from professional football, and would start to earn the required badges after his last season with Manchester United. Following his retirement, Solskjær worked for Ferguson at Old Trafford, coaching the strikers on the first team for the remainder of the 2007–08 season.

As announced on 20 May 2008, he took over the Manchester United Reserves during that summer. Solskjær was United&#x27;s first full-time reserve team manager since 2006, taking over from Brian McClair and Jimmy Ryan, who had filled the role in a caretaker capacity. He won the 2007–08 Lancashire Senior Cup by defeating the Liverpool Reserves 3–2 in the final. On 12 May 2009, Solskjær won his first Manchester Senior Cup by defeating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at the Reebok Stadium.

Shortly after the resignation of Åge Hareide as coach for the Norwegian national team, Solskjær was offered the position but he declined, saying that it was not yet the right time for him. Solskjær&#x27;s final game as Manchester United Reserves manager was a 5–1 victory over Newcastle United on 16 December 2010.

===Molde===
On 9 November 2010, Solskjær signed a four-year contract with the Norwegian club Molde to take over as manager, where he played prior to moving to Manchester United. Solskjær continued as Manchester United Reserves manager until January 2011, when he took over at Molde for the start of the new season.

On 18 March 2011, Molde played their first league game under Solskjær and suffered an embarrassing 3–0 defeat to newly promoted Sarpsborg 08. They played their first home game of the season on 3 April, where despite coming from 1–0 down to lead 2–1 they were held to a 2–2 draw by league leaders Tromsø. Molde&#x27;s first goal under Solskjær was scored in this game, by Senegalese striker Pape Paté Diouf. On 17 April 2011, Solskjær won his first Tippeligaen game at Molde with the 3–2 home win over Stabæk. On Molde&#x27;s 100 years anniversary on 19 June 2011, Solskjær led the team to a 2–0 victory over Sogndal and the top of the Tippeligaen. On 30 October 2011, Solskjær won the Tippeligaen with Molde in his first year as manager for the team.

On 18 May 2012, Molde gave Aston Villa permission to discuss their vacant managerial role with Solskjær, following the sacking of Alex McLeish. However, Solskjær decided to remain with Molde to avoid disrupting his family after they had settled back in Norway.

On 11 November 2012, Solskjær&#x27;s team, Molde, won the Tippeligaen for the second consecutive year after they beat Hønefoss 1–0, whilst their closest title challengers, Strømsgodset lost 2–1 away to Sandnes Ulf.

In 2013, Molde suffered a tough season opening with only 7 points in the first 11 matches. Under the guidance of Solskjær, Molde managed to recover and at the end of the season the team finished in sixth place with 44 points in 30 matches. On 24 November 2013, Molde beat Rosenborg 4–2 in the 2013 Norwegian Football Cup final to win the Norwegian Football Cup for the third time in the club&#x27;s history, thus securing a place in the 2014–15 Europa League qualifiers.

===Cardiff City===
On 2 January 2014, Solskjær was announced as manager of Cardiff City. The club won its first game with Solskjær in charge, coming from behind to beat Newcastle United 2–1 in the third round of the FA Cup, two days after his appointment. Cardiff then struggled for points and after defeats against Swansea City, Hull City, Crystal Palace and Sunderland, were relegated back to the Championship following a 3–0 away defeat to Newcastle. At the end of the season, Cardiff finished 20th, collecting only 7 wins and 30 points. He departed on 18 September 2014 following Cardiff City&#x27;s poor run of form at the start of the Championship campaign.

===Return to Molde===
On 21 October 2015, Solskjær returned to Molde, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract to become their new manager. His first match back in charge was the next day, with Molde defeating Celtic 3–1 at home in the Europa League group stage. His first game in the league was a 2–1 away win against Aalesunds on 25 October. He won the next, and final, two games of the 2015 Tippeligaen against Viking and Start, with Molde finishing in sixth. Meanwhile, in the Europa League group stage, Solskjær guided Molde to first place, ahead of Fenerbahçe, Ajax and Celtic. On 14 December, Molde was drawn against the title holders and eventual champions Sevilla in the Round of 32. Molde lost the away leg 3–0 on 18 February 2016 but won the home leg 1–0 on 25 February, getting knocked-out 3–1 on aggregate.

The 2016 Tippeligaen started fairly well for Solskjær with Molde winning seven, drawing three and losing two games in the first 12 matches with Molde sitting in second place. However a bad stretch of form followed with Molde failing to win their next six games, losing five of them – including a 3–1 defeat to league leaders Rosenborg on 28 May 2016. Molde then won the next four games, including a 4–2 victory over Odd on 21 August with two goals coming in stoppage time from substitutes Tobias Svendsen and Harmeet Singh. In Solskjær&#x27;s first full season back as manager, Molde finished fifth in the league after losing on the final day of the season 1–0 to Lillestrøm.

Molde&#x27;s initial form under Solskjær in the 2017 Eliteserien was mixed with the club winning their first two matches – including a stoppage time winner against Lillestrøm on 5 April 2017 – but after that they only won one of their next seven games leaving Molde in tenth. Form improved however with Molde only losing just once in the next nine games, winning six including two 3–0 victories against Tromsø and Aalesund, bringing the club up to third place. After losing the next two matches, Molde went unbeaten for the next seven games, winning six with two last minute victories against Odd and Vålerenga – seeing Molde go second. Solskjær reached the semi-final of the Norwegian Football Cup on 17 August after a 2–1 victory over Kristiansund. The match took place on 21 September with Molde losing 3–0 to Lillestrøm, who went on to win the Cup. Solskjær helped Molde finish second in his third season, seven points behind winners Rosenborg, seeing the club qualify for the first qualification round of the Europa League.

The 2018 Eliteserien was Molde&#x27;s best year under Solskjær since his return, starting the season with three wins against Sandefjord, Haugesund and Tromsø sending Molde top. After a 4–0 defeat against Rosenborg on 8 April 2018, Molde&#x27;s form began to vary with the club getting only three wins in the next eight matches leaving the club in eighth. However Solskjær oversaw Molde go undefeated over the next five games including: a 4–0 away win over Brann on 1 July; a 5–1 victory against Vålerenga on 8 July; and a 5–1 win against Brann on 12 August. On 11 July, Molde played away against Northern Irish side Glenavon in the first qualifying round of the Europa League, losing 2–1. Molde won the return leg 5–1 on 19 July, sending them through to the next qualification round. Molde were then drawn against Albanian team Laçi, beating them 5–0 on aggregate. For the third qualifying round, Molde faced Hibernian over who Solskjær led his team to a 3–0 win on aggregate. Molde were drawn against Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg on 6 August, who they faced on 23 August with Molde losing 3–1 away. Solskjær&#x27;s Molde won the return leg on 30 August 2–1 but it was not enough as Molde were knocked out 4–3 on aggregate. After suffering defeats in the league to Stabæk and Ranheim at the end of August, Solskjær led his side undefeated for the rest of the season – winning eight out of ten. His best win in this run was against title challengers Rosenborg on 30 September, who Solskjær beat 1–0. Despite this it was not enough as Molde finished the league in second place, five points behind winners Rosenborg. On 3 December 2018, Molde announced that Solskjær extended his contract till the end of the 2021 season.

===Return to Manchester United===
====2018–19 season: Caretaker period and permanent appointment ====
Manchester United appointed Solskjær as caretaker manager on 19 December 2018, taking over from José Mourinho for the rest of the 2018–19 season. He was scheduled to return to Molde in May 2019, with his assistant coach Erling Moe acting as caretaker manager during Solskjær&#x27;s absence in the pre-season and the first matches of the 2019 Eliteserien, which was scheduled to start on 31 March 2019. Solskjær later suggested that he would need to sign a new contract with Molde if he were to return, but this was refuted by Molde director Øystein Neerland, who expected Solskjær to return to Molde at the end of the English season.

Solskjær&#x27;s first match was against his former club, Cardiff City, on 22 December 2018, with United finishing as 5–1 winners. This was the first time United had scored five or more goals in a Premier League game since a 5–5 draw with West Bromwich Albion in Ferguson&#x27;s final game in charge before his retirement in May 2013. Victories in his next four league games made Solskjær the first Manchester United manager to win his first five league games in charge since Sir Matt Busby in 1946. The league winning streak was ended at six (eight in all competitions, including FA Cup wins over Reading at home and away at Arsenal) after United played out a 2–2 draw at home to Burnley on 29 January. Solskjær&#x27;s successful first full month as Manchester United manager resulted in him being named as the Premier League Manager of the Month for January 2019, during which time his team earned 10 points from a possible 12 in the league, making him the first Manchester United manager to win the award since Ferguson in October 2012 and the first Norwegian to be named either Player or Manager of the Month. Two consecutive away wins in the league against Leicester City and Fulham gave United six consecutive away victories in all competitions for the first time since May 2009, and sent them into the top four of the league table. Having picked up 25 points since taking over, Solskjær earned more points than any other manager has managed in his first nine games in charge of a single club in the Premier League. A 3–1 win at Crystal Palace on 28 February 2019 set a club record of eight consecutive away victories in all competitions.

The Champions League saw Solskjær suffer his first loss as manager, as United were beaten 2–0 at home to Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their round of 16 tie on 12 February. In the second leg at the Parc des Princes on 6 March, a Marcus Rashford penalty in the 94th minute gave Manchester United a 3–1 win, sending them through to the quarter-finals on away goals and making them the first team in the history of the European Cup to advance after losing the first leg at home by two goals or more. On 10 March, United lost 2–0 to Arsenal, their first Premier League defeat under Solskjær, dropping out of the league&#x27;s top four. On 16 March, United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 2–1 quarter-final defeat, with Solskjær commenting that this was United&#x27;s worst performance yet under his management.

On 28 March 2019, having won 14 of his 19 matches in charge, Solskjær signed a three-year contract to take over as Manchester United manager on a permanent basis. After Solskjær gained this permanent role, United won only 2 of 10 matches for the rest of the season. This included defeats in both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona in April 2019, going down 4–0 on aggregate, in which Solskjær admitted Barcelona were a &quot;couple of levels above&quot; United; a 4–0 league defeat away to Everton, also in April 2019; and in United&#x27;s final game of the season in May 2019, they lost 2–0 at home to already-relegated Cardiff, Solskjær&#x27;s former club.

United finished the Premier League season in sixth place, the same position they were when Solskjær joined as caretaker manager. United finished five points behind the fourth placed team, and 32 points behind the first placed team that season. Solskjær declared in late May 2019 that United had &quot;a big job preparing for next season with player logistics and training logistics&quot;, but the club would be &quot;ready&quot; when the next season started, and there were &quot;not going to be any excuses&quot;.

====2019–20 season: Improved league form and Cup Semi-Finals====

Under Solskjær, United started the 2019–20 season with 10 points from their first nine games, their worst start to a league campaign in 33 years (since the 1986–87 season). By January 2020, they lost 2–0 to Burnley at Old Trafford, leaving United with a league record of 34 points from 24 games, which was worse than the previous season&#x27;s tally at that point. In that match, United&#x27;s players were booed by their own fans; vitriolic chants were directed at the Glazers, United&#x27;s owners, and vice-chairman Ed Woodward by fans; and thousands left Old Trafford before the final whistle. Former United player Darren Fletcher commented that &quot;the atmosphere [at Old Trafford] really turned toxic for the first time&quot;. Solskjær stated that the &quot;players are giving everything&quot;, and called for fans to &quot;stick together&quot; to &quot;help the club to move forward&quot;. Also that month, United were knocked out of the EFL Cup at the semi-final stage after losing 3–2 on aggregate over two legs to Manchester City.

After new United signing Bruno Fernandes made his debut, United went unbeaten for the rest of the Premier League season, with 32 points from 14 games since February 2020, more than any other club in that period. CNN described United as &quot;a team lacking creativity, quality and leadership&quot; producing &quot;poor&quot; football before Fernandes&#x27; arrival, but &quot;signs of new life under Solskjaer&quot; emerged by the end of the season, with Fernandes a key spark. United finished the season with 66 points in the Premier League, equal to the previous season&#x27;s points tally, but now in third place instead of sixth. Solskjær declared that the third-place league finish was a &quot;massive achievement&quot;, &quot;with this team and this squad, and where we have been with this rebuild&quot;. With United finishing the league 33 points behind Liverpool and 15 behind Manchester City, Solskjær stated it would be a &quot;massive challenge&quot; to outdo these teams the next season.

Late in the season, United were knocked out of two more competitions at the semi-final stage. In the FA Cup, United suffered a 3–1 loss to Chelsea; Solskjær dropped usual FA Cup goalkeeper Sergio Romero in favour of David de Gea, but the latter made two errors leading to two Chelsea goals. In the Europa League, the last game of United&#x27;s season saw United succumbing to a 2–1 loss to Sevilla. Solskjær did not make any substitutions until the 87th minute of the game, and again dropped usual Europa League goalkeeper Romero in favour of de Gea. Solskjaer had said before this game that &quot;semi-finals are not good enough for Manchester United&quot;; after the game Solskjaer reacted: &quot;when you don&#x27;t take the chances it&#x27;s going to be hard&quot;, United&#x27;s players had &quot;tired legs and tired minds&quot;, and that United &quot;definitely need to improve&quot;.

====2020–21 season: 2nd in the league and Europa League Final====
Under Solskjær, United had a slow start to the 2020–21 Premier League season, starting the campaign with a 3–1 loss to Crystal Palace at home and scoring seven points from their first six league games, placing them 15th in the league table. This included a 6–1 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur in October, United&#x27;s joint heaviest defeat in the Premier League, that saw Solskjær stating it was the worst day of his managerial career; as well as a 1–0 home loss to Arsenal in November, which was Solskjær&#x27;s 100th match in charge of United, where Solskjær reacted by saying that United&#x27;s players &quot;didn&#x27;t turn up&quot;.

Meanwhile, in the Champions League, United were knocked out in the group stage when they finished third in their group, with one win and one loss against each of their opponents, Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig and İstanbul Başakşehir. This result sent United into the Europa League.

Back in the Premier League, after eight wins in 10 Premier League games, United travelled to Burnley on 12 January 2021 and won 1–0. This put United at the top of the league table after 17 league games, which was the first occasion this happened since the 2012–13 title-winning season under Sir Alex Ferguson. &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that United exemplified &quot;unerring determination&quot; in this game, which was &quot;a theme of United&#x27;s season&quot; so far. However, United were soon caught by Manchester City, and with a 2–1 home loss to bottom-of-the-table Sheffield United on 27 January 2021, failed to regain the top spot. While &quot;BBC Sport&quot; described United as &quot;desperately poor&quot;, Solskjær suggested that United were unlucky since United had been the &quot;most consistent team&quot; that season, and stating that there &quot;will be no big inquest&quot; into the loss.

Since the Sheffield United loss, United went on a 14-match unbeaten run in the league. On 2 February, Solskjær oversaw United scoring a record equalling nine goals in a 9–0 victory over Southampton as the latter team received two red cards. It was the third time such a feat had been achieved in the Premier League, with Manchester United being first to do so against Ipswich in 1995. On 9 May, United came from behind to nail a 3–1 away win against Aston Villa, thus confirming a top-four finish to the season and Champions League qualification. With this victory, United set a record of winning 10 league matches that they conceded first in within a season. On 11 May, United&#x27;s unbeaten run was ended by Leicester City with a 2–1 loss at Old Trafford, after Solskjær drastically changed his starting line-up due to fixture congestion after United were scheduled to face Villa,Leicester and Liverpool in the space of five days between 9 May 2021 and 13 May 2021 after United&#x27;s fixture with Liverpool was postponed due to 2021 Old Trafford protests. This result handed Manchester City the Premier League as United could no longer mathematically catch them.

Manchester United finished runners-up in the Premier League with 74 points, 12 points behind champions Manchester City, and qualified for the Champions League group stage. This was United&#x27;s first back-to-back top-four finish since Sir Alex Ferguson&#x27;s retirement.

In the EFL Cup, United were eliminated in the semi-final in January 2021 by Manchester City with a 2–0 home loss. In the FA Cup, despite knocking out Liverpool in the fourth round in a 3–2 win at Old Trafford in January 2021, United were later knocked out by the eventual winners Leicester City in the quarter-final in March 2021 with a 3–1 away loss.

In the Europa League, United eliminated Milan in the round of 16 with an aggregate win of 2–1 over two legs in March 2021, then later eliminated Roma in the semi-finals with an aggregate win of 8–5 over two legs. In the Europa League final on 26 May, United lost 11–10 on penalties to Villarreal after a 1–1 draw. Solskjær was criticised by some fans for his decision to make his first substitution 10 minutes into extra time.

====2021–22 season: Dip in performances and departure ====
On 24 July 2021, Manchester United announced that Solskjær had signed a three-year contract extension until 2024, with an option for a further year, till 2025. United kicked off their 2021–22 UEFA Champions League campaign on 14 September 2021 with a 2–1 loss to Swiss club Young Boys, Cristiano Ronaldo scored early on. However, United would be down a man after Wan-Bissaka got sent off, allowing Young Boys to come back to win the game 2–1 with a late goal. In the Premier League, United started off strong with a 5–1 win at home vs Leeds with Bruno Fernandes scoring a hattrick and Paul Pogba registering four assists in that game. United would go on to get 13 points in their opening five games. Under Solskjær, on 19 September, Ronaldo and Jesse Lingard scored goals in Manchester United&#x27;s 2–1 win over West Ham United at the London Stadium to set a new record for being unbeaten in 29 away games in the Premier League.

A run of poor results started on 25 September with a 1–0 loss at home to Aston Villa. This preceded a one all draw at home vs Everton and a 4–2 loss at Leicester that ended their unbeaten away run. On 24 October, Solskjær oversaw a 5–0 home loss to arch-rivals Liverpool; United&#x27;s worst result against Liverpool since 1925. On 6 November, they lost 2–0 in the Manchester derby against rivals Manchester City. On 20 November, after losing 4–1 to Watford and conceding 15 goals in their last five league fixtures, it was reported the club&#x27;s board of directors held an emergency meeting and decided to sack and part ways with Solskjær and label the departure of Solskjær as mutual consent. On 21 November, Manchester United confirmed that Solskjær had left his role as manager. At the time of his departure, Manchester United were seventh in the Premier League table with 17 points after 12 games and United had only one win in the last seven games Solskjær managed. First-team coach and former player Michael Carrick took over as caretaker until Ralf Rangnick&#x27;s appointment in December as interim manager until the end of the season. Erik ten Hag took over as permanent manager ahead of the 2022–23 season.

===Beşiktaş===
Solskjær was appointed head coach of Süper Lig club Beşiktaş on 18 January 2025 on a one-and-a-half-year contract.

==Personal life==
During his time as a player for Manchester United, Solskjær lived in Bramhall with his wife, Silje, and their three children, Noah, Karna and Elijah. Two of the children are footballers: Noah plays as a midfielder, while Karna plays as a forward for AaFK Fortuna and is a product of the Manchester United academy. She made one senior appearance for United, debuting in the 2021–22 Women&#x27;s FA Cup against Bridgwater United, in doing so she and Ole became the first father-daughter pair to play for Manchester United. Solskjær was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2001.

On 24 October 2008, Solskjær was awarded the First Class Knighthood of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav by King Harald V of Norway. He was presented with the award in a ceremony the next day in his hometown of Kristiansund. Solskjær is the youngest-ever recipient of the knighthood, usually bestowed upon notable members of society in their later years.

In 2009, the Norwegian parliament awarded Solskjær its annual Peer Gynt Prize for his work as worthy ambassador of sport and for his &quot;great social commitment&quot;, in a ceremony at Vinstra Hall. The ex-footballer laughingly admitted in the subsequent press conference that he had neither read nor seen the Ibsen play, yet, but now intends to.

Politically, he supports the Norwegian Labour Party and visited their congress in 2011. In a speech delivered there, he publicly pronounced his left-wing political sympathies.
