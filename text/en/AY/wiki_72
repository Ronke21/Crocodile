<text>The Quebec Liberal Party (QLP; , PLQ) is a provincial political party in Quebec. It has been independent of the federal Liberal Party of Canada since 1955. The QLP has always been associated with the colour red; each of their main opponents in different eras have been generally associated with the colour blue.

The QLP has traditionally supported a form of Quebec federalist ideology with nuanced Canadian nationalist tones that supports Quebec remaining within the Canadian federation, while also supporting reforms that would allow substantial autonomism in Quebec. In the context of federal Canadian politics, it is a more centrist party when compared to Conservative and Liberal parties in other provinces, such as the former British Columbia Liberal Party.

== History ==
=== Pre-Confederation ===
The Liberal Party is descended from the Parti canadien (or Parti Patriote), who supported the 1837 Lower Canada Rebellion, and the Parti rouge, who fought for responsible government and against the authority of the Roman Catholic Church in Lower Canada.
The most notable figure of this period was Louis-Joseph Papineau.

=== Post-Confederation ===
The Liberals were in opposition to the ruling Conservatives for most of the first 20 years after Canadian Confederation, except for 18 months of Liberal minority government in 1878–1879. However, the situation changed in 1885 when the federal Conservative government refused to commute the death sentence of Louis Riel, the leader of the French-speaking Métis people of western Canada. This decision was unpopular in Quebec. Honoré Mercier rode this wave of discontent to power in 1887, but was brought down by a scandal in 1891. He was later cleared of all charges. The Conservatives returned to power until 1897.
The Liberals won the 1897 election, and held power without interruption for the next 39 years; the Conservatives never held power in Québec again. This mirrored the situation in Ottawa, where the arrival of Wilfrid Laurier in the 1896 federal election marked the beginning of Liberal Party of Canada dominance at the federal level. Notable long-serving Premiers of Quebec in this era were Lomer Gouin and Louis-Alexandre Taschereau.

By 1935, the Conservatives had an ambitious new leader, Maurice Duplessis. Duplessis merged his party with dissident ex-Liberals who had formed the Action libérale nationale. Duplessis led the new party, the Union Nationale (UN), to power in the 1936 election. The Liberals returned to power in the 1939 election, but lost it again in the 1944 election. They remained in opposition to the Union Nationale until one year after Duplessis&#x27;s death in 1959.

In 1955, the PLQ severed its affiliation with the Liberal Party of Canada.

=== 1960–1995 ===
Under Jean Lesage, the party won an historic election victory in 1960, ending sixteen years of rule by the national-conservative &quot;Union Nationale&quot;. This marked the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, which dramatically changed Québec society. During the 1960s a social-democratic faction within the party was especially prominent and the party was seen as being on the centre-left. Under the slogans &quot;C&#x27;est l&#x27;temps qu&#x27;ça change&quot; (it&#x27;s time for change) in 1960 and &quot;maîtres chez nous&quot; (masters in our own house) in 1962, the Quebec government undertook several major initiatives, including:
* Full nationalization of the electricity industry through merger of 11 private companies with the government-owned Hydro-Québec — this major initiative of the government was led by the minister of natural resources, René Lévesque, in 1963.
* Creation of a public pension plan, the &quot;Régie des rentes du Québec&quot; (QPP/RRQ), separate from the Canada Pension Plan that exists in all other provinces of Canada, and creation of &quot;Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec&quot; (CDPQ).
* Elimination of tuition fees for public elementary &amp; secondary schools and creation of the &quot;Ministère de l&#x27;éducation du Québec&quot;.
* Secularisation of schools and hospitals.
* Creation of the &quot;Société générale de financement&quot; (SGF).
* Creation of the first incarnation of the &quot;Office québécois de la langue française&quot; (OQLF, originally OLF).
* Mandatory call for bids for all public works contracts above $25,000 (René Lévesque, 1960).
* Creation of &quot;Obligations d&#x27;épargne du Québec&quot; (Québec savings bonds) in 1963.
* Right to strike in public service (1964).
* Creation of an office in Paris, introduction of the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine (meaning that Québec has rights to its own international presence matching its domestic range of jurisdiction).
Under Lesage, the Liberals developed a Quebec nationalist wing. In July 1964, the Quebec Liberal Federation led by Lesage formally disaffiliated from the federal Liberal Party of Canada, making the Quebec Liberal Party a distinct organization from its federal counterpart.

In October 1967, former cabinet minister René Lévesque proposed that the party endorse his plan for sovereignty-association. The proposal was rejected and, as a result, some Liberals, including Lévesque, left the Liberals to join the sovereignty movement, participating in the founding of the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; (PQ) under Lévesque&#x27;s leadership.

Relations soured between the Quebec Liberal Party and the federal Liberal Party under Lesage, and worsened further under Robert Bourassa, who had a poor relationship with Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

First elected in 1970, Robert Bourassa instituted Bill 22 to introduce French as the official language in Quebec, and pushed Trudeau for constitutional concessions. Reelected in 1973, his government was also embarrassed by several scandals. Bourassa resigned from the party&#x27;s leadership after the loss of the 1976 election to René Lévesque&#x27;s &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;.

Bourassa was succeeded as Liberal leader by Claude Ryan, the former director of the respected Montréal newspaper, &quot;Le Devoir&quot;. Ryan led the successful federalist campaign in the 1980 Quebec referendum on Québec sovereignty, but then lost the 1981 election. He resigned as Liberal leader some time later, paving the way for the return of Robert Bourassa.

When Bourassa returned as Premier in 1985, he persuaded the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney to recognize Quebec as a distinct society, and sought greater powers for Quebec and the other provinces. This resulted in the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord. Both of these proposals, however, were not ratified. While a Quebec nationalist, Bourassa remained an opponent of independence for Quebec.

Daniel Johnson Jr. succeeded Bourassa as Liberal leader and Premier of Québec in 1994, but soon lost the 1994 election to the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; under Jacques Parizeau.

In 1993, after the failure of the Charlottetown Accord, many nationalist members of the Liberal party led by Jean Allaire and Mario Dumont, including many from the party&#x27;s youth wing, left to form the &quot;Action démocratique du Québec&quot; (ADQ) because the Liberal Party dropped most of its autonomist demands during the negotiation of the Charlottetown Accord. As in 1980, the PLQ campaigned successfully for a &quot;no&quot; vote in the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty.

=== 1998–present ===
Around the time of the 1998 Quebec general election, the party was referred to as being on the centre-right of the political spectrum.

The Liberals regained power in the 2003 election. Premier Jean Charest was a federal cabinet minister with the now-defunct Progressive Conservative Party including a stint as Deputy Prime Minister and even serving as its leader for a time. The QLP government proposed a policy of reform of social programs and cuts to government spending and the civil service, and established a controversial health system fee for all taxpayers.

It has also softened language policies. In response to a Supreme Court of Canada decision overruling a loophole-closing stopgap measure enacted by the Bernard Landry government, the Liberals enacted Loi 104 which provides for English-language, unsubsidized private school students to transfer into the subsidized English-language system, thus receiving the right to attend English schools in Québec for their siblings and all descendants, should the student demonstrate a bureaucratically-defined &quot;parcours authentique&quot; within the English system. Meanwhile, the Office québécois de la langue française (Quebec Board of the French Language) under the Liberal provincial government has also opted for a demand-side strategy for the enforcement of language laws, using a number of publicity campaigns, including stickers which merchants may voluntarily affix on their shop windows stating that French service may be obtained within, allowing for consumers to &quot;choose&quot; stores which will serve them in French.

The Liberal party suffered a major setback in the 2007 election, which saw them reduced to a minority government, having lost francophone support to the surging ADQ. However, the party regained a majority in the 2008 election, which saw the collapse of ADQ support and the return of the Parti Québécois as the main opposition party. Election turnout was the lowest in Québec since the Quiet Revolution.

Since its most recent election, the Liberal government has faced a number of scandals, including historic losses at the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the attribution of highly sought-after subsidized daycare spaces to Liberal Party donors, as well as allegations of systemic construction industry corruption which arose notably during the 2009 Montréal municipal election. After public pressure, the Liberal government eventually called for a public commission of inquiry. Jean Charest&#x27;s personal approval ratings have at times been lower than those of other premiers.

In 2012, the Liberal government announced it was going to raise university tuition from $2,168 to $3,793 in increments between 2012 and 2017. This move proved controversial, leading to a significant portion of Quebec post-secondary students striking against the measures. In response to the discord the Quebec Liberal government introduced controversial emergency legislation via Bill 78 that restricted student protest activities, attacking students&#x27; right to strike and to demonstrate peacefully, and dealt with the administrative issues resulting from so many students missing classes.

After almost a decade in power, the Liberal government of Jean Charest was defeated in the 2012 provincial election by the Parti Québécois led by Pauline Marois. Charest was also personally defeated in his constituency and resigned as party leader.

They came back into power during the 2014 election under Philippe Couillard. In the 2018 election, they became the official opposition.

The contemporary Quebec Liberal Party is a broad-based federalist and multiculturalist coalition including among its members some supporters of the federal Liberals, New Democratic Party, Bloc Québécois, Greens, and Conservatives. In terms of voter support, it has always been able to rely on the great majority of non-Francophone people in Quebec, in other words, the great majority of Anglophones and Allophones.

=== Opposition ===
The Quebec Liberal Party has faced various opposing parties in its history. Its main opposition from the time of the Confederation (1867) to the 1930s was the Parti conservateur du Québec. That party&#x27;s successor, the Union Nationale, was the main opposition to the Liberals until the 1970s. Since then the Liberals have alternated in power with the Parti Québécois, a Quebec sovereigntist, self-described social-democratic party and very recently with the Coalition Avenir Québec, a Quebec autonomist and conservative party.

<text>The Quiet Revolution () was a period of socio-political and socio-cultural transformation in French Canada, particularly in Quebec, following the 1960 Quebec general election. This period was marked by the secularization of the government, the establishment of a state-administered welfare state known as the , a shift in political alignment toward federalist and sovereigntist (or separatist) factions (each faction influenced by Quebec nationalism), and the eventual election of a pro-sovereignty provincial government in the 1976 election. While the Quiet Revolution is often associated with the efforts of the Liberal Party of Quebec&#x27;s government led by (elected in 1960) and, to some extent, (elected in 1970 after Daniel Johnson of the in 1966), its profound impact has influenced the policies of most provincial governments since the early 1960s.

A primary change was an effort by the provincial government to assume greater control over healthcare and education, both of which had previously been under the purview of the Catholic Church. To achieve this, the government established ministries of Health and Education, expanded the public service, made substantial investments in the public education system, and permitted the unionization of the civil service. Additionally, measures were taken to enhance Quebecois control over the province&#x27;s economy, including the nationalization of electricity production and distribution, the creation of the Canada/Québec Pension Plan, and the establishment of in an effort to nationalize Quebec&#x27;s electric utilities. Furthermore, during this period, French Canadians in Quebec adopted the term to distinguish themselves from both the rest of Canada and France, solidifying their identity as a reformed province.

The Quiet Revolution ushered in a period of significant economic and social development not only in Quebec but also in French Canada and Canada as a whole. This transformation coincided with similar developments occurring in the Western world in general. It brought about notable changes to the physical organization and social structures of Montreal, Quebec&#x27;s principal city. The impact of the Quiet Revolution extended beyond Quebec&#x27;s borders, influencing contemporary Canadian politics. Concurrent with the rise of Quebecois nationalism during this era, French Canadians made substantial strides in shaping the structure and direction of the federal government and national policies.

==Origins ==
The 1950s tenure of Quebec Premier epitomized the conservative ideal of a religiously and culturally pure Québec, and became known among liberals as the (&#x27;Great Darkness&#x27;), although the Richard Riot of 1955 may have signaled growing submerged forces. Soon after Duplessis&#x27; death, the June 1960 provincial election installed the Liberal provincial government of , and the Quiet Revolution began.

Prior to the 1960s, the government of Québec was controlled by the conservative Duplessis, leader of the Union Nationale party. Not all the Catholic Church supported Duplessis – some Catholic unions and members of the clergy criticized him, including Montreal Archbishop – but the bulk of the small-town and rural clergy supported him. Some quoted the slogan (&#x27;The sky (Heaven) is blue, Hell is red&#x27;) as a reference to the colors of the (blue) and the Liberals (red), the latter accused often of being pro-communist. Radio-Canada, the newspaper and political journal were intellectual forums for critics of the Duplessis Government.

Prior to the Quiet Revolution, the province&#x27;s natural resources were developed mainly by foreign investors, such as the US-based Iron Ore Company of Canada. In the spring of 1949, a group of 5,000 asbestos miners went on strike for three months against a foreign corporation. They were supported by Joseph Charbonneau (Bishop of Montreal), the Québécois nationalist newspaper , and a small group of intellectuals. Until the second half of the 20th century, the majority of Francophone Québec workers lived below the poverty line, and Francophones did not join the executive ranks of the businesses of their own province. Political activist and singer Félix Leclerc wrote: &quot;Our people are the waterboys of their own country&quot;.

In many ways, Duplessis&#x27;s death in 1959, quickly followed by the sudden death of his successor Paul Sauvé, triggered the Quiet Revolution. The Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage and campaigning under the slogans (&quot;Things have to change&quot;) and (&quot;Masters of our own house&quot;, a phrase coined by editor André Laurendeau), was voted into power within a year of Duplessis&#x27;s death.

On March 28, 1969, a significant street demonstration took place in Montreal, known as . The primary objective of this protest was to advocate for McGill University to become a French-speaking educational institution.

It is generally accepted that the revolution ended before the October Crisis of 1970, but Québec society has continued to change dramatically since then, notably with the rise of the sovereignty movement, evidenced by the election of the sovereigntist (first in 1976 by René Lévesque), the formation of a sovereigntist political party representing Québec on the federal level, the (founded in 1991 by Lucien Bouchard), as well as the 1980 and 1995 sovereignty referendums. Some scholars argue that the rise of the Québec sovereignty movement during the 1970s is also part of this period.

==Secularization and education==
The Canadian Constitution of 1867 made education the responsibility of the province. Québec set up a Ministry of Public Instruction in 1868 but abolished it in 1875 under pressure from the Catholic Church. The clergy believed it would be able to provide appropriate teaching to young people and that the province should not interfere. By the early 1960s, there were more than 1,500 school boards, each responsible for its own programs, textbooks and the recognition of diplomas according to its own criteria.

In addition, until the Quiet Revolution, higher education was accessible to only a minority of French Canadians because of the generally low level of formal education and the expense involved. Moreover, secondary schools had placed a lot more emphasis on the liberal arts and soft sciences than the hard sciences.

Following World War II, while most of the United States and Canada was enjoying a long period of prosperity and modernization, economic growth was slower in Québec. The level of formal schooling among French-Canadians was quite low: only 13% finished grade 11, as opposed to 36% of English Canadians. One of the most scathing attacks on the educational system was levelled by Brother , writing under the pseudonym of . The publication of his book (1960) quickly sold over 100,000 copies and has come to be recognized as having important impact on the beginning of the Quiet Revolution.

 presided over a commission established in 1961 to study the education system and bring forth recommendations, which eventually led to the adoption of several reforms, the most important of which was secularization of the education system. In 1964 a Ministry of Education was established with appointed the first Minister of Education since 1875. Although schools maintained their Catholic or Protestant character, in practice they became secular institutions. Reforms included raising the age for compulsory schooling from 14 to 16; providing free schooling until the 11th grade; reorganizing school boards; standardizing school curricula; and replacing classical colleges, first with (publicly funded pre‑university colleges) in 1965, then the network in 1969. The reforms were an effort to improve access to higher education, geographically and financially. Additionally, more emphasis was placed on the hard sciences, and there was now work for the Québécois who had previously needed to leave the province in order to find jobs in their preferred fields. For example, the opening of meant that skilled engineers needed to be hired.

Also during this period the Ministry of Social Affairs was created, which in June 1985 became the Ministry of Health and Social Services, responsible for the administration of health and social services in the province.

The Quiet Revolution combined declericalization with the radicalized implementation of Vatican II. There was a dramatic change in the role of nuns, which previously had attracted 2–3% of Québec&#x27;s young women. Many left the convent while very few young women entered. The Provincial government took over the nuns&#x27; traditional role as provider of many of Québec&#x27;s educational and social services. Often ex-nuns continued the same roles in civilian dress; and for the first time men started entering the teaching profession.

Also during the time of the Quiet Revolution, Quebec experienced a large drop in the total fertility rate (known as TFR: the lifetime average number of live births per woman of child-bearing age) falling from 3.8 in 1960 to 1.9 in 1970. According to a study commissioned in 2007 by the Québec Ministry of Families, Seniors and Status of Women on possible ways to address problems related to a by then even lower TFR (1.6) &quot;Starting in 1960, Québec experienced a drop in fertility that was so sharp and rapid, it was almost unparalleled in the developed countries.&quot;

The 2003 article &quot;Where Have All the Children Gone?&quot;, published in the academic journal &quot;Canadian Studies in Population&quot; by Professor Catherine Krull of Queen&#x27;s University and Professor Frank Trovato of the University of Alberta, points out the decline in influence of the Roman Catholic Church over the lives of French-Canadians as one of the causes of the great reduction in the TFR during the Quiet Revolution. According to Professor Claude Belanger of Montreal&#x27;s Marianopolis College, the loss of influence of the Roman Catholic Church and subsequent abandonment of long adhered to Church teachings concerning procreation was a key factor in Quebec going from having the highest provincial birth rate in 1960 to the lowest in 1970.

==Economic reforms ==
Seeking a mandate for its most daring reform, the nationalization of the province&#x27;s electric companies under , the Liberal Party called for a new election in 1962. The Liberal party was returned to power with an increased majority in the Legislative Assembly of Québec and within six months, , Minister of Natural Resources, enacted his plans for . The project grew to become an important symbol in Québec. It demonstrated the strength and initiative of the Québec government and was a symbol of the ingenuity of Québécois in their capability to complete such an ambitious project. The original project ushered in an era of &quot;megaprojects&quot; that would continue until 1984, seeing Québéc&#x27;s hydroelectric network grow and become a strong pillar of the province. Today, remains a crucial element to the Québec economy, with annual revenues of $12.7 billion Canadian dollars, $1.1 billion going directly into the province&#x27;s coffers.

More public institutions were created to follow through with the desire to increase the province&#x27;s economic autonomy. The public companies SIDBEC (iron and steel), SOQUEM (mining), REXFOR (forestry) and SOQUIP (petroleum) were created to exploit the province&#x27;s natural resources. This was a massive shift away from the Duplessis era in which Québec&#x27;s abundant natural resources were hardly utilized. Duplessis&#x27; policy was to sell off untransformed natural resources at bargain prices in order to create more employment in Québec&#x27;s regions. This strategy, however, proved weak as Québec&#x27;s natural resources were exploited for little profit. The shift in mentality of the Quiet Revolution allowed Québec to gain further financial autonomy by accessing this area of the economy which, as is evidenced by , is extremely profitable. The Société générale de financement (General financing corporation) was created in 1962 to encourage Québécois to invest in their economic future and to increase the profitability of small companies. In 1963, in conjunction with the Canada Pension Plan the government of Canada authorized the province to create its own (, &#x27;Québec Pension Plan&#x27;); universal contributions came into effect in 1966. The (, &#x27;Québec Deposit and Investment Fund&#x27;) was created in 1965 to manage the considerable revenues generated by the RRQ and to provide the capital necessary for various projects in the public and private sectors.

A new labour code () was adopted in 1964. It made unionizing much easier and gave public employees the right to strike. It was during the same year that the (&#x27;Civil Code&#x27;) was modified to recognize the legal equality of spouses. In case of divorce, the rules for administering the Divorce Act were retained using Québéc&#x27;s old community property matrimonial regime until 1980, when new legislation brought an automatic equal division of certain basic family assets between spouses.

==Nationalism==

The societal and economic innovations of the Quiet Revolution, which empowered Québec society, emboldened certain nationalists to push for political independence.
While visiting Montreal for Expo 67, General proclaimed in a speech at Montreal City Hall, which gave the Québec independence movement further public credibility. In 1968, the sovereigntist was created, with as its leader. A small faction of Marxist sovereignists began terrorist actions as the , the zenith of their activities being the 1970 October Crisis, during which British diplomat James Cross as well as Labour Minister Pierre Laporte were both kidnapped by FLQ cells, with Laporte eventually being killed.

The twice led the Québécois people through unsuccessful referendums, the first in 1980 on the question of political sovereignty with economic association to Canada (also known as sovereignty association), and the second in 1995 on full sovereignty.

In 1977, during their first term in office, the enacted the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot;, known more commonly as &quot;Bill 101&quot;, whose goal is to protect the French language by making it the language of business in Québec, as well as restricting the use of English on signs. The bill also restricted the eligibility for elementary and high school students to attend school in English, allowing this only for children of parents who had studied in English in Québec. Children may also be eligible for English education if their parents or grandparents received a certain amount of English education outside of the province (ex. another Canadian province). Once a child has been permitted to attend an English primary or high school, the remaining children in that family are also granted access. This bill still stands today, although many reforms have been made in an attempt to make it less harsh.

==Historiography==
Several historians have studied the Quiet Revolution, presenting somewhat different interpretations of the same basic facts. For example, Cuccioletta and Lubin raised the question of whether it was an unexpected revolution or an inevitable evolution of society. Behiels asked, how important are economic factors such as outside control of Québec&#x27;s finance and industry? Was the motivating force one of liberalism or one of nationalism? Gauvreau raised the issues of religious factors, and of the changes going on inside the Catholic Church. Seljak felt that the Catholic Church could have responded with a more vocal opposition.

===A revolution or a natural course of action? ===

Modern Québec historians have brought some nuance to the importance of the Quiet Revolution. Though the improvements made to Québec society during this era make it seem like an extremely innovative period, it has been posited that these changes follow a logical revolutionary movement occurring throughout the Western world in the 1960s. Québec historian took this revisionist stance in arguing that the Quiet Revolution may have accelerated the natural evolution of Quebec&#x27;s francophone society rather than having turned it on its head.

Several arguments support this view. From an economic perspective, Quebec&#x27;s manufacturing sector had seen important growth since the Industrial Revolution. Buoyed by significant manufacturing demand during World War I and World War II, the Québec economy was already expanding before the events of the Quiet Revolution.

Rouillard also argues that traditional portrayals of the Quiet Revolution falsely depict it as the rise of Liberalism in Québec. He notes the popularity enjoyed by federal Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier as well as the Premiership of as examples of Québec Liberalism prior to the events of the Quiet Revolution. The administration was extremely innovative. Its achievements include nationalizing the electricity distribution network of the city of Montreal, granting universal suffrage, instituting mandatory schooling until the age of 14 and establishing various social programs in Québec.

The perception of the Quiet Revolution as a great upheaval in Québec society persists, but the revisionist argument that describes this period as a natural continuation of innovations already occurring in Québec cannot be omitted from any discussion on the merits of the Quiet Revolution. The historiography of the period has been notably explored by Ronald Rudin, who describes the legacy of the years in the depiction of what preceded them. Though criticized as apologists for , Robert Rumilly and Conrad Black did add complexity to the narrative of neo-nationalists by contesting the concept of a , the idea that Duplessis&#x27;s tenure in office was one of reactionary policies and politics. Dale Thomson, for his part, noted that , far from seeking to dismantle the traditional order, negotiated a transition with (and sought to accommodate) Québéc&#x27;s Catholic Church. Several scholars have lately sought to mediate the neo-nationalist and revisionist schools by looking at grassroots Catholic activism and the Church&#x27;s involvement in policy-making.

====Federal politics ====

Politics at the federal level were also in flux. In 1957, the federal government passed the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostic Services Act. This was, effectively, the beginning of a pan-Canadian system of publicly funded health care. In 1961, Prime Minister Diefenbaker instituted the National Hospital Insurance Plan, the first public health insurance plan adhered to by all the provinces. In 1966, the National Medicare program was created.

Federal politics were further influenced by the election of in 1968. The rise to power of arguably Canada&#x27;s most influential Prime Minister was unique in Canadian politics. The charisma and charm he displayed throughout his whirlwind campaign swept up much of the country in what would be referred to as Trudeaumania. Before the end of the 1960s, Trudeau would pass the Official Languages Act (1969), which aimed to ensure that all federal government services were available in both of Canada&#x27;s official languages. By the end of the 1960s, Trudeau had also passed legislation decriminalizing homosexuality and certain types of abortion.

====Municipal politics ====

Montreal municipal politics were also going through an important upheaval. became Montreal mayor on October 24, 1960. Within the first few years of his tenure, Drapeau oversaw a series of infrastructure projects, including the expansion of Dorval airport (now Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport), the opening of the Champlain bridge and the renaissance of Old Montreal. He also oversaw the construction and inauguration of . Drapeau was also instrumental in the construction of the Montreal metro system, which was inaugurated on October 14, 1966. Under Drapeau, Montreal was awarded the 1967 International and Universal Exposition (Expo 67), whose construction he oversaw. He was also one of the key politicians responsible for National League of baseball granting Montreal a franchise, the now-defunct Montreal Expos. Another of Drapeau&#x27;s major projects was obtaining and holding the 1976 Summer Olympics.

<text>The Old World warblers are a large group of birds formerly grouped together in the bird family [[Sylviidae]]. They are not closely related to the New World warblers. The family held over 400 species in over 70 genera, and were the source of much taxonomic confusion. Two families were split out initially, the cisticolas into Cisticolidae and the kinglets into Regulidae. In the past 20–30 years they have been the subject of much research and many species are now placed into other families, including the Acrocephalidae, Cettiidae, Phylloscopidae, and Megaluridae. In addition some species have been moved into existing families or have not yet had their placement fully resolved. Only a small number of warblers, in just two genera, are now retained in the family Sylviidae.

== Characteristics ==

Most Old World warblers are of generally undistinguished appearance, though some species are boldly marked. The sexes are often identical, but may be clearly distinct, notably in the genera &quot;Sylvia&quot; and &quot;Curruca&quot;. They are of small to medium size, varying from 9 to 20 centimetres in length, with a slender, finely pointed bill. Almost all species are primarily insectivorous, although many will also eat soft fruit, nectar, or tiny seeds.

The majority of species are monogamous and build simple, cup-shaped nests in dense vegetation. They lay between two and six eggs per clutch, depending on species. Both parents typically help in raising the young, which are able to fly at around two weeks of age.

== Systematics ==

In the late 20th century, the Sylviidae were thought to unite nearly 300 small insectivorous bird species in nearly 50 genera, a huge family, with few clear patterns of relationships recognisable. Though not as diverse as the Timaliidae (Old World babblers; another &quot;wastebin taxon&quot; containing more thrush-like forms), the frontiers were much blurred. The largely tropical warbler family Cisticolidae was at that time traditionally included in the Sylviidae. The kinglets, now a small genus in a monotypic family Regulidae, were also sometimes placed in this family, including by the influential &quot;List of Recent Holarctic Bird Species&quot;. The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union then also included the gnatcatchers, as subfamily Polioptilinae, in the Sylviidae.

Sibley &amp; Ahlquist (1990) united the &quot;Old World warblers&quot; with the babblers and other taxa in a superfamily Sylvioidea as a result of DNA–DNA hybridisation studies. This demonstrated that the Sylviidae as initially defined was a form taxon which collected unrelated songbirds. Consequently, the monophyly of the individual &quot;songster&quot; lineages themselves was increasingly being questioned.

More recently, analysis of DNA sequence data has provided information on the Sylvioidea. Usually, the scope of the clade was underestimated and only one or two specimens were sampled for each presumed &quot;family&quot;. Minor or little-known groups such as the parrotbills were left out entirely (e.g. Ericson &amp; Johansson 2003, Barker &quot;et al.&quot; 2004). These could only confirm that the Cisticolidae were indeed distinct, and suggested that bulbuls (Pycnonotidae) were apparently the closest relatives of a group containing Sylviidae, Timaliidae, cisticolids and white-eyes.

In 2003, a study of Timaliidae relationships (Cibois 2003a) using mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and 12S/16S rRNA data indicated that the Sylviidae and Old World babblers were not reciprocally monophyletic to each other. Moreover, &quot;Sylvia&quot;, the type genus of the Sylviidae, turned out to be closer to taxa such as the yellow-eyed babbler (&quot;Chrysomma sinense&quot;, traditionally held to be an atypical timaliid) and the wrentit (&quot;Chamaea fasciata&quot;), an enigmatic species generally held to be the only American Old World babbler. The parrotbills Paradoxornithidae (roughly, &quot;puzzling birds&quot;) of then unclear affiliations also were part of what apparently was a well distinctive clade.

Cibois suggested that the Sylviidae should officially be suppressed by the ICZN as a taxon and the genus &quot;Sylvia&quot; merged into the Timaliidae (Cibois 2003b), but this was rejected. Clearly, the sheer extent of the groups concerned made it necessary to study a wide range of taxa. This was begun by Beresford &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) and Alström &quot;et al.&quot; (2006). They determined that the late-20th-century Sylviidae united at least four, but probably as many as seven major distinct lineages. The authors propose the creation of several new families (Phylloscopidae, Cettiidae, Acrocephalidae, and Megaluridae, this last turning out to be a synonym of the older-published Locustellidae) to better reflect the evolutionary history of the sylvioid group.

<text>Various Passeriformes (perching birds) are commonly referred to as warblers. They are not necessarily closely related to one another, but share some characteristics, such as being fairly small, vocal, and insectivorous.

== Sylvioid warblers ==
These are somewhat more closely related to each other than to other warblers. They belong to a superfamily also containing Old World babblers, bulbuls, etc.
* &quot;Old World warblers&quot;, formerly all in the family Sylviidae:
** Leaf warblers, now in the family Phylloscopidae
** Bush warblers, now in the family Cettiidae
** Grass warblers and megalurid warblers, now in the family Locustellidae
** Marsh and tree warblers, now in the family Acrocephalidae
** Sylviid warblers or typical warblers, remaining in the family Sylviidae
** Cisticolid warblers, now in the family Cisticolidae
** Malagasy warblers, now in the family Bernieridae

== Passeroid warblers ==
The two families of American warblers are part of another superfamily, which unites them with New World sparrows, buntings, finches, etc.
* &quot;New World warblers&quot;, formerly all in the family Parulidae:
** Olive warbler, in the monotypic family Peucedramidae
** New World warblers, remaining in the family Parulidae

== Others ==
* Tit-warblers or flycatcher-tits, family Stenostiridae
These are closely related to the tits and chickadees

* Australasian warblers, family Acanthizidae
These are the most distinct group of warblers. They are not closely related at all to the others, but rather to the honeyeaters and fairy-wrens.

*A handwritten message with this date purports to show a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq&#x27;s Saddam Hussein government. The letter, purportedly from the head of Iraqi Intelligence to Saddam outlines mission training which Mohammed Atta, one of the organizers of the 11 September attacks, has supposedly received in Iraq. It also claims that Hussein accepted a shipment from Niger, presumably of uranium.

11 September 2001
* In multiple terrorist attacks on the United States, al-Qaeda hijackers crash American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 into and destroy the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, and crash American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. United Airlines Flight 93, also heading for Washington, D.C. to attack the White House or the United States Capitol, crashes into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers and members of flight crew attempt to re-take control.

==2002==

===January===

29 January
* US President George W. Bush in 2002 State of the Union Address, calling Iraq a member of the axis of evil, and saying &quot;The United States of America will not permit the world&#x27;s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world&#x27;s most destructive weapons.&quot;

===February===
* The CIA sent former Ambassador Joseph Wilson to investigate the yellowcake claims with officials from Niger. Wilson met with the current US Ambassador to Niger, Barbro Owens-Kirkpatrick at the embassy and then interviewed dozens of officials who had been in the Niger government at the time of the supposed deal. He ultimately concluded: &quot;it was highly doubtful that any such transaction had ever taken place.&quot; Wilson learned that the Iraqis had in fact requested a meeting to discuss &quot;expanding commercial relations&quot; but that Niger&#x27;s Prime Minister Mayaki had declined, due to concern about U.N. sanctions against Iraq. After President Bush&#x27;s 2003 State of the Union Address included these 16 words: &quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa&quot;, ambassador Wilson wrote a critical op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which he explained the nature of the documents and the government&#x27;s prior knowledge of their unreliability for use in a case for war. Wilson described the basis for his mission to Niger as follows: &quot;The vice president&#x27;s office asked a serious question [about the truth of allegations that Iraq was seeking to purchase uranium yellowcake from Niger]. I was asked to help formulate the answer.&quot; Shortly after Wilson&#x27;s op-ed, the identity of Wilson&#x27;s wife, undercover CIA analyst Valerie Plame, was revealed in a column by Robert Novak after a conversation with Richard Armitage, leading to an investigation as to whether the revelation was retribution for Wilson going public with doubts about the yellowcake claims. It is a felony to reveal the identity of a CIA agent, yet no one has been convicted as a result of Novak&#x27;s column, though I. Lewis &#x27;Scooter&#x27; Libby, Dick Cheney&#x27;s Chief of Staff, was convicted of perjury in the Plame leak investigation.

===July===

5 July
* Iraq once again rejects new UN weapons inspection proposals.

23 July
* A British government memo gives an overview of a secret meeting of United Kingdom Labour government, defense, and intelligence figures, who discuss the build-up to war in Iraq. The head of MI6, recently back from visiting Washington, is quoted as expressing the view that &quot;Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&quot;

===August===
* According to U.S. Intelligence, China, with help from France and Syria, has secretly sold to Iraq the prohibited chemical Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, or HTPB, which is used in making solid fuel for long-range missiles. France denies that the sale took place. U.S. intelligence traces the sale back to China&#x27;s Qilu Chemicals company in Shandong province. The chemical sale involved a French company known as CIS Paris, which helped broker the sale of 20 tons of HTPB, which was then shipped from China to the Syrian port of Tartus. The chemicals were then shipped by truck from Syria to an Iraqi missile manufacturing plant.

2 August

* In a letter to the UN Secretary-General, Iraq invites Hans Blix to Iraq for discussions on remaining disarmament issues.

17 August

* A letter from an Iraqi intelligence official urgently asks agents in Iraq to look for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and another unnamed man.

19 August
* The UN Secretary-General rejects Iraq&#x27;s 2 August proposal as the &quot;wrong work program&quot;, but recommends that Iraq allow the return of weapons inspectors in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284, passed in 1999.

===September===

12 September
* Bush, addressing the UN General Assembly, challenges the UN to confront the &quot;grave and gathering danger&quot; of Iraq or stand aside as the United States and likeminded nations act. The UN Security Council begins discussion on drafting a new resolution to encourage Iraq to comply with the previous sixteen UN resolutions.

22 September
* The British government places a dossier before Parliament giving its intelligence assessment of Iraq&#x27;s WMD capability. The document alleges that Iraq possesses chemical weapons and biological weapons, and has restarted its nuclear weapons program. The document also asserts that Iraq has sought &quot;significant quantities of uranium from Africa&quot;, and that some of the WMD would be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them. Claims later leaked in May 2003 that the dossier was &quot;sexed up&quot; under pressure from Downing Street will lead to a media furore, and the apparent suicide of weapons inspector David Kelly.

26 September
* Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld accuses Iraq of harboring al Qaeda terrorists and aiding their quest for weapons of mass destruction.
* The Bush administration says attempts by Iraq to acquire thousands of high-strength aluminum tubes points to a clandestine program to make enriched uranium for nuclear bombs. Indeed, Colin Powell, in his address to the U.N. Security Council just prior to the war, made reference to the aluminum tubes. But a report released by the Institute for Science and International Security in 2002 reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium. Powell later admitted he had presented an inaccurate case to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons, and that the intelligence presented was in some cases &quot;deliberately misleading.&quot;

===October===

3 October
*US Evangelical Christian leaders led by Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention send a letter to President Bush outlining the theological justification for a pre-emptive attack on Iraq.

Colin Powell suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the U.S. In fact, Iraq had no fleet of UAVs nor any capability of putting UAVs on ships. Iraq&#x27;s UAV fleet consisted of less than a handful of outdated Czech training drones. At the time, there was a vigorous dispute within the intelligence community as to whether CIA conclusions about Iraqi UAVs were accurate. The U.S. Air Force agency most familiar with UAVs denied outright that Iraq possessed any offensive UAV capability.

===November===

8 November
* The UN Council votes unanimously for Resolution 1441, the 17th Iraq disarmament resolution passed by the council, calling for immediate and complete disarmament of Iraq.

13 November 2002
* Iraq accepts U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 and informs the UN that it will abide by the resolution.
* Weapons inspectors arrive in Baghdad again after a four-year absence.

===December===

7 December
* Iraq files a 12,000-page weapons declaration with the UN in order to meet requirements of resolution 1441. UN weapons inspectors, the UN security council and the U.S. feel that this declaration fails to account for all of Iraq&#x27;s chemical and biological agents.
*Turkey moves approximately 15,000 soldiers to the border with Iraq
19 December
* UNMOVIC Chairman Hans Blix tells UNSC members that the Iraqi weapons declaration filed on 7 December &quot;is essentially a reorganized version&quot; of information Iraq provided UNSCOM in 1997, and that it &quot;is not enough to create confidence&quot; that Iraq has abandoned its WMD efforts.

==2003==

===January===

January 2003
*Turkey invites at least five other regional countries to a &quot;&#x27;last-chance&#x27; meeting to avert a US-led war against Iraq.&quot;

January 2003
* A statement released to various newspapers and signed by the leaders of Britain, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Denmark and the Czech Republic shows support for the US, saying that Saddam should not be allowed to violate U.N. resolutions. The statement goes on to say that Saddam is a &quot;clear threat to world security,&quot; and urges Europe to unite with the United States to ensure that the Iraqi government is disarmed.
25 January 2003
* An international group of volunteers leaves London, heading for Baghdad to act as human shields. Most will leave in March fearing that they would actually become human shields.
27 January 2003
* Chairmen of the inspections effort report to the UN Security Council that, while Iraq has provided some access to facilities, concerns remain regarding undeclared material; inability to interview Iraqi scientists; inability to deploy aerial surveillance during inspections; and harassment of weapons inspectors.
31 January 2003
* Tony Blair meets George Bush at the White House. In a memo written by Blair&#x27;s chief foreign adviser, Bush is paraphrased as saying: &quot;The start date for the military campaign was now pencilled in for March 10. This was when the bombing would begin.&quot;

===February===

5 February 2003
* At the United Nations US Secretary of State Colin Powell presents the US government&#x27;s case against the Saddam Hussein government of Iraq, as part of the diplomatic side of the U.S. plan to invade Iraq. The presentation includes tape recordings, satellite photographs and other intelligence data, and aims to prove WMD production, evasion of weapons inspections and a link to Al-Qaida.
7 February 2003
* The chief United Nations arms inspector Hans Blix says Iraq appears to be making fresh efforts to cooperate with U.N. teams hunting weapons of mass destruction, while Washington says the &quot;momentum is building&quot; for war with Iraq.
8 February 2003
* Sections of a new &#x27;dossier&#x27; issued by the UK government, which purports to present the latest British intelligence about Iraq, and which has been cited by Tony Blair and Colin Powell as evidence for the need for war, are criticized as plagiarisms. Evidently they have been copied without permission from a number of sources including &quot;Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review&quot; and a 12-year-old doctoral thesis which was published in the US journal &quot;Middle East Review of International Affairs&quot;. Some sentences appear copied word-for-word with even spelling mistakes being reproduced from the original articles. Downing Street responds by saying that the government had never claimed exclusive authorship and that the information was accurate.
10 February 2003 
* France and Belgium break the NATO procedure of silent approval concerning the timing of protective measures for Turkey in case of a possible war with Iraq. Germany says it supports this veto. The procedure was put into operation on 6 February by secretary general George Robertson. In response Turkey calls upon Article 4 of the NATO Treaty, which stipulates that member states must deliberate when asked to do so by another member state if it feels threatened.
12 February 2003
* An audio tape attributed to Osama bin Laden is released by al Jazeera television. It recounts the battle of Tora Bora and urges Muslims to fight the United States and to overthrow the Iraq government of Saddam Hussein.
13 February 2003
*A UN panel reports that Iraq&#x27;s al-Samoud 2 missiles, disclosed by Iraq to weapons inspectors in December, have a range of 180 km (above the 150 km limit allowed by the UN), splitting opinion over whether they breach UNSCR 1441.
*Austria bars USA military units involved in the attack on Iraq from entering into or flying over its territories without a UN mandate to attack Iraq.
*The Washington Post claims that anonymous sources confirm that two Special Forces units have been operating on the ground inside Iraq for over a month, making preliminary preparations for a large-scale invasion.
14 February 2003
*A very large demonstration is held in Melbourne to protest against the Australian government&#x27;s support for the USA&#x27;s policy on Iraq. Organisers estimate that 200,000 people come out on to the streets, while some news sources put the number at &quot;up to 150,000&quot;.
* UNMOVIC chief weapons inspectors Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei present their second report to the United Nations Security Council. They state that the Iraqis have been co-operating well with the inspectors and that no weapons of mass destruction have been found, but that the Saddam Hussein government had still to account for many banned weapons believed to have been in his arsenal. Mr Blix also expresses doubts about some of the conclusions in Colin Powell&#x27;s Security Council presentation of 5 February, and specifically questions the significance of some of the photographic evidence that Mr Powell has presented.
15 February 2003
* Global protests against war on Iraq: People around the world demonstrate against the planning of war against Iraq. In Rome one million people take to the streets, in London one million. In Berlin there are half a million in the largest demonstration for some decades. There are also protest marches all over France as well as in many other smaller European cities. Protests are also held in South Africa, Syria, India, Russia, Canada and in the US, in around 600 cities in total.
18 February 2003
* Hours before the first ships transporting heavy United States military equipment to Turkey were supposed to reach port, the Turkish government announces that it will withhold approval to dock unless the United States increases a reciprocal $6 billion foreign aid grant to $10 billion. The Bush administration indicates that no substantial changes will be made to the proposed aid package.
22 February 2003
* Bush meets with the Spanish president, Aznar, to discuss the Security Council situation. According to a leaked transcript of the meeting, Bush was using foreign aid and trade agreements to put pressure on Security Council members to support US policy. The transcript also revealed that Saddam had offered to go into exile if he was allowed to keep $1 billion and information on weapons of mass destruction.
24 February 2003
* Secretary of State Colin Powell states at a meeting in Beijing that &quot;It is time to take action. The evidence is clear ... We are reaching that point where serious consequences must flow.&quot; His speech appears to imply that military action is likely to follow within three weeks, based on previous briefings from The Pentagon.
25 February 2003
* The United States, Britain and Spain present to the UN Security Council a much-anticipated second resolution stating that Iraq &quot;has failed to take the final opportunity&quot; to disarm, but does not include deadlines or an explicit threat of military force. Meanwhile, France, Germany, and Russia offer a counter-proposal calling for peaceful disarmament through further inspections.
* Both major parties of Kurdistan, an autonomous region in Northern Iraq, vow to fight Turkish troops if they enter Kurdistan to capture Mosul or interfere in Kurdish self-rule. Between them the two parties can mobilize up to 80,000 guerillas – most likely no match for the modern Turkish army, but a severe blow to the unity of U.S. allies on the Northern front expected in the U.S. plan to invade Iraq.
26 February 2003
* Hans Blix states that Iraq still has not made a &quot;fundamental decision&quot; to disarm, despite recent signs of increased cooperation. Specifically, Iraq has refused to destroy its al-Samoud 2 long range missiles. (These are not a WMD, and Iraq is permitted &quot;battlefield&quot; missiles. However, Iraq&#x27;s missiles were limited by UN instruction to a diameter of 600mm, and the Al-Samoud II has a diameter of 760mm). These missiles are deployed and mobile. Also, an R-400 aerial bomb was found that could possibly contain biological agents. Given this find, the UN Inspectors have requested access to the Al-Aziziyah weapons range to verify that all 155 R-400 bombs can be accounted for and proven destroyed. Blix also expresses skepticism over Iraq&#x27;s claims to have destroyed its stockpiles of anthrax and VX nerve agent in &quot;Time magazine&quot;. Blix said he found it &quot;a bit odd&quot; that Iraq, with &quot;one of the best-organized regimes in the Arab world,&quot; would claim to have no records of the destruction of these illegal substances. &quot;I don&#x27;t see that they have acquired any credibility,&quot; Blix said
* George Bush commits publicly to a post-invasion democracy in Iraq, saying it will be &quot;an example&quot; to other nations in Arabia
* Tony Blair passes a motion in the British House of Commons supporting a new resolution at the UN Security Council and presumably authorizing a war (although the motion carefully avoids saying so). 120 UK Labour Party MPs dissent and vote against it – double the number who opposed the previous such motion – but the UK Conservative Party backs the government&#x27;s motion.
* Saddam Hussein, in an interview with Dan Rather, rules out exile as an option.
27 February 2003
* UN Security Council meeting on Iraq ends without forming an agreement on timeline for further weapons inspections or future reports.
28 February 2003
* Iraq is expected to begin the process of destroying Al Samoud two missiles on Saturday. Hans Blix, U.N. chief weapons inspector says &quot;It is a very significant piece of real disarmament&quot;. However, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer declares that the Iraq commitment to destroying these missiles is a fraud that President George W. Bush had predicted, and indicates that the United States wants a total and complete disarmament of Iraq. He also repeats that if the United Nations does not act to disarm Baghdad, the United States will lead a coalition of voluntary countries to disarm Saddam Hussein.

===March===

1 March 2003
*Under UN supervision, Iraq begins destroying four of its Al Samoud missiles.
*The Turkish speaker of Parliament voids the vote accepting U.S. troops involved in the planned invasion of Iraq into Turkey on constitutional grounds. 264 votes for and 250 against accepting 62,000 US military personnel do not constitute the necessary majority under the Turkish constitution, due to 19 abstentions.
*The United Arab Emirates calls for Iraqi president Saddam Hussein to step down to avoid war. The sentiment is later echoed by Kuwait.
*Many of the &quot;human shields&quot; begin to return to their home countries because the Iraqi government actually wanted to use them as human shields. The human shields that fled the country told reporters that the Iraqi government wanted them to sit at locations (power stations) that were quite likely to be bombed, not the hospitals they&#x27;d intended to defend. (The following year, at least one hospital was razed).
2 March 2003
*The country of Bahrain becomes the third Arab country to call for Iraqi president Saddam Hussein to step down. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates had previously made similar announcements.
*&quot;The Observer&quot; publishes what it claims is a leaked memo dated 31 January 2003 ordering members of the NSA to spy on UN Security Council members, focussing especially on members from Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Mexico, Guinea, and Pakistan to try to determine how they will vote.
*Iraq destroys six more Al Samoud missiles, bringing the total destroyed to 10 out of an estimated 100 missiles ordered eliminated by the UN. The White House continues to dismiss Iraq&#x27;s actions as &quot;part of its game of deception.&quot; Iraq indicates that it may halt destruction of the missiles if the U.S. indicates it will go to war anyway.
3 March 2003
*Under intense American pressure, Turkey indicates that its Parliament will consider a second vote on whether to allow U.S. troops to use Turkish bases for a military attack on Iraq.
*Iraqi technicians use bulldozers to crush six more of the banned Al-Samoud 2 missiles, bringing to 16 the number destroyed in three days.
4 March 2003
*Iraq destroys three more Al Samoud 2 missiles, bringing to 19 the number Baghdad has crushed out of 100 ordered destroyed by the UN. Iraq also destroys a launcher and five engines in a rush to prove it is disarming before a crucial U.N. report on 7 March. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan calls the new actions &quot;a positive development&quot; while the White House remains unconvinced saying, &quot;Despite whatever limited head-fakes Iraq has engaged in, they continue to fundamentally not disarm.&quot;
5 March 2003
*Pope John Paul II calls on Catholics to commemorate Ash Wednesday by fasting and praying for peace. He sends an envoy, Cardinal Pio Laghi, to President Bush, to urge him not to go to war. Laghi tells Bush that the Pope believes that a war would be a &quot;defeat for humanity&quot; and would be neither morally nor legally justified.
* Two days before his scheduled update to the United Nations on Iraqi cooperation with inspection, Hans Blix credits Iraq with &quot;a great deal more of cooperation now&quot;, although still expressing some skepticism as to whether or not the cooperation would continue. Among the examples of cooperation that he cites are Iraq&#x27;s destruction of Samoud 2 missiles, which he calls &quot;the most spectacular and the most important and tangible&quot;. He adds that &quot;here weapons that can be used in war are being destroyed in fairly large quantities.&quot; In general, he states, &quot;you have a greater measure of cooperation on interviews in general.&quot; These statements help to harden the opposition to the US-led war by several other Security Council members. (It was later found that Blix had found and destroyed almost the only illegal weapons in Iraq – and they were not WMD).
* Secretary of State Colin Powell says that US intelligence has indicated that Hussein has ordered the production of more Al Samoud 2 missiles parts and engines. The Iraqi government does not deny the claim but simply says once again that they considered the missiles to be legal. Powell also points out that Iraq has delivered &quot;some documents that have not been found before&quot;
* Iraq destroys nine more Al Samoud 2 missiles, bringing to 28 the total number of missiles scrapped.
6 March 2003
*United States intelligence reports that the Iraqi government has ordered US military uniforms with plans of carrying out attacks on Iraqi citizens which would then be blamed on US soldiers. (Reuters)
*Iraqi exiles testify in Washington about the brutal crimes committed against Iraqi citizens by the Hussein government. One Iraqi woman says that the Iraqi people are &quot;patiently waiting&quot; for the US to liberate the country. Another woman says that war protesters are &quot;ignorant and misinformed&quot;.
* Iraq flattens six more Al Samoud 2 missiles, meaning the country has now destroyed 34 of its known stock of 100 of the banned rockets.
* China joins France, Russia, and Germany in putting itself officially on record as opposing a US-led war. Jiang Zemin is quoted as saying, &quot;The door of peace should not be closed.&quot;
* US President George W. Bush holds a live, televised press conference on the latest developments in the War on Terrorism, the situation with North Korea and the standoff with Iraq.

7 March 2003
*The Washington Times publishes a report detailing recent US intelligence showing that France has been secretly selling spare parts to Iraq for its fighter jets and military helicopters during the past several months. Other intelligence reports indicate that Iraq had succeeded in acquiring French weaponry illegally for years.
*The German newspaper &quot;Die Tageszeitung&quot; claims that at the request of the United States, the 12,000-page Iraqi weapons declaration was largely censored before being submitted to the UN, in order to remove references to Western countries that supplied arms to Iraq. Only some 3,000 pages were left after the censorship; newspaper had obtained copies of the censored report, which references such companies as Honeywell among a chief supplier of Iraqi arms. The list of American companies can be found at
*Hans Blix reports to the UN Security Council. Blix says, &quot;No evidence of proscribed activities have so far been found,&quot; saying that progress was made in inspections which would continue. Blix files a 173-page document with the Security Council which says that inspectors discovered an undeclared Iraqi drone, with a wingspan of , suggesting an illegal range beyond 150 km. US satellites tracked test flights of these drones, which were mentioned by Secretary of State Powell on 5 March. Powell claimed that the test flight far exceeded the legal range agreed to by Iraq under UN resolutions. The Iraqis showed journalists this &#x27;drone&#x27;. It was primitive, and could only be flown within &quot;line of sight&quot;. Blix was strongly criticized in some UK and US press for not having found and declared this large model aircraft.
* Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, concludes that the documents the US and Britain offered as &quot;proof&quot; that Iraq had attempted to import uranium from Niger were in fact fraudulent. This &quot;proof&quot; was a key part of the US accusation that Iraq was restarting its nuclear weapons program. ElBaradei says, &quot;Based on thorough analysis, the IAEA has concluded ... that these documents, which formed the basis for the reports of recent uranium transactions between Iraq and Niger, are in fact not authentic.&quot; He concludes, &quot;We have therefore concluded that these specific allegations are unfounded.&quot;
* International peacekeepers in Kuwait file a complaint to the UN Security Council that US Marines have been cutting holes in the fence on the UN-patrolled border between Kuwait and Iraq. Fred Eckhard, a UN spokesman who filed the complaint, says that this activity may violate the Security Council resolution that set up the zone, but adds that it was up to the UN Security Council to make a determination.
* Amendments are added to the 2003 US-British-Spanish Draft Resolution on Iraq, setting a deadline of 17 March. The draft is withheld when it becomes clear that the resolution will not pass.

9 March 2003
* Near the Iraq/Kuwait border, a dozen Iraqi soldiers attempt to surrender to British paratroopers who are testing their weapons during a routine exercise. The stunned soldiers from the 16 Air Assault Brigade inform the Iraqis that they were not firing at them, and tell them it is too early to surrender.
11 March 2003
* Iraqi fighters threaten two US U-2 surveillance planes forcing them to abort their mission and return to base. Iraqi officials describe the incident as a &quot;technical mistake&quot; by the U.N. inspectors. Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for UNMOVIC, says that Iraqi officials had been notified about the flight beforehand.
* According to Arab media, Saddam Hussein has opened training camps in Iraq for Arab volunteers willing to carry out suicide bombings against U.S. forces, if an attack on Iraq takes place.
12 March 2003
* British prime minister Tony Blair proposes an amendment to the possible 18th resolution which would call for Iraq to meet certain benchmarks to prove that it was disarming. The benchmarks include a televised speech from Hussein declaring the country&#x27;s intentions to disarm, and accounting for Iraq&#x27;s chemical weapons stockpiles and unmanned drones. France once again threatens to veto even if a majority of the council votes in favor of the resolution.

It had been known for some time that the U.S. military was communicating with Iraqi soldiers via email.
16 March 2003
* The leaders of the United States, Britain, Portugal and Spain meet at a summit in the Azores Islands. President Bush calls Monday, 17 March, the &quot;moment of truth&quot;, meaning that the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; would make its final effort to extract a resolution from the U.N. Security Council that would give Iraq an ultimatum to disarm immediately or to be disarmed by force.
* The United States advises U.N. weapons inspectors to leave Iraq.
* The United States orders all non-essential diplomats out of Kuwait, Syria, and Israel.
* Anti-Saddam Iraqi groups begin defacing and vandalising posters of the dictator all over Iraq. Demonstrations also take place in Kirkuk, where an estimated crowd of 20,000 marched on the Ba&#x27;ath party&#x27;s main administrative headquarters demanding the overthrow of Saddam&#x27;s government. Three posters of the Iraqi leader were torn to pieces and a grenade was thrown at the government building. Some reports indicate that one senior Ba&#x27;ath party official was killed in the attack.
17 March 2003

<text>The belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon) is a large, conspicuous water kingfisher, native to North America. All kingfishers are placed in one family, Alcedinidae, and recent research suggests that this should be divided into three subfamilies.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of the belted kingfisher was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He introduced the binomial name &quot;Alcedo alcyon&quot;. The current genus &quot;Megaceryle&quot; was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1848. &quot;Megaceryle&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;megas&quot;, &quot;great&quot;, and the existing genus &quot;Ceryle&quot;. The specific &quot;alcyon&quot; is Latin for &quot;kingfisher&quot;.

The &quot;Megaceryle&quot; large green kingfishers were formerly placed in &quot;Ceryle&quot; with the pied kingfisher, but the latter is closer to the &quot;Chloroceryle&quot; American green kingfishers. The belted kingfisher&#x27;s closest living relative is the ringed kingfisher (&quot;M. torquata&quot;), and these two in all probability originated from an African &quot;Megaceryle&quot; which colonized the Americas.

==Description==
The belted kingfisher is a stocky, medium-sized bird that measures between in length with a wingspan of between . This kingfisher can weigh from . The adult female averages slightly larger than the adult male.

This species has a large head with a shaggy crest. Its long, heavy bill is black with a grey
base. These features are common in many kingfisher species. This kingfisher shows reverse sexual dimorphism, with the female more brightly coloured than the male. Both sexes have a slate blue head, large white collar, a large blue band on the breast, and white underparts. The back and wings are slate blue with black feather tips with little white dots. The female features a rufous band across the upper belly that extends down the flanks. Juveniles of this species are similar to adults, but both sexes feature the rufous band on the upper belly. Juvenile males will have a rufous band that is somewhat mottled while the band on juvenile females will be much thinner than that of adult females.

==Distribution and habitat==
The only kingfisher in the majority of its range, the belted kingfisher&#x27;s breeding habitat is near inland bodies of waters or coasts across most of North America, within Canada, Alaska and the United States. They migrate from the northern parts of its range to the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies in winter. It is a rare visitor to the northern areas of Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas. During migration it may stray far from land; the species is recorded as an accidental visitor on several Pacific islands, such as Cocos Island, Malpelo Island, Hawaii, the Azores, Clarion Island, and has occurred as an extremely rare vagrant in Ecuador, Greenland, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. The southernmost records of &quot;M. alcyon&quot; are from the Galapagos Archipelago, insular Ecuador, where it occurs as a migrant in small numbers but apparently not every year.

It leaves northern parts of its range when the water freezes; in warmer areas, it is a permanent resident. A few individuals may linger in the north even in the coldest winters except in the Arctic, if there are remaining open bodies of water.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The belted kingfisher is often seen perched prominently on trees, posts, or other suitable watchpoints close to water before plunging in headfirst after its fish prey. They also eat amphibians, molluscs, small crustaceans, insects, small mammals, small birds, reptiles and berries.

As the kingfisher flies about its habitat, it frequently emits a characteristic rattling call. Accordingly, a small group of belted kingfishers is known as a rattle, concentration, or kerfuffle.

This bird nests in a horizontal tunnel made in a river bank or sand bank and excavated by both parents. The female lays five to eight eggs and both adults share the task of incubating the eggs and feeding the young. During the breeding season, males may also exhibit a strong degree of territoriality in the immediate vicinity of their nest, chasing away conspecifics and predators alike.

The nest of the belted kingfisher is a long tunnel and often slopes uphill. One possible reason for the uphill slope is that, in case of flooding, the chicks will be able to survive in the air pocket formed by the elevated end of the tunnel.

<text>Liliʻuokalani (; Lydia Liliʻu Loloku Walania Kamakaʻeha; September 2, 1838 – November 11, 1917) was the only queen regnant and the last sovereign monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom, ruling from January 29, 1891, until the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom on January 17, 1893. The composer of &quot;Aloha ʻOe&quot; and numerous other works, she wrote her autobiography &quot;Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Story by Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Queen&quot; (1898) during her imprisonment following the overthrow.

Liliʻuokalani was born in 1838 in Honolulu, on the island of Oʻahu. While her natural parents were Analea Keohokālole and Caesar Kapaʻakea, she was &quot;hānai&quot; (informally adopted) at birth by Abner Pākī and Laura Kōnia and raised with their daughter Bernice Pauahi Bishop. Baptized as a Christian and educated at the Royal School, she and her siblings and cousins were proclaimed eligible for the throne by King Kamehameha III. She was married to American-born John Owen Dominis, who later became the Governor of Oʻahu. The couple had no biological children but adopted several. After the accession of her brother David Kalākaua to the throne in 1874, she and her siblings were given Western-style titles of Prince and Princess. In 1877, after her younger brother Leleiohoku II&#x27;s death, she was proclaimed as heir apparent to the throne. During the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria, she represented her brother as an official envoy to the United Kingdom.

Liliʻuokalani ascended to the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother&#x27;s death. During her reign, she attempted to draft a new constitution which would restore the power of the monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaiʻi overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.

The coup d&#x27;état established a Provisional Government which became the Republic of Hawaiʻi, but the ultimate goal was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was temporarily blocked by President Grover Cleveland. After an unsuccessful uprising to restore the monarchy, the oligarchical government placed the former queen under house arrest at the ʻIolani Palace. On January 24, 1895, under threat of execution of her imprisoned supporters, Liliʻuokalani was forced to abdicate the Hawaiian throne, officially resigning as head of the deposed monarchy. Attempts were made to restore the monarchy and oppose annexation, but with the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, the United States annexed Hawaiʻi. Living out the remainder of her later life as a private citizen, Liliʻuokalani died at her residence, Washington Place, in Honolulu in 1917.

== Early life ==
Liliʻuokalani was born Lydia Liliʻu Loloku Walania Kamakaʻeha on September 2, 1838, to Analea Keohokālole and Caesar Kapaʻakea. She was born in the large grass hut of her maternal grandfather, ʻAikanaka, at the base of Punchbowl Crater in Honolulu on the island of Oʻahu. According to Hawaiian custom, she was named after an event linked to her birth. At the time she was born, &quot;Kuhina Nui&quot; (regent) Elizabeth Kīnaʻu had developed an eye infection. She named the child using the words; &quot;liliʻu&quot; (smarting), &quot;loloku&quot; (tearful), &quot;walania&quot; (a burning pain) and &quot;kamakaʻeha&quot; (sore eyes). According to the journals of American missionary Levi Chamberlain, she was baptized on December 23, and given the Christian name Lydia.
Her family were of the aliʻi class of the Hawaiian nobility and were collateral relations of the reigning House of Kamehameha, sharing common descent from the 18th-century &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; (supreme monarch) Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. From her biological parents, she descended from Keaweaheulu and Kameʻeiamoku, two of the five royal counselors of Kamehameha I during his conquest of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Kameʻeiamoku, the grandfather of both her mother and father, was depicted, along with his royal twin Kamanawa, on the Hawaiian coat of arms. Liliʻuokalani referred to her family line as the &quot;Keawe-a-Heulu line&quot; after her mother&#x27;s line. The third surviving child of a large family, her biological siblings included: James Kaliokalani, David Kalākaua, Anna Kaʻiulani, Kaʻiminaʻauao, Miriam Likelike and William Pitt Leleiohoku II. She and her siblings were &quot;hānai&quot; (informally adopted) to other family members. The Hawaiian custom of &quot;hānai&quot; is an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. She was given at birth to Abner Pākī and his wife Laura Kōnia and raised with their daughter Bernice Pauahi.

In 1842, at the age of four, she began her education at the Chiefs&#x27; Children&#x27;s School (later known as the Royal School). She, along with her classmates, had been formally proclaimed by Kamehameha III as eligible for the throne of the Hawaiian Kingdom. Liliʻuokalani later noted that these &quot;pupils were exclusively persons whose claims to the throne were acknowledged.&quot; She, along with her two older brothers James Kaliokalani and David Kalākaua, as well as her thirteen royal cousins, were taught in English by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife, Juliette Montague Cooke. The children were taught reading, spelling, penmanship, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, physics, geography, history, bookkeeping, music and English composition by the missionary couple who had to maintain the moral and sexual development of their charges. Liliʻuokalani was placed with the youngest pupils of the class along with Princess Victoria Kamāmalu, Mary Polly Paʻaʻāina, and John William Pitt Kīnaʻu. In later life, Liliʻuokalani would look back unfavorably on her early education remembering being &quot;sent hungry to bed&quot; and the 1848 measles epidemic that claimed the life of a classmate Moses Kekūāiwa and her younger sister Kaʻiminaʻauao. The boarding school run by the Cookes was discontinued around 1850, so she, along with her former classmate Victoria, was sent to the relocated day school (also called Royal School) run by Reverend Edward G. Beckwith. On May 5, 1853, she finished third in her final class exams behind Victoria and Nancy Sumner. In 1865, after her marriage, she informally attended Oahu College (modern day Punahou School) and received instruction under Susan Tolman Mills, who later cofounded Mills College in California.

== Courtship and married life ==

After the boarding school was discontinued in 1850, Liliʻuokalani lived with her &quot;hānai&quot; parents at Haleʻākala, which she referred to in later life as her childhood home. Around this time, her &quot;hānai&quot; sister Pauahi married the American Charles Reed Bishop against the wishes of their parents but reconciled with them shortly before Pākī&#x27;s death in 1855. Kōnia died two years afterward and Liliʻuokalani came under the Bishops&#x27; guardianship. During this period, Liliʻuokalani became a part of the young social elite under the reign of Kamehameha IV who ascended to the throne in 1855. In 1856, Kamehameha IV announced his intent to marry Emma Rooke, one of their classmates. However, according to Liliʻuokalani, certain elements of the court argued &quot;there is no other chief equal to you in birth and rank but the adopted daughter of Paki,&quot; which infuriated the King and brought the Queen to tears. Despite this upset, Liliʻuokalani was regarded as a close friend of the new Queen, and she served as a maid of honor during the royal wedding alongside Princess Victoria Kamāmalu and Mary Pitman. At official state occasions, she served as an attendant and lady-in-waiting in Queen Emma&#x27;s retinue. Visiting British dignitaries Lady Franklin and her niece Sophia Cracroft noted in 1861 that the &quot;Honble. Lydia Paki&quot; was &quot;the highest unmarried woman in the Kingdom&quot;.

Marriage consideration had begun early on for her. American merchant Gorham D. Gilman, a houseguest of the Pākīs, had courted her unsuccessfully when she was fifteen. Around the time of Kōnia&#x27;s final illness in 1857, Liliʻuokalani was briefly engaged to William Charles Lunalilo. They shared an interest in music composition and had known each other from childhood. He had been betrothed from birth to Princess Victoria, the king&#x27;s sister, but disagreements with her brothers prevented the marriage from materializing. Thus, Lunalilo proposed to Liliʻuokalani during a trip to Lahaina to be with Kōnia. A short-lived dual engagement occurred in which Liliʻuokalani was matched to Lunalilo and her brother Kalakaua to Princess Victoria. She ultimately broke off the engagement because of the urging of King Kamehameha IV and the opposition of the Bishops to the union. Afterward, she became romantically involved with the American-born John Owen Dominis, a staff member for Prince Lot Kapuāiwa (the future Kamehameha V) and secretary to King Kamehameha IV. Dominis was the son of Captain John Dominis, of Trieste, and Mary Lambert Jones, of Boston. According to Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s memoir, they had known each other from childhood when he watched the royal children from a school next to the Cookes&#x27;. During a court excursion, Dominis escorted her home despite falling from his horse and breaking his leg.
From 1860 to 1862, Liliʻuokalani and Dominis were engaged with the wedding set on her twenty-fourth birthday. This was postponed to September 16, 1862, out of respect for the death of Prince Albert Kamehameha, son of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. The wedding was held at Haleʻākala, the residence of the Bishops. The ceremony was officiated by Reverend Samuel Chenery Damon in the Anglican rites. Her bridemaids were her former classmates Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau and Martha Swinton. King Kamehameha IV and other members of the royal family were honored guests. The couple moved into the Dominises&#x27; residence, Washington Place in Honolulu. Through his wife and connections with the king, Dominis would later become Governor of Oʻahu and Maui. The union was reportedly an unhappy one with much gossip about Dominis&#x27; infidelities and domestic strife between Liliʻuokalani and Dominis&#x27; mother Mary who disapproved of the marriage of her son with a Hawaiian. They never had any children of their own, but, against the wish of her husband and brother, Liliʻuokalani adopted three &quot;hānai&quot; children: Lydia Kaʻonohiponiponiokalani Aholo, the daughter of a family friend; Joseph Kaiponohea ʻAeʻa, the son of a retainer; and John ʻAimoku Dominis, her husband&#x27;s son.

After her marriage, she retained her position in the court circle of Kamehameha IV and later his brother and successor Kamehameha V. She assisted Queen Emma and King Kamehameha IV in raising funds to build The Queen&#x27;s Hospital. In 1864, she and Pauahi helped Princess Victoria establish the Kaʻahumanu Society, a female-led organization aimed at the relief of the elderly and the ill. At the request of Kamehameha V, she composed &quot;He Mele Lāhui Hawaiʻi&quot; in 1866 as the new Hawaiian national anthem. This was in use until replaced by her brother&#x27;s composition &quot;Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī&quot;. During the 1869 visit of Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and the &quot;Galatea&quot;, she entertained the British prince with a traditional Hawaiian luau at her Waikiki residence of Hamohamo.

== Heir apparent and regency ==

=== Elections of 1874 ===
When Kamehameha V died in 1872 with no heir, the 1864 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom called for the legislature to elect the next monarch. Following a non-binding referendum and subsequent unanimous vote in the legislature, Lunalilo became the first elected king of Hawaii. Lunalilo died without an heir in 1874. In the election that followed, Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s brother, David Kalākaua, ran against Emma, the dowager queen of Kamehameha IV. The choice of Kalākaua by the legislature, and the subsequent announcement, caused a riot at the courthouse. US and British troops were landed, and some of Emma&#x27;s supporters were arrested. The results of the election strained the relationship between Emma and the Kalākaua family.

After his accession, Kalākaua gave royal titles and styles to his surviving siblings, his sisters, Princess Lydia Kamakaʻeha Dominis and Princess Miriam Likelike Cleghorn, as well as his brother William Pitt Leleiohoku, whom he named heir to the Hawaiian throne as Kalākaua and Queen Kapiʻolani had no children of their own. Leleiohoku died without an heir in 1877. Leleiohoku&#x27;s &quot;hānai&quot; (adoptive) mother, Ruth Keʻelikōlani, wanted to be named heir, but the king&#x27;s cabinet ministers objected as that would place Bernice Pauahi Bishop, Ruth&#x27;s first cousin, next in line. This would put the Kamehamehas back in succession to the throne again, which Kalākaua did not wish. On top of that, Kalākaua&#x27;s court genealogists had already cast doubt on Ruth&#x27;s direct lineage, and in doing so placed doubt on Bernice&#x27;s. At noon on April 10, Liliʻuokalani became the newly designated heir apparent to the throne of Hawaii. It was at this time that Kalākaua had her name changed to &quot;Liliʻuokalani&quot; (the &quot; of the royal ones&quot;), replacing her given name of Liliʻu and her baptismal name of Lydia. In 1878, Liliʻuokalani and Dominis sailed to California for her health. They stayed in San Francisco and Sacramento where she visited the Crocker Art Museum.

=== First regency ===
During Kalākaua&#x27;s 1881 world tour, Liliʻuokalani served as Regent in his absence. One of her first responsibilities was handling the smallpox epidemic of 1881 likely brought to the islands by Chinese contracted laborers. After meeting her with her brother&#x27;s cabinet ministers, she closed all the ports, halted all passenger vessels out of Oʻahu, and initiated a quarantine of the affected. The measures kept the disease contained in Honolulu and Oʻahu with only a few cases on Kauaʻi. The disease mainly affected Native Hawaiians with the total number of cases at 789 with 289 fatalities, or a little over thirty-six percent.

It was during this regency that Liliʻuokalani visited the Kalaupapa Leper Settlement on Molokaʻi in September. She was too overcome to speak and John Makini Kapena, one of her brother&#x27;s ministers, had to address the people on her behalf. After the visit, in the name of her brother, Liliʻuokalani made Father Damien a knight commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua for his service to her subjects. She also convinced the governmental board of health to set aside land for a leprosy hospital at Kakaʻako. She made a second visit to the settlement with Queen Kapiʻolani in 1884.

Liliʻuokalani was active in philanthropy and the welfare of her people. In 1886, she founded a bank for women in Honolulu named Liliuokalani&#x27;s Savings Bank and helped Isabella Chamberlain Lyman establish Kumukanawai o ka Liliuokalani Hui Hookuonoono, a money lending group for women in Hilo. In the same year, she also founded the Liliʻuokalani Educational Society, an organization &quot;to interest the Hawaiian ladies in the proper training of young girls of their own race whose parents would be unable to give them advantages by which they would be prepared for the duties of life.&quot; It supported the tuition of Hawaiian girls at Kawaiahaʻo Seminary for Girls, where her hānai daughter Lydia Aholo attended, and Kamehameha School.

=== Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria ===
In April 1887, Kalākaua sent a delegation to attend the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in London. It included his wife Queen Kapiʻolani, the Princess Liliʻuokalani and her husband, as well as Court Chamberlain Colonel Curtis P. Iaukea acting as the official envoy of the King and Colonel James Harbottle Boyd acting as aide-de-camp to the Queen. The party landed in San Francisco and traveled across the United States visiting Washington, D.C., Boston and New York City, where they boarded a ship for the United Kingdom. While in the American capital, they were received by President Grover Cleveland and his wife Frances Cleveland. In London, Kapiʻolani and Liliʻuokalani received an official audience with Queen Victoria at Buckingham Palace. Queen Victoria greeted both Hawaiian royals with affection, and recalled Kalākaua&#x27;s visit in 1881. They attended the special Jubilee service at Westminster Abbey and were seated with other foreign royal guests, and with members of the Royal Household. Shortly after the Jubilee celebrations, they learned of the Bayonet Constitution that Kalākaua had been forced to sign under the threat of death. They canceled their tour of Europe and returned to Hawaii.

Liliʻuokalani was approached on December 20 and 23 by James I. Dowsett, Jr. and William R. Castle, members of the legislature&#x27;s Reform (Missionary) Party, proposing her ascension to the throne if her brother Kalākaua were removed from power. Historian Ralph S. Kuykendall stated that she gave a conditional &quot;if necessary&quot; response; however, Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s account was that she firmly turned down both men. In 1889, a part Native Hawaiian officer Robert W Wilcox, who resided in Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s Palama residence, instigated an unsuccessful rebellion to overthrow the Bayonet Constitution.

=== Second regency and death of Kalākaua ===
Kalākaua arrived in California aboard the USS &quot;Charleston&quot; on November 25, 1890. There was uncertainty as to the purpose of the king&#x27;s trip. Minister of Foreign Affairs John Adams Cummins reported that the trip was solely for the king&#x27;s health and would not extend beyond California, while local newspapers and the British commissioner James Hay Wodehouse speculated that the king might go further east to Washington, D.C., to negotiate a treaty to extend the existing exclusive US access rights to Pearl Harbor, or the annexation of the kingdom. The McKinley Tariff Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian duty-free advantage under the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875. After failing to persuade the king to stay, Liliʻuokalani wrote that he and Hawaiian ambassador to the United States Henry A. P. Carter planned to discuss the tariff situation in Washington. In his absence, Liliʻuokalani was left in charge as regent for the second time. In her memoir, she wrote that &quot;Nothing worthy of record transpired during the closing days of 1890, and the opening weeks of 1891.&quot;

Upon arriving in California, Kalākaua, whose health had been declining, stayed in a suite at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. Traveling throughout Southern California and Northern Mexico, the monarch suffered a stroke in Santa Barbara and was rushed back to San Francisco. Kalākaua fell into a coma in his suite on January 18, and died two days later on January 20. The official cause of death was &quot;Bright&#x27;s disease with Uremic Blood Poisoning.&quot; The news of Kalākaua&#x27;s death did not reach Hawaii until January 29 when the &quot;Charleston&quot; returned to Honolulu with the remains of the king.

== Reign ==
On January 29, 1891, in the presence of the cabinet ministers and the supreme court justices, Liliʻuokalani took the oath of office to uphold the constitution, and became the first and only female monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom. The first few weeks of her reign were obscured by the funeral of her brother. After the end of the period of mourning, one of her first acts was to request the formal resignation of the holdover cabinet from her brother&#x27;s reign. These ministers refused, and asked for a ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court. All the justices but one ruled in favor of the Queen&#x27;s decision, and the ministers resigned. Liliʻuokalani appointed Samuel Parker, Hermann A. Widemann, and William A. Whiting, and reappointed Charles N. Spencer (from the hold-over cabinet), as her new cabinet ministers. On March 9, with the approval of the House of Nobles, as required by the Hawaiian constitution, she named as successor her niece Kaʻiulani, the only daughter of Archibald Scott Cleghorn and her sister Princess Likelike, who had died in 1887. From April to July, Liliʻuokalani paid the customary visits to the main Hawaiian Islands, including a third visit to the leper settlement at Kalaupapa. Historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall noted, &quot;Everywhere she was accorded the homage traditionally paid by the Hawaiian people to their &quot;alii&quot;.&quot;
Following her accession, John Owen Dominis was given the title Prince Consort and restored to the Governorship of Oʻahu, which had been abolished following the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Dominis&#x27; death on August 27, seven months into her reign, greatly affected the new Queen. Liliʻuokalani later wrote: &quot;His death occurred at a time when his long experience in public life, his amiable qualities, and his universal popularity, would have made him an adviser to me for whom no substitute could possibly be found. I have often said that it pleased the Almighty Ruler of nations to take him away from me at precisely the time when I felt that I most needed his counsel and companionship.&quot; Cleghorn, her sister&#x27;s widower, was appointed to succeed Dominis as Governor of Oʻahu. In 1892, Liliʻuokalani would also restore the positions of governor for the other three main islands for her friends and supporters.

From May 1892 to January 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historians such as Albertine Loomis and Helena G. Allen dubbed the &quot;Longest Legislature&quot;. This session was dominated by political infighting between and within the four parties: National Reform, Reform, National Liberal and Independent; none were able to gain a majority. Debates heard on the floor of the houses concerned the popular demand for a new constitution and the passage of a lottery bill and an opium licensing bill, aimed at alleviating the economic crisis caused by the McKinley Tariff. The main issues of contention between the new monarch and the legislators were the retention of her cabinet ministers, since political division prevented Liliʻuokalani from appointing a balanced council and the 1887 constitution gave the legislature the power to vote for the dismissal of her cabinet. Seven resolutions of want of confidence were introduced during this session, and four of her self-appointed cabinets (the Widemann, Macfarlane, Cornwell, and Wilcox cabinets) were ousted by votes of the legislature. On January 13, 1893, after the legislature dismissed the George Norton Wilcox cabinet (which had political sympathies to the Reform Party), Liliʻuokalani appointed the new Parker cabinet consisting of Samuel Parker, as minister of foreign affairs; John F. Colburn, as minister of the interior; William H. Cornwell, as minister of finance; and Arthur P. Peterson, as attorney general. She chose these men specifically to support her plan of promulgating a new constitution while the legislature was not in session.

=== Promulgating a new constitution ===

The precipitating event leading to the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was the attempt by Queen Liliʻuokalani to promulgate a new constitution to regain powers for the monarchy and Native Hawaiians that had been lost under the Bayonet Constitution. Her opponents, who were led by two Hawaiian citizens Lorrin A. Thurston and W. O. Smith and included six Hawaiian citizens, five US citizens and one German citizen, were outraged by her attempt to promulgate a new constitution and moved to depose the Queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii&#x27;s annexation to the United States.

Shortly after her accession, Liliʻuokalani began to receive petitions to re-write the Bayonet Constitution through the two major political parties of the time, Hui Kālaiʻāina and the National Reform Party. Supported by two-thirds of the registered voters, she moved to abrogate the existing 1887 constitution, but her cabinet withheld their support, knowing what her opponents&#x27; likely response would be.

The proposed constitution (co-written by the Queen and two legislators, Joseph Nāwahī and William Pūnohu White) would have restored the power to the monarchy, and voting rights to economically disenfranchised native Hawaiians and Asians. Her ministers and closest friends were all opposed to this plan; they tried unsuccessfully to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis.

=== Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom ===
The political fallout led to citywide political rallies and meetings in Honolulu. Anti-monarchists, annexationists, and leading Reform Party politicians that included Lorrin A. Thurston, a grandson of American missionaries, and Kalākaua&#x27;s former cabinet ministers under the Bayonet Constitution, formed the Committee of Safety in protest of the &quot;revolutionary&quot; action of the queen and conspired to depose her. Thurston and the Committee of Safety derived their support primarily from the American and European business class residing in Hawaiʻi. Most of the leaders of the overthrow were American and European citizens who were also Kingdom subjects. They also included legislators, government officers, and a justice of the Hawaiian Supreme Court.

In response, royalists and loyalists formed the Committee of Law and Order and met at the palace square on January 16, 1893. Nāwahī, White, Robert W. Wilcox, and other pro-monarchist leaders gave speeches in support for the queen and the government. To try to appease the instigators, the queen and her supporters abandoned attempts to unilaterally promulgate a constitution .

The same day, the Marshal of the Kingdom, Charles Burnett Wilson, was tipped off by detectives to the imminent planned coup. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member council of the Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties to United States Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied by the queen&#x27;s cabinet, who feared that the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston, Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and captain of the Royal Household Guard Samuel Nowlein had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the queen. Marines from the USS &quot;Boston&quot; and two companies of US sailors landed and took up positions at the US Legation, the Consulate, and Arion Hall. The sailors and Marines did not enter the palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, &quot;the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself&quot;.

The queen was deposed on January 17, and the provisional government established under pro-annexation leader Sanford B. Dole was officially recognized by Stevens as the &quot;de facto&quot; government. She temporarily relinquished her throne to the United States, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would restore Hawaii&#x27;s sovereignty to the rightful holder. The government under Dole began using ʻIolani Palace as its executive building. A delegation departed for Washington, D.C., on January 19, to ask for immediate annexation by the United States. At the request of the provisional government, Stevens proclaimed Hawaii a protectorate of the United States on February 1, to temporarily provide a buffer against domestic upheaval and interference by foreign governments. The US flag was raised over the palace, and martial law was enforced. The annexation treaty presented to the US Senate contained a provision to grant Liliʻuokalani a $20,000 per annum lifetime pension, and Kaʻiulani a lump-sum payment of $150,000. The queen protested the proposed annexation in a January 19 letter to President Benjamin Harrison. She sent Prince David Kawānanakoa and Paul Neumann to represent her.

Neumann delivered a letter from the queen to Grover Cleveland, who began his second non-consecutive term as president on March 4. The Cleveland administration commissioned James Henderson Blount to investigate the overthrow. He interviewed those involved in the coup and wrote the Blount Report, and based on its findings, concluded that the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani was illegal, and that Stevens and American military troops had acted inappropriately in support of those who carried out the overthrow. On November 16, Cleveland sent his minister Albert S. Willis to propose a return of the throne to Liliʻuokalani if she granted amnesty to everyone responsible. Her first response was that Hawaiian law called for property confiscation and the death penalty for treason, and that only her cabinet ministers could put aside the law in favor of amnesty. Liliuokalani&#x27;s extreme position lost her the goodwill of the Cleveland administration.

Cleveland sent the issue to the Congress, stating, &quot;The Provisional Government has not assumed a republican, or other constitutional form, but has remained a mere executive council, or oligarchy, without the consent of the people&quot;. The queen changed her position on the issue of amnesty, and on December 18, Willis demanded the provisional government reinstate her to the throne, but was refused. Congress responded with a US Senate investigation that resulted in the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894. It found Stevens and all parties except the queen &quot;not guilty&quot;, absolving them of responsibility for the overthrow. The provisional government formed the Republic of Hawaii on July 4 with Dole as its president, maintaining oligarchical control and a limited system of suffrage.

== Arrest and imprisonment ==

At the beginning of January 1895, Robert W. Wilcox and Samuel Nowlein launched a rebellion against the forces of the Republic with the aim of restoring the queen and the monarchy. Its ultimate failure led to the arrest of many of the participants and other sympathizers of the monarchy. Liliʻuokalani was also arrested and imprisoned in an upstairs bedroom at the palace on January 16, several days after the failed rebellion, when firearms were found at her home of Washington Place after a tip from a prisoner.

During her imprisonment, she abdicated her throne in return for the release (and commutation of the death sentences) of her jailed supporters; six had been sentenced to be hanged including Wilcox and Nowlein. She signed the document of abdication on January 24. In 1898, Liliʻuokalani wrote:

She was tried by the military commission of the Republic led by her former attorney general Whiting in the palace throne room on February 8. Defended at trial by another one of her former attorneys general Paul Neumann, she claimed ignorance but was sentenced to five years of hard labor in prison by the military tribunal and fined $5,000. The sentence was commuted on September 4, to imprisonment in the palace, attended by her lady-in-waiting Eveline Townsend Wilson (aka Kitty), wife of Marshal Wilson.

While in confinement she composed songs such as &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (&quot;Ke Aloha o Ka Haku&quot; – &quot;The Grace of the Lord&quot;). She also worked with her companions to create a crazy quilt which would come to be known as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Quilt&quot; or &quot;Imprisonment Quilt,&quot; featuring words, images, and symbols to represent the history of Hawai&#x27;i and hopes for its future.

On October 13, 1896, the Republic of Hawaii gave her a full pardon and restored her civil rights. &quot;Upon receiving my full release, I felt greatly inclined to go abroad,&quot; Liliʻuokalani wrote in her memoir. From December 1896 through January 1897, she stayed in Brookline, Massachusetts, with her husband&#x27;s cousins William Lee and Sara White Lee, of the Lee &amp; Shepard publishing house. During this period her long-time friend Julius A. Palmer Jr. became her secretary and stenographer, helping to write every letter, note, or publication. He was her literary support in the 1897 publication of the Kumulipo translation, and helped her in compiling a book of her songs. He assisted her as she wrote her memoir &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Story by Hawaii&#x27;s Queen&quot;. Sara Lee edited the book published in 1898 by Lee &amp; Shepard.

== Annexation ==

At the end of her visit in Massachusetts, Liliʻuokalani began to divide her time between Hawaii and Washington, D.C., where she worked to seek indemnity from the United States.

She attended the inauguration of US President William McKinley on March 4, 1897, with a Republic of Hawaii passport personally issued to &quot;Liliuokalani of Hawaii&quot; by the republic&#x27;s president Sanford B. Dole. On June 16, McKinley presented the United States Senate with a new version of the annexation treaty, one that eliminated the monetary compensation for Liliʻuokalani and Kaʻiulani. Liliʻuokalani filed an official protest with Secretary of State John Sherman the next day. The protest was witnessed by her agent and private secretary Joseph Heleluhe, Wekeki Heleluhe, and Captain Julius A. Palmer Jr., reported to be her American secretary.

In June 1897 President McKinley signed the &quot;Treaty for the Annexation for the Hawaiian Islands&quot;, but it failed to pass in the United States Senate after the Kūʻē Petitions were submitted by a commission of Native Hawaiian delegates consisting of James Keauiluna Kaulia, David Kalauokalani, William Auld, and John Richardson. Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because those signatures were also asking for restoration of the Queen. The petitions collectively were presented as evidence of the strong grassroots opposition of the Hawaiian community to annexation, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate— however, following its failure, Hawaii was annexed anyway via the Newlands Resolution, a joint resolution of Congress, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War. 

The annexation ceremony was held on August 12, 1898, at ʻIolani Palace, now being used as the executive building of the government. President Sanford B. Dole handed over &quot;the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands&quot; to United States Minister Harold M. Sewall. The flag of the Republic of Hawaii was lowered and the flag of the United States was raised in its place. Liliʻuokalani and her family members and retainers boycotted the event and shuttered themselves away at Washington Place. Many Native Hawaiians and royalists followed suit and refused to attend the ceremony.

== Crown Lands of Hawaii ==
Prior to the 1848 division of land known as the Great Māhele, during the reign of Kamehameha III, all land in Hawaii was owned by the monarchy. The Great Māhele subdivided the land among the monarchy, the government, and private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for the monarchy became known as the Crown Lands of Hawaii. When Hawaii was annexed, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her power of attorney in 1898 as part of her legal defense team in seeking indemnity for the government&#x27;s seizure of the Crown Lands. She filed a protest with the United States Senate on December 20, 1898, requesting their return and claiming the lands were seized without due process or recompense.

On April 30, 1900, the US Congress passed the Hawaii Organic Act establishing a government for the Territory of Hawaii. The territorial government took control of the Crown Lands, which became the source of the &quot;Ceded Lands&quot; issue in Hawaii. The &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; reported on May 31 that Macfarlane had informed them the Queen had exhausted her patience with Congress and intended to file a lawsuit against the government. Former United States Minister to Hawaii Edward M. McCook said he believed that once President McKinley began his second term on March 1, 1901, that the government would negotiate a generous settlement with Liliʻuokalani.

During a 1900 Congressional deadlock, she departed for Honolulu with her Washington, D.C., physician Charles H. English (sometimes referred to as John H. English). Newspapers speculated that the Queen, having been diagnosed with cancer, was going home to die. Historian Helena G. Allen made the case that English intended to gain title to crown lands for himself. According to Allen, the Queen balked at his draft of a settlement letter to Senator George Frisbie Hoar that he wanted her to copy in her handwriting and sign. The doctor was terminated &quot;without cause&quot; a month after her return and sued her.

The &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; lamented in 1903, &quot;There is something pathetic in the appearance of Queen Liliuokalani as a waiting claimant before Congress.&quot; It detailed her years-long residencies in the nation&#x27;s capital seeking indemnity, while legislators offered empty promises, but nothing of substance.

=== &quot;Liliʻuokalani v. the United States&quot; ===
In 1909, Liliʻuokalani brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against the United States under the Fifth Amendment seeking the return of the Hawaiian Crown Lands. The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her. In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands were not necessarily the private possession of the monarch in the strictest sense of the term.

== Later life and death ==
Although Liliʻuokalani was never successful in more than a decade of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a lifetime pension of $1,250 a month by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that the grant never addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself, and the figure was greatly reduced from what she had requested for recompense.

In April 1917, Liliʻuokalani raised the American flag at Washington Place in honor of five Hawaiian sailors who had perished in the sinking of the SS &quot;Aztec&quot; by German U-boats. Her act was interpreted by many as her symbolic support of the United States. Subsequent historians have disputed the true meaning of her act; Neil Thomas Proto argued that &quot;her gesture that day was intended to reflect the dignity with which she still held the right of her people to choose their own fate long after she was gone&quot;.

By the end of that summer, the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; reported that she was too frail to hold her birthday reception for the public, an annual tradition dating back to the days of the monarchy. As one of her last public appearances in September, she officially became a member of the American Red Cross. Following several months of deteriorating health that left her without the use of her lower limbs, as well as a diminished mental capacity rendering her incapable of recognizing her own house, her inner circle of friends and caregivers sat vigil for the last two weeks of her life knowing the end was near. In accordance with Hawaiian tradition, the royal &quot;kāhili&quot; fanned her as she lay in bed. On the morning of November 11, Liliʻuokalani died at the age of seventy-nine at her residence at Washington Place.

The bells of Saint Andrew Cathedral and Kawaiahaʻo Church announced her death, tolling 79 times to signify her age. In keeping with Hawaiian tradition regarding deceased royalty, her body was not removed from her home until nearly midnight. Her body lay in state at Kawaiahaʻo Church for public viewing, after which she received a state funeral in the throne room of Iolani Palace, on November 18. Composer Charles E. King led a youth choir in &quot;Aloha ʻOe&quot; as her catafalque was moved from the palace up Nuuanu Avenue with 1,200-foot ropes pulled by 200 people, for entombment with her family members in the Kalākaua Crypt at the Royal Mausoleum of Mauna ʻAla. The song was picked up by the procession participants and the crowds of people along the route. Films were taken of the funeral procession and later stored at ʻĀinahau, the former residence of her sister and niece. A fire on August 1, 1921, destroyed the home and all its contents, including the footage of the Queen&#x27;s funeral.

== Religious beliefs ==
Educated by American Protestant missionaries from a young age, Liliʻuokalani became a devout Christian and adherent to the principles of Christianity. These missionaries were largely of Congregationalist and Presbyterian extractions, subscribing to Calvinist theology, and Liliʻuokalani considered herself a &quot;regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship&quot;. She was the first member of the royal family to consistently and regularly attend service at Kawaiahaʻo Church since King Kamehameha IV converted to Anglicanism. On Sundays, she played the organ and led the choir at Kawaiahaʻo. She also regularly attended service at Kaumakapili Church and held a special interest in the Liliʻuokalani Protestant Church, to which she donated the Queen Liliʻuokalani Clock in 1892.

Historian Helena G. Allen noted that Liliʻuokalani and Kalākaua &quot;believed all religions had their &#x27;rights&#x27; and were entitled to equal treatment and opportunities&quot;. Throughout her life, Liliʻuokalani showed a broad interest in the different Christian faiths including Catholicism, Mormonism, Episcopalianism and other Protestant denominations. In 1896, she became a regular member of the Hawaiian Congregation at St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral associated with the Reformed Catholic (Anglican/Episcopal) Church of Hawaii, which King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma had founded. During the overthrow and her imprisonment, Bishop Alfred Willis of St. Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral had openly supported the Queen while Reverend Henry Hodges Parker of Kawaiahaʻo had supported her opponents. Bishop Willis visited and wrote to her during her imprisonment and sent her a copy of the Book of Common Prayer. Shortly after her release on parole, the former queen was baptized and confirmed by Bishop Willis on May 18, 1896, in a private ceremony in the presence of the sisters of St. Andrew&#x27;s Priory. In her memoir, Liliʻuokalani stated:

That first night of my imprisonment was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; it seemed as though the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me from time to time in my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.

She traveled to Utah in 1901 for a visit with Mormon president Joseph F. Smith, a former missionary to the Hawaiian Island. There she joined in services at the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and was feted at a Beehive House reception, attended by many expatriate Native Hawaiians. In 1906, Mormon newspapers reported she had been baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by Elder Abraham Kaleimahoe Fernandez. However, many historians doubt this claim, since the Queen herself never announced it. In fact, Liliʻuokalani continued to refer to herself as an Episcopalian in secular newspapers published the same week of her supposed Mormon baptism. The Queen&#x27;s interest in Mormonism later waned.

The Queen was also remembered for her support of Buddhist and Shinto priests in Hawaii and became one of the first Native Hawaiians to attend a Buddha&#x27;s Birthday celebration of May 19, 1901, at the Honwangji mission. Her attendance in the celebration helped Buddhism and Shinto gain acceptance into Hawaiian society and prevented the possible banning of the two religions by the Territorial government. Her presence was also widely reported in Chinese and Japanese newspapers throughout the world, and earned her the respect of many Japanese people both in Hawaii and in Japan itself.

== Compositions ==

Liliʻuokalani was an accomplished author and songwriter. Her book &quot;Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Story by Hawaiʻi&#x27;s Queen&quot; gave her view of the history of her country and her overthrow. She is said to have played guitar, piano, organ, ʻukulele and zither, and also sang alto, performing Hawaiian and English sacred and secular music. In her memoirs she wrote:

Liliʻuokalani helped preserve key elements of Hawaiʻi&#x27;s traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Songbook&quot;, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions as a way to express her feelings for her people, her country, and what was happening in the political realm in Hawaiʻi. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant passed down orally by her great grandmother Alapaiwahine. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family&#x27;s genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaiʻi.

After Liliʻuokalani was imprisoned in the ʻIolani Palace, she was denied literature and newspapers, essentially cutting her off from her people, but she continued to compose music with paper and pencil while she was in confinement.
Another of her compositions was &quot;Aloha ʻOe&quot;, a song she had written previously and transcribed during her confinement. In her writings, she says, &quot;At first I had no instrument, and had to transcribe the notes by voice alone; but I found, notwithstanding disadvantages, great consolation in composing, and transcribed a number of songs. Three found their way from my prison to the city of Chicago, where they were printed, among them the &#x27;Aloha ʻOe&#x27; or &#x27;Farewell to Thee&#x27;, which became a very popular song.&quot; Originally written as a lover&#x27;s good-bye, the song came to be regarded as a symbol of, and lament for, the loss of her country. Today, it is one of the most recognizable Hawaiian songs.

== Legacy ==
Captain Julius A. Palmer Jr. of Massachusetts was her friend for three decades, and became her spokesperson when she was in residence at Boston and Washington, D.C., protesting the annexation of Hawaiʻi. In the nation&#x27;s capital, he estimated that she had 5,000 visitors. When asked by an interviewer, &quot;What are her most distinctive personal graces?&quot;, Palmer replied, &quot;Above everything else she displayed a disposition of the most Christian forgiveness.&quot; In covering her death and funeral, the mainstream newspapers in Hawaii that had supported the overthrow and annexation recognized that she had been held in great esteem around the world. In March 2016, &quot;Hawaiʻi Magazine&quot; listed Liliʻuokalani as one of the most influential women in Hawaiian history.

The Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust was established on December 2, 1909, for the care of orphaned and destitute children in Hawaii. Effective upon her death, the proceeds of her estate, with the exception of twelve individual inheritances specified therein, were to be used for the Trust. The largest of these hereditary estates were willed to her &quot;hānai&quot; sons and their heirs: John ʻAimoku Dominis would receive Washington Place while Joseph Kaiponohea ʻAeʻa would receive Kealohilani, her residence at Waikiki. Both men predeceased the Queen. Before and after her death, lawsuits were filed to overturn her will establishing the Trust. One notable litigant was Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, the nephew of her brother Kalākaua and his wife Kapiʻolani and Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s second cousin, who brought a suit against the Trust on November 30, 1915, questioning the Queen&#x27;s competency in executing the will and attempting to break the Trust. These lawsuits were resolved in 1923 and the will went into probate. The Queen Liliʻuokalani Children&#x27;s Center was created by the Trust.

Liliʻuokalani and her siblings are recognized by the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame as &quot;Na Lani ʻEhā&quot; (&quot;The Heavenly Four&quot;) for their patronage and enrichment of Hawaii&#x27;s musical culture and history. In 2007, &quot;Honolulu&quot; magazine rated &quot;Aloha ʻOe&quot; as the greatest song in the history of Hawaiian music. Songwriter Charles E. King, known as the composer of &quot;Ke Kali Nei Au&quot;, was tutored in music by her. Entertainer Bina Mossman led the Bina Mossman Glee Club that rehearsed regularly at Washington Place, while Liliʻuokalani helped them with pronunciation of the Hawaiian language. At the queen&#x27;s funeral, the glee club was part of the kahili bearers who stood watch over the coffin for two hours at a time, waving the kahilis and singing Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s compositions.

The annual Queen Liliʻuokalani Outrigger Canoe Race, which follows an 18-mile course from Kailua Bay to Honaunau Bay, was organized in 1972 as an endurance training course for men, in preparation for the traditional Molokaʻi to Oʻahu canoe races. Women canoe teams were added in 1974. The race is held over Labor Day Weekend each year to coincide with Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s birthday on September 2.

Numerous hula events are held to honor her memory, including the Queen Liliʻuokalani Keiki Hula Competition Honolulu, organized in 1976. The County of Hawaii holds an annual He Hali&#x27;a Aloha no Lili&#x27;uokalani Festival, Queen&#x27;s Birthday Celebration at Liliʻuokalani Park and Gardens in Hilo, in partnership with the Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani Trust. The event begins with several hundred dancers showered by 50,000 orchid blossoms.

In the 2001 naming of the &quot;Queen Liliʻuokalani Center for Student Services&quot;, on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, the Board of Regents noted, &quot;As the last Hawaiian monarch, Queen Liliʻuokalani symbolizes an important link to traditional Hawaiian culture and society. Her influence is well understood, widely respected and has been a strong motivating factor in the widespread emergence of Hawaiian culture and the values embodied in it.&quot;

In 2017, Edgy Lee researched and filmed &quot;Liliuokalani – Reflections of Our Queen&quot;, a documentary looking at the legacy of the queen in Hawaii. A showing at Washington Place fundraised for the museum. Liliʻuokalani and the overthrow have been subject of documentaries including &quot;The American Experience: Hawaii&#x27;s Last Queen&quot; (1994) and &quot;Conquest of Hawaii&quot; (2003).

In October 2022, a Royal Standard of Queen Liliuʻokalani was listed for auction by a private collector at Bonhams New York, along with other artifacts associated with Hawaiʻi&#x27;s history. The flag, which was flown over Washington Place at the time of the overthrow, had been seized by Colonel John Harris Soper, commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Provisional Government. On October 13, 2022, the Hawaiʻi State Department of the Attorney General transmitted a &quot;Notice of Claim&quot; letter to Bonhams, threatening legal proceedings to recover the Royal Standard and certain other items in the auction, which the letter asserted were property of the State of Hawaii. Following receipt of the letter, Bonhams removed the items from the auction. In March 2023, it was reported that the Royal Standard and certain other artifacts from the auction were purchased by the State of Hawaiʻi using funds donated by the estate of Princess Abigail Kinoiki Kekaulike Kawānanakoa and Brendan Damon Ethington. Upon the flag&#x27;s return to Washington Place in July 2023, Dr. Adam Jansen, state archivist, noted that the flag was in poor condition, with tears and multiple holes, and said he was looking for fabric specialists to restore and preserve it.

<text>In psychoanalysis, a Freudian slip, also called parapraxis, is an error in speech, memory, or physical action that occurs due to the interference of an unconscious subdued wish or internal train of thought. Classical examples involve slips of the tongue, but psychoanalytic theory also embraces misreadings, mishearings, mistypings, temporary forgettings, and the mislaying and losing of objects.

==History==
=== Origin and development ===
The Freudian slip is named after Sigmund Freud, who, in his 1901 book &quot;The Psychopathology of Everyday Life&quot;, described and analyzed a large number of seemingly trivial, even bizarre, or nonsensical errors and slips, most notably the Signorelli parapraxis.

Freud, himself, referred to these slips as (meaning &quot;faulty functions&quot;, &quot;faulty actions&quot; or &quot;misperformances&quot; in German); the Greek term &quot;parapraxes&quot; (plural of &quot;parapraxis&quot;; ) was the creation of his English translator, as is the form &quot;symptomatic action&quot;.

Freud&#x27;s process of psychoanalysis is often described as being lengthy and complex, as was the case with many of the dreams in his 1899 book &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;. An obstacle that faces the non-German-speaking reader is such that in original German, &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot;, Freud&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;slips of the tongue&quot; leads to the inclusion of a great deal of colloquial and informal material that are extremely resistant to translations.

As in the study of dreams, Freud submits his discussion with the intention of demonstrating the existence of unconscious mental processes in the healthy:

== Research and studies ==

A 1979 study investigated Freudian slips by having male test participants who had been primed with a stimulus either related to sex or an electric shock to read a list of words that had meaningful spoonerisms related to both stimuli. Primed participants had a far higher rate of spoonerism related to the specific stimulus.
This aligns with the psychoanalytic theory that unconscious desires or fears influence speech, as demonstrated in Michael Fontaine&#x27;s analysis of Plautus&#x27;s Menaechmi. Fontaine explores how linguistic missteps, such as spoonerisms, can reveal latent desires and thoughts. Fontaine argues that in Plautus&#x27;s plays, seemingly accidental slips of the tongue often carry significant psychological and thematic weight, revealing characters&#x27; unconscious motivations (Fontaine, 2007). Just as the test subjects in the 1979 study were more likely to produce slips related to their primed stimuli, characters in Plautus&#x27;s comedies reveal hidden truths through their verbal missteps, offering a comedic yet insightful view of the human psyche.

==Alternative explanations==

In contrast to psychoanalytic theorists, cognitive psychologists say that linguistic slips can represent a sequencing conflict in grammar production. From this perspective, slips may be due to cognitive underspecification that can take a variety of forms – inattention, incomplete sense data or insufficient knowledge. Secondly, they may be due to the existence of some locally appropriate response pattern that is strongly primed by its prior usage, recent activation or emotional change or by the situation calling conditions.

Some sentences are just susceptible to the process of banalisation: the replacement of archaic or unusual expressions with forms that are in more common use. In other words, the errors were due to strong habit substitution.

=== Slips of the tongue ===
In general use, the term &#x27;Freudian slip&#x27; has been debased to refer to any accidental slips of the tongue. Thus many examples are found in explanations and dictionaries which do not strictly fit the psychoanalytic definition.

For example: She: &#x27;What would you like—bread and butter, or cake?&#x27; He: &#x27;Bed and butter.&#x27;

In the above, the man may be presumed to have a sexual feeling or intention that he wished to leave unexpressed, &quot;not&quot; a sexual feeling or intention that was dynamically repressed. His sexual intention was therefore &quot;secret&quot;, rather than &quot;subconscious&quot;, and any &#x27;parapraxis&#x27; would inhere in the idea that he &quot;unconsciously wished to express that intention&quot;, rather than in the sexual connotation of the substitution. Freudians might point out, however, that this is simply a description of what Freud and Breuer termed the preconscious which Freud defined as thoughts that are not presently conscious but can become conscious without meeting any resistance. In Freud&#x27;s theory, he allows parapraxes to be generated in the preconscious, so he would allow for thoughts that one tries to put outside of consciousness to have effects on conscious actions.

=== Human-computer interaction ===
Beyond slips of the tongue, these accidental human errors also commonly occur in the realm of human-computer interaction. In the context of interaction design, slips refer to an incorrect action that is taken with the correct intention. As opposed to mistakes, which refer to an incorrect action due to an incorrect intention, slips result from automatic behaviors that are triggered by external factors, distracting the user from carrying out their intended goal. There are many different types of slips in interaction design, including capture errors, description similarity slips, data-driven errors, associative activation, loss of activation, and mode errors.

Capture errors occur when a familiar behavior takes over a less frequently occurring behavior. An example of a capture error would be driving to the office on a Saturday when the intention was to go to the grocery store.

Description similarity slips occur when an action is taken upon an item that is similar to the one you intended. For example, flipping the switch for the bathroom vent fan instead of the light switch to turn on the bathroom light would be a description similarity slip.

Data-driven errors occur in the arrival of new sensory information that triggers an automatic response, such as dialing the hotel concierge to reserve a particular room and dialing the room number instead.

Associative activation errors are caused by an internal correlation of two actions. For example, associating the phone ringing with someone knocking on the door and saying &quot;come in&quot; as a response would represent a type of associative activation error. Associative activation errors are also considered accidental slips of the tongue.

Loss of activation is the error of executing an action but forgetting the goal behind the intended action. A common example of a loss of activation error is walking into a room and forgetting the purpose for walking into the room.

Lastly, mode errors occur when the input for an action is the same for different modes of operation, but the output of that action varies according to the selected mode. These errors could easily occur with the gear shift control in cars, since the action of stepping on the gas pedal to execute the action is the same for all gears, but the direction in which the car moves depends on the selected gear. This could lead to detrimental consequences if a user was accidentally in reverse mode but intended to be in drive mode.

<text>Christine Marion Korsgaard, (; born April 9, 1952) is an American philosopher who is the Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Philosophy Emerita at Harvard University. Her main scholarly interests are in moral philosophy and its history; the relation of issues in moral philosophy to issues in metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and the theory of personal identity; the theory of personal relationships; and in normativity in general.

==Education and career==
Korsgaard first attended Eastern Illinois University for two years and transferred to receive a B.A. from the University of Illinois and a Ph.D from Harvard, where she was a student of John Rawls. She was awarded an honorary LHD Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Illinois in 2004. She is a 1970 alumna of Homewood-Flossmoor High School in Flossmoor, Ill.

She has taught at Yale, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Chicago; since 1991 she has been a professor at Harvard University, where she was Arthur Kingsley Porter Professor of Philosophy, and is now emerita.

In 1996 Korsgaard published a book entitled &quot;The Sources of Normativity&quot;, which was the revised version of her Tanner Lectures on Human Values, and also a collection of her past papers on Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy and Kantian approaches to contemporary moral philosophy: &quot;Creating the Kingdom of Ends&quot;. In 2002, she was the first woman to give the John Locke Lectures at the University of Oxford, which turned into her 2009 book &quot;Self-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity&quot;.

She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences in 2001 and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 2015. She served as President of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association in 2008–2009, and held a Mellon Distinguished Achievement Award from 2006–2009.

==Animal rights==

Korsgaard is an advocate of animal rights. She was a vegetarian for over 40 years and is now a vegan. In 2018, Korsgaard authored &quot;Fellow Creatures: Our Obligations to Other Animals&quot; which argues that Kantian ethics supports animal rights.

She has also given several lectures about animal rights, including the 2014 Uehiro Lectures on The Moral and Legal Standing of Animals. In these lectures, Korsgaard argues that importance is tethered to a creature who finds it important. While according to this view there is no &quot;free-floating&quot; untethered importance, there is absolute importance, which occurs when something is important to all beings. Therefore, to Korsgaard, the statement that animals are universally less important than humans is not incorrect, but incoherent. She distinguishes between the evaluative or functional good, where something is good because it is able to perform its function well, and the final good, where an end or a life is good. Final goods are what make things important, and a thing possesses the final good if things can be good or bad for that thing. She also distinguishes between ordinary objects such as knives, for which being sharpened is good in the sense that it helps the knife achieve its function of cutting well, organisms, which have a function to tend to their and their species&#x27; own well-functioning, and animals, a particular kind of organism which represent the world to themselves and act using this representation for the function of self-maintenance. This representation enables the animal to have self-maintenance not only as a functional good, but also as a final good. Therefore, final goods need not come from people, the being is committed to valuing the ends of all beings with the final good (animals). In other words, all animals are passive ends-in-of-themselves, but non-person are not active ends-in-of-themselves.

<text>The common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), also known as the Eurasian kingfisher and river kingfisher, is a small kingfisher with seven subspecies recognized within its wide distribution across Eurasia and North Africa. It is resident in much of its range, but migrates from areas where rivers freeze in winter.

This sparrow-sized bird has the typical short-tailed, large-headed kingfisher profile; it has blue upperparts, orange underparts and a long bill. It feeds mainly on fish, caught by diving, and has special visual adaptations to enable it to see prey under water. The glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank.

==Taxonomy==
The common kingfisher was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758 as &quot;Gracula atthis&quot;. The modern binomial name derives from the Latin &#x27;, &#x27;kingfisher&#x27; (from Greek , &#x27;), and &quot;Atthis&quot;, a beautiful young woman of Lesbos, and favourite of Sappho.

The genus &quot;Alcedo&quot; comprises seven small kingfishers that all eat fish as part of their diet. The common kingfisher&#x27;s closest relative is the cerulean kingfisher that has white underparts and is found in parts of Indonesia.

==Description==
This species has the typical short-tailed, dumpy-bodied, large-headed, and long-billed kingfisher shape. The adult male of the western European subspecies, &quot;A. a. ispida&quot; has green-blue upperparts with pale azure-blue back and rump, a rufous patch by the bill base, and a rufous ear-patch. It has a green-blue neck stripe, white neck blaze and throat, rufous underparts, and a black bill with some red at the base. The legs and feet are bright red. It is about long with a wingspan of , and weighs . The female is identical in appearance to the male except that her lower mandible is orange-red with a black tip. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but with duller and greener upperparts and paler underparts. Its bill is black, and the legs are also initially black. Feathers are moulted gradually between July and November with the main flight feathers taking 90–100 days to moult and regrow. Some that moult late may suspend their moult during cold winter weather.

The flight of the kingfisher is fast, direct and usually low over water. The short, rounded wings whirr rapidly, and a bird flying away shows an electric-blue &quot;flash&quot; down its back.

In North Africa, Europe and Asia north of the Himalayas, this is the only small blue kingfisher. In south and southeast Asia, it can be confused with six other small blue-and-rufous kingfishers, but the rufous ear patches distinguish it from all but juvenile blue-eared kingfishers; details of the head pattern may be necessary to differentiate the two species where both occur.

The common kingfisher has no song. The flight call is a short, sharp whistle &quot;chee&quot; repeated two or three times. Anxious birds emit a harsh, &quot;shrit-it-it&quot; and nestlings call for food with a churring noise.

===Geographical variation===

There are seven subspecies differing in the hue of the upperparts and the intensity of the rufous colour of the underparts; size varies across the subspecies by up to 10%. The races resident south of the Wallace Line have the bluest upperparts and partly blue ear-patches.
* &quot;A. a. ispida&quot; . Breeds from Ireland, Spain and southern Norway to Romania and western Russia and winters south to Iraq and southern Portugal.
* &quot;A. a. atthis&quot;. Breeds from northwestern Africa and southern Italy east to Afghanistan, Kashmir region, northern Xinjiang, and Siberia; it is a winter visitor south to Israel, northeastern Sudan, Yemen, Oman and Pakistan. Compared to &quot;A. a. ispida&quot;, it has a greener crown, paler underparts and is slightly larger.
* &quot;A. a. bengalensis&quot; . Breeds in southern and eastern Asia from India to Indonesia, China, Korea, Japan and eastern Mongolia; winters south to Indonesia and the Philippines. It is smaller and brighter than the European races.
* &quot;A. a. taprobana&quot; . Resident breeder in Sri Lanka and southern India. Its upperparts are bright blue, not green-blue; it is the same size as &quot;A. a. bengalensis&quot;.
* &quot;A. a. floresiana&quot; . Resident breeder from Bali to Timor. Like &quot;A. a. taprobana&quot;, but the blues are darker and the ear-patch is rufous with a few blue feathers.
* &quot;A. a. hispidoides&quot; . Resident breeder from Sulawesi to New Guinea and the islands of the western Pacific Ocean. Plumage colours are deeper than in &quot;A. a. floresiana&quot;, the blue on the hind neck and rump is purple-tinged and the ear-patch is blue.
* &quot;A. a. solomonensis&quot; . Resident breeder in the Solomon Islands east to San Cristobal. The largest southeast Asian subspecies, it has a blue ear-patch and is more purple-tinged than &quot;A. a. hispidoides&quot;, with which it interbreeds.

==Habitat and distribution==
The common kingfisher is widely distributed over Europe, Asia, and North Africa, mainly south of 60°N. It is a common breeding species over much of its vast Eurasian range, but in North Africa it is mainly a winter visitor, although it is a scarce breeding resident in coastal Morocco and Tunisia. In temperate regions, this kingfisher inhabits clear, slow-flowing streams and rivers, and lakes with well-vegetated banks. It frequents scrubs and bushes with overhanging branches close to shallow open water in which it hunts. In winter it is more coastal, often feeding in estuaries or harbours and along rocky seashores. Tropical populations are found by slow-flowing rivers, in mangrove creeks and in swamps.

Common kingfishers are important members of ecosystems and good indicators of freshwater community health. The highest densities of breeding birds are found in habitats with clear water, which permits optimal prey visibility, and trees or shrubs on the banks. These habitats have also the highest quality of water, so the presence of this bird confirms the standard of the water. Measures to improve water flow can disrupt this habitat, and in particular, the replacement of natural banks by artificial confinement greatly reduces the populations of fish, amphibians and aquatic reptiles, and waterside birds are lost. It can tolerate a certain degree of urbanisation, provided the water remains clean.

This species is resident in areas where the climate is mild year-round, but must migrate after breeding from regions with prolonged freezing conditions in winter. Most birds winter within the southern parts of the breeding range, but smaller numbers cross the Mediterranean into Africa or travel over the mountains of Malaysia into Southeast Asia. Kingfishers migrate mainly at night, and some Siberian breeders must travel at least between the breeding sites and the wintering areas.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Like all kingfishers, the common kingfisher is highly territorial; since it must eat around 60% of its body weight each day, it is essential to have control of a suitable stretch of river. It is solitary for most of the year, roosting alone in heavy cover. If another kingfisher enters its territory, both birds display from perches, and fights may occur, in which a bird will grab the other&#x27;s beak and try to hold it underwater. Pairs form in the autumn but each bird retains a separate territory, generally at least long, but up to and territories are not merged until the spring.

The courtship is initiated by the male chasing the female while calling continually, and later by ritual feeding, with copulation usually following.

The nest is in a burrow excavated by both birds of the pair in a low vertical riverbank, or sometimes a quarry or other cutting. The straight, gently inclining burrow is normally long and ends in an enlarged chamber. The nest cavity is unlined but soon accumulates a litter of fish remains and cast pellets.

The common kingfisher typically lays two to ten glossy white eggs, which average in breadth, in length, and weigh about , of which 5% is shell. Both sexes incubate by day, but only the female incubates at night. An incubating bird sits trance-like, facing the tunnel; it invariably casts a pellet, breaking it up with the bill. The eggs hatch in 19–20 days, one or two eggs in most clutches fail to do so because the parent cannot cover them prior. The altricial young are in the nest for a further 24–25 days, often more. Once large enough, young birds will come to the burrow entrance to be fed. Two broods, sometimes three, may be reared in a season.

===Survival===
The early days for fledged juveniles are more hazardous; during its first dives into the water, about four days after leaving the nest, a fledgling may become waterlogged and drown. Many young will not have learned to fish by the time they are driven out of their parents&#x27; territory, and only about half survive more than a week or two. Most kingfishers die of cold or lack of food, and a severe winter can kill a high percentage of the birds. Summer floods can destroy nests or make fishing difficult, resulting in starvation of the brood. Only a quarter of the young survive to breed the following year, but this is enough to maintain the population. Likewise, only a quarter of adult birds survive from one breeding season to the next. Very few birds live longer than one breeding season. The oldest bird on record was 21 years.

Other causes of death are cats, rats, collisions with vehicles and windows, and human disturbance of nesting birds, including riverbank works with heavy machinery. Since kingfishers are high up in the food chain, they are vulnerable to build-up of chemicals, and river pollution by industrial and agricultural products excludes the birds from many stretches of otherwise suitable rivers that would be habitats.

This species was killed in Victorian times for stuffing and display in glass cases and use in hat making. English naturalist William Yarrell also reported the country practice of killing a kingfisher and hanging it from a thread in the belief that it would swing to predict the direction in which the wind would blow. Persecution by anglers and to provide feathers for fishing flies were common in earlier decades, but are now largely a thing of the past.

===Feeding===
The common kingfisher hunts from a perch above the water, on a branch, post or riverbank, bill pointing down as it searches for prey. It bobs its head when food is detected to gauge the distance and plunges steeply down to seize its prey usually no deeper than below the surface. The wings are opened underwater and the open eyes are protected by the transparent third eyelid. The bird rises beak-first from the surface and flies back to its perch. At the perch the fish is adjusted until it is held near its tail and beaten against the perch several times. Once dead, the fish is positioned lengthways and swallowed head-first. A few times each day, a small greyish pellet of fish bones and other indigestible remains is regurgitated.

The food is mainly fish up to long, but the average size is . In Central Europe, 97% of the diet was found to be composed of fish ranging in size from 2 to 10 cm with an average of 6.5 cm (body mass range from &lt;0.1 g to &gt;10 g, average 3 g). Minnows, sticklebacks, small roach and trout are typical prey. About 60% of food items are fish, but this kingfisher also catches aquatic insects such as dragonfly larvae and water beetles, and, in winter, crustaceans including freshwater shrimps. Amphibians such as the smooth newt (&quot;Lissotriton vulgaris&quot;) may also constitute part of the diet of this species. In Central Europe, however, fish represented 99.9% of the diet (data from rivers, streams, and reservoirs from years 1999 to 2013). Common kingfishers have also been observed to catch lamprey. One study found that food provisioning rate increased with brood size, from 1498 g (505 fishes for four nestlings) to 2968 g (894 fishes for eight nestlings). During the fledging period each chick consumed on average 334 g of fish, which resulted in an estimated daily food intake of 37% of the chick&#x27;s body mass (average over the entire nestling period). The average daily energy intake was 73.5 kJ per chick (i.e., 1837 kJ per 25 days of the fledging period).

A challenge for any diving bird is the change in refraction between air and water. The eyes of many birds have two foveae (the fovea is the area of the retina with the greatest density of light receptors), and a kingfisher can switch from the main central fovea to the auxiliary fovea when it enters water; a retinal streak of high receptor density which connects the two foveae allows the image to swing temporally as the bird drops onto the prey. The egg-shaped lens of the eye points towards the auxiliary fovea, enabling the bird to maintain visual acuity underwater. Because of the positions of the foveae, the kingfisher has monocular vision in air, and binocular vision in water. The underwater vision is not as a sharp as in air, but the ability to judge the distance of moving prey is more important than the sharpness of the image.

Each cone cell of a bird&#x27;s retina contains an oil droplet that may contain carotenoid pigments. These droplets enhance color vision and reduce glare. Aquatic kingfishers have high numbers of red pigments in their oil droplets; the reason red droplets predominate is not understood, but the droplets may help with the glare or the dispersion of light from particulate matter in the water.

==Status==
This species has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of . It has a large population, including an estimated 160,000–320,000 individuals in Europe alone. Global population trends have not been quantified, but populations appear to be stable so the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>Zidovudine (ZDV), also known as azidothymidine (AZT), was the first antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use in combination with other antiretrovirals. It may be used to prevent mother-to-child spread during birth or after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is sold both by itself and together as lamivudine/zidovudine and abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine. It can be used by mouth or by slow injection into a vein.
Common side effects include headaches, fever, and nausea. Serious side effects include liver problems, muscle damage, and high blood lactate levels. It is commonly used in pregnancy and appears to be safe for the fetus. ZDV is of the nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class. It works by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase that HIV uses to make DNA and therefore decreases replication of the virus.
Zidovudine was first described in 1964. It was resynthesized from a public-domain formula by Burroughs Wellcome. It was approved in the United States in 1987 and was the first treatment for HIV. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==

===HIV treatment===
AZT was usually dosed twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral therapies. This approach is referred to as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) and is used to prevent the likelihood of HIV resistance. As of 2019, the standard is a three-drug once-daily oral treatment that can include AZT.

===HIV prevention===
AZT has been used for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in combination with another antiretroviral drug called lamivudine. Together they work to substantially reduce the risk of HIV infection following the first single exposure to the virus. More recently, AZT has been replaced by other antiretrovirals such as tenofovir to provide PEP.
Before tenofovir, a principal part of the clinical pathway for both pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment of mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and has been proven to be integral to uninfected siblings&#x27; perinatal and neonatal development. Without AZT, 10–15% of fetuses with HIV-infected mothers will themselves become infected. AZT has been shown to reduce this risk to 8% when given in a three-part regimen post-conception, delivery, and six weeks post-delivery. Consistent and proactive precautionary measures, such as the rigorous use of antiretroviral medications, cesarean section, face masks, heavy-duty rubber gloves, clinically segregated disposable diapers, and avoidance of mouth contact will further reduce child-attendant transmission of HIV to as little as 1–2%.

During 1994 to 1999, AZT was the primary form of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. AZT prophylaxis prevented more than 1000 parental and infant deaths from AIDS in the United States. In the U.S. at that time, the accepted standard of care for HIV-positive mothers was known as the 076 regimen and involved five daily doses of AZT from the second trimester onwards, as well as AZT intravenously administered during labour. As this treatment was lengthy and expensive, it was deemed unfeasible in the Global South, where mother-to-child transmission was a significant problem. A number of studies were initiated in the late 1990s that sought to test the efficacy of a shorter, simpler regimen for use in &#x27;resource-poor&#x27; countries. This AZT short course was an inferior standard of care and would have been considered malpractice if trialed in the US; however, it was nonetheless a treatment that would improve the care and survival of impoverished subjects.

=== Antibacterial properties ===
Zidovudine also has antibacterial properties, though not routinely used in clinical settings. It acts on bacteria with a mechanism of action still not fully explained. Promising results from &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; studies showed the efficacy of AZT also against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (including mcr-1 carrying and metallo-β-lactamase producing isolates), especially in combination with other active agents (e.g. fosfomycin, colistin, tigecycline).

==Side effects==
Most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, acid reflux (heartburn), headache, cosmetic reduction in abdominal body fat, trouble sleeping, and loss of appetite. Less common side effects include faint discoloration of fingernails and toenails, mood elevation, occasional tingling or transient numbness of the hands or feet, and minor skin discoloration. Allergic reactions are rare.

Early long-term higher-dose therapy with AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. All of these conditions were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They have been attributed to several possible causes, including transient depletion of mitochondrial DNA, sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell mitochondria, the depletion of thymidine triphosphate, oxidative stress, reduction of intracellular -carnitine or apoptosis of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, nordazepam, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT.
According to IARC, there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of zidovudine; it is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). In 2009, the State of California added zidovudine to its list of chemicals &quot;known to the state of California to cause cancer and other reproductive harm.&quot;

===Viral resistance===
Even at the highest doses that can be tolerated in patients, AZT is not potent enough to prevent all HIV replication and may only slow the replication of the virus and progression of the disease. Prolonged AZT treatment can lead to HIV developing resistance to AZT by mutation of its reverse transcriptase. To slow the development of resistance, physicians generally recommend that AZT be given in combination with another reverse-transcriptase inhibitor and an antiretroviral from another group, such as a protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor; this type of therapy is known as HAART (Highly Active Anti Retroviral Therapy).

==Mechanism of action==

AZT is a thymidine analogue. AZT works by selectively inhibiting HIV&#x27;s reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that the virus uses to make a DNA copy of its RNA. Reverse transcription is necessary for production of HIV&#x27;s double-stranded DNA, which would be subsequently integrated into the genetic material of the infected cell (where it is called a provirus).

Cellular enzymes convert AZT into the effective 5&#x27;-triphosphate form. Studies have shown that the termination of HIV&#x27;s forming DNA chains is the specific factor in the inhibitory effect.

At very high doses, AZT&#x27;s triphosphate form may also inhibit DNA polymerase used by human cells to undergo cell division, but regardless of dosage AZT has an approximately 100-fold greater affinity for HIV&#x27;s reverse transcriptase. The selectivity has been suggested to be due to the cell&#x27;s ability to quickly repair its own DNA chain if it is disrupted by AZT during its formation, whereas the HIV virus lacks that ability. Thus AZT inhibits HIV replication without affecting the function of uninfected cells. At sufficiently high dosages, AZT begins to inhibit the cellular DNA polymerase used by mitochondria to replicate, accounting for its potentially toxic but reversible effects on cardiac and skeletal muscles, causing myositis.

==Chemistry==
Enantiopure AZT crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21. The primary intermolecular bonding motif is a hydrogen bonded dimeric ring formed from two N-H...O interactions.

==History==

===Initial cancer research===

In the 1960s, the theory that most cancers were caused by environmental retroviruses gained clinical support and funding. It had recently become known, due to the work of Nobel laureates Howard Temin and David Baltimore, that nearly all avian cancers were caused by bird retroviruses, but corresponding human retroviruses had not yet been found.

In parallel work, other compounds that successfully blocked the synthesis of nucleic acids had been proven to be both antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, the leading work being done at the laboratory of Nobel laureates George H. Hitchings and Gertrude Elion, leading to the development of the antitumor agent 6-mercaptopurine.

Richard E. Beltz first synthesized AZT in 1961, but did not publish his research.Jerome Horwitz of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute and Wayne State University School of Medicine synthesized AZT in 1964 under a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant. Development was shelved after it proved biologically inert in mice. In 1974, Wolfram Ostertag of the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in Göttingen, Germany, reported that AZT specifically targeted Friend virus (strain of murine leukemia virus).

This report attracted little interest from other researchers as the Friend leukemia virus is a retrovirus, and at the time, there were no known human diseases caused by retroviruses.

===HIV/AIDS research===

In 1983, researchers at the Institut Pasteur in Paris identified the retrovirus now known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) as the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. Shortly thereafter, Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan of the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) initiated a program to develop therapies for HIV/AIDS. Using a line of CD4+ T cells that they had made, they developed an assay to screen drugs for their ability to protect CD4+ T cells from being killed by HIV. In order to expedite the process of discovering a drug, the NCI researchers actively sought collaborations with pharmaceutical companies having access to libraries of compounds with potential antiviral activity. This assay could simultaneously test both the anti-HIV effect of the compounds and their toxicity against infected T cells.

In June 1984, Burroughs-Wellcome virologist Marty St. Clair set up a program to discover drugs with the potential to inhibit HIV replication. Burroughs-Wellcome had expertise in nucleoside analogs and viral diseases, led by researchers including George Hitchings, Gertrude Elion, David Barry, Paul (Chip) McGuirt Jr., Philip Furman, Martha St. Clair, Janet Rideout, Sandra Lehrman and others. Their research efforts were focused in part on the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that retroviruses, including HIV, utilize to replicate themselves. Secondary testing was performed in mouse cells infected with the retroviruses Friend virus or Harvey sarcoma virus, as the Wellcome group did not have a viable in-house HIV antiviral assay in place at that time, and these other retroviruses were believed to represent reasonable surrogates. AZT proved to be a remarkably potent inhibitor of both Friend virus and Harvey sarcoma virus, and a search of the company&#x27;s records showed that it had demonstrated low toxicity when tested for its antibacterial activity in rats many years earlier. Based in part on these results, AZT was selected by nucleoside chemist Janet Rideout as one of 11 compounds to send to the NCI for testing in that organization&#x27;s HIV antiviral assay.

In February 1985, the NCI scientists found that AZT had potent efficacy in vitro. 
Several months later, a phase 1 clinical trial of AZT at the NCI was initiated at the NCI and Duke University. 
In doing this Phase I trial, they built on their experience in doing an earlier trial, with suramin, another drug that had shown effective anti-HIV activity in the laboratory. This initial trial of AZT proved that the drug could be safely administered to patients with HIV, that it increased their CD4 counts, restored T cell immunity as measured by skin testing, and that it showed strong evidence of clinical effectiveness, such as inducing weight gain in AIDS patients. It also showed that levels of AZT that worked in vitro could be injected into patients in serum and suppository form, and that the drug penetrated deeply only into infected brains.

===Patent filed and FDA approval===

A flawed double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of AZT was subsequently conducted by Burroughs-Wellcome and suggested that AZT safely prolongs the lives of people with HIV. However, it was quickly unblinded and several more in the drug receiving group later perished. Burroughs-Wellcome filed for a patent for AZT in 1985. The Anti-Infective Advisory Committee to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted ten to one to recommend the approval of AZT. The FDA approved the drug (via the then-new FDA accelerated approval system) for use against HIV, AIDS, and AIDS Related Complex (ARC, a now-obsolete medical term for pre-AIDS illness) on March 20, 1987. The time between the first demonstration that AZT was active against HIV in the laboratory and its approval was 25 months.

AZT was subsequently approved unanimously for infants and children in 1990. AZT was initially administered in significantly higher dosages than today, typically 400 mg every four hours, day and night, compared to modern dosage of 300 mg twice daily. The paucity of alternatives for treating HIV/AIDS at that time unambiguously affirmed the health risk/benefit ratio, with inevitable slow, disfiguring, and painful death from HIV outweighing the drug&#x27;s side effect of transient anemia and malaise.

==Society and culture==
Until 1991, 80% of the $420 million allocated to the National Institute of Health&#x27;s AIDS Clinical Trials Group, went toward studies of AZT. Aside from two similarly designed chemotherapies, ddI and ddC, from approval of the drug until 1993, no other drugs against AIDS were approved, leading to criticism that research preoccupation with AZT and its close relatives, and the massive diverting of funds to such, had delayed the development of more efficacious drugs.
In 1991, the advocacy group Public Citizen filed a lawsuit claiming that the patents were invalid. Subsequently, Barr Laboratories and Novopharm Ltd. also challenged the patent, in part based on the assertion that NCI scientists Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan should have been named as inventors, and those two companies applied to the FDA to sell AZT as a generic drug. In response, Burroughs Wellcome Co. filed a lawsuit against the two companies. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in 1992 in favor of Burroughs Wellcome, ruling that even though they had never tested it against HIV, they had conceived of it working before they sent it to the NCI scientists. This suit was appealed up to the Supreme Court of the US, but in 1996 the Court declined to formally review it. The case, &quot;Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Barr Laboratories&quot;, was a landmark in US law of inventorship.

In 2002, another lawsuit was filed challenging the patent by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which also filed an antitrust case against GSK. The patent case was dismissed in 2003 and AHF filed a new case challenging the patent.

GSK&#x27;s patents on AZT expired in 2005, and in September 2005, the FDA approved three generic versions.

<text>Jerome Phillip Horwitz (January 16, 1919 – September 6, 2012) was an American scientist; his affiliations included the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, the Wayne State University School of Medicine and the Michigan Cancer Foundation.

== Background ==

Horwitz was a Jewish Detroit native and 1937 graduate of Central High School.

He earned his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in chemistry from the University of Detroit; his doctorate in chemistry came from the University of Michigan. He completed his post-doctoral training at Northwestern University and the University of Michigan

== Clinical breakthroughs ==

In 1964, while conducting research for the Michigan Cancer Foundation, Horwitz synthesized a compound that was to become known as zidovudine (AZT) - an antiviral drug used to treat HIV patients; Zidovudine was initially developed as a treatment for cancer. Horwitz was also first to synthesize stavudine (d4T) and zalcitabine (ddC) - two other reverse-transcriptase inhibitors used in the treatment of HIV patients.

Also during 1964, he published the first production and demonstration of X-gal as a chromogenic substrate.

After synthesizing AZT, Horwitz went on to create many successful treatments for cancer and other diseases. At the time of his most recent findings, Horwitz was working for the Michigan Cancer Foundation with a federal grant from the National Institutes of Health; he retired in 2005.

== Of further note ==

*Horwitz was featured in the documentary film &quot;I am alive today - History of an AIDS drug&quot;.
*While some believe Horwitz was referenced in the Captain Underpants books, the Jerome Horwitz Elementary School in the children&#x27;s book series was in fact named after Curly Howard from the Three Stooges. (Jerome Horwitz was Curly&#x27;s given name.)

<doc id="195193" wikidata="Q527" url="?curid=195193" title="Sky">
<text>The sky is an unobstructed view upward from the surface of the Earth. It includes the atmosphere and outer space. It may also be considered a place between the ground and outer space, thus distinct from outer space.

In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere. This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting. The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.

Usually, the term &quot;sky&quot; informally refers to a perspective from the Earth&#x27;s surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary. An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part of the sky, which resembles a dome (sometimes called the &quot;sky bowl&quot;) appearing flatter during the day than at night. In some cases, such as in discussing the weather, the sky refers to only the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere.

The daytime sky appears blue because air molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of sunlight more than longer ones (redder light). The night sky appears to be a mostly dark surface or region spangled with stars. The Sun and sometimes the Moon are visible in the daytime sky unless obscured by clouds. At night, the Moon, planets, and stars are similarly visible in the sky.

Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae. Lightning and precipitation are also visible in the sky. Certain birds and insects, as well as human inventions like aircraft and kites, can fly in the sky. Due to human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are often seen above large cities.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sky&quot; comes from the Old Norse , meaning &#x27;cloud, abode of God&#x27;. The Norse term is also the source of the Old English , which shares the same Indo-European base as the classical Latin , meaning &#x27;obscure&#x27;.

In Old English, the term &quot;heaven&quot; was used to describe the observable expanse above the earth. During the period of Middle English, &quot;heaven&quot; began shifting toward its current, religious meaning.

== During daytime ==


Except for direct sunlight, most of the light in the daytime sky is caused by scattering, which is dominated by a small-particle limit called Rayleigh scattering. The scattering due to molecule-sized particles (as in air) is greater in the directions both toward and away from the source of light than it is in directions perpendicular to the incident path. Scattering is significant for light at all visible wavelengths, but is stronger at the shorter (bluer) end of the visible spectrum, meaning that the scattered light is bluer than its source: the Sun. The remaining direct sunlight, having lost some of its shorter-wavelength components, appears slightly less blue.

Scattering also occurs even more strongly in clouds. Individual water droplets refract white light into a set of colored rings. If a cloud is thick enough, scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed-out white color.

The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red, orange, purple, and yellow (especially near sunset or sunrise) when the light must travel a much longer path (or optical depth) through the atmosphere. Scattering effects also partially polarize light from the sky and are most pronounced at an angle 90° from the Sun. Scattered light from the horizon travels through as much as 38 times the air mass as does light from the zenith, causing a blue gradient looking vivid at the zenith and pale near the horizon. Red light is also scattered if there is enough air between the source and the observer, causing parts of the sky to change color as the Sun rises or sets. As the air mass nears infinity, scattered daylight appears whiter and whiter.

Apart from the Sun, distant clouds or snowy mountaintops may appear yellow. The effect is not very obvious on clear days, but is very pronounced when clouds cover the line of sight, reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight. At higher altitudes, the sky tends toward darker colors since scattering is reduced due to lower air density. An extreme example is the Moon, where no atmospheric scattering occurs, making the lunar sky black even when the Sun is visible.

Sky luminance distribution models have been recommended by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) for the design of daylighting schemes. Recent developments relate to &quot;all sky models&quot; for modelling sky luminance under weather conditions ranging from clear to overcast.

== During twilight ==


The brightness and color of the sky vary greatly over the course of a day, and the primary cause of these properties differs as well. When the Sun is well above the horizon, direct scattering of sunlight (Rayleigh scattering) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. However, during twilight, the period between sunset and night or between night and sunrise, the situation is more complex.

Green flashes and green rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a green spot is visible above the Sun, usually for no more than a second or two, or it may resemble a green ray shooting up from the sunset point. Green flashes are a group of phenomena that stem from different causes, most of which occur when there is a temperature inversion (when the temperature increases with altitude rather than the normal decrease in temperature with altitude). Green flashes may be observed from any altitude (even from an aircraft). They are usually seen above an unobstructed horizon, such as over the ocean, but are also seen above clouds and mountains. Green flashes may also be observed at the horizon in association with the Moon and bright planets, including Venus and Jupiter.

Earth&#x27;s shadow is the shadow that the planet casts through its atmosphere and into outer space. This atmospheric phenomenon is visible during civil twilight (after sunset and before sunrise). When the weather conditions and the observing site permit a clear view of the horizon, the shadow&#x27;s fringe appears as a dark or dull bluish band just above the horizon, in the low part of the sky opposite of the (setting or rising) Sun&#x27;s direction. A related phenomenon is the Belt of Venus (or antitwilight arch), a pinkish band that is visible above the bluish band of Earth&#x27;s shadow in the same part of the sky. No defined line divides Earth&#x27;s shadow and the Belt of Venus; one colored band fades into the other in the sky.

Twilight is divided into three stages according to the Sun&#x27;s depth below the horizon, measured in segments of 6°. After sunset, the civil twilight sets in; it ends when the Sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the nautical twilight, when the Sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon (depth between −6° and −12°), after which comes the astronomical twilight, defined as the period between −12° and −18°. When the Sun drops more than 18° below the horizon, the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely airglow, indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial light pollution.

== During the night ==

The term night sky refers to the sky as seen at night. The term is usually associated with skygazing and astronomy, with reference to views of celestial bodies such as stars, the Moon, and planets that become visible on a clear night after the Sun has set. Natural light sources in a night sky include moonlight, starlight, and airglow, depending on location and timing. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night can be easily observed. Were the sky (in the absence of moon and city lights) absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, farmers have used the state of the night sky as a calendar to determine when to plant crops. The ancient belief in astrology is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The &quot;scientific&quot; study of the night sky and bodies observed within it, meanwhile, takes place in the science of astronomy.

Within visible-light astronomy, the visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by light pollution. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of ambient lighting. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. Special filters and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for the best views, both professional and amateur optical astronomers seek viewing sites located far from major urban areas.

== Use in weather forecasting ==

Along with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future. At night, high thin cirrostratus clouds can lead to halos around the Moon, which indicate the approach of a warm front and its associated rain. Morning fog portends fair conditions and can be associated with a marine layer, an indication of a stable atmosphere. Rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds which prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of thunderstorms could indicate the approach of a cold front. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future. The use of sky cover in weather prediction has led to various weather lore over the centuries.

=== Tropical cyclones ===
Within 36 hours of the passage of a tropical cyclone&#x27;s center, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone&#x27;s direction. Within 24 hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. Within 18 hours of the center&#x27;s approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. Within six hours of the center&#x27;s arrival, rain becomes continuous. Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center&#x27;s passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36 hours after the center&#x27;s passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.

== Use in transportation ==
Flight is the process by which an object moves through or beyond the sky (as in the case of spaceflight), whether by generating aerodynamic lift, propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement, without any direct mechanical support from the ground. The engineering aspects of flight are studied in aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, which is the study of vehicles that travel through the air, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and in ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles. While human beings have been capable of flight via hot air balloons since 1783, other species have used flight for significantly longer. Animals, such as birds, bats, and insects are capable of flight. Spores and seeds from plants use flight, via use of the wind, as a method of propagating their species.

== Significance in mythology ==

Many mythologies have deities especially associated with the sky. In Egyptian religion, the sky was deified as the goddess Nut and as the god Horus. Dyeus is reconstructed as the god of the sky, or the sky personified, in Proto-Indo-European religion, whence Zeus, the god of the sky and thunder in Greek mythology and the Roman god of sky and thunder Jupiter.

In Australian Aboriginal mythology, Altjira (or Arrernte) is the main sky god and also the creator god. In Iroquois mythology, Atahensic was a sky goddess who fell down to the ground during the creation of the Earth. Many cultures have drawn constellations between stars in the sky, using them in association with legends and mythology about their deities.

<doc id="195196" wikidata="Q5419314" url="?curid=195196" title="Examples of Markov chains">
<text>This article contains examples of Markov chains and Markov processes in action.

All examples are in the countable state space. For an overview of Markov chains in general state space, see Markov chains on a measurable state space.

== Discrete-time ==

=== Board games played with dice ===

A game of snakes and ladders or any other game whose moves are determined entirely by dice is a Markov chain, indeed, an absorbing Markov chain. This is in contrast to card games such as blackjack, where the cards represent a &#x27;memory&#x27; of the past moves. To see the difference, consider the probability for a certain event in the game. In the above-mentioned dice games, the only thing that matters is the current state of the board. The next state of the board depends on the current state, and the next roll of the dice. It does not depend on how things got to their current state. In a game such as blackjack, a player can gain an advantage by remembering which cards have already been shown (and hence which cards are no longer in the deck), so the next state (or hand) of the game is not independent of the past states.

=== Random walk Markov chains ===
==== A center-biased random walk ====

Consider a random walk on the number line where, at each step, the position (call it &quot;x&quot;) may change by +1 (to the right) or −1 (to the left) with probabilities:

: formula_1

: formula_2

(where &quot;c&quot; is a constant greater than 0)

For example, if the constant, &quot;c&quot;, equals 1, the probabilities of a move to the left at positions &quot;x&quot; = −2,−1,0,1,2 are given by formula_3 respectively. The random walk has a centering effect that weakens as &quot;c&quot; increases.

Since the probabilities depend only on the current position (value of &quot;x&quot;) and not on any prior positions, this biased random walk satisfies the definition of a Markov chain.

==== Gambling ====

Suppose that one starts with $10, and one wagers $1 on an unending, fair, coin toss indefinitely, or until all of the money is lost. If formula_4 represents the number of dollars one has after &quot;n&quot; tosses, with formula_5, then the sequence formula_6 is a Markov process. If one knows that one has $12 now, then it would be expected that with even odds, one will either have $11 or $13 after the next toss. This guess is not improved by the added knowledge that one started with $10, then went up to $11, down to $10, up to $11, and then to $12. The fact that the guess is not improved by the knowledge of earlier tosses showcases the Markov property, the memoryless property of a stochastic process.

=== A model of language ===
This example came from Markov himself. Markov chose 20,000 letters from Pushkin’s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, classified them into vowels and consonants, and counted the transition probabilities.formula_7The stationary distribution is 43.2 percent vowels and 56.8 percent consonants, which is close to the actual count in the book.

=== A simple weather model ===

The probabilities of weather conditions (modeled as either rainy or sunny), given the weather on the preceding day,
can be represented by a transition matrix:

: formula_8
The matrix &quot;P&quot; represents the weather model in which a sunny day is 90% likely to be followed by another sunny day, and a rainy day is 50% likely to be followed by another rainy day. The columns can be labelled &quot;sunny&quot; and &quot;rainy&quot;, and the rows can be labelled in the same order.

(&quot;P&quot;)&quot;i j&quot; is the probability that, if a given day is of type &quot;i&quot;, it will be
followed by a day of type &quot;j&quot;.

Notice that the rows of &quot;P&quot; sum to 1: this is because &quot;P&quot; is a stochastic matrix.

==== Predicting the weather ====

The weather on day 0 (today) is known to be sunny. This is represented by an initial state vector in which the &quot;sunny&quot; entry is 100%, and the &quot;rainy&quot; entry is 0%:

: formula_9

The weather on day 1 (tomorrow) can be predicted by multiplying the state vector from day 0 by the transition matrix:

: formula_10

Thus, there is a 90% chance that day 1 will also be sunny.

The weather on day 2 (the day after tomorrow) can be predicted in the same way, from the state vector we computed for day 1:

: formula_11
or
: formula_12

General rules for day &quot;n&quot; are:

: formula_13

: formula_14

==== Steady state of the weather ====

In this example, predictions for the weather on more distant days change less and less on each subsequent day and tend towards a steady state vector. This vector represents the probabilities of sunny and rainy weather on all days, and is independent of the initial weather.

The steady state vector is defined as:

:formula_15

but converges to a strictly positive vector only if &quot;P&quot; is a regular transition matrix (that is, there
is at least one &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; with all non-zero entries).

Since q is independent from initial conditions, it must be unchanged when transformed by &quot;P&quot;. This makes it an eigenvector (with eigenvalue 1), and means it can be derived from &quot;P&quot;.

In layman&#x27;s terms, the steady-state vector is the vector that, when we multiply it by &quot;P&quot;, we get the exact same vector back. For the weather example, we can use this to set up a matrix equation:

:formula_16
and since they are a probability vector we know that 
:formula_17

Solving this pair of simultaneous equations gives the steady state vector:

:formula_18

In conclusion, in the long term about 83.3% of days are sunny. Not all Markov processes have a steady state vector. In particular, the transition matrix must be regular. Otherwise, the state vectors will oscillate over time without converging.

=== Stock market ===

A state diagram for a simple example is shown in the figure on the right, using a directed graph to picture the state transitions. The states represent whether a hypothetical stock market is exhibiting a bull market, bear market, or stagnant market trend during a given week. According to the figure, a bull week is followed by another bull week 90% of the time, a bear week 7.5% of the time, and a stagnant week the other 2.5% of the time. Labeling the state space {1 = bull, 2 = bear, 3 = stagnant} the transition matrix for this example is

: formula_19

The distribution over states can be written as a stochastic row vector with the relation . So if at time the system is in state , then three time periods later, at time the distribution is

: formula_20

In particular, if at time the system is in state 2 (bear), then at time the distribution is

: formula_21

Using the transition matrix it is possible to calculate, for example, the long-term fraction of weeks during which the market is stagnant, or the average number of weeks it will take to go from a stagnant to a bull market. Using the transition probabilities, the steady-state probabilities indicate that 62.5% of weeks will be in a bull market, 31.25% of weeks will be in a bear market and 6.25% of weeks will be stagnant, since:

: formula_22

A thorough development and many examples can be found in the on-line monograph Meyn &amp; Tweedie 2005.

A finite-state machine can be used as a representation of a Markov chain. Assuming a sequence of independent and identically distributed input signals (for example, symbols from a binary alphabet chosen by coin tosses), if the machine is in state &quot;y&quot; at time &quot;n&quot;, then the probability that it moves to state &quot;x&quot; at time &quot;n&quot; + 1 depends only on the current state.

== Continuous-time ==

=== A birth–death process ===
If one pops one hundred kernels of popcorn in an oven, each kernel popping at an independent exponentially-distributed time, then this would be a continuous-time Markov process. If formula_23 denotes the number of kernels which have popped up to time &quot;t&quot;, the problem can be defined as finding the number of kernels that will pop in some later time. The only thing one needs to know is the number of kernels that have popped prior to the time &quot;t&quot;. It is not necessary to know &quot;when&quot; they popped, so knowing formula_23 for previous times &quot;t&quot; is not relevant.

The process described here is an approximation of a Poisson point process – Poisson processes are also Markov processes.

<doc id="195198" wikidata="Q192196" url="?curid=195198" title="Mist">
<text>Mist is a phenomenon caused by small droplets of water suspended in the cold air, usually by condensation. Physically, it is an example of a dispersion. It is most commonly seen where water vapor in warm, moist air meets sudden cooling, such as in exhaled air in the winter, or when throwing water onto the hot stove of a sauna. It can be created artificially with aerosol canisters if the humidity and temperature conditions are right. It can also occur as part of natural weather, when humid air cools rapidly, notably when the air comes into contact with surfaces that are much cooler than the air (e.g. mountains).

The formation of mist, as of other suspensions, is greatly aided by the presence of nucleation sites on which the suspended water phase can congeal. Thus even such unusual sources of nucleation as small particulates from volcanic eruptions, releases of strongly polar gases, and even the magnetospheric ions associated with polar lights can in right conditions trigger condensation and the formation of mist.

Mist is commonly confused with fog, which resembles a stratus cloud lying at ground level. These two phenomena differ, but share some commonalities; similar processes form both fog and mist. Fog is denser, more opaque, and generally lasts a longer time, while mist is thinner and more transparent.

==Description==

Cloud cover is often referred to as &quot;mist&quot; when encountered on surfaces of mountains, whereas moisture suspended above a body of water, cleared or marsh area is usually called &quot;fog&quot;. One main difference between mist and fog is visibility. The phenomenon is called fog if the visibility is or less. In the United Kingdom, the definition of fog is visibility less than on the surface for driving purposes, while for pilots the distance is 1 km at cruising height. Otherwise, it is known as mist.

Mist makes a light beam visible from the side via refraction and scattering on the suspended water droplets, and rainbows can be possibly created. 

&quot;Scotch mist&quot; is a light steady drizzle that appears like mist.

Mist usually occurs near the shores and is often associated with fog. Mist can be as high as mountain tops when extreme temperatures are low and strong condensation occurs.

Freezing mist is similar to freezing fog, only the density is less and the visibility greater. When fog falls below 0°C, it is known as freezing fog, however it still stays suspended.

<doc id="195201" wikidata="Q1414480" url="?curid=195201" title="Paraphimosis">
<text>Paraphimosis is an uncommon medical condition in which the foreskin of a penis becomes trapped behind the glans penis, and cannot be &quot;reduced&quot; (pulled back to its normal flaccid position covering the glans). If this condition persists for several hours or there is any sign of a lack of blood flow, paraphimosis should be treated as a medical emergency, as it can result in gangrene.

==Causes==
Paraphimosis is usually caused by medical professionals (iatrogenic) or parents who handle the foreskin improperly. The foreskin may be retracted during penile examination, penile cleaning, urethral catheterization, or cystoscopy; if the foreskin is left retracted for a long period, some of the foreskin tissue may become oedematous (swollen with fluid), which makes subsequent reduction of the foreskin difficult.

==Prevention and treatment==
Paraphimosis can be avoided by bringing the foreskin back into its normal, forward, non-retracted position after retraction is no longer necessary (for instance, after cleaning the glans penis or placing a Foley catheter). Phimosis (both pathologic and normal childhood physiologic forms) is a risk factor for paraphimosis; &quot;physiologic&quot; phimosis resolves naturally as a child matures, but it may be advisable to treat &quot;pathologic&quot; phimosis via long-term stretching or elective surgical techniques (such as preputioplasty to loosen the preputial orifice or circumcision to amputate the foreskin tissue partially or completely).

The foreskin responds to the application of tension to cause expansion by creating new skin cells though the process of mitosis. The tissue expansion is permanent. Non-surgical stretching of the foreskin may be used to widen a narrow, non-retractable foreskin. Stretching may be combined with the use of a corticosteroid cream. Beaugé recommends manual stretching for young males in preference to circumcision as a treatment for non-retractile foreskin because of the preservation of sexual sensation.

Paraphimosis can often be effectively treated by manual manipulation of the swollen foreskin tissue. This involves compressing the glans penis and moving the foreskin back to its normal position, perhaps with the aid of a lubricant, cold compression, and local anesthesia as necessary. If this fails, the tight edematous band of tissue can be relieved surgically with a dorsal slit, or a circumcision. An alternative method, the Dundee technique, entails placing multiple punctures in the swollen foreskin with a fine needle, and then expressing the edema fluid by manual pressure. According to Ghory and Sharma, treatment by circumcision may be elected as &quot;a last resort, to be performed by a urologist&quot;. Other experts recommend delaying elective circumcision until after paraphimosis has been resolved. A non-invasive method is the application of granulated sugar to induce transfer of the hypotonic fluid out of the edematous tissue towards the wet sugar via osmotic gradient, to reduce swelling and enabling manual reduction.

<doc id="195205" wikidata="Q7649683" url="?curid=195205" title="Sustainable management">
<text>Sustainable management takes the concepts from sustainability and synthesizes them with the concepts of management. Sustainability has three branches: the environment, the needs of present and future generations, and the economy. Using these branches, it creates the ability of a system to thrive by maintaining economic viability and also nourishing the needs of the present and future generations by limiting resource depletion. 

Sustainable management is needed because it is an important part of the ability to successfully maintain the quality of life on our planet. Sustainable management can be applied to all aspects of our lives. For example, the practices of a business should be sustainable if they wish to stay in businesses, because if the business is unsustainable, then by the definition of sustainability they will cease to be able to be in competition. Communities are in a need of sustainable management, because if the community is to prosper, then the management must be sustainable. Forest and natural resources need to have sustainable management if they are to be able to be continually used by our generation and future generations. Our personal lives also need to be managed sustainably. This can be by making decisions that will help sustain our immediate surroundings and environment, or it can be by managing our emotional and physical well-being. Sustainable management can be applied to many things, as it can be applied as a literal and an abstract concept. Meaning, depending on what they are applied to the meaning of what it is can change.

== History ==
Managers&#x27; strategies reflect the mindset of the times. This being the case, it has been a problem for the evolution of sustainable management practices for two reasons. The first reason is that sustainable norms are continually changing. For example, things considered unthinkable a few years ago are now standard practices. And the second reason is that in order to practice sustainable management, one has to be forward thinking, not only in the short term, but also in the long term.
Management behavior is a reflection of how accepted conceptions of behavior are defined. This means that forces and beliefs outside of the given program push along the management. The manager can take some credit for the cultural changes in his or her program, but overall the organization’s culture reflects dominant conceptions of the public at that time. This is exemplified through the managerial actions taken during the time periods that lead up to the present day. These examples are given below:

* Industrial environmentalism (1960–1970)

This was a time period in which, even though there were outside concerns about the environment, the industries were able to resist pressures and make their own definitions and regulations. Environmentalists were not viewed as credible sources of information during this time and usually discredited.
* Regulatory environmentalism (1970–1982)
The norms of this period radically shifted with the creating of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA became the mediator between the environmentalists and the industry, although the two sides never met. During this period, the environment for the majority of industry and business management teams was only important in terms of compliance with law. 
In 1974 a conference board survey found that the majority of companies still treated environmental management as a threat. The survey noted a widespread tendency in most of industry to treat pollution control expenditures as non-recoverable investments. According to the consensus environmental protection was considered at best a necessary evil, and at worst a temporary nuisance. 
* Environmentalism as social responsibility (1982–1988)
By 1982, the EPA had lost its credibility, but at the same time activism became more influential, and there was an increase in the funding and memberships of major non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Industry gradually became more cooperative with government and new managerial structures were implemented to achieve compliances with regulations. 
* Strategic environmentalism (1988–1993)
During this period, industry progressed into a proactive stance on environmental protection. With this attitude, the issue became one in which they felt qualified to manage on their own. Although there was advancement in organizational power, the concern for the environment still kept being pushed down the hierarchy of important things to do. 
*Environmental management as an opportunity (Since 1993)
In 1995 Harvard professor Michael Porter wrote in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; that environmental protection was not a threat to the corporate enterprise but rather an opportunity, one that could increase competitive advantage in the marketplace.
Before 2000, The companies generally regarded green buildings as interesting experiments but unfeasible projects in the real business world. 
Since then several factors, including the ones listed below, have caused major shifts in thinking. 
The creation of reliable building rating and performance measurement systems for new construction and renovation has helped change corporate perceptions about green. In 2000, the Washington D.C.–based United States Green Building Council launched its rigorous Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.
Hundreds of US and international studies have proven the financial advantages of going green: lower utility costs, higher employee productivity.
Green building materials, mechanical systems, and furnishings have become more widely available, and prices have dropped considerably.
As changes are made to the norms of what is acceptable from a management perspective, more and more it becomes apparent that sustainable management is the new norm of the future. Currently, there are many programs, organizations, communities, and businesses that follow sustainable management plans. These new entities are pressing forward with the help of changing social norms and management initiatives.

== Management position ==
A manager is a person that is held responsible for the planning of things that will benefit the situation that they are controlling. To be a manager of sustainability, one needs to be a manager that can control issues and plan solutions that will be sustainable, so that what they put into place will be able to continue for future generations. The job of a sustainable manager is like other management positions, but additionally they have to manage systems so that they are able to support and sustain themselves. Whether it is a person that is a manager of groups, business, family, communities, organizations, agriculture, or the environment, they can all use sustainable management to improve their productivity, environment, and atmosphere, among other things. Some practical skills that are needed to be able to perform the job include: 
* Seeing problems/issues
* Being able to set goals/agendas
* Planning Skills
* Creating new ways of doing things (thinking outside the box)
* Taking action when it is needed
* Organizational skills
* Being able to teach, make aware, and train people
* Ability to make tough decisions
* Keeping track of progress
* Taking responsibility
* Ability to project current issues/ideas/plans into the Future
* Possessing whole systems thinking

Recently, there has even been the addition of new programs in colleges and universities in order to be able to offer Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Sustainable management.

== Business ==
In business, time and time again, environmentalists are seen facing off against industry, and there is usually very little &quot;meeting in the middle&quot; or compromises. When these two sides agree to disagree, the result is a more powerful message, and it becomes one that allows more people to understand and embrace.

Organizations need to face the fact that the boundaries of accountability are moving fast. The trend towards sustainable management means that organizations are beginning to implement a systems wide approach that links in the various parts of the business with the greater environment at large.

As sustainable management institutions adapt, it becomes imperative that they include an image of sustainable responsibility that is projected for the public to see. This is because firms are socially based organizations. But this can be a double edged sword, because sometimes they end up focusing too much on their image rather than actually focusing on implementing what they are trying to project to the public; this is called green washing. It is important that the execution of sustainable management practices is not put aside while the firm tries to appeal to the public with their sustainable management “practices.”

Additionally, companies must make the connection between sustainability as a vision and sustainability as a practice. Managers need to think systematically and realistically about the application of traditional business principles to environmental problems. By melding the two concepts together, new ideas of business principles emerge and can enable some companies-those with the right industry structure, competitive position, and managerial skills- to deliver increased value to shareholders while making improvements in their environmental performance. 
Any corporation can become green on a standard budget. 
By focusing on the big picture, a company can generate more savings and better performance. By using planning, design, and construction based on sustainable values, sustainable management strives to gain LEED points by reducing footprint of the facility by sustainably planning the site with focus on these three core ideas. To complete a successful green building, or business, the management also applies cost benefit analysis in order to allocate funds appropriately.

=== Business economics ===
The economic system, like all systems, is subject to the laws of thermodynamics, which define the limit at which the Earth can successfully process energy and wastes. Managers need to understand that their values are critical factors in their decisions. Many of current business values are based on unrealistic economic assumptions; adopting new economic models that take the Earth into account in the decision-making process is at the core of sustainable management. This new management addresses the interrelatedness of the ecosystem and the economic system.

The strategic vision that is based on core values of the firm guides the firm’s decision-making processes at all levels. Thus, the sustainable management requires finding out what business activities fit into the Earth’s carrying capacity, and also defining the optimal levels of those activities. Sustainability values form the basis of the strategic management, process the costs and benefits of the firm’s operations, and are measured against the survival needs of the planets stakeholders. Sustainability is the core value because it supports a strategic vision of firms in the long term by integrating economic profits with the responsibility to protect the whole environment.

=== Service model ===
Changing industrial processes so that they actually replenish and magnify the stock of natural capital is another component of sustainable management. One way managers have figured out how to do this is by using a service model of business. 
This focuses on building relationships with customers, instead of focusing on making and selling products. This type of model represents a fundamental change in the way businesses behave. It allows for managers to be aware of the lifecycle of their products by leaving the responsibility up to the company to take care of the product throughout the life cycle. The service model, because the product is the responsibility of the business, creates an avenue in which the managers can see ways in which they can reduce the use of resources through recycling and product construction.

== Communities ==
For communities to be able to improve, sustainable management needs to be in practice. If a community relies on the resources that are in the surrounding area, then they need to be used in a sustainable manner to insure the indefinite supply of the resources. A community needs to work together to be able to be productive, and when there is a need to get things done, management needs to take the lead. If sustainable management is in practice in a community, then people will want to stay in that community, and other people will realize the success, and they will also want to live in a similar environment, as their own unsustainable towns fail. Part of a sustainable management system in a community is the education, the cooperation, and the responsiveness of the people that live in the community.

There are new ideals to how a community can be sustainable. This can include urban planning, which allow people to move about a city that are more sustainable for the environment. If management plans a community that allows for people to move without cars, it helps make a community sustainable by increasing mass transit or other modes of transportation. People would spend less time in traffic while improving the environment, and on an occasions exercise.

Sustainable management provides plans that can improve multiple parts of people lives, environment, and future generations. If a community sets goals, then people are more likely to reduce energy, water, and waste, but a community cannot set goals unless they have the management in place to set goals.

A part of sustainable management for a community is communicating the ideals and plans for an area to the people that will be carrying out the plan. It is important to note that sustainable management is not sustainable if the person that is managing a situation is not communicating what needs to be improved, how it should be improved, why it is important to them, and how they are involved it in the process.

== Personal life ==
For a person to be responsible for their action is a part of managing, and that is part of being managed sustainable. To be able to manage oneself sustainable there are many factors to consider, because to be able to manage oneself a person needs to be able to see what they are doing unsustainable, and how to become sustainable. By using plastic bags at a check out line is unsustainable because it creates pollutants, but using reusable biodegradable bags can resolve the problem. This is not only environmentally sustainable, but it also improves the physical and mental sustainability of the person that uses the reusable bags. It is physical improvement because people do not have to live with the countless plastic bags on the Earth and the pollution that comes with it. It is also an improvement to mental sustainability, because the person that uses the reusable bags has feeling of accomplishment that comes from doing the right thing. Deciding to buy local food to make the community stronger through community sustainable management, can also be emotionally, environmentally, and physically rewarding.

In Figure 1 Mckenzie shows how a person can look at a behavior that they are doing and determine if it is sustainable or not, and what they could replace the bad behavior with. Education of an individual would be the first step to deciding to take a step towards managing their lives sustainable. To manage a person life the benefits needs to be high and the barriers low. Good managing would come up with a competing behavior that has no barriers to it. To come up with a Competing behavior that does not have a barrier to it would involve good problem solving. 

Figure 2 Mckenzie is an example of what a person might try to change in their life to make it more sustainable. Walking instead of taking the taxi helps the environment, but it also loses time spent with family. The bus is in the middle of walking and taking a taxi, but another option that is not on the list is riding a bike. Good sustainable management would include all the options that are possible, and new options that were not available before. These figures are tools that can be used in helping people manage their lives sustainably, but there are other ways to think about their lives to become more sustainable. 
== Forests ==
There are very practical needs for sustainable management of forest. Since forests provide many as per as resources to the people, and to the world, management of the forests are critical to keep those resources available. To be able to manage a forest, knowledge of how the natural systems work is needed. If a manager knows how the natural system works, then when manager of the forest makes plans how the resources are to remove from the forest, the manager will know how the resources can be removed without damaging the forest. Since many forests are under management of the government that is in the region, the forest are not truly functioning how the ecosystem was naturally developed, and how it is meant to be. An example is the pine flatwoods in Florida. To be able to maintain that ecosystem frequent burnings of the forest needs to happen. Fires are a natural part of the ecosystem, but since wild fires can spread to communities near the forest, control of the wild fires is requested from the communities. To maintain flatwoods forest control burning or prescribe burning is part of the management to sustain the forest.

<doc id="195207" wikidata="Q192398" url="?curid=195207" title="Pleural cavity">
<text>The pleural cavity, or pleural space (or sometimes intrapleural space), is the potential space between the pleurae of the pleural sac that surrounds each lung. A small amount of serous pleural fluid is maintained in the pleural cavity to enable lubrication between the membranes, and also to create a pressure gradient.

The serous membrane that covers the surface of the lung is the visceral pleura and is separated from the outer membrane, the parietal pleura, by just the film of pleural fluid in the pleural cavity. The visceral pleura follows the fissures of the lung and the root of the lung structures. The parietal pleura is attached to the mediastinum, the upper surface of the diaphragm, and to the inside of the ribcage.

==Structure==
In humans, the left and right lungs are completely separated by the mediastinum, and there is no communication between their pleural cavities. Therefore, in cases of a unilateral pneumothorax, the contralateral lung will remain functioning normally unless there is a tension pneumothorax, which may shift the mediastinum and the trachea, kink the great vessels, and eventually collapse the contralateral cardiopulmonary circulation.

The visceral pleura receives its blood supply from the parenchymal capillaries of the underlying lung, which have input from both the pulmonary and the bronchial circulation. The parietal pleura receives its blood supply from whatever structures underlying it, which can be branched from the aorta (intercostal, superior phrenic, and inferior phrenic arteries), the internal thoracic (pericardiacophrenic, anterior intercostal, and musculophrenic branches), or their anastomosis.

The visceral pleurae are innervated by splanchnic nerves from the pulmonary plexus, which also innervates the lungs and bronchi. The parietal pleurae however, like their blood supplies, receive nerve supplies from different sources. The costal pleurae (including the portion that bulges above the thoracic inlet) and the periphery of the diaphragmatic pleurae are innervated by the intercostal nerves from the enclosing rib cage, which branches off from the T1-T12 thoracic spinal cord. The mediastinal pleurae and central portions of the diaphragmatic pleurae are innervated by the phrenic nerves. which branches off the C3-C5 cervical cord. Only the parietal pleurae contain somatosensory nerves and are capable of perceiving pain.

===Development===
During the third week of embryogenesis, each lateral mesoderm splits into two layers. The dorsal layer joins the overlying somites and ectoderm to form the somatopleure; and the ventral layer joins the underlying endoderm to form the splanchnopleure. The dehiscence of these two layers creates a fluid-filled cavity on each side, and with the ventral infolding and the subsequent midline fusion of the trilaminar disc, forms a pair of intraembryonic coeloms anterolaterally around the gut tube during the fourth week, with the splanchnopleure on the inner cavity wall and the somatopleure on the outer cavity wall.

The cranial end of the intraembryonic coeloms fuse early to form a single cavity, which rotates invertedly and apparently &quot;descends&quot; in front of the thorax, and is later encroached by the growing primordial heart as the pericardial cavity. The caudal portions of the coeloms fuse later below the umbilical vein to become the larger peritoneal cavity, separated from the pericardial cavity by the transverse septum. The two cavities communicate via a slim pair of remnant coeloms adjacent to the upper foregut called the pericardioperitoneal canal. During the fifth week, the developing lung buds begin to invaginate into these canals, creating a pair of enlarging cavities that encroach into the surrounding somites and further displace the transverse septum caudally — namely the pleural cavities. The mesothelia pushed out by the developing lungs arise from the splanchnopleure, and become the visceral pleurae; while the other mesothelial surfaces of the pleural cavities arise from the somatopleure, and become the parietal pleurae.

The tissue separating the newly formed pleural cavities from the pericardial cavity are known as the &quot;pericardiopleural membranes&quot;, which later become the side walls of the fibrous pericardium. The transverse septum and the displaced somites fuse to form the &quot;pleuroperitoneal membranes&quot;, which separates the pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity and later becomes the diaphragm.

==Function==
The pleural cavity, with its associated pleurae, aids optimal functioning of the lungs during breathing. The pleural cavity also contains pleural fluid, which acts as a lubricant and allows the pleurae to slide effortlessly against each other during respiratory movements. Surface tension of the pleural fluid also leads to close apposition of the lung surfaces with the chest wall. This relationship allows for greater inflation of the alveoli during breathing. The pleural cavity transmits movements of the ribs muscles to the lungs, particularly during heavy breathing. During inhalation the external intercostals contract, as does the diaphragm. This causes the expansion of the chest wall, that increases the volume of the lungs. A negative pressure is thus created and inhalation occurs.

===Pleural fluid===
Pleural fluid is a serous fluid produced by the serous membrane covering normal pleurae. Most fluid is produced by the exudation in parietal circulation (intercostal arteries) via bulk flow and reabsorbed by the lymphatic system. Thus, pleural fluid is produced and reabsorbed continuously. The composition and volume is regulated by mesothelial cells in the pleura. In a normal 70 kg human, a few milliliters of pleural fluid is always present within the intrapleural space. Larger quantities of fluid can accumulate in the pleural space only when the rate of production exceeds the rate of reabsorption. Normally, the rate of reabsorption increases as a physiological response to accumulating fluid, with the reabsorption rate increasing up to 40 times the normal rate before significant amounts of fluid accumulate within the pleural space. Thus, a profound increase in the production of pleural fluid—or some blocking of the reabsorbing lymphatic system—is required for fluid to accumulate in the pleural space.

==Pleural fluid circulation==
The hydrostatic equilibrium model, viscous flow model and capillary equilibrium model are the three hypothesised models of circulation of pleural fluid.

According to the viscous flow model, the intra pleural pressure gradient drives a downward viscous flow of pleural fluid along the flat surfaces of ribs. The capillary equilibrium model states that the high negative apical pleural pressure leads to a basal-to-apical gradient at the mediastinal pleural surface, leading to a fluid flow directed up toward the apex (helped by the beating heart and ventilation in lungs). Thus the recirculation of fluid occurs. Finally there is a traverse flow from margins to flat portion of ribs completes the fluid circulation.

Absorption occurs into lymphatic vessels at the level of the diaphragmatic pleura.

==Clinical significance==

===Pleural effusion===
A pathologic collection of pleural fluid is called a pleural effusion. Mechanisms:
# Lymphatic obstruction
# Increased capillary permeability
# Decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure
# Increased capillary venous pressure
# Increased negative intrapleural pressure

Pleural effusions are classified as exudative (high protein) or transudative (low protein). Exudative pleural effusions are generally caused by infections such as pneumonia (parapneumonic pleural effusion), malignancy, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis or coccidioidomycosis, collagen vascular diseases, and other inflammatory states. Transudative pleural effusions occur in congestive heart failure (CHF), cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome.

Localized pleural fluid effusion noted during pulmonary embolism (PE) results probably from increased capillary permeability due to cytokine or inflammatory mediator release from the platelet-rich thrombi.

===Pleural fluid analysis===
When accumulation of pleural fluid is noted, cytopathologic evaluation of the fluid, as well as clinical microscopy, microbiology, chemical studies, tumor markers, pH determination and other more esoteric tests are required as diagnostic tools for determining the causes of this abnormal accumulation. Even the gross appearance, color, clarity, and odor can be useful tools in diagnosis. The presence of heart failure, infection, or malignancy within the pleural cavity are the most common causes that can be identified using this approach.

====Gross appearance====
* Clear straw-colored: If transudative, no further analysis needed. If exudative, additional studies needed to determine cause (cytology, culture, biopsy).
* Cloudy, purulent, turbid: Infection, empyema, pancreatitis, malignancy.
* Pink to red/bloody: Traumatic tap, malignancy, pulmonary infarction, intestinal infarction, pancreatitis, trauma.
* Green-white, turbid: Rheumatoid arthritis with pleural effusion.
* Green-brown: Biliary disease, bowel perforation with ascites.
* Milky-white or yellow and bloody: Chylous effusion.
* Milky or green, metallic sheen: Pseudochylous effusion.
* Viscous (hemorrhagic or clear): Mesothelioma.
* Anchovy-paste (or &#x27;chocolate sauce&#x27;): Ruptured amoebic liver abscess.

====Microscopic appearance====
Microscopy may show resident cells (mesothelial cells, inflammatory cells) of either benign or malignant etiology. Evaluation by a cytopathologist is then performed and a morphologic diagnosis can be made. Neutrophils are numerous in pleural empyema. If lymphocytes predominate and mesothelial cells are rare, this is suggestive of tuberculosis. Mesothelial cells may also be decreased in cases of rheumatoid pleuritis or post-pleurodesis pleuritis. Eosinophils are often seen if a patient has recently undergone prior pleural fluid tap. Their significance is limited.

If malignant cells are present, a pathologist may perform additional studies including immunohistochemistry to determine the etiology of the malignancy.

====Chemical analysis====
Chemistry studies may be performed including pH, pleural fluid:serum protein ratio, LDH ratio, specific gravity, cholesterol level, and bilirubin level. These studies may help clarify the etiology of a pleural effusion (exudative vs transudative). Amylase may be elevated in pleural effusions related to gastric/esophageal perforations, pancreatitis, or malignancy. Pleural effusions are classified as exudative (high protein) or transudative (low protein).

In spite of all the diagnostic tests available today, many pleural effusions remain idiopathic in origin. If severe symptoms persist, more invasive techniques may be required. In spite of the lack of knowledge of the cause of the effusion, treatment may be required to relieve the most common symptom, dyspnea, as this can be quite disabling. Thoracoscopy has become the mainstay of invasive procedures as closed pleural biopsy has fallen into disuse.

===Disease===

Diseases of the pleural cavity include:
* Pneumothorax: a collection of air within the pleural cavity
* Pleural effusion: a fluid accumulation within the pleural space
* Pleural tumors: abnormal growths on the pleurae
* Tumor-like disorders of the lung pleura

<doc id="195211" wikidata="Q2280426" url="?curid=195211" title="Shuntō">
<text>is a Japanese term, usually translated as &quot;spring wage offensive.&quot; It refers to the annual wage negotiations between enterprise unions and the employers in Japan. Beginning in February or March each spring, thousands of unions conduct wage negotiations with employers simultaneously.

&quot;Shuntō&quot; was first carried out in 1954, at the suggestion of Kaoru Ōta, the newly-installed vice chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sōhyō). &quot;Shuntō&quot; was a response to the structural weakness of the Japanese labor movement; rather than organizing by industry, Japanese labor unions were &quot;enterprise unions&quot; organized on a company-by-company basis. This made any particular union reluctant to strike for higher wages and better working conditions, for fear that rival companies would simply snap up market share during the stoppage. Ōta&#x27;s innovation was to schedule a specific date in the spring when all Sōhyō unions everywhere would agree to go on strike all at once. Since the &quot;shuntō&quot; was scheduled in advance, labor and management had ample time to work out a deal. By ameliorating labor strife and avoiding economic uncertainty, this system suited both workers and employers, and rapidly spread throughout Japan, becoming an enduring feature of Japanese industrial relations. By the 1960s, &quot;shuntō&quot; was regularly securing workers large annual wage increases, in line with or even exceeding Japan&#x27;s high-speed economic growth. The Trade Union Confederation (Sōhyō, later succeeded by RENGO) customarily set a specific target percentage increase, the &quot;base-up,&quot; for the annual wage increases to aid with collective bargaining. Negotiations for enterprise unions tended to begin after the bigger unions had secured their own deals and so they could push for their own company to match the improvements, which led to economy-wide wage increases. According to economist Ryotaro Takahashi, &quot;The ripple effect of wage determination through the spring offensive is considerable. The average increase in wages in the annual spring offensive also spreads to unorganised small- and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, the wages of the employees in government and government-affiliated corporations are raised through the National Personnel Authority (NPA) recommendation system, which is also influenced by the results of the spring offensive. The wages of part-timers and micro-enterprises are affected by the increase in the minimum wages by region.&quot;

In recent years, Japan has suffered from a number of recessions and deflation, and union membership has been falling, causing the value of the &quot;shuntō&quot; and the automatic wage increases associated with it to come under threat. Major unions in the steel, electronics, and automotive industries have been forced to reduce their demands and, in some years, even accept no increase in wages from employers. Simply protecting existing pay structures and jobs has often become the primary concern. In this context, criticism has arisen that &quot;shuntō&quot; has become little more than a ritual or ceremonial performance of labor militancy, lacking in efficacy.

<doc id="195212" wikidata="Q207776" url="?curid=195212" title="Girondins">
<text>The Girondins (, ), also called Girondists, were a political group during the French Revolution. From 1791 to 1793, the Girondins were active in the Legislative Assembly and the National Convention. Together with the Montagnards, they initially were part of the Jacobin movement. They campaigned for the end of the monarchy, but then resisted the spiraling momentum of the Revolution, which caused a conflict with the more radical Montagnards. They dominated the movement until their fall in the insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793, which resulted in the domination of the Montagnards and the purge and eventual mass execution of the Girondins. This event is considered to mark the beginning of the Reign of Terror.

The Girondins were a group of loosely affiliated individuals rather than an organized political party and the name was at first informally applied because the most prominent exponents of their point of view were deputies to the Legislative Assembly from the département of Gironde in southwest France. Girondin leader Jacques Pierre Brissot proposed an ambitious military plan to spread the Revolution internationally, therefore the Girondins were the war party in 1792–1793. Other prominent Girondins included Jean Marie Roland and his wife Madame Roland. They also had an ally in the English-born American activist Thomas Paine.

Brissot and Madame Roland were executed and Jean Roland (who had gone into hiding) committed suicide when he learned about the execution. Paine was imprisoned, but he narrowly escaped execution. The famous painting &quot;The Death of Marat&quot; depicts the fiery radical journalist and denouncer of the Girondins Jean-Paul Marat after being stabbed to death in his bathtub by Charlotte Corday, a Girondin sympathizer. Corday did not attempt to flee and was arrested and executed.

== Identity ==
The collective name &quot;Girondins&quot; is used to describe &quot;a loosely knit group of French deputies who contested the Montagnards for control of the National Convention&quot;. They were never an formal organization or political party. The name itself was bestowed not by any of its alleged members but by the Montagnards, &quot;who claimed as early as April 1792 that a counterrevolutionary faction had coalesced around deputies of the department of the Gironde&quot;. Jacques-Pierre Brissot, Jean Marie Roland and François Buzot were among the most prominent of such deputies and contemporaries called their supporters &quot;Brissotins&quot;, &quot;Rolandins&quot;, or &quot;Buzotins&quot;, depending on which politician was being blamed for their leadership. Other names were employed at the time too, but &quot;Girondins&quot; ultimately became the term favored by historians. The term became standard with Alphonse de Lamartine&#x27;s &quot;History of the Girondins&quot; in 1847.

== History ==
=== Rise ===

Twelve deputies represented the département of the Gironde and there were six who sat for this département in both the Legislative Assembly of 1791–1792 and the National Convention of 1792–1795. Five were lawyers: Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud, Marguerite-Élie Guadet, Armand Gensonné, Jean Antoine Laffargue de Grangeneuve and Jean Jay (who was also a Protestant pastor). The other, Jean François Ducos, was a tradesman. In the Legislative Assembly, they represented a compact body of opinion which, though not as yet definitely republican (i.e. against the monarchy), was considerably more &quot;advanced&quot; than the moderate royalism of the majority of the Parisian deputies.

A group of deputies from elsewhere became associated with these views, most notably the Marquis de Condorcet, Claude Fauchet, Marc David Lasource, Maximin Isnard, the Comte de Kersaint, Henri Larivière and above all Jacques Pierre Brissot, Jean Marie Roland and Jérôme Pétion, who was elected mayor of Paris in succession to Jean Sylvain Bailly on 16 November 1791.

Madame Roland, whose salon became their gathering place, had a powerful influence on the spirit and policy of the Girondins with her &quot;romantic republicanism&quot;. The party cohesion they possessed was connected to the energy of Brissot, who came to be regarded as their mouthpiece in the Assembly and in the Jacobin Club, hence the name &quot;Brissotins&quot; for his followers. The group was identified by its enemies at the start of the National Convention (20 September 1792). &quot;Brissotins&quot; and &quot;Girondins&quot; were terms of opprobrium used by their enemies in a separate faction of the Jacobin Club, who freely denounced them as enemies of democracy.

=== Foreign policy ===
In the Legislative Assembly, the Girondins represented the principle of democratic revolution within France and patriotic defiance to the European powers. They supported an aggressive foreign policy and constituted the war party in the period 1792–1793, when revolutionary France initiated a long series of revolutionary wars with other European powers. Brissot proposed an ambitious military plan to spread the Revolution internationally, one that Napoleon later pursued aggressively. Brissot called on the National Convention to dominate Europe by conquering the Rhineland, Poland and the Netherlands with a goal of creating a protective ring of satellite republics in Great Britain, Spain and Italy by 1795. The Girondins also called for war against Austria, arguing it would rally patriots around the Revolution, liberate oppressed peoples from despotism, and test the loyalty of King Louis XVI.

=== Montagnards versus Girondins ===

Girondins at first dominated the Jacobin Club, where Brissot&#x27;s influence had not yet been ousted by Maximilien Robespierre and they did not hesitate to use this advantage to stir up popular passion and intimidate those who sought to stay the progress of the Revolution. They compelled the king in 1792 to choose a ministry composed of their partisans, among them Roland, Charles François Dumouriez, Étienne Clavière and Joseph Marie Servan de Gerbey; and they forced a declaration of war against Habsburg Austria the same year. In all of this activity, there was no apparent line of cleavage between &quot;La Gironde&quot; and The Mountain. Montagnards and Girondins alike were fundamentally opposed to the monarchy; both were democrats as well as republicans; and both were prepared to appeal to force in order to realise their ideals. Despite being accused of wanting to weaken the central government (&quot;federalism&quot;), the Girondins desired as little as the Montagnards to break up the unity of France. From the first, the leaders of the two parties stood in avowed opposition, in the Jacobin Club as in the Assembly.

Temperament largely accounts for the dividing line between the parties. The Girondins were doctrinaires and theorists rather than men of action. They initially encouraged armed petitions, but then were dismayed when this led to the &quot;émeute&quot; (riot) of 20 June 1792. Jean-Marie Roland was typical of their spirit, turning the Ministry of the Exterior into a publishing office for tracts on civic virtues while riotous mobs were burning the châteaux unchecked in the provinces. Girondins did not share the ferocious fanaticism or the ruthless opportunism of the future Montagnard organisers of the Reign of Terror. On 25 July, according to the &quot;Logographe&quot;, Carnot promoted the use of pikes (seven feet long) and provided to every citizen. (On this day the points of view between Robespierre and Brissot split.) On 29 July Robespierre called for the deposition of the King and the election of a Convention. Early August Brissot urged the preservation of the constitution, advocating against both the dethronement of the king and the election of a new assembly. As the Revolution developed, the Girondins often found themselves opposing its results; the overthrow of the monarchy on 10 August 1792 and the September Massacres of 1792 occurred while they still nominally controlled the government, but the Girondins tried to distance themselves from the results of the September Massacres. At the end of August Robespierre was no longer willing to cooperate with Brissot and Roland. On Sunday morning 2 September the members of the Commune, gathering in the town hall to proceed the election of deputies to the National Convention, decided to maintain their seats and have Roland and Brissot arrested. According to Charlotte Robespierre, her brother stopped talking to his former friend, mayor Pétion de Villeneuve. Pétion was accused of conspicuous consumption by Desmoulins, and finally rallied to Brissot. 

When the National Convention first met on 22 September 1792, the core of like-minded deputies from the Gironde expanded as Jean-Baptiste Boyer-Fonfrède, Jacques Lacaze and François Bergoeing joined five of the six stalwarts of the Legislative Assembly (Jean Jay, the Protestant pastor, drifted toward the Montagnard faction). Their numbers were increased by the return to national politics by former National Constituent Assembly deputies such as Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne, Pétion de Villeneuve and Kervélégan, as well as some newcomers as the writer Thomas Paine and popular journalist Jean-Louis Carra. The Girondins called on the local authorities to oppose the concentration and centralisation of power.

=== Decline and fall ===
The Girondins proposed suspending the king and summoning of the National Convention, but they agreed not to overthrow the monarchy until Louis XVI became impervious to their counsels. Once the king was overthrown in 1792 and a republic was established, they were anxious to stop the revolutionary movement that they had helped to set in motion. Girondins and historian Pierre Claude François Daunou argues in his &quot;Mémoires&quot; that the Girondins were too cultivated and too polished to retain their popularity for long in times of disturbance, and so they were more inclined to work for the establishment of order, which would mean the guarantee of their own power. The Girondins, who had been the radicals of the Legislative Assembly (1791–1792), became the conservatives of the Convention (1792–1795).

The Revolution failed to deliver the immediate gains that had been promised and this made it difficult for the Girondins to draw it to a close easily in the minds of the public. Moreover, the &quot;Septembriseurs&quot; (the supporters of the September Massacres such as Robespierre, Danton, Marat and their lesser allies) realised that not only their influence but their safety depended on keeping the Revolution alive. Robespierre, who hated the Girondins, had proposed to include them in the proscription lists of September 1792: The Mountain Club to a man who desired their overthrow. A group including some Girondins prepared a draft constitution known as the Girondin constitutional project, which was presented to the National Convention in early 1793. Thomas Paine was one of the signers of this proposal.

The crisis came in March 1793. The Girondins, who had a majority in the Convention, controlled the executive council and filled the ministries, believed themselves invincible. Their orators had no serious rivals in the hostile camp—their system was established in mere reason, but the Montagnards made up for what they lacked in talent or in numbers through their boldness and energy. This was especially fruitful since uncommitted delegates accounted for almost half the total number, even though the Jacobins and Brissotins formed the largest groups. The more radical rhetoric of the Jacobins attracted the support of the revolutionary Paris Commune, the Revolutionary Sections (mass assemblies in districts) and the National Guard of Paris and they had gained control of the Jacobin club, where Brissot, absorbed in departmental work, had been superseded by Robespierre. At the trial of Louis XVI in 1792, most Girondins had voted for the &quot;appeal to the people&quot; and so laid themselves open to the charge of &quot;royalism&quot;. They denounced the domination of Paris and summoned provincial levies to their aid and so fell under suspicion of &quot;federalism&quot; as on September 25, 1792. They strengthened the revolutionary Commune by first decreeing its abolition but withdrawing the decree at the first sign of popular opposition.

In the suspicious temper of the times, their vacillation was fatal. Marat never ceased his denunciations of the faction by which France was being betrayed to her ruin and his cry of &quot;Nous sommes trahis!&quot; (&quot;We are betrayed!&quot;) was echoed from group to group in the streets of Paris. The growing hostility of Paris to the Girondins received a fateful demonstration by the election on 15 February 1793 of the bitter ex-Girondin Jean-Nicolas Pache to the mayoralty. Pache had twice been minister of war in the Girondins government, but his incompetence had laid him open to strong criticism and on 4 February 1793 he had been replaced as minister of war by a vote of the Convention. This was enough to secure him the votes of the Paris electors when he was elected mayor ten days later. The Mountain was strengthened by the accession of a significant ally whose one idea was to use his new power to avenge himself on his former colleagues. Mayor Pache, with &quot;procureur&quot; of the Commune Pierre Gaspard Chaumette and deputy &quot;procureur&quot; Jacques René Hébert, controlled the armed militias of the 48 revolutionary Sections of Paris and prepared to turn this weapon against the Convention. The abortive &quot;émeute&quot; of 10 March warned the Girondins of their danger and they responded with defensive moves. They unintentionally increased the prestige of their most vocal and bitter critic Marat by prosecuting him before the Revolutionary Tribunal, where his acquittal in April 1793 was a foregone conclusion. The Commission of Twelve was appointed of on 24 May, including the arrest of Varlat and Hébert and other precautionary measures. The ominous threat by Girondin leader Maximin Isnard, uttered on 25 May, to &quot;march France upon Paris&quot; was instead met by Paris marching hastily upon the Convention. The Girondin role in the government was undermined by the popular uprisings of 27 and 31 May and finally on 2 June 1793, when François Hanriot, head of the Paris National Guards, purged the Convention of the Girondins (see Insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793).

=== Reign of Terror ===

A list drawn up by the Commandant-General of the Parisian National Guard François Hanriot (with help from Marat) and endorsed by a decree of the intimidated Convention, included 22 Girondin deputies and 10 of the 12 members of the Commission of Twelve, who were ordered to be detained at their lodgings &quot;under the safeguard of the people&quot;. Some submitted, among them Gensonné, Guadet, Vergniaud, Pétion, Birotteau and Boyer-Fonfrède. Others, including Brissot, Louvet, Buzot, Lasource, Grangeneuve, Larivière and François Bergoeing, escaped from Paris and, joined later by Guadet, Pétion and Birotteau, set to work to organise a movement of the provinces against the capital. This attempt to stir up civil war made the wavering and frightened Convention suddenly determined. On 13 June 1793, it voted that the city of Paris deserved well of the country and ordered the imprisonment of the detained deputies, the filling up of their places in the Assembly by their &quot;suppléants&quot; and the initiation of vigorous measures against the movement in the provinces. The assassination of Marat by Charlotte Corday on 13 July 1793 only served to increase the unpopularity of the Girondins and seal their fate.

The excuse for the Terror that followed was the imminent peril of France, menaced on the east by the advance of the armies of the First Coalition (Austria, Prussia and Great Britain) on the west by the Royalist Revolt in the Vendée and the need for preventing at all costs the outbreak of another civil war. On 28 July 1793, a decree of the Convention proscribed 21 deputies, five of whom were from the Gironde, as traitors and enemies of their country (Charles-Louis Antiboul, Boilleau the younger, Boyer-Fonfrêde, Brissot, Carra, Gaspard-Séverin Duchastel, the younger Ducos, Dufriche de Valazé, Jean Duprat, Fauchet, Gardien, Gensonné, Lacaze, Lasource, Claude Romain Lauze de Perret, Lehardi, Benoît Lesterpt-Beauvais, the elder Minvielle, the Marquis de Sillery, Vergniaud and Louis-François-Sébastien Viger). Those were sent to trial. Another 39 were included in the final &quot;acte d&#x27;accusation&quot;, accepted by the Convention on 24 October 1793, which stated the crimes for which they were to be tried as their perfidious ambition, their hatred of Paris, their &quot;federalism&quot; and above all their responsibility for the attempt of their escaped colleagues to provoke civil war.

=== 1793 trial of Girondins ===

The trial of the 22 began before the Revolutionary Tribunal on 24 October 1793. The verdict was a foregone conclusion. On 31 October, they were borne to the guillotine. It took 36 minutes to decapitate all of them, including Charles Éléonor Dufriche de Valazé, who had committed suicide the previous day upon hearing the sentence he was given.

Of those who escaped to the provinces, after wandering about singly or in groups most were either captured and executed or committed suicide. They included Barbaroux, Buzot, Condorcet, Grangeneuve, Guadet, Kersaint, Pétion, Rabaut de Saint-Etienne and François Rebecqui. Roland killed himself at Rouen on 15 November 1793, a week after the execution of his wife. A very few escaped, including Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvrai, whose &quot;Mémoires&quot; give a detailed picture of the sufferings of the fugitives.

=== Girondins as martyrs ===

The survivors of the party made an effort to re-enter the Convention after the fall of Robespierre on 27 July 1794, but it was not until 5 March 1795 that they were formally re-instated forming the Council of Five Hundred under the Directory. On 3 October of that same year (11 Vendémiaire, year IV), a solemn &quot;fête&quot; in honour of the Girondins, &quot;martyrs of liberty&quot;, was celebrated in the Convention.

In her autobiography, Madame Roland reshapes her historical image by stressing the popular connection between sacrifice and female virtue. Her &quot;Mémoires de Madame Roland&quot; (1795) was written from prison where she was held as a Girondin sympathizer. It covers her work for the Girondins while her husband Jean-Marie Roland was Interior Minister. The book echoes such popular novels as Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Julie or the New Héloise&quot; by linking her feminine virtue and motherhood to her sacrifice in a cycle of suffering and consolation. Roland says her mother&#x27;s death was the impetus for her &quot;odyssey from virtuous daughter to revolutionary heroine&quot; as it introduced her to death and sacrifice—with the ultimate sacrifice of her own life for her political beliefs. She helped her husband escape, but she was executed on 8 November 1793. A week later he committed suicide.

A monument to the Girondins was erected in Bordeaux between 1893 and 1902 dedicated to the memory of the Girondin deputies who were victims of the Terror. The vagueness of who actually made up the Girondins led to the monument not having any names inscribed on it until 1989. Even then, the deputies to the Convention who were memorialized were only those hailing from the Gironde department, omitting notable people like Brissot and Madame Roland.

== Ideology ==
The words Girondin and Montagnard are defined as political groups—more specific definitions are the subject of theorizing by historians. The two words were much tossed about by partisans with various understandings of what they were intended to represent. The two groups lacked formal political structures, and the differences between them have never been satisfactorily explained. It has been suggested that the word Girondin as a useful term be abandoned.

Influenced by classical liberalism and the concepts of freedom, liberty, equality, brotherhood, democracy, human rights, rule of law and Montesquieu&#x27;s separation of powers, the Girondins were republicans, Like the Jacobins, they were also influenced by the writings of David Hume, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

In its early times of government, the Gironde supported a free market – opposing price controls on goods (e.g., a 1793 maximum on grain prices), supported by a constitutional right to public assistance for the poor and public education. With Brissot, they advocated exporting the Revolution through aggressive foreign policies including war against the surrounding European monarchies. The Girondins were also one of the first supporters of abolitionism in France with Brissot leading the anti-slavery Society of the Friends of the Blacks. Certain Girondins such as Condorcet supported women&#x27;s suffrage and political equality.

They sat to the left of the centrist Feuillants. The Girondins supported democratic reform, secularism and parliamentary sovereignty at the expense of a weaker executive and judiciary as opposed to the authoritarian left-wing Montagnards, who supported public acknowledgement of a Supreme Being and a strong executive.

<text>Poisoning the well (or attempting to poison the well) is a type of informal fallacy where adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing something that the target person is about to say. Poisoning the well can be a special case of &quot;argumentum ad hominem&quot;, and the term was first used in this sense by John Henry Newman in his work &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua&quot; (1864).

== Structure ==
Poisoning the well can take the form of an (explicit or implied) argument, and is considered by some philosophers an informal fallacy.

A poisoned-well &quot;argument&quot; has the following form:
# Unfavorable information (be it true or false) about person A is presented by another. Example: &quot;Before you listen to my opponent, may I remind you that he has been in jail.&quot;
# Therefore, the claims made by person A will be false.

Poisoned-well arguments are sometimes used with preemptive invocations of the association fallacy. In this pattern, an unfavorable attribute is ascribed to any future opponents, in an attempt to discourage debate. For example, &quot;That&#x27;s my stance on funding the public education system, and anyone who disagrees with me hates children.&quot; Any person who steps forward to dispute the claim will then risk applying the tag to themselves in the process. This is a false dilemma: not all future opponents necessarily have the unfavorable attribute. For example, not everyone who has a different opinion on funding the public education system necessarily hates children.

A poisoned-well &quot;argument&quot; can also be in this form:
# Unfavorable definitions (be it true or false) that prevent disagreement (or enforce affirmative position).
# Any claims without first agreeing with the above definitions are automatically dismissed.

Example: &quot;Boss, you heard my side of the story, and why I think Bill should be fired and not me. Now, I am sure Bill is going to come to you with some pathetic attempt to weasel out of this lie that he has created.&quot;

<doc id="195216" wikidata="Q382641" url="?curid=195216" title="Phimosis">
<text>Phimosis (from Greek φίμωσις &quot;phimōsis&quot; &#x27;muzzling&#x27;) is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot stretch to allow it to be pulled back past the glans. A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination. In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during an erection, but is otherwise not painful. Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as balanitis, and other complications. 

In infancy, phimosis is considered physiological (normal). At birth, the foreskin is naturally adhered to the glans, and cannot be retracted. As the child ages, in most cases, the foreskin will naturally detach. In young boys, it is normal not to be able to pull back the foreskin at all. Over 90% of cases resolve by the age of seven, although full retraction is still prevented by balanopreputial adhesions in over half at this age. Occasionally, phimosis may be caused by an underlying condition such as scarring due to balanitis or balanitis xerotica obliterans. This can typically be diagnosed by seeing scarring of the opening of the foreskin.
Generally, treatment is not considered necessary unless the foreskin still cannot be retracted by the age of 18. Efforts to pull back the foreskin during the early years of a young male&#x27;s life should not be attempted. For those in whom the condition does not improve further, time can be given or a steroid cream may be used to attempt to loosen the tight skin. If this method, combined with stretching exercises, is not effective, then other treatments such as circumcision may be recommended. A potential complication of phimosis is paraphimosis, where the tight foreskin becomes trapped behind the glans.

==Signs and symptoms==
At birth, the inner layer of the foreskin is sealed to the glans penis. The foreskin is usually non-retractable in early childhood, and some males may reach the age of 18 before their foreskin can be fully retracted.

Medical associations advise not to retract the foreskin of an infant, in order to prevent scarring. Some argue that non-retractability may &quot;be considered normal for males up to and including adolescence.&quot; Hill states that full retractability of the foreskin may not be achieved until late childhood or early adulthood. A Danish survey found that the mean age of first foreskin retraction is 10.4 years.

Rickwood, as well as other authors, has suggested that true phimosis is over-diagnosed due to failure to distinguish between normal developmental non-retractability and a pathological condition. Some authors use the terms &quot;physiologic&quot; and &quot;pathologic&quot; to distinguish between these types of phimosis; others use the term &quot;non-retractile foreskin&quot; to distinguish this developmental condition from pathologic phimosis.

In some cases, a cause may not be clear, or it may be difficult to distinguish physiological phimosis from pathological phimosis if an infant appears to have discomfort while urinating or demonstrates obvious ballooning of the foreskin. However, ballooning does not indicate urinary obstruction.

In women, a comparable condition is known as &quot;clitoral phimosis&quot;, whereby the clitoral hood cannot be retracted, limiting exposure of the glans clitoridis.
===Severity===
* Score 1: full retraction of foreskin, tight behind the glans.
* Score 2: partial exposure of glans, prepuce (not congenital adhesions) limiting factor.
* Score 3: partial retraction, meatus just visible.
* Score 4: slight retraction, but some distance between tip and glans, i.e. neither meatus nor glans can be exposed.
* Score 5: absolutely no retraction of the foreskin.

==Cause==
There are three mechanical conditions that prevent foreskin retraction:

:* The tip of the foreskin is too narrow to pass over the glans penis. This is normal in children and adolescents.
:* The inner surface of the foreskin is fused with the glans penis. This is normal in children and adolescents but abnormal in adults.
:* The frenulum is too short to allow complete retraction of the foreskin (a condition called frenulum breve).
Pathological phimosis (as opposed to the natural non-retractability of the foreskin in childhood) is rare, and the causes are varied. Some cases may arise from balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis).

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (thought to be the same condition as balanitis xerotica obliterans) is regarded as a common (or even the main) cause of pathological phimosis. This is a skin condition of unknown origin that causes a whitish ring of indurated tissue (a cicatrix) to form near the tip of the prepuce. This inelastic tissue prevents retraction.

Phimosis may occur after other types of chronic inflammation (such as balanoposthitis), repeated catheterization, or forcible foreskin retraction.

Phimosis may also arise in untreated diabetics due to the presence of glucose in their urine giving rise to infection in the foreskin.

Beaugé noted that unusual masturbation practices, such as thrusting against the bed or rubbing the foreskin forward, may cause phimosis. Patients are advised to stop exacerbating masturbation techniques and are encouraged to masturbate by moving the foreskin up and down so as to mimic more closely the action of sexual intercourse. After giving this advice Beaugé noted not once did he have to recommend circumcision.

Phimosis in older boys and adult males can vary in severity, with some able to retract their foreskin partially (relative phimosis), while others are completely unable to retract their foreskin, even when the penis is in a flaccid state (full phimosis).

==Treatment==

Physiologic phimosis, common in males 10 years of age and younger, is normal, and does not require intervention. Non-retractile foreskin usually becomes retractable during the course of puberty.

If phimosis in older boys or adult males is not causing acute and severe problems, nonsurgical measures may be effective. Choice of treatment is often determined by whether circumcision is viewed as an option of last resort or as the preferred course.

===Nonsurgical===
* Patients are advised to stop exacerbating masturbation techniques and are encouraged to masturbate by moving the foreskin up and down so as to mimic more closely the action of sexual intercourse. After giving this advice Beaugé noted not once did he have to recommend circumcision.
* Topical steroid creams such as betamethasone, mometasone furoate and cortisone are effective in treating phimosis and should be considered before circumcision. It is theorized that the steroids work by reducing the body&#x27;s inflammatory and immune responses, and also by thinning the skin.
* Gently stretching of the foreskin can be accomplished manually. Skin that is under tension expands by growing additional cells. There are different ways to stretch the phimosis. If the opening of the foreskin is already large enough, the foreskin is rolled over two fingers and these are carefully pulled apart. If the opening is still too small, then specialised foreskin tissue expander balloons and possibly flesh tunnels can be used, however as you can see from the link, these were not designed for the foreskin, rather they are used to stretch the ear lobe. The balloon is easily guided under the foreskin for all grades of phimosis and for all shapes of glans and foreskin combinations. The balloon is made of a very high grade FDA approved medical silicone that prevents micro abrasions and also stays in place due to the unique properties of the balloon. The balloon can be worn for 30 minutes each day whilst undertaking normal activities. Flesh tunnels have only been shown to be mildy effective for lower grades of phimosis and were not designed specifically to treat phimosis. Cheaper grades of flesh tunnels can cause microabrasions and many sizes are required. These are inserted into the foreskin opening and should preferably be made of silicone so that they can be folded when inserted and so that they do not interfere when worn. The diameter is gradually increased until the foreskin can be retracted without difficulty. Even phimosis with a diameter of less than a millimetre can be stretched with these rings. Rings in different sizes are also available as stretching sets. Studies involving treating phimosis using topical steroids in conjunction with stretching exercises have reported success rates of up to 96%. However, other sources claim &quot;wildly variable reported failure rates (5 – 33 %) and lack of follow-up to adulthood.&quot;

===Surgical===

Surgical methods range from the complete removal of the foreskin to more minor operations to relieve foreskin tightness:
* Dorsal slit (superincision) is a single incision along the upper length of the foreskin from the tip to the corona, exposing the glans without removing any tissue.
* Ventral slit (subincision) is an incision along the lower length of the foreskin from the tip of the frenulum to the base of the glans, removing the frenulum in the process. Often used when frenulum breve occurs alongside the phimosis.
* Preputioplasty, in which a limited dorsal slit with transverse closure is made along the constricting band of skin, can be an effective alternative to circumcision. It has the advantage of only limited pain and a short healing duration relative to circumcision, while also avoiding cosmetic effects.
* Circumcision is sometimes performed for phimosis, and is an effective treatment; however, this method has become less common as of 2012.

While circumcision prevents phimosis, studies of the incidence of healthy infants circumcised for each prevented case of phimosis are inconsistent.

==Prognosis==
The most acute complication is paraphimosis. In this condition, the glans is swollen and painful, and the foreskin is immobilized by the swelling in a partially retracted position. The proximal penis is flaccid. Some studies found phimosis to be a risk factor for urinary retention and carcinoma of the penis.

==Epidemiology==
A number of medical reports of phimosis incidence have been published over the years. They vary widely because of the difficulties of distinguishing physiological phimosis (developmental nonretractility) from pathological phimosis, definitional differences, ascertainment problems, and the multiple additional influences on post-neonatal circumcision rates in cultures where most newborn males are circumcised. A commonly cited incidence statistic for pathological phimosis is 1% of uncircumcised males. When phimosis is simply equated with nonretractility of the foreskin after age 3 years, considerably higher incidence rates have been reported.
Others have described incidences in adolescents and adults as high as 50%, though it is likely that many cases of physiological phimosis or partial nonretractility were included.

==History==
According to some accounts, phimosis prevented Louis XVI of France from impregnating his wife, Marie Antoinette, for the first seven years of their marriage, but this theory was later discredited. She was 14 and he was 15 when they married in 1770. However, the presence and nature of his genital anomaly is not considered certain, and some scholars (such as Vincent Cronin and Simone Bertiere) assert that surgical repair would have been mentioned in the records of his medical treatments if this had indeed occurred. Non-retractile prepuce in adolescence is normal, common, and usually resolves with increasing maturity.

US president James Garfield was assassinated by Charles Guiteau in 1881. Guiteau&#x27;s autopsy report indicated that he had phimosis. At the time, this led to the speculation that Guiteau&#x27;s murderous behavior was due to phimosis-induced insanity.

<text>Newgrange () is a prehistoric monument in County Meath in Ireland, located on a rise overlooking the River Boyne, west of the town of Drogheda. It is an exceptionally grand passage tomb built during the Neolithic Period, around 3200 BC, making it older than Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids. Newgrange is the main monument in the Brú na Bóinne complex, a World Heritage Site that also includes the passage tombs of Knowth and Dowth, as well as other henges, burial mounds and standing stones.

Newgrange consists of a large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and cruciform chamber. Burnt and unburnt human bones, and possible grave goods or votive offerings, were found in this chamber. The monument has a striking façade made mostly of white quartz cobblestones, and it is ringed by engraved kerbstones. Many of the larger stones of Newgrange are covered in megalithic art. The mound is also ringed by a stone circle. Some of the material that makes up the monument came from as far as the Mournes and Wicklow Mountains. There is no agreement about its purpose, but it is believed it had religious significance. It is aligned so that the rising sun on the winter solstice shines through a &quot;roofbox&quot; above the entrance and floods the inner chamber. Several other passage tombs in Ireland are aligned with solstices and equinoxes, and Cairn G at Carrowkeel has a similar &quot;roofbox&quot;. Newgrange shares similarities with some other Neolithic monuments in Western Europe; especially Gavrinis in Brittany, which has a similar preserved facing and large carved stones, Maeshowe in Orkney, with its large corbelled chamber, and Bryn Celli Ddu in Wales.

Its initial period of use lasted about 1,000 years. Newgrange then gradually became a ruin, although the area continued to be a site of ritual activity. It featured in Irish mythology and folklore, in which it is said to be a dwelling of the deities, particularly The Dagda and his son Aengus. Antiquarians first began its study in the seventeenth century, and archaeological excavations began in the twentieth century. Archaeologist Michael J. O&#x27;Kelly led the most extensive of these from 1962 to 1975 and also reconstructed the front of the monument, a reconstruction that is controversial. This included an inward-curving dark stone wall to ease visitor access. Newgrange is a popular tourist site and, according to archaeologist Colin Renfrew, is &quot;unhesitatingly regarded by the prehistorian as the great national monument of Ireland&quot; and as one of the most important megalithic structures in Europe.

== Description ==

===Mound and passage===
The Newgrange monument primarily consists of a large mound, built of alternating layers of earth and stones, with grass growing on top and a reconstructed facade of flattish white quartz stones studded at intervals with large rounded cobbles covering part of the circumference. It consists of about 200,000 tonnes of material. The mound is wide at its widest point and high, and covers of ground. Within the mound is a chambered passage, which may be accessed by an entrance on the southeastern side of the monument. The passage stretches for 19 metres (60 ft), or about a third of the way into the centre of the structure. At the end of the passage are three small chambers off a larger central chamber with a high corbelled vault roof. Each of the smaller chambers has a large flat &quot;basin stone&quot; where the bones of the dead may have been deposited during prehistoric times. Whether it was a burial site remains unclear. The walls of this passage are made up of large stone slabs called orthostats, twenty-two of which are on the western side and twenty-one on the eastern side. They average 1½ metres in height; several are decorated with carvings (as well as graffiti from the period after the rediscovery). The orthostats decrease in height the further into the passageway as a result of the passage being slightly graded from being constructed on the rise of a hill. The ceiling shows no evidence of smoke.

===Standing stones===
Situated around the perimeter of the mound is a circle of standing stones. Twelve standing-stones survive out of a possible original thirty-five. Most archaeologists suggest that they were added later, during the Bronze Age, centuries after the original monument had been abandoned as a ritual centre. This view is disputed and relates to a carbon date from a standing stone setting that intersects with a later timber post circle, the theory being, that the stone in question could have been moved and later, re-set in its original position.

===Art===
Newgrange contains various examples of graphic Neolithic rock art carved onto its stone surfaces. These carvings fit into ten categories, five of which are curvilinear (circles, spirals, arcs, serpentiniforms, and dot-in-circles) and the other five of which are rectilinear (chevrons, lozenges, radials, parallel lines, and offsets). They are marked by wide differences in style, the skill-level needed to produce them, and on how deeply carved they are. One of the most notable types of art at Newgrange are the triskele-like features found on the entrance stone. It is approximately three metres long and 1.2 metres high (10 ft long and 4 ft high), and about five tonnes in weight. It has been described as &quot;one of the most famous stones in the entire repertory of megalithic art.&quot; Archaeologists believe that most of the carvings were produced prior to the stones being erected, although the entrance stone was carved in situ before the kerbstones were placed alongside it.

Various archaeologists have speculated as to the meanings of the designs, with some, such as George Coffey (in the 1890s), believing them to be purely decorative, whilst others, such as O&#x27;Kelly, believed them to have some sort of symbolic purpose, because some of the carvings had been in places that would not have been visible, such as at the bottom of the orthostatic slabs below ground level. Extensive research on how the art relates to alignments and astronomy in the Boyne Valley complex was carried out by American-Irish researcher, Martin Brennan.

==Early history==

The Neolithic people who built the monument were native agriculturalists, growing crops and raising animals such as cattle in the area where their settlements were located.

===Construction===
The original complex of Newgrange was built between c. 3200 and 3100 BC. According to carbon-14 dates, it is approximately 500 years older than the current form of Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, as well as predating the Mycenaean culture of ancient Greece. Some put its period of construction somewhat later, at 3000 to 2500 BC. Geological analysis indicates that the thousands of pebbles that make up the cairn, which together would have weighed about 200,000 tonnes, came from the nearby river terraces of the Boyne. There is a large pond in this area that is believed to be the site quarried for the pebbles by the builders of Newgrange. Most of the 547 slabs that make up the inner passage, chambers, and the outer kerbstones are greywacke. Some or all of them may have been brought from sites approximately 5 km away, from the rocky beach at Clogherhead, County Louth, about 20 km to the northeast. The facade and entrance were built with white quartz cobblestones from the Wicklow Mountains, about 50 km to the south; dark rounded granodiorite cobbles from the Mourne Mountains, about 50 km to the north; dark gabbro cobbles from the Cooley Mountains; and banded siltstone from the shore at Carlingford Lough. The stones may have been transported to Newgrange by sea and up the River Boyne by fastening them to the underside of boats at low tide. None of the structural slabs were quarried, for they show signs of having been weathered naturally, so they must have been collected and then transported, largely uphill, to the Newgrange site. The granite basins found inside the chambers also came from the Mournes.

Frank Mitchell suggested that the monument could have been built within a space of five years, basing his estimation upon the likely number of local inhabitants during the Neolithic and the amount of time they could have devoted to building it rather than farming. This estimate, however, was criticised by Michael J. O&#x27;Kelly and his archaeological team, who believed that it would have taken a minimum of thirty years to build.

===Burials===
Excavations have revealed deposits of both burnt and unburnt human bone in the passage, indicating human corpses had been placed within it, some of whom had been cremated. From examining the unburnt bone, it was shown to come from at least two separate individuals, but much of their skeletons were missing, and what was left had been scattered about the passage. Various grave goods were deposited alongside the bodies inside the passage. Excavations that took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s revealed seven &quot;marbles&quot;, four pendants, two beads, a used flint flake, a bone chisel, and fragments of bone pins and points. Many more artifacts had been found in the passage in previous centuries by visiting antiquarians and tourists, although most of these were removed and went missing or held in private collections. Nonetheless, sometimes these were recorded and it is believed that the grave goods that came from Newgrange were typical of Neolithic Irish passage grave assemblages. The remains of animals also have been found in the structure, primarily those of mountain hares, rabbits, and dogs, but also of bats, sheep, goats, cattle, song thrushes, and more rarely, molluscs and frogs. Most of these animals would have entered and died in the chamber many centuries or even millennia after it was constructed: for instance, rabbits were only introduced to Ireland in the thirteenth century.

DNA analysis found that bones deposited in the most elaborate chamber belonged to a man whose parents were first-degree relatives, possibly brother and sister. In history, such inbreeding was usually only found in royal dynasties headed by &quot;god-kings&quot;, such as the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, who married among themselves to keep the royal bloodline &quot;pure&quot;. This, together with the prestige of the burial, could mean that a similar elite group were responsible for building Newgrange, and that it was a royal tomb. The man was distantly related to people buried in the Carrowkeel and Carrowmore tombs. However, archaeologist Alasdair Whittle said that social difference in the Neolithic was often short-lived, speculating that an elite may have arisen temporarily in response to crisis. He suggested that Newgrange may have been a communal monument at certain times and co-opted as a personal tomb for brief periods.

===Purpose===

There have been various debates as to its original purpose. Many archaeologists believed that the monument had religious significance of some sort or another, either as a place of worship for a &quot;cult of the dead&quot; or for an astronomically based faith. O&#x27;Kelly believed that the monument had to be seen in relation to the nearby Knowth and Dowth, and that the building of Newgrange &quot;cannot be regarded as other than the expression of some kind of powerful force or motivation, brought to the extremes of aggrandizement in these three monuments, the cathedrals of the megalithic religion.&quot; O&#x27;Kelly believed that Newgrange, alongside the hundreds of other passage tombs built in Ireland during the Neolithic, showed evidence for a religion that venerated the dead as one of its core principles. He believed that this &quot;cult of the dead&quot; was just one particular form of European Neolithic religion, and that other megalithic monuments displayed evidence for different religious beliefs that were solar-oriented, rather than ancestor-oriented.

Studies in other fields of expertise offer alternative interpretations of the possible functions, however, which principally centre on the astronomy, engineering, geometry, and mythology associated with the Boyne monuments. It is speculated that the sun formed an important part of the religious beliefs of the Neolithic people who built it. One idea was that the room was designed for a ritualistic capturing of sun rays on the shortest day of the year, the winter solstice, as the room gets flooded with sunlight, which might have signaled that the days would start to get longer again. This view is strengthened by the discovery of alignments in Knowth, Dowth, and the Lough Crew Cairns leading to the interpretation of these monuments as calendrical or astronomical devices.

Once a year, at the Winter Solstice, the rising sun shines directly along the long passage, illuminating the inner chamber and revealing the carvings inside, notably the triple spiral on the front wall of the chamber. This illumination lasts for approximately 17 minutes. Michael J. O&#x27;Kelly was the first person in modern times to observe this event on 21 December 1967. The sunlight enters the passage through a specially contrived opening, known as a roofbox, directly above the main entrance. Although solar alignments are not uncommon among passage graves, Newgrange is one of few to contain the additional roofbox feature. (Cairn G at Carrowkeel Megalithic Cemetery is another, and it has been suggested that one can be found at Bryn Celli Ddu.) The alignment is such that although the roofbox is above the passage entrance, the light hits the floor of the inner chamber. Today the first light enters about four minutes after sunrise and strikes the middle of the chamber, but calculations based on the precession of the Earth show that 5,000 years ago, first light would have entered exactly at sunrise and shone on the chamber&#x27;s back wall. The solar alignment at Newgrange is very precise compared to similar phenomena at other passage graves such as Dowth or Maes Howe in the Orkney Islands, off the coast of Scotland.

During much of the Neolithic period, the Newgrange area continued to be a focus of some ceremonial activity.

===Bronze Age and Iron Age===
By the onset of the Bronze Age, it appears that Newgrange was no longer being used by the local population, who did not leave any artifacts in the structure or bury their dead there. O&#x27;Kelly stated, &quot;by 2000 [BC] Newgrange was in decay and squatters were living around its collapsing edge&quot;. These people were adherents of the Beaker culture, which had been imported from mainland Europe, and made Beaker-style pottery locally. A large timber circle (or henge) was built to the southeast of the main mound and a smaller timber circle to the west. The eastern timber circle consisted of five concentric rows of pits. The outer row contained wooden posts. The next row of pits had clay linings and was used to burn animal remains. The three inner rows of pits were dug to accept the animal remains. Within the circle were post and stake holes associated with Beaker pottery and flint flakes. The western timber circle consisted of two concentric rows of parallel postholes and pits defining a circle in diameter. A concentric mound of clay was constructed around the southern and western sides of the mound that covered a structure consisting of two parallel lines of post and ditches that had been partly burnt. A free-standing circle of large stones was raised around the Newgrange mound. Near the entrance, seventeen hearths were used to set fires. These structures at Newgrange are generally contemporary with a number of henges known from the Boyne Valley, at Newgrange Site A, Newgrange Site O, Dowth Henge, and Monknewtown Henge.
The site evidently continued to have some ritual significance into the Iron Age. Among various objects later deposited around the mound are two pendants made from gold Roman coins of 320–337 AD (now in the National Museum of Ireland) and Roman gold jewellery including two bracelets, two finger rings, and a necklace, now in the collections of the British Museum.

The culture that built Newgrange is sometimes confused with the much later Celtic culture, and designs on the stones are misdescribed as &quot;Celtic&quot;. However, recent archaeogenetics suggests that the west European neolithic population was largely replaced by later arrivals.

==Mythology==

In Irish mythology, Newgrange is often called &quot;Síd in Broga&quot; (modern &quot;Sídhe an Brugha&quot; or &quot;Sí an Bhrú&quot;). Like other passage tombs, it is described as a portal to the Otherworld and a dwelling of the divine Tuatha Dé Danann.

In one tale the Dagda, the chief god, desires Boann, the goddess of the River Boyne. She lives at Brú na Bóinne with her husband Elcmar. The Dagda impregnates her after sending Elcmar away on a one-day errand. To hide the pregnancy from Elcmar, the Dagda casts a spell on him, making &quot;the sun stand still&quot; so he will not notice the passing of time. Meanwhile, Boann gives birth to Aengus, who is also known as Maccán Óg (&quot;the young son&quot;). Eventually, Aengus learns that the Dagda is his true father and asks him for a portion of land. In some versions of the tale, the Dagda helps Aengus take ownership of the Brú from Elcmar. Aengus asks to have the Brú for &quot;a day and night&quot;, but then claims it forever, because all time is made up of &quot;day and night&quot;. Other versions have Aengus taking over the Brú from the Dagda himself by using the same trick. The Brú is then named &quot;Brug maic ind Óig&quot; after him. In &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne&quot;, Aengus takes Diarmuid&#x27;s body to the Brú.

It has been suggested that this tale represents the winter solstice illumination of Newgrange, during which the sunbeam (the Dagda) enters the inner chamber (the womb of Boann) when the sun&#x27;s path stands still. The word &quot;solstice&quot; (Irish &quot;grianstad&quot;) means sun-standstill. The conception of Aengus may represent the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the sun at the winter solstice, him taking over the Brú from an older god representing the growing sun taking over from the waning sun. This could mean that knowledge of the event survived for thousands of years before being recorded as a myth in the Middle Ages. John Carey, an expert on Irish mythology, says that the tales of Brú na Bóinne are the only Irish legends where a sacred site is linked with the control of time.

There is a similar tale about Dowth (&quot;Dubhadh&quot;), one of the other Boyne Valley tombs. It tells how king Bresal compels the men of Ireland to build a tower to heaven within a day. His sister casts a spell, making the sun stand still so that one day lasts indefinitely. However, Bresal commits incest with his sister, which breaks the spell. The sun sets and the builders leave, hence the name &quot;Dubhadh&quot; (&quot;darkening&quot;). This tale has also been linked with recent DNA analysis, which found that a man buried at Newgrange had parents who were most likely siblings (see #Construction and burials).

Newgrange is described in some myths as &quot;white-topped&quot;, &quot;brilliant to approach&quot;, and &quot;chequered with many lights&quot;. Archaeologist Claire O&#x27;Kelly wrote that these could be &quot;references to the glistening white quartz of the Newgrange mound&quot;.

Local folklore about Newgrange survived into the modern era.

==Modern history==
Sometime after 1142 the structure became part of outlying farmland owned by the Cistercian Abbey of Mellifont. These farms were referred to as &quot;granges&quot;. Newgrange is not mentioned in any of the early charters of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but an &quot;&quot; granted by Edward III in 1348 includes a &quot;Nova Grangia&quot; among the demesne lands of the abbey.

===Antiquarianism in the 17th and 18th centuries===

In 1699, the local landowner, Williamite settler Charles Campbell, ordered some of his farm labourers to dig up a part of Newgrange, which then had the appearance of a large mound of earth, so that he could collect stone from within it. The labourers soon discovered the entrance to the tomb within the mound, and a Welsh antiquarian named Edward Lhwyd, who was staying in the area, was alerted and took an interest in the monument. He wrote an account of the mound and its tomb, describing what he saw as its &quot;barbarous sculpture&quot; and noting that animal bones, beads, and pieces of glass had been found inside of it (modern archaeologists have speculated that these latter two were in fact the polished pottery beads that subsequently have been found at the site and that were a common feature of Neolithic tombs). Soon another antiquarian visitor, Sir Thomas Molyneux, professor at Trinity College Dublin, also came to the site. He talked to Charles Campbell, who informed him that he had found the remains of two human corpses in the tomb, one (which was male) in one of the cisterns and another farther along the passageway, something that Lhwyd had not noted. Subsequently, Newgrange was visited by a number of antiquarians, who often performed their own measurements of the site and made their own observations, which often were published in various antiquarian journals; these included such figures as Sir William Wilde, Thomas Pownall, Thomas Wright, John O&#x27;Donovan, George Petrie, and James Ferguson.

These antiquarians often concocted their own theories about the origins of Newgrange, many of which have since been proved incorrect. Thomas Pownall conducted a very detailed survey of New Grange in 1769, which numbers all the stones and also records some of the carvings on the stone and asserted that the mound originally had been taller and a lot of the stone on top of it had been removed, a theory that has been disproven by archaeological research. The majority of these antiquarians also refused to believe that it was ancient peoples native to Ireland who built the monument, with many believing that it had been built in the early medieval period by invading Vikings, whilst others speculated that it had been built by the ancient Egyptians, ancient Indians, or the Phoenicians.

At some time in the early 1800s, a folly was built a few yards behind Newgrange. The folly, with two circular windows, was made of stones taken from Newgrange.

===Conservation, archaeological investigation and reconstruction===

In 1882, under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act, Newgrange and the nearby monuments of Knowth and Dowth were placed under the control of the state with the Board of Public Works being the responsible administrative authority. In 1890, under the leadership of Thomas Newenham Deane, the board began a project of conservation of the monument, which had been damaged through general deterioration over the previous three millennia as well as the increasing vandalism caused by visitors, some of whom had inscribed their names on the stones. In subsequent decades, a number of archaeologists performed excavations at the site, discovering more about its function and how it had been built; however, even at the time, it was still mistakenly believed by archaeologists to be built during the Bronze Age rather than during the earlier Neolithic period. For 60 years in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Annie (d. 1964) and Bob Hickey looked after Newgrange as caretakers, custodians and tour guides following his appointment c. 1890. They spoke of noticing a shaft of sunlight hitting a particular stone inside during the winter equinox in December. In the 1950s, electric lighting was installed in the passageway to allow visitors to see more clearly.

The first thorough archaeological investigation and excavation of Newgrange was undertaken from 1962 through to 1975, led by Irish archaeologist Michael J. O&#x27;Kelly. Following the O&#x27;Kelly excavation, conservation, restoration and reconstruction works took place, based on the archaeological findings. His excavation report was published in 1982 by Thames and Hudson as &quot;Newgrange: Archaeology, Art and Legend&quot;.

A dense layer of white quartz stones, mingled with grey cobbles, was found lying at the front of the mound. O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s team carefully recorded the stratigraphy. The quartz layer was thickest nearest the kerbstones, and none was found underneath any of the kerbstones that had fallen or tilted outward from the mound. This indicated that the quartz had fallen or slipped down from above the kerbstones. O&#x27;Kelly concluded that the quartz had made up a white façade or revetment on the front of the monument. The archaeologists also found what they believed to be the bottom course of a revetment, still in place above three kerbstones at the back of the mound. The height of the original façade was calculated as being up to 3 meters tall by civil engineer John Fogarty of University College Cork, an expert on the movement of piled-up loose materials. Fogarty and O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s team tested their theory by building and collapsing a façade made of the same kind of quartz and cobble stones. O&#x27;Kelly wrote that the resulting stratigraphy was almost identical to that found in the excavations.

As part of the restoration, this white quartz façade was rebuilt, and a concrete support wall built behind it in case of a future cairn collapse. This work is controversial among the archaeological community. P. R. Giot described the façade as looking like a &quot;cream cheese cake with dried currants distributed about&quot;. Neil Oliver described the reconstruction as &quot;a bit brutal, a bit overdone, kind of like Stalin does the Stone Age&quot;. Some critics claim that the Neolithic builders did not have the technology to build a revetment at this angle.

Other archaeologists have supported O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s conclusions and the reconstructed façade, such as Robert Hensey and Elizabeth Shee Twohig in their paper &quot;Facing the cairn at Newgrange&quot; (2017), where they set forth the archaeological evidence. They also contend that if the builders quarried and brought the quartz such a distance, they likely would have used it to &quot;maximum effect&quot; as a striking façade, rather than laying it on the ground where it could barely be seen. Along with archaeologist Carleton Jones, Hensey and Twohig note that passage tombs in Brittany have similar near-vertical dry stone fronts, such as Gavrinis and Barnenez.

The inward-curving dark stone walls on each side of the entrance are not original, nor are they meant to suggest Newgrange&#x27;s original appearance. They were designed solely to facilitate visitor access. One visitor guide book to the site, however, mistakenly had a drawing showing the modern entrance as if it were part of Newgrange&#x27;s original appearance.

In 2016, archaeologist Michael Gibbons controversially claimed that the roofbox, which captures the winter solstice sunlight, was &quot;fabricated&quot; by O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s team. This claim was refuted by several prominent Irish archaeologists, including Prof William O&#x27;Brien and Ann Lynch, who noted that it has been recorded photographically since the early 1900s, and in detailed site drawings from the excavation.

==Access==
Newgrange is located west of Drogheda in County Meath. The interpretive centre is located on the south bank of the river and Newgrange is located on the north side of the river. Access is only from the interpretive centre.

Access to Newgrange is by guided tour only. Tours begin at the Brú na Bóinne Visitor Centre from which visitors are taken to the site in groups. Current-day visitors to Newgrange are treated to a guided tour and a re-enactment of the Winter Solstice experience through the use of high-powered electric lights situated within the tomb. The finale of a Newgrange tour results in every visitor standing inside the tomb where the tour guide then turns off the lights, and then turns on ones simulating the sunlight that would appear on the winter solstice.

To experience the phenomenon on the morning of the Winter Solstice from inside Newgrange, visitors to Bru Na Bóinne Visitor Centre must enter an annual lottery at the centre. Of the tens of thousands who enter, sixty are chosen each year. Winners are permitted to bring a single guest. The winners are split into groups of ten and taken in on the five days around the solstice in December when sunlight can enter the chamber, weather permitting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the 2020 and 2021 events were exclusively live-streamed with no public access.

<text>Voskhod 1 () was the seventh crewed Soviet space flight. Flown by cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov, Konstantin Feoktistov, and Boris Yegorov, it launched 12 October 1964, and returned on the 13th. Voskhod 1 was the first human spaceflight to carry more than one crewman into orbit, the first flight without the use of spacesuits, and the first to carry either an engineer or a physician into outer space. It also set a crewed spacecraft altitude record of .

The three spacesuits for the Voskhod 1 cosmonauts were omitted; there was neither the room nor the payload capacity for the Voskhod to carry them. The original Voskhod had been designed to carry two cosmonauts, but Soviet politicians pushed the Soviet space program into squeezing three cosmonauts into Voskhod 1. The only other space flight in the short Voskhod program, Voskhod 2, carried two suited cosmonauts – of necessity, because it was the flight on which Alexei Leonov made the world&#x27;s first walk in space.

As part of its payload Voskhod 1 carried a ribbon off a Communard banner from the Paris Commune of 1871 into orbit.

==Background==

The original prime crew of cosmonauts for Voskhod 1, composed of Boris Volynov, Georgi Katys, and Boris Yegorov, was rejected just three days before the scheduled launch date for the space capsule. Katys was reportedly removed after the KGB discovered that his father had been shot during the Great Purge in 1937 and Volynov apparently was the victim of discrimination due to his part-Jewish background, although he would later fly on Soyuz 5 and Soyuz 21.

Politics played a role in the crew&#x27;s selection. Various factions each supported their own representatives for the flight. Sergei Korolev wanted his engineers to become cosmonauts, believing that spacecraft designers should fly in their own vehicles. The Soviet Air Force agreed to a crew composed of a military pilot, an engineer or scientist, and a doctor, but advocated for an all-military crew. Konstantin Feoktistov, who had been a design engineer for the Vostok, Voskhod, and Soyuz programs, was selected for this flight, becoming the only Soviet outer space designer to make a spaceflight. Yegorov, a medical doctor, used his political influence to get selected for the crew through his father&#x27;s Politburo connections. The Soviet space program viewed its crews as passengers more than pilots; the new cosmonauts received only three to four months of training, perhaps the briefest in space history other than that received by the American politicians Jake Garn and Bill Nelson for Space Shuttle flights in the 1980s.

==Mission highlights==

The Voskhod spacecraft were basically Vostok spacecraft with a backup solid-fuel retrorocket added onto the top of the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok cosmonaut&#x27;s position. Because of the cramped conditions, the cosmonauts also had to go on a diet to fit in their couches. A solid-fuel braking rocket was also added to the space capsule&#x27;s parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok space capsule, no ejection seats were fitted in the Voskhod; the cosmonauts had to land inside the descent module. Aside from that, the Vostok booster had lacked sufficient payload capacity to support the extra weight of a retrorocket package, but the larger upper stage used on the 11A57 launch vehicle meant that this was no longer an issue. As there was no launch escape system, the mission could not be aborted until three minutes after liftoff when the payload shroud was jettisoned and so a low-altitude booster accident would have meant the loss of the crew.

Liftoff took place at 7:30 on the morning of 12 October. Much of the mission of Voskhod 1 was devoted to biomedical research, and to the study of how a multidisciplinary team could work together in space. The mission was short, at only slightly over 24 hours. Incidentally, the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was removed from power during the spaceflight, and it has been speculated that this led to the mission&#x27;s being cut short. The cramped conditions of the Voskhod space capsule has also been suggested as a factor ruling out a longer-duration spaceflight.

During the flight, Khrushchev spoke with the cosmonauts via radio phone from his &quot;dacha&quot; in the Crimea. Shortly after this conversation, he was summoned back to Moscow where he learned that he was being expelled from office and the Communist Party. When the crew returned to Earth the next day, they were greeted by Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin in their first public appearance as leaders of the Soviet Union.

Despite the propaganda boasting around Voskhod 1, it was privately referred to by the leadership of the Soviet space program as &quot;a circus&quot; due to the messy process of crew selection, the cosmonauts needing to diet to fit inside their spacecraft, Khrushchev&#x27;s expulsion during the flight, and also the extremely dangerous circumstances of it (the crew having neither pressure suits nor any way to escape from a malfunctioning launch vehicle).

Happening as it did before the beginning of the Project Gemini two-man flights, Voskhod 1 had a significant, but temporary, international impact. The NASA Administrator, James E. Webb, called the flight of Voskhod 1 a &quot;significant space accomplishment&quot; adding that it was &quot;a clear indication that the Russians are continuing a large space program for the achievement of national power and prestige.&quot;

== Development ==
The Voskhod 1 mission was the first three-man mission attempted by the USSR. The development for this mission was formally approved on 13 April 1964. This mission used a modified Vostok spacecraft that had been designed for previous manned missions. The modified Vostok spacecraft was renamed Voskhod 1 for the new three-man missions. The Voskhod 1 required many modifications since three cosmonauts had to fit in the capsule that had previously been designed for only one person. Some modifications also had to be made to the 11A57 launch vehicle which was used to launch the Voskhod 1. The first major modification was replacing the one ejection seat with three couches since there were now three cosmonauts. These couches included a suspension system to absorb the shock from launch and landing. Because of space and weight requirements these new seats could not be ejection seats. This resulted in a new parachute mechanism being needed to soft land the entire crew capsule. In addition, the limited space did not allow the cosmonauts to wear pressurized spacesuits and they were only able to wear training suits. This was not a major issue since the crew capsule was pressurized. However, it was less safe because the crew would not survive if the capsule depressurized while in space. In previous missions if the primary retrograde rocket failed the capsule would remain in orbit for 10 days before returning to earth. However, with a crew of three they would not be able to survive for that long. Because of this a backup retrograde rocket was added to deorbit the spacecraft in the event that the primary retrograde rocket failed. In addition to these modifications to Voskhod 1, the third stage of the 11A57 launch vehicle was also changed from the Block Ye to the more powerful Block I. This was done because all the modifications added nearly 600 kilograms of weight to Voskhod 1.

During the development of Voskhod 1 a test of the parachute system was conducted on 6 September 1964. The test was conducted by dropping a Voskhod capsule from an altitude of 10,000 meters. During the test, the hatch for the parachute failed to open. This resulted in the Voskhod capsule crashing without the parachute being deployed. After further testing of the parachute system, it was determined that the electrical circuit that controlled the parachute hatch was the cause of the failure. Because of this, the circuit was redesigned with redundancies of the main components. This resulted in a more reliable circuit. A second test of the Voskhod capsule took place on 5 October 1964. This test resulted in a successful soft landing under a parachute. An unmanned test flight was also conducted on 6 October 1964. For this test, a Voskhod spacecraft was renamed the Kosmos-47 and was put into orbit for one day. Kosmos-47 made a successful soft landing under the parachute. This was the last major test before the actual Voskhod 1 crewed mission. This development concluded with the successful Voskhod 1 mission which launched on 12 October 1964.

<doc id="195220" wikidata="Q503623" url="?curid=195220" title="Gold Coast (British colony)">
<text>The Gold Coast was a British Crown colony on the Gulf of Guinea in West Africa from 1821 until its independence in 1957 as Ghana. The term Gold Coast is also often used to describe all of the four separate jurisdictions that were under the administration of the Governor of the Gold Coast. These were the Gold Coast itself, Ashanti, the Northern Territories protectorate and the British Togoland trust territory.

The first European explorers to arrive at the coast were the Portuguese in 1471. They encountered a variety of African kingdoms, some of which controlled substantial deposits of gold in the soil. In 1483, the Portuguese came to the continent for increased trade. They built the Castle of Elmina, the first European settlement on the Gold Coast. From here they acquired slaves and gold in trade for European goods, such as metal knives, beads, mirrors, rum, and guns. News of the successful trading spread quickly, and British, Dutch, Danish, Prussian and Swedish traders arrived as well. The European traders built several forts along the coastline. The Gold Coast had long been a name for the region used by Europeans because of the large gold resources found in the area. The slave trade was the principal exchange and major part of the economy for many years. In this period, European nations began to explore and colonize the Americas. Soon the Portuguese and Spanish began to export African slaves to the Caribbean, and North and South America. The Dutch and British also entered the slave trade, at first supplying slaves to markets in the Caribbean and on the Caribbean coast of South America.

The Royal Trading Company was established by the British Crown in 1752 and succeeded by the African Company of Merchants, which led British trading efforts into the early 19th century. In 1821, the British government withdrew the company&#x27;s charter and seized privately held lands along the coast, incorporating them into the British Gold Coast colony and taking over the local interests of other European countries. They purchased and incorporated the Danish Gold Coast in 1850 and the Dutch Gold Coast, including Fort Elmina, in 1872. Britain steadily expanded its colony through the invasion and subjection of local kingdoms as well, particularly the Ashanti and Fante confederacies.

The Ashanti people had controlled much of Ghana before Europeans arrived, and were often in conflict with them. In the 21st century they continue to constitute the largest ethnic community in Ghana. Four Anglo-Ashanti Wars were fought between the Ashanti (Asante) and the British, who were sometimes allied with the Fante.

The First Anglo-Ashanti War (1822–24), was fought over an insult to an Ashanti chief. Sergeant Kujo Otetfo of the British Royal African Colonial Corps, during an argument with an Ashanti trader, &quot;grossly abused the King of Ashanti, and it was this insignificant event that provided the spark that set the whole country in a blaze of war&quot;. In the Second Ashanti War (1873–74), the British sacked the Ashanti capital of Kumasi. The Third Ashanti War (1893–94) occurred because the new Ashanti ruler Asantehene wanted to exercise his new title. From 1895 to 1896 the British and Ashanti fought their fourth and final war, in which the Ashanti lost their independence. In 1900, they rebelled in the Ashanti Uprising, but the British suppressed the insurrection and captured the city of Kumasi. The territory of the Ashanti people became a British protectorate on 1 January 1902.

By 1901, the British had established a colony incorporating all of the Gold Coast, with its kingdoms and tribes under a single administration. The British exploited and exported a variety of natural resources: gold, metal ores, diamonds, ivory, pepper, timber, grain and cocoa. The British built railways and a complex transport infrastructure to ship these commodities, which forms the basis for the transport system of modern-day Ghana. 

By 1945, in the wake of a major colonial role in the Second World War, nationalists in the Gold Coast stood up to demand more autonomy, sharing power with Britain from 1951 to 1955. By 1956, British Togoland, the Northern Territories protectorate and the Ashanti protectorate were annexed to the Gold Coast. The Ghana Independence Act 1957 constituted the Gold Coast Crown Colony as part of the new dominion of Ghana.

==History==
===British rule===
By the late 19th century, the British, through conquest or purchase, occupied most of the forts along the coast. Two major factors laid the foundations of British rule and the eventual establishment of a colony on the Gold Coast: British reaction to the Asante wars and the resulting instability and disruption of trade, and Britain&#x27;s increasing preoccupation with the suppression and elimination of the slave trade.

During most of the 19th century, Asante, the most powerful state of the Akan interior, sought to expand its rule and to promote and protect its trade. The first Asante invasion of the coastal regions took place in 1807; the Asante moved south again in the Ga-Fante War of 1811 and in the Ashanti–Akim–Akwapim War of 1814–16. These invasions, though not decisive, disrupted trade in such products as feathers, ivory, rubber and palm oil, and threatened the security of the European forts. Local British, Dutch, and Danish authorities were all forced to come to terms with the Asante. In 1817, the African Company of Merchants signed a treaty of friendship that recognised Asante claims to sovereignty over large areas of the coast and its peoples. The assets of the African Company of Merchants consisted primarily of nine trading posts or factories: Fort William, Fort James, Fort Sekondi, Fort Winneba, Fort Apollonia, Fort Tantumquery, Fort Metal Cross, Fort Komenda, and Cape Coast Castle, the last of which was the administrative centre.

The coastal people, primarily some of the Fante and the inhabitants of the new town of Accra, who were chiefly Ga, came to rely on British protection against Asante incursions. But the merchant companies had limited ability to provide such security. The British Crown dissolved the company in 1821, giving authority over British forts on the Gold Coast to Charles MacCarthy, governor of the colony of Sierra Leone. The British forts and Sierra Leone remained under common administration for the first half of the century. MacCarthy&#x27;s mandate was to impose peace and to end the slave trade. He sought to do this by encouraging the coastal peoples to oppose Kumasi rule and by closing the great roads to the coast. Incidents and sporadic warfare continued, however. In 1824, MacCarthy was killed and most of his force was wiped out in a battle with Asante forces. The British were able to defeat an Asante invasion of the coast in 1826 with a combined force of British and local forces, including the Fante and the people of Accra.
When the British government allowed control of the Gold Coast settlements to revert to the British African Company of Merchants in the late 1820s, relations with Asante were still problematic. From the Asante point of view, the British had failed to control the activities of their local coastal allies. Had this been done, Asante might not have found it necessary to attempt to impose peace on the coastal peoples. MacCarthy&#x27;s encouragement of coastal opposition to Asante and the subsequent 1824 British military attack further indicated to Asante leaders that the Europeans, especially the British, did not respect Asante.

In 1830, a London committee of merchants chose Captain George Maclean to become president of a local council of merchants. Although his formal jurisdiction was limited, Maclean&#x27;s achievements were substantial; for example, he arranged a peace treaty with Asante in 1831. Maclean also supervised the coastal people by holding regular court in Cape Coast, where he sentenced and punished those found guilty of disturbing the peace. Between 1830 and 1843, while Maclean was in charge of affairs on the Gold Coast, no confrontations occurred with Asante. The volume of trade reportedly increased threefold.

Maclean&#x27;s exercise of limited judicial power on the coast was so effective that a parliamentary committee recommended that the British government permanently administer its settlements and negotiate treaties with the coastal chiefs to define Britain&#x27;s relations with them. The government did so in 1843, the same year crown government was reinstated. Commander Henry Worsley Hill was appointed first governor of the Gold Coast. Under Maclean&#x27;s administration, several coastal tribes had submitted voluntarily to British protection. Hill proceeded to define the conditions and responsibilities of his jurisdiction over the protected areas. He negotiated a special treaty with a number of Fante and other local chiefs that became known as the Bond of 1844. This document obliged local leaders to submit serious crimes, such as murder and robbery, to British jurisdiction; it laid the legal foundation for subsequent British colonisation of the coastal area.

Additional coastal states as well as other states farther inland eventually signed the bond, and British influence was accepted, strengthened, and expanded. Under the terms of the 1844 arrangement, the British appeared to provide security to the coastal areas; thus, an informal protectorate came into being. As responsibilities for defending local allies and managing the affairs of the coastal protectorate increased, the administration of the Gold Coast was separated from Sierra Leone in 1850.

At about the same time, growing acceptance of the advantages offered by the British presence led to the initiation of another important step. In April 1852, local chiefs and elders met at Cape Coast to consult with the governor on means of raising revenue. With the governor&#x27;s approval, the council of chiefs constituted itself as a legislative assembly. In approving its resolutions, the governor indicated that the assembly of chiefs should become a permanent fixture of the protectorate&#x27;s constitutional machinery, but the assembly was given no specific constitutional authority to pass laws or to levy taxes without the consent of the people.

In 1872, British influence over the Gold Coast increased further when Britain purchased the Dutch Gold Coast. The Asante, who for years had considered the Dutch at Elmina as their allies, thereby lost their last trade outlet to the sea. To prevent this loss and to ensure that revenue received from that post continued, the Asante staged their last invasion of the coast in 1873. After early successes, they finally came up against well-trained British forces who compelled them to retreat beyond the Pra River. Later attempts to negotiate a settlement with the British were rejected by the commander of their forces, Major General Sir Garnet Wolseley. To settle the Asante problem permanently, the British invaded Asante with a sizeable military force. The attack, launched in January 1874 by 2,500 British soldiers and large numbers of African auxiliaries, resulted in the occupation and burning of Kumasi, the Asante capital.

The subsequent peace treaty required the Asante to renounce any claim to many southern territories. The Asante also had to keep the road to Kumasi open to trade. From this point on, Asante power steadily declined. The confederation slowly disintegrated as subject territories broke away and as protected regions defected to British rule. Enforcement of the treaty led to recurring difficulties and outbreaks of fighting. In 1896, the British dispatched another expedition that occupied Kumasi and forced Asante to become a protectorate of the British Crown. The British abolished the position of &quot;asantehene&quot; and exiled the incumbent from the colony.

The core of the Asante federation accepted these terms grudgingly. In 1900, the Asante rebelled in the War of the Golden Stool but were defeated the next year. In 1902, the British proclaimed Asante a colony under the jurisdiction of the governor of the Gold Coast. The annexation was made with misgivings and recriminations on both sides. With Asante subdued and annexed, British colonisation of the region became a reality.

The British finally succeeded in their earlier plans to abolish slavery and slave trade. In 1874, the British declared all children born to slaves in the Gold Coast Protectorate after 1 January 1875 were born free, thereby introducing a gradual abolition of slavery in line with their policy in India. The British followed up these reforms by banning debt bondage and enslavement by pawning.
However, the British did not enforce these laws, since the indigenous economy was dependent on slave labor and there were little opportunity for vage labor for former slaves; consequently, most slaves were never made aware of the anti-slavery laws, and slave owning and open slave dealing was tolerated until the British officials finally started to enforce the laws in 1911. 
In 1902 it was made illegal to &quot;compel or attempt the compel the services&quot; or another person, but slavery was not explicitly abolished due to British fear that an abolition would cause &quot;internal disorganization&quot;; chattel slavery was formally banned in 1908, but the British authorities did not enforce the law until the 1920s. 
When the Kingdom of Ashanti was conquered by the British in 1896, the British assured the chiefs that they would be allowed to keep their slaves; Asante became a colony in 1901 and in 1902 it was made illegal to &quot;compel or attempt the compel the services&quot; or another person, but slavery was not explicitly abolished due to British fear that an abolition would cause &quot;internal disorganization&quot;; chattel slavery was formally banned in 1908, but the British authorities did not enforce the law until the 1920s.

===Colonialism===
Military confrontations between Asante and the Fante contributed to the growth of British influence on the Gold Coast. It was concern about Asante activities on the coast that had compelled the Fante states to sign the Bond of 1844. In theory, the bond allowed the British quite limited judicial powers—the trying of murder and robbery cases only. Also, the British could not acquire further judicial rights without the consent of the kings, chiefs, and people of the protectorate. In practice, however, British efforts to usurp more and more judicial authority were so successful that in the 1850s they considered establishing European courts in place of traditional African ones.

As a result of the exercise of ever-expanding judicial powers on the coast and also to ensure that the coastal peoples remained firmly under control, the British, following their defeat of Asante in 1874, proclaimed the former coastal protectorate a crown colony. The Gold Coast Colony, established on 24 July 1874, comprised the coastal areas and extended inland as far as the ill-defined borders of Asante.

The coastal peoples did not greet this move with enthusiasm. They were not consulted about this annexation, which arbitrarily set aside the Bond of 1844 and treated its signatories like conquered territories. The British, however, made no claim to any rights to the land, a circumstance that probably explains the absence of popular resistance. Shortly after declaring the coastal area a colony, the British moved the colonial capital from Cape Coast to the former Danish castle at Christiansborg in Accra.
The British sphere of influence was eventually extended to include Asante. Following the defeat of Asante in 1896, the British proclaimed a protectorate over the kingdom. Once the asantehene and his council had been exiled, the British appointed a resident commissioner to Asante, who was given both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the territories. Each Asante state was administered from Kumasi as a separate entity and was ultimately responsible to the governor of the Gold Coast. As noted above, Asante became a colony following its final defeat in 1901.

In the meantime, the British became interested in the broad areas north of Asante, known generally as the Northern Territories. This interest was prompted primarily by the need to forestall the French and the Germans, who had been making rapid advances in the surrounding areas. British officials had first penetrated the area in the 1880s, and after 1896 protection was extended to northern areas whose trade with the coast had been controlled by Asante. In 1898 and 1899, European colonial powers amicably demarcated the boundaries between the Northern Territories and the surrounding French and German colonies. The Northern Territories were proclaimed a British protectorate in 1902.

Like the Asante protectorate, the Northern Territories were placed under the authority of a resident commissioner who was responsible to the governor of the Gold Coast. The governor ruled both Asante and the Northern Territories by proclamations until 1946.

With the north under British control, the three territories of the Gold Coast—the Colony (the coastal regions), Asante, and the Northern Territories—became, for all practical purposes, a single political unit, or crown colony, known as &quot;the dependency&quot; or simply as the Gold Coast. The borders of present-day Ghana were realised in May 1956 when the people of the Volta region, known as British Mandated Togoland, voted in a plebiscite to become part of modern Ghana.

====Colonial administration====

Beginning in 1850, the coastal regions increasingly came under control of the governor of the British fortresses, who was assisted by the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. The Executive Council was a small advisory body of European officials that recommended laws and voted taxes, subject to the governor&#x27;s approval. The Legislative Council included the members of the Executive Council and unofficial members initially chosen from British commercial interests. After 1900 three chiefs and three other Africans were added to the Legislative Council, these being chosen from the Europeanized communities of Accra, Cape Coast, and Sekondi. The inclusion of Africans from Asante and the Northern Territories did not take place until much later. Prior to 1925, all members of the Legislative Council were appointed by the governor. Official members always outnumbered unofficial members.

The gradual emergence of centralised colonial government brought about unified control over local services, although the actual administration of these services was still delegated to local authorities. Specific duties and responsibilities came to be clearly delineated, and the role of traditional states in local administration was also clarified.

The structure of local government had its roots in traditional patterns of government. Village councils of chiefs and elders were almost exclusively responsible for the immediate needs of individual localities, including traditional law and order and the general welfare. The councils, however, ruled by consent rather than by right. Chiefs were chosen by the ruling class of the society; a traditional leader continued to rule not only because he was the choice of what may be termed the nobility, but also because he was accepted by his people. The unseating or destooling of a chief by tribal elders was a fairly common practice if the chief failed to meet the desires or expectations of the community.

Traditional chiefs figured prominently in the system of indirect rule adopted by British authorities to administer their colonies in Africa. According to Frederick Lugard, architect of the policy, indirect rule was cost effective because it reduced the number of European officials in the field. By allowing local rulers to exercise direct administrative control over their people, opposition to European rule from the local population would be minimised. The chiefs, however, were to take instructions from their European supervisors. The plan, according to Lugard, had the further advantage of civilising the natives, because it exposed traditional rulers to the benefits of European political organisation and values. This &quot;civilizing&quot; process notwithstanding, indirect rule had the ultimate advantage of guaranteeing the maintenance of law and order.

The application of indirect rule in the Gold Coast became essential, especially after Asante and the Northern Territories were brought under British rule. Before the effective colonisation of these territories, the intention of the British was to use both force and agreements to control chiefs in Asante and the north. Once indirect rule was implemented, the chiefs became responsible to the colonial authorities who supported them. In many respects, therefore, the power of each chief was greatly enhanced. Although Lugard pointed to the civilising influence of indirect rule, critics of the policy argued that the element of popular participation was removed from the traditional political system. Despite the theoretical argument in favour of decentralisation, indirect rule in practice caused chiefs to look to Accra (the capital) rather than to their people for all decisions.

Many chiefs and elders came to regard themselves as a ruling aristocracy. Their councils were generally led by government commissioners, who often rewarded the chiefs with honours, decorations, and knighthoods. Indirect rule tended to preserve traditional forms and sources of power, however, and it failed to provide meaningful opportunities for the growing number of educated young men anxious to find a niche in their country&#x27;s development. Other groups were dissatisfied because there was not sufficient co-operation between the councils and the central government and because some felt that the local authorities were too dominated by the British district commissioners.

In 1925, provincial councils of chiefs were established in all three territories of the colony, partly to give the chiefs a colony-wide function. This move was followed in 1927 by the promulgation of the Native Administration Ordinance, which replaced an 1883 arrangement that had placed chiefs in the Gold Coast Colony under British supervision. The purpose was to clarify and to regulate the powers and areas of jurisdiction of chiefs and councils. Councils were given specific responsibilities over disputed elections and the unseating of chiefs; the procedure for the election of chiefs was set forth; and judicial powers were defined and delegated. Councils were entrusted with the role of defining customary law in their areas (the government had to approve their decisions), and the provincial councils were empowered to become tribunals to decide matters of customary law when the dispute lay between chiefs in different hierarchies. Until 1939, when the Native Treasuries Ordinance was passed, however, there was no provision for local budgets. In 1935, the Native Authorities Ordinance combined the central colonial government and the local authorities into a single governing system. New native authorities, appointed by the governor, were given wide powers of local government under the supervision of the central government&#x27;s provincial commissioners, who assured that their policies would be those of the central government.

In the year 1948 native Ghanaians decided to fight for their independence.

The provincial councils and moves to strengthen them were not popular. Even by British standards, the chiefs were not given enough power to be effective instruments of indirect rule. Some Ghanaians believed that the reforms, by increasing the power of the chiefs at the expense of local initiative, permitted the colonial government to avoid movement toward any form of popular participation in the colony&#x27;s government.

====Economic and social development in the British colony====
The years of British administration of the Gold Coast during the 20th century were an era of significant progress in social, economic, and educational development. Communications were greatly improved. For example, the Sekondi-Tarkwa railroad, begun in 1898, was extended until it connected most of the important commercial centres of the south, and by 1937, there were 9,700 kilometres of roads. Telecommunication and postal services were initiated as well.

New crops were also introduced and gained widespread acceptance. Cacao trees, introduced in 1878, brought the first cash crop to the farmers of the interior; it became the mainstay of the nation&#x27;s economy in the 1920s when disease wiped out Brazil&#x27;s trees. The production of cocoa was largely in the hands of Africans. The Cocoa Marketing Board was created in 1947 to assist farmers and to stabilise the production and sale of their crop. By the end of that decade, the Gold Coast was exporting more than half of the world&#x27;s cocoa supply.

The colony&#x27;s earnings increased further from the export of timber and gold. Gold, which initially brought Europeans to the Gold Coast, remained in the hands of Africans until the 1890s. Traditional techniques of panning and shaft mining, however, yielded only limited output. The development of modern modes of extracting minerals made gold mining an exclusively foreign-run enterprise. For example, the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, which was organised in 1897, gained a concession of about 160 square kilometres in which to prospect commercially for gold. Although certain tribal authorities profited greatly from the granting of mining concessions, it was the European mining companies and the colonial government that accumulated much of the wealth. Revenue from export of the colony&#x27;s natural resources financed internal improvements in infrastructure and social services. The foundation of an educational system more advanced than any other else in West Africa also resulted from mineral export revenue.

Many of the economic and civil improvements in the Gold Coast in the early part of the current century have been attributed to Frederick Gordon Guggisberg, governor from 1919 to 1927. Born in Galt (near Toronto), Canada, Guggisberg joined the British army in 1889. During the first decade of the 20th century, he worked as a surveyor in the British colonies of the Gold Coast and Nigeria, and later, during World War I, he served in France.

At the beginning of his governorship of the Gold Coast, Guggisberg presented a 10-year development program to the Legislative Council. He suggested first the improvement of transportation. Then, in order of priority, his prescribed improvements included water supply, drainage, hydroelectric projects, public buildings, town improvements, schools, hospitals, prisons, communication lines, and other services. Guggisberg also set a goal of filling half of the colony&#x27;s technical positions with Africans as soon as they could be trained. His program has been described as the most ambitious ever proposed in West Africa up to that time. Another of the governor&#x27;s programs led to the development of an artificial harbour at Takoradi, which then became Ghana&#x27;s first port. Achimota College, which developed into one of the nation&#x27;s finest secondary schools, was also a Guggisberg idea.
When measuring the influence of living standard during the colonial period, the obvious constraint of a long-term perspective is the limited amount of proper data and a consistent measure of human well-being. The anthropometric methods provide a way to overcome the limitations, and reveal the evolution of the long run. Baten drew a long run trend that included the experience of the pre-colonial, colonial and post-independence era. The results indicate that for Ghana, the colonial period of the 20th century was not particularly bad. To be more precise the living standards improved rapidly in the first decade of 20th century when cocoa cultivation took off. In general, the performance of economy and living standard of colonial time shows a better record than the post-independence period. It was through British-style education that a new Ghanaian elite gained the means and the desire to strive for independence. During the colonial years, the country&#x27;s educational institutions improved markedly. From beginnings in missionary schools, the early part of the 20th century saw significant advances in many fields, and, although the missions continued to participate, the government steadily increased its interest and support. In 1909, the government established a technical school and a teachers&#x27; training college at Accra; several other secondary schools were set up by the missions. The government steadily increased its financial backing for the growing number of both state and mission schools. In 1948, the country opened its first centre of higher learning, the University College.

The colony assisted Britain in both World War I and World War II. From 1914 to 1918, the Gold Coast Regiment served with distinction in battles against German forces in Cameroon and in the long East Africa campaign. In World War II, troops from the Gold Coast emerged with even greater prestige after outstanding service in such places as Ethiopia and Burma. In the ensuing years, however, postwar problems of inflation and instability severely hampered readjustment for returning veterans, who were in the forefront of growing discontent and unrest. Their war service and veterans&#x27; associations had broadened their horizons, making it difficult for them to return to the humble and circumscribed positions set aside for Africans by the colonial authorities.(See also Gold Coast in World War II).

===Nationalism===
As the country developed economically, the power gradually shifted from the hands of the governor and his officials into those of Ghanaians. The changes resulted from the gradual development of a strong spirit of nationalism and were to result eventually in independence. The development of national consciousness accelerated quickly after World War II, when, in addition to ex-servicemen, a substantial group of urban African workers and traders emerged to lend mass support to the aspirations of a small educated minority. Once the movement had begun, events moved rapidly—not always fast enough to satisfy the nationalist leaders, but still at a pace that surprised not only the colonial government but many of the more conservative African elements as well.

====Early manifestations====
As early as the latter part of the 19th century, a growing number of educated Africans increasingly found unacceptable an arbitrary political system that placed almost all power in the hands of the governor through his appointment of council members. In the 1890s, some members of the educated coastal elite organised themselves into the Aborigines&#x27; Rights Protection Society to protest a land bill that threatened traditional land tenure. This protest helped lay the foundation for political action that would ultimately lead to independence. In 1920, one of the African members of the Legislative Council, Joseph E. Casely-Hayford, convened the National Congress of British West Africa, which sent a delegation to London to urge the Colonial Office to consider the principle of elected representation. The group, which claimed to speak for all British West African colonies, represented the first expression of political solidarity between intellectuals and nationalists of the area. Even though the delegation was not received in London (on the grounds that it represented only the interests of a small group of urbanised Africans), its actions aroused considerable support among the African elite at home.

Notwithstanding their call for elected representation as opposed to a system whereby the governor appointed council members, these nationalists insisted that they were loyal to the British Crown and that they merely sought an extension of British political and social practices to Africans. Notable leaders included Africanus Horton, Jr.; J. M. Sarbah; and S. R. B. Attah-Ahoma. Such men gave the nationalist movement a distinctly elitist flavour that was to last until the late 1940s.

The constitution of 1925, promulgated by Gordon Guggisberg, created provincial councils of paramount chiefs for all but the northern provinces of the colony. These councils in turn elected six chiefs as unofficial members of the Legislative Council. Although the new constitution appeared to recognise African sentiments, Guggisberg was concerned primarily with protecting British interests. For example, he provided Africans with a limited voice in the central government; yet, by limiting nominations to chiefs, he drove a wedge between chiefs and their educated subjects. The intellectuals believed that the chiefs, in return for British support, had allowed the provincial councils to fall completely under control of the government. By the mid-1930s, however, a gradual rapprochement between chiefs and intellectuals had begun.

Agitation for more adequate representation continued. Newspapers owned and managed by Africans played a major part in provoking this discontent—six were being published in the 1930s. As a result of the call for broader representation, two more unofficial African members were added to the Executive Council in 1943. Changes in the Legislative Council, however, had to await a different political climate in London, which came about only with the postwar election of a British Labour Party government.

The new Gold Coast constitution of 1946 (also known as the Burns constitution after Sir Alan Burns, the governor of the time) was a bold document. For the first time, the concept of an official majority was abandoned. The Legislative Council was now composed of six ex officio members, six nominated members, and eighteen elected members. The 1946 constitution also admitted representatives from Asante into the council for the first time. Even with a Labour Party government in power, however, the British continued to view the colonies as a source of raw materials that were needed to strengthen their crippled economy. Change that would place real power in African hands was not a priority among British leaders until after rioting and looting in Accra and other towns and cities in early 1948 over issues of pensions for ex-servicemen, the dominant role of foreigners in the economy, the shortage of housing, and other economic and political grievances.

With elected members in a decisive majority, Ghana had reached a level of political maturity unequaled anywhere in colonial Africa. The constitution did not, however, grant full self-government. Executive power remained in the hands of the governor, to whom the Legislative Council was responsible. Hence, the constitution, although greeted with enthusiasm as a significant milestone, soon encountered trouble. World War II had just ended, and many Gold Coast veterans who had served in British overseas expeditions returned to a country beset with shortages, inflation, unemployment, and black-market practices. There veterans, along with discontented urban elements, formed a nucleus of malcontents ripe for disruptive action. They were now joined by farmers, who resented drastic governmental measures required to cut out diseased cacao trees to control an epidemic, and by many others who were unhappy that the end of the war had not been followed by economic improvements.

====Politics of the independence movements====
Although political organisations had existed in the British colony, the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) was the first nationalist movement with the aim of self-government &quot;in the shortest possible time&quot;. Founded in August 1947 by educated Africans who included J. B. Danquah, G. A. Grant (known as Paa Grant), R. A. Awoonor-Williams, Eric Ato Nkrumah (all lawyers except for Grant, who was a wealthy businessman), and others, the leadership of the organisation called for the replacement of chiefs on the Legislative Council with educated persons. For these political leaders, traditional governance, exercised largely via indirect rule, was identified with colonial interests and the past. They believed that it was their responsibility to lead their country into a new age. They also demanded that, given their education, the colonial administration should respect them and accord them positions of responsibility. As one writer on the period reported, &quot;The symbols of progress, science, freedom, youth, all became cues which the new leadership evoked and reinforced.&quot; In particular, the UGCC leadership criticised the government for its failure to solve the problems of unemployment, inflation, and the disturbances that had come to characterise the society at the end of the war.

Their opposition to the colonial administration notwithstanding, UGCC members were conservative in the sense that their leadership did not seek drastic or revolutionary change. This was probably a result of their training in the British way of doing things. The manner in which politics were then conducted was to change after Kwame Nkrumah created his Convention People&#x27;s Party (CPP) in June 1949.

Nkrumah was born at Nkroful in the Nzema area and educated in Catholic schools at Half Assini and at Achimota School. He received further training in the United States at Lincoln University and at the University of Pennsylvania. Later, in London, Nkrumah became active in the West African Students&#x27; Union and the Pan-African Congress. He was one of the few Africans who participated in the Fifth Pan-African Congress held in Manchester in 1945. During his time in Britain, Nkrumah came to know such outspoken anti-colonialists and intellectuals as the West Indian George Padmore, and the African-American W. E. B. Du Bois In 1947, when the UGCC was created in the Gold Coast to oppose colonial rule, Nkrumah was invited from London to become the movement&#x27;s general secretary.

Nkrumah&#x27;s tenure with the UGCC was a stormy one. In March 1948, he was arrested and detained with other leaders of the UGCC for political activism. They were known as the Big Six of Ghana Politics. Later, after the other members of the UGCC were invited to make recommendations to the Coussey Committee, which was advising the governor on the path to independence, Nkrumah broke with the UGCC and founded the CPP. Unlike the UGCC call for self-government &quot;in the shortest possible time&quot;, Nkrumah and the CPP asked for &quot;self-government now&quot;. The party leadership, made up of Nkrumah, Kojo Botsio, Komla A. Gbedemah, and a group of mostly young political professionals known as the &quot;Verandah Boys&quot;, identified itself more with ordinary working people than with the UGCC and its intelligentsia.

Nkrumah&#x27;s style and the promises he made appealed directly to the majority of workers, farmers, and youths who heard him; he seemed to be the national leader on whom they could focus their hopes. He also won the support of, among others, influential market women who, through their domination of small-scale trade, served as effective channels of communication at the local level.

The majority of the politicised population, stirred in the postwar years by outspoken newspapers, was separated from both the tribal chiefs and the Anglophile elite nearly as much as from the British by economic, social, and educational factors. This majority consisted primarily of ex-servicemen, literate persons who had some primary schooling, journalists, and elementary school teachers, all of whom had developed a taste for populist conceptions of democracy. A growing number of uneducated but urbanised industrial workers also formed part of the support group. Nkrumah was able to appeal to them on their own terms. By June 1949, when the CPP was formed with the avowed purpose of seeking immediate self-governance, Nkrumah had a mass following.

The constitution of 1951 resulted from the report of the Coussey Committee, created because of disturbances in Accra and other cities in 1948. In addition to giving the Executive Council a large majority of African ministers, it created an assembly, half the elected members of which were to come from the towns and rural districts and half from the traditional councils, including, for the first time, the Northern Territories. Although it was an enormous step forward, the new constitution still fell far short of the CPP&#x27;s call for full self-government. Executive power remained in British hands, and the legislature was tailored to permit control by traditionalist interests.

With increasing popular backing, the CPP in early 1950 initiated a campaign of &quot;positive action&quot;, intended to instigate widespread strikes and nonviolent resistance. When some violent disorders occurred, Nkrumah, along with his principal lieutenants, was promptly arrested and imprisoned for sedition. But this merely increased his prestige as leader and hero of the cause and gave him the status of martyr. In February 1951, the first elections were held for the Legislative Assembly under the new constitution. Nkrumah, still in jail, won a seat, and the CPP won an impressive victory with a two-thirds majority of the 104 seats.

The governor, Sir Charles Arden-Clarke, released Nkrumah and invited him to form a government as &quot;leader of government business&quot;, a position similar to that of prime minister. Nkrumah accepted. A major milestone had been passed on the road to independence and self-government. Nonetheless, although the CPP agreed to work within the new constitutional order, the structure of government that existed in 1951 was certainly not what the CPP preferred. The ministries of defence, external affairs, finance, and justice were still controlled by British officials who were not responsible to the legislature. Also, by providing for a sizeable representation of traditional tribal chiefs in the Legislative Assembly, the constitution accentuated the cleavage between the modern political leaders and the traditional authorities of the councils of chiefs.

The start of Nkrumah&#x27;s first term as &quot;leader of government business&quot; was marked by cordiality and co-operation with the British governor. During the next few years, the government was gradually transformed into a full parliamentary system. The changes were opposed by the more traditionalist African elements, particularly in Asante and the Northern Territories. This opposition, however, proved ineffective in the face of continuing and growing popular support for a single over-riding concept—independence at an early date.

In 1952, the position of prime minister was created and the Executive Council became the cabinet. The prime minister was made responsible to the assembly, which duly elected Nkrumah prime minister. The constitution of 1954 ended the election of assembly members by the tribal councils. The Legislative Assembly increased in size, and all members were chosen by direct election from equal, single-member constituencies. Only defence and foreign policy remained in the hands of the governor; the elected assembly was given control of virtually all internal affairs of the colony.

The CPP pursued a policy of political centralisation, which encountered serious opposition. Shortly after the 1954 election, a new party, the Asante-based National Liberation Movement (NLM), was formed. The NLM advocated a federal form of government, with increased powers for the various regions. NLM leaders criticised the CPP for perceived dictatorial tendencies. The new party worked in co-operation with another regionalist group, the Northern People&#x27;s Party. When these two regional parties walked out of discussions on a new constitution, the CPP feared that London might consider such disunity an indication that the colony was not yet ready for the next phase of self-government.

The British constitutional adviser, however, backed the CPP position. The governor dissolved the assembly to test popular support for the CPP demand for immediate independence. The Crown agreed to grant independence if so requested by a two-thirds majority of the new legislature. New elections were held in July 1956. In keenly contested elections, the CPP won 57 per cent of the votes cast, but the fragmentation of the opposition gave the CPP every seat in the south as well as enough seats in Asante, the Northern Territories, and the Trans-Volta Region to hold a two-thirds majority of the 104 seats.

Prior to the July 1956 general elections in the Gold Coast, a plebiscite was conducted under United Nations (UN) auspices to decide the future disposition of British Togoland and French Togoland. The British trusteeship, the western portion of the former German colony, had been linked to the Gold Coast since 1919 and was represented in its parliament. A clear majority of British Togoland inhabitants voted in favour of union with their western neighbours, and the area was absorbed into the Gold Coast. There was, however, vocal opposition to the incorporation from some of the Ewe in southern British Togoland.

<text>Voskhod 2 () was a Soviet crewed space mission in March 1965. The Vostok-based Voskhod 3KD spacecraft with two crew members on board, Pavel Belyayev and Alexei Leonov, was equipped with an inflatable airlock. It established another milestone in space exploration when Alexei Leonov became the first person to leave the spacecraft in a specialised spacesuit to conduct a 12-minute spacewalk.

==Mission highlights==

Liftoff took place at 07:00 GMT on 18 March 1965. As with Voskhod 1, a launch abort was not possible during the first few minutes, until the payload shroud jettisoned around the -minute mark.

The Voskhod 3KD spacecraft had an inflatable airlock extended in orbit. Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov donned a Berkut spacesuit and left the spacecraft while the other cosmonaut of the two-man crew, Pavel Belyayev, remained inside. Leonov began his spacewalk 90 minutes into the mission at the end of the first orbit. Cosmonaut Leonov&#x27;s spacewalk lasted 12 minutes and 9 seconds (08:34:51–08:47:00 GMT), beginning over north-central Africa (northern Sudan/southern Egypt), and ending over eastern Siberia.

The Voskhod 2 spacecraft was a Vostok spacecraft with a backup, solid fuel retrorocket, attached atop the descent module. The ejection seat was removed and two seats were added, (at a 90° angle relative to the Vostok crew seat position). An inflatable exterior airlock was also added to the descent module opposite the entry hatch. After use, the airlock was jettisoned. There was no provision for crew escape in the event of a launch or landing emergency. A solid fuel braking rocket was also added to the parachute lines to provide for a softer landing at touchdown. This was necessary because, unlike the Vostok, the crew landed with the Voskhod descent module.

Though Leonov was able to complete his spacewalk successfully, both that task and the overall mission were plagued with problems. Leonov&#x27;s only tasks were to attach a camera to the end of the airlock to record his spacewalk and to photograph the spacecraft. He managed to attach the camera without any problem. However, when he tried to use the still camera on his chest, the suit had ballooned and he was unable to reach down to the shutter switch on his leg. After his 12 minutes and 9 seconds outside the Voskhod, Leonov found that his suit had stiffened, due to ballooning out, to the point where he could not re-enter the airlock. He was forced to bleed off some of his suit&#x27;s pressure, in order to be able to bend the joints, eventually going below safety limits. Leonov did not report his action on the radio to avoid alarming others, but Soviet state radio and television had earlier stopped their live broadcasts from the spacecraft when the mission experienced difficulties. The two crew members subsequently experienced difficulty in sealing the hatch properly due to thermal distortion caused by Leonov&#x27;s lengthy troubles returning to the craft, followed by a troublesome re-entry in which malfunction of the automatic landing system forced the use of its manual backup. The spacecraft was so cramped that the two cosmonauts, both wearing spacesuits, could not return to their seats to restore the ship&#x27;s center of mass for 46 seconds after orienting the ship for reentry and a landing in Perm Krai. The orbital module did not properly disconnect from the landing module, not unlike Vostok 1, causing the spherical return vehicle to spin wildly until the modules disconnected at 100 km.

The delay of 46 seconds caused the spacecraft to land from the intended landing zone, in the inhospitable forests of Upper Kama Upland, somewhere west of Solikamsk. Although flight controllers had no idea where the spacecraft had landed or whether Leonov and Belyayev had survived, the cosmonauts&#x27; families were told that they were resting after having been recovered. The two men were both familiar with the harsh climate and knew that bears and wolves, made aggressive by mating season, lived in the &quot;taiga&quot;; the spacecraft carried a pistol and &quot;plenty of ammunition&quot;, but the incident later drove the development of a dedicated TP-82 Cosmonaut survival pistol. Although aircraft quickly located the cosmonauts, the area was so heavily forested that helicopters could not land. When night arrived, the temperature dropped to , and the spacecraft&#x27;s hatch had been blown open by explosive bolts. Warm clothes and supplies were dropped and the cosmonauts spent a freezing night in the capsule or &quot;Sharik&quot; in Russian. Even worse, the electrical system completely malfunctioned so that the heater would not work, but the fans ran at full blast. A rescue party arrived on skis the next day as it was too risky to try an airlift from the site. The advance party chopped wood and built a small log cabin and an enormous fire. After a more comfortable second night in the forest, the cosmonauts skied to a waiting helicopter several kilometers away and flew first to Perm, then to Baikonur for their mission debriefing.

General Nikolai Kamanin&#x27;s diary later gave the landing location of the Voskhod 2, about from Perm in the Ural mountains in heavy forest at on 19 March 1965 09:02 GMT. Initially, there was some confusion and it was believed that Voskhod 2 landed not far from Shchuchin (about south-west of Bereznikov, north of Perm), but no indication was received from the spacecraft. Apparently a commander of one of the search helicopters reported finding Voskhod 2, &quot;On the forest road between the villages of Sorokovaya and Shchuchino, about 30 kilometers southwest of the town of Berezniki, I see the red parachute and the two cosmonauts. There is deep snow all around...&quot;

The capsule is currently on display at the museum of RKK Energiya in Korolev, near Moscow.

==Spacewalk==

On reaching orbit in Voskhod 2, Leonov and Belyayev attached the EVA backpack to Leonov&#x27;s Berkut (&quot;Golden Eagle&quot;) space suit, a modified Vostok Sokol-1 intravehicular (IV) suit. The white metal EVA backpack provided 45 minutes of oxygen for breathing and cooling. Oxygen vented through a relief valve into space, carrying away heat, moisture, and exhaled carbon dioxide. The space suit pressure could be set at either or .

Belyayev then deployed and pressurised the Volga inflatable airlock. The airlock was necessary for two reasons: first, the capsule&#x27;s avionics used vacuum tubes, which required a constant atmosphere for air cooling. Also, supplies of nitrogen and oxygen sufficient to replenish the atmosphere after EVA could not be carried due to the spacecraft&#x27;s weight limit. By contrast, the American Gemini capsule used solid state avionics, and an atmosphere of oxygen only, at a pressure of , which could easily be replenished after EVA. The Volga airlock was designed, built, and tested in nine months in mid-1964. At launch, Volga fit over the hatch of Voskhod 2, extending beyond the spacecraft&#x27;s hull. The airlock comprised a wide metal ring fitted over the inward-opening hatch of Voskhod 2, a double-walled fabric airlock tube with a deployed length of , and a wide metal upper ring around the wide inward-opening airlock hatch. Volga&#x27;s deployed internal volume was .

The fabric airlock tube was made rigid by about 40 airbooms, clustered as three independent groups. Two groups sufficed for deployment. The airbooms needed seven minutes to fully inflate. Four spherical tanks held sufficient oxygen to inflate the airbooms and pressurise the airlock. Two lights lit the airlock interior, and three 16mm cameras — two in the airlock, one outside on a boom-mounted to the upper ring — recorded the historic first spacewalk.

Belyayev controlled the airlock from inside Voskhod 2, but a set of backup controls for Leonov was suspended on bungee cords inside the airlock. Leonov entered the Volga, then Belyayev sealed Voskhod 2 behind him and depressurised the airlock. Leonov opened Volga&#x27;s outer hatch and pushed out to the end of his umbilicus. He later said the umbilicus gave him tight control of his movements — an observation purportedly belied by subsequent American spacewalk experience. Leonov reported looking down and seeing from the Straits of Gibraltar to the Caspian Sea.

After Leonov returned to his couch, Belyayev fired pyrotechnic bolts to discard the Volga. Sergei Korolev, Chief Designer at OKB-1 Design Bureau (now RKK Energia), stated after the EVA that Leonov could have remained outside for much longer than he did, while Mstislav Keldysh, &quot;chief theoretician&quot; of the Soviet space program and President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the EVA showed that future cosmonauts would find work in space easy.

The government news agency, TASS, reported that, &quot;outside the ship and after returning, Leonov feels well&quot;; however, post-Cold War Russian documents reveal a different story — that Leonov&#x27;s Berkut space suit ballooned, making bending difficult. Because of this, Leonov was unable to reach the shutter switch on his thigh for his chest-mounted camera. He could not take pictures of Voskhod 2, but was able to recover the camera mounted on Volga which recorded his EVA for posterity but only after it stuck and he had to exert considerable effort to push it down in front of him. After 12 minutes walking in space Leonov re-entered Volga.

Later accounts report Cosmonaut Leonov violated procedure by entering the airlock head-first, then became stuck sideways when he turned to close the outer hatch, forcing him to flirt with decompression sickness (the &quot;bends&quot;) by lowering the suit pressure so he could bend to free himself. Leonov said that he had a suicide pill to swallow had he been unable to re-enter the Voskhod 2, and Belyayev been forced to abandon him in orbit.

Doctors reported that Leonov nearly suffered heatstroke — his core body temperature increased by 1.8 °C (3.2 °F) in 20 minutes; Leonov said he was up to his knees in sweat, which sloshed in the suit. In an interview published in the &quot;Soviet Military Review&quot; in 1980, Leonov downplayed his difficulties, saying that &quot;building manned orbital stations and exploring the Universe are inseparably linked with man&#x27;s activity in open space. There is no end of work in this field&quot;.

== Crew recovery ==
The capsule touched down on land in the Perm region of Russia. It missed the intended landing site by approximately . This was due to a failure in the navigation system which caused the automated braking system to fail. To correct this problem as much as possible the crew manually controlled the braking system to deorbit and land the capsule. Once the capsule touched down and the crew was able to set foot back on soil the crew recovery had just begun.

Given that the capsule landed in a rural area with a tracking system that had an accuracy of 50–70 kilometers, the landing site was not immediately known. It was even admitted by General Nikolai Kamanin that officials were unaware of the landing for hours after touch down. Approximately 4 hours after the capsule touched down a helicopter spotted the capsule and crew. The location in which the capsule touched down was too dense for a helicopter to land and recover the crew. Leonov and Belyayev could have likely been recovered by a helicopter with the use of a rope and ladder but it was deemed too dangerous by the marshal of the aviation Rudenko. This resulted in Leonov and Belyayev spending a total of 3 days, two nights, in the forest before finally being recovered. The cosmonauts did come partially equipped for this situation taking a survival kit which included a knife and a pistol. Also, the two cosmonauts had experience that would aid them in this situation: Belyayev grew up in Chelishchevo with the dream of becoming a hunter, while Leonov had spent time in the wilderness alone as an artistic outlet. Throughout the nights the temperature would drop to .

During this time helicopters dropped supplies for the cosmonauts including warm clothes, boots, water containers, and more. Helicopters also dropped doctors and technicians close to the landing site so they could trek to the landing site and support the cosmonauts. Others were also dropped by helicopters to start clearing a landing pad that was closer to the capsule. With more resources and supplies after their first night the landing site was more sustainable. This included a fire, a makeshift log cabin and they were even brought cheese, sausage, and bread for supper. After spending two cold nights in a dense forest, Leonov and Belyayev were able to ski with the help of some rescuers to reach the helicopters landing site. The cosmonauts were then flown to Perm and ultimately to Baikonur where they would have their first debriefing about the mission. The location at which Voskhod 2 touched down is marked by a plaque with a 400-meter-long wooden walkway to the destination. The path took approximately two weeks to complete by volunteers.

==In popular culture==

<text>Non serviam is Latin for &quot;I will not serve&quot;.

Today &quot;non serviam&quot; is also used as a motto by a number of political, cultural, and religious groups to express their wish to rebel. It may be used to express a radical view against established beliefs and organizational structures accepted as the status quo.

==Use==
In the Latin Vulgate, Jeremiah laments that the people of Israel speak &quot;non serviam&quot; to express their rejection of God (). This is the only appearance of the phrase in the Vulgate.

In James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;, Stephen Dedalus says &quot;I will not serve that in which I no longer believe whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use – silence, exile, and cunning.&quot; In a climactic moment of &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Dedalus is confronted in a brothel by an apparition of his dead mother, urging him to repent and avoid &quot;the fire of hell.&quot; He cries out &quot;&quot;Ah non, par exemple!&quot; The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam! (...) No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I&#x27;ll bring you all to heel!&quot; 

In modern times, &quot;non serviam&quot; has developed into a general phrase used to express radical, sometimes even revolutionary rejection of conformity, not necessarily limited to religious matters and as expressed in modern literary adaptations of the motto.

Non Serviam was the third single released from Frank Turner&#x27;s No. 1 Album FTHC.

It is also the name of a French underground extreme music collective.

<doc id="195228" wikidata="Q170170" url="?curid=195228" title="Ramsar Convention">
<text>The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of Ramsar sites (wetlands). It is also known as the Convention on Wetlands. It is named after the city of Ramsar in Iran, where the convention was signed in 1971.

Every three years, representatives of the contracting parties meet as the Conference of the Contracting Parties (COP), the policy-making organ of the convention which adopts decisions (site designations, resolutions and recommendations) to administer the work of the convention and improve the way in which the parties are able to implement its objectives. In 2022, COP15 was held in Montreal, Canada.

==List of wetlands of international importance==


The list of wetlands of international importance included 2,531 Ramsar sites in February 2025 covering over . The countries with most sites are the United Kingdom with 175 and Mexico with 142. The country with the largest surface area of listed wetland is Bolivia, with around .

The Ramsar Sites Information Service (RSIS) is a searchable database which provides information on each Ramsar site.

==International cooperation==


As of 2016 there are 18 transboundary Ramsar sites, and 15 Ramsar regional initiatives covering regions of the Mediterranean, Asia, Africa, and South America.

=== International organization partners ===
The Ramsar Convention works closely with six other organisations known as international organization partners (IOPs). These are:
* BirdLife International
* International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
* International Water Management Institute (IWMI)
* Wetlands International
* WWF International
* Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust (WWT)
These organizations support the work of the convention by providing expert technical advice, helping implement field studies, and providing financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the conference of the parties and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel.

=== Other partners ===
The convention collaborates with a network of partners:
* Biodiversity-related conventions including the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), the World Heritage Convention (WHC), and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES);
* Project funding bodies including global environmental funds, multilateral development banks and bilateral donors;
*UN agencies such as UNEP, UNDP, UNESCO, and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, and specific programmes such as UNESCO&#x27;s Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB);
* Non-governmental organizations including the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, the Society of Wetland Scientists, the International Association for Impact Assessment, and many others;
* Since 1998 the convention has also benefited from a strong partnership with Danone including the Évian brand, and since 2007 from the Biosphere Connections partnership with the Star Alliance airline network.

== Bodies established by the convention ==

=== Conference of the Contracting Parties ===
This is the convention&#x27;s governing body consisting of all governments that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.

=== The Standing Committee ===
The Standing Committee is the intersessional executive body which represents the COP between its triennial meetings, within the framework of the decisions made by the COP. The contracting parties that are members of the Standing Committee are elected by each meeting of the COP to serve for the three years.

=== The Scientific and Technical Review Panel ===
The Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP) provides scientific and technical guidance to the Conference of Contracting Parties, the Standing Committee, and the Ramsar Secretariat.

=== The Secretariat ===
The Secretariat carries out the day-to-day coordination of the convention&#x27;s activities. It is based at the headquarters of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in Gland, Switzerland.

The implementation of the Ramsar Convention is a continuing partnership between the Conference of Contracting Parties, the Standing Committee, and the Secretariat, with the advice of the subsidiary expert body, the Scientific and Technical Review Panel (STRP), and the support of the international organization partners (IOPs).

Musonda Mumba is the seventh secretary general of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.

== World Wetlands Day ==
2 February is World Wetlands Day, marking the convention&#x27;s adoption on 2 February 1971. Established to raise awareness about the value of wetlands for humanity and the planet, WWD was celebrated for the first time in 1997, and has grown since then. In 2015 World Wetlands Day was celebrated in 59 countries.

== History ==
The convention was co-founded by Eskandar Firouz (former environment minister of Iran), Luc Hoffmann of Tour du Valat research station in the Camargue in France, and Geoffrey Matthews of the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge, England in the late 1960s. The conference, which adopted the terms of the agreement, was held in the Iranian Caspian Sea resort of Ramsar on 2 February 1971. The convention turned 50 in 2021.

== Implementation ==
Despite its quasi-universal application, the domestic response to this treaty is often half-hearted and inadequate. By way of example, Germany joined the Convention in 1976 and has, &quot;[as of 2022], failed to give effect to the Ramsar Convention in the manner set out by the constitution of Germany.&quot;

<text>Zoran Đinđić (, ; 1 August 1952 – 12 March 2003) was a Serbian politician and philosopher who served as the prime minister of Serbia from 2001 until his assassination in 2003. He was the mayor of Belgrade in 1997. Đinđić was a long-time opposition politician and held a doctorate in philosophy.

Đinđić was one of the original thirteen restorers of the modern day Democratic Party, becoming its president in 1994. During the 1990s, he was one of the co-leaders of the opposition to the administration of Slobodan Milošević, and became the Prime Minister of Serbia in 2001 after the overthrow of Milošević.

As Prime Minister, he advocated pro-democratic reforms and the integration of Serbia into European structures. His government ratified the European Convention on Human Rights and implemented innovations in line with the Council of Europe recommendations, which led to the introduction of institutions for the protection of human rights and freedoms, as well as for Serbia and Montenegro to become a member state of the Council of Europe in 2003. His government strongly advocated cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Following the arrest of Special Operations Unit (JSO) members and extradition to the ICTY, the JSO organized an armed mutiny in November 2001 in Belgrade. Đinđić was assassinated in 2003 by Zvezdan Jovanović, a former JSO member operative with ties to the Zemun Clan.

==Early life and education==
Đinđić was born in Bosanski Šamac, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia where his father was stationed as an officer of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). His paternal side hailed from Toplica in southern Serbia. His mother Mila Dušanić (c. 1931-2 - 14 March 2016), a housewife, raised him and his elder sister Gordana; the family moved according to his father&#x27;s jobs. Ten years of Zoran&#x27;s childhood were spent in the town of Travnik, in central Bosnia. Eventually, the family moved to the capital, Belgrade, after his mother had gained a post there. Đinđić attended Ninth Belgrade Gymnasium, subsequently enrolling at the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy, graduating in 1974. During his university days he developed an interest in politics. 

After being convicted in 1974 by the communist authorities and through Party-controlled media for his role in his attempt to organize an independent political movement of Yugoslav students, Đinđić emigrated to West Germany thanks to the intervention of former German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who persuaded authorities to let Đinđić come to Germany instead of serving his sentence in Yugoslavia. He continued his studies with professor Jürgen Habermas in Frankfurt. In Germany, Đinđić obtained a PhD in philosophy from the University of Konstanz in 1979. As a student, he was greatly influenced by Habermas&#x27;s advice that an intellectual had a duty not only to think, but to act. One fellow Yugoslav student who knew him in Germany, Milorad Vučelić, recalled that Đinđić was known on campus &quot;not only for his brilliance as a student, but that he was open to life. He wasn&#x27;t a typical boring intellectual. He knew how to live. He had great-looking girlfriends. He was extremely cool.&quot; While a student at the University of Konstanz, he maintained close ties to student anarchist groups and participated in the Praxis-run Korčula Summer School. He became proficient in German. Later, three months before serving as Serbian prime minister, he also mastered English.

==Political career==

In 1979, Đinđić returned to Yugoslavia to take a teaching post at the University of Novi Sad. In the 1980s, he was a writer for the &quot;Literary Review&quot;, an influential Belgrade journal.

In an essay in the June 1988 edition of the &quot;Literary Review&quot;, Đinđić called for preserving the status quo established in 1974 with the Kosovo region to remain an autonomous province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia, declaring that if Kosovo were to lose its autonomy: &quot;we will be able to declare with considerable certainty that in every future Serbian state Kosovo will be a permanent source of repression.&quot; Đinđić&#x27;s stance on the Kosovo question marked him as an opponent of Slobodan Milošević who starting in 1987 had campaigned to end Kosovo&#x27;s autonomy. One intellectual, Drinka Gojković recalled in 1996: &quot;You can&#x27;t imagine how wonderful it was then to read his writing. While everyone was screaming, using shocking language to fan hatred, Zoran was writing these beautiful essays, arguing that nationalism was not the way&quot;. On 28 June 1989, Milošević ended the autonomy of Kosovo, which caused much alarm in the other Yugoslav republics where it was feared that Milošević might do something similar.

On 11 December 1989 together with other Serb intellectuals and pro-democracy activists he founded the liberal Democratic Party (DS) based on the similarly conceptualized Democratic Party that existed in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He became the party&#x27;s Executive Board Chairman in 1990, and got elected to the Parliament of Serbia the same year. In the early 1990s, Đinđić shifted over to a more nationalist position that was broadly supportive of Milošević&#x27;s policies, much to the chagrin of his former admirers. In 1993, he played a leading role in writing the platform of the DS, calling for a referendum on the restoration of the monarchy. Đinđić made it clear that he personally favored restoring the House of Karađorđević. The same platform called for the Kosovo region to remain part of Serbia proper and for the government to take anti-natalist policies designed to limit the birthrate of the Kosovo Albanians. In January 1994 he replaced Dragoljub Mićunović as President of the Democratic Party.

The new balance of power within DS led to an early party conference. At the party conference on 5 January 1994 in Belgrade, Đinđić became president, pushing out personal political mentor Mićunović who was forced into resigning as the local party branches turned against him. The (in)famous quip uttered at the conference by 41-year-old Đinđić about 63-year-old Mićunović was: &quot;Mićunović&#x27;s time has passed... He&#x27;s no Tina Turner who sings better now than when she was thirty&quot;. In his embittered speech at the conference during which he resigned his post, Mićunović characterized the manner of Đinđić&#x27;s takeover of DS as the &quot;combination of Machiavellianism and revolutionary technique&quot;. In this internal party showdown with Mićunović, Đinđić also benefited from some discreet support in the Milošević-controlled state-run media. Though many DS members didn&#x27;t like the way this transfer of power was executed, symbolically referring to it as &quot;oceubistvo&quot; (patricide), Đinđić managed to quickly move DS away from what he occasionally referred to in derisive terms as the &quot;debate club&quot; towards a modern and efficient organizational structure that functioned according to a business management model. In February 1994, Đinđić visited Pale to meet with Radovan Karadžić, saying that he had gone to Bosnia to &quot;express solidarity with the people of the Bosnian Serb republic.&quot;

The following year, on 15 April 1995, regular party conference was held and Đinđić got re-elected as party president. Though a much better organized party under Đinđić, DS still experienced trouble formulating a clear stance on the national question. Đinđić&#x27;s own actions perhaps made a good illustration of this seemingly confused standing on both sides of the issue. Đinđić basically refused to acknowledge the national question as a real issue, making not a single mention of the Serbs living in other parts of the former Yugoslavia in his book &quot;Yugoslavia as an Unfinished State&quot;. At the same time he maintained close links with Bosnian Serb politician and the President of Republika Srpska Radovan Karadžić, visiting him at Pale in February 1994 while American forces threatened to bombard Bosnian Serb positions. This seeming flip-flopping on the national issue was effectively used by DS&#x27; political opponents and Đinđić&#x27;s critics across the political spectrum.

As the Bosnian War ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995, in addition to his grip on power domestically, Milošević enjoyed stable support from the international community that recognized him as the &quot;peace and stability factor in the Balkans&quot;. The next chance to dent his armour came at the November 1996 municipal elections, which the DS entered as part of an opposition coalition called Zajedno featuring SPO, DSS, and GSS. Democratic Party (at the time with a total of only 7,000 members across Serbia) joined Zajedno against Đinđić&#x27;s personal wishes as he got outvoted on three separate occasions when the decision was discussed internally. Following opposition victories in key Serbian cities such as Belgrade, Niš and Novi Sad, Milošević refused to recognize the results, sparking three months of protest marches by hundreds of thousands of citizens. After a massive series of public protests over election fraud perpetrated by the central government under Slobodan Milošević during the winter 1996–1997, Đinđić became Mayor of Belgrade, the first post-communist mayor to hold that post after the Second World War. Under pressure, Milošević acknowledged the results and on 21 February 1997 Đinđić got inaugurated as the mayor.

Later that year Đinđić made a bold decision to boycott the parliamentary elections on 21 December 1997, thus breaking up the Zajedno coalition.
United only by their political enemy, the coalition &quot;Zajedno&quot; (Together) with Vuk Drašković&#x27;s SPO and Vesna Pešić&#x27;s GSS collapsed only four months after their victory. Đinđić was voted out of his position as Belgrade mayor by the SPO, SPS and SRS.

Đinđić and his party boycotted the 1997 Serbian presidential and parliamentary elections, as did others in the &quot;democratic bloc&quot; including Vojislav Koštunica&#x27;s Democratic Party of Serbia. This caused the Socialists and Radicals to sweep most of the seats, leaving the third largest portion to Vuk Drašković&#x27;s SPO. The boycott helped forced a second set of elections when the second round was ruled to have had insufficient turnout. Serbian law at the time mandated at least 50% turnout for a president to be elected.

In this case, Vojislav Šešelj won the second round against the Socialists&#x27; Zoran Lilić; when the election was re-done, Šešelj lost to the Socialists&#x27; Milan Milutinović. This caused Šešelj to allege electoral fraud and lead protests against the government. He changed his mind however, when the Kosovo crisis began in early 1998, and his Radicals joined the government as a coalition partner. When Vuk Drašković joined the Yugoslav government in early 1999, this left Đinđić as Serbia&#x27;s main opposition leader as NATO&#x27;s war began against Yugoslavia.

After former secret policeman, anti-Milošević publisher and journalist Slavko Ćuruvija was murdered on Orthodox Easter during NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Đinđić sought safety and fled to temporary exile in Montenegro, allegedly because he was next on the assassination list of then-President Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s secret service.

In September 1999, Đinđić was named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the most important politicians at the beginning of the 21st century. Upon his return to the country in July 1999, Đinđić was charged with draft dodging; charges were subsequently dropped by military prosecutors the following month.

A series of mysterious assassinations, including the shooting of Yugoslav Defence Minister Pavle Bulatović on 7 February 2000 in a restaurant, began taking place. Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Šešelj maintained during his testimony at Milošević&#x27;s trial that this murder was carried as a prelude to the successful hijacking of the Socialist People&#x27;s Party of Montenegro in October 2000 by Predrag Bulatović, who successfully reversed the parliamentary majority won by Milošević and his allies, moving his party in alliance with Đinđić&#x27;s Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS). In April, JAT chairman and Yugoslav United Left member Žika Petrović was gunned down as he was walking his dog. In late August, former Serbian President Ivan Stambolić disappeared; he had been murdered on Fruška Gora mountain by members of Serbia&#x27;s Special Operations Unit. Đinđić and his allies openly accused Milošević of these events, claiming that he had either ordered them or was no longer able to maintain control and should therefore step down.

Đinđić played a prominent role in the September 2000 presidential elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and in the 5th October uprising that overthrew Milošević after further street protests. While Koštunica headlined the effort in October, Đinđić led the broad-based 19-party Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition to its victory in Serbian elections of December 2000. The Democratic Party was the largest party of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia block that won 64.7% of the votes in the December 2000 elections, getting 176 of 250 seats in the Parliamentary Assembly. In 2001 Đinđić was appointed Prime Minister of Serbia at the head of the first post-Milošević government on 25 January 2001.

On 1 April 2001, former president Slobodan Milošević was arrested by Yugoslav authorities. Although no official charges were made, Milošević was suspected of abuse of power and corruption. Following Milošević&#x27;s arrest, the United States pressured the Yugoslav government to extradite Milošević to the ICTY or lose financial aid from the IMF and World Bank. President Koštunica opposed extradition of Milošević, arguing that it would violate the Yugoslav Constitution. Prime Minister Đinđić called an extraordinary meeting of the government to issue a decree for extradition. Milošević&#x27;s lawyers appealed the extradition process to the Yugoslav Constitutional Court. The court requested two weeks to deliberate the appeal. Ignoring objections from the president and the constitutional court, Đinđić ordered the extradition of Milošević to the ICTY. On 28 June, Milošević was flown by helicopter from Belgrade to the U.S. air base in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina from where he was then flown to The Hague, Netherlands.

Đinđić played a key role in sending Milošević to the ICTY in The Hague. The extradition caused political turmoil in Yugoslavia. President Koštunica denounced the extradition as illegal and unconstitutional, while a junior party in the Đinđić coalition government left in protest. Đinđić stated there would be negative consequences if the government did not cooperate. Additionally, the government argued that sending Milošević to the ICTY was not extradition as it is a UN institution and not a foreign country. Following the extradition, Yugoslavia received approximately $1 billion dollars in financial aid.
Later, Đinđić said that he became disillusioned with the protracted trial of Milošević, qualifying it as a &quot;circus&quot;. Đinđić said the court in The Hague was &quot;allowing Milošević to behave like a demagogue and to control the trial&quot;.

In August 2001, after meeting with Koštunica&#x27;s cabinet, former Serbian State Security officer Momir Gavrilović was murdered. Koštunica claimed that Gavrilović was briefing his cabinet about connections of some members of Serbian government with organized crime. This caused Koštunica and his 45 DSS members of parliament to withdraw from DOS and the government. Đinđić attempted to expel the DSS members from parliament, referring to the existence of imperative mandate that places all deputies under the control of the party elected to parliament. Meanwhile, Koštunica and his party openly accused Đinđić of involvement with organised crime.

Đinđić was received favorably by Western nations. His meetings with Western leaders George W. Bush, Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and others strongly indicated that the West supported his politics. Đinđić had constant disagreements with his ex-coalition partner and then-Yugoslav federal president Vojislav Koštunica, who was his biggest political rival in Serbia itself. His earlier close relationship with the Montenegrin president Milo Đukanović had also cooled due to Đukanović&#x27;s separatist aspirations for an independent Montenegro state.

Đinđić had also increased economic reforms while prime minister of Serbia. Such reforms include price liberalization and a reduction of the money supply with the goal of achieving macroeconomic stability. Small-scale privatization also occurred with regards to banking assets and the financial sector. Lastly, the government of Serbia eliminated many trade barriers with the goal of eventually integrating into the European Union. The early economic reforms under the Koštunica-Đinđić government had been maintained after his assassination allowing the economy to increase substantially prior to the global economic crisis of 2008. However, unemployment still remained very high, and the pace and quantity of reforms did not return Serbia to the same living standards it had prior to 1990.

From January 2003, Đinđić launched a wide diplomatic campaign for the determination of the Kosovo issue.

Shortly before his assassination, Đinđić made a statement in which he was talking about an idea of creating a Union of Serb States consisting of Serbia, Montenegro and Republika Srpska, which would be a federal nation state.

==Assassination==

As reported by Reuters on 18 March 2003, according to Carla Del Ponte, Đinđić had predicted his own assassination on 17 February just weeks before it happened. Despite Koštunica&#x27;s accusations of Đinđić being close to organised crime, the latter always insisted that he was determined to clean Serbia, and created the &quot;Special Tribunal&quot; with a witness protection program. This alarmed organized crime leaders who were intertwined with elements of the Serbian secret police which remained loyal to the ousted Milošević.

Under orders from Milorad &quot;Legija&quot; Ulemek, the former commander of the Special Operations Unit of Yugoslavia&#x27;s secret police, Đinđić was assassinated by Ulemek&#x27;s soldier Zvezdan Jovanović in Belgrade on 12 March 2003. Jovanović shot him from the building across from the main Serbian government building at 12:23 PM, hitting him once in the chest. The high-power bullet of a Heckler &amp; Koch G3 battle rifle penetrated his heart and killed him almost instantly.

He was rushed to a hospital where he was treated, but pronounced dead one hour later. Ulemek was blamed as the mastermind of the crime. He was one of the leading persons in the Zemun clan, a leading organized crime group in Serbia. He was later prosecuted and convicted of being involved in some of the mysterious assassinations and assassination attempts that marked Yugoslavia in the months before Đinđić took power. Nataša Mićić, then acting President of Serbia, declared a state of emergency immediately. Zoran Živković was elected by the Serbian Democratic Party as Đinđić&#x27;s successor.

On 23 May 2007, twelve men were convicted for the assassination of Zoran Đinđić. Among the convicted defendants was Ulemek, who, during the four years preceding the murder of Đinđić, had traveled to Switzerland, Austria, the Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Singapore and Croatia using a fraudulent passport that had been one of a batch of blank passports stolen from the Croatian Consulate in Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1999. Ulemek, along with Zvezdan Jovanović, was charged with being the ringleader of the assassination plot carried out on 12 March 2003, when Đinđić was fatally shot. Three of the twelve men convicted are still on the run and remain the subject of INTERPOL Red notices. Specialist officers in INTERPOL&#x27;s Fugitive Investigative Support Unit continue to liaise with and assist member countries in the investigation of various leads for the following individuals wanted by Serbian authorities: Milan Jurišić, Ninoslav Konstantinović and Vladimir Milisavljević.

==Literary work==
He published four books and more than a hundred articles and essays on various topics.

Books published in Serbian:
*&quot;Subjektivnost i nasilje, Nastаnak sistemа u filozofiji nemаčkog ideаlizmа&quot;, (Subjectivity and Violence: The Origin of Systems in German Idealist Philosophy) Istrаživаčko-izdаvаčki centаr SSO Srbije, Izаzovi, 1982, drugo izdаnje Novi Sаd, Dnevnik, 2003

==Personal life==
Đinđić and his wife Ružica had a daughter and a son, Jovana and Luka, both minors at the time of his assassination.

==Legacy==
His state procession and funeral, held on 15 March 2003, was attended by hundreds of thousands of citizens and by foreign delegations. Đinđić&#x27;s death represented a political and moral tragedy to many Serbs who saw in him a statesman of hope who offered peaceful coexistence with neighboring nations, integration to Europe and the rest of the world, economic prosperity and a brighter future. He appealed to people in Serbia whose goal was for their country to join the West and their lives become more normalized.

Đinđić and Vojislav Koštunica both needed each other for their respective goals. Koštunica believed that Serbia needed to join the West so that it could keep Kosovo and so that Republika Srpska could be maintained. Koštunica, who served as Đinđić&#x27;s political opponent and critic during his premiership, acknowledged his work two years later with these words:

Zoran Đinđić was the first to take this difficult task to lead government in very unstable times. Probably his energy and commitment made it possible for things to move forward. It is one thing to watch it from the sidelines and it is completely different to be a part of it. I understand that now when I am Prime Minister and watch things a bit differently. He was very important for the whole process.
Following his death, a small but influential movement emerged throughout Serbia and the Serbian diaspora organized around a short documentary about Zoran Đinđić (created by Belgrade director Aleksandar Mandić). The documentary – &quot;Ako Srbija Stane&quot; (&quot;If Serbia stops&quot;) – was a collection of edited speeches given by Đinđić on a speaking tour in Serbia shortly before his death. A movement called &quot;Kapiraj&quot; created a network of students and other young people who were committed to copying and distributing the documentary free of charge. This campaign was known by the slogan &quot;Kapiraj-kopiraj&quot; (which means &quot;Catch on and Copy&quot; in Serbian). Đinđić is often described as a Machiavellian figure due to his political manoeuvrings, though observers also note his pragmatic and modest approach, traits which contrasted with some of the other Serbian politicians of his time.

<text>Albert (, ; – 1 April 1412) was King of Sweden from 1364 to 1389 and Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1384 to 1412.

==Background==
He was the second son of Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg and Euphemia Eriksdotter, the daughter of Duke Erik Magnusson and sister of King Magnus Eriksson of Sweden and Norway. 

In 1384, he inherited the ducal title of Mecklenburg and united it with Sweden in a personal union. Albert based his claim to the Swedish crown on his family ties: his mother, whose paternal grandfather was King Magnus Ladulås, positioned him as the first in line for the Swedish throne after the dethronement or deaths of all of Magnus Eriksson&#x27;s children. Additionally, Albert traced his lineage through Princess Christina, a daughter of Sverker II, who was King of Sweden from 1196 to 1208.

==Reign==
In 1363, members of the Swedish Council of Aristocracy, led by Bo Jonsson Grip, arrived at the court of Mecklenburg. They had been banished from Sweden after a revolt against King Magnus Eriksson, Albert&#x27;s uncle who was unpopular with the nobility. At the nobles&#x27; request, Albert launched an invasion of Sweden supported by several German dukes and counts and several Hanseatic cities in Northern Germany. Stockholm and Kalmar in Sweden, with large Hanseatic populations, also welcomed the intervention.

Albert was proclaimed King of Sweden and on 18 February 1364. The ceremony took place at the Stones of Mora. A fragment still remains of the stone commemorating the occasion called the Three Crowns stone. This is one of the earliest known example of the use of the three crowns as a national symbol for Sweden.

The arrival of Albert led to eight years of civil war in Sweden between Albert&#x27;s and Magnus&#x27;s supporters. In a battle near Enköping in 1365 between Albert&#x27;s German forces and those of King Magnus, supported by king Haakon VI of Norway, Magnus&#x27;s surviving son, Magnus was defeated and taken prisoner by Albert. After the initial defeat, King Valdemar IV of Denmark, Haakon&#x27;s father-in-law, intervened on Magnus&#x27;s and Haakon&#x27;s behalf, and Valdemar&#x27;s forces were joined by Swedish peasants who supported Magnus. Apart from German strongholds like Stockholm, Albert was unpopular among Swedes who were discontent with Albert&#x27;s policy of appointing Germans as officials in all the Swedish provinces.

With the help of Danish and Swedish allies, King Haakon managed to temporarily beat back Albert and lay siege on Stockholm in 1371. However, the siege was short-lived; with military help from the Swedish nobility in Stockholm, Albert was able to beat back the Norwegians and the Danes. A peace agreement was signed, with the condition that Magnus be released and allowed to travel freely back to Norway (where he had also been king until 1355 and now spent the rest of his life). Albert had secured the Swedish crown, but was also forced to make a belated coronation oath in which he agreed to extensive concessions to the Swedish nobility in the regency council. Bo Jonsson (Grip) used this power to personally usurp 1,500 farms and he soon became Sweden&#x27;s largest landowner, controlling a third of the entirety of the Swedish territory and possessing the largest non-royal wealth in the country.

==Deposition==

Albert kept the crown of Sweden for another 19 years, but most of western Sweden did not support his reign. When he attempted to introduce reduction of the large estates of the Swedish nobility, he lost his support in Stockholm. In 1389, facing a loss of landholdings and wealth, the Swedish regency council turned to Haakon&#x27;s widow Margaret to plead for help in getting rid of Albert. Queen Margaret sent troops and in February 1389, they defeated Albert at the Battle of Åsle. Albert was captured, deposed and sent to Lindholmen Castle in Scania, where he spent the next six years imprisoned. He was released after 16 days of peace negotiations in 1395, during which he agreed to either give up Stockholm within three years, or pay large sums in retribution to Margaret. When the three years were up, Albert&#x27;s (then) only son Erik had died after ruling Gotland in Sweden for a short time as instigated by his father, and Albert chose to give up Stockholm rather than pay the fine. In 1398 the agreement came into force, granting Margaret possession of Stockholm.

Albert returned to Mecklenburg, remarried (to Agnes of Brunswick-Lüneburg), had another son and reigned as Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin until his death, seven months before Margaret&#x27;s in 1412. He had finally formally abdicated his Swedish throne in 1405, but until then he and his wife styled themselves King and Queen of Sweden. His tomb is in the Doberan Minster in Bad Doberan, Germany.

==Marriages and children==
Albert married Richardis of Schwerin, daughter of count Otto of Schwerin, in a marriage contracted in Wismar on 12 October 1352. The King and Queen had two children:

#Erik (died 1397), Swedish crown prince and ruler of Gotland
#Richardis Catherine (died 1400), married in Prague in 1388 to Emperor Charles IV&#x27;s fifth son John of Bohemia (1370–1396), Margrave of Moravia and Duke of Görlitz (Lusatia).

Queen Richardis died in 1377 and was buried in Stockholm.

In February 1396 a double wedding was arranged in Schwerin. Albert married Agnes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, widow of Count Burkhard of Mansfeld (died 1389/1390) and Duke Bogislaw VI of Pomerania (died 1393), while his son Erik married Sophie, the daughter of Duke Bogislaw. Albert and Agnes had a son:

#Albert V of Mecklenburg (died 1423), Duke of Mecklenburg and Schwerin

Queen Agnes died in 1430/1434.

<text>&lt;section begin=&quot;Lede&quot; /&gt;Riemannian geometry is the branch of differential geometry that studies Riemannian manifolds, defined as smooth manifolds with a &quot;Riemannian metric&quot; (an inner product on the tangent space at each point that varies smoothly from point to point). This gives, in particular, local notions of angle, length of curves, surface area and volume. From those, some other global quantities can be derived by integrating local contributions.

Riemannian geometry originated with the vision of Bernhard Riemann expressed in his inaugural lecture &quot;&quot; (&quot;On the Hypotheses on which Geometry is Based&quot;). It is a very broad and abstract generalization of the differential geometry of surfaces in [[Riemannian geometry|R]]3. Development of Riemannian geometry resulted in synthesis of diverse results concerning the geometry of surfaces and the behavior of geodesics on them, with techniques that can be applied to the study of differentiable manifolds of higher dimensions. It enabled the formulation of Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity, made profound impact on group theory and representation theory, as well as analysis, and spurred the development of algebraic and differential topology.&lt;section end=&quot;Lede&quot; /&gt;

== Introduction ==

Riemannian geometry was first put forward in generality by Bernhard Riemann in the 19th century. It deals with a broad range of geometries whose metric properties vary from point to point, including the standard types of non-Euclidean geometry.

Every smooth manifold admits a Riemannian metric, which often helps to solve problems of differential topology. It also serves as an entry level for the more complicated structure of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, which (in four dimensions) are the main objects of the theory of general relativity. Other generalizations of Riemannian geometry include Finsler geometry.

There exists a close analogy of differential geometry with the mathematical structure of defects in regular crystals. Dislocations and disclinations produce torsions and curvature.

The following articles provide some useful introductory material:
* Metric tensor
* Riemannian manifold
* Levi-Civita connection
* Curvature
* Riemann curvature tensor
* List of differential geometry topics
* Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry

==Classical theorems==
What follows is an incomplete list of the most classical theorems in Riemannian geometry. The choice is made depending on its importance and elegance of formulation. Most of the results can be found in the classic monograph by Jeff Cheeger and D. Ebin (see below).

The formulations given are far from being very exact or the most general. This list is oriented to those who already know the basic definitions and want to know what these definitions are about.

===General theorems===
#Gauss–Bonnet theorem The integral of the Gauss curvature on a compact 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold is equal to 2&quot;χ&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) where &quot;χ&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) denotes the Euler characteristic of &quot;M&quot;. This theorem has a generalization to any compact even-dimensional Riemannian manifold, see generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
#Nash embedding theorems. They state that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot;.

===Geometry in large===
In all of the following theorems we assume some local behavior of the space (usually formulated using curvature assumption) to derive some information about the global structure of the space, including either some information on the topological type of the manifold or on the behavior of points at &quot;sufficiently large&quot; distances.

====Pinched sectional curvature====
#Sphere theorem. If &quot;M&quot; is a simply connected compact &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature strictly pinched between 1/4 and 1 then &quot;M&quot; is diffeomorphic to a sphere.
#Cheeger&#x27;s finiteness theorem. Given constants &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, there are only finitely many (up to diffeomorphism) compact &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with sectional curvature |&quot;K&quot;| ≤ &quot;C&quot;, diameter ≤ &quot;D&quot; and volume ≥ &quot;V&quot;.
#Gromov&#x27;s almost flat manifolds. There is an ε&quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 such that if an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold has a metric with sectional curvature |&quot;K&quot;| ≤ ε&quot;n&quot; and diameter ≤ 1 then its finite cover is diffeomorphic to a nil manifold.

==== Sectional curvature bounded below ====
#Cheeger–Gromoll&#x27;s soul theorem. If &quot;M&quot; is a non-compact complete non-negatively curved &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold, then &quot;M&quot; contains a compact, totally geodesic submanifold &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;M&quot; is diffeomorphic to the normal bundle of &quot;S&quot; (&quot;S&quot; is called the soul of &quot;M&quot;.) In particular, if &quot;M&quot; has strictly positive curvature everywhere, then it is diffeomorphic to R&quot;n&quot;. G. Perelman in 1994 gave an astonishingly elegant/short proof of the Soul Conjecture: &quot;M&quot; is diffeomorphic to R&quot;n&quot; if it has positive curvature at only one point.
#Gromov&#x27;s Betti number theorem. There is a constant &quot;C&quot; = &quot;C&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) such that if &quot;M&quot; is a compact connected &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature then the sum of its Betti numbers is at most &quot;C&quot;.
#Grove–Petersen&#x27;s finiteness theorem. Given constants &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, there are only finitely many homotopy types of compact &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with sectional curvature &quot;K&quot; ≥ &quot;C&quot;, diameter ≤ &quot;D&quot; and volume ≥ &quot;V&quot;.

==== Sectional curvature bounded above ====
#The Cartan–Hadamard theorem states that a complete simply connected Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot; with nonpositive sectional curvature is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot; with &quot;n&quot; = dim &quot;M&quot; via the exponential map at any point. It implies that any two points of a simply connected complete Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature are joined by a unique geodesic.
#The geodesic flow of any compact Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature is ergodic.
#If &quot;M&quot; is a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded above by a strictly negative constant &quot;k&quot; then it is a CAT(&quot;k&quot;) space. Consequently, its fundamental group Γ = 1(&quot;M&quot;) is Gromov hyperbolic. This has many implications for the structure of the fundamental group:
::* it is finitely presented;
::* the word problem for Γ has a positive solution;
::* the group Γ has finite virtual cohomological dimension;
::* it contains only finitely many conjugacy classes of elements of finite order;
::* the abelian subgroups of Γ are virtually cyclic, so that it does not contain a subgroup isomorphic to Z×Z.

==== Ricci curvature bounded below====
#Myers theorem. If a complete Riemannian manifold has positive Ricci curvature then its fundamental group is finite.
#Bochner&#x27;s formula. If a compact Riemannian &quot;n&quot;-manifold has non-negative Ricci curvature, then its first Betti number is at most &quot;n&quot;, with equality if and only if the Riemannian manifold is a flat torus.
#Splitting theorem. If a complete &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold has nonnegative Ricci curvature and a straight line (i.e. a geodesic that minimizes distance on each interval) then it is isometric to a direct product of the real line and a complete (&quot;n&quot;-1)-dimensional Riemannian manifold that has nonnegative Ricci curvature.
#Bishop–Gromov inequality. The volume of a metric ball of radius &quot;r&quot; in a complete &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature has volume at most that of the volume of a ball of the same radius &quot;r&quot; in Euclidean space.
#Gromov&#x27;s compactness theorem. The set of all Riemannian manifolds with positive Ricci curvature and diameter at most &quot;D&quot; is pre-compact in the Gromov-Hausdorff metric.

==== Negative Ricci curvature ====
#The isometry group of a compact Riemannian manifold with negative Ricci curvature is discrete.
#Any smooth manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3 admits a Riemannian metric with negative Ricci curvature. (&quot;This is not true for surfaces&quot;.)

==== Positive scalar curvature ====
#The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional torus does not admit a metric with positive scalar curvature.
#If the injectivity radius of a compact &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian manifold is ≥ π then the average scalar curvature is at most &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;-1).

<doc id="195246" wikidata="Q51668" url="?curid=195246" title="The Passion of the Christ">
<text>The Passion of the Christ is a 2004 American epic biblical drama film co-written, co-produced, and directed by Mel Gibson. It stars Jim Caviezel as Jesus of Nazareth, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, mother of Jesus, and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene. It depicts the Passion of Jesus largely according to the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. It also draws on pious accounts such as the Friday of Sorrows, along with other devotional writings, such as the reputed visions attributed to Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich.

The film primarily covers the final twelve hours before Jesus Christ&#x27;s death, known as &quot;the Passion&quot;. It begins with the Agony in the Garden of Olives (i.e., Gethsemane), continues with the betrayal of Judas Iscariot, the brutal Scourging at the Pillar, the suffering of Mary as prophesied by Simeon, the crucifixion and death of Jesus, and ends with a brief depiction of his resurrection. The narrative is interspersed with moments in Jesus&#x27;s life, such as The Last Supper and The Sermon on the Mount, and moments of Jesus&#x27; early life. The film was mostly shot in Italy. The dialogue is entirely in reconstructed Aramaic, Hebrew, and Latin. Although Gibson was initially against it, the film is subtitled.

The film was controversial and received polarized reviews from critics; some regarded the film a religious and holy experience, praising the performances of the cast, production values, and John Debney&#x27;s musical score, while some found it to be antisemitic and the graphic violence to be extreme and emotionally draining. The film grossed $612.1 million worldwide, and became the fifth highest-grossing film of 2004 internationally at the end of its theatrical run. It is the highest-grossing (inflation unadjusted) Christian film of all time, as well as the highest-grossing independent film of all time. It was the highest-grossing R-rated film in the US, at $370.8 million, a record which remained unbroken for 20 years. It received three nominations at the 77th Academy Awards in 2005, for Best Makeup, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score. A sequel is in development.

==Plot==
On the night of Passover in Gethsemane, Jesus prays beside his disciples Peter, James and John. Satan tries to tempt Jesus as his sweat turns into blood and a serpent emerges from Satan&#x27;s guise; Jesus rebukes him by crushing the serpent&#x27;s head. Meanwhile, Judas Iscariot, another of Jesus&#x27; disciples, is bribed by Caiaphas and the Pharisees with thirty pieces of silver, and leads a group of temple guards to the forest where he betrays Jesus&#x27; identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, the commander of the guards. Jesus heals Malchus&#x27; injury and reprimands Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus and beat him on the way to the Sanhedrin while a distraught Malchus remains behind.

Awoken from her sleep, Jesus&#x27; mother Mary senses something is wrong and speaks with Mary Magdalene. John informs them of the arrest, and they reunite with Peter who has followed Jesus and his captors. Caiaphas holds trial during which false accusations are made against Jesus. Some priests, who object to the trial and secretly support Jesus, are expelled from the court. When Jesus claims he is the divine Son of man, Caiaphas angrily tears his robes and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. As Jesus is brutally beaten, Peter is confronted by the mob and he denies being a follower of Jesus. Remembering Jesus&#x27; precise prediction, he weeps bitterly and flees. Meanwhile, a guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Judas then spits on the bag of silver and throws it at their feet and leaves. Haunted by demons throughout the night, he hangs himself outside Jerusalem.

Caiaphas and the crowd bring Jesus before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, to be condemned to death. At the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows Jesus is holy, and after questioning Jesus, Pilate finds no fault in him and transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas since Jesus is from Antipas&#x27; domain of Galilee. Antipas deems him to be a harmless fool and returns him. Pilate then offers the crowd the choice of freeing Jesus or a convicted murderer named Barabbas. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus simply be flogged. The Roman guards brutally scourge him with staves and whips until the Captain of the Guard, Abenader, stops them, blasting the torturers for taking the punishment too far. 

After Jesus is dragged off, Mother Mary and Mary Magdalene clean up Jesus and Magdalene reminisces on Jesus saving her from a stoning during her darkest time. The Roman guards take Jesus to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and hurl insults at him. He is presented before Pilate and the crowd, but Caiaphas, supported by the crowd, continues demanding that he be crucified. Unwilling to instigate an uprising, Pilate washes his hands and orders his crucifixion, claiming no responsibility.
Jesus then carries a heavy wooden cross on the road to Golgotha with two thieves, Dismas and Gesmas, following behind, while Satan observes his suffering sadistically. Along the way, he is constantly harassed by the guards and rampant mob, is comforted by his mother momentarily before being dragged away the guards, is helped with carrying the cross by the unwilling Simon of Cyrene, and is replenished by a woman who wipes his bloodied face with her veil before also being dragged away like Mary. At Golgotha, with Mary, Magdalene, John, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. One of the thieves, Gesmas, mocks Jesus suggesting he get off that cross to prove that he is the Son of God. He prays to God to forgive his tormentors, provides salvation to Dismas who is crucified beside him for his strong faith and repentance, and comforts his mother. Succumbing to his wounds, Jesus surrenders his spirit and dies. A single droplet of rain then falls, triggering an earthquake which damages the Second Temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two. Both the thieves&#x27; legs are broken by the Romans to speed up their passing, and upon seeing Jesus dead, the Roman guard Cassius is ordered to thrust a spear into Jesus to be sure. Cassius does just that and is hit with the blood. The Roman soldiers who mocked and beat Jesus flee in terror while Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus&#x27; body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Three days later, he rises from the dead and exits the tomb.

==Themes==
In &quot;The Passion: Photography from the Movie &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;&quot;, director Mel Gibson says, &quot;This is a movie about love, hope, faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It&#x27;s time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more love, faith, hope and forgiveness.&quot;

==Source material==

===Biblical canon===
According to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; is the four canonical Gospel narratives of Christ&#x27;s passion. The film includes a trial of Jesus at Herod&#x27;s court, which is only found in the Gospel of Luke. The film also draws from other parts of the New Testament. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, &quot;I make all things new&quot;, is found in the Book of Revelation, Chapter 21, verse 5.

The film also refers to the Old Testament. The film begins with an epigraph from the Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant from Isaiah. In the opening scene set in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus crushes a serpent&#x27;s head in direct visual allusion to Genesis 3:15. Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the Psalms, beyond the instances recorded in the New Testament.

===Traditional iconography and stories===
Many of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the Passion in art. For example, the 14 Stations of the Cross are central to the depiction of the Via Dolorosa in &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin.

At the suggestion of actress Maia Morgenstern, the Passover Seder is quoted early in the film. Mary asks &quot;Why is this night different from other nights?&quot;, and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: &quot;Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.&quot;

The conflation of Mary Magdalene with the adulteress saved from stoning by Jesus has some precedent in Catholic tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, Dismas and Gesmas (also Gestas).

The film also took some inspiration from visions from Catholic visionaries such as Mary of Jesus of Ágreda and Anne Catherine Emmerich. &quot;The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, a book by Clemens Brentano that details the visions of Anne Catherine Emmerich, was particularly inspiring to Gibson because it provided vivid descriptions of the crucifixion, as well as additional roles played by Mary, Jesus&#x27; mother.

The depiction of Veronica wiping the face of Jesus is from a Catholic tradition and relates to a relic known as the Veil of Veronica. The film slightly showed the veil bearing the image of the face of Jesus. Its origin lies in the sixth Station of the Cross, in which Saint Veronica wipes Jesus&#x27;s face with her veil after he encounters her along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary.

==Production==
===Script and language===
Mel Gibson originally announced that he would use two old languages without subtitles and rely on &quot;filmic storytelling&quot;. Because the story of the Passion is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: &quot;I think it&#x27;s almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear &#x27;To be or not to be&#x27; and you instinctively say to yourself, &#x27;That is the question.&#x27;&quot; The script was written in English by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald, then translated by William Fulco, S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic. Fulco sometimes incorporated deliberate errors in pronunciations and word endings when the characters were speaking a language unfamiliar to them, and some of the crude language used by the Roman soldiers was not translated in the subtitles.

In February 2008, it was reported that screenwriter Benedict Fitzgerald was suing Gibson, along with Vicki Christianson, Icon Productions, Icon Distribution, Marquis Films, and Airborne Productions, for defrauding him of millions of dollars, as well as incorrectly taking co-writing credit for the screenplay of the film. In May 2009, Gibson agreed to an undisclosed settlement with Fitzgerald. Details of the settlement, agreed at Los Angeles County Superior Court, were not released. Gibson&#x27;s representatives did not comment on the settlement.

===Filming===

The film was produced independently and shot in Italy at Cinecittà Studios in Rome, and on location in the city of Matera and the ghost town of Craco, both in the Basilicata region. The estimated US$30 million production cost, plus an additional estimated $15 million in marketing costs, were fully borne by Gibson and his company Icon Productions. According to the DVD special feature, Martin Scorsese had recently finished his film &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, from which Gibson and his production designers constructed part of their set. This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.

Gibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including Fr. Jonathan Morris, and a local priest, Philip J. Ryan, who visited the set daily to provide counsel, Confession, and Holy Communion to Jim Caviezel. Masses were celebrated for cast and crew in several locations. There were other priests involved with the filming, including Abbé Michel Debourges from the Institute of Christ the King, Stephen Somerville, and Jean-Marie Charles-Roux, all of whom were asked by Mel Gibson to daily celebrate the Traditional Latin Mass. During filming, key set production assistant Jan Michelini was struck twice by lightning and hence nicknamed &quot;Lighting Boy&quot; as seen in the credits. Minutes later, Caviezel also was struck.

===Music===

Three albums were released with Mel Gibson&#x27;s co-operation: (1) the soundtrack of John Debney&#x27;s original orchestral score conducted by Nick Ingman; (2) &quot;The Passion of the Christ: Songs&quot;, by producers Mark Joseph and Tim Cook, with original compositions by various artists, and (3) &quot;Songs Inspired by The Passion of the Christ&quot;. The first two albums each received a 2005 Dove award, and the soundtrack received an Academy Award nomination of Best Original Music Score. The music score frequently makes use of the wailing woman technique.

A preliminary score was composed and recorded by Lisa Gerrard and Patrick Cassidy, but was incomplete at film&#x27;s release. Jack Lenz was the primary musical researcher and one of the composers; several clips of his compositions have been posted online.

===Title change===
Although Mel Gibson wanted to call his film &quot;The Passion&quot;, on October 16, 2003, his spokesman announced that the title used in the United States would be &quot;The Passion of Christ&quot; because Miramax Films had already registered the title &quot;The Passion&quot; with the MPAA for the 1987 novel by Jeanette Winterson. Later, the title was changed again to &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; for all markets.

===Distribution and marketing===
Gibson began production on his film without securing outside funding or distribution. In 2002, he explained why he could not get backing from the Hollywood studios: &quot;This is a film about something that nobody wants to touch, shot in two dead languages.&quot; Gibson and his company Icon Productions provided the film&#x27;s sole backing, spending about $30 million on production costs and an estimated $15 million on marketing. After early accusations of antisemitism, it became difficult for Gibson to find an American distribution company. 20th Century Fox initially had a first-look deal with Icon but decided to pass on the film in response to public protests; Fox did however release the film on domestic home media as well as in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. In order to avoid the spectacle of other studios turning down the film and to avoid subjecting the distributor to the same intense public criticism he had received, Gibson decided to distribute the film in the United States himself, with the aid of independent distributor Newmarket Films. Gibson handled the distribution and marketing on his own, whilst Newmarket assisted with shipping prints of the film and collecting the revenue from theaters.

Gibson departed from the usual film marketing formula. He employed a small-scale television advertising campaign with no press junkets. Similar to marketing campaigns for earlier biblical films like &quot;The King of Kings&quot;, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was heavily promoted by many church groups, both within their organizations and to the public. Typical licensed merchandise like posters, T-shirts, coffee mugs and jewelry was sold through retailers and websites. The United Methodist Church stated that many of its members, like other Christians, felt that the film was a good way to evangelize non-believers. As a result, many congregations planned to be at the theaters, and some set up tables to answer questions and share prayers. Rev. John Tanner, pastor of Cove United Methodist Church in Hampton Cove, Alabama, said: &quot;They feel the film presents a unique opportunity to share Christianity in a way today&#x27;s public can identify with.&quot; The Seventh-day Adventist Church also expressed a similar endorsement of the picture. More than a dozen Catholic bishops and cardinals issued statements praising the film.

===Evangelical support===
&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; received enthusiastic support from the American evangelical community. Before the film&#x27;s release, Gibson actively reached out to evangelical leaders seeking their support and feedback. With their help, Gibson organized and attended a series of pre-release screenings for evangelical audiences and discussed the making of the film and his personal faith. In June 2003 he screened the film for 800 pastors attending a leadership conference at New Life Church, pastored by Ted Haggard, then president of the National Association of Evangelicals. Gibson gave similar showings at Joel Osteen&#x27;s Lakewood Church, Greg Laurie&#x27;s Harvest Christian Fellowship, and to 3,600 pastors at a conference at Rick Warren&#x27;s Saddleback Church in Lake Forest.

From the summer of 2003 to the film&#x27;s release in February 2004, portions or rough cuts of the film were shown to over eighty audiences—many of which were evangelical audiences. The film additionally received public endorsements from evangelical leaders, including Rick Warren, Billy Graham, Robert Schuller, Darrell Bock, &quot;Christianity Today&quot; editor David Neff, Pat Robertson, Lee Strobel, Jerry Falwell, Max Lucado, Tim LaHaye and Chuck Colson.

==Release==
===Box office and theatrical run===
&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; opened in the United States on February 25, 2004 (Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent). It earned $83.8 million from 4,793 screens at 3,043 theaters in its opening weekend and a total of $125.2 million since its Wednesday opening, ranking it fourth overall in domestic opening weekend earnings for 2004 as well as the biggest weekend debut for a February release (until &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; was released). The film tied with &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;″s record for having the highest five-day Wednesday opening. Moreover, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; scored the second biggest opening weekend for any R-rated movie, behind &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. It went on to earn $370.8 million overall in the United States, and remained the highest grossing R-rated film in the domestic market (U.S. &amp; Canada) for 20 years, before the record went to &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; in 2024 with a domestic gross of $395.6 million. The film sold an estimated 59.6 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.

In the Philippines, a majority-Catholic country, the film was released on March 31, 2004, rated PG-13 by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) and endorsed by the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP).

In Malaysia, government censors initially banned it completely, but after Christian leaders protested, the restriction was lifted, but only for Christian audiences, allowing them to view the film in specially designated theaters. In Israel, the film was not banned. However, it never received theatrical distribution because no Israeli distributor would market it.

Despite the many controversies and refusals by some governments to allow the film to be viewed in wide release, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; earned $612 million worldwide. The film was also a relative success in certain countries with large Muslim populations, such as in Egypt, where it ranked 20th overall in its box office numbers for 2004. In addition, it witnessed immense popularity in countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates where political parallels with the Palestinian situation resonated with audiences. However, it was banned in Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for religious reasons, particularly for depicting Jesus contrary to Islamic teachings.

The film was the highest grossing non-English-language film of all time until 2017, when it was surpassed by &quot;Wolf Warrior 2&quot;.

===&quot;The Passion Recut&quot;===

&quot;The Passion Recut&quot;, a re-edited version, was released in theaters on March 11, 2005, with five minutes of the most explicit violence deleted, in hopes of attracting more viewers by making the film approachable to consumers who found the original cut too gruesome. President of Newmarket Films Bob Berney stated, &quot;I knew a lot of people that wanted to see it but couldn&#x27;t go...They were just too nervous or squeamish&quot;. Gibson explained his reasoning for this re-edited version: 

Gibson anticipated that the film would be rated PG-13 after he edited the film to bring it closer to that rating. Though despite the re-editing, the Motion Picture Association of America still deemed &quot;The Passion Recut&quot; too violent for the PG-13 rating. But because Newmarket is not an MPAA signatory and hence does not have to comply with MPAA guidelines, they decided to release the film as unrated. On the &quot;Passion Recut&#x27;s&quot; rating and appeal to wider audiences, Berney explained:

The film&#x27;s re-release was an &quot;experiment&quot; for Newmarket and Icon, since the companies hoped for a four-week showing that would extended through Easter Sunday (March 27). Had the experiment succeeded, Newmarket and Icon would have released the film every year around Easter. However, the shortened film showed for three weeks in 960 theaters for a box office total of $567,692, minuscule compared to the $612,054,428 of &quot;The Passion&quot;. The BBFC classified the recut with a 15 rating, lower than the original cut&#x27;s 18 rating.

====Differences====
During the scourging scene, the cat o&#x27; nine tails striking Jesus&#x27;s flesh that resulted in blood squirting and his flesh being dislodged was omitted. In the crucifixion scene, the Roman soldiers nailing Jesus with blood spurting is cut, and the soldier strenuously dislocating Jesus&#x27;s shoulder is trimmed; instead, the reaction shots of Mary and Jesus are shown. Incidentally, the scene in which the cross is flipped over and suspended in air was also deleted, due to viewers not understanding what they saw.

On this edit&#x27;s overall effect, Gibson further added, &quot;I have toned down some of the more brutal scenes without removing them or compromising the impact of the film. By softening some of its more wrenching aspects, I hope to make the film and its message of love available to a wider audience&quot;.

===Home media===
On August 31, 2004, the film was released on VHS and DVD in North America by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which initially passed on theatrical distribution. As with the original theatrical release, the film&#x27;s release on home video formats proved to be very popular. Early estimates indicated that over 2.4 million copies of the film were sold by 3:00p.m., with a total of 4.1 million copies on its first day of sale. The film was available on DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and on VHS tape with English subtitles. The film was released on Blu-ray in North America as a two-disc Definitive Edition set on February 17, 2009. It was also released on Blu-ray in Australia a week before Easter.

Although the original DVD release sold well, it contained no bonus features other than a trailer, which provoked speculation about how many buyers would wait for a special edition to be released. On January 30, 2007, a two-disc Definitive Edition was released in the North American markets, and March 26 of that year elsewhere. It contains several documentaries, soundtrack commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, the 2005 unrated version, and the original 2004 theatrical version.

The British version of the two-disc DVD contains two additional deleted scenes. In the first, Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem (at the eighth station of the cross) and falls to the ground as the women wail around him, and Simon of Cyrene attempts to hold up the cross and help up Jesus simultaneously. Afterwards, while both are holding up the cross, Jesus says to the women weeping for him, &quot;Do not weep for me, but for yourselves and for your children&quot;. In the second, Pilate washes his hands, turns to Caiaphas, and says: &quot;Look you to it&quot; (i.e., the Pharisees wish to have Jesus crucified). Pilate then turns to Abanader and says: &quot;Do as they wish&quot;. The scene next shows Pilate calling to his servant, who is carrying a wooden board on which Pilate writes, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews&quot;, in Latin and Hebrew. He then holds the board above his head in full view of Caiaphas, who after reading it challenges Pilate on its content. Pilate replies angrily to Caiaphas in non-subtitled Hebrew. The disc contains only two deleted scenes in total. No other scenes from the movie are shown on disc 2.

On February 7, 2017, 20th Century Fox re-released the film on Blu-ray and DVD featuring the theatrical version and the edited version (The Passion Recut), where the graphic violence is reduced. The theatrical version features English and Spanish dubs; this marks the first time the film has ever been dubbed in another language.

===Television broadcast===
On April 17, 2011 (Palm Sunday), Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) presented the film at 7:30 p.m. ET/PT, in the United States with multiple showings scheduled. The network had continued to air the film throughout the year, and particularly around Easter.

On March 29, 2013 (Good Friday), as a part of their special Holy Week programming, TV5 in the Philippines presented the Filipino-dubbed version of the film at 2:00p.m. (PST, UTC+8). Its total broadcast ran for two hours, but excluding the advertisements, it would only run up for approximately one hour instead of its full run time of two hours and six minutes. It ended at 4:00 p.m. It has been rated SPG by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) for themes, language and violence with some scenes censored for television. TV5 is the first broadcast network outside of the United States and dubbed the Vernacular Hebrew and Latin language to Filipino (through translating its supplied English subtitles).

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; holds an approval rating of 50% based on 276 critic reviews and an 80% rating based on more than 250,000 user reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Director Mel Gibson&#x27;s zeal is unmistakable, but &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; will leave many viewers emotionally drained rather than spiritually uplifted.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average of 47 out of 100, based on 44 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

In a positive review for &quot;Time&quot;, its critic Richard Corliss called &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; &quot;a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment.&quot; &quot;New York Press&quot; film critic Armond White praised Gibson&#x27;s direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality. White also noted that it was odd to see Director Mel Gibson offer audiences &quot;an intellectual challenge&quot; with the film. Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the movie four out of four stars, calling it &quot;the most violent film I have ever seen&quot; as well as reflecting on how it struck him, a former altar boy: &quot;What Gibson has provided for me, for the first time in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message—that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus—is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. Take it or leave it.&quot;

In a negative review, &quot;Slate&quot; magazine&#x27;s David Edelstein called it &quot;a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie&quot;, and Jami Bernard of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; felt it was &quot;the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot;, Robert Wilonsky stated that he found the movie &quot;too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; I swear I couldn&#x27;t find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read.&quot;

The June 2006 issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; the most controversial film of all time, followed by Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971). In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; listed it as one of the most &quot;ridiculously violent&quot; films of all time.

===Controversies===
====Questions of historical and biblical accuracy====
Despite criticisms that Gibson deliberately added material to the historical accounts of first-century Judea and biblical accounts of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion, some scholars defend the film as not being primarily concerned with historical accuracy. Biblical scholar Mark Goodacre protested that he could not find one documented example of Gibson explicitly claiming the film to be historically accurate. Gibson has been quoted as saying: &quot;I think that my first duty is to be as faithful as possible in telling the story so that it doesn&#x27;t contradict the Scriptures. Now, so long as it didn&#x27;t do that, I felt that I had a pretty wide berth for artistic interpretation, and to fill in some of the spaces with logic, with imagination, with various other readings.&quot; One such example is a scene in which Judas Iscariot is shown being tormented by demons in the form of children. Another scene shows Satan carrying a demonic baby during Christ&#x27;s flogging, construed as a perversion of traditional depictions of the Madonna and Child, and also as a representation of Satan and the Antichrist. Gibson&#x27;s description:

When asked about the film&#x27;s faithfulness to the account given in the New Testament, Father Augustine Di Noia of the Vatican&#x27;s Doctrinal Congregation replied: &quot;Mel Gibson&#x27;s film is not a documentary... but remains faithful to the fundamental structure common to all four accounts of the Gospels&quot; and &quot;Mel Gibson&#x27;s film is entirely faithful to the New Testament&quot;.

====Disputed papal endorsement====
On December 5, 2003, &quot;Passion of the Christ&quot; co-producer Stephen McEveety gave a rough cut of the film to Archbishop Stanisław Dziwisz, the pope&#x27;s secretary. Pope John Paul II watched the film in his private apartment with Archbishop Dziwisz that night, and later met with McEveety and Jan Michelini, an Italian and the movie&#x27;s assistant director. On December 17, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; columnist Peggy Noonan reported John Paul II had said &quot;It is as it was&quot;, citing McEveety, who said he heard it from Dziwisz. Noonan had emailed Joaquín Navarro-Valls, the head of the Vatican&#x27;s press office, for confirmation before writing her column, surprised that the &quot;famously close-mouthed&quot; Navarro-Valls had approved the use of the &quot;It is as it was&quot; quote, and his emailed response stated he had no other comment at that time. &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; journalist John L. Allen Jr. published a similar account on the same day, quoting an unnamed senior Vatican official. Reuters and the Associated Press independently confirmed the story, citing Vatican sources.

A dispute emerged a few days later, when an anonymous Vatican official told Catholic News Service &quot;There was no declaration, no judgment from the pope.&quot; But Allen defended his earlier reporting, saying that his official source was adamant about the veracity of the original story. Columnist Frank Rich for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the statement was &quot;being exploited by the Gibson camp&quot;, and that when he asked Michelini about the meeting, Michelini said Dziwisz had reported the pope&#x27;s words as &quot;It is as it was&quot;, and said the pope also called the film &quot;incredibile&quot;, an Italian word Michelini translated as &quot;amazing&quot;. The following day, Archbishop Dziwisz told CNS, &quot;The Holy Father told no one his opinion of this film.&quot; This denial resulted in a round of commentators who accused the film producers of fabricating a papal quote to market their movie.

According to Rod Dreher in the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, McEveety was sent an email from papal spokesman Navarro-Valls that supported the Noonan account, and suggested &quot;It is as it was&quot; could be used as the leitmotif in discussions on the film and said to &quot;Repeat the words again and again and again.&quot; Dreher emailed Navarro-Valls a copy of the email McEveety had received, and Navarro-Valls emailed Dreher back and said, &quot;I can categorically deny its authenticity.&quot; Dreher opined that either Mel Gibson&#x27;s camp had created &quot;a lollapalooza of a lie&quot;, or the Vatican was making reputable journalists and filmmakers look like &quot;sleazebags or dupes&quot; and he explained: 

Noonan noted that she and Dreher had discovered the emails were sent by &quot;an email server in the Vatican&#x27;s domain&quot; from a Vatican computer with the same IP address. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that, when it asked after the story first broke if the &quot;It is as it was&quot; quote was reliable, Navarro-Valls had responded &quot;I think you can consider that quote as accurate.&quot; Allen noted that while Dziwisz stated that Pope John Paul II made no declaration about this movie, other Vatican officials were &quot;continuing to insist&quot; the pope did say it, and other sources claimed they had heard Dziwisz say the pope said it on other occasions, and Allen called the situation &quot;kind of a mess&quot;. A representative from Gibson&#x27;s Icon Productions expressed surprise at Dziwisz&#x27;s statements after the correspondence and conversations between film representatives and the pope&#x27;s official spokesperson, Navarro-Valls, and stated &quot;there is no reason to believe that the pope&#x27;s support of the film &#x27;isn&#x27;t as it was.&#x27;&quot;

After speaking to Dziwisz, Navarro-Valls confirmed John Paul II had seen &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, and released the following official statement:
The film is a cinematographic transposition of the historical event of the Passion of Jesus Christ according to the accounts of the Gospel. It is a common practice of the Holy Father not to express public opinions on artistic works, opinions that are always open to different evaluations of aesthetic character.
In a follow-up column in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Noonan addressed the question of why the issues being raised were not just &quot;a tempest in a teapot&quot; and she explained:

====Allegations of antisemitism====
Before the film was released, there were prominent criticisms of perceived antisemitic content in the film. It was for that reason that 20th Century Fox decided to pass on the film, informing New York Assemblyman Dov Hikind that a protest outside the News Corporation Building made them decide against distributing the film. Hikind warned other companies that &quot;they should not distribute this film. This is unhealthy for Jews all over the world.&quot;

A joint committee of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Inter-religious Affairs of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Department of Inter-religious Affairs of the Anti-Defamation League obtained a version of the script before it was released in theaters. They released a statement, calling it one of the most troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in 25 years. It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest Caiaphas, who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed Pilate into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at Vatican II in its document &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.

The ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:
For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism. Absent such scholarly and theological understanding, productions such as &quot;The Passion&quot; could likely falsify history and fuel the of those who hate Jews. Rabbi Daniel Lapin, the head of the Toward Tradition organization, criticized this statement, and said of Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL, &quot;what he is saying is that the only way to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate your faith&quot;.

In &quot;The Nation&quot;, reviewer Katha Pollitt wrote: &quot;Gibson has violated just about every precept of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops own 1988 &#x27;Criteria&#x27; for the portrayal of Jews in dramatizations of the Passion (no bloodthirsty Jews, no rabble, no use of Scripture that reinforces negative stereotypes of Jews.) [...] The priests have big noses and gnarly faces, lumpish bodies, yellow teeth; Herod Antipas and his court are a bizarre collection of oily-haired, epicene perverts. The &#x27;good Jews&#x27; look like Italian movie stars (Magdalene actually &quot;is&quot; an Italian movie star, Monica Bellucci); Jesus&#x27;s mother, who would have been around 50 and appeared 70, could pass for a ripe 35.&quot; Jesuit priest Fr. William Fulco, S.J. of Loyola Marymount University—and the film&#x27;s translator for Hebrew dialogue—specifically disagreed with that assessment, and disagreed with concerns that the film accused the Jewish community of deicide.

In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Jewish biblical scholar and expert on the historical Jesus, Géza Vermes wrote a highly critical review of the movie: he stated that the movie is &quot;horribly gory, historically wrong - and it will inspire judeophobia&quot;. According to Vermes, &quot;the real problem is not with his attitudes or avowed intentions, but with the lack of appropriate steps taken to prevent visual images from inspiring judeophobia. Caiaphas and his priestly colleagues often struggle not to smile when they see the defeat of Christ. In the film they allow their policemen to beat him up in open court without protest. In the Gospels itself they are depicted as doing things according to the book and reject the witnesses who testify against Jesus. This does not seem to be so in the film. These are dangerous opportunities for inspiring vengeful sentiments&quot;.

One specific scene in the film perceived as an example of anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states &quot;His blood [is] on us and on our children!&quot; (Mt 27:25), a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: &quot;I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn&#x27;t include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they&#x27;d be coming after me at my house. They&#x27;d come to kill me.&quot; In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s one little passage, and I believe it, but I don&#x27;t and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It&#x27;s directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that&#x27;s what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit that one of the reasons I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it&#x27;s true, is that I didn&#x27;t want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn&#x27;t be said.&quot;

The allegations of antisemitism were satirized in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;The Passion of the Jew&quot;, which focuses on the reactions of the protagonists to the film. In the episode, Eric Cartman leads a neo-Nazi rally whilst dressed as Adolf Hitler, Kyle Broflovski has nightmares about the excessive violence and complains about the Jews&#x27; apparent responsibility for the death of Jesus, and Stan Marsh and Kenny McCormick go to Mel Gibson to get a refund.

Allegations of the film&#x27;s antisemitism were intensified after Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2006 arrest for driving under the influence in Malibu, California, where during the arrest, he made antisemitic remarks against the arresting officer. He was recorded saying to the officer, &quot;Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?&quot;

====Reactions to allegations of antisemitism====

Film critic Roger Ebert, who awarded &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; four out of four stars in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, denied allegations that the film was anti-semitic. Ebert described the film as &quot;a powerful and important film, helmed by a man with a sincere heart and a warrior&#x27;s sense of justice. It is a story filled with searing images and ultimately a message of redemption and hope.&quot; Ebert said, &quot;It also might just be the greatest cinematic version of the greatest story ever told.&quot;

Conservative columnist Cal Thomas also disagreed with allegations of antisemitism and wrote in &quot;Townhall&quot;: &quot;To those in the Jewish community who worry that the film might contain anti-Semitic elements, or encourage people to persecute Jews, fear not. The film does not indict Jews for the death of Jesus.&quot;

Bob Smithouser of Focus on the Family&#x27;s &quot;Plugged In&quot; also believed that the film was trying to convey the evils and sins of humanity rather than specifically targeting Jews, stating: &quot;The anthropomorphic portrayal of Satan as a player in these events brilliantly pulls the proceedings into the supernatural realm—a fact that should have quelled the much-publicized cries of anti-Semitism since it shows a diabolical force at work beyond any political and religious agendas of the Jews and Romans.&quot;

Moreover, senior officer at the Vatican Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, who had seen the film, addressed the matter so:
Anti-Semitism, like all forms of racism, distorts the truth in order to put a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the historical objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.

Asked by Bill O&#x27;Reilly if his movie would &quot;upset Jews&quot;, Gibson responded, &quot;It&#x27;s not meant to. I think it&#x27;s meant to just tell the truth. I want to be as truthful as possible.&quot; In an interview for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, he added: &quot;If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it&#x27;s in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The Papacy has condemned racism in any form...Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I&#x27;ll be the first on the line for culpability.&quot;

====Criticism of excessive violence====
A.O. Scott in &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; is so relentlessly focused on the savagery of Jesus&#x27; final hours that this film seems to arise less from love than from wrath, and to succeed more in assaulting the spirit than in uplifting it.&quot; David Edelstein, &quot;Slate&quot;″s film critic, dubbed the film &quot;a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie—&quot;The Jesus Chainsaw Massacre&quot;—that thinks it&#x27;s an act of faith&quot;, and further criticized Gibson for focusing on the brutality of Jesus&#x27; execution, instead of his religious teachings.

In 2008, writer Michael Gurnow in American Atheists stated much the same, labeling the work a mainstream snuff film. Critic Armond White, in his review of the film for Africana.com, offered another perspective on the violence in the film. He wrote, &quot;Surely Gibson knows (better than anyone in Hollywood is willing to admit) that violence sells. It&#x27;s problematic that this time, Gibson has made a film that asks for a sensitive, serious, personal response to violence rather than his usual glorifying of vengeance.&quot;

During Diane Sawyer&#x27;s interview of him, Gibson said:
I wanted it to be shocking; and I wanted it to be extreme...So that they see the enormity of that sacrifice; to see that someone could endure that and still come back with love and forgiveness, even through extreme pain and suffering and ridicule. The actual crucifixion was more violent than what was shown on the film, but I thought no one would get anything out of it.

==Sequel==
Reports and rumors of a sequel have circulated for years. In June 2016, writer Randall Wallace stated that he and Gibson had begun work on a sequel to &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; which will focus on the resurrection of Jesus, and the events surrounding the resurrection. In 2018, Caviezel said that Gibson had sent him the third draft of the screenplay. In 2020, Caviezel said that it would be titled &quot;The Passion of the Christ: Resurrection&quot; and predicted, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be the biggest film in world history.&quot;

In July 2023, Gibson stated that the sequel was &quot;coming soon&quot;, and that he was working on two versions of the script, saying, &quot;one of them is a very structured and very strong script and kind of more what one should expect and the other is like an acid trip.&quot;

In September 2024, Gibson had reportedly begun scouting various locations with a production team in Europe.

In January 2025, during an appearance on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;, Gibson announced the film&#x27;s title as &quot;The Resurrection of the Christ&quot;. When Rogan asked if he would be recasting the lead character, Gibson confirmed that Caviezel will reprise the role, and added that the use of CGI and various special effects would be used to allow the actor to appear the same age.

In February 2025, it was revealed that filming starts in March 2025. A press release has revealed that Caviezel, who will reprise his role as Jesus in the sequel, is “just a month out from starting production on ‘The Resurrection.”

According to the report, an Italian outlet has Gibson scheduled to arrive in the southern Province of Matera to shoot scenes in April 2025. In February 2025, Production Weekly states there will be a &quot;&quot;March shoot, spanning three countries (Italy, Mexico and Malta)&quot;.&quot;

<text>Coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG, pronounced &quot;cabbage&quot;), is a surgical procedure to treat coronary artery disease (CAD), the buildup of plaques in the arteries of the heart. It can relieve chest pain caused by CAD, slow the progression of CAD, and increase life expectancy. It aims to bypass narrowings in heart arteries by using arteries or veins harvested from other parts of the body, thus restoring adequate blood supply to the previously ischemic (deprived of blood) heart.

There are two main approaches. The first uses a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, a machine which takes over the functions of the heart and lungs during surgery by circulating blood and oxygen. With the heart in cardioplegic arrest, harvested arteries and veins are used to connect across problematic regions—a construction known as surgical anastomosis. In the second approach, called the off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB), these anastomoses are constructed while the heart is still beating. The anastomosis supplying the left anterior descending branch is the most significant one and usually, the left internal mammary artery is harvested for use. Other commonly employed sources are the right internal mammary artery, the radial artery, and the great saphenous vein.

Effective ways to treat chest pain (specifically, angina, a common symptom of CAD) have been sought since the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1960s, CABG was introduced in its modern form and has since become the main treatment for significant CAD. Significant complications of the operation include bleeding, heart problems (heart attack, arrhythmias), stroke, infections (often pneumonia) and injury to the kidneys.

== Uses ==

Coronary artery bypass surgery aims to prevent death from coronary artery disease and improve quality of life by relieving angina, the associated feeling of chest pain. The decision to perform surgery is informed by studies of CABG&#x27;s efficacy in different patient subgroups, based on the lesions&#x27; anatomy or how well the heart is functioning. These results are compared with that of other strategies, most importantly percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

=== Coronary artery disease ===
Coronary artery disease is caused when coronary arteries of the heart accumulate atheromatous plaques, causing stenosis (narrowing) in one or more arteries and risking myocardial infarction, the interruption of blood supply to the heart. CAD can occur in any of the major vessels of the coronary circulation: the left main stem, left ascending artery, circumflex artery, and right coronary artery, and branches thereof. CAD symptoms vary from none, to chest pain only when exercising (stable angina), to chest pain even at rest (unstable angina). It can even manifest as a myocardial infarction; if blood flow to the heart is not restored within a few hours, whether spontaneously or by medical intervention, the blood-deprived part of the heart becomes necrotic (dies) and is scarred. It may lead to other complications such as arrhythmias, rupture of the papillary muscles of the heart, or sudden death.

There are various methods of detecting and assessing CAD. Apart from history and clinical examination, noninvasive methods include electrocardiography (ECG) at rest or during exercise, and X-ray of the chest. Echocardiography can quantify heart functioning by measuring, for example, enlargement of the left ventricle, the ejection fraction, and the situation of the heart valves. The most accurate ways to detect CAD are the coronary angiogram and the coronary CT angiography. An angiogram can provide detailed anatomy of coronary circulation and lesions. The significance of each lesion is determined by the diameter loss. A diameter loss of 50% translates to a 75% cross-sectional area loss, considered moderate by most groups. Severe stenosis constitutes a diameter loss of 2/3 or more—a greater-than-90% loss of cross-sectional area. To more accurately determine the severity of stenosis, interventional cardiologists may also employ intravascular ultrasound, which can determine the severity and provide information on the composition of the atheromatous plaque. With the technique of fractional flow reserve, the pressure after the stenosis is compared to mean aortic pressure. If the ratio is less than 0.80, then the stenosis is deemed significant.

=== Indications for CABG ===
====Stable patients====
People with angina during exercise are usually first treated with medical therapy. Noninvasive tests help estimate which patients might benefit from undergoing coronary angiography. Generally, if portions of cardiac wall are receiving less blood than normal, coronary angiography is indicated; then, lesions are identified and inform a decision to undergo PCI or CABG.

CABG is generally preferred over PCI when there is a significant burden of plaque on the coronary arteries, that is extensive and complex, due to survival benefit. Other indicators that a patient will benefit more from CABG rather than PCI include: decreased left-ventricle function; left main disease; diabetes; and complex triple system disease (including LAD, Cx and RCA), especially when the lesion in the LAD is at its proximal part.

====Acute coronary syndrome====
During an acute heart event, known as acute coronary syndrome, it is paramount to quickly restore blood flow to heart tissue. Typically, patients arrive at the hospital with chest pain. They are first treated with drugs, particularly the strongest drugs that prevent clots within vessels (dual anti-platelet therapy: aspirin and clopidogrel). Patients at risk of ongoing ischemia undergo PCI to restore blood flow and thus oxygen delivery to the struggling heart. If PCI failed to restore blood flow because of anatomical considerations or other technical problems, urgent CABG is indicated to save heart tissue. The timing of the operation plays a role in survival: It is preferable to delay the surgery if possible (three days if the infarction affecting the total thickness of the cardiac muscle, and six hours if it does not).

CABG is also indicated when there are mechanical complications of an infarction (ventricular septal defect, papillary muscle rupture or myocardial rupture). There are no absolute contraindications of CABG, but severe disease of other organs such as the liver or brain, limited life expectancy, and patient fragility are considered.

====Other cardiac surgery====

CABG is also performed when a patient is to undergo another cardiac surgical procedure, most commonly for valve disease, and angiography reveals a significant lesion of the coronary arteries. CABG can also address dissection of coronary arteries, where a rupture of the coronary layers creates a pseudo-lumen (cavity) and diminishes blood delivery to the heart. Such a dissection may be caused by pregnancy, tissue diseases like Ehlers–Danlos syndromes and Marfan syndrome, cocaine abuse, or PCI. A coronary aneurysm may also indicate CABG: A blood clot might develop within the vessel and travel downstream.

===CABG versus PCI===
CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are the two methods to restore blood flow caused by stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries. The choice of method is still a matter of debate, but it is clear that in the presence of complex lesions, significant left main disease, or diabetes, CABG yields better long-term survival and outcomes. Strong indications for CABG also include symptomatic patients and impaired left ventricle function. CABG offers better results than PCI in left main disease and in CAD that affects multiple vessels, because of the protection arterial conduits offer to the native arteries of the heart, by producing vasodilator factors and preventing the advancement of plaques. Studies published in 2023 show that CABG in patients with left main disease is associated with lower mortality and fewer adverse events compared to PCI.

Patients with unprotected left main disease—when the runoff of the left main artery is not protected by a patent graft since a previous CABG operation—have been studied as a group. A 2016 European study found that in these patients, CABG outperforms PCI in the long run (5 years). Another 2016 study found that PCI has similar results to CABG at 3 years, but that CABG becomes better than PCI after 4 years.

A 2012 trial and followup in diabetic patients demonstrated a significant advantage to CABG over PCI. The relative advantage remained evident at 3.8-year and 7.5-year follow ups, which found particular benefits in smokers and younger patients. A 2015 trial compared CABG and the latest technological advancement of PCI, second-generation drug-eluting stents in multivessel disease. Their results indicated that CABG is a better option for CAD patients. A trial published in 2021, comparing results after one year, also concluded that CABG is a safer option than PCI. A large study published in 2023 showed that PCI patients had higher mortality than CABG patients with left main coronary artery disease.

==Procedure==

=== Preoperative examination and strategy ===

Routine preoperative examination aims to check the status of systems and organs besides the heart. The examination typically includes a chest X-ray to check the lungs, a complete blood count, and kidney and liver function tests. Physical examination to determine the quality of the grafts or the safety of removing them, such as varicosities in the legs, or the Allen test in the arm is performed to be sure that blood supply to the arm will not be critically disturbed.

A patient taking anticoagulants—aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelol and others—will stop taking them several days before, to prevent excessive bleeding during and after the operation. Warfarin is also stopped for the same reason and the patient starts taking heparin products after the INR falls below 2.0.

After the angiogram is reviewed by the surgical team, targets are selected (that is, which native arteries will be bypassed and where the anastomosis should be placed). Ideally, all major lesions in significant vessels should be addressed. Most commonly, the left internal thoracic artery (LITA; formerly, left internal mammary artery, LIMA) is anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) because the LAD is the most significant artery of the heart and supplies blood to a larger portion of myocardium than other arteries.

A conduit can be used to graft one or more native arteries. In the latter case, an end-to-side anastomosis is performed. In the former, using a sequential anastomosis, a graft can then deliver blood to two or more native vessels of the heart. Also, the proximal part of a conduit can be anastomosed to the side of another conduit. It is preferred not to harvest too much conduit because it might necessitate re-operation.

=== With cardiopulmonary bypass machine (on-pump) ===

The intubated patient is brought to the operating theater. Lines (e.g., peripheral IV cannulae, central lines such as internal jugular cannulae) are inserted for drug administration and monitoring. A description of a traditional CABG follows.

; Harvesting
An incision in the sternum is made while vessels are being harvested, either from the arms or chest or from the leg, usually from the internal mammary artery or the saphenous vein. The LITA is harvested through the sternotomy. There are two common ways of mobilizing the LITA: the pedicle (i.e., a pedicle consisting of the artery plus surrounding fat and veins) and the skeletonized (i.e., freed of other tissues). Before the LITA is divided in its more distal part, the anticoagulant heparin is administered to the patient via a peripheral line, to prevent clots.

; Catheterization and establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass
After harvesting, the pericardium—the sac that surrounds the heart—is opened and stay sutures are placed to keep it open. Purse string sutures are placed in the aorta to prepare the insertions of the cannula into the aorta, and a catheter which temporarily arrests the heart using a solution high in potassium. Another purse string is placed in the right atrium for the venous cannula. Once the cannulas and the catheter are placed, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is commenced. Deoxygenated blood arriving to the heart from veins is forwarded to the CPB machine to get oxygenated, then delivered to the aorta to keep the rest of the body saturated. The blood is often cooled to to slow metabolism and minimize the demand for oxygen. A clamp is placed on the aorta between the cardioplegic catheter and aortic cannula, so that the flow of cardioplegic solution may be controlled by adjusting the clamp. Within minutes, the heart stops beating.

; Anastomosis (grafting)
With the heart still, the tip of the heart is taken out of pericardium so that native arteries lying on the posterior side of the heart are accessible. Usually, distal anastomoses are constructed first (first to the right coronary system, then to the circumflex) and then the sequential anastomosis if necessary. Surgeons check the anastomosis for patency (whether it is sufficiently open) or leaking. They then insert the graft within the pericardium, sometimes attached to the cardioplegic catheter. The anastomosis of the LIMA to the LAD is usually the last distal anastomosis to be constructed; while it is being constructed the blood rewarming process starts (by the CPB). After the anastomosis is completed and checked for leaks, the proximal anastomoses of the conduits, if any, are next. They can be done either with the clamp still on, or after removing the aortic clamp and isolating a small segment of the aorta by placing a partial clamp. That said, aortas burdened by plaques might be damaged or release atheromatous debris by being overhandled.

; Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and closure
After the proximal anastomoses are done, the clamp is removed and the aorta and conduits de-aired. Pacing wires, which supply a current to assist the heartbeat, might be placed. If the heart and other systems are functioning, CPB is discontinued and cannulae are removed. Protamine is administered to reverse the effect of the anticoagulant heparin. After possible bleeding sites are checked, chest tubes are placed and the sternum is closed.

===Off-pump===

Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery avoids using the CPB machine by stabilizing small segments of the heart at a time. The surgical team and anesthesiologists must coordinate and take great care to not manipulate the heart too much, lest they compromise the stability of blood flow. Compromise should be detected immediately and appropriate action taken.

Keeping a healthy heartbeat may involve maneuvers like placing atrial wires to protect from bradycardia, or by placing stitches or incisions into the pericardium to help exposure. Snares and tapes are used to facilitate exposure. The aim is to avoid distal ischemia caused by blockage of the vessel supplying distal portions of the left ventricle, so usually LITA to LAD is the first to be anastomosed and others follow. For the anastomosis, a fine tube blowing humidified CO2 keeps the surgical field clean of blood. Also, a shunt might be used so the blood can travel past the site of anastomosis. After the distal anastomoses are completed, proximal anastomoses to the aorta are constructed with a partially closed aortic clamp. The rest of the process is similar to on-pump CABG.

=== Alternative approaches and special situations ===
When CABG is performed as an emergency because of a myocardial infarction, the highest priority is to salvage the struggling myocardium. Before operation, an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) might be inserted to relieve some of the burden of pumping blood, effectively reducing the amount of oxygen needed by myocardium. During operation, the standard practice is to place the patient on CPB as soon as possible and revascularize the heart with three saphenous veins. A calcified aorta also poses a problem because it is very dangerous to clamp. In this case, the operation can be done as an off-pump CAB using both inferior mesenteric arteries (IMA) or Y, T and sequential grafts. Deep arrest may be induced with hypothermia, lowering the temperature of the body to slightly above . In cases where a significant artery is totally blocked, it may be possible to remove the plaque and use the same hole in the artery to perform an anastomosis. This technique is called endarterectomy and is usually performed at the right coronary system.

Re-operations of CABG (another CABG operation after a previous one) pose difficulties. The heart may be positioned too close to the sternum and thus at risk when cutting the sternum again, so an oscillating saw is used. The heart may be covered with strong adhesions to adjusting structures. Doctors must decide whether aging grafts should be replaced. Manipulation of vein grafts is avoided because it risks dislodgement of plaque.

Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) strives to avoid a large incision in the sternum. It utilizes off-pump techniques to place a graft, usually of the LIMA at the LAD. The LIMA is freed through an incision between the left ribs (thoractomy), or even using an endoscope placed in the left chest. Robot-assisted coronary revascularization, which is not yet widely used, avoids the sternum incision to prevent infections and bleeding. Both conduit harvesting and the anastomosis are performed with the aid of a robot, through a thoracotomy. Usually, the procedure is combined with hybrid coronary revascularization, in which methods of CABG and PCI are both employed. Anastomosis of the LIMA to the LAD is performed in the operating theater and other lesions are treated with PCI—either at the operating room immediately following the anastomosis, or several days later.

== Post-operative care ==
After the procedure, the patient is usually transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where intubations are removed if not already done in the operating theater. They usually exit the ICU by the following day, and four days later, if no complications occur, the patient is discharged from the hospital.

A series of drugs are commonly used in early post-operative care. Dobutamine, a beta agent, can increase the cardiac output and is administered some hours after the operation. Beta blockers are used to prevent atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular arrhythmias. Pacing wires attached to both atria, inserted during the operation, may help prevent atrial fibrillation. Aspirin (80 mg) is used to prevent graft failure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are used to control blood pressure, especially in patients with low cardiac function (&lt;40%). Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is used for patients whose radial artery was used as a graft.

After the discharge, patients may experience insomnia, low appetite, decreased sex drive, and memory problems. This effect is usually transient and lasts 6 to 8 weeks. A tailored exercise plan is usually beneficial.

==Results==

CABG is the best procedure to reduce mortality from severe CAD and improve quality of life. Operative mortality strongly relates to the patient&#x27;s age. According to a study by Eagle &quot;et al&quot;., patients 50–59 years old have an operative mortality rate of 1.8%, while patients older than 80 have a rate of 8.3%. Other factors that increase mortality are being female, re-operation, dysfunction of the left ventricle, and left main disease. CABG usually relieves angina, but in some patients it reoccurs. Around 60% of patients will be angina-free 10 years after their operation. Myocardial infarction is rare five years after a CABG, but its risk increases with time. The risk of sudden death for CABG patients is low. Quality of life is also high for at least five years, then can slowly start to decline. However, the use of bilateral mammary artery in patients of younger age and those without specific comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, steroid use) can provide excellent long-term survival and quality of life.

The beneficial effects of CABG are clear at the cardiac level. Left-ventricle function is improved and malfunctioning segments of the heart—dyskinetic (moving inefficiently) or even akinetic (not moving)—can show signs of improvement. Both systolic and diastolic functions are improved and keep improving for up to five years in some cases. Left-ventricle function and myocardial perfusion during exercise also improves after CABG. When the left ventricle is severely impaired before operation (ejection fraction below 30%), however, benefits are less impressive in terms of segmental wall movement but still significant because other parameters might improve as LV function improves; the pulmonary hypertension might be relieved and lengthen survival.

Determining the total risk of the procedure is difficult because of the diversity of patients undergoing CABG; different subgroups have different risk, but younger patients see better results than older ones. A CABG using two, rather than one, internal mammary arteries (IMAs) may offer greater protection from CAD, but results are not yet conclusive.

===Grafts===
Conduits that can be used for CABG may be arteries or veins. Arteries have a superior long-term patency (expandedness), but veins are more commonly used due to their practicality.

Arterial grafts originate from the part of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) that runs near the edge of sternum, and can easily be mobilized and anastomosed to the native target vessel of the heart. The left artery is most often used because it is closer to the heart, but the right artery is sometimes used, depending on patient and surgeon preferences. The ITAs are advantageous because of their endothelial cells, which produce endothelium-derived relaxing factor and prostacyclin, protecting the artery from atherosclerosis and thus stenosis or occlusion. Disadvantages include a high rate of complications, such as deep sternal wound infections, in some subgroups of patients—mainly obese and diabetic ones. The left radial artery and left gastroepiploic artery can be also used. Long-term patency is influenced by the type of artery used and intrinsic factors of the cardiac arterial circulation.

Veins used are mostly great saphenous veins and, in some cases, the lesser saphenous vein. Their patency rate is lower than that of arteries. Aspirin protects grafts from occlusion; adding clopidogrel does not improve rates.

===Compared to PCI===
CABG and PCI are the two methods to revascularize stenotic lesions of the cardiac arteries. The preferences for each patient is still a matter of debate but in the presence of complex lesions and significant Left Main Disease, and in diabetic patients, CABG seems to offer better results in patients than PCI. Strong indications for CABG also include symptomatic patients and those with impaired LV function.

==Complications==

The most common complications of CABG are postoperative bleeding, heart failure, atrial fibrillation (a form of arrhythmia), stroke, kidney dysfunction, and infection of the wound near the sternum.

Postoperative bleeding occurs in 2–5% of cases and may require returning to the operating room; the most common indicator is the amount of blood being drained by chest tubes, which are inserted during the operation to drain fluid or air from the chest. Bleeding may originate from the aorta, the anastomosis, an insufficiently sealed branch of the conduit, or from the sternum. Other causes include platelet abnormalities or their failure to clot—perhaps due to the bypass or to the rebound heparin effect, which occurs when the anti-coagulant heparin is administered at the beginning of surgery and reappears in the blood after its neutralization by protamine.

Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) can occur in up to 14% of CABG patients. According to its severity, LCOS is treated with inotropes, an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), optimization of pre-load and afterload, or correction of blood gauzes and electrolytes. The aim is to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90mmHg and a cardiac index of more than 2.2 L/min/m2. LCOS is often transient. Myocardial infarction can occur after the operation because of either technical or patient-specific factors. Its incidence is difficult to estimate due to varying definitions, but most studies place its occurrence at between 2% and 5%. The incidence is also dependent on whether it is isolated CABG (average, 4%, range, 0.3%–10%) or a combined operation (average, 2.0%, range, 0.7%–12%). New electrocardiogram features, such as Q waves or ultrasound-documented alternation of cardiac wall motions, are indicative. Ongoing ischemia might prompt emergency angiography and PCI or re-operation. Immediate coronary angiography offers the most expeditious modality not only for diagnosis but also for potential reintervention. Echocardiography is less valuable for the detection or confirmation of postoperative myocardial ischemia. Arrhythmias can also occur, most-commonly atrial fibrillation (incidence of 20–40%) that is treated with correcting electrolyte balance, and rate and rhythm control. However, arrhythmia such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation can be a sign of postoperative myocardial ischemia that is treated depending on the cause.

Adverse neurological effects occur after CABG in about 1.5% of patients. They can manifest as type-1 deficits—focal deficits such as stroke or coma—or type-2 global deficits such as delirium caused by CPB, hypoperfusion, or cerebral embolism. Cognitive impairment has been reported in up to 80% cases after CABG at discharge and lasts for a year in up to 40% of cases. The cause remains unclear; CPB is an unlikely cause because even in CABG patients without CPB, as in off-pump CABG, and PCI patients, the incidence is the same.

Infections, such as wound infections in the sternum (superficial or deep) are most commonly caused by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and may complicate the post-operation process. The harvesting of both two thoracic arteries is a risk factor because it significantly impairs the perfusion of blood through the sternum. Pneumonia can also occur. Complications in the gastrointestinal tract have been described and are most commonly due to medications administered during the operation.

==History==

===Pre-CABG===
In the early 20th century, surgical interventions aiming to relieve angina and prevent death were either sympathectomy — a cut on the sympathetic chain that supplies the heart—or pericardial abrasion, with the hope adhesions would create significant collateral circulation. Sympathectomy produced disappointing and inconsistent results. French surgeon Alexis Carrel was the first to anastomose a vessel—a branch of the carotid artery—to a native artery in the heart of a dog, but the experiment could not be reproduced. In the mid-20th century, revascularization efforts continued. Beck C. S. used a carotid conduit to connect the descending aorta to the coronary sinus, the biggest vein of the heart. In the &quot;Vineberg Procedure&quot;, Arthur Vineberg used skeletonized LITA, placing it in a small tunnel he created next to the LAD and hoping spontaneous collateral circulation would form. This occurred in canine experiments but not in humans. Goetz RH was the first to perform an anastomosis of the ITA to LAD in the 1960 using a sutureless technique.

The development of coronary angiography in 1962 by Mason Sones helped medical doctors to identify patients in need of operation, and which native heart vessels should be bypassed. In 1964, Soviet cardiac surgeon Vasilii Kolesov performed the first successful internal thoracic artery–coronary artery anastomosis, followed by Michael DeBakey in the United States. Argentine surgeon René Favaloro standardized the procedure. Their advances made CABG the standard of care of CAD patients.

===The CABG era===

The modern era of the CABG began in 1964 when Soviet cardiac surgeon Vasilii Kolesov performed the first successful internal thoracic artery–coronary artery anastomosis. The same year, American surgeon Michael DeBakey used a saphenous vein to create an aorta-coronary artery bypass. Argentinean surgeon René Favaloro advanced and standardized the CABG technique using the patient&#x27;s saphenous vein.

The introduction of arresting the heart during operation (cardioplegia) made CABG much less risky. A major obstacle of CABG was ischemia and infarction occurring while the heart was stopped to allow surgeons to construct the distal anastomosis. In the 1970s, potassium-based cardioplegia was used. Cardioplegia minimized the oxygen demands of the heart, thus reducing the effects of ischemia. Refinement of cardioplegia in the 1980s made CABG less risky, lowering mortality during operation.

In the late 1960s, after the work of René Favaloro, the operation was performed in only a few centers, but was anticipated to more broadly change the outcome of coronary artery disease. By 1979, there were 114,000 procedures per year in the US. The introduction of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) did not obsolesce CABG; rates of both procedures continued to increase, but PCIs grew more rapidly. In the following decades, CABG was extensively studied and compared to PCI. The absence of a clear advantage of CABG over PCI led to a small decrease in numbers of CABGs in some countries (like the US) by 2000. In Europe—mainly Germany—CABG was increasingly performed. , research comparing the two techniques is continuing. Meta-analysis published in 2023 suggests that CABG provides a consistent survival benefit over PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES).

Favaloro&#x27;s work is fundamental to the history of graft selection. He established the use of bilateral ITAs as superior to vein grafts. Surgeons examined the use of other arterial grafts—splenic, gastroepiploic mesenteric, subscapular and others—but none matched the patency rates of ITA. In 1971, Carpentier introduced the use of the radial artery, which was initially prone to failure, but the development of harvesting techniques in the following 20 years significantly improved patency.
==Other animals==

Pigs, sheep, and dogs have been used as experimental models, for the development of CABG. Performing CABG to treat a sick animal though is extremely rare.

<doc id="195257" wikidata="Q4637435" url="?curid=195257" title="40oz. to Freedom">
<text>40oz. to Freedom is the debut studio album by American ska punk band Sublime, released on June 1, 1992, on Skunk Records. It was later reissued by MCA. &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot;″s sound blended various forms of Jamaican music, including ska (&quot;Date Rape&quot;), rocksteady (&quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot;), roots reggae (&quot;Smoke Two Joints&quot;), and dub (&quot;Let&#x27;s Go Get Stoned&quot;, &quot;D.J.s&quot;) along with hardcore punk (&quot;New Thrash&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;) and hip hop (as in &quot;Live at E&#x27;s&quot;).

&quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; received mixed reviews from critics upon release, but has since earned an improved public perception. Sublime would not achieve any mainstream success until the release of their self-titled album in 1996, two months after the death of Bradley Nowell. As of 2011, the album has certified sales of two million copies in the US. It is Sublime&#x27;s second bestselling studio album there; the self-titled album leads with six million. Along with the Offspring&#x27;s album &quot;Smash&quot;, &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; is one of the highest-selling independently released albums of all time.

== Background ==
At the age of sixteen, Bradley Nowell began playing guitar and started his first band, Hogan&#x27;s Heroes, with Michael Yates and Eric Wilson, who would later become Sublime&#x27;s bassist. At first, Wilson did not share Nowell&#x27;s interest in reggae music. Nowell recalled the experience: &quot;I was trying to get them to do (UB40&#x27;s version of) &#x27;Cherry Oh Baby&#x27;, and it didn&#x27;t work. They tried, but it just sounded like such garbage. We were horrible.&quot;

In 1990, music student Michael &quot;Miguel&quot; Happoldt approached the band, offering to let the band record in the studio at the school where Happoldt was studying. The band enthusiastically agreed and broke into the school at night, where they recorded from midnight to seven in the morning. The recording session resulted in the popular cassette tape called &quot;Jah Won&#x27;t Pay the Bills&quot;, which was released in 1991. The tape helped the band gain a grassroots following throughout Southern California. Using the same tactics implemented for the recording of &quot;Jah Won&#x27;t Pay the Bills&quot;, the band recorded &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; in secrecy at the studios in California State University, Dominguez Hills. Nowell recalled &quot;You weren&#x27;t supposed to be in there after 9 p.m., but we&#x27;d go in at 9:30 and stay until 5 in the morning. We&#x27;d just hide from the security guards. They never knew we were there. We managed to get $30,000 worth of studio time for free.&quot;

== Influences ==
Sublime themselves credit a number of local reggae and rap bands from California for inspiration in their Thanx Dub. In addition to explicit mentions of artists like KRS-One and Half Pint, Nowell makes copious allusions to others through his lyrics. The line &quot;Stolen from an Africa land&quot; in &quot;Don&#x27;t Push&quot;, for example, alludes to Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot;. References are also made to Boomtown Rats, Eazy-E, Beastie Boys, Tenor Saw, Pink Floyd, The Specials, The Ziggens, Minutemen, Jimi Hendrix, Just-Ice, Fishbone, Public Enemy, and Flavor Flav, among others.

The album has six covers: 
* &quot;Smoke Two Joints&quot; (by The Toyes)
* &quot;We&#x27;re Only Gonna Die&quot; (by Bad Religion)
* &quot;54-46 That&#x27;s My Number&quot; (by Toots &amp; the Maytals)
* &quot;Scarlet Begonias&quot; (by Grateful Dead)
* &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; (by The Melodians)
* &quot;Hope&quot; (by Descendents)

The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Push&quot; contains lyrics from the Beastie Boys song &quot;Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun&quot;. 
The song &quot;D.J.s&quot; contains a lyric from Bob Marley&#x27;s &quot;Ride Natty Ride&quot; with &quot;Dred gotta a job to do&quot;. The song &quot;D.J.s&quot; closes with lyrics from the Dandy Livingstone song &quot;Rudy, A Message to You&quot; which was popularized by The Specials, another band often credited as a Sublime influence. 
In &quot;New Thrash,&quot; the words &quot;There ain&#x27;t no life nowhere&quot; can be heard in the background, a reference to the Jimi Hendrix Experience song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot; where the same words can be heard. 
&quot;New Song&quot; starts similarly to the 1990 song &#x27;The Nigga Ya Love To Hate&#x27; by Ice Cube, with the line &quot;I heard that payback&#x27;s a motherfuckin bitch&quot;.

== Release history ==

The album was originally released by Skunk Records on compact disc and cassette. The original cassette version contained a longer version of the track &quot;Thanx&quot;; the cassette version was 5:56, while the length was 4:23 on all other releases of the album. A longer instrumental version of the recording appears on the compilation &quot;Second-hand Smoke&quot; as &quot;Thanx Dub&quot;, with a length of 6:28.

The album was reissued by Gasoline Alley Records and MCA with a different track listing, removing the song &quot;Get Out!&quot; and the hidden track &quot;Rawhide&quot; due to copyright issues — &quot;Get Out!&quot; contained unlicensed samples, and &quot;Rawhide&quot;, which appeared at the end of &quot;Date Rape&quot;, was an uncredited cover of the theme to the TV series of the same name. However, in the album booklet, the lyrics for &quot;Get Out!&quot; are still printed. Additionally, other unlicensed samples were removed from the songs &quot;We&#x27;re Only Gonna Die for Our Arrogance&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Get Stoned&quot;.

The reedited version was released as a picture disc limited edition vinyl album in 2002, following the sixth anniversary of the events of 1996. A limited edition vinyl was released through Hot Topic in 2010.

==Reception==

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album a mixed review, acknowledging its influence while also critiquing the band for attempting to include too many contradictory styles and influences at once, creating an incoherent sound, saying, &quot;The debut album from the SoCal trio is a flawed artifact of 1990s alt-rock, punk, ska, and hip-hop, but remains a fascinating document of Bradley Nowell as the honey-voiced musical tourist bro.&quot;

The author of the article also called the album &quot;prescient&quot; in foreshadowing the role hip-hop would have on late 1990s rock, adding that much of the influence of the album was the lifestyle captured in the lyrics, adding, &quot;the album resonated because it captured a lifestyle. Rejecting the smoldering angst of the grunge music that was beginning to take root on the radio, Sublime made revelry their primary muse, detailing parties, hookups, and bad decisions with such rowdy immediacy.&quot; The article also remarks that &quot;time hasn&#x27;t flattered&quot; the album due to the lyrical content concerning consent and treatment of women.

===Legacy===
Remembering the album on the 25th anniversary of its release, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;If &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; revels in its careening, narcotic whimsy, that&#x27;s partially why it&#x27;s stood the test of time. At its core, music is utilitarian, and Sublime reached a universality of experience that can&#x27;t become obsolete.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
Since its release in 1992, the album has proved to be a seller over time, moving over two million copies in the US alone and being certified Multi Platinum by the RIAA.

== Track listing ==
All tracks produced by Sublime and Elephant Levitation, except where noted. The songwriting attribution in the liner notes states &quot;all song by Sublime&quot; with the exception of the cover songs. Various sources, including Spotify and Tidal, credit blues guitarist B. B. King for the song &quot;What Happened&quot;; it appears that this is the result of confusion with his unrelated 1969 song of the same title. Track listing adapted from Tidal.

<doc id="195258" wikidata="Q437925" url="?curid=195258" title="Mick McCarthy">
<text>Michael Joseph McCarthy (born 7 February 1959) is a professional football manager, pundit and former footballer. He was most recently the head coach of Blackpool.

McCarthy began his playing career at Barnsley in 1977, and he later had spells at Manchester City, Celtic, Lyon, and finally Millwall, retiring in 1992. Born and raised in England, he represented the Republic of Ireland, for whom he earned 57 caps and played at UEFA Euro 1988 and the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

McCarthy managed Millwall and then the Republic of Ireland. He guided the country to the knockout stage of the last 16 of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He later managed Sunderland, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town. McCarthy began a second tenure as manager of the Republic of Ireland national team in November 2018, leaving after having guided the team to a UEFA Euro 2020 playoff place. He then had brief spells at Cypriot club APOEL, Cardiff City and Blackpool. He has also been a television pundit and commentator, including for the BBC and Virgin Media Television.

==Club career==
===Barnsley===
Born in Barnsley, Yorkshire, McCarthy made his league debut for then-Fourth Division Barnsley on 20 August 1977 in a 4–0 win over Rochdale. He spent two years in the basement league, before the club won promotion. Two years later, the team again went up to the (old) Division 2. A strong central defender, he was a virtual ever-present for his home town club, but departed in December 1983 for fellow Division 2 club Manchester City.

===Manchester City===
The Maine Road club won promotion in McCarthy&#x27;s first full season and he finally had the chance to play at the highest level. His first season in the top flight was steady enough as the club reached mid-table, but relegation struck the following year. McCarthy himself would not face the drop though as he moved to Celtic in May 1987.

===Celtic===
He picked up his first silverware at the Scottish club as they won the league and cup double in his first season. The following season McCarthy again won a Scottish Cup winners medal, although the club had to settle for third place in the league.

===Lyon===
McCarthy again moved onto a new country, as he joined Lyon on a three-year contract in July 1989. 

===Millwall===
McCarthy returned to England on loan with top-flight Millwall in March 1990. He signed permanently in May 1990 for £200,000. His appearances in the next two seasons were often limited by injuries and he effectively retired from playing when he took over as manager of the club in 1992.

==International career==
McCarthy, the son of an Irish-born father, Charlie, is an Irish citizen since birth. He made his Irish international debut in a goalless friendly against Poland on 23 May 1984, McCarthy soon became a first-choice player and featured in all three of Ireland&#x27;s games at UEFA Euro 1988. He went on to become captain, leading to the nickname &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot;, as per the title of his autobiography. 

The highlight of McCarthy&#x27;s international career was the second-round penalty shoot-out win over Romania in the 1990 World Cup finals. This led to a crunch tie with hosts Italy in the quarter-final, where Ireland&#x27;s first ever appearance in the finals came to an end, losing 1–0. McCarthy was the player who committed the most fouls in the 1990 tournament.

In total, McCarthy won 57 caps for the Republic of Ireland; scoring two goals, one against Yugoslavia in April 1988, the other against the United States in May 1992.

==Managerial career==
===Millwall===
McCarthy became player-manager at Millwall in March 1992, succeeding Bruce Rioch. In his first full season (1992–93), he was still registered as a player, but made only one further appearance (in the Anglo-Italian Cup), before he became solely a manager.

He took the club to the play-offs in 1993–94 after a strong third-place finish, but they lost out to Derby County in the semi-finals. During the 1995–96 season, McCarthy became the prime candidate for the vacant Republic of Ireland manager&#x27;s job, after the resignation of Jack Charlton. After a protracted period of speculation, McCarthy was officially appointed on 5 February 1996, two days after his resignation at the club. Despite sitting a comfortable 14 points clear from the relegation zone at the time of his departure, Millwall would go on to suffer the drop (by virtue of goals scored) after McCarthy&#x27;s departure.

His loan signings of the underachieving Russian internationals Sergei Yuran and Vassili Kulkov from Spartak Moscow, who each received a £150,000 signing-on fee and were being paid five times the wage of the rest of the first team, would later be cited as one of the main reasons Millwall were eventually relegated under Jimmy Nicholl, although it cannot be proven.

===Republic of Ireland===
In February 1996, McCarthy became the new manager of the Republic of Ireland football team following the resignation of Jack Charlton. His first game in charge was a friendly international against Russia on 27 March which finished in a 0–2 defeat.

After two narrow failures to qualify for the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, McCarthy took the nation to the 2002 World Cup held in South Korea and Japan after a 2–1 play-off aggregate win against Iran. Before the tournament, McCarthy was involved in a very public and bitter spat with star player Roy Keane, who was sent home the day before it began. The conflict occurred after Keane had questioned the quality of the preparations and facilities the team were using.

Despite this furore, McCarthy&#x27;s team reached the second round but were eliminated by Spain in a penalty shoot-out (after having already missed and scored a penalty in normal time). In spite of this, the Keane issue remained, with the proportion of blame undecided. Many in Ireland sided with Keane – particularly following a televised interview in which details of poor preparation were revealed – and demanded McCarthy&#x27;s resignation both during and after the tournament. An independent inquiry into the organisation&#x27;s handling of the squad&#x27;s preparation later commissioned by the Football Association of Ireland created a damning report, leading to general secretary Brendan Menton tendering his resignation.

Criticism of McCarthy in the media became increasingly intense after a poor start to Ireland&#x27;s qualifying campaign for Euro 2004. In particular, his persistence with several players and tactics that some perceived to be inadequate did him damage, as did a 4–2 away defeat to Russia and a 2–1 home defeat to Switzerland. Under mounting pressure, McCarthy resigned from the post on 5 November 2002. During his 68 games in charge, the Republic of Ireland won 29, drew 20 and lost 19.

===Sunderland===
On 12 March 2003, McCarthy was appointed manager of struggling Sunderland as an immediate replacement for Howard Wilkinson, who was sacked after six successive Premiership defeats left the club facing near-certain relegation. The following season, after relegation, he took Sunderland to the First Division promotion play-offs, but lost in a penalty shoot-out to Crystal Palace after Palace had scored a stoppage-time equaliser.

McCarthy completed the turnaround of the club in the 2004–05 season. The Black Cats returned to the Premier League as Football League Championship champions, amassing 94 points. After a poor season and with the club 16 points from safety with only 10 games remaining, he was dismissed on 6 March 2006.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===

On 21 July 2006, McCarthy was appointed manager at Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers, replacing Glenn Hoddle who had resigned a fortnight earlier. He signed a 12-month rolling contract The team managed to make the promotion play-offs in his first season, where they lost out to local rivals West Bromwich Albion over two legs, losing 3–2 at Molineux and 1–0 at The Hawthorns.

In the 2007–08 season he took the club to within a single placing of a successive play-off finish, ending seventh, losing the coveted sixth place to Watford by a goal difference of only one. The campaign had also seen him linked with the international positions of South Korea and his previous post as Republic of Ireland manager.

The 2008–09 season started well for McCarthy as he won the August Championship Manager of the Month Award, after seeing his side reach the top of the table, eventually going on to match Wolves&#x27; record start to a season (equaling the 1949–50 season). Wolves maintained their position at the top of the table over the following months, and McCarthy again won the Manager of the Month Award for November. After maintaining top spot since October, McCarthy&#x27;s Wolves secured promotion to the Premier League by beating QPR 1–0 on 18 April 2009. The following week McCarthy clinched his second Championship as a manager after a 1–1 draw at his hometown club Barnsley. He won the Championship Manager of the Season Award at the conclusion of the campaign, his side having led the table for 42 of 46 games.

The following season, McCarthy kept Wolves in the Premier League, his first success at this level in three attempts. The club assured safety with two games to spare, eventually finishing 15th, their best league finish since 1979–80, and their first ever survival in the modern Premier League. However, in the process of keeping the team in the top division, Wolves and McCarthy were fined £25,000 for fielding a weakened team for a fixture at Manchester United and thus breaking the Premier League rule E20. The Premier League also stated that the club had failed to fulfil its obligations to the league and other clubs in the utmost good faith and was therefore in breach of Rule B13.

The team spent the majority of the 2010–11 campaign mired in the relegation zone, yet managed to defeat the likes of Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea. A final day loss to Blackburn put them in danger of relegation, but results elsewhere meant they narrowly survived in 17th place, one point ahead of relegated Birmingham and Blackpool. This gave McCarthy the distinction of being the first Wolves manager in thirty years to maintain the club&#x27;s top flight position for two successive seasons.

The 2011–12 season began well for McCarthy and, after three games, his team topped the Premier League with 7 points. However, results tailed off and by January they had once again entered the relegation zone after nine games without victory. That same season Wolves sold £15 million worth of players and with the board allowing McCarthy to spend just £12 million it seemed inevitable when McCarthy was sacked as Wolves manager on 13 February 2012 after a run of poor results, culminating in a 5–1 home defeat to local rivals West Bromwich Albion.

===Ipswich Town===

On 1 November 2012, McCarthy was appointed manager at Championship side Ipswich Town on a two-and-a-half-year contract. McCarthy&#x27;s appointment came in the wake of Paul Jewell&#x27;s departure by mutual consent. McCarthy won his first match in charge as Ipswich manager on 3 November 2012, away at Birmingham, 0–1. This broke a 12 match winless run in the league, 13 matches in all competitions. McCarthy guided Ipswich past Burnley on 10 November – the first home win since March after a late DJ Campbell winner. The match ended 2–1. With a win against Nottingham Forest in late November, his sixth game in charge, McCarthy had successfully guided Ipswich out of the relegation zone. McCarthy&#x27;s Ipswich stopped Millwall&#x27;s 13-match unbeaten run with a 3–0 home win on 8 December. On 2 February 2013, McCarthy&#x27;s assistant Terry Connor took charge of a 4–0 rout of Middlesbrough while McCarthy was ill. McCarthy then guided Ipswich to safety, finally finishing in 14th place. Prior to the 2013–14 season, McCarthy had signed 10 new players. McCarthy&#x27;s first full season in charge of Ipswich ended with the club finishing in 9th place.

On 30 June 2014, McCarthy and Terry Connor agreed a new three-year deal with Ipswich. The following season he led the club to their first appearance in the Championship playoffs in ten years with a sixth-placed finish, before losing out to rivals Norwich City in the semi-finals. During the 2015–16 season McCarthy and assistant Terry Connor renewed their contracts for a further two seasons, with the option to extend until 2020. McCarthy led Ipswich to a 7th-place finish in his third full season at Portman Road. McCarthy&#x27;s fourth full season in charge ended in a 16th-place finish.

On 29 March 2018, Ipswich Town announced that McCarthy would be leaving the club at the end of the 2017–18 season on the expiry of his contract, along with assistant manager Terry Connor, after talks with owner Marcus Evans. His final season with the club was marred by a fractured relationship between him and the club&#x27;s supporters, with many supporters voicing their dissatisfaction with McCarthy&#x27;s defensive style of play and McCarthy branding them as &quot;numbskulls&quot;. He left the club earlier than expected on 10 April 2018, shortly after a 1–0 home win over Barnsley.

===Return to the Republic of Ireland===
On 25 November 2018, McCarthy was appointed manager of Republic of Ireland for the second time in his career, replacing Martin O&#x27;Neill. Robbie Keane, a legend for the national team, was appointed as one of McCarthy&#x27;s assistant coaches, alongside Terry Connor, who had previously assisted McCarthy at both Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town.

In March 2019, McCarthy won his first two games in charge, by defeating both Gibraltar and Georgia, in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers in Group D, by 1–0.
In June 2019, the national team drew 1–1 away to Denmark, before defeating Gibraltar once again, this time by 2–0, at the Aviva Stadium; four days later, McCarthy guided them to the top the Group D table, having taken ten points after four games.

On 5 September 2019, McCarthy&#x27;s side once again came from behind to draw 1–1 with Switzerland, which enabled them to remain at the top of their qualifying group, with three matches to play remaining. However, a 0–0 draw in Georgia, followed by defeat in Switzerland, left Ireland needing a win at home to Denmark to secure a top two spot. A 1–1 draw saw the Irish needing to win the play-offs to qualify. On 4 April 2020, amid the global coronavirus pandemic, McCarthy stood down as manager and was immediately replaced by Stephen Kenny, who had been in charge of the nation&#x27;s under-21s, for the play-offs.

===APOEL===
McCarthy joined Cypriot First Division club APOEL as manager on 2 November 2020; he signed a contract until 2022. He was sacked by the club on 5 January 2021 following a run of 2 wins, 1 draw and 5 defeats in his 8 games in charge.

===Cardiff City===
On 22 January 2021, McCarthy was appointed as manager of Cardiff City, following the sacking of Neil Harris. He signed a contract until the end of the season. His reign started with games against two of his former teams from his playing-days; Barnsley and Millwall – both of which ended as draws. His first win as Cardiff manager came in the following game, a 2–0 win against Bristol City. After making an unbeaten start to his reign at the club, a run that included a six-game winning streak, McCarthy signed a new two-year deal with the club on 4 March 2021. Cardiff finished the season in 8th place.

Despite losing just one of their opening six matches at the start of the following season, a poor run of results followed which saw Cardiff drop as low as 21st in the table. On 23 October 2021, after suffering a club-record eighth successive loss of the season at the hands of Middlesbrough, McCarthy left the club by mutual consent.

===Blackpool===
On 19 January 2023, McCarthy was appointed head coach of the Championship&#x27;s second-bottom placed club Blackpool on a short-term contract until the end of the season. On 8 April 2023, McCarthy left Blackpool by mutual consent, following a 3–1 home defeat to Cardiff the previous day. He achieved two wins in his 14 games in charge, losing nine of them, which left the club in 23rd. &quot;With results on the pitch not improving in recent weeks, the decision has been agreed by both parties that a change is needed,&quot; the club said in a statement.

==Personal life==
McCarthy&#x27;s brother-in-law is Robert Elstone, formerly Chief Executive of Everton.

<doc id="195259" wikidata="Q201346" url="?curid=195259" title="Marcion of Sinope">
<text>Marcion of Sinope (; ; ) was a theologian in early Christianity. Marcion preached that God had sent Jesus Christ, who was distinct from the &quot;vengeful&quot; God (Demiurge) who had created the world. He considered himself a follower of Paul the Apostle, whom he believed to have been the only true apostle of Jesus Christ; his doctrine is called Marcionism. Marcion published the earliest record of a canon of New Testament books.

Early Church writers such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian denounced Marcion as a heretic or antichrist, and he was excommunicated by the church of Rome around 144. He published his own canon of Christian sacred scriptures, which contained ten Pauline epistles (including the Epistle to the Laodiceans, while excluding the Pastoral epistles) and the Gospel of Marcion which historically is claimed to be an edited version of the Gospel of Luke. Some modern scholars, such as Matthias Klinghardt, have theorized that Marcion&#x27;s Gospel was the oldest, although this has been contested.

This made Marcionism a catalyst in the process of the development of the New Testament canon by forcing the proto-orthodox Church to respond to his canon.

==Life==

Epiphanius records in his (c. 375) that Marcion was born the son of a bishop in Pontus (modern-day Turkey), likely Philologus of Sinope. Rhodo and Tertullian, young men in Marcion&#x27;s old age, described him as a &quot;mariner&quot; and a &quot;ship-master&quot; respectively. Some time in the late 130s, Marcion traveled to Rome, joined the Roman church, and made a large donation of 200,000 sesterces to the congregation there. Conflicts with the church of Rome arose and he was eventually excommunicated in 144, his donation being returned to him.

Irenaeus writes that &quot;a certain Cerdo, originating from the Simonians, came to Rome under Hyginus [...] and taught that the one who was proclaimed as God by the Law and the Prophets is not the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (&quot;Against Heresies&quot;, 1, 27, 1). Also, according to them, Marcion and the Gnostic Valentinus were companions in Rome.

In 394, Epiphanius claimed that after beginnings as an ascetic, Marcion seduced a virgin and was accordingly excommunicated by his father, prompting him to leave his home town. Some scholars have taken this &quot;seduction of a virgin&quot; as a metaphor for Marcion&#x27;s corruption of the Christian Church, with the Church portrayed as the undefiled virgin, and that Marcion apparently has become &quot;the victim of the historicisation of such a metaphor, even though it contradicts the otherwise firm tradition of his strict sexual probity&quot;. Doubtful is Tertullian&#x27;s claim in &quot;The Prescription Against Heretics&quot; (written ) that Marcion professed repentance, and agreed to the conditions granted to him—that he should receive reconciliation if he restored to the Church those whom he had led astray—but that he was prevented from doing so by his death.

==Marcionite Church==

The Marcionite church expanded greatly within Marcion&#x27;s lifetime, becoming a major rival to the other emerging church. After his death, it retained its following and survived Christian controversy and imperial disapproval for several centuries. Several theologians have viewed him as a proto-protestant.

== Teachings ==

Study of the Hebrew Bible, along with received writings circulating in the nascent Church, led Marcion to conclude that many of the teachings of Jesus were incompatible with the actions of Yahweh, characterized as the belligerent god of the Hebrew Bible. Marcion responded by developing a ditheistic system of belief around the year 144. This notion of two gods—a higher transcendent one and a lower world-creator and ruler—allowed Marcion to reconcile his perceived contradictions between Christian Covenant theology and the gospel proclaimed by the New Testament.

In contrast to other leaders of the nascent Christian Church, however, Marcion declared that Christianity was in complete discontinuity with Judaism and entirely opposed to the scriptures of Judaism. Marcion did not claim that these were false. Instead, he asserted that they were entirely true, but were to be read in an absolutely literalistic manner, one which led him to develop an understanding that Yahweh was not the same God spoken of by Jesus. For example, Marcion argued that the Genesis account of Yahweh walking through the Garden of Eden asking where Adam was, proved that Yahweh inhabited a physical body and was without universal knowledge, attributes wholly incompatible with the Heavenly Father professed by Jesus.

According to Marcion, the god of the Old Testament, whom he called the Demiurge, the creator of the material universe, is a jealous tribal deity of the Jews, whose law represents legalistic reciprocal justice and who punishes mankind for its sins through suffering and death. In contrast, the God that Jesus professed is an altogether different being, a universal God of compassion and love who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy. Marcion also produced a book titled &quot;Antitheses&quot;, which is no longer extant, contrasting the Demiurge of the Old Testament with the Heavenly Father of the New Testament.

Marcion held Jesus to be the son of the Heavenly Father but understood the incarnation in a docetic manner, i.e. that Jesus&#x27; body was only an imitation of a material body, and consequently denied Jesus&#x27; physical and bodily birth, death, and resurrection.

Marcion was the first to codify a Christian canon. His canon consisted of only eleven books, grouped into two sections: the , a shorter version of the Gospel of Luke, and the , a selection of ten epistles of Paul the Apostle, which were also slightly shorter than the canonical text. Early Christians such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Epiphanius claimed that Marcion&#x27;s editions of Luke and the Pauline epistles were intentionally edited by Marcion to match his theological views, and many modern scholars agree. However, some scholars argue that Marcion&#x27;s texts were not substantially edited by him, and may in some respects represent an earlier version of these texts than the canonical versions. Like the Gospel of Mark, the gospel used by Marcion did not contain elements relating to his birth and childhood. Interestingly, it did contain some Jewish elements, and material that challenged Marcion&#x27;s ditheism—a fact that was exploited by early Christians in their polemics against Marcion.

The centrality of the Pauline epistles in Marcion&#x27;s canon reflects the fact that Marcion considered Paul to be the correct interpreter and transmitter of Jesus&#x27; teachings, in contrast to the Twelve Disciples and the early Jerusalem church. In Marcion&#x27;s view, the other apostles were under the auspices of the Demiurge.

==Gnosticism==
Marcion is sometimes described as a Gnostic philosopher. In some essential respects, Marcion proposed ideas which aligned well with Gnostic thought. Like the Gnostics, he believed that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit who appeared to human beings in human form, but did not actually take on a fleshly human body.

However, Marcionism conceptualizes God in a way which cannot be reconciled with broader Gnostic thought. For Gnostics, some human beings are born with a small piece of God&#x27;s soul lodged within their spirit (akin to the notion of a Divine Spark). God is thus intimately connected to and part of his creation. Salvation lies in turning away from the physical world (which Gnostics regard as an illusion) and embracing the godlike qualities within oneself. Marcion, by contrast, held that the Heavenly Father (the father of Jesus Christ) was an utterly alien God; he had no part in making the world, nor any connection with it. According to Bart Ehrman: &quot;Marcion himself should not be thought of as a Gnostic; he held that there were only two gods, not many; he did not think of this world as a cosmic disaster, but as the creation of the Old Testament God; and he did not think divine sparks resided in human bodies that could be set free by understanding the true &#x27;gnosis.&#x27; Moreover, his docetic view does not appear to have been the typical view of Gnostics.&quot;

<text>The isabelline wheatear (Oenanthe isabellina) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher in the family Muscicapidae. It is a migratory insectivorous bird. Its habitat is steppe and open countryside and it breeds in southern Russia and Central Asia to northern Pakistan, wintering in Africa and northwestern India. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe.

In colouring it resembles a female northern wheatear but it is larger at in length, more upright and more tawny in colour, and has more black on its tail. The term &quot;isabelline&quot; refers to the parchment-like colouration. The axillaries and underwing coverts are white, whereas in the commoner bird they are mottled with grey. The sexes are similar.

==Etymology==
The name is from the specific &quot;isabellinus&quot;, Neo-Latin for &quot;greyish-yellow&quot;, and is likely in reference to Isabella I of Castile, who is said to have promised not to change her undergarments until Spain was freed from the Moors. &quot;Wheatear&quot; is not derived from &quot;wheat&quot; or any sense of &quot;ear&quot;, but is a 16th-century linguistic corruption of &quot;white&quot; and &quot;arse&quot;, referring to the prominent white rump found in most species. The genus name &quot;Oenanthe&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;oenos&quot; (οίνος) &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; (ανθός) &quot;flower&quot;. It refers to the northern wheatear&#x27;s return to Greece in the spring just as the grapevines blossom.

==Description==
Male and female isabelline wheatear are similar in appearance. The upper-parts are a pale sandy brown with an isabelline tinge (isabelline is a pale grey-yellow, fawn, cream-brown or parchment colour). The lower back is isabelline and the rump and upper tail-coverts are white. The tail feathers are brownish-black with a narrow edge and tip of buff and a large white base. In the outer tail feathers this occupies more than half the length of the feather but in the central feathers it is about one third. There is an over-eye streak of creamy white and the ear-coverts are pale brown. The chin is pale cream and the throat pale buff. The breast is sandy or isabelline buff and the belly creamy white. The under tail-coverts are pale buff and the under wing-coverts and axilliaries white with dark bases. The wing feathers are brownish-black, tipped and edged with creamy buff. The beak, legs and feet are black and the irises are brown.

At a length of it is rather larger and also paler in colour than the northern wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;). The beak is longer than that bird and the ear-coverts are paler but otherwise the birds are very similar in appearance and could be confused. The plumage is moulted twice a year, there being a complete moult in late summer and a partial moult of the body feathers in mid-winter.

The call note is a chirp, and a loud whistle is sometimes emitted. The song has been described as lark-like and starts with a croaking noise followed by various whistles and includes mimicry of the voices of other birds.

==Distribution and habitat==
The isabelline wheatear is a migratory species with an eastern palearctic breeding range. This extends from Southern Russia, the Caspian region, the Kyzyl Kum Desert and Mongolia to Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Israel. It winters in Africa and northwestern India. It has occurred as a summer vagrant to Greece, Cyprus, Algeria and Tunisia.

In the breeding season the isabelline wheatear is found in open country, barren tracts of land, arid regions, steppes, high plateaux and on the lower slopes of hills. In its winter quarters it occupies similar habitats in semi-arid regions, open country with sparse scrub and the borders of cultivated areas, showing a particular liking for sandy ground.

==Behaviour==

The isabelline wheatear is an active and restless bird, moving across the ground with long hops, flitting into the air and perching on eminences or small bushes. Its posture is rather upright and it is constantly bobbing about and flaring, raising and lowering its tail. It sometimes flutters into the air to catch insect prey but mostly forages along the ground, probing the soil with its beak. Its diet includes ants, grasshoppers, moths, flies, mites, spiders and insect larvae, and it sometimes eats seeds as well.

Isabelline wheatears are solitary birds in their winter quarters and may associate with other &quot;Oenanthe&quot; species during migration. On arrival at their breeding grounds they establish territories. The male isabelline wheatear displays to the female by drooping and then spreading his wings while singing, leaping a short distance in the air, or flying up fifteen metres (fifty feet) or so, hovering and performing stunts, singing all the while, before landing again beside the female. The nest is usually underground, normally in the empty burrow of a pika, ground squirrel or mole rat, or they may excavate a fresh burrow. The nest is bulky and is composed of dried grasses. Four to six pale blue eggs are laid, usually unmarked but sometimes with a scattering of reddish speckles. The average size of the eggs is . Both parents feed the chicks with small caterpillars and other insects. After they leave the nest, the chicks continue to be fed for about two weeks but after this the parents drive them out of the territory. The breeding season starts at the end of March in Turkey but does not commence until May in Central Asia. There are probably two broods in the southern parts of the range.

==Status==
The isabelline wheatear has an extensive range, estimated as being 11.7 million square kilometres (4.36 million square miles), and a large population with an estimated total of 26 million to 378 million individuals. The population seems to be stable and the IUCN in their Red List of Threatened Species has evaluated this species as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>The desert wheatear (Oenanthe deserti) is a wheatear, a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher (Muscicapidae). It is a migratory insectivorous species, in length. Both western and eastern forms of the desert wheatear are rare vagrants to western Europe. The western desert wheatear breeds in the Sahara and the northern Arabian Peninsula. The eastern race is found in the semi-deserts of Central Asia and in winter in Pakistan and northeast Africa.

The plumage of the upper parts of the male in summer is buff. The underparts are white with a buff tinge on the breast. The black on the face and throat extends to the shoulders, and there is distinct white superciliary stripe. The female is greyer above and buffer below and has no black on the throat, and in the winter plumage the black on the throat of the male is partially obscured by the white tips of the feathers. A distinguishing characteristic, in both sexes of all ages, is that the entire tail is black to the level of the upper tail-coverts.

The desert wheatear feeds largely on insects which it picks up off the ground. It breeds in the spring when a clutch of usually four pale blue, slightly speckled eggs is laid in a well-concealed nest made of grasses, mosses and stems.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The genus name &quot;Oenanthe&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;oenos&quot; (οίνος) &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; (ανθός) &quot;flower&quot;. It refers to the northern wheatear&#x27;s return to Greece in the spring just as the grapevines blossom. The specific &quot;deserti&quot; is Latin for &quot;desert&quot;. &quot;Wheatear&quot; is not derived from &quot;wheat&quot; or any sense of &quot;ear&quot;, but is a 16th-century linguistic corruption of &quot;white&quot; and &quot;arse&quot;, referring to the prominent white rump found in many species.

Four subspecies are recognised; &quot;Oenanthe deserti deserti&quot; is found in the Levant; &quot;Oenanthe deserti atrogularis&quot; is found in Transcaucasia, Iran, Afghanistan and Mongolia; &quot;Oenanthe deserti homochroa&quot; is found from Western Sahara to the west part of Egypt; &quot;Oenanthe deserti oreophila&quot; is found in West China, Kashmir, Tibet, and Pakistan and north eastern Africa.

==Description==
The head and nape of the adult male desert wheatear are a pale sandy-grey colour with the feathers tipped grey. The mantle, scapulars and back are a similar but rather richer colour. The rump and upper tail-coverts are pale buff. The basal third of the tail feathers are white and the rest black with a pale buff tip. A curved stripe over the eye is pale buff and extends backwards. The feathers of the chin, throat, lores and ear-coverts are black tipped with white. The breast and flanks are sandy-buff and the belly and under tail-coverts are creamy-white tinged with buff. The axillaries and under wing-coverts are black tipped with white. The primaries have black outer webs, tipped and edged with white and inner webs pale brown edged with white. The secondaries are similar but have broader white edges to both webs. Its length is about and it weighs between .
The female has similar plumage but the rump and upper tail-coverts are more sandy brown, the lores, chin and throat pale buff and the dark parts of the tail brownish-black. The juvenile is similar to the adult female but the feathers on the upper parts of the body have pale centres and brown tips which gives the bird a more speckled appearance. There is a single annual moult in late summer and by the following spring the feathers have become rather abraded, with the white tips tending to be worn away, leaving the bird with rather richer colouring. The beak, legs and feet are black and the irises of the eyes dark brown.

==Distribution and habitat==
The eastern race of the desert wheatear breeds in a great swathe of Asia extending from the Middle East and Saudi Arabia through Iran, Baluchistan, Afghanistan, the south Caucasus, Turkestan, the Tarbagatai Mountains, the Altai Mountains and north western Mongolia. Birds from this region migrate southwards to overwinter in northeastern Africa, the Arabian peninsula, Iraq and Pakistan. The western race breeds in North Africa from Morocco and Rio de Oro to the part of Egypt west of the River Nile. This population is largely resident but in Morocco, birds in the south and east part migrate while those in the south west tend not to.

The habitat of the desert wheatear is barren open countryside, steppes, deserts, semi-arid plains, saltpans, dried up river beds and sandy, stony and rocky wasteland. It is found at altitudes of up to . During the winter it may also visit cultivated land when this is interspersed with bare areas of countryside.

The desert wheatear is an occasional vagrant to the United Kingdom, and a female got blown off course in October 2012 during its autumn migration and was seen in a sandpit in Essex. Only a few weeks later, another was seen in the RSPB Loch of Strathbeg reserve in Scotland.

==Behaviour==
The desert wheatear tends to perch on a bush, tussock or grass or other eminence and dart to the ground beneath to pounce on insects and other small invertebrates, though it can also catch insects in the air. The diet usually consists of ants, beetles, caterpillars and flies and the larvae of various insects including ant-lions. In addition to these, seeds have also been found in its stomach. It is able to hover for short periods and when it finds a large prey insect, with which it is unable to cope, it sometimes displays in front of it by fluttering its wings.

The desert wheatear breeds during late April or May over most of its range. It nests on rocky hillsides, on steppes, on sandy plains, in crevices in walls or in hollows under rocks. The nest is often concealed behind gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;) bushes or other bushy vegetation and is a tidily-built cup made of grasses, mosses and stems, lined with fine roots and hairs, and sometimes small feathers. A clutch of four (occasionally five) eggs are laid. These are pale bluish with fine rusty speckles, usually forming a distinct zone at the wider end. They measure approximately . Incubation is done mainly by the female and both sexes help care for the young.

==Status==
The desert wheatear has a very large range breeding range, estimated as nearly 10 million square kilometers (3.9 million square miles), and the population appears to be stable. For this reason, the bird is listed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<text>The western black-eared wheatear (Oenanthe hispanica) is a wheatear, a small migratory passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now considered to be an Old World flycatcher (family Muscicapidae). It was formerly (and still is by some authorities) considered conspecific with the eastern black-eared wheatear.

The breeding male has the forehead and crown white or nearly white, the mantle buff, and the wings blacker than those of the northern wheatear. The underparts are white tinged with buff. The back, upper tail coverts and most of the tail are white. A black mask extends from the ear coverts to the bill. The throat can be either black or white.

In autumn and winter the head and mantle are distinctly buff, as are the underparts (including the throat in non-black-throated individuals), but the buff varies in intensity. Except for the central pair, the tail feathers are much whiter than in the northern wheatear, the white on the inner web often extending to the tip.

The female is a browner bird, but has the characteristic white lower back, and her seasonal changes are less marked.

The male western black-eared wheatear can be distinguished from the male eastern black-eared wheatear by its more buff-tinged upperparts, giving it a less distinctly black-and-white appearance than the latter species, as well as having the black of the mask stopping at the base of the bill rather than extending slightly above. Black-throated individuals of this species have less black on the throat and face than on the eastern birds, and the black generally terminates less abruptly. Females of this species differ from their eastern counterparts in being warmer brown overall.

==Taxonomy==

In 1743 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the western black-eared wheatear in his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Red or Russet-colour’d Wheat-Ear&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen owned by Mark Catesby that had been collected in Gibraltar. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the western black-eared wheatear with the wagtails in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla hispanica&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The specific epithet is from the Latin &quot;Hispanicus&quot; meaning &quot;Spanish&quot;. The western black-eared wheatear is now placed in the genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The western black-eared wheatear was formerly considered to be conspecific with the eastern black-eared wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe melanoleuca&quot;). The species were split based on the results of a genetic study of the wheatears published in 2019.

The genus name &quot;Oenanthe&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;oenos&quot; (οίνος) &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; (ανθός) &quot;flower&quot;. It refers to the northern wheatear&#x27;s return to Greece in the spring just as the grapevines blossom. The specific &quot;hispanica&quot; is Latin for &quot;Spanish&quot;. &quot;Wheatear&quot; is not derived from &quot;wheat&quot; or any sense of &quot;ear&quot;, but is a 16th-century linguistic corruption of &quot;white&quot; and &quot;arse&quot;, referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.

<text>Sinop, historically known as Sinope (, ), is a city on the isthmus of İnce Burun (İnceburun, Cape Ince) and on the Boztepe Peninsula, near Cape Sinope (Sinop Burnu, Boztepe Cape, Boztepe Burnu) which is situated on the northernmost edge of the Turkish side of the Black Sea coast, in the ancient region of Paphlagonia, in modern-day northern Turkey. It is the seat of Sinop Province and Sinop District. Its population is 57,404 (2022).

==History==
Over a period of approximately 2,500 years, Sinope has at various times been settled by Colchians and then the Greeks (in the late 7th, late 5th, and 4th–3rd centuries BC) and by Turkic people beginning in the 13th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries it was also settled by the &quot;muhacir&quot; who immigrated from the Balkans and Caucasus.

The Greek colony of Sinope () was founded by Ionians from the city of Miletus. Sinope issued its own coinage, founded colonies, and gave its name to a red earth pigment called sinopia, which was mined in Cappadocia for use throughout the ancient world. Some scholars have dated the earliest Greek colonization of Sinope to the 7th c. BC, while others have proposed an earlier date in the 8th c. While literary evidence exists supporting earlier settlement, archaeological evidence has been found of Greek settlement around the Black Sea region beginning in the late 7th century.

Sinope was strategically located among the trade routes that were developing on the southern Coast of the Black Sea, but remained relatively isolated from other inland communities until the 4th century BC. There is literary evidence of early links between Colchis and Sinope in mythological tradition. Strabo″s writings link the legendary founder of Sinope, Autolycus, with Jason and the Argonauts. Polybius described Sinope as being &quot;on the way to Phasis&quot;. The Persian Achaemenid Empire″s northward expansion in the 4th century disrupted Sinope&#x27;s control over its eastern colonies, including Trapezus (present day Trabzon). The satrap Datames briefly occupied the city around 375 BC. There is archaeological evidence of increased economic activity between the port city of Sinope and the surrounding inland areas during between 4th and 1st c. BC. Sinope appears to have maintained its independence from the dominion of Alexander the Great, and with the help of Rhodes turned back an assault led by Mithridates II of Pontus in 220 BC. Sinope eventually fell to Pharnaces I in 183 BC, after which it became the capital of the Pontic Kingdom.
The Roman general Lucullus conquered Sinope in 70 BC, and Julius Caesar established a Roman colony there, Colonia Julia Felix, in 47 BC. Mithradates Eupator was born and buried at Sinope, and it was the birthplace of Diogenes, of Diphilus, poet and actor of the New Attic comedy, of the historian Baton, and of the Christian heretic of the 2nd century AD, Marcion.

After the division of the Roman Empire in 395, Sinope remained with the Eastern Roman Empire. Its history in the early Byzantine period is obscure, except for isolated events: it was used by Justinian II as a base from which to reconnoitre Cherson, participated in the rebellion of the Armeniac Theme in 793, was the site of Theophobos&#x27; proclamation as emperor by his Khurramite troops in 838, and suffered its only attack by the Arabs in 858.

In 1081, the city was captured by the Seljuk Turks, who found there a sizeable treasury, but Sinope was soon recovered by Alexios I Komnenos, ushering a period of prosperity under the Komnenian dynasty. After the sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, it was captured for the Empire of Trebizond by David Komnenos, until the Seljuk Turks of Rûm successfully captured the city in 1214. The city returned briefly to Trapezuntine rule in 1254, but returned to Turkish control in 1265, where it has remained since.

After 1265, Sinop became home to two successive independent emirates following the fall of the Seljuks: the Pervâne and the Jandarids. During his march on Trebizond, the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II overawed Ismail, the emir of Sinop, and forced him to surrender the city without a fight. Mehmet took possession in late June 1461, exiling Ismail to Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv) in northern Thrace.

Ibn Battuta visited the city and stayed for about forty days. He noted it was &quot;a superb city which combines fortification with beautification.&quot;

In 1614, Sinop was targeted by Cossack raiders and extensively looted and burned in an event which shocked Ottoman contemporaries.

In November 1853, at the start of the Crimean War, in the Battle of Sinop, the Russians, under the command of Admiral Nakhimov, destroyed an Ottoman frigate squadron in Sinop, leading Britain and France to declare war on Russia.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Sinop was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.

As of 1920, Sinop was described as populated mainly by Greeks with an approximate population of 8,000. It was also considered the &quot;safest&quot; port &quot;between Bosphorus and Batum&quot;, at the time. During this period, the port was exporting wheat, tobacco, seeds, timber and hides. They imported produce, coal and hardware. The Greek inhabitants left in 1923 after the Population Exchange between Greece and Turkey, with many settling in Nea Sinopi.

Sinop hosted a US military base and radar that was important for intelligence during the Cold War era. The US base was closed in 1992.

Explorer Robert Ballard discovered an ancient ship wreck north west of Sinop in the Black Sea and was shown on National Geographic.

==Numismatics==

Greek coins featuring an eagle holding a dolphin or marine animal in its talons have been found in Sinope, Istria and Olbia. Located in present-day Turkey, Romania and Ukraine respectively, all three were colonies of Miletus. The coins circulated between c. 450 and 325 BC. Coins of the &quot;Sinope type&quot; continued to be issued by Persians under Achaemenid rule in the 4th century BC. At least two Persian issuers of such coins have been studied in some detail: the satrap Datames in Cappadocia and Ariarathes.

==Economy==
As of 1920, Sinop was producing embroidered cotton cloth. They also were known for boatbuilding. The boats produced in Sinop were described by a British observer as being of &quot;primitive design but sound workmanship.&quot;

Sinop was slated to be the site of the Sinop Nuclear Power Plant, a $15.8 billion nuclear power plant to be developed by Elektrik Üretim, Engie, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Itochu. The plant would consist of four reactors, with construction to begin in 2017 and completion by 2028. The project was cancelled in 2018.
