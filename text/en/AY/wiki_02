<text>Shelley Winters (born Shirley Schrift; August 18, 1920 – January 14, 2006) was an American film actress whose career spanned seven decades. She won Academy Awards for &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959) and &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; (1965), and received nominations for &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), the latter of which also earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role - Motion Picture. She also appeared in &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955), &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962), &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966), &quot;Next Stop, Greenwich Village&quot; (1976), and &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; (1977). She also acted on television, including a tenure on the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;, and wrote three autobiographies.

==Early life==
Shelley Winters was born Shirley Schrift in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of Rose (née Winter), a singer with St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre (&quot;The Muny&quot;), and Jonas Schrift, a designer of men&#x27;s clothing. Her parents were Jewish; her father migrated from Grymalow, Galicia, Austria-Hungary, in what is now Ukraine, and her mother was born in St. Louis to Austrian immigrants who were also from Grymalow. Her parents were third cousins. Her Jewish education included attendance at the Jamaica Jewish Center and learning Hebrew songs at her public school. Her family moved to Brooklyn, New York, when she was nine years old, and she grew up partly in Queens, New York, as well. As a young woman, she worked as a model. Her sister Blanche Schrift later married George Boroff, who ran the Circle Theatre (now named El Centro Theatre) in Los Angeles, California. At age 16, Winters relocated to Los Angeles, and later returned to New York to study acting at The New School.

==Career==
===1940–1946: Broadway debut and early films ===

Winters made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; (1941) which had a short run. She had a small part in &quot;Rosalinda&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (1942–44) which ran for 611 performances. Winters first received acclaim when she joined the cast of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; as Ado Annie.

She received a long-term contract at Columbia and moved to Los Angeles. Winters&#x27; first film appearance was an uncredited bit in &quot;There&#x27;s Something About a Soldier&quot; (1943) at Columbia. She had another small bit in &quot;What a Woman!&quot; (1943) but a bigger part in a B movie, &quot;Sailor&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1944). Winters was borrowed by the Producers Releasing Corporation for &quot;Knickerbocker Holiday&quot; (1944). Columbia put her in small bits in &quot;She&#x27;s a Soldier Too&quot; (1944), &quot;Dancing in Manhattan&quot; (1944), &quot;Together Again&quot; (1944), &quot;Tonight and Every Night&quot; (1945), &quot;Escape in the Fog&quot; (1945), &quot;A Thousand and One Nights&quot; (1945), and &quot;The Fighting Guardsman&quot; (1946). Winters had bit parts in MGM&#x27;s &quot;Two Smart People&quot; (1946), and a series of films for United Artists: &quot;Susie Steps Out&quot; (1946), &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot; (1946) and &quot;New Orleans&quot; (1947). She had bit parts in &quot;Living in a Big Way&quot; (1947) and &quot;Killer McCoy&quot; (1947) at MGM, &quot;The Gangster&quot; (1947) for King Brothers Productions and &quot;Red River&quot; (1948). She played Brenda Martingale in Siodmak&#x27;s &quot;Cry of the City&quot; (1948).

===1947–1954: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

Winters first achieved stardom with her breakout performance as the victim of insane actor Ronald Colman in George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947). It was distributed by Universal which signed Winters to a long-term contract. She had a supporting role in &quot;Larceny&quot; (1948) then 20th Century Fox borrowed her for &quot;Cry of the City&quot; (1948). Winters was second-billed in &quot;Johnny Stool Pigeon&quot; (1949) with Howard Duff, and &quot;Take One False Step&quot; (1949) with William Powell. Paramount borrowed her to play Myrtle in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1949) with Alan Ladd. Back at Universal she was in &quot;Winchester 73&quot; (1950), opposite James Stewart, a huge hit. Universal gave Winters top billing in &quot;South Sea Sinner&quot; (1950). She co-starred with Joel McCrea in &quot;Frenchie&quot; (1950).

Winters originally broke into Hollywood films as a blonde bombshell type, but quickly tired of the role&#x27;s limitations. She claims to have washed off her make-up to audition for the role of Alice Tripp, the factory girl, in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, directed by George Stevens, now a landmark American film. As the Associated Press reported, the general public was unaware of how serious a craftswoman Winters was. &quot;Although she was in demand as a character actress, Winters continued to study her craft. She attended Charles Laughton&#x27;s Shakespeare classes and worked at the Actors Studio, both as student and teacher.&quot; She studied in the Hollywood Studio Club, and in the late 1940s, she shared an apartment with Marilyn Monroe. Her performance in &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; (1951), a departure from the sexpot image that her studio, Universal Pictures, was grooming her for at the time, brought Winters her first acclaim, earning her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Winters went to United Artists for &quot;He Ran All the Way&quot; (1951) with John Garfield and RKO for &quot;Behave Yourself!&quot; (1951) with Farley Granger. Winters was top-billed in &quot;The Raging Tide&quot; (1951) at Universal. She was loaned to 20th Century Fox for &quot;Phone Call from a Stranger&quot; (1952), with Bette Davis.

At Universal she did &quot;Meet Danny Wilson&quot; (1952) with Frank Sinatra and &quot;Untamed Frontier&quot; (1952) with Joseph Cotten. She went to MGM for &quot;My Man and I&quot; (1952) with Ricardo Montalbán. She performed in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; on stage in Los Angeles. Winters took off some time for the birth of her first child in 1953. She made her TV debut in &quot;Mantrap&quot; for &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot; in 1954. At MGM, she did &quot;Executive Suite&quot; (1954) and &quot;Tennessee Champ&quot; (1954), top-billed in the latter. Winters returned to Universal to appear in &quot;Saskatchewan&quot; (1954), shot on location in Canada with Alan Ladd and &quot;Playgirl&quot; (1954) with Barry Sullivan. She appeared in a TV version of &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;.

Winters travelled to Europe to make &quot;Mambo&quot; (1954) with Vittorio Gassman who became her husband. She then shot &quot;Cash on Delivery&quot; (1954) in England. Winters performed in a version of &quot;The Women&quot; for &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; then had a key role in &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (1955) starring opposite Julie Harris and Laurence Harvey. Even more highly acclaimed was Charles Laughton&#x27;s 1955 &quot;Night of the Hunter&quot; with Robert Mitchum and Lillian Gish. At Warner Bros, Winters was Jack Palance&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;I Died a Thousand Times&quot; (1955), then for RKO she co starred with Rory Calhoun in &quot;The Treasure of Pancho Villa&quot; (1955). She was in &quot;The Big Knife&quot; (1955) for Robert Aldrich.

=== 1955–1969: Establishment ===

Winters returned to Broadway in &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;, in 1955–1956, opposite Ben Gazzara and future husband Anthony Franciosa. It ran for 398 performances. &quot;Girls of Summer&quot; (1956–57) was directed by Jack Garfein and co-starred George Peppard but only ran for 56 performances. On TV she reprised her &quot;Double Life&quot; performance in &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot; in 1957. She appeared in episodes of &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot;, and &quot;Kraft Theatre&quot;.

In 1960, she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Mrs. Van Daan in George Stevens&#x27; film adaptation of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1959). She donated her award statuette to the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. Winters was in much demand as a character actor now, getting good roles in &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow&quot; (1959), &quot;Let No Man Write My Epitaph&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Young Savages&quot; (1961). She received excellent reviews for her performance as the man-hungry Charlotte Haze in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962).

Winters returned to Broadway on &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1962), playing Bette Davis&#x27;s role. She performed Off Broadway in &quot;Cages&quot; by Lewis John Carlino in 1963. Many of her roles now had a sexual component: in &quot;The Chapman Report&quot; (1962) she played an unfaithful housewife and she played madams in &quot;The Balcony&quot; (1963) and &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot; (1964). She appeared in &quot;Wives and Lovers&quot; (1963) and episodes of shows such as &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, and &quot;Thirty-Minute Theatre&quot;. Winters was featured in the Italian film &quot;Time of Indifference&quot; (1964) with Rod Steiger and Claudia Cardinale, and had one of the many cameos in the religious epic &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), again for George Stevens.

Winters won her second Best Supporting Actress Oscar in &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot; (1965) for her performance as Rose-Ann D&#x27;Arcey, the cruel and vulgar mother of an illiterate, blind girl. She had supporting roles opposite Michael Caine in &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966) and as the fading, alcoholic former starlet Fay Estabrook in &quot;Harper&quot; (1966). She returned to Broadway in &quot;Under the Weather&quot; (1966) by Saul Bellow which ran for 12 performances. Winters played &quot;Ma Parker&quot; the villain in &quot;Batman&quot;. She was in a TV version of &quot;The Three Sisters&quot; (1966) and had roles in &quot;Enter Laughing&quot; (1967) for Carl Reiner, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;, &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; (several episodes), &quot;The Scalphunters&quot; (1968) for Sydney Pollack, &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot; (1968), &quot;Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell&quot; (1968), &quot;Arthur? Arthur!&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Mad Room&quot; (1969).

=== 1970–1999: Later roles ===

Winters played Ma Barker in &quot;Bloody Mama&quot; (1970) a big hit for Roger Corman. She had roles in &quot;How Do I Love Thee?&quot; (1970) and &quot;Flap&quot; (1970) for Carol Reed. She returned to the stage to play Minnie Marx, mother of the Marx Brothers in the Broadway musical &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Boys&quot; (1970), which ran for 80 performances. Winters wrote an evening of three one-act plays titled &quot;One Night Stands of a Noisy Passenger&quot; (1970–1971), which ran for seven performances; the cast included Robert De Niro and Diane Ladd. Winters had the lead in two horror films, &quot;Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?&quot; (1971), and &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Helen?&quot; (1971), and two TV movies, &quot;Revenge!&quot; (1971), and &quot;A Death of Innocence&quot; (1971). She had supporting roles in &quot;Adventures of Nick Carter&quot; (1972) and had a coleading role in &quot;Something to Hide&quot; (1972) with Peter Finch. She starred in &quot;The Vamp&quot; for &quot;ITV Sunday Night Theatre&quot;. In &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972), she was the ill-fated Belle Rosen (for which she received her final Oscar nomination). She put on weight for the role and never got rid of it.

Winters was top-billed in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1973) for TV. She had a supporting role in &quot;Blume in Love&quot; (1973) for Paul Mazursky and &quot;Cleopatra Jones&quot; (1973) and leading parts in &quot;Big Rose: Double Trouble&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Sex Symbol&quot; (1974).

She starred in a 1978 Broadway production of Paul Zindel&#x27;s &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;, which only had a short run. Winters starred in the Italian horror film &quot;Gran bollito&quot; (1977) and played Gladys Presley in &quot;Elvis&quot; (1979) for TV. She was in &quot;The Visitor&quot; (1979), &quot;City on Fire&quot; (1979), &quot;The Magician of Lublin&quot; (1979) for Menahem Golan, &quot;The French Atlantic Affair&quot; (1979) and an episode of the ABC series &quot;Vega$&quot;, with Vega$ star Robert Urich . In 1980, Winters published the best-selling autobiography &quot;Shelley: Also Known As Shirley&quot; She followed it up in 1989 with a second memoir, &quot;Shelley II: The Middle of My Century&quot;.

Winters&#x27; 1980s performances included &quot;Looping&quot; (1981), &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, episodes of &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Sex, Lies and Renaissance&quot; (1983), &quot;Over the Brooklyn Bridge&quot; (1984), &quot;Ellie&quot; (1984), &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (1985), &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Delta Force&quot; (1986).

She was in &quot;Very Close Quarters&quot; (1986), &quot;Purple People Eater&quot; (1988), and &quot;An Unremarkable Life&quot; (1989).

Her final performances included &quot;Touch of a Stranger&quot; (1990), &quot;Stepping Out&quot; (1991) with Liza Minnelli, &quot;Weep No More, My Lady&quot; (1992), &quot;The Pickle&quot; (1993) for Mazursky, and &quot;The Silence of the Hams&quot; (1994). Later audiences knew her primarily for her autobiographies and for her television work, in which she usually played a humorous parody of her public persona. In a recurring role in the 1990s, Winters played the title character&#x27;s grandmother on the sitcom &quot;Roseanne&quot;. Her final film roles were supporting ones: She played a restaurant owner and mother of an overweight cook in &quot;Heavy&quot; (1995) with Liv Tyler and Debbie Harry for James Mangold; an aristocrat in &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), starring Nicole Kidman and John Malkovich; and an embittered nursing home administrator in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Gideon&quot;. She was in comedies such as &quot;Backfire!&quot; (1995), &quot;Jury Duty&quot; (1995), and &quot;Mrs. Munck&quot; (1995) as well as &quot;Raging Angels&quot; (1995). Winters made an appearance at the 1998 Academy Awards telecast, which featured a tribute to Oscar winners past and present.

The Associated Press reported: &quot;During her 50 years as a widely known personality, Winters was rarely out of the news. Her stormy marriages, her romances with famous stars, her forays into politics and feminist causes kept her name before the public. She delighted in giving provocative interviews and seemed to have an opinion on everything.&quot; That led to a second career as a writer. Though not a conventional beauty, she claimed that her acting, wit, and chutzpah gave her a sex life to rival Monroe&#x27;s. Her claimed partners included William Holden, Sean Connery, Burt Lancaster, Errol Flynn, and Marlon Brando.

==Personal life==
Winters was married four times. Her husbands were:
*Captain Mack Paul Mayer, whom she married on December 29, 1943, in Brooklyn. Winters and Mayer were divorced in October 1948. Mayer was unable to deal with Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood lifestyle&quot; and wanted a &quot;traditional homemaker&quot; for a wife. Mayer wore his wedding ring up until her death, and kept their relationship very private.
*Vittorio Gassman, whom she married on April 28, 1952, in Juárez, Mexico; they divorced on June 2, 1954. They had one child: Vittoria, born February 14, 1953, a physician who practices internal medicine at Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Connecticut. She was Winters&#x27; only child. 
*Anthony Franciosa, whom she married on May 4, 1957; they divorced on November 18, 1960.
*Gerry DeFord, whom she married on January 13, 2006.

Hours before her death, Winters married long-time companion Gerry DeFord, with whom she had lived for 19 years. Though Winters&#x27; daughter objected to the marriage, the actress Sally Kirkland performed the wedding ceremony for the two at Winters&#x27; deathbed. Kirkland, a minister of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, also performed Winters&#x27;s non-denominational last rites.

Winters had a much-publicized romance with Farley Granger that became a long-term friendship (according to their respective autobiographies). She starred with him in the 1951 film &quot;Behave Yourself!&quot; as well as in a 1957 television production of A. J. Cronin&#x27;s novel &quot;Beyond This Place&quot;.

Winters was a Democrat and attended the 1960 Democratic National Convention. In 1965, she addressed the Selma Marchers briefly outside Montgomery, Alabama on the night before they marched into the state capitol. Winters endorsed Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1968 and Michael Dukakis&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1988.

Winters became friendly with rock singer Janis Joplin shortly before Joplin died in 1970. She invited Joplin to sit in on a class session at the Actors&#x27; Studio at its Los Angeles location. Joplin never did.

==Death==
Winters died at the age of 85 on January 14, 2006, of heart failure at the Rehabilitation Center of Beverly Hills; she had suffered a heart attack on October 14, 2005. She is interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<doc id="187095" wikidata="Q2316133" url="?curid=187095" title="The Blue Veil (1951 film)">
<text>The Blue Veil is a 1951 American historical drama film directed by Curtis Bernhardt and starring Jane Wyman, Charles Laughton and Joan Blondell. It tells the story of a woman who spends her life caring for other people’s children, beginning just after World War I. The title refers to the headdresses once worn by governesses and nannies, colored blue to distinguish them from the white veils worn by medical nurses. The screenplay by Norman Corwin is based on a story by François Campaux, adapted for the French-language film &quot;Le Voile Bleu&quot; in 1942.

==Plot==
Following the death of her newborn baby, war widow LouLou Mason accepts a temporary two-week assignment as nursemaid to the infant son of corset manufacturer Frederick K. Begley, who lost his wife in childbirth. She ingratiates herself with the family and eventually becomes a permanent fixture. When she declines Frederick&#x27;s proposal, he marries his secretary Alicia Torgersen, who fires LouLou following her honeymoon.

LouLou finds employment with wealthy Henry and Fleur Palfrey and begins to care for baby Robbie. Older son Harrison is expelled from boarding school due to poor grades and bad behavior and returns home with his tutor, Jerry Kean. When Jerry is offered a job in Beirut, he impulsively proposes to LouLou, who accepts. While waiting for his fiancée to pack, Jerry speaks to Fleur, who warns him about marrying a woman he barely knows. Having second thoughts, he suggests he and LouLou wait a few months before marrying, and she remains with the Palfreys.

Years pass, and LouLou is nursemaid to Stephanie, the twelve-year-old daughter of fading musical actress Annie Rawlins. When Annie is delayed at an audition and misses Stephanie&#x27;s confirmation, the girl tells her friends that LouLou is her mother. Realizing the girl has become too attached to her, Loulou decides to find work elsewhere.

Just prior to the start of World War II, LouLou accepts a job with Helen and Hugh Williams. Hugh joins the military and is injured in battle, prompting his wife to join him in England. Two years pass, and the widowed Helen, who still has not returned home, stops sending money to support her son Tony. LouLou accepts responsibility for the boy and raises him as her own. Years later, when Helen notifies her that she is returning with her new husband, LouLou flees to Florida with Tony, but is arrested and charged with kidnapping. Although he is sympathetic to LouLou&#x27;s situation, the district attorney is compelled by law to return Tony to Helen.

Now too old to be entrusted with the care of a baby, LouLou accepts a janitorial job in an elementary school in order to be close to children. When she visits an ophthalmologist, she discovers he is Robbie Palfrey, the now adult son of her former employers. Robbie invites her to his home for dinner the following week and arranges for all the children for whom she cared to be there with their spouses. As LouLou catches up with her former charges, Robbie announces he wants her to be the nanny for his own children.

==Cast==
==Critical reception==
Bosley Crowther of the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a whoppingly banal tear-jerker [that] will lure multitudes of moviegoers who like nothing better than a good cry.&quot; He added, &quot;Mr. Corwin&#x27;s scenario, under Curtis Bernhardt&#x27;s soupy direction, stretches Miss Wyman&#x27;s situation...into a series of parchedly sunlit episodes, contrived to squeeze the heart and present this lady as a quivering-lipped saint. There is little in the way of wit, grit or, for that matter, real substance...Miss Wyman..has little to do herself except to age daintily. She exercises reasonable restraint but persevering sweetness with an iron halo in a grating two-hour gamut. And since Miss Wyman, like the rest of &quot;The Blue Veil&quot;, is so far removed from flesh and blood, we can only leave her and it to heaven.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; noted &quot;Curtis Bernhardt&#x27;s direction handles the drama surely, if at times a bit measured, and never strives for dramatic tricks beyond the level of the simple, warm story being told.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
==Box office==
The film earned $2.2 million in rentals in the U.S. and Canada during 1951 and total rentals of $3,550,000, making a profit of $450,000.

In May 1952 it was reported the film had returned net earnings to Wald and Krasna of $800,000.

==Radio adaptation==
&quot;The Blue Veil&quot; was presented on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; November 24, 1952. The one-hour adaptation starred Wyman in her screen role.

<doc id="187098" wikidata="Q253308" url="?curid=187098" title="Shirley Booth">
<text>Shirley Booth (born Marjory Ford; August 30, 1898October 16, 1992) was an American actress. One of 24 performers to achieve the Triple Crown of Acting, Booth was the recipient of an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards and three Tony Awards.

Primarily a theater actress, Booth began her career on Broadway in 1915. Her most significant success was as Lola Delaney, in the drama &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, for which she received her second Tony Award in 1950 (she would go on to win three). She made her film debut, reprising her role in the 1952 film version, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her performance. Despite her successful entry into films, she preferred acting on the stage, and made only four more films.

From 1961 to 1966, she played the title role in the sitcom &quot;Hazel&quot;, for which she won two Primetime Emmy Awards. She was acclaimed for her performance in the 1966 television production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. Her final role was providing the voice of Mrs. Claus in the 1974 animated Christmas television special &quot;The Year Without a Santa Claus&quot;.

==Early life==
Booth was born Marjory Ford in New York City, according to her birth certificate to Albert James and Virginia M. (née Wright) Ford. In the 1900 New York state census, she was listed as Thelma Booth Ford. She had one sibling, a younger sister, Jean. Her early childhood was spent in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where she attended Public School 152.

When she was age 7, Booth&#x27;s family moved to Philadelphia, where she first became interested in acting after seeing a stage performance. When Booth was a teenager, her family moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where she became involved in summer stock. She made her stage debut in a production of &quot;Mother Carey&#x27;s Chickens&quot;. Against her father&#x27;s protests, she dropped out of school and traveled to New York City to pursue a career. She initially used the name Thelma Booth when her father forbade her to use the family name professionally. She eventually changed her name to Shirley Booth.

==Career==
Booth began her stage career as a teenager, acting in stock company productions. She was a prominent actress in Pittsburgh theatre for a time, performing with the Sharp Company. Her debut on Broadway was in the play &quot;Hell&#x27;s Bells&quot;, with Humphrey Bogart, on January 26, 1925. Booth first attracted major notice as the female lead in the comedy hit &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot;, which ran from 1935 to 1937. During the 1930s and 1940s, she achieved popularity in dramas, comedies and later musicals. She acted with Katharine Hepburn in &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1939), originated the role of Ruth Sherwood in the 1940 Broadway production of &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, and performed with Ralph Bellamy in &quot;Tomorrow the World&quot; (1943).
Booth also starred on the popular radio series &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, playing the lighthearted, wisecracking, man-crazy daughter of the unseen tavern owner on CBS radio from 1941 to 1942 and on NBC Blue from 1942 to 1943. Her then-husband, Ed Gardner, created and wrote the show as well as played its lead character Archie, the manager of the tavern; Booth left the show after the couple divorced. She auditioned unsuccessfully for the title role of &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; in 1948; she had been recommended by Harry Ackerman, who was to produce the show, but Ackerman told radio historian Gerald Nachman that he felt Booth was too conscious of a high school teacher&#x27;s struggles to have full fun with the character&#x27;s comic possibilities. &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; became a radio and television hit when the title role went to Eve Arden. In the summer of 1949, Booth portrayed Phyllis Hogan in the situation comedy &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; on NBC radio.

Booth received her first Tony Award, for Best Supporting or Featured Actress (Dramatic), for her performance as Grace Woods in &quot;Goodbye, My Fancy&quot; (1948). Her second Tony was for Best Actress in a Play, which she received for her widely acclaimed performance as the tortured wife Lola Delaney in the poignant drama &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; (1950). Sidney Blackmer received the Tony for Best Actor in a Play for his performance as her husband Doc.

Her success in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; was followed by the musical &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1951), based on the popular novel, in which she played the feisty, but lovable Aunt Sissy, which proved to be another major hit. Her popularity was such that, at the time, the story was skewed from the original so that Aunt Sissy was the leading role (rather than Francie). Booth then went to Hollywood and reprised her stage role in the 1952 film version of &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; with Burt Lancaster playing Doc. After that movie was completed — her first of only five films in her career — she returned to New York and played Leona Samish in Arthur Laurents&#x27; play &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot; (1952) on Broadway.

Booth received the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, becoming the first actress ever to win both a Tony and an Oscar for the same role. The film also earned Booth Best Actress awards from The Cannes Film Festival, the Golden Globe Awards, the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, and National Board of Review. She received her third Tony, her second in the Best Actress in a Play category, for her performance in &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot;.

Booth was age 54 when she made her first movie, but she had successfully shaved almost a decade off her real age, with her publicity stating 1907 as the year of her birth. Her correct year of birth was known by only her closest associates, until her correct year of birth, 1898, was announced at the time of her death. Her second starring film, &quot;About Mrs. Leslie&quot;, a romantic drama opposite Robert Ryan, was released in 1954 to good reviews, but was poorly received by audiences. In 1953, Booth had made a cameo appearance as herself in the all-star comedy/drama movie &quot;Main Street to Broadway&quot;. She spent the next few years commuting between New York and California. On Broadway, she scored personal successes in the musical &quot;By the Beautiful Sea&quot; (1954) and the comedy &quot;Desk Set&quot; (1955). Although Booth had become well known to moviegoers during this period, the movie roles for &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot; (re-titled as &quot;Summertime&quot; for the film in 1955), and &quot;Desk Set&quot; (1957), both went to Katharine Hepburn.

In 1957, Booth won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work on the stage in Chicago. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1959, starring as the long-suffering title character in Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s musical &quot;Juno&quot;, an adaptation of Seán O&#x27;Casey&#x27;s 1924 play &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;. In 1961, director Frank Capra approached Booth about starring in &quot;Pocketful of Miracles&quot;, an updated version of Capra&#x27;s 1933 comedy-drama &quot;Lady for a Day&quot; starring May Robson. Booth informed him that she was unable to match Robson&#x27;s Oscar-nominated performance in the original film and declined the role. Capra instead cast Bette Davis, who was unfavorably compared to Robson by most reviewers when the film was released.

Booth starred in two more films for Paramount Pictures, playing Dolly Gallagher Levi in the 1958 film adaptation of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s romance/comedy &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; (the source text for the musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;), and to play Alma Duval in the drama &quot;Hot Spell&quot; (1958). For her performances in both films, Booth was nominated as the year&#x27;s Best Actress by the New York Film Critics Circle).

===&quot;Hazel&quot;===
In 1961, Booth was cast in the title role on the sitcom &quot;Hazel&quot;, based on Ted Key&#x27;s popular single-panel cartoon from the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; about the domineering yet endearing housemaid named Hazel Burke who works for the Baxter family. The series also starred Don DeFore as George Baxter, Whitney Blake as Dorothy &quot;Missy&quot; Baxter, and Bobby Buntrock as the Baxters&#x27; young son Harold. Upon its premiere, &quot;Hazel&quot; was an immediate hit with audiences and drew high ratings.

In 1963, Booth told the Associated Press at the height of &quot;Hazel&quot;&#x27;s popularity,

I liked playing Hazel the first time I read one of the scripts, and I could see all the possibilities of the character—the comedy would take care of itself. My job was to give her heart. Hazel never bores me. Besides, she&#x27;s my insurance policy.

Over the course of its five-year run, Booth won two Primetime Emmy Awards for her work in the series and was nominated for a third. Booth is one of the few performers to win all three major entertainment awards (Oscar, Tony, Emmy).

In 1965, NBC canceled the series. CBS picked up and retooled the series; Don DeFore (George Baxter) and Whitney Blake (Dorothy Baxter) were written out of the series, while Bobby Buntrock (Harold &quot;Sport&quot; Baxter) remained a cast member. Ray Fulmer was cast as Steve Baxter, the brother of DeFore&#x27;s character George. Booth, who owned the rights to the series, hired Lynn Borden, a former Miss Arizona, as Steve&#x27;s wife Barbara. Julia Benjamin was cast as Barbara and Steve&#x27;s daughter Susie. In the retooled version, George and Dorothy Baxter have moved to Baghdad, leaving Harold to live with Steve and Barbara. Hazel remains on as the new Baxters&#x27; housekeeper. While ratings for the fifth season were still strong (&quot;Hazel&quot; ranked number 26 for the season), Booth decided to end the show due to health problems.

===Later career and retirement===
Shortly after the end of &quot;Hazel&quot;, Booth appeared in the television production of &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; that aired on the anthology series &quot;CBS Playhouse&quot;. She won critical acclaim for her performance and was nominated for another Primetime Emmy Award.

Booth&#x27;s final Broadway appearances were in a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Hay Fever&quot; and the musical &quot;Look to the Lilies&quot;, both in 1970. In 1971, she returned to Chicago to star with Gig Young in a revival of &quot;Harvey&quot; at the Blackstone Theater. In 1973, Booth returned to episodic television in the ABC series &quot;A Touch of Grace&quot;. The series was based on the British sitcom &quot;For the Love of Ada&quot;. &quot;A Touch of Grace&quot; was canceled after one season.

In 1974, Booth provided the voice for the character of Mrs. Claus in the animated television special &quot;The Year Without a Santa Claus&quot;. It was Booth&#x27;s final acting role after which she retired to her home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

==Personal life==
On November 23, 1929, Booth married Ed Gardner, who later gained fame as the creator and host of the radio series &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, with Booth originating the role of man-hungry Miss Duffy in the series. They divorced in 1942. She married William H. Baker Jr., a corporal in the U.S. Army, the following year. Booth and Baker remained married until his death from heart disease in 1951. She never remarried and had no children from either marriage.

For her contributions to the film industry, Booth has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard.

After retiring from acting in 1974, Booth moved to North Chatham, Massachusetts, where she lived with her pet poodle and two cats. She maintained contact with her friends via telephone and spent her time painting and doing needlework. In November 1979, she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. Booth did not attend the ceremony, and the award was accepted on her behalf by Celeste Holm.

==Death==
By 1976, Booth&#x27;s health began to decline. She reportedly suffered a stroke that caused mobility issues and blindness. After her death, Booth&#x27;s sister said she had broken her hip in 1979, which restricted her mobility. On October 16, 1992, 
Booth died at the age of 94 at her home in North Chatham. After a private memorial service, Booth was interred in the Baker family plot in Mount Hebron Cemetery in Montclair, New Jersey.

<doc id="187100" wikidata="Q1737875" url="?curid=187100" title="Come Back, Little Sheba (1952 film)">
<text>Come Back, Little Sheba is a 1952 American drama film directed by Daniel Mann in his directorial debut and produced by Paramount Pictures. The script was adapted by Ketti Frings from the 1950 play of the same title by William Inge. Starring Burt Lancaster, Shirley Booth, Terry Moore, and Richard Jaeckel, the film tells the story of a marriage between a recovering alcoholic and his frumpy wife, which is rocked when a young college student rents a room in the couple&#x27;s house. The title refers to the wife&#x27;s little dog that disappeared months before the story begins and whom she still openly grieves for. Booth, who had originated her role on Broadway and was making her film debut, won Best Actress honors at the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes, and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards.

==Plot==
Doc Delaney is a recovering alcoholic married to Lola, a frumpy, middle-aged housewife. Doc had once been a promising medical student, but dropped out of college when Lola became pregnant with his child, marrying her because her father had thrown her out of the house. The child later died, and Lola was unable to have any more children. Doc spent the years drinking away the pain, in the process ruining his career and wasting his inheritance. Doc, now sober for one year, is polite but distant toward his wife, while a lonely and unhappy Lola sleeps late, dresses sloppily, and does not keep a tidy house. Every day she goes outside to call for her lost dog Little Sheba, whom she dreams about.

To make some money, Lola rents a room to Marie, a college student brimming with youthfulness and sexuality. One day Marie brings home Turk, a star on the track team, to model for an ad she is creating for a local athletic competition. Turk is wearing his track outfit which shows off his physique. Lola encourages the couple in their modeling session, but Doc, who walks in to find Turk under-dressed, thinks it borders on pornography. Doc disapproves of a hustler like Turk taking advantage of a virtuous young girl like Marie, but Lola defends him, pointing out that Marie is engaged to another young man, Bruce, who is away but due to return soon.

As Marie&#x27;s infatuation with Turk grows, Doc becomes agitated. Lola reminds him that Marie is much like she had been in her younger days, before she became &quot;old, fat, and sloppy&quot;. Doc calms down, but still voices his disapproval of Marie seeing another boy while Bruce is away. One night, Turk and Marie return from having a few beers, with Turk having every intention of spending the night. Doc sees them together and, deeply upset, goes to the kitchen and looks at his bottle hidden in the cupboard. When Turk tries to force himself on Marie, she asks him to leave. His departure is unseen by Doc, who comes back to see the light go off under Marie&#x27;s door.

The next morning Doc takes the whiskey he has not touched for a year from the cabinet and disappears for hours, missing the elaborate dinner Lola has planned for Marie and Bruce. Lola sets the table with the fine china she received from Doc&#x27;s mother when they married, cleans up the living room, and changes into a fancy dress. Early the next morning, Doc returns in a drunken rage, lashing out at Lola that she is as much a slut as Marie and threatening her with a knife. Lola manages to call two of Doc&#x27;s Alcoholics Anonymous friends to take him to the hospital. Doc chases Lola into the kitchen and tries to choke her, then passes out. The two men arrive and take Doc away. Lola goes to the hospital where Doc is being treated and spends the night with him.

The next day, a shaken Lola returns home and calls her parents asking to stay with them while Doc is gone, but her father still refuses to welcome her back. Her mother offers to come stay with Lola, but Lola turns her down. Marie sends her a telegram saying that she and Bruce have married. A few days later, Doc returns from the hospital, apologizes to Lola for his behavior, and begs her never to leave him, vowing to be more attentive to her. Lola promises to stay with him forever; he is all she has. As the two begin to rekindle their marriage, Doc notices how Lola has renovated the kitchen and she tells him how she has found closure in Sheba&#x27;s death.

==Production==
===Development===
The film is based on the Broadway play &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; by William Inge, produced by the Theatre Guild. Paramount Pictures purchased the rights to the play for $100,000 plus a percentage of the film&#x27;s profits.

This was Daniel Mann&#x27;s film directorial debut. Producer Hal Wallis urged him to direct the film since he had directed the play on Broadway. Ketti Frings wrote the adaptation. Several scenes which did not appear in the play were added for the film version, notably the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

===Casting===

Shirley Booth, who originated the role of Lola in the Broadway production and won a Tony Award for her performance, reprised the role in her screen debut. When it appeared that Booth might have other commitments, producer Wallis asked Bette Davis to take the role, but she declined. Booth told a &quot;Life&quot; magazine interviewer in 1952 that she had developed the character of Lola from observing several women on the streets of New York City, &quot;including an unkempt woman she had seen walking aimlessly one night on Sixth Avenue with a dirty white poodle&quot;.

Burt Lancaster lobbied for the part of the middle-aged Doc though he was only 38 years old at the time. Wallis recalled in his autobiography that &quot;in order to make the trim and muscular Lancaster appear older, his baggy, shapeless costume was padded at the waist and he was instructed to stoop, hollow his chest and shuffle his feet&quot;. Wallis said in an interview that studio executives were &quot;[p]repared to accept glamorous men and women in melodramas of the seamy side of life, [but] they were shocked at the thought of making a picture with beaten, unkempt, depressing people&quot;. Film critic John C. Tibbetts conjectures that that stance was behind the casting of Lancaster, who was a virile young star. Tibbetts adds: &quot;It was Lancaster&#x27;s idea to transform the weakling Doc into a strong man debilitated by his wife over a period of years&quot;.

===Filming===
Production took place from mid February to late March 1952. Location filming was held near the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles.

==Release==
Paramount pre-released the film in New York City and Los Angeles during Christmas week of 1952 in order to qualify for the Academy Award nominations for that year. The official release date was March 1953.

As a result, the film collected several awards before the official release date. The National Board of Review awarded Shirley Booth its Best Actress honor, having viewed the film in a screening room at Paramount Pictures. Booth was also named Best Actress at the 10th Golden Globe Awards and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, and was singled out for honors in an Associated Press poll of newspaper critics, a &quot;Film Daily&quot; poll, and &quot;Look&quot; magazine, before the March release date. The &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; noted in its review that the local theater delayed screening the picture until after the awards season, in order to take advantage of the resultant publicity.

==Box office==
The film earned $3.5 million in box-office receipts. It was the thirteenth biggest money-maker of 1953.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Newsweek&quot; called the film &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s few outstanding movies of the year&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine labeled it &quot;a minor, but moving tragedy on a major theme: the lives of quiet desperation that men lead&quot;. The &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; noted the frankness of the script, in which the lead characters openly discuss the reason for their hasty marriage and the college students are seen as &quot;sex-happy&quot;. This review recommended the film &quot;as &#x27;must&#x27; entertainment to the discriminating adult moviegoer&quot;. &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; said the film was an example of &quot;intelligent movie-making when Hollywood forgets mass appeal and makes a story because it is a good story or a good play. It is poignant and powerful and more than a picture, rather an experience that proves to be deeply moving&quot;. However, this review felt Mann&#x27;s direction was &quot;uneven&quot;, with the scenes between Doc and Lola coming across as more natural and convincing than those between Marie and Turk. It speculates that &quot;possibly he [Mann] just gave Miss Booth her head and let her go, since she had done the role so many times on the stage&quot;.
Shirley Booth&#x27;s screen debut won unanimous critical praise. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Enough cannot be said for the excellence of the performance Miss Booth gives in this, her first screen appearance—which, in itself, is something of a surprise. Her skillful and knowing creation of a depressingly common type—the immature, mawkish, lazy housewife—is visualization at its best&quot;.

The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; asserted that Booth&#x27;s &quot;is the kind of a performance that strikes a match to the screen, and endows the profession of acting with a towering dignity. … [She] gives Doc&#x27;s wife heartbreak and compassion, and encloses the part in a choking pathos. … Miss Booth is the real force behind the overwhelming tug and the blistering realism of &#x27;Come Back, Little Sheba&#x27;&quot;.

The &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; wrote that Booth &quot;is the picture&quot;. It praised the &quot;subtlety and depth&quot; that Booth invests in her performance, making her character &quot;both funny and tragic. Her ceaseless, child-like prattle almost drives the viewers mad, but her radiant love of people wins them back to her&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Shirley Booth has the remarkable gift of never appearing to be acting&quot;. Film critic John C. McCarten agreed with that sentiment, writing: &quot;Her portrait of a loving, not too bright lady driving a sensitive man to drink looks so authentic it is unsettling&quot;. Writing in 1992, film critic James Monaco said: &quot;Booth&#x27;s brilliant work (she originated the role on Broadway) remains etched forever in the memory of anyone who has seen the film&quot;.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called Burt Lancaster&#x27;s performance a &quot;complete switch from anything he has ever done and easily the outstanding effort of his career&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; said Lancaster &quot;brought an unsuspected talent to his role as a middle-aged, alcoholic husband&quot;, a sentiment echoed by the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;: &quot;As for Mr. Lancaster, he taps a talent Hollywood has never heretofore explored, and brilliantly underlines the saddeningly frustrated Doc&quot;. Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the excellence of Mr. Lancaster as the frustrated, inarticulate spouse, weak-willed and sweetly passive, should not be overlooked&quot;. &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; asserted that &quot;Lancaster is definitely miscast. His youth and vitality show through his makeup. He&#x27;s far from believable, especially in the early portions of the film&quot;.

According to Monaco, this was Terry Moore&#x27;s &quot;finest performance&quot;. Crowther adds: &quot;As the pretty and hot-blooded boarder, Terry Moore strikes precisely the right note of timeless and endless animalism and Richard Jaeckel is good as the boy who carnally pursues her&quot;. Critics also praised Philip Ober&#x27;s role as an Alcoholics Anonymous leader, and the A.A. meeting scene itself, which the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; described as &quot;quite touching and revealingly illustrated&quot; and which Crowther called &quot;one of the nicer bits of Americana in the film&quot;.

Sociologist Norman K. Denzin writes that &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot; was the first Hollywood production to depict an A.A. meeting along with organizational practices such as sponsors, 12-step calls to fellow alcoholics, slogans, and &quot;birthday&quot; parties celebrating years of sobriety. Unlike other reviewers who focused on the performances of the lead actors in what is obviously a dead marriage, Denzin believes that &quot;the film&#x27;s implicit thesis [is] that alcoholism is a family disease&quot;. He explains:
Their readings treated the film as being about something else, that something else being Inge&#x27;s picture of broken dreams in middle-class family life in small town America. In this reading they missed Inge&#x27;s other major point, namely, that when dreams are broken for the middle class, alcoholism is not far behind. …
The film&#x27;s negative feminization of Lola (her slovenly appearance, etc.) carries forward the loss of femininity theme in the female alcoholism films examined in the last chapter. She takes on the visual characteristics of a female alcoholic, even though she never drinks.
In a sense the movie is about her and her acceptance of her husband&#x27;s alcoholism. More deeply, it is about her acceptance of her lost child, her lost relationship with her father, and Doc&#x27;s lost medical degree. Little Sheba represents her past and a past that she will not let go of. It is necessary, then, to read the film, not as a study of an alcoholic personality, but as a study of an alcoholic marriage. The film is about the past and how the past shapes and destroys the present.

==Accolades==
==Other versions==
A television version of the original play was made in 1977, starring Laurence Olivier, Joanne Woodward and Carrie Fisher. It was directed by Silvio Narizzano.

The play was integrated into a sketch on &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;, starring Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Burt Lancaster.

<doc id="187101" wikidata="Q5932254" url="?curid=187101" title="Demographic profile">
<text>A demographic profile is a form of demographic analysis in which information is gathered about a group to better understand the group&#x27;s composition or behaviors for the purpose of providing more relevant services.

In business, a demographic profile is usually used to increase marketing efficiency. This is done by using gathered data to determine how to advertise products or services to specific audiences and identify gaps in marketing strategy. By focusing on a specific audience, a company can more efficiently spend advertising resources to maximize sales. This tactic is more direct than simply advertising on the basis that everyone is a potential consumer; while this may be true, it does not capitalize on the increased returns that more focused marketing can generate.

Traditional demographic profiling involves gathering information on large groups of people in order to identify common trends, such as changes in population size or composition over time. These trends can be identified by analyzing data gained through surveys, censuses, in-store purchase information, records, registries, and so on. Analysis of this information may promote change in services for a population subset, such as children, the elderly, or working-age people. Newer methods of collecting and using information for demographic profiling include target-sampling, quota-sampling, and door-to-door screening.

A comprehensive demographic profile is a powerful tool for marketing. Detailed information about potential customers provides insight into how to best sell them a product. The term &quot;demographic profiling&quot; is sometimes used as a euphemism for industrial espionage.

== Methods ==
Historically, a census has been the most important tool when it comes to tracking demographic data such as population, births, deaths, and relationship status. The United States census was first introduced in 1790 and has been taken every 10 years since under constitutional law. While the questions in the US Census vary each decade, its aim is to quantifiable measure characteristics about the residents within its borders, such as marital status, age, sex, race, education status, employment status, and location. Even though the US Census is the most relied-on tool for collecting this information, it still has its flaws, such as overcount and undercount, which have caused controversy in previous years.

Metadata provides a modern method of constructing demographic profiles. Certain types of digital metadata are generated by a user&#x27;s online behavior—such as which websites are frequently visited, the amount of time spent on each website, the website interactions or purchase history, and which other users were interacted with—and serve as a digital footprint. Metadata collection is so pervasive that businesses record most aspects of a user&#x27;s online activity. Companies such as Google and Facebook make enormous profits through generating and processing metadata, which can then be used for targeted advertising. This process impacts the user&#x27;s online experience, such as curating which ads are displayed or which websites are suggested.

== Controversy ==
Metadata collection has proven to be a controversial topic, with concerns expressed over how and why detailed personal information is saved and used by businesses. To avoid future legislation limiting metadata collection, companies must act ethically and have people&#x27;s privacy in mind when they target people for advertising.

An example of how this could become an issue is presented by Ewing et al. (2013), who proposed the idea of a virtual reality shopping programme. Within this programme, the shopper is greeted by a virtual attendant who knows them by name and suggests an array of suitable clothing options based on their past purchases. The shopper is delighted by the seamless nature of this shopping experience. However, when they try to pay with their credit card, the virtual attendee reveals an unreasonably detailed knowledge about the shopper&#x27;s financial situation, such as their credit score, payment history, and financial responsibility. This example highlights the need for discretion in the extent to which information is gathered, and how it is applied.

<doc id="187102" wikidata="Q452267" url="?curid=187102" title="Aldrich Ames">
<text>Aldrich Hazen Ames (; born May 26, 1941) is an American former CIA counterintelligence officer who was convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union and Russia in 1994. He is serving a life sentence, without the possibility of parole, in the Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana. Ames was known to have compromised more highly classified CIA assets than any other officer until Robert Hanssen, who was arrested seven years later in 2001.

==Early life and education==

Ames was born in River Falls, Wisconsin, on May 26, 1941, to Carleton Cecil Ames and Rachel Ames (&quot;&quot; Aldrich). His father was a college lecturer at the Wisconsin State College-River Falls, and his mother a high school English teacher. Aldrich was the eldest of three children and the only son. In 1952, his father began working with the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s Directorate of Operations in Langley, Virginia. The following year, in 1953, his father was posted to Southeast Asia for three years, and the family relocated there. Carleton received a &quot;particularly negative performance appraisal&quot; in part because of serious alcoholism, and spent the remainder of his career at CIA headquarters in Langley.

Ames attended McLean High School in McLean, Virginia. Beginning in 1957, following his sophomore year, he worked for the CIA for three summers as a low-ranking GS-3 records analyst as part of a program to give temporary jobs to children of CIA employees. Ames was responsible for marking classified documents for filing as well as making fake money to be used in training programs for &quot;the Farm&quot;, where CIA trainees began. Two years later, in 1959, Ames entered the University of Chicago, where he planned to study foreign cultures and history. His &quot;long-time passion&quot; for drama, however, resulted in failing grades, and he did not finish his sophomore year.

==CIA career==
Ames returned to the CIA during the summer of 1960 as a laborer and painter. He then became an assistant technical director at a Chicago theater until February 1962. Returning to the Washington metropolitan area, Ames took full-time employment at the CIA doing the same sort of clerical jobs he had performed in high school. While taking his first polygraph examination, Ames claimed to have committed a crime, which was considered no probability of deception. When asked to elaborate on the offense, Ames confessed that he and a friend not affiliated with CIA, while drunk, stole a delivery boy&#x27;s bicycle and went joyriding. However, this confession had not been considered grave enough to disqualify Ames from a security clearance.

Five years after beginning his work for the CIA, Ames completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C.. He did not plan to have a career with the agency, but after attaining the grade of GS-7 and receiving good performance appraisals, he was accepted into the Career Trainee Program despite several alcohol-related brushes with the police. In 1969, Ames married a fellow CIA officer, Nancy Segebarth, whom he had met in the Career Trainee Program.

Ames was assigned to Ankara, Turkey, and Nancy then resigned from the CIA because of a rule that prohibited married partners from working from the same office. Ames&#x27; job in Turkey was to target Soviet intelligence officers for recruitment. He succeeded in infiltrating the communist Dev-Genç organization through a roommate of student activist Deniz Gezmiş and a beauty pageant contestant whose boyfriend was participating in a movement to overthrow the Turkish government. In spite of this success, Ames&#x27; performance was rated only &quot;satisfactory&quot;. His superiors considered the spies recruited to be of sufficient value, but a remark was made that Ames was &quot;unsuited for field work and it is recommended he spend the remainder of his career at CIA headquarters&quot;. Discouraged by the critical assessment, Ames considered resigning from the agency.

In 1972, Ames returned to CIA headquarters, where he spent the next four years in the Soviet-East European (SE) Division, where he was responsible for managing assets and his skills were better utilized. His performance reviews were &quot;generally enthusiastic&quot;. Nevertheless, his excessive drinking was noted, and two &quot;eyes only&quot; memoranda were placed in his file.

In 1976, Ames was assigned to New York City, where he handled two important Soviet assets. His performance was rated excellent, and he received several promotions and bonuses, being ranked above most operations officers in his pay grade. However, Ames&#x27; tendency to procrastinate in submissions of financial accounting was noted. His inattention to detail also led him to commit two security violations, including once leaving a briefcase containing classified operational materials on the New York City Subway, which the FBI recovered and determined as being uncompromised. Ames later said he received a verbal reprimand but no documentation of the matter.

In 1981, Ames accepted a posting to Mexico City while his then-wife remained in New York City. His evaluations in Mexico were mediocre at best, and he engaged in at least three extramarital affairs. In October 1982, Ames began an affair with , a cultural attaché in the Colombian embassy and a CIA informant. He married her in 1985, and fathered a son with her, Paul Ames, who was born in 1989. Despite CIA regulations, Ames had not reported his relationship with a foreign national to his superiors, even though some of his colleagues were aware of it. His lackluster performance reviews were again partly the result of his heavy drinking. At a diplomatic reception in Mexico City, Ames got into a loud, drunken argument with a Cuban official that &quot;caused alarm&quot; among his superiors.

In September 1983, Ames was transferred back to the Southeast Asia division at CIA headquarters. His reassignment placed him &quot;in the most sensitive element&quot; of the Department of Operations, which was responsible for Soviet counterintelligence. Ames had access to all CIA plans and operations against the KGB and the GRU, Soviet military intelligence. In October, he formally separated from Nancy; in November, he submitted an &quot;outside activity&quot; report to the CIA, noting his romantic relationship with Rosario. Aldrich Ames later remarked that Nancy made little fuss about the affair and quickly agreed to a divorce, but made it well known she was keeping most of their joint assets.

As part of his divorce settlement from his first wife, Ames agreed to pay the debts that they had accrued and provide Nancy monthly support for three and a half years, totaling approximately $46,000. Ames thought the divorce might bankrupt him, and later said that this financial pressure was what had first led him to consider spying for the Soviets. Rosario had also proven to be a heavy spender, going on shopping sprees and phoning her family in Colombia at a cost of $400 a month. After her arrest, the FBI discovered 60 purses in the Ames&#x27; house, more than five hundred pairs of shoes, 165 unopened boxes of pantyhose and multiple designer dresses, noting &quot;at least a dozen looked like they were not yet worn&quot;. Also discovered were six men&#x27;s Rolex watches.

===Espionage===
Ames routinely assisted another CIA office that assessed Soviet embassy officials as potential intelligence assets. As part of this responsibility, and with the knowledge of both the CIA and the FBI, Ames began making contacts within the Soviet embassy.

In April 1985, Ames&#x27; espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union began. He provided information to the Soviets that he believed was &quot;essentially valueless&quot; but would establish his credentials as a CIA insider. In exchange for it, he asked for $50,000, which the Soviets quickly paid. Ames later claimed that he had not prepared for more than the initial &quot;con game&quot; to satisfy his immediate indebtedness but having &quot;crossed a line&quot; he &quot;could never step back&quot;.

Ames soon identified more than ten top-level CIA and FBI sources who were reporting on Soviet activities. Not only did Ames believe that there was &quot;as much money as [he] could ever use&quot; in betraying these intelligence assets, but their elimination would also reduce the chance of his own espionage being discovered. The CIA&#x27;s network of Soviet-bloc agents began disappearing at an alarming rate, including double agents Gennady Varenik and Dmitri Polyakov. The CIA realized something was wrong but was reluctant to consider the possibility of a mole within their agency. Initial investigations focused on possible breaches caused by Soviet bugs or a code that had been broken.

The CIA initially blamed asset losses on another former CIA agent, Edward Lee Howard, who had also been passing information to the Soviets. But when the agency lost three other important assets about whom Howard could not have known anything, it was clear that the arrests and resulting executions were the result of information provided by another source. One CIA officer said that the Soviets &quot;were wrapping up our cases with reckless abandon&quot;, which was highly unusual because the &quot;prevailing wisdom among the Agency&#x27;s professional &#x27;spy catchers was that suddenly eliminating all the assets known to the mole would put him in danger. In fact, Ames&#x27; KGB handlers apologized to him, saying they disagreed with that course of action, but that the decision to immediately eliminate all American assets had been made at the highest political levels.

Meanwhile, Ames continued to meet openly with his contact at the Soviet embassy, Sergey Dmitriyevich Chuvakhin. For a time, Ames summarized for the CIA and FBI the progress of what he portrayed as an attempt to recruit Chuvakhin. Ames received $20,000 to $50,000 every time the two had lunch. Ultimately, Ames received $4.6 million from the Soviets, which allowed him to enjoy a lifestyle well beyond the means of a CIA officer. In August 1985, when Ames&#x27; divorce became final, he immediately married Rosario Casas Dupuy. Understanding that his new wealth would raise eyebrows, he developed a cover story that his prosperity was the result of money given to him by his Colombian wife&#x27;s wealthy family. Ames wired considerable amounts of his espionage payments to his new in-laws in Bogotá to help improve their impoverished status.

In mid-May 1985, someone apparently reported to the Soviets that Oleg Gordievsky, their chief of station in London, was sending secrets to MI6, which he had been doing, under great secrecy, for 11 years. On May 17, 1985, Gordievsky was recalled to Moscow, where he was drugged and interrogated about his alleged communications with MI6. There was great suspicion that Ames had reported Gordievsky&#x27;s activity to Soviet counterintelligence. In June 1994, however, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;After six weeks of questioning Ames ... the FBI and CIA remain baffled about whether Ames or someone else first warned the Soviets about Gordievsky&quot;. An FBI agent reported that Ames had not advised the Soviets about Gordievsky until June 13, 1985. By that time, the spy was under KGB surveillance, although he had not been charged with treason as of July 19, 1985, when MI6 agents began to exfiltrate him to Britain.

In 1986, following the loss of several CIA assets, Ames told the KGB that he feared he would be a suspect. The KGB threw U.S. investigators off Ames&#x27; trail by constructing an elaborate diversion, in which a Soviet case officer told a CIA contact that the mole was stationed at Warrenton Training Center (WTC) in Warrenton, Virginia, a secret CIA communications facility in Virginia. Mole hunters investigated ninety employees at WTC for almost a year and came up with ten suspects, although the lead investigator noted that &quot;there are so many problem personalities that no one stands out&quot;.

In 1986, Ames was posted to Rome, where his performance once again ranged from mediocre to poor and again included evidence of his problematic drinking. Regardless, from 1990 to 1991, he was reassigned to the CIA&#x27;s Counterintelligence Center Analysis Group, which provided him with access to &quot;extremely sensitive data&quot;, including information on American double agents.

Later, after he defected, Gordievsky spoke highly of the information that Ames had provided to the KGB, stating that &quot;the significance of Ames was huge&quot; and that the Soviets were impressed with the &quot;quality and quantity&quot; of secrets that he had delivered.

===CIA response===

In late 1986, the CIA assembled a team to investigate the source of the leaks. Led by Paul Redmond, and including Jeanne Vertefeuille, Sandra Grimes, Diana Worthen, and Dan Payne, the team examined different possible causes, including the possibilities that the KGB had bugged the agency, or intercepted its communications, or had a mole in place. By 1990, the CIA was certain that there was a mole in the agency, but was unable to identify the exact source. Recruitment of new Soviet agents was brought to a near halt, since the agency feared it could not protect its current assets.

Prior to that, in November 1989, a fellow employee reported that Ames seemed to be enjoying a lifestyle well beyond the means of a CIA officer, and that his wife&#x27;s family was less wealthy than he had claimed. Worthen, one of the members of the mole hunt team, knew Rosario prior to her marriage and had met with her one day to discuss installing drapes in the Ames residence. Worthen had recently installed drapes in her own home and knew they could be expensive. She asked which room to concentrate on first, to which Rosario laughed and said, &quot;Do not worry about the price, we are going to have the whole house done at once!&quot; Worthen also knew that Rosario&#x27;s parents had little money, and a CIA contact in Bogotá observed that her family was now well-off. Nevertheless, the CIA moved slowly. When the investigator assigned to look at Ames&#x27; finances began a two-month training course, no one immediately replaced him. Investigators were also diverted by a false story from a CIA officer abroad who claimed that the Soviets had penetrated the CIA with an employee born in the USSR (Ames was born in River Falls, Wisconsin).

In 1986 and 1991, Ames passed two polygraph examinations while spying for the Soviet Union. He was initially &quot;terrified&quot; at the prospect of taking the test but was advised by the KGB &quot;to just relax&quot;. Ames&#x27; test demonstrated deceptive answers to some questions, but the examiners passed him. In the later opinion of the CIA, this was because the examiners were &quot;overly friendly&quot; and therefore did not induce the proper physiological response.

The CIA finally focused on Ames after co-workers noted his sharper personal appearance, including:
* Cosmetic dentistry: Ames&#x27; teeth, which were yellowed as a result of heavy smoking, had been capped
* Attire: Ames had been known for &quot;bargain basement&quot; attire, but suddenly changed to wearing tailor-made suits not even his superiors could afford

The CIA also realized that, despite Ames&#x27; annual salary of $60,000, he could afford:
* A $540,000 house in Arlington County, Virginia, which he paid for in cash
* A $50,000 Jaguar luxury car
* Home remodeling and redecoration costs of $99,000
* Monthly phone bills exceeding $6,000, mostly calls by Ames&#x27; wife to her family in Colombia
* Servants from the Philippines, whose travel to and from the States was paid for by Ames

In March 1993, the CIA and FBI began an intensive investigation of Ames that included electronic surveillance, combing through his trash, and installing a monitor in his car to track his movements. From November 1993 until his arrest, Ames was kept under virtually constant physical surveillance. In early 1994, when he was scheduled to attend a conference in Moscow, the FBI believed it could wait no longer, and he and his wife were arrested on February 21. At his arrest, Ames told officers, &quot;You&#x27;re making a big mistake! You must have the wrong man!&quot;

On February 22, 1994, Ames and his wife were formally charged by the Department of Justice with spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. He pleaded guilty on April 28, and received a sentence of life imprisonment. As part of a plea bargain by Ames, his wife received a lesser sentence of a five-year prison sentence for tax evasion and conspiracy to commit espionage.

In court, Ames admitted that he had compromised &quot;virtually all Soviet agents of the CIA and other American and foreign services known to me&quot; and had provided the USSR and Russia with a &quot;huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies&quot;. It is estimated that information Ames provided to the Soviets led to the compromise of at least 100 American intelligence operations and the execution of at least ten sources. Ames&#x27; betrayal of CIA methods also allowed the KGB to use &quot;controlled agents&quot; to feed the U.S. both genuine intelligence and disinformation from 1986 to 1993. Some of this &quot;feed material&quot; was incorporated into CIA intelligence reports, several of which even reached three U.S. presidents.

Ames said he was not afraid of being caught by the FBI or CIA but was afraid of Soviet defectors, saying, &quot;Virtually every American who has been jailed in connection with espionage has been fingered by a Soviet source&quot;. Additionally, when asked about the polygraph tests, Ames said, &quot;There&#x27;s no special magic. Confidence is what does it. Confidence and a friendly relationship with the examiner. Rapport, where you smile and you make him think that you like him. Making the examiner believe that the exam has no importance to you seals the deal.&quot;

== Post-sentence ==
Ames is incarcerated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons as prisoner #40087-083, serving his life sentence in the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Terre Haute, Indiana.

The CIA was criticized for not focusing on Ames sooner, given the obvious increase in his standard of living. There was a &quot;huge uproar&quot; in Congress when CIA Director James Woolsey decided that no one in the agency would be dismissed or demoted in relation to Ames&#x27; espionage. &quot;Some have clamored for heads to roll in order that we could say that heads have rolled,&quot; Woolsey declared. &quot;Sorry, that&#x27;s not my way.&quot; Woolsey later resigned under pressure.

Ames&#x27; attorney, Plato Cacheris, threatened to litigate the legality of the FBI&#x27;s searches and seizures in Ames&#x27; home and office without conventional search warrants, although Ames&#x27; guilty plea made the threat moot. Congress then passed a new law that granted specific power to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to authorize such searches. Ames was ineligible for a death sentence due to the uproar about the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted of carrying out espionage for the Soviet Union and were executed at Sing Sing in Ossining, New York, in June 1953. Following Ames&#x27; espionage, however, Congress reinstated the death penalty for foreign espionage.

== CIA sources compromised ==
* Vitaly Yurchenko was a KGB officer in the Fifth Department of Directorate K, &quot;the highest-ranking KGB officer ever to defect to the United States&quot;. In August 1985, he defected to the U.S. via Rome, only to return to the Soviet Union three months later. Ames was privy to all information that Yurchenko gave to the CIA and was able to transmit it to the KGB, which allowed easy cover-ups of lost information. Upon his return to the Soviet Union, Yurchenko was reassigned to a desk job within the FCD as a reward for helping to keep Ames&#x27; spying a secret.
* Major General Dmitri Polyakov was the highest-ranking figure in the GRU, giving information to the CIA from the early 1960s until his retirement in 1980. He was executed in 1988 after Ames exposed him. Polyakov was probably the most valuable asset compromised by Ames. One CIA official said of Polyakov: &quot;He didn&#x27;t do this for money. He insisted on staying in place to help us.&quot;
* Colonel Oleg Gordievsky was the head of the London &quot;rezidentura&quot; (station) and spied for MI6. Ames handed over information about Gordievsky that positively identified him as a double agent, although Gordievsky managed to escape to the Finnish border, where he was extracted to the United Kingdom via Norway by MI6 before he could be detained in the Soviet Union.
* Adolf Tolkachev was an electrical engineer who was one of the chief designers at the Phazotron company, which produces military radars and avionics. Tolkachev passed information to the CIA between 1979 and 1985, compromising multiple radar and missile secrets, as well as turning over classified information on avionics. He was arrested in 1985 after being compromised by both Ames and Edward Lee Howard, and was executed in 1986.
* Valery Martinov was a Line X (Technical &amp; Scientific Intelligence) officer at the Washington &quot;rezidentura&quot;. He revealed the identities of fifty Soviet intelligence officers operating from the embassy and technical and scientific targets that the KGB had penetrated. After being identified by Ames, he was tapped by the KGB to escort a suspected spy to Moscow; however, this was a ruse. Martynov was arrested, interrogated, and charged with espionage upon his return. He was executed in 1987.
* Major Sergei Motorin was a Line PR (political intelligence) officer at the Washington &quot;rezidentura&quot;, whom the FBI tried to blackmail into spying for the Americans. He eventually cooperated for his own reasons. Motorin was one of two moles at the &quot;rezidentura&quot; betrayed by Ames and was executed in 1988.
* Colonel Leonid Poleshchuk was a Line KR (counterintelligence) agent in Nigeria, also betrayed by Ames. His arrest was attributed to a chance encounter in which KGB agents had observed a CIA agent loading a dead drop. After some time, Poleshchuk was seen removing the contents. He was eventually tried and executed.
* Sergey Fedorenko was a nuclear weapons expert assigned to the Soviet delegation to the United Nations. In 1977, Ames was assigned to handle him, and Fedorenko provided information about the Soviet missile program to Ames. The two men became good friends, hugging when Fedorenko was about to return to Moscow. &quot;We had become close friends&quot;, said Ames. &quot;We trusted each other completely.&quot; Ames was initially hesitant to inform on Fedorenko, but soon after handing over the majority of the information, he decided to betray him to &quot;do a good job&quot; for the KGB. Back in the USSR, Fedorenko used political connections to get himself out of trouble. Years later, Fedorenko met his friend Ames for an emotional reunion over lunch and promised to move to the U.S. for good. Ames promised to help. Shortly after the lunch, Ames betrayed him to the KGB for a second time. Fedorenko escaped arrest, defected, and is currently living in Rhode Island.
* In a 2004 interview with Howard Phillips Hart, who was the CIA Station Chief of Bonn in the late 1980s, it was revealed that in 1988, Ames also betrayed a Mikoyan Gurevich Design Bureau engineer who had been working with the CIA for fourteen years and had provided complete technical, test, and research data on all of the Soviet Union&#x27;s fighter jets. According to Hart, his information &quot;allowed the US Government to prevent the skies from being blacked out by Soviet bombers, saved us billions of dollars ... since we knew precisely what they could do&quot;.

Tennent H. Bagley, a high-level CIA counterintelligence officer and Yuri Nosenko&#x27;s long-term case officer, said in a follow-up to his 2007 Yale University Press book, &quot;Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries and Deadly Games&quot;, that &quot;a KGB veteran even thought that &#x27;most&#x27; of the CIA spies inside the KGB who were betrayed by CIA traitor Aldrich Ames in 1985 were in fact loyal [KGB] staffers pretending to help the CIA.&quot; Bagley&#x27;s source for his statement was &quot;Aleksandr Kouzminov, &quot;Biological Espionage: Special Operations in the Soviet and Russian Foreign Intelligence Services in the West&quot;, (London: Greenhill Books, 2005), p. 59.&quot;

In &quot;Spy Wars&quot; itself, Bagley goes into great detail explaining why he believed Vitaly Yurchenko, whom Ames allegedly betrayed, was a Kremlin-loyal false defector all along.

== Aldrich Ames and Jonathan Pollard ==
Rafi Eitan, the Israeli handler of Jonathan Pollard, alleged that Pollard was blamed for some of Ames&#x27; crimes. Pollard went on to serve thirty years in prison for passing classified information to Israel. Eitan stated that Pollard never exposed American agents in the Soviet Union or elsewhere, and that he believed Ames tried to blame Pollard to clear himself of suspicion. &quot;I have no doubt that had Pollard been tried today, in light of what is known about Ames and other agents who were exposed, he would have received a much lighter sentence&quot;.

<text>Sudden Fear is a 1952 American film noir thriller film starring Joan Crawford and Jack Palance in a tale about a successful woman who marries a murderous man. Directed by David Miller, the screenplay by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith was based upon the novel of the same name by Edna Sherry.

==Plot==
Myra Hudson (Crawford) is a successful Broadway playwright who rejects Lester Blaine (Palance) as the lead in her new play. Later, she meets him on a train bound for San Francisco, is swept off her feet, and after a brief courtship, marries him.

Lester is unaware that Myra is making changes to her will, which will ensure he will inherit everything. She has begun dictating them into her personal dictating machine, but is interrupted when guests begin to arrive for the evening. She forgets to turn the machine off, and later, when Lester and his long-time lover, Irene Neves (Grahame), are in Myra&#x27;s study, they find the original will, which stipulates that the bulk of her fortune be left to a foundation. Irene suggests Myra&#x27;s murder; unknown to the couple, their subsequent plotting is recorded.

Myra hears the recording, and is devastated. In her haste to take the incriminating record to others, she drops and breaks it. Frantically trying to think how to proceed, she suddenly concocts a scheme of her own to kill Lester and place the blame on Irene.

Using her writing skills, she sets out a plan, but the complex timing — and her alibi — begins to unravel. She fakes a message to Irene from Lester to get her out of the way. While hiding in Irene&#x27;s apartment waiting for Lester, Myra catches her reflection in a mirror and is horrified at the sight of herself holding a gun. She decides to abandon the plan, but it is too late; Lester has learned of her intentions, and after life-and-death shifts in everybody&#x27;s murderous aims, ultimately ends up chasing Myra in his car through the streets of San Francisco. On foot, Myra is able to avoid him, although he gets out of the car in pursuit, and she has to hide. He returns to the car and drives around looking for her.

Unbeknownst to him, Irene is returning to her house, wondering why he has not turned up. He eventually mistakes Irene for Myra, and aims the car at her. Myra, seeing this at the last minute, shouts to stop him, but it is too late. Lester crashes, killing both Irene and himself. Myra breathes a sigh of relief as she walks safely off into the night.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
When the film was released, the film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. H. Weiler, reviewed the film favorably: &quot;Joan Crawford should be credited with a truly professional performance in &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; ... The entire production has been mounted in excellent taste and, it must be pointed out, that San Francisco and Los Angeles, Bunker Hill area, in which most of the action takes place, is an excitingly photogenic area. David Miller, the director, has taken full advantage of the city&#x27;s steep streets and panoramic views. And, in his climactic scenes in a darkened apartment and a chase through its precipitous dark alleys and backyards he has managed to project an authentically doom-filled atmosphere.&quot;

Otis L. Guernsey Jr., also wrote a positive review in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. He wrote: &quot;The scenario...is designed to allow Miss Crawford a wide range of quivering reactions to vicious events, as she passes through the stage of starry-eyed love, terrible disillusionment, fear, hatred, and finally hysteria. With her wide eyes and forceful bearing, she is the woman for the job.&quot;

&quot;Village Voice&quot; reviewer Melissa Anderson wrote in 2016 that &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; &quot;fits into and defies different genres, its convention-scrambling partly the result of the fact that the film looks both forward and back.&quot; Dennis Schwartz liked the film, but questioned some of the film&#x27;s plot points, saying that &quot;David Miller stylishly directs this disturbing psychological gargoyle thriller ... [Yet] ... the suspense is marred by plot devices that don&#x27;t hold up to further scrutiny. Joan Crawford has a chance to act out on her hysteria after her happy marriage is unmasked as a charade, and does a fine job of trying to remain calm while knowing her hubby and [his] girlfriend are planning to kill her ... The film is grandly topped off by Charles B. Lang Jr. and his remarkably glossy black-and-white photography.&quot;

In 1984, film noir historian Spencer Selby noted, &quot;Undoubtedly one of the most stylish and refined woman-in-distress noirs.&quot;

==Accolades==
Joan Crawford received her third and final Oscar nomination for this film, the only time she competed against arch-rival Bette Davis for Best Actress, who was nominated (for the tenth time) for &quot;The Star&quot;. Neither actress won (Shirley Booth took home the award for &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;).

==Home media==
&quot;Sudden Fear&quot; was first released on VHS by Kino Video. Kino also released the film on Region 1 DVD in 2003. In 2006, the film was also released as part of &quot;Film Noir - The Dark Side of Hollywood&quot; DVD box set by Kino Video. In 2016, the film was released on Blu-ray by Cohen Film Collection.

<text>The Star is a 1952 American drama film directed by Stuart Heisler and starring Bette Davis, Sterling Hayden and Natalie Wood. The plot tells the story of an aging, washed-up actress who is desperate to restart her career. Even though the film was a critical and commercial failure, Bette Davis received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

==Plot==
Oscar-winning star Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Elliot (Bette Davis) is a broke actress struggling to accept her new, non-wealthy reality. She is in denial, and confident she somehow can re-launch her career to its earlier brilliance. After suffering another big disappointment while vainly striving to get one good role, she gets drunk, gets arrested for DUI, and spends a night in jail. She is bailed out by Jim Johannsen (Sterling Hayden), a younger former actor whom she had helped in the past. Jim, now comfortably settled as the owner of a boatyard, admits that he has loved her ever since those days, and helped by Margaret&#x27;s daughter Gretchen (Natalie Wood), tries to help Margaret see that her days as a famous actress are already over. She reluctantly tries to work as a saleswoman in an upscale department store, but gossip from two customers wounds her pride and she runs out. Her old agent manages to get her a screen test for a role in a film she&#x27;d always wanted to play. She takes the screen test for a supporting role, believing that if she plays that character as a sexy younger woman, rather than the middle-aged frump she is seen as by the studio, she might be able to win the more coveted lead role. It does not work.

At a Hollywood party thrown by her agent, she is offered a role in a new film about a fallen star who can&#x27;t face the fact that it&#x27;s all over. This new script is dedicated to washed-up actors and actresses who are obsessed by their former glory, by what they used to look like, what kind of an impression they’d make to stay on top, and how they behaved; demanding, bribing, power-hungry. It would be a story about those who can&#x27;t look down and can&#x27;t accept that their moment of glory is over and that the world has passed them by. Hearing the pitch delivered right to her face, and that she&#x27;d be the perfect actress to play the role, seems to have finally helped Margaret realize the cold truth about her future. She realizes that her film career is over, and she flees the party to the open arms of Jim and the love and acceptance of her daughter, from whom Margaret desperately tried to shield her failing career.

==Cast==

* Bette Davis as Margaret Elliot
* Sterling Hayden as Jim Johannsen
* Natalie Wood as Gretchen
* Warner Anderson as Harry Stone
* Minor Watson as Joe Morrison
* June Travis as Phyllis Stone
* Paul Frees as Richard Stanley
* Robert Warwick as R.J., aging actor at party
* Barbara Lawrence as herself
* Fay Baker as Margaret&#x27;s sister
* Herb Vigran as Margaret&#x27;s brother-in-law, Roy
==Production==

Katherine Albert and her husband Dale Eunson reportedly based the Margaret Elliot character on Joan Crawford, whose long friendship with the couple was ending as production began. Although it is sometimes said that she turned the role down, it never was offered to her. Bette Davis, who publicly disdained Crawford, thus eagerly took it.

Crawford retaliated after the Eunsons sent their daughter, starlet Joan Evans, Crawford&#x27;s god-daughter, to the actress in the hope that Crawford would talk her out of marrying at age 17. Instead, Crawford arranged the wedding, held it in her house, and called the Eunsons afterward to tell them about it. &quot;She set the whole thing up behind our backs&quot;, Albert complained. &quot;She called the judge and the press. She didn&#x27;t invite us to our own daughter&#x27;s wedding.&quot;

<doc id="187108" wikidata="Q1286778" url="?curid=187108" title="Jib">
<text>A jib is a triangular sail that sets ahead of the foremast of a sailing vessel. Its forward corner (tack) is fixed to the bowsprit, to the bows, or to the deck between the bowsprit and the foremost mast. Jibs and spinnakers are the two main types of headsails on a modern boat.

==Modern yachts and small craft==
Boats may be sailed using a jib alone, but more commonly jibs make a minor direct contribution to propulsion compared to a main sail. Generally, a jib&#x27;s most crucial function is as an airfoil, increasing performance and overall stability by reducing turbulence on the main sail&#x27;s leeward side.
On boats with only one jib, it is common for the clew of the jib to be abaft the mast, meaning the jib and mainsail overlap. An overlapping jib is called a &quot;genoa jib&quot; or simply a genoa (see illustration). These are efficiently used when reaching more broadly than a close reach. Alternatively, a boat may carry smaller jibs, to compensate aerodynamics when the main sail is reefed; these more rugged sails are called &quot;storm jibs&quot; or &quot;spitfires&quot;.

On a boat with two staysails the inner sail is called the &quot;staysail&quot;, and the outer (foremost) is called the jib. This combination of two staysails is called a &quot;cutter rig&quot; (or in North America a &quot;yankee pair&quot;) and a boat with one mast rigged with two staysails and a mainsail is called a cutter.

On cruising yachts, and nearly all racing sailboats, the jib needs to be worked when tacking. On these yachts, there are two sheets attached to the clew of the jib. As the yacht comes head to wind during a tack, the active sheet is released, and the other sheet (the &quot;lazy sheet&quot;) on the other side of the boat is pulled in. This sheet becomes the new &quot;active sheet&quot; until the next tack.

==Traditional vessels==
Schooners typically have up to three jibs. The foremost one sets on the topmast forestay and is generally called the &quot;jib topsail&quot;, a second on the main forestay is called &quot;the jib&quot;, and the innermost is called &quot;the staysail&quot;. Actually, all three sails are both jibs and staysails in the generic sense.

Original usage in 18th and 19th century square-rigged ships distinguished between the fore staysail, set on the forestay running from the foremast head to the ship&#x27;s peak, the foremost part of the hull, and the jibs set on stays running to the bowsprit. Jibs, but not staysails, could also be &quot;set flying,&quot; i.e. not attached to the standing rigging. Sails set beyond the peak were typically called jibs, set on stays running from the fore topmast to the bowsprit, or the fore topgallant mast to the jibboom or even the fore royal mast to the flying jibboom. A large square-rigged ship typically has four jibs, but could have as many as six.

From forward to aft, these sails are called:

* Jib of jibs
* Spindle jib
* Flying jib
* Outer jib
* Inner jib
* Fore (topmast) staysail.

The first two were rarely used except by clipper ships in light winds and were usually set flying. A storm jib was a small jib of heavy canvas set to a stay to help to control the ship in bad weather.

==Idiom==
The jib is referenced in the idiom usually spoken as &quot;I like the cut of your jib&quot;, generally seen as signifying approval of one&#x27;s general appearance or respect for their character. The phrase alludes to the maritime practice of identifying far-away ships by noting the &quot;cut&quot; (general shape and configuration) of their sails to determine their status as friend or foe. One such report from the &quot;Naval Chronicle&quot; (1805)—&quot;we perceived by the cut of their sails, then set, that they were French Ships of War&quot;—is often cited as an early inspiration for the idiom.

Sir Walter Scott used the expression to denote approval in the 1824 novel &quot;St. Ronan&#x27;s Well&quot;: &quot;If she disliked what the sailor calls the &quot;cut of their jib&quot;. John Russell Bartlett later defined the idiom in his 1848 &quot;Dictionary of Americanisms&quot; as &quot;The form of his profile, the cast of his countenance&quot;. This usage alludes to a frequent variation of meaning which describes approval, specifically, of the shape of one&#x27;s nose, which roughly approximates the frontal position and triangular shape of the jib sail on a boat.

<text>Julia Ann Harris (December 2, 1925August 24, 2013) was an American actress. Renowned for her classical and contemporary roles, she earned numerous accolades including the record five Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Play, three Emmy Awards, and a Grammy Award in addition to nominations for an Academy Award, and a BAFTA Award. She was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1979, received the National Medal of Arts in 1994, the Special Lifetime Achievement Tony Award, and the Kennedy Center Honor in 2005.

After making her Broadway debut in 1945 Harris went on to win five Tony Awards for Best Actress in a Play for her roles in &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (1952), &quot;The Lark&quot; (1956), &quot;Forty Carats&quot; (1969), &quot;The Last of Mrs. Lincoln&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot; (1977). Her other Tony-nominated roles were in &quot;Marathon &#x27;33&quot; (1964), &quot;Skyscraper&quot; (1966), &quot;The au Pair Man&quot; (1974), &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Child&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Gin Game&quot; (1997).

She starred in the 1950 play &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;, a role she reprised in the 1952 film of the same name, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Her other notable film roles include &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955), &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (1955), &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963), and &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1967). Harris received three Primetime Emmy Awards for her roles in &quot;Little Moon of Alban&quot; (1969), &quot;Victoria Regina&quot; (1962), and &quot;Not for Ourselves Alone&quot; (1999). She won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot; (1978)

==Early life and education==
Julia Ann Harris was born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, the daughter of Elsie L. (née Smith), a nurse, and William Pickett Harris, an investment banker and authority on zoology. She had an older brother, William, and a younger brother, Richard. She graduated from Grosse Pointe Country Day School, which later merged with two others to form the University Liggett School. In New York City, she attended The Hewitt School. As a teenager, she also trained at the Perry-Mansfield Performing Arts School &amp; Camp in Colorado with Charlotte Perry, a mentor who encouraged Harris to apply to the Yale School of Drama, which she soon attended for a year. In 2007, Yale bestowed an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree upon Harris. As a founding member of Lee Strasberg&#x27;s Actors Studio, Harris studied method acting, which emphasized psychology and emotions, and although it was strongly associated with male actors, she was able to successfully employ its techniques.

==Career==
===1945–1959: Early roles ===

In 1952, Harris won her first Best Actress Tony Award for originating the role of insouciant Sally Bowles in &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, the stage version of Christopher Isherwood&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; (later adapted as the Broadway musical &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966) and as the 1972 film, with Liza Minnelli as Sally). Harris repeated her stage role in the film version of &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (1955). Harris&#x27;s screen debut was in 1952, repeating her Broadway success as the lonely teenaged girl Frankie in Carson McCullers&#x27;s &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Director Elia Kazan cast her in &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955) opposite James Dean in his first major screen role.

Harris was nominated for 11 Primetime Emmy Awards for her television work, winning three. She starred as Nora Helmer opposite Christopher Plummer in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1959), a 90-minute television adaptation of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play. She made more appearances in leading roles on the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; than any other actress, also appearing in two different adaptations of the play &quot;Little Moon of Alban&quot;, her performance in the 1958 TV movie of the same name earning her the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

===1960–1989: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

She played the ethereal Eleanor Lance in &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963), director Robert Wise&#x27;s screen adaptation of a novel by Shirley Jackson. Another cast member recalled Harris refusing to socialize with the other actors while not on set, later explaining that she had done so as a method of emphasizing the alienation from the other characters experienced by her character in the film. Other notable films Harris appeared in during the 1960s include &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; (1962), &quot;Harper&quot; (with Paul Newman) (1966), and &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; (1967). Another noteworthy film appearance was the World War II drama &quot;The Hiding Place&quot; (1975).

Her second Emmy win came for her role as Queen Victoria in the 1961 &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; production of Laurence Housman&#x27;s &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;. She received further Emmy nominations for a range of roles including &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1967), &quot;The Last of Mrs. Lincoln&quot; (1976)—where she reprised her Tony-winning role as Mary Todd Lincoln from the 1973 play of the same name—and &quot;The Woman He Loved&quot; (1988). She won her third Emmy award in 2000 for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for her voice role of Susan B. Anthony in &quot;Not for Ourselves Alone&quot;.

Of particular note is her Tony-winning performance in &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot;, a one-woman play (written by William Luce and directed by Charles Nelson Reilly) based on the life and poetry of Emily Dickinson. She received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Recording for the audio recording of the play. She first performed the play in 1976 and subsequently appeared in other solo shows, including Luce&#x27;s &quot;Brontë&quot;. Harris holds the Tonys record as the person with most wins (5) and nominations (9) in the Lead Actress in a Play category. Other Broadway credits include &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;, &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Skyscraper&quot;, &quot;And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little&quot;, &quot;Forty Carats&quot;, &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;The Gin Game&quot;, and a North American tour in 1992 of &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; in the lead part originated by Maggie Smith on Broadway.

In 1980, Harris guest starred in the series &quot;Knots Landing&quot; as country singer Lilimae Clements, the eccentric and protective mother of Valene Ewing (Joan Van Ark); she returned to the series as a regular character from 1981 to 1987. The role earned Harris a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and two Soap Opera Digest Award nominations. In 1983, Harris became a company member of The Mirror Theater Ltd&#x27;s Mirror Repertory Company. She became a mentor to the company, having urged Founding Artistic Director Sabra Jones to create the company from 1976 forward, when Jones married John Strasberg. Harris and Jones met at a performance of &quot;The Belle of Amherst&quot;, a revival of which The Mirror Theater Ltd recently performed in their summer home in Vermont.

===1990–2009: Established actress ===
Harris made two recordings of narrations of E. B. White&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Stuart Little&quot; for the Pathways of Sound record label: the last six chapters for a single LP record in 1965, and the entire book for a two-record set in 1979. She also recorded narrations of many children&#x27;s books for Caedmon Records. Harris also did extensive voiceover work for documentary maker Ken Burns: the voices of Emily Warren Roebling in &quot;Brooklyn Bridge&quot; (1981), Ann Lee in &quot;The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God&quot; (1984), and most notably Southern diarist Mary Boykin Chesnut for Burns&#x27; 1990 series &quot;The Civil War&quot;.

In the summer of 2008, she appeared on stage again in Chatham, Massachusetts, as &quot;Nanny&quot; in a Monomoy Theater production of &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;. Harris continued to work until 2009, well into her eighties, narrating five historical documentaries by Christopher Seufert and Mooncusser Films, as well as being active as a director on the board of the independent Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theater (WHAT). In 2007, when the company built a new, additional theater, also in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, Ms Harris declined to have the building named for her. However, she consented to their naming &quot;a piece of it after me&quot;; WHAT named their stage the &quot;Julie Harris Stage&quot;.

==Personal life==
Harris lived in West Chatham, Cape Cod, for many years until her death. Three times divorced, she had one son, Peter Gurian. A breast cancer survivor, she suffered a severe fall requiring surgery in 1999, a stroke in 2001, and a second stroke in 2010.

Harris died on August 24, 2013, of congestive heart failure at her home in West Chatham, Massachusetts. Harris was cremated after her death.

== Legacy and honors ==

On December 5, 2005, Harris was named a Kennedy Center Honoree. At a White House ceremony, President George W. Bush remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine the American stage without the face, the voice, and the limitless talent of Julie Harris. She has found happiness in her life&#x27;s work, and we thank her for sharing that happiness with the whole world.&quot;

Ben Brantley, theater critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, considered her &quot;the actress who towered most luminously ... rather like a Statue of Liberty for Broadway.&quot; Alec Baldwin, who played Harris&#x27;s son on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, praised her in a tribute in the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;: &quot;Her voice was like rainfall. Her eyes connected directly to and channeled the depths of her powerful and tender heart. Her talent, a gift from God.&quot;

Harris ties with Angela Lansbury with five Tony Award wins (Audra McDonald has since passed them both, with six wins). However, she holds the record (alongside Chita Rivera) for the most individual Tony Award nominations, with 10 (Audra McDonald has also since received her 10th nomination). In 1966, Harris won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre.

On August 28, 2013, Broadway theaters dimmed their lights for one minute in honor of Harris.

On December 3, 2013, Joan Van Ark announced at a Broadway memorial service the creation of the Julie Harris Scholarship, which provides annual support to an actor studying at the Yale School of Drama. Alec Baldwin made the first contribution. In 2021, Yale Drama became tuition-free and was rebranded the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University.

<text>The &#x27; (Latin, &quot;Altar of Augustan Peace&quot;; commonly shortened to &#x27;) is an altar in Rome dedicated to the Pax Romana. The monument was commissioned by the Roman Senate on July 4, 13 BC to honour the return of Augustus to Rome after three years in Hispania and Gaul and consecrated on January 30, 9 BC. Originally located on the northern outskirts of Rome, a Roman mile from the boundary of the &quot;pomerium&quot; on the west side of the Via Flaminia, the Ara Pacis stood in the northeastern corner of the Campus Martius, the former flood plain of the Tiber River and gradually became buried under of silt deposits. It was reassembled in its current location, now the Museum of the Ara Pacis, in 1938, turned 90° counterclockwise from its original orientation so that the original western side now faces south.

==Significance==

The altar reflects the Augustan vision of Roman civil religion. The lower register of its frieze depicts agricultural work meant to communicate the abundance and prosperity of the Roman Peace (). The monument as a whole serves a dual civic ritual and propaganda function for Augustus and his regime, easing notions of autocracy and dynastic succession that might otherwise be unpalatable to traditional Roman culture.

==Structure==
The monument consists of a traditional open-air altar at its centre surrounded by precinct walls which are pierced on the eastern and western ends (so called today because of the modern layout) by openings and elaborately and finely sculpted entirely in Luna marble.

===Altar===
Within the enclosing precinct walls, the altar itself was carved with images illustrating the &quot;lex aria&quot;, the law governing the ritual performed at the altar. The sacrificial procession depicts animals being led to sacrifice by figures carved in a Republican style similar to the so-called &quot;Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus&quot;, in sharp contrast with the style on the exterior of the precinct walls. What remains of the altar is otherwise fragmentary, but it appears to have been largely functional with less emphasis on art and decoration.

The interior of the precinct walls are carved with bucrania, ox skulls, from which carved garlands hang. The garlands bear fruits from various types of plants, all displayed on a single garland as allegorical representations of plenty and abundance. The bucrania in turn evoke the idea of sacrificial piety, appropriate motifs for the interior of the altar precinct. The lower register of the interior walls imitate the appearance of traditionally wooden altar precincts, which were meant to bring to mind other such altars in Rome and the tradition of constructing altars at the boundary of the city&#x27;s &quot;pomerium.&quot;

===Exterior wall decoration===

The exterior walls of the Ara Pacis are divided between allegorical and pseudo-historical relief panels on the upper register while the lower register comprises scenes of nature: harmonic, intertwined vines that contain wildlife and connote nature under control. The upper register of the northern and southern walls depict scenes of the emperor, his family, and members of the regime in the act of processing to or performing a sacrifice. Various figures in togas are shown with their heads covered (&quot;capite velato&quot;), signifying their role as both priests and sacrificiants. Other figures wear laurel crowns, traditional Roman symbols of victory. Members of individual priestly colleges are depicted in traditional garb appropriate to their office, while lictors can be identified by their iconographic &quot;fasces&quot;. Women and children are also included among the procession; the depiction of children in Roman sculpture would have been novel at the time of the Altar&#x27;s construction, evoking themes of moral and familial piety, as well as easing concerns over dynastic intentions while simultaneously introducing potential heirs to the public eye. However, despite the emphasis on family values, the anonymity of many of the women depicted enforces the male retention of power within this new age of peace.

The western and eastern walls are both pierced by entryways to the altar, although the interior would only have been accessed by a stairway on the western side. The entryways were flanked by panels depicting allegorical or mythological scenes evocative of peace, piety and tradition. On the eastern wall, panels depicted the seated figures of Roma and Pax, while the western side depicts the discovery of the twins and she-wolf and the sacrifice of a figure traditionally identified as Aeneas, but increasingly believed to be Rome&#x27;s second king, Numa Pompilius. The identity of these various figures has been a point of some controversy over the years, relying heavily on interpretation of fragmentary remains, discussed below.

The sculpture of the Ara Pacis is primarily symbolic rather than decorative, and its iconography has several levels of significance. Studies of the Ara Pacis and similar public Roman monuments traditionally address the potent political symbolism of their decorative programs, and their emphasis and promulgation of dynastic and other imperial policies; they are usually studied as a form of imperial propaganda. The Ara Pacis is seen to embody without conscious effort the deep-rooted ideological connections among cosmic sovereignty, military force, and fertility that were first outlined by Georges Dumézil, connections which are attested in early Roman culture and more broadly in the substructure of Indo-European culture at large. Peter Holliday suggested that the Altar&#x27;s imagery of the Golden Age, usually discussed as mere poetic allusion, appealed to a significant component of the Roman populace. The program of the Ara Pacis addressed this group&#x27;s very real fears of cyclical history, and promised that the rule of Augustus would avert the cataclysmic destruction of the world predicted by contemporary models of historical thought.

===East and West walls===

The East and West walls each contain two panels, one well preserved and one represented only in fragments.

The East Wall contains a poorly preserved scene of a female warrior (), possibly Roma, apparently sitting on a pile of weapons confiscated from the enemy (war trophy), thus forcing peace upon them by rendering them unable to make war. This scene has been reconstructed, based on coins that depict such a seated Roma. When the monument was being reconstructed at its present site, Edmund Buchner and other scholars sketched what the panel may have looked like. This interpretation, although widely accepted, can not be proved correct, as so little of the original panel survives.

The other panel is more controversial in its subject, but far better preserved. A goddess sits amid a scene of fertility and prosperity with twins on her lap. Scholars have variously suggested that the goddess is Italia, Tellus (Earth), Venus Genetrix or Pax (Peace), although other views also circulate. Due to the widespread depiction around the sculpture of scenes of peace, and because the altar is named for &quot;peace&quot;, the favoured conclusion is that the goddess is Pax.

The West Wall also contains two panels. The fragmentary &quot;Lupercal Panel&quot; apparently preserves the moment when Romulus and Remus were discovered by Faustulus the shepherd, while Mars looks on. Again this panel is a modern drawing without much evidence. Marble fragments of the tree and the head and shoulder of Mars (if it is Mars) and part of a second individual (thought to be Faustulus) survive, but the addition of the she-wolf, Romulus, and Remus is entirely speculative.

The better preserved scene depicts the sacrifice of a pig (the standard sacrifice when Romans made a peace treaty) by an old priest and two attendants. In 1907, this scene was identified by Johannes Sieveking as the moment when Aeneas, newly arrived in Italy, sacrificed a sow and her 30 piglets to Juno, as told by Virgil and others, even though the scene differs greatly from Vergil&#x27;s description. In the 1960s, Stephan Weinstock challenged this identification (and the very identity of the entire monument), citing numerous discrepancies that Sieveking and his followers had failed to notice between Vergil&#x27;s version and the panel. Subsequently, the suggestion was made that the scene shows Numa Pompilius, the Roman king associated with Peace and the Gates of Janus. Paul Rehak later published an article with this proposal, confirmed in a chapter of his posthumous book. This theory has won over many scholars, despite considerable initial resistance.

===Figures===

The long friezes of the Ara Pacis (the North and South Walls) contain figures advancing towards the West, who participate in a state of thanksgiving to celebrate the Peace created by Augustus. These figures fall into four categories: lictors (men carrying fasces, bodyguards of magistrates); priests (three of the four major &quot;collegia&quot; – &quot;Pontifices&quot;, &quot;Septemviri&quot;, and &quot;Quindecimviri&quot;): women and children (generally from the imperial family, represented in portraiture); and attendants (a few anonymous figures necessary for religious purposes).

In addition there are two or three non-Roman children, who may be guests (or hostages) in Rome. Their identification by their non-Roman costume and their participation in the ceremony advertises to all that Rome is the centre of the world, and that other nations send their young to Rome to learn Roman ways, so great is Rome&#x27;s reputation. The ceremony took place in the summer of 13 BC, but not necessarily on 4 July, when the Senate voted to build the Ara Pacis.

====North wall====
The north wall has about 46 extant or partially extant figures. The first two foreground figures are lictors, carrying fasces (bundles of rods symbolizing Roman authority). The next set of figures consists of priests from the college of the Septemviri epulones, so identified by an incense box they carry with special symbols. One member of this college is missing in a gap.

After them follows the &quot;collegium&quot; of the &quot;quindecimviri sacris faciundis&quot;, also identified by the incense box carried by a public slave among them. Although the name suggests this college has exactly fifteen members, the size of the college has grown to 23, including Augustus and Agrippa, who appear on the South Frieze. The other twenty-one members are present here. Two very badly damaged figures in the middle are split by a gap. From photos, the gap appears to affect a single figure, but as Koeppel, Conlin, and Stern have proven, in-site examination reveals that one is a foreground and the other a background figure.

The last portion of the North Frieze consists of members of the imperial family. Many scholars used to identify the veiled, leading figure as Julia, daughter of Augustus, but since Julia appears on the South Frieze, it is more likely that this figure is Octavia Minor. Other figures in the entourage might include Marcella Major (a daughter of Octavia), Iullus Antonius (a son of Mark Antony), and two boys and a girl of the imperial family.

The smallest boy on the North Frieze used to be identified (in error) as Lucius Caesar. Lucius was four in 13 BC, but this child is far too small for a four year old. He might be two years old, and he is not at all dressed like a Roman. In fact, his rear end is showing. He is a barbarian German hostage. But based on work from the 1890s and 1930s, the identity of Lucius still persists among some scholars. Some scholars assumed this boy also was a participant in the Troy Games, although he is certainly too young (six or seven was the minimum age). If this toddler were Lucius, he would be too young and in the wrong costume for the Troy Games. The best guess is that he is a Germanic tribal prince, but he is certainly not a dressed as a Trojan. As Charles Brian Rose has noted, &quot;The variable value of the Eastern costume and the uneasy interaction of Trojan and Parthian iconography can make it difficult to determine whether one is viewing the founders of the Romans or their fiercest opponents.&quot; Despite many flaws in Kähler&#x27;s theory, it is still accepted by some scholars even today.

The youth wearing Hellenistic Greek clothing suited to a Hellenistic prince has been identified as Gaius in the guise of a &quot;camillus&quot;, an adolescent attendant of the Flamen Dialis. The Gaius identification is best supported by his size, however an additional boy in Roman dress who has a &quot;bulla&quot; (but has lost his head) is also the right size, and therefore a better guess. For Gaius to appear in public without his &quot;bulla&quot; would invite the evil eye. This same figure in Hellenistic dress has also been interpreted as Ptolemy of Mauretania representing Africa, along with the German boy (Europe) and the Parthian prince (Asia). A foreign prince would not wear a &quot;bulla&quot;.

====South wall====

The South Wall has seen a great deal of scholarship and the greatest number of academic debates. Unlike the North Wall, where most of the heads are new (not authentic ancient heads, but modern creations), the heads of the figures on the South Wall are mostly original. Some half dozen figures are recognizable from looking at other surviving statues of members of the imperial family. Nevertheless, much debate has taken place over many of these figures, including Augustus, Agrippa, Tiberius, Julia, and Antonia.

The figure of Augustus was not discovered until the 1903 excavation, and his head was damaged by the cornerstone of the Renaissance palazzo built on top of the original Ara Pacis site. Although he was identified correctly in 1903, Petersen, Strong, and Stuart-Jones initially saw the figure as the &quot;rex sacrorum&quot;. Today Augustus is better recognized by his hair style than his face.

In the absence of Augustus from the panel, early scholars debated whether Agrippa (the tall veiled priest) was Augustus or Agrippa or Lepidus. In 1907, Sieveking proposed that this figure was Lepidus, the &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot; in 13 BC. Sieveking later reversed his position with a series of peculiar suggestions. In 1926, Loewy compared the Ara Pacis Agrippa to the Louvre Agrippa and the Agrippa in Copenhagen (and elsewhere) in order to demonstrate the iconographical similarity. Aside from a very small minority of scholars (most vehemently defensive of Lepidus in &quot;Rom. Mitt&quot; in the 1930s was Ludwig Curtius), the rest of the academy concluded that this figure is Agrippa. Ryberg&#x27;s 1949 article gave further weight to that conclusion. With Agrippa appear a majestic woman, a child of about seven, and a teenaged girl leaning forwards from the background, putting her hand on the boy&#x27;s head. Together they are a partial family group, though many of Agrippa&#x27;s children are not present. In 13 BC, Agrippa had at least five daughters varying from one to 22 years old and two sons (already adopted by Augustus). A third son was born posthumously.

Many scholars continue to see the Julia figure as Livia, having reasoned that Livia has to be on the Ara Pacis. Indeed, Livia does appear somewhere (her exclusion is unlikely), but by 13 BC Julia had politically eclipsed Livia, as has been understood and explained by many scholars. The Julia identification dates back to Dütschke in 1880 and Milani in 1891. The Livia identity owes to Petersen, who has a very mixed record on identifying figures, in part because he insisted the procession dates to 9 BC, not 13 BC. Furthermore, Livia has no bond to Agrippa, whereas Julia was his wife and should be at his side, expected and expecting to be the unofficial empress of Rome for decades, during and beyond Augustus&#x27; lifetime. It is odd that the late Diana Kleiner, who advanced the grouping of people on the Ara Pacis in families in her 1978 article, failed to recognize this woman as Julia until late in her career, having for 25 years called her Livia. Julia also better personified Augustus&#x27; pro-natalist program, having already given birth to four surviving children (and was pregnant with a fifth), another issue Kleiner associated with the Ara Pacis women and children. Livia failed to have any children with Augustus. Surprisingly, a majority of scholars in 2000 preferred to see this figure as Livia. The tide has possibly turned back in favor of Julia by 2024. 

In 1894, and again in 1902 and 1903, Eugen Petersen suggested that Lucius Caesar appears with Agrippa. Later, it was argued that this figure is too small to be Lucius, so the consensus switched to Gaius Caesar. In 1954, Heinz Kähler claimed Gaius is dressed in a &quot;Trojan&quot; costume for the Troy Game held in 13 BC (see below). Many scholars, realizing by 1935 that Lucius was too young to be the boy beside Agrippa, preferred to identify him as Gaius. They named the smallest child on the North Frieze &quot;Lucius,&quot; even though he is a mere toddler (Lucius was four in 13 BC).

The Tiberius figure was identified as such by Milani, an identification that was rarely questioned until the 1940s. Moretti, in making the glass museum for the Ara Pacis at Mussolini&#x27;s command, guessed that the two consuls (Tiberius and Varus) of 13 flank Augustus, so he saw this figure as M. Valerius Messalla. V. H. von Poulsen and Toynbee proposed Iullus Antonius. But as has been well established, Augustus is flanked by priests, and this figure is Tiberius. Boschung and Bonanno have both matched the face to early period Tiberius statuary.

In relation to Antonia, Drusus, and Germanicus, H. Dütschke proposed in 1880 the correct identity for Antonia and Drusus, but incorrectly saw the toddler as Claudius. A. von Domaszewski amended this family identification and correctly saw the child as Germanicus. He also suggested that the Ara Pacis is arranged in family groups. He correctly determined that the two-year-old child could be only Germanicus, whose exact birth on 24 May 15 BC is known. This helps prove that the ceremony is an event in 13, although a few scholars continued to argue the ceremony was that of 9 BC (until definitive proof in favor of 13 came out in 1939).

In relation to the Domitii Ahenobarbi, von Domaszewski also proposed in the same 1903 article that the last family on the South Wall is that of the father of the emperor Nero (born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus). This identification remains widespread today. John Pollini provides the best summary of this viewpoint in his article, &quot;Ahenobarbi, Appuleii and Some Others on the Ara Pacis&quot;, where he points out that the writer Suetonius specifically mentions that Nero&#x27;s father went &quot;to the East on the staff of the young Gaius Caesar&quot;. As this campaign is known to have begun in 2 BC, it means that Gnaeus must have been of mature age by that time, therefore requiring a birth year of at least 17 BC, which would, in turn, make him sufficiently old to be the boy on the Ara Pacis. Pollini also reasons that the delay in Gnaeus&#x27; career (only reaching the consulship in 32 AD) resulted from his documented unpleasant character and points out that the careers of other members of the family with undesirable traits also suffered similar delays, notably Augustus&#x27; youngest grandson, Agrippa Postumus, who had no career, and Germanicus&#x27; brother, the later emperor, Claudius, whose career started late. However, there are some dissenters from this theory. Stern claims that these figures cannot possibly be the Domitii Ahenobarbi, on the basis of the belief that Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, whom von Domaszewski saw as the boy of the family, was born after the monument&#x27;s completion. Syme had also argued that Gnaeus was born after the monument&#x27;s completion, but accepted the identification of the Ahenobarbus family, preferring to identify the boy as an otherwise unknown elder brother and the girl figure as an otherwise unknown elder sister of Gnaeus—both of whom died young. Syme also proved somewhat unintentionally, based on the inscription &quot;ILS&quot; 6095 that Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was governor of Africa in 13 BC and could not be in Rome for the Ara Pacis ceremony.

Starting in 1894, Eugen Petersen suggested that Lucius Caesar appears between Augustus (his veiled Augustus is actually Agrippa) and Livia (actually Julia). Petersen had a good idea about families grouping together, but he identified none of the figures correctly in this place. In the 1920s as more and more scholars decided the scene dates to 13 BC, Loewy proposed that this boy was too young to be Lucius. He proposed Gaius. After Loewy&#x27;s 1926 article, consensus shifted to Gaius Caesar. Gaius, seven years old in 13 BC, fit better. Kähler canonized the idea that Gaius was dressed in a &quot;Trojan&quot; costume for the equestrian boys event called the Troy Game, which was also held in 13 for the dedication of the Theater of Marcellus but on a different occasion. This theory won universal acceptance for many decades, even though the evidence is overwhelmingly against. The boy is clearly not a Roman, given his clothing, lack of &quot;bulla&quot;, and hair style. So ingrained was Kähler&#x27;s theory, however, that when the distinguished scholar Erika Simon (1968, 18) suggested the boy is a barbarian, she was subjected to intense criticism until she retracted it. Subsequently, led by Charles Brian Rose and Ann Kuttner, North American scholars have realized Kähler was wrong: the boy is a foreign prince. Stern adds the costume is wrong for a Trojan (no Phrygian hat) and no &quot;bulla&quot; – worn by all Roman boys as protection from the evil eye. Many others have contributed to disprove Petersen&#x27;s theory.

==Excavation and conservation==

* In 1568, the first fragmentary sculptures were rediscovered beneath Palazzo Peretti in Lucina (a.k.a. Palazzo Fano-Almagià), right next to the basilica San Lorenzo in Lucina, close to &quot;Via del Corso&quot;, and have found their way to the Villa Medici, the Vatican, the Uffizi and the Louvre.
* In 1859 further sculptural fragments were found in the same area under the Teatro Olimpia, part of the Peretti Palace in via in Lucina, close to the Italian Parliament Building, and the sculptures were recognized as having belonged to the same monument.
* In 1903, well after Friedrich von Duhn had recognized that the reliefs belonged to the Ara Pacis (1879–81), known from Augustus&#x27; memoir, a request was sent to the Ministry of Public Education to continue the excavations. Their success was made possible by the generosity of Edoardo Almagià, who, as well as giving his permission for the exploration, donated in advance whatever should be discovered underneath the palace and made an ongoing financial contribution to the expenses of the excavation; by July of that year, it became clear that the conditions were extremely difficult and that the stability of the Teatro Olimpia might well be compromised; when about half the monument had been examined and 53 fragments recovered, the excavation was called to a halt.
* In 1909 it was decided that several buildings closely surrounding the Mausoleum of Augustus were to be destroyed to bring the mausoleum back to view.
* In 1918, right after the end of WW I, the President of the &quot;Piedmontese Society of Archaeology and Fine Arts&quot;, Oreste Mattirolo, for the first time suggested that all fragments were to be collected and joined to rebuild the altar.
* In 1932 demolition of buildings surrounding the mausoleum, decided in 1909, started, together with many other demolitions carried on in those years in the city.
* In February 1937, the Italian Cabinet decreed that for the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Augustus, the excavations should recommence, using the most advanced technology. Seventy cubic meters of ground under what was by then the Cinema Nuovo Olimpia were frozen, whilst the altar was extracted.
* The fragments, although not complete, were collected and joined to rebuild the Ara; due to the short time available (work had to be completed before 23 September 1938, the last day of the Augustan anniversary), few fragments available and poor historical sources to refer to for restoration (basically a couple of ancient Roman coins), the reconstruction had to be performed with the help of Italian artist Odoardo Ferretti.

=== Protective pavilion ===
In 1938 the finally reconstructed Ara was placed near the Mausoleum of Augustus, and a big pavilion was built around it by architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo as part of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s attempt to create an ancient Roman &quot;theme park&quot; to glorify Fascist Italy. Several dozen buildings surrounding the Mausoleum were levelled to free up space around the monument. This led to a great number of complaints from locals, starting a long series of arguments and criticisms of the Ara Pacis project. These arguments are ongoing despite the original pavilion being replaced by a new one in 2006, known as the &quot;Ara Pacis museum&quot;.

=== Museum of the Ara Pacis ===

The historic Fascist style building around the Altar, locally known as &quot;teca del Morpurgo&quot;, was pulled down in 2006, and replaced by a glass and steel structure in modern style, designed by architect Richard Meier. The new cover building, which has been named &quot;Ara Pacis museum&quot;, now stands on the same site as Mussolini&#x27;s structure. This new structure is much bigger than the previous one and it is divided into multiple rooms and sections besides the main one containing the altar.

Meier&#x27;s building construction caused new arguments and criticism, after the ones which accompanied the first building construction, both from Roman inhabitants and foreign observers, probably due both to political memory tied to the pre-existing pavilion and to the visual impact of the new pavilion, which in the opinion of many is in stark contrast with surrounding historical buildings.

Nicolai Ouroussoff, of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the building &quot;a contemporary expression of what can happen when an architect fetishizes his own style out of a sense of self-aggrandizement. Absurdly over-scale, it seems indifferent to the naked beauty of the dense and richly textured city around it.&quot; Former mayor Gianni Alemanno, backed in July 2008 by culture undersecretary Francesco Maria Giro, pledged to tear down the new structure. He later changed his stance on the building and has agreed with Mr. Meier to modifications including drastically reducing the height of the wall between an open-air space outside the museum and a busy road along the Tiber river. The city plans to build a wide pedestrian area along the river and run the road underneath it. &quot;It&#x27;s an improvement,&quot; says Meier, adding that &quot;the reason that wall was there has to do with traffic and noise. Once that is eliminated, the idea of opening the piazza to the river is a good one.&quot; The mayor&#x27;s office said Alemanno hopes to complete the project before the end of his term in 2013.

<text>The Member of the Wedding is a 1946 novel by Southern writer Carson McCullers. It took McCullers five years to complete, although she interrupted the work for a few months to write the novella &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Café&quot;.

In a letter to her husband Reeves McCullers, she explained that the novel was &quot;one of those works that the least slip can ruin. It must be beautifully done. For like a poem there is not much excuse for it otherwise.&quot;

She originally planned to write a story about a girl who is in love with her piano teacher, but she had what she called &quot;a divine spark: &quot;Suddenly I said: Frankie is in love with her brother and the bride... The illumination focused the whole book.&quot;

==Plot==
The novel takes place over a few days in late August. It tells the story of 12-year-old tomboy Frankie Addams, who feels disconnected from the world; in her words, an &quot;unjoined person.&quot; Frankie&#x27;s mother died when she was born, and her father is a distant, uncomprehending figure. Her closest companions are the family&#x27;s African American maid, Berenice Sadie Brown, and her six-year-old cousin, John Henry West. She has no friends in her small Southern town and dreams of going away with her brother and his bride-to-be on their honeymoon in the Alaskan wilderness.

The novel explores the psychology of the three main characters and is more concerned with evocative settings than with incident. Frankie does, however, have a brief and troubling encounter with a soldier. Her hopes of going away are disappointed and, her fantasy destroyed, a short coda reveals how her personality has changed. It also recounts the fate of John Henry West, and Berenice Sadie Brown&#x27;s future plans.

==Critical interpretations==

&quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; is told from the point of view of Frankie, who is a troubled adolescent. But some critics think it is a mistake to view &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; as simply a coming of age novel—a &quot;sweet momentary illumination of adolescence before the disillusion of adulthood,&quot; as it is sometimes regarded, or as Patricia Yaeger puts it, &quot;an economical way of learning about the pangs of growing up.&quot;

For Yaeger and the Scots novelist critic Ali Smith, this is to sentimentalize the work. They suggest that such a reading misses much of its profundity, darkness, and what Smith calls its &quot;political heft.&quot; It should be seen, according to Smith, as a &quot;very funny, very dark novel&quot; and a &quot;combination of hope, hopelessness and callousness.&quot; Its theme, says Smith, is &quot;why people exclude others and what happens when they do.&quot;

Other critics, including McKay Jenkins, have highlighted the importance of themes of racial and sexual identity. Frankie wishes people could &quot;change back and forth from boys to girls.&quot; John Henry wants them to be &quot;half boy and half girl.&quot; Berenice would like there to be &quot;no separate colored people in the world, but all human beings would be light brown color with blue eyes and black hair.&quot; For them, Jenkins suggests, the ideal world would be &quot;a place where identity . . . is fluid, changeable, amorphous.&quot;

Another critic, Margaret B. McDowell, has also stressed the role of Berenice Sadie Brown (and to a lesser extent John Henry West) in counter-pointing Frankie’s story.

Jack Halberstam, in his book &quot;Female Masculinity,&quot; uses the character of Frankie to illustrate the pressures on girls to &quot;outgrow&quot; their tomboyishness, arguing that masculinity is tolerated in girls only as long as they ultimately conform to gender expectations in adulthood. In the example of Frankie, he argues, we can see that &quot;the image of the tomboy can be tolerated only within a narrative of blossoming womanhood; within such a narrative, tomboyism represents a resistance to adulthood itself rather than to adult femininity.&quot;

Critics such as Elizabeth Freeman and Nicole Seymour view the novel as &quot;queer&quot;—as challenging gender and sexual norms. In her article on the novel, Seymour argues that McCullers queers the human developmental schema (childhood-adolescence-adulthood) through various narrative methods. These methods include the novel&#x27;s tripartite structure, its depiction of personal difficulties with narrativizing, and &quot;the refusal of dynamism, and the use of the literary devices of repetition and analepsis.&quot; Seymour concludes that &quot;the novel allows us to imagine an adolescent body in synchronic rather than diachronic terms—thereby challenging the ideals of sexuality, gender, and race that normally accrue to such bodies.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
The book has been adapted for the stage, motion pictures, and television.

McCullers herself adapted the novel for a Broadway production directed by Harold Clurman. It opened on January 5, 1950 at the Empire Theatre, where it ran for 501 performances. The cast included Ethel Waters, Julie Harris, and introduced Brandon deWilde, a seven-year-old second-grader at the time.

Waters, Harris, and deWilde reprised their stage roles, with Arthur Franz, Nancy Gates, and Dickie Moore joining the cast, for the 1952 film version &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot;. The screenplay was adapted by Edna and Edward Anhalt and directed by Fred Zinnemann. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for Julie Harris, in her debut screen appearance.

A stage musical version, &quot;F. Jasmine Addams&quot;, was produced Off-Broadway in 1971. Another unauthorized musical adaptation was written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane and produced by the University of Alabama at Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Town and Gown Theater&quot; in 1987.

A 1982 television adaptation, directed by Delbert Mann, starred Pearl Bailey, Dana Hill and Howard E. Rollins, Jr.

A 1989 Broadway revival production with Roundabout Theatre (directed by Harold Scott, set design by Thomas Cariello) starred Esther Rolle as Berenice, Amelia Campbell as Frankie and Calvin Lennon Armitage as young John Henry.

The 1997 film version, adapted by David W. Rintels and directed by Fielder Cook, starred Anna Paquin, Alfre Woodard, Corey Dunn and Enrico Colantoni. Rintels used the original novel rather than the play as his source material.

The Young Vic theatre in London produced the stage version of &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; in 2007, directed by Matthew Dunster. Frankie Addams was played by Flora Spencer-Longhurst and Berenice Sadie Brown by Portia, a member of Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s LAByrinth Theater Company.

== References in popular culture ==
Text from &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; was used by Jarvis Cocker on his debut album, &quot;Jarvis&quot;. It forms the introduction to the 11th song on the album, &quot;Big Julie&quot;, and consists of his re-writing of the opening lines of the book. In the original these are:
It happened that green and crazy summer when Frankie was twelve years old. This was the summer when for a long time she had not been a member. She belonged to no club and was a member of nothing in the world. Frankie had become an unjoined person who hung around in doorways, and she was afraid.

The poet Sylvia Plath was known to admire McCullers&#x27; work, and the unusual phrase &quot;silver and exact&quot;, used by McCullers to describe a set of train tracks in the novel, is the first line of Plath&#x27;s poem &quot;Mirror&quot;.

<doc id="187115" wikidata="Q3548988" url="?curid=187115" title="With a Song in My Heart (film)">
<text>With a Song in My Heart is a 1952 American biographical musical drama film that tells the story of actress and singer Jane Froman, who was crippled by an airplane crash on February 22, 1943, when the Boeing 314 Pan American Clipper flying boat she was on suffered a crash landing in the Tagus River near Lisbon, Portugal. She entertained the troops in World War II despite having to walk with crutches. The film stars Susan Hayward, Rory Calhoun, David Wayne, Thelma Ritter, Robert Wagner, Helen Westcott, and Una Merkel. Froman herself supplied Hayward&#x27;s singing voice.

The film was written and produced by Lamar Trotti and directed by Walter Lang. The title song, &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; (Rodgers and Hart, 1929), became famous in the United Kingdom as the theme to the long-running BBC radio show &quot;Family Favourites&quot;.

==Plot==
Jane Froman (Susan Hayward) is a humble staff singer at a Cincinnati radio station, but in no time she rises to the uppermost rungs of network radio fame. Jane gratefully marries her agent Don Ross (David Wayne), but soon both realize they&#x27;re not truly in love. Jane&#x27;s popularity soars, and she leaves on a European tour. When her plane crashes, she is partially crippled. Unable to walk without crutches, she nonetheless goes on to entertain U.S. troops during World War II.

==Cast==
* Susan Hayward as Jane Froman
* Rory Calhoun as John Burn
* David Wayne as Don Ross
* Thelma Ritter as Clancy
* Robert Wagner as GI paratrooper
* Helen Westcott as Jennifer March
* Una Merkel as Sister Marie
* Richard Allan as dancer / tenor
* Max Showalter as Harry Guild
* Ed Oliver as bandleader

Singing groups the Four Girl Friends, the Modernaires, the Melody Men, the Skylarks, and the Starlighters appear in the film.

==Production==
The rights to Jane Froman&#x27;s life story were sought by a variety of production companies, including MGM, Warner Bros, Sam Goldwyn, 20th Century Fox, and Wald-Krasna (at RKO). In September 1950 Fox announced that Lamar Trotti would write and produce &quot;The Jane Froman Story&quot;. Froman says she decided to go with Fox after talking to Trotti even though MGM offered $25,000 more. She says the price paid was &quot;mid six figures&quot;.

In March 1951 Fox announced that the male leads would be played by David Wayne and Dale Robertson and that the film would be called &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot;. In April 1951, Jean Peters was announced as the star. In May, the lead went to Susan Hayward.

The title was changed to &quot;You, the Night and the Music&quot;. Rory Calhoun replaced Robertson in June.

In July 1951 Robert Wagner was added to the cast.

Joyce MacKenzie was cast as the woman (in reality singer and actress Tamara Drasin, who died in the crash) who took Froman&#x27;s seat.

Froman acted as technical adviser, but refused to watch the sequence involving the airplane crash.

==Soundtrack recording==
As per the times, the soundtrack album for &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; was a studio recording, and it initially included eight songs and a shorter version of the &quot;American Medley&quot; sung by Jane Froman, with a short orchestral introduction by George Greeley, who conducted the orchestra and chorus. The Capitol Records album was released in multiple formats: Capitol L-309 (LP), DDN-309 (4 record 78rpm-Box Set); KDF-309 (4 record 45rpm singles Box-Set); and FBF-309 (2 EP Box-set). This album was the best-selling album of 1952 and spent 25 weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Jane Froman also released a single of the title song with Capitol Records.

==Reception==
The film was a box office success. Wagner&#x27;s small role received a lot of acclaim, resulting in 3,000 fan letters a week arriving at the studio – this encouraged Fox to build him up as a star.

==Accolades==
==Soundtrack songs from the film==
Although the film won the Academy Award for the Best Original Score, there were a number of American standards represented. All except three songs featured the voice of Jane Froman, and were performed by Susan Hayward.

<text>Hanno (; c. 1510 – 8 June 1516) was the pet white elephant given by King Manuel I of Portugal to Pope Leo X (born Giovanni de&#x27; Medici) at his coronation. He was named Annon and Hanno after the Malayalam word Aana (ആന) meaning elephant. Hanno, an Asian elephant, came to Rome in 1514 with the Portuguese ambassador Tristão da Cunha and quickly became the Pope&#x27;s favorite animal. Hanno died two years later from complications of a treatment for constipation with gold-enriched laxative.

==Background==
King Manuel had either received him as a gift from the Raja of Cochin, or had asked Afonso de Albuquerque, his viceroy in India, to purchase him. Hanno was said to be white in colour, and arrived by ship from Lisbon to Rome in 1514, aged about four years, and was kept initially in an enclosure in the Belvedere courtyard, then moved to a specially constructed building between St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and the Apostolic Palace, near the Borgo Sant&#x27;Angelo (a road in the rione of Borgo). His arrival was commemorated in poetry and art. Pasquale Malaspina wrote:

Hanno became a great favourite of the papal court and was featured in processions. Two years after he came to Rome, he fell ill suddenly, was given a purgative, and died on 8 June 1516, with the pope at his side. Hanno was interred in the Cortile del Belvedere at the age of seven.

The artist Raphael designed a memorial fresco (which does not survive), and the Pope himself composed the epitaph:

Hanno was also the subject of a satirical pamphlet by Pietro Aretino titled &quot;The Last Will and Testament of the Elephant Hanno.&quot; The fictitious will cleverly mocked the leading political and religious figures of Rome at the time, including Pope Leo X himself. The pamphlet was such a success that it kickstarted Aretino&#x27;s career and established him as a famous satirist, ultimately known as &quot;the Scourge of Princes&quot;.

There are four sketches of Hanno, done in life with red chalk, in the collection of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.

==In popular culture==
Hanno&#x27;s story is told at length in Silvio Bedini&#x27;s book, &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Elephant&quot;. According to Robert Greene, Aretino&#x27;s audacious satire catapulted him to fame and, such was Leo&#x27;s amusement, earned him a post in the papal service.

The Malayalam novel &quot;Aano&quot; Written by G. R. Indugopan is the story of this elephant and its mahout who travelled in Europe as their perspective

<text>Lüneburg Heath (, ) is a large area of heath, geest, and woodland in the northeastern part of the state of Lower Saxony in northern Germany. It forms part of the hinterland for the cities of Hamburg, Hanover and Bremen and is named after the town of Lüneburg. Most of the area is a nature reserve. Northern Low Saxon is still widely spoken in the region.

Lüneburg Heath has extensive areas, and the most yellow of heathland, typical of those that covered most of the North German countryside until about 1800, but which have almost completely disappeared in other areas. The heaths were formed after the Neolithic period by overgrazing of the once widespread forests on the poor sandy soils of the geest, as this slightly hilly and sandy terrain in northern Europe is called. Lüneburg Heath is therefore a historic cultural landscape. The remaining areas of heath are kept clear mainly through grazing, especially by a North German breed of moorland sheep called the Heidschnucke. Due to its unique landscape, Lüneburg Heath is a popular tourist destination in North Germany.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

From a geographical point of view, Lüneburg Heath is a specific natural region, that is an area distinguished by a specific combination of abiotic factors (climate, relief, water resources, soil, geology) and biotic factors (flora and fauna). Lüneburg Heath is a sub-division of the North European Plain. In the list of the major natural regions of Germany issued by the Federal Office for Nature Conservation (&quot;Bundesamt für Naturschutz&quot;) it is region number D28.

Lüneburg Heath covers an area which includes the districts (Landkreise) of Celle, Gifhorn, Heidekreis, Uelzen, Lüneburg, Lüchow-Dannenberg, southeast Rotenburg (the town of Visselhövede, Fintel, part of the municipality of Scheeßel and the eastern half of Bothel) and the rural district of Harburg. The easternmost fringes of the Stade Geest belonging to Landkreis Verden are called the Linteln Geest (&quot;Lintelner Geest&quot;) or Verden Heath (&quot;Verdener Heide&quot;) and form part of the municipality of Kirchlinteln. This region has no sharply defined boundary with the Lüneburg Heath.

Lüneburg Heath lies between the rivers Elbe to the north, the Drawehn to the east, the Aller to the south and southwest, the middle course of the Wümme to the west and the Harburg Hills (&quot;Harburger Berge&quot;) to the northwest.

On the northwestern edge of Lüneburg Heath are the Harburg Hills and south of Schneverdingen there are bogs, such as the Pietzmoor. Also of note are other smaller bogs in sinkholes, like the Grundloses Moor (&quot;bottomless bog&quot;) near Walsrode or the Bullenkuhle near Bokel (part of Sprakensehl). The eastern boundary to the Wendland is formed by the Göhrde-Drawehn Hills (the Ostheide natural region). Parts of Lüneburg Heath are in the &quot;Südheide Nature Park&quot;, others in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Park.

=== Hills and elevations ===

The highest elevation on Lüneburg Heath is the Wilseder Berg () above NN). Other hills over high are: Falkenberg (), near Bergen, Ahrberg (), Hakenberg (), Hoher Mechtin (), Pampower Berg (), Lüßberg (), Brunsberg, near Sprötze (), Goldbockenberg (), Hingstberg (), Staffelberg (), Hengstberg (), Höpenberg near Schneverdingen (), Haußelberg (), Breithorn (), Mützenberg (), Tellmer Berg (), Wümmeberg (), Schiffberg (), Hummelsberg and Wulfsberg (each ), Drullberg and Thonhopsberg (each ), Kruckberg and Wietzer Berg (each ) and Höllenberg ().

Several of these hills - the Wilseder Berg, the Falkenberg, the Haußelberg and the Breithorn - were used by the mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss, as triangulation stations in his topographical surveys of the Kingdom of Hanover from 1821 to 1825.

=== Rivers and streams ===
Rivers in the area, beside the numerous small heathland streams, include the Wümme, which rises on the western slopes of the Wilseder Berg, in the south the Lachte with its tributary the Lutter, and the Aller, the Vissel, the Böhme, the Grindau, the Meiße and the Örtze. They all belong to the Weser river system. Those flowing into the Elbe are the Aue, the Ilmenau, the Luhe and the Seeve.

=== Geology ===

The immediate subsurface layers on Lüneburg Heath are almost exclusively made up of deposits from the quaternary ice age. The landscape consists of flat plains of ground moraines, ridges of hilly terminal moraines and also of sandar - glacial outwash plains deposited at the edge of the ice sheet.

During the Saalian Stage (230,000–130,000 years ago) the area of the present-day Lüneburg Heath was covered three times by a continental ice sheet. In the last glacial period (110,000–10,000 years ago) the ice sheet no longer covered the Lüneburg Heath area; it reached only as far as the River Elbe. Due to the lack of vegetation, the much more rugged terrain at that time was heavily eroded by water, wind and by soil fluction; this resulted in valleys like the Totengrund. The material displaced by erosion, referred to as sediment (&quot;Geschiebedecksand&quot;), has a depth of 0.4 to 0.8 metres (on slopes up to 1.5 metres).

The region is mostly covered by a heathland landscape consisting of big heather and juniper areas, forests and some smaller swamps. In contrast to the areas in the north of Lüneburg Heath, the landscape is very hilly, as it is placed on a terminal moraine.

=== Natural divisions ===
Lüneburg Heath is divided into the following natural sub-divisions:
* Hohe Heide
:The Hohe Heide (&quot;High Heath&quot;) consists of a series of end moraines from the glaciers of the Saalian glaciation (230,000–130,000 years ago) with the Wilseder Berg at its heart. Unlike the other natural divisions of Lüneburg Heath, the terrain is quite rugged. Characteristic of the area are dry hilltops, periglacial dry valleys and hollows like the Totengrund. Heathland dominates the landscape. They are part of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Park and of great importance for tourism. In addition there are also extensive pine forests.
* South Heath
:The South Heath (&quot;Südheide&quot;) is dominated by expanses of gently undulating, hilly Sander plains, and sheets of ground moraine and the remains of end moraines from earlier ice ages. There are still large areas of heath on the military training areas near Bad Fallingbostel and Munster (Örtze); these are out-of-bounds to visitors however. The Osterheide near Schneverdingen also belongs to this natural subdivision. It is part of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve. Near Schneverdingen and south of Soltau there are several bogs. A large area of the Südheide is covered by pine forests.
* Ostheide
:Numerous end moraines run through the Ostheide (&quot;East Heath&quot;) which stretches on the eastern edge of Lüneburg Heath from Lüneburg to north of Wolfsburg. In parts of this region the land is intensively cultivated. The northern area, the so-called Göhrde and the Drawehn, are by contrast mostly wooded like the southern ridge of end moraine.
* Uelzen Basin and Ilmenau depression
:The ground moraine landscape of the Uelzen Basin is predominantly used for agriculture. On the surrounding ridges there are also a few pine forests however. There are still large areas of heath here as well, for example the &quot;Ellerndorfer Heide&quot; (&quot;Ellerndorf Heath&quot;) in western Uelzen district or the &quot;Klein Bünstorfer Heide&quot; (&quot;Klein Bünstorf Heath&quot;).
* Luheheide
:The ridges of end moraine on the Luheheide have clearly defined slopes that fall away sharply to the Elbe Valley. The heath is deeply incised by all the rivers that drain northwards to the Elbe; rivers such as the Seeve, Aue, Luhe (Ilmenau). The ridges between them are wooded and sparsely populated. Settlements are crowded together in the valleys. There is hardly any heathland left in this area, it has been largely reforested by pines.
=== Climate ===
Lüneburg Heath lies in a temperate maritime climatic region moderated by the Atlantic, with mild winters, cool summers and precipitation all-year round. The Hohe Heide, however, has a &quot;low mountain climate&quot; with lower temperatures and higher precipitation than in the surrounding area.

== Nature ==
=== Nature parks and nature reserves ===
In the northwestern part of Lüneburg Heath is the Lüneburg Heath Nature Park which covers an area of . At its heart, around the Wilseder Berg, is the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve (&quot;Naturschutzgebiet&quot; or NSG) founded as long ago as 1921 with of land which is roughly 58% woods and 20% heathland. Other nature parks in the Lüneburg Heath region are the Südheide Nature Park and Elbufer-Drawehn Nature Park. Right in the north of the area is the Harburg Hills Nature Park. The Lüneburg Heath NSG, together with the open heathland of the huge Munster Nord and Süd training areas and the Bergen-Hohne Training Area, is the largest single area of heathland in Central Europe. And within the former province (&quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot;) of Lüneburg there are no less than 212 individual nature reserves (as at 31 December 2006).

=== Formation of the heath landscape ===

After the end of the Weichselian Ice Age (115,000 to 10,000 years ago) the first woods appeared in the area that now forms Lüneburg Heath which, following the natural ecological succession and encouraged by a gradual improvement in the climate, progressed from birch and pine forest through hazel woods to light woods of sessile oaks.

The heath and its surrounding area belong to those regions of the North German Plain in which the hunter culture of the Mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by Neolithic farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the Neolithic, large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of geest on Lüneburg Heath. This was a result of the intensive grazing of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the common heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless, oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over a long period of time the region of Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the migration period, the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.
Not until after 1000 AD does the pollen analysis show a continuous reduction in the woodlands and a considerable increase in heather. This was brought about by a change from nomadic farming to settled farming with permanent settlements. The typical heath farming economy emerged: due to the poor soils the few available nutrients from a large area were concentrated on relatively small fields, from which grain, in particular, could be produced. This was achieved by the regular removal of the turf (a method known as Plaggen), which was used as hay for the pens of the moorland sheep, the Heidschnucken. This was then enriched with the manure and urine of the sheep – and spread over the fields as fertiliser.

By cutting the turf the regenerative capacity of the soils was exhausted. The regular removal of the top layer of soil contributed to the spreading of heathland. As heather decomposes, the pH value of the soil falls drastically, as far as the iron buffer-region at pH 3, which initiates the process of podsolisation. Soil life is severely damaged, which results in a hard layer of earth underneath the root zone on the heath at a depth of about . The iron and humus particles released by the topsoil precipitate onto this impervious hardpan. The subsoil thus separates itself from the topsoil. The nutrients are largely washed out of the topsoil which leads to leaching and causes the typical grey-white coloration of the paths on the heath.

The oft-expressed view in the literature that the heath arose in the Middle Ages as a result of the demand for wood by the Lüneburg salt pans is incorrect. The Lüneburg salt ponds certainly needed firewood for the production of salt, but they did not appear until around 1000 AD, by which time the heath had already been around for 4,000 years. The amount required, even in the heyday of production, could have been continuously supplied by an area of woodland about 50 km2 in area, yet the heath covers over 7000 km2. In any case the wood certainly did not come from the heath, but via the waterways, especially from Mecklenburg up the Elbe and from the area of the Schaalsee. Transportation overland would have been far too expensive (apart from the River Ilmenau which was navigable at the time, no rivers flow from the main areas of heathland to Lüneburg), as can be seen not only from some of the delivery notes which still survive, but also from the fact that there are still large woods around Lüneburg itself, such as the Göhrde. Finally heathland has frequently developed in areas where there are no salt pans, such as the sheep-grazing regions on the coasts of Norway to Portugal and in Scotland and Ireland.

The heath is not therefore a natural landscape, but a cultural landscape created by the intervention of man. In order to prevent its semi-open heathland from being repopulated by trees, especially pines and, to a lesser extent, silver birches, which would cause the loss of this millennia-old environment and its many inhabitants, including often very rare animal and plant species, sheep are allowed to graze it regularly; these are almost exclusively the local German moorland sheep, the Heidschnucke.

=== Plant population/Phytocenosis ===
In the 20th century, numerous conservation measures were implemented on Lüneburg Heath; as a result, it is one of the best researched regions of central Europe.

==== Heathland ====
Sand heaths form about 20% of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve and may be broken down into further sub-divisions, the most important being:

;Ordinary sand heath (&quot;Typische Sandheide&quot;, Genisto-Callunetum)
*In addition to the common heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;) only a few taller plants occur here, none of which can be classed as characteristic species. Amongst them are the wavy hair-grass (&quot;Deschampsia flexuosa&quot;) and common juniper (&quot;Juniperus communis&quot;). Ordinary sand heath is the most widespread of the heathland types. Its proportion has increased in recent decades at the expense of other heath habitats. This reduction in the variety of heathland types may be due to increasing nitrogen levels from the air, the increase in plant litter (&quot;Rohhumusauflagen&quot;) and the natural ageing of the heathland.

;Lichen-rich sand heath (&quot;Flechtenreiche Sandheide&quot;, Genisto-Callunetum cladonietosum)
*The lichen-rich sand heaths can be told apart from the other types of heathland by the presence of various cup lichens (&quot;Cladonia&quot;), ciliated fringewort (&quot;Ptilidium ciliare&quot;) and juniper haircap (&quot;Polytrichum juniperinum&quot;). They occur frequently on dry, south-facing slopes. This type of heath is found west of Niederhaverbeck and near Sundermühlen.

;Clay heath (&quot;Lehmheide&quot;, Genisto-callunetum danthonietusum)
*This can be identified by the presence of heath grass (&quot;Danthonia decumbens&quot;), pill sedge (&quot;Carex pilulifera&quot;), mat grass (&quot;Nardus stricta&quot;), fine-leaved sheep&#x27;s-fescue (&quot;Festuca filiformis&quot;), mouse-ear hawkweed (&quot;Hieracium pilosella&quot;) and field wood-rush (&quot;Luzula campestris&quot;). Clay heaths have become very rare within the Lüneburg Heath. They are found on the Wilseder Berg and south of Niederhaverbeck.

;Blueberry sand heath (&quot;Heidelbeer-Sandheide&quot;, Genisto-Callunetum, Vaccinium myrtillus Rasse)
*Blueberries (&quot;Vaccinium myrtillus&quot;) are the signature species of this type of heath and, more rarely, cranberries (&quot;Vaccinium vitis-idaea&quot;). Blueberry heath is the second most common type of vegetation on the heathlands and occurs especially on northern slopes, the edges of woods and thick juniper hedges. This type of heath is particularly characteristic of the northern slopes of the Wilseder Berg, as well as the Steingrund and Totengrund. In those places, cranberries have even ousted the common heather (&quot;Calluna vulgaris&quot;) in places.

;Wet sand heath (&quot;Feuchte Sandheide&quot;, Genisto-Callunetum, Molinia-Variante)
*Wet sand heath is the ideal habitat for purple moor grass (&quot;Molinia caerulea&quot;), cross-leaved heath (&quot;Erica tetralix&quot;) and scirpus (&quot;Scirpus cespitosus&quot;). It occurs in places close to the water table and in the transition zone around bogs. Its primary locations are areas north of Wilsede and near the Hörpel Ponds (&quot;Hörpeler Teichen&quot;).

==== Woods ====

The greater part (about 58%) of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve consists of woods, primarily pine forests, which were planted in the second half of the 19th century on former heathland and drifting sand. In some cases the dunes simply became naturally overgrown, again with pines. There are only a very few old stands of sessile oaks, which stem from the logging industry during the time of the Kingdom of Hanover. In many parts of the nature reserve there are so-called &quot;Stühbüsche&quot; (a form of coppice), trees that were coppiced by repeatedly being cut short. In the meantime they have grown wild again and have a characteristic and unusual appearance with their multiple trunks. Near Wilsede there is the remnant of a Hutewald, a wood pasture with giant, multi-stemmed beech trees.

==== Bogs ====
The largest bog on Lüneburg Heath is the Pietzmoor, which lies east of Schneverdingen. It was drained however and peat was cut there until the 1960s. The Nature Park Association carried out work in the 1980s to try to turn it back to its natural waterlogged state. For example, some of the drainage ditches were filled which led to a considerable rise in the water levels of the former peat cuts. However typical bog vegetation has not yet re-established itself.

=== Animals ===
Many species of animal live on Lüneburg Heath, particularly birds that are at home in the wide, open landscape, some of which are seriously threatened by the intensive-farming techniques in other areas. These include the: black grouse (&quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;), the nightjar (&quot;Caprimulgus europaeus&quot;), the woodlark (&quot;Lullula arborea&quot;), the great grey shrike (&quot;Lanius excubitor&quot;), the red-backed shrike (&quot;Lanius collurio&quot;), the northern wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot;), the wryneck (&quot;Jynx torquilla&quot;), the European green woodpecker (&quot;Picus viridis&quot;), the stonechat (&quot;Saxicola torquata&quot;), the Eurasian curlew (&quot;Numenius arquata&quot;), the common quail (&quot;Coturnix coturnix&quot;) and the black stork (&quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;). In the Lüneburg Heath, the population of the very rare black grouse is rising continually. In 2007, 78 were counted, 13 more than in the previous year. Since 2003, the number of grouse has doubled.

Wolves, although once extinct in the area, have returned to the Lüneburg Heath.

Numerous species including European bison, moose and brown bear which once inhabited the region may be seen in the Lüneburg Heath Wildlife Park alongside more exotic animals like snow leopards and Arctic wolves.

== Culture and history ==

=== Early history ===
Pollen analyses show that the dry geest soils of North Germany have been cultivated since about 3000 BC. Clearance by fire and the cultivation of crops on the Pleistocene sandy soils quickly led however to soil degradation. So the land cleared by fire could only be used for a short time. The settlements moved frequently and woods elsewhere were cleared. Even at that time the first Calluna (heather) heaths appeared. Evidence of relatively dense settlement is found especially in Uelzen district. On Lüneburg Heath there are numerous Megalithic sites and tumuli from the Neolithic and the early Bronze Age. The most famous are the &quot;Oldendorfer Totenstatt&quot; (Oldendorf Grave site) and the &quot;Sieben Steinhäuser&quot; (Seven Stone Houses). But even in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve there are more than a thousand tumuli, especially near Nieder- and Oberhaverbeck. The largest of these tumuli is the so-called Prince&#x27;s Grave (&quot;Fürstengrab&quot;). Also near Wilsede there is the well-known stone and juniper group known as Hannibal&#x27;s Grave (&quot;Hannibals Grab&quot;).

=== Transition to settlement culture ===
After the withdrawal of the Lombards in the migration period, from about 700 AD Lüneburg Heath belonged to the Duchy of Saxony, which was conquered by Charlemagne in the 9th century and became part of the Frankish Empire. The resulting close control of the population and the Christianization meant that the rural settlements had to stay in one place and could no longer move about freely. The land had to be farmed more intensively which led to the heathland spreading.

=== Settlements ===

Lüneburg Heath was always relatively sparsely populated due to the poor soils in the area. The region was dominated by heath farming which was a less intensive form of land usage necessary for its large areas of barren terrain and heathland. An important economic sideline of past centuries was heathland beekeeping. The villages were usually encircled by small tracts of woodland, sometimes interrupted by fields or meadows, and merged without clear boundaries into the surrounding landscape. The farmsteads were arranged relatively arbitrarily, many stood very close to one another; others were spread out at some distance from each other. They were loose cluster villages (&quot;lockere Haufendörfer&quot;). In order to prevent cattle trampling flat the gardens attached to the houses, village roads were enclosed with wooden fences and, later, with characteristic stone walls. The typical design of farmhouse was the &quot;Fachhallenhaus&quot;, a large timber-framed single building, in which people and animals lived under a single roof. Each village had relatively few complete farms; in Wilsede there were only four, in the church village (Kirchdorf) of Undeloh there were eleven, but that was an exception. In addition there were Koten (small, single houses), sheep pens and shared bakehouses. The farms themselves, however, were very large. In Wilsede all the features of a heath village described here may still be seen. Wilsede Heath Museum (Heidemuseum Wilsede) was established in a &quot;Fachhallenhaus&quot; and it gives an insight into the working and living conditions of a heathland farm around 1850. Walsrode Heath Museum was one of the first German open air museums and also portrays the life of heathland folk. In rural parts of the region they still sometimes use today a Low German dialect called &quot;Heidjerisch&quot;. This word derives from the name given to inhabitants of the Lüneburg Heath – the &quot;Heidjer&quot;.

=== Heath convents ===
In the Lüneburg Heath region, six nunneries from the Middle Ages survived, which became Protestant convents after the Reformation. These establishments are the abbeys of: Ebstorf, Isenhagen, Lüne, Medingen, Wienhausen and Walsrode.

=== The end of heathland farming in the 19th century ===

From 1831 feudalism was abolished in the Kingdom of Hanover and those heathland areas that were common land for the villages were divided amongst the individual farmers. Heathland farming died out at the end of the 19th century. Many farmers sold their land to the Prussian treasury or the Hanover monastic chamber, who afforested the land with pines. As a result, the area of heath was drastically reduced. In the late 19th century a number of farmers from the area were encouraged by British authorities to settle in the Philippi area of Cape Town, South Africa due to their knowledge of farming in barren sandy soils.

In 1800, large parts of Northwest Germany had been covered with heaths and bog. Today, by contrast the only large, continuous areas of heath remaining are in the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve and on a few military training areas.

=== The changing perception of the heath ===

As late as the turn of the 18th to the 19th century, the barren and almost treeless heathlands were still perceived as hostile and threatening environments, as evinced by two travel logs of journeys between 1799 and 1804:
:::— Charles Gottlob Küttner: &quot;Travels through Denmark, Sweden, Austria and part of Italy, in 1798 &amp; 1799&quot;. London 1805.
:::— Michel Ange Mangourit: &quot;Travels in Hanover, during the years 1803 and 1804&quot;. London 1806.

The poem &quot;Der Heideknabe&quot; (&quot;The Heath Lad&quot;) from the year 1844 by Friedrich Hebbel stresses the unearthly atmosphere and the bleak solitude of the heaths:

Towards the middle of the 19th century the first positive descriptions of the heath emerged, initially inspired by the romantic movement. With the Industrial Revolution in Germany, unspoilt nature became more important for people, providing a welcome contrast with the rapidly burgeoning cities. Because the heathlands of North Germany were being increasingly decimated by cultivation and reforestation, they now appeared to be worth protecting. Numerous writers and painters portrayed the beauty of the heath, particularly when it was in bloom in August and September. One important heathland artist was Eugen Bracht. The most famous heath poet was the local writer Hermann Löns (1866–1914), who spent some time living in a hunting lodge near Westenholz. He worked the heath countryside into his books and promoted the foundation of the first German nature reserve on Lüneburg Heath. His purported remains were buried in a juniper copse at Tietlingen near Walsrode in 1935. His works were a source for Heimatfilme that were shot on Lüneburg Heath, such as &quot;Grün ist die Heide&quot; (&quot;The Heath Is Green&quot;) from 1932 and remade in 1951 and 1972, as well as &quot;Rot ist die Liebe&quot; (&quot;Red is Love&quot;) from 1956.

=== History of conservation on Lüneburg Heath ===
Around 1900, there were growing demands to save the heathland and bogs of northwest Germany, which were threatened by reforestation and drainage. On Lüneburg Heath, Wilhelm Bode, then the pastor at Egestorf, was particularly active in pressing for the preservation of the endangered countryside. He had learned in 1905 of plans for building weekend houses on the Totengrund. In order to prevent this, he persuaded Andreas Thomsen, a professor from Münster, to acquire the area as a nature reserve. In 1909, Pastor Bode and district administrator (&quot;Landrat&quot;) Fritz Ecker prevented the planned reforestation of the Wilseder Berg.
In the same year, an appeal by Curt Floerike appeared in Kosmos magazine, citing the establishment of national parks in the United States and calling for them in Germany. In order to realise this goal, the Nature Park Society or Verein Naturschutzpark (VNP) was founded in Munich on 23 October 1909. They planned to create national parks in the Alps, the Central Uplands and in the north German geest region. By 1913, the society had 13,000 members.

The area of Lüneburg Heath near Wilsede was selected as the location for the north German national park. Using the VNP&#x27;s funds, more than 30 km2 of heathland were purchased or rented by 1913. In 1921, a police ordinance placed more than 200 km2 of Lüneburg Heath under protection, the first time this had been achieved in Germany. One problem that arose as early as the 1920s was the steadily increasing number of visitors. In 1924, in order to keep visitors away from sensitive areas of heathland, a volunteer Heath Guard (&quot;Heidewacht&quot;) was founded.

The Reich conservation law was passed in 1933 and Lüneburg Heath was designated as an official nature reserve. Although plans to build a motorway through the park and for the heath to be used as a military training area were stopped, in 1933 the &quot;Heidewacht&quot; was disbanded, mainly because it was made up of members of social democratic youth organisations. In 1939, a new law that granted the chairman of the VNP – now called Führer – wide-ranging powers. Jews could no longer be members of the society.
Between 1891 and the Second World War, large military training areas were established on Lüneburg Heath, including the largest one in Europe, the Bergen-Hohne Training Area on the &quot;Südheide&quot;. Here the heathland has largely been preserved, albeit no longer accessible to the general public.

A large area of the nature park belonging to the society near Schneverdingen was taken over by the British Army of the Rhine in 1945 for use as a tank training area. In the 1950s, during military exercises, British tanks even pushed forward as far as the Wilseder Berg. Not until the Soltau-Lüneburg Agreement, was signed in 1959 between the Federal Republic of Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada, were the boundaries of the tank training area fixed. Continual exercising over the area by armoured vehicles completely destroyed the vegetation on the Osterheide near Schneverdingen, forming large areas of sand dunes. In 1994, the British returned the so-called &quot;Red Areas&quot; of the Soltau-Lüneburg Training Area to the Nature Park Society who, with the help of money from the federal government, set about the work of renaturation. Nowadays hardly any traces of the tank training area are left. The base camp for military exercises, Reinsehlen Camp, has been turned into a nature reserve.

=== Forest fire ===
In August 1975, fire broke out on the &quot;Südheide&quot; which turned out to be the biggest forest fire in West Germany to that date.
Serious forest fires broke out in the southern part of the area near Stüde, Neudorf-Platendorf, Meinersen and then by Eschede near Celle, with devastating effects and fatalities.

== German surrender at the end of the Second World War ==

On 4 May 1945, the heath was the scene of the unconditional surrender to the Allies, under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, of German forces in the Netherlands, north-west Germany, including all islands, Denmark, and all naval ships in those areas, at the end of World War II in Europe. It is also the area where the body of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS in Nazi Germany, was secretly buried in an unmarked grave, following his suicide after capture.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Three motorways (Autobahnen) run across Lüneburg Heath, the A 7, A 27 and A 250, as well as various federal roads, the B 3, B 71, B 440 and others.

=== Railways ===
Lüneburg Heath is served by the following railway lines:
* The Hanover–Hamburg railway: Hamburg–Lüneburg–Uelzen–Celle–Hanover
* The &quot;Rollbahn&quot;: Hamburg–Buchholz in der Nordheide–Rotenburg (Wümme)–Bremen
* The Heath Railway (&quot;Heidebahn&quot;): (Hamburg)–Buchholz in der Nordheide–Soltau–Bad Fallingbostel–Walsrode–Bennemühlen–Hanover
* The Uelzen–Langwedel railway: Bremen–Visselhövede–Soltau–Munster–Uelzen
* The Brunswick–Uelzen railway: Uelzen–Wieren–Wittingen–Gifhorn–Braunschweig
* The East Hanoverian Railways (&quot;Osthannoversche Eisenbahnen&quot; or &quot;OHE&quot;) maintains a railway network, the greater part of which lies in the Lüneburg Heath (only for goods and museum services) and sometimes the Heath Express (&quot;Heide-Express&quot;).

== Important towns ==
* Amelinghausen
* Bad Fallingbostel
* Bispingen
* Buchholz in der Nordheide
* Celle
* Gifhorn
* Hermannsburg
* Lüneburg
* Munster
* Schneverdingen
* Soltau
* Uelzen
* Walsrode

== Tourism ==
Today the area is a popular tourist destination. Contributing to this are the theme park, &quot;Heidepark Soltau&quot;, the Walsrode Bird Park, the Serengeti Safari Park at Hodenhagen, Snow Dome Bispingen, and a Center Parc as well as the many farms offering holiday stays, making the Lüneburg Heath especially popular for families. Another group of tourists are the elderly on free guided bus tours (&quot;Kaffeefahrten&quot;), stopping for coffee and wool plaids at a farm before touring Lüneburg for an hour.

&quot;Kunststätte Bossard&quot; in the &quot;Nordheide&quot; near Jesteburg is an expressionist &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; open to the public.

The memorial/exhibition at the former Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near the town of Bergen is also located in the Lüneburg Heath.

<text>The presence of elephants in Europe in historical times back to classical antiquity, but previously, during Pleistocene and before, relatives of elephants were spread across the globe, including Europe. Mammoths (which are a kind of elephant) arrived in Europe during the Pliocene, around 3.2 million years ago. The large straight-tusked elephant arrived in Europe around 800-700,000 years ago, reaching a widespread distribution across the continent during warm interglacial periods. Both mammoths and the straight-tusked elephant underwent speciation into several varieties of dwarf elephants on Mediterranean islands. Mammoths, straight-tusked elephants and their dwarf descendants became extinct in Europe around 50-10,000 years ago as part of the Late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions (though some authors have argued that the dwarf elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon tiliensis&quot; may have survived until 1500 BC). Subsequently the presence of actual elephants in Europe was only due to importation of these animals.

== Overview ==

Europeans came in contact with live elephants in 327 BC, when Alexander the Great descended into India from the Hindu Kush, but Alexander was quick to adopt them. Four elephants guarded his tent, and shortly after his death his associate Ptolemy issued coins showing Alexander in the elephant headdress that became a royal emblem also in the Hellenized East. Aristotle depended on first-hand information for his account of elephants, but like most Westerners he believed the animals live for two hundred years. Roman scouts in the royal Syrian parks shortly before the last of the Seleucids fell to Rome had orders to hamstring every elephant they could capture, and while elephants performed in the circuses of Rome, Shapur&#x27;s war elephants in the mid-4th century numbered in the hundreds (Fox 1973 p 338).

Elephants largely disappeared from Europe after the Roman Empire. As exotic and expensive animals, they were exchanged as presents between European rulers, who exhibited them as luxury pets, beginning with Harun ar-Rashid&#x27;s gift of an elephant to Charlemagne.
== Examples ==
Historical accounts of elephants in Europe include:

* The 20 elephants in the army of Pyrrhus of Epirus, which landed at Tarentum in 280 BC for the first Battle of Heraclea, recorded by Plutarch&#x27;s (in &quot;Lives&quot;), Polybius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Livy. &quot;The most notable elephant in Greek history, called Victor, had long served in Pyrrhus&#x27;s army, but on seeing its mahout dead before the city walls, it rushed to retrieve him: hoisting him defiantly on his tusks, it took wild and indiscriminate revenge for the man it loved, trampling more of its supporters than its enemies&quot;. Coins of Tarentum after this battle also featured elephants.
* The 37 elephants in Hannibal&#x27;s army that crossed the Rhône in October/November 218 BC during the Second Punic War, recorded by Livy.
* The first historically recorded elephant in northern Europe was brought by emperor Claudius during the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 to the British capital of Colchester. At least one skeleton with flint weapons that has been found in England was initially misidentified as this elephant, but later dating proved it to be a mammoth skeleton from the Stone Age.
* Abul-Abbas, the Asian elephant which Harun ar-Rashid gave to Charlemagne in 797 or 802. The animal died in 810, of pneumonia.
* The &quot;Annals of Innisfallen&quot; record that King Edgar of Scotland gave a large, exotic animal to Muirchertach Ua Briain in 1105, possibly an elephant but more probably a camel. (&quot;Annals of Innisfallen&quot;, s.a. 1105; A. A. M. Duncan, &quot;Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom&quot; (1975), p. 128)
*The Cremona elephant presented to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor by Al-Kamil in 1229.
* The elephant given by Louis IX of France to Henry III of England, for his menagerie in the Tower of London in 1255 (see: Sandwich, Kent). Drawn from life by the historian Matthew Paris for his &quot;Chronica Majora&quot;, it was the first elephant to be seen in England since Claudius&#x27; war elephant. Matthew Paris&#x27; original drawing appears in his bestiary, on display in the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. The bestiary explains that while in residence at the Tower of London, the elephant enjoyed a diet of prime cuts of beef and expensive red wine, and is claimed to have died in 1257 from drinking too much wine. The accompanying text reveals that at the time, Europeans believed that elephants did not have knees and so were unable to get up if they fell over (the bestiary contains a drawing depicting an elephant on its back being dragged along the ground by another elephant, with a caption stating that elephants lacked knees – compare cow tipping). Europeans also interpreted descriptions of howdahs to mean that Indian elephants were capable of carrying actual stone castles on their backs, albeit only big enough to be garrisoned by three or four men; note that turreted war elephants did exist, though not ones made of stone. A carving of the elephant can be found on a contemporary miserichord in Exeter Cathedral. This animal may be the inspiration for the heraldic device &#x27;Elephant and Castle&#x27;, the arms of the Cutlers&#x27; Company of London, a guild founded in the 13th century responsible for making scissors, knives and the like. Its heraldry survived in an 18th-century pub-sign that in turn gave its name to a largely modern district in South London.
* In the 1470s King Christian I of Denmark founded a chivalric order, the &quot;Order of the Elephant&quot;, and had it confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. The order takes its name from the battle elephants which symbolized the Christian Crusades. , it continues to be awarded under statutes established by king Christian V in 1693, amended in 1958 to permit the admission of women to the order.
* The elephant given by Afonso V of Portugal to René d&#x27;Anjou about 1477.
* The merchants of Cyprus presented Ercole d&#x27;Este with an elephant in 1497.
* Suleyman the elephant, a present from the Portuguese king John III to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. Travelling from Spain in 1551, it arrived in Vienna in 1552, but died in 1554.
* Hanno, or &quot;Annone&quot;, was a white elephant presented by king Manuel I of Portugal to Pope Leo X on the occasion of his coronation in 1514. He died in 1518, probably of an intestinal obstruction misdiagnosed as angina, with Pope Leo at his side. His story is told in Silvio Bedini&#x27;s &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Elephant&quot; (Nashville: Sanders 1998). At the Villa Madama, in the garden facing the loggia, the Elephant Fountain designed by Giovanni da Udine depicts &quot;Annone&quot;, whose tomb was designed by Raphael himself.
*Hansken, a female elephant from Ceylon that became famous in early 17th-century Europe, touring through many countries demonstrating circus tricks, and sketched by Rembrandt and Stefano della Bella.

<text>Ready for the House is the debut studio album by Jandek, and was released in 1978 by his own Corwood Industries label, with the catalog number #0739. The artist has said in letters that the number was meaningless. Corwood Industries reissued the album three times on CD, first in 1999, then sometime in the early 2000s, and again in 2005. Jackpot Records, with exclusive permission from Corwood, reissued the album on LP in 2008.

==Album artwork==

The album cover features a photograph of a garishly colored room with a chair beside a window. The artwork of the original 1978 issue lacks text, while the back cover credits the album to &quot;The Units&quot;.

The album was not originally attributed to Jandek at all, but rather to &quot;the Units.&quot; The name Jandek replaced that of the Units on all future releases after a San Francisco new wave group of the same name gave Corwood Industries a cease and desist order; all subsequent reissues of &quot;Ready for the House&quot; now bear the Jandek name. Both &quot;The Units&quot; and &quot;Jandek&quot; are widely assumed to be the work of a Houston resident named Sterling Richard Smith. The name Jandek, according to Smith in a 1985 interview with John Trubee, comes from a conversation Smith had with a man named Decker in the month of January. The combination of January and Decker forms Jan-deck. Smith said the reasoning behind this was to come up with a name that nobody would pick, to avoid future legal problems. It is not publicly known if Corwood is also a combination of names. In early letters, Smith refers to the Jandek records as &#x27;units&#x27;, so one could take the band name &#x27;The Units&#x27; to basically mean &#x27;The Albums&#x27;, this would even fit in with Jandek&#x27;s aesthetic, which is very bare bones and stripped down to nothing.

&quot;Ready for the House&quot; was released with the catalog number #0739. There is no meaning behind the number, and all subsequent releases continue in order.

The music on the album consists of Jandek&#x27;s wavering voice and a guitar pick gently plucking very oddly tuned guitar strings. The guitar playing, which many refer to as &quot;untuned&quot; is in fact tuned to what the artist has referred to as a &quot;black key sound.&quot; Eight of the nine tracks largely repeat the same slow, slightly bluesy tempo with similar vocal delivery. On the ending track, &quot;European Jewel (Incomplete),&quot; Jandek switches from the acoustic to a strummed electric guitar that approaches standard tuning and instead of picking the strings, Jandek barres the frets. In the middle of the line &quot;just a shaking sha-&quot; the song abruptly cuts off, leading one to think that the tape has run out or that an error has occurred with the reel to reel tape recorder, and the album unexpectedly ends. The song would be resumed on &quot;Chair Beside a Window&quot;, beginning with the last three lines of the &quot;incomplete&quot; version and then continuing with the missing lyrics. The &quot;Chair Beside a Window&quot; version features what appears to be a live band version with electric guitar, bass, and drums. It revisited three more times on the album &quot;The Rocks Crumble&quot;, and it is assumed that Smith is overdubbing himself that time around, having told Chusid that there were instances of this in his letter. There are many notable instances where Jandek albums abruptly end so one could assume this is a motif.

It is unknown when this album was originally recorded. According to the Irwin Chusid article &#x27;The Great Disconnect&#x27;, around November 1980, Smith told Chusid that he had recorded enough material for 10 albums and hoped to release them all. This would back up the theory that the albums were recorded before 1978. On &quot;Ready for the House&quot; and its follow up &quot;Six and Six&quot;, Smith&#x27;s voice sounds the youngest out of all of his output. Smith has provided very little in the way of background information on any of his albums, let alone &quot;Ready for the House&quot;. The only information that he was able to provide was that he pressed 1,000 copies of &quot;Ready for the House&quot;, where as all subsequent recordings were pressed in quantities of 300 (although it is not 
known if any were repressed). This is probably due to the fact that by 1980 when Smith spoke to Chusid, he had only sold 2 copies of the album despite it being released 2 years previous. It received its first review, when Phil X. Milstein wrote about it in Op magazine issue L. Shortly after, outsider DJ Irwin Chusid of WFMU began corresponding with Corwood Industries, a label that has held the same PO box since this release, and which releases nothing but Jandek records. Through this attention, the artist was encouraged to return to music, releasing &quot;Six and Six&quot; three years later, which has been the longest period without a studio Jandek release until the period after Ghost Passing.

<text>Savory spinach pie is a pastry eaten throughout Southeastern Europe. The filling is made of chopped spinach (sometimes chard) and usually feta or white cheese, and egg.

== Etymology and history ==

=== Turkey ===
&quot;Ispanaklı Selanik Böreği&quot; and /or &quot;Ispanaklı Boşnak Böreği,&quot; is a Turkish savory spinach pie, or &quot;börek&quot;. The &quot;börek&quot; gets its name from either Selanik (Thessaloniki) or Bosnia as it is widely common in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
&quot;Zeljanica&quot; in Bosnia and Herzegovina is a savory pie filled with spinach, or sometime chard (in Serbo-Croatian &quot;blitva&quot;); the word burek (Turkish &quot;börek&quot;) is a pie filled with minced meat.

TasteAtlas, an encyclopedia of traditional dishes, in their presentation of the 100 best pastries in the world ranked Bosnian and Herzegovinian traditional pastry dishes, putting &quot;zeljanica&quot; above &quot;burek&quot;, &quot;sirnica&quot; and &quot;krompiruša&quot;.

=== Greece ===

Spanakopita (; , from &quot;spanáki&quot; &#x27;spinach&#x27;, and πίτα &quot;píta&quot; &#x27;pie&#x27;) is a Greek savory spinach pie. It often also contains cheese, typically feta, and may then be called &quot;spanakotiropita&quot; ( &quot;spinach-cheese pie&quot;), especially in northern Greece. In southern Greece, the term spanakopita is also common for the versions with cheese. A version without cheese and eggs is eaten during religious fasts throughout Greece. Spanakopita appears in many traditional Greek cookery books and appears in numerous restaurants and hotel menus throughout Greece and internationally.

==Ingredients and variations==

The traditional filling comprises chopped spinach, feta cheese, onions or scallions, egg, and seasoning. Other white, preferably salted cheeses such as kefalotiri may also be mixed with the feta cheese, and some may be used as a substitute for feta cheese. Herbs such as dill, mint and parsley may be used as flavouring. The filling is wrapped or layered in phyllo (filo) pastry with butter or olive oil, either in a large pan from which individual servings are cut, or rolled into individual triangular servings. While the filo-dough recipe is most common, some recipes use a village-style pastry &quot;horiatiko&quot;, which has a thicker crust. It can also be made with puff pastry. The pastry is golden in colour when baked, the colour often enhanced by butter and egg yolk. It can be served straight from the oven or at room temperature.

There is a &quot;fasting&quot; (; &quot;nistisimi&quot;), or vegan, version of spanakopita, eaten during Lent and other religious fasts. This version has spinach, onions or green onions, other green herbs like dill, parsley, or celery as filling and uses olive oil and a little wheat flour but no eggs or dairy products. The mixture is oven-baked until crisp. Non-traditional vegan versions are available that typically use tofu instead of cheese.

In rural Greece, smaller amounts of spinach are used, with the missing amount replaced with leeks, chard and sorrel.

==Related pastries==
&quot;Börek&quot; or &quot;burek&quot; is a family of pastries or pies found in the Balkans, Middle East and Central Asia. The pastry is made of a thin flaky dough such as filo with a variety of fillings, such as meat, cheese, spinach, or potatoes. Boreks are mainly associated with the Middle East, Armenia, and also with the former Ottoman Empire, including the Balkans and the South Caucasus, Eastern European and Central European countries, Northern Africa and Central Asia.

<doc id="187159" wikidata="Q878666" url="?curid=187159" title="Edward Rutledge">
<text>Edward Rutledge (November 23, 1749 – January 23, 1800) was an American Founding Father and politician who signed the Continental Association and was the youngest signatory of the Declaration of Independence. He later served as the 39th governor of South Carolina.

==Early life and education==
Rutledge was born in Charleston, South Carolina. He was the youngest of seven children (5 sons and 2 daughters) born to Dr. John Rutledge and Sarah Hext, who was 15 when her first child (John) was born. His father was a physician and colonist of Scots-Irish descent; his mother was born in South Carolina and was of English descent. Following his elder brothers, John and Hugh, he studied law in London at the Inns of Court. In 1772 he was admitted to the English bar (Middle Temple) and returned to Charleston to practice. 

He was married on March 1, 1774, to Henrietta Middleton (17 November 1750 – 22 April 1792), daughter of Henry Middleton. The couple had three children:
* Major Henry Middleton Rutledge (5 April 1775 – 20 January 1844)
* Edward Rutledge (20 March 1778 – 1780)
* Sarah Rutledge (1782–1855)

Rutledge had a successful law practice with his partner, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. He became a leading citizen of Charleston. He owned more than 50 enslaved people.

==Career==

===American Revolution===
During the American Revolution, Rutledge served along with his brother John representing South Carolina in the Continental Congress (1774–1776). He worked to have African Americans expelled from the Continental Army. Although a firm supporter of colonial rights, he (as a delegate) was instructed initially to oppose Richard Henry Lee&#x27;s Resolution of independence; South Carolina&#x27;s leaders were unsure that the time was &quot;ripe&quot;. At age 26 he was the youngest delegate to sign the Declaration of Independence.

He returned home in November 1776 to take a seat in the General Assembly. He served as a captain of artillery in the South Carolina militia, and fought at the Battle of Beaufort in 1779. In May 1780, Rutledge was captured along with his co-signers of the Declaration of Independence, Arthur Middleton and Thomas Heyward during the siege of Charleston and were taken to St. Augustine, Florida. They were released during a prisoner exchange in July 1781.

==Later life and death==
After his release he returned to the General Assembly, where he served until 1796. He was known as an active legislator and an advocate for the confiscation of Loyalist property. Like John Rutledge, Edward Rutledge opposed the Jay Treaty and the Anglophilic stance he perceived in the Federalist Party. As an elector in the 1796 presidential election, Rutledge voted for the two Southern candidates, Republican Thomas Jefferson and Federalist Thomas Pinckney.

Rutledge had not been close with the victor John Adams dating back to their days in the Continental Congress, but he approved of Adams&#x27;s defense policies towards France during the Quasi-War. The opposition afforded Adams&#x27;s measures by Vice President Jefferson, and the Congressional Republicans angered Rutledge because he now saw the Republicans as more partial to France than to American interests, a situation similar to the pro-British feelings he sensed in the Federalists during the Jay Treaty debates. Rutledge thereafter ceased communication with Jefferson. Rutledge served in the state senate for two years, then was elected governor in 1798.

Governor Rutledge, while attending an important meeting in Columbia, had to be sent home because of his gout. He died in Charleston before the end of his term. Some said at the time that he died from apoplexy resulting from hearing the news of George Washington&#x27;s death. Since 1971, his home in Charleston is now a National Historic Landmark, and is privately owned and operated as a bed &amp; breakfast, the Governor&#x27;s House Inn.

<text>Six and Six is the second studio album by American musician Jandek, and the first to be released under the Jandek name (the debut, &quot;Ready for the House&quot;, was credited to &quot;The Units&quot; on first pressing). It was released in 1981, by Corwood Industries (#0740). There have been two CD reissues so far, each adding more silence between the tracks.

This album appeared three years after &quot;Ready for the House&quot;, which remains the longest interval between Jandek albums so far. It is composed mainly of slow songs, most of which deal with topics like regret and hopelessness. The music is stark and slow, with a flattened-out dissonant blues sound.

FACT named it the 61st greatest album of the 80s.

<text>Later On is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Jandek, and the second released by Corwood Industries (#0741) in 1981. It was reissued on CD in 2000.

As with the prior &quot;Six and Six&quot; (and most of &quot;Ready for the House&quot;), this is a stark acoustic and vocals album with roots in Delta blues. Unlike the first two, however, the pace is picked up a bit, and there are other musicians present, or the harmonica appearing for the first time may be overdubbed.

The song &quot;The Janitor&quot; would receive a sequel eight years later on the album &quot;The Living End&quot; with the song &quot;Janitor&#x27;s Dead.&quot;

<doc id="187166" wikidata="Q732523" url="?curid=187166" title="Palm-nut vulture">
<text>The palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis) or vulturine fish eagle, is a large bird of prey in the family Accipitridae (which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, buzzards and harriers, vultures, and eagles). It is the only member of the genus Gypohierax.

This bird is an Old World vulture (only distantly related to the New World vultures, which are in a separate family, the Cathartidae).

It breeds in forest and savannah across sub-Saharan Africa, usually near water, its range coinciding with that of the oil and Raffia palms. It is quite approachable, like many African vultures, and can be seen near habitation, even on large hotel lawns in the tourist areas of countries such as the Gambia.

==Taxonomy==
The palm-nut vulture was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the eagles, hawks and falcons in the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco angolensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Angola vulture&quot; that had been described in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The Leverian Collection in London included two specimens that had been collected in Angola. The palm-nut vulture is now placed in the genus &quot;Gypohierax&quot; that was introduced for the species in 1836 by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;gups&quot; meaning &quot;vulture&quot; with &quot;hierax&quot; meaning &quot;hawk&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

== Description ==
This is a nearly unmistakable bird as an adult. At in weight, in length and with a wingspan of , this is the smallest Old World vulture. Its plumage is all white except for black areas in its wings and tail. It has a red patch around each eye. The juvenile, which takes 3–4 years to mature, is brown with yellow eye-patches. In flight, this species resembles an eagle more than a typical vulture, and it can sustain flapping flight, so it does not depend on thermals. With its extensive white plumage, and black wing- and tail-feathers, the adult palm-nut vulture can be crudely mistaken for both the African fish-eagle and the Egyptian vulture, but clearly lacks the chestnut body of the former and the white tail of the latter.

The sexes are identical in appearance, with the female being the same size as the male. Juveniles on the other hand are predominately brown with partially black wings and take a lengthy three to four years to make the transition into the adult plumage.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Palm-nut vultures are found throughout most of the coastal areas of the African continent from The Gambia to Kenya and as far South as South Africa. The total African population is estimated to be 80,000 pairs. There are approximately 40 birds in South Africa.

The only Southern African subregions to have resident breeding pairs of palm-nut vultures are South Africa and Mozambique. The breeding distribution of the palm-nut vulture during the 1970s census period was centred on the Raffia palm groves of the Kosi Bay system and Mtunzini. Its distribution is linked to the presence of the Raffia palm &quot;Raphia australis&quot; at all permanently occupied sites, and the existence of this species at Mtunzini is entirely due to the artificial cultivation of Raffia palms. Currently there are 7 known nesting sites in South Africa and a total of 40 individual birds.

As the name suggests, the distribution of the palm-nut vulture closely tracks that of oil (&quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot;) or raffia (&quot;Raphia&quot; sp.) palms. Consequently, it is most common in coastal forests and mangrove swamps below , but also occurs in wet savannas.

==Behaviour and ecology==
=== Food and feeding===
Unusual for birds of prey, the palm-nut vulture feeds mainly on the fleshy fruit-husks of the oil palm and on the palm-fruits of Raffia palms, as well as wild dates, oranges, other fruits, some grains and acacia seeds. These fruits make up over 60% of the adult bird&#x27;s diet and over 90% of the juvenile bird&#x27;s diet. It has also been recorded to feed on crabs (both freshwater and marine), molluscs, frogs, tadpoles, fish, dung beetles, termites, alate ants, alate termites, locusts, small mammals, birds and their nestlings, snakes, other reptiles, even reptiles’ eggs and hatchlings, and it has been known to occasionally attack domestic poultry and feed on carrion.

===Breeding===

Breeding pairs construct large stick nests high up in tall trees and will often exhibit a strong attachment to the nest site. They may stay at the nesting site for an entire year. Where Raphia Palms are present, breeding pairs will build a nest at the base of the palm fronds. At the beginning of the breeding season, pairs soar together in an aerial display of rolling and diving, much more acrobatic than most vultures. During each breeding cycle, a single, white and brown egg is laid, which is incubated by both sexes, over a period of four to six weeks. Normally around 85 to 90 days after hatching, the young brown chicks will fledge.

== Conservation status==
This species is widespread throughout much of Africa, overall fairly common and with a stable population. It is rarer and much more localized in South Africa, although not considered to be under any form of immediate threat in that country. That being said, the threats to this species in South Africa are not well understood. The low population size makes the species vulnerable to stochastic events. In Mozambique Parker (1999) observed that cutting down of coastal forest was threatening breeding habitat. The main threat to this species in South Africa is habitat loss. Open cast sand dune mining and urban expansion have reduced suitable habitats.

The cultivation of Raphia palms for its ornamental value is currently increasing providing food and nesting sites. There is also a large portion of its habitat protected by the Isimangaliso Wetland Park. There are no current species specific conservation initiatives as this species is the only vulture species in South Africa where the population size is increasing. The importance of maintaining this is that the South African satellite population in producing dispersing birds that are contributing to maintaining the Mozambique population (and hence the larger metapopulation).

<doc id="187168" wikidata="Q177386" url="?curid=187168" title="Hooded vulture">
<text>The hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus) is an Old World vulture in the order Accipitriformes, which also includes eagles, kites, buzzards and hawks. It is the only member of the genus &quot;Necrosyrtes,&quot; which is sister to the larger &quot;Gyps&quot; genus, both of which are a part of the Aegypiinae subfamily of Old World vultures. It is native to sub-Saharan Africa, where it has a widespread distribution with populations in southern, East and West Africa. It is a scruffy-looking, small vulture with dark brown plumage, a long thin bill, bare crown, face and fore-neck, and a downy nape and hind-neck. Its face is usually a light red colour. It typically scavenges on carcasses of wildlife and domestic animals. Although it remains a common species with a stable population in the lower region of Casamance, some areas of The Gambia, and Guinea-Bissau, other regions such as Dakar, Senegal, show more than 85% losses in population over the last 50 years. Threats include poisoning, hunting, loss of habitat and collisions with electricity infrastructure, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as &quot;critically endangered&quot; in their latest assessment (2022). The highest current regional density of hooded vultures is in the western region of The Gambia.

== Etymology ==
The common name &quot;hooded vulture&quot; stems from the fact that the vulture has a small patch of downy feathers that runs along the back of its neck to the crown of its head, making it look like it is wearing a fluffy, cream-colored hood. The scientific name, &quot;Necrosyrtes monachus,&quot; can be broken down into 3 sections: &quot;necro&quot;, since it feeds on carrion; &quot;syrtes&quot; which means &quot;quicksand&quot; or &quot;bog&quot; and &quot;monachus&quot; which is Latin for &quot;monk&quot; and relates to the hood of the vulture.

==Description==

=== Appearance ===
The hooded vulture is a typical vulture, with a head that is usually pinkish-white, but flushes red when agitated, and a grey to black &quot;hood&quot;. It has fairly uniform dark brown body plumage. It has broad wings for soaring and short tail feathers. This is one of the smaller Old World vultures. They are long, have a wingspan of and a body weight of . Both sexes are alike in appearance, although females often have longer eyelashes than males. Juveniles look like adults, only darker and plainer, and body feathers have a purplish sheen. 

=== Voice ===
Usually silent, but gives a shrill, sibilant whistle during copulation, and thin squealing calls both at nests and carcasses.

=== Nesting, breeding and behaviour ===
It breeds in a stick nest in trees (often palms) in much of Africa south of the Sahara, laying one egg. Birds may form loose colonies. The population is mostly resident and sedentary, rarely moving more than 200 km. 

== Distribution ==
Although hooded vultures have relatively small home ranges, they are widely distributed across Africa. It occurs in Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, The Gambia, Niger and Nigeria in West Africa; in East Africa it is found in Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia; in southern Africa it has been recorded in northern Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and South Africa.

Within South Africa, the species is essentially restricted to the Kruger National Park and surrounding protected areas in Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces, though vagrants have been recorded further west in Kwa-Zulu Natal and Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.

==Ecology==
Like other vultures hooded vultures are scavengers, feeding mostly from carcasses of dead animals and waste which they find by soaring over savanna and around human habitation, including waste tips and abattoirs. They do however also feed on insects, and conglomerate in large numbers during insect emergences, for example termite emergences where they associate with Steppe Eagles. They are non-specialised, highly versatile scavengers and are commensal with humans in West Africa. They often move in flocks (50-250 individuals) in West Africa, especially when foraging at abattoirs or elephant carcasses, while in southern Africa they are solitary and secretive, making them hard to spot when nesting. They are known to follow scavenging African wild dogs and hyaenas. 

This vulture is typically unafraid of humans, and frequently gathers around habitation. It is sometimes referred to as the “garbage collector” by locals. In Ghanaian universities, a significantly higher number of hooded vultures exist in the residential parts of the campus relative to the non-residential parts, and densities are correlated with the academic calendar, with numbers of individuals increasing during school terms. 45% of students at these campuses are defecated on by hooded vultures at least once a month, according to interviews.

Southern African hooded vulture populations have smaller home ranges than most other Old World vulture species for which data exists, though less is known about home ranges of East and West African populations. They are most active during the day, and their ranges are smaller in the dry breeding season, when their movement is constrained by a nest site location to which they must return regularly to incubate their eggs and provision their fledglings. In both the northern and southern hemisphere populations, breeding takes place in the dry summer season.

They prefer to build nests in well-foliaged trees along watercourses, with the nest placed a prominent fork within the tree canopy at an average height of over 15m. They have however also been observed in a variety of biomes, some where tall trees are rare. They have been recorded in open grasslands, deserts, wooded savanna, forest edges and along coasts. They tend to occur in higher densities where populations of larger &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures are low or nonexistent. It occurs up to 4,000 m, but is most numerous below 1,800 m.

Hooded vultures lay a clutch of one egg, and the incubation period lasts 46-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 80-130 days. Young are dependent on their parents for a further 3-4 months after fledging. Measurements of nesting success at the Olifants River Private Nature Reserve, South Africa showed success of 0.44-0.89 offspring per pair per year in 2013 and 0.50-0.67 offspring per pair per year in 2014.

== Population trends ==
While the populations in Gambia are relatively stable, it is declining almost everywhere else in its range at an average rate of 83% (range 64–93%) over 53 years (3 generations). Its total population is estimated at a maximum of 197 000 individuals. Some declines have been reported to have occurred in only 20 years, almost approaching the speed and extent of the Asian vulture crisis of the 1990s. The highest regional density of hooded vultures is in western Gambia.

==Status and threats==
The species has been uplisted from its previous IUCN status of endangered to critically endangered, since the species is going through a very steep decline in population, owing to various factors including poisoning, hunting, habitat loss and degradation of habitat. Hunting is the most well-known threat to the species, however, poisoning has been shown to have the highest impact on the population. Poisoning of the species has been both unintentional and intentional, with unintentional poisoning being caused through the poisoning of other animals which the species feeds on. Hunting on the other hand is caused by vultures being used by people in traditional medicine and cultural beliefs and as a food source, particularly in West and southern Africa. Researchers interviewed vendors in street markets in northern Nigeria who were selling parts or entire carcasses of hooded vultures as well as other African vulture species (though hooded vultures made up 90% of vultures on sale). They found that 40% of traders were selling the vultures for spiritual healing and 25% for human consumption. 

Many West and southern African cultures believe vulture body parts cure a range of physical and mental illnesses, improve success in gambling and business ventures, or increase intelligence in children. Consumption of vultures as bushmeat in Nigeria and Ivory Coast may be of regional concern, but smoked vulture meat is traded and consumed internationally. Secondary poisoning with carbofuran pesticides at livestock baits being used to poison mammalian predators is also an issue in East Africa.

On the 20th of June 2019, the carcasses of 468 white-backed vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures), altogether 537 vultures, besides 2 tawny eagles, were found in northern Botswana. It is suspected that they died after eating the carcasses of 3 elephants that were poisoned by poachers, possibly to avoid detection by the birds, which help rangers to track poaching activity by circling over the locations of dead animals.

The species may also be threatened by avian influenza (H5N1), from which it appears to suffer some mortality and which it probably acquires from feeding on discarded dead poultry. Another suggested cause of decline is the decline in the number of trees preferred by hooded vultures for nesting, such as &quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot; in Senegal. 

== Conservation action ==
Raptors are protected in many West African and Northeastern countries and in South Africa under the United Nations Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), in the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia (the ‘Raptors MoU’). This plan includes the Hooded vulture.

Systematic monitoring and protection schemes for African raptors, including the hooded vulture, exist and some populations occur within protected areas. It has been suggested that the best way to slow the decline of vulture populations in Africa, and avoid a massive decline on the scale of the Asian vulture crisis of the 1990s in which populations declined 95% because of the veterinary drug Diclofenac used in livestock whose carcasses were fed on by vultures, pesticides and poisons need to be regulated and limited by governments in countries where the hooded vulture occurs.

<text>The Rocks Crumble is the eighth Jandek album, released as Corwood 0746. It is his third release of 1983, and is the first Jandek album to feature extensive use of drums and electric guitar. It was reissued on CD in 2001.

==Overview==

&quot;The Rocks Crumble&quot; marks the beginning of what is often referenced as Corwood&#x27;s &quot;first electric period,&quot; since the majority of the album is played on electric guitar with clattering, earsplitting drums behind it. That said, Jandek eases us into this new phase gently, and its approach echoes the cover, in which an old Slingerland drum set is seen in a blurry, black and white photograph. For the next album, &quot;Interstellar Discussion&quot;, we get up close and personal with the same drum set (which appears frequently on Corwood covers), this time in full color.

The album starts like the prior seven, with an acoustic track. &quot;Faceless&quot; is an &quot;invisible man&quot; song in which the vocalist laments &quot;He wouldn’t even look into my eyes/he wouldn’t know my name/I seen him several hundred times.&quot; This leads into &quot;Birthday,&quot; a third variation on the song first recorded on &quot;Chair Beside a Window&quot; as &quot;Nancy Sings&quot; and on the previous album &quot;Your Turn to Fall&quot; as &quot;John Plays Drums.&quot; Here it is very similar to the first version, but with male vocals. This leads into three oddly-numbered versions of &quot;Ready for the House&quot;&#x27;s &quot;European Jewel.&quot; The first (&quot;European Jewel 613&quot;) is very similar to the one on the debut album, with vocal and electric guitar, though this time the song IS finished. The second (&quot;European Jewel II&quot;) appears to be an unfinished take for guitar and drums, or perhaps he was trying to shorten the song to &quot;single length&quot;? Hard to say, but the final version (&quot;European Jewel 501&quot;) kicks the pace of the shambling drums (overdubbed, according to the interview with John Trubee, by the same musician) and the song is played to completion.

This is followed by two lyrically different parts to &quot;Message to the Clerk,&quot; which is somewhat like early Dylan electric work, with the surreal verses (sample: &quot;and now you&#x27;re independent/brush your teeth three times a day&quot;) leading to the repeating refrain &quot;take a message to the clerk/tell him not to work.&quot; This song would be edited and redone for the On the Way album. The rest of the album continues the off-rhythm guitar and drums on more art/garage punk (&quot;Breathtaker&quot;) and an attempt at a slower electric track (&quot;Lonesome Company&quot;).

<text>The peniculids are an order of ciliate protozoa, including the well-known &quot;Paramecium&quot; and related genera, such as &quot;Frontonia&quot;, &quot;Stokesia&quot;, &quot;Urocentrum&quot; and &quot;Lembadion&quot;. Most are relatively large, freshwater forms that feed by sweeping smaller organisms into the mouth. They have weird life cycles, and in many cases do not even form resting cysts.

Typically the body has uniform, dense cilia, which also cover a vestibule preceding the mouth. Extrusomes are characteristically in the form of spindle trichocysts, which release thread-like shafts, and never mucocysts. The oral cilia include peniculi, corresponding to the membranelles of related groups, arranged parallel to the mouth deep in the oral cavity. Nematodesmata (rods) arise from the bases of the oral or perioral cilia, but these do not support a cyrtos as in some other classes. Two suborders are recognised:

* The Frontoniina typically have a shallow oral cavity, with a long paroral membrane and denser somatic kineties to the right of the mouth. These are called &quot;ophryokineties&quot;, and take part in forming the new mouth during cell division.
* The Parameciina typically have a deeper oral cavity, with peniculi mainly forward of the mouth, and the paroral membrane reduced, though still present throughout interphase.

The peniculids were first defined by Fauré-Fremiet in 1956. Originally they were one of three suborders of the hymenostomes, which are now treated as subclasses of the Oligohymenophorea. They were divided into two suborders by Small and Lynn in 1985, who placed them in the class Nassophorea, owing to ultrastructural peculiarities such as the presence of nematodesmata, which was considered to indicate the cyrtos was secondarily absent. However, more recent schemes reverse this move.

<text>Blue Corpse is the fifteenth album by Jandek, and his second for 1987. Primarily an all acoustic album with an unknown accompanist (identified only as &quot;Eddie&quot; during the instrumental break in &quot;Down at the Ball Park&quot;), it is considered by many to be one of the more accessible and cohesive albums in Jandek&#x27;s oeuvre.

==Album cover==

The cover of Blue Corpse completes the series of images that began with &quot;Telegraph Melts&quot; (1986) and was continued with &quot;Modern Dances&quot; (1987). While the cover of &quot;Modern Dances&quot; shows the artist standing still and looking forward, the cover of Blue Corpse shows the artist in mid stride, producing a blurred image of the artist.

==Album information==

The tracks &quot;I Passed by the Building&quot; through &quot;Variant&quot; features an unknown man on lead vocals. The tracks &quot;Part II&quot; through &quot;Only Lover&quot; appear to switch up this arrangement and feature Jandek on lead vocals and the unknown accompanist playing blues guitar, with the except of &quot;Harmonica&quot; which features solo harmonica. &quot;Quinn Boys&quot; appears to be Jandek solo, while the closer &quot;One Minute&quot; features the unknown accompanist singing lead vocals and it is unknown who is playing drums.

<doc id="187185" wikidata="Q409145" url="?curid=187185" title="Calmodulin">
<text>Calmodulin (CaM) (an abbreviation for calcium-modulated protein) is a multifunctional intermediate calcium-binding messenger protein expressed in all eukaryotic cells. It is an intracellular target of the secondary messenger Ca2+, and the binding of Ca2+ is required for the activation of calmodulin. Once bound to Ca2+, calmodulin acts as part of a calcium signal transduction pathway by modifying its interactions with various target proteins such as kinases or phosphatases.

== Structure ==
Calmodulin is a small, highly conserved protein that is 148 amino acids long (16.7 kDa). The protein has two approximately symmetrical globular domains (the N- and C- domains) each containing a pair of EF hand motifs separated by a flexible linker region for a total of four Ca2+ binding sites, two in each globular domain. In the Ca2+-free state, the helices that form the four EF-hands are collapsed in a compact orientation, and the central linker is disordered; in the Ca2+-saturated state, the EF-hand helices adopt an open orientation roughly perpendicular to one another, and the central linker forms an extended alpha-helix in the crystal structure, but remains largely disordered in solution. The C-domain has a higher binding affinity for Ca2+ than the N-domain.

Calmodulin is structurally quite similar to troponin C, another Ca2+-binding protein containing four EF-hand motifs. However, troponin C contains an additional alpha-helix at its N-terminus, and is constitutively bound to its target, troponin I. It therefore does not exhibit the same diversity of target recognition as does calmodulin.

=== Importance of flexibility in calmodulin ===
Calmodulin&#x27;s ability to recognize a tremendous range of target proteins is due in large part to its structural flexibility. In addition to the flexibility of the central linker domain, the N- and C-domains undergo open-closed conformational cycling in the Ca2+-bound state. Calmodulin also exhibits great structural variability, and undergoes considerable conformational fluctuations, when bound to targets. Moreover, the predominantly hydrophobic nature of binding between calmodulin and most of its targets allows for recognition of a broad range of target protein sequences. Together, these features allow calmodulin to recognize some 300 target proteins exhibiting a variety of CaM-binding sequence motifs.

==Mechanism==


Binding of Ca2+ by the EF-hands causes an opening of the N- and C-domains, which exposes hydrophobic target-binding surfaces. These surfaces interact with complementary nonpolar segments on target proteins, typically consisting of groups of bulky hydrophobic amino acids separated by 10–16 polar and/or basic amino acids. The flexible central domain of calmodulin allows the protein to wrap around its target, although alternate modes of binding are known. &quot;Canonical&quot; targets of calmodulin, such as myosin light-chain kinases and CaMKII, bind only to the Ca2+-bound protein, whereas some proteins, such as NaV channels and IQ-motif proteins, also bind to calmodulin in the absence of Ca2+. Binding of calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in the target protein via &quot;mutually induced fit&quot;, leading to changes in the target protein&#x27;s function.

Calcium binding by calmodulin exhibits considerable cooperativity, making calmodulin an unusual example of a monomeric (single-chain) cooperative binding protein. Furthermore, target binding alters the binding affinity of calmodulin toward Ca2+ ions, which allows for complex allosteric interplay between Ca2+ and target binding interactions. This influence of target binding on Ca2+ affinity is believed to allow for Ca2+ activation of proteins that are constitutively bound to calmodulin, such as small-conductance Ca2+-activated potassium (SK) channels.

Although calmodulin principally operates as a Ca2+ binding protein, it also coordinates other metal ions. For example, in the presence of typical intracellular concentrations of Mg2+ (0.5–1.0 mM) and resting concentrations of Ca2+ (100 nM), calmodulin&#x27;s Ca2+ binding sites are at least partially saturated by Mg2+. This Mg2+ is displaced by the higher concentrations of Ca2+ generated by signaling events. Similarly, Ca2+ may itself be displaced by other metal ions, such as the trivalent lanthanides, that associate with calmodulin&#x27;s binding pockets even more strongly than Ca2+. Though such ions distort calmodulin&#x27;s structure and are generally not physiologically relevant due to their scarcity &quot;in vivo&quot;, they have nonetheless seen wide scientific use as reporters of calmodulin structure and function.

==Role in animals==
Calmodulin mediates many crucial processes such as inflammation, metabolism, apoptosis, smooth muscle contraction, intracellular movement, short-term and long-term memory, and the immune response. Calcium participates in an intracellular signaling system by acting as a diffusible second messenger to the initial stimuli. It does this by binding various targets in the cell including a large number of enzymes, ion channels, aquaporins and other proteins. Calmodulin is expressed in many cell types and can have different subcellular locations, including the cytoplasm, within organelles, or associated with the plasma or organelle membranes, but it is always found intracellularly. Many of the proteins that calmodulin binds are unable to bind calcium themselves, and use calmodulin as a calcium sensor and signal transducer. Calmodulin can also make use of the calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calmodulin can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and proteolytic cleavage, each of which has potential to modulate its actions.

=== Specific examples ===

==== Role in smooth muscle contraction ====

Calmodulin plays an important role in excitation contraction (EC) coupling and the initiation of the cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle, ultimately causing smooth muscle contraction. In order to activate contraction of smooth muscle, the head of the myosin light chain must be phosphorylated. This phosphorylation is done by myosin light chain (MLC) kinase. This MLC kinase is activated by a calmodulin when it is bound by calcium, thus making smooth muscle contraction dependent on the presence of calcium, through the binding of calmodulin and activation of MLC kinase.

Another way that calmodulin affects muscle contraction is by controlling the movement of Ca2+ across both the cell and sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. The Ca2+ channels, such as the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, can be inhibited by calmodulin bound to calcium, thus affecting the overall levels of calcium in the cell. Calcium pumps take calcium out of the cytoplasm or store it in the endoplasmic reticulum and this control helps regulate many downstream processes.

This is a very important function of calmodulin because it indirectly plays a role in every physiological process that is affected by smooth muscle contraction such as digestion and contraction of arteries (which helps distribute blood and regulate blood pressure).

==== Role in metabolism ====
Calmodulin plays an important role in the activation of phosphorylase kinase, which ultimately leads to glucose being cleaved from glycogen by glycogen phosphorylase.

Calmodulin also plays an important role in lipid metabolism by affecting calcitonin. Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone that lowers blood Ca2+ levels and activates Gs protein cascades that leads to the generation of cAMP. The actions of calcitonin can be blocked by inhibiting the actions of calmodulin, suggesting that calmodulin plays a crucial role in the activation of calcitonin.

==== Role in short-term and long-term memory ====
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a crucial role in a type of synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) which requires the presence of calcium/calmodulin. CaMKII contributes to the phosphorylation of an AMPA receptor which increases the sensitivity of AMPA receptors. Furthermore, research shows that inhibiting CaMKII interferes with LTP.

== Role in plants ==
While yeasts have only a single CaM gene, plants and vertebrates contain an evolutionarily conserved form of CaM genes. The difference between plants and animals in Ca2+ signaling is that the plants contain an extended family of the CaM in addition to the evolutionarily conserved form. Calmodulins play an essential role in plant development and adaptation to environmental stimuli.

Calcium plays a key role in the structural integrity of the cell wall and the membrane system of the cell. However, high calcium levels can be toxic to a plant&#x27;s cellular energy metabolism and, hence, the Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol is maintained at a submicromolar level by removing the cytosolic Ca2+ to either the apoplast or the lumen of the intracellular organelles. Ca2+ pulses created due to increased influx and efflux act as cellular signals in response to external stimuli such as hormones, light, gravity, abiotic stress factors and also interactions with pathogens.

=== CMLs (CaM-related proteins) ===
Plants contain CaM-related proteins (CMLs) apart from the typical CaM proteins. The CMLs have about 15% amino acid similarity with the typical CaMs. &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; contains about 50 different CML genes, which leads to the question of what purpose these diverse ranges of proteins serve in the cellular function. All plant species exhibit this diversity in the CML genes. The different CaMs and CMLs differ in their affinity to bind and activate the CaM-regulated enzymes &quot;in vivo&quot;. The CaM or CMLs are also found to be located in different organelle compartments.

===Plant growth and development===
In &quot;Arabidopsis,&quot; the protein DWF1 plays an enzymatic role in the biosynthesis of brassinosteroids, steroid hormones in plants that are required for growth. An interaction occurs between CaM and DWF1, and DWF1 being unable to bind CaM is unable to produce a regular growth phenotype in plants. Hence, CaM is essential for the DWF1 function in plant growth.

CaM binding proteins are also known to regulate reproductive development in plants. For instance, the CaM-binding protein kinase in tobacco acts as a negative regulator of flowering. However, these CaM-binding protein kinase are also present in the shoot apical meristem of tobacco and a high concentration of these kinases in the meristem causes a delayed transition to flowering in the plant.

&quot;S&quot;-locus receptor kinase (SRK) is another protein kinase that interacts with CaM. SRK is involved in the self-incompatibility responses involved in pollen-pistil interactions in &quot;Brassica&quot;.

CaM targets in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; are also involved in pollen development and fertilization. Ca2+ transporters are essential for pollen tube growth. Hence, a constant Ca2+ gradient is maintained at the apex of pollen tube for elongation during the process of fertilization. Similarly, CaM is also essential at the pollen tube apex, where its primarily role involves the guidance of the pollen tube growth.

===Interaction with microbes===
====Nodule formation====
Ca2+ plays an important role in nodule formation in legumes. Nitrogen is an essential element required in plants and many legumes, unable to fix nitrogen independently, pair symbiotically with nitrogen-fixing bacteria that reduce nitrogen to ammonia. This legume-&quot;Rhizobium&quot; interaction establishment requires the Nod factor that is produced by the &quot;Rhizobium&quot; bacteria. The Nod factor is recognized by the root hair cells that are involved in the nodule formation in legumes. Ca2+ responses of varied nature are characterized to be involved in the Nod factor recognition. There is a Ca2+ flux at the tip of the root hair initially followed by repetitive oscillation of Ca2+ in the cytosol and also Ca2+ spike occurs around the nucleus. DMI3, an essential gene for Nod factor signaling functions downstream of the Ca2+ spiking signature, might be recognizing the Ca2+ signature. Further, several CaM and CML genes in &quot;Medicago&quot; and &quot;Lotus&quot; are expressed in nodules.

====Pathogen defense====
Among the diverse range of defense strategies plants utilize against pathogens, Ca2+ signaling is very common. Free Ca2+ levels in the cytoplasm increases in response to a pathogenic infection. Ca2+ signatures of this nature usually activate the plant defense system by inducing defense-related genes and the hypersensitive cell death. CaMs, CMLs and CaM-binding proteins are some of the recently identified elements of the plant defense signaling pathways. Several CML genes in tobacco, bean and tomato are responsive to pathogens. CML43 is a CaM-related protein that, as isolated from APR134 gene in the disease-resistant leaves of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; for gene expression analysis, is rapidly induced when the leaves are inoculated with &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot;. These genes are also found in tomatoes (&quot;Solanum lycopersicum&quot;). The CML43 from the APR134 also binds to Ca2+ ions in vitro which shows that CML43 and APR134 are, hence, involved in the Ca2+-dependent signaling during the plant immune response to bacterial pathogens. The CML9 expression in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; is rapidly induced by phytopathogenic bacteria, flagellin and salicylic acid. Expression of soybean SCaM4 and SCaM5 in transgenic &quot;tobacco&quot; and &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; causes an activation of genes related to pathogen resistance and also results in enhanced resistance to a wide spectrum of pathogen infection. The same is not true for soybean SCaM1 and SCaM2 that are highly conserved CaM isoforms. The &quot;At&quot;BAG6 protein is a CaM-binding protein that binds to CaM only in the absence of Ca2+ and not in the presence of it. &quot;At&quot;BAG6 is responsible for the hypersensitive response of programmed cell death in order to prevent the spread of pathogen infection or to restrict pathogen growth. Mutations in the CaM binding proteins can lead to severe effects on the defense response of the plants towards pathogen infections. Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) are functional protein channels in the plasma membrane that have overlapping CaM binding sites transport divalent cations such as Ca2+. However, the exact role of the positioning of the CNGCs in this pathway for plant defense is still unclear.

=== Abiotic stress response in plants ===
Change in intracellular Ca2+ levels is used as a signature for diverse responses towards mechanical stimuli, osmotic and salt treatments, and cold and heat shocks. Different root cell types show a different Ca2+ response to osmotic and salt stresses and this implies the cellular specificities of Ca2+ patterns. In response to external stress CaM activates glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) that catalyzes the conversion of -glutamate to GABA. A tight control on the GABA synthesis is important for plant development and, hence, increased GABA levels can essentially affect plant development. Therefore, external stress can affect plant growth and development and CaM are involved in that pathway controlling this effect.

===Plant examples===
====Sorghum====
The plant sorghum is well established model organism and can adapt in hot and dry environments. For this reason, it is used as a model to study calmodulin&#x27;s role in plants. Sorghum contains seedlings that express a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein, SbGRBP. This particular protein can be modulated by using heat as a stressor. Its unique location in the cell nucleus and cytosol demonstrates interaction with calmodulin that requires the use of Ca2+. By exposing the plant to versatile stress conditions, it can cause different proteins that enable the plant cells to tolerate environmental changes to become repressed. These modulated stress proteins are shown to interact with CaM. The &quot;CaMBP&quot; genes expressed in the sorghum are depicted as a “model crop” for researching the tolerance to heat and drought stress.

====&quot;Arabidopsis&quot;====
In an &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; study, hundreds of different proteins demonstrated the possibility to bind to CaM in plants.

==Family members==

* calmodulin 1 pseudogene 1 ()
* Calmodulin-like 3 ()
* Calmodulin-like 4 ()
* Calmodulin-like 5 ()

== Other calcium-binding proteins ==
Calmodulin belongs to one of the two main groups of calcium-binding proteins, called EF hand proteins. The other group, called annexins, bind calcium and phospholipids such as lipocortin. Many other proteins bind calcium, although binding calcium may not be considered their principal function in the cell.

<text>Werribee Gorge State Park is a state park in Victoria, Australia. It is located near Bacchus Marsh and is used by bushwalkers and rock climbers, who are attracted to its views and geological features.

== Werribee Gorge ==
The main feature of this park is the Werribee Gorge, through which the Werribee River meanders. This gorge has acquired some renown throughout the 20th century for its geological value.

Werribee Gorge has attracted the attention of geologists last century as one of the earliest known ancient glacial deposits, parts of which can be seen. The 200m deep gorge was formed about a million years ago when movements along a fault in the Earth&#x27;s crust steepened the river&#x27;s gradient. Since then the stream has continued to deepen the gorge through underlying rock to ancient sediments deposited in a sea more than 400 million years ago. Other geological events that have since occurred include the advance and retreat of an ice sheet and the inflow of volcanic lava.

There is a walking track which winds itself through the gorge, which is used by bushwalkers and locals.

== Getting there ==

Werribee Gorge State Park is about 8 km west of Bacchus Marsh and can be approached by two routes. The first is via the Western Freeway and the Pentland Hills Road to Myers Road, a gravel road steep in places. This provides access to the Gorge itself. The second is via Ironbark Road (the Ballan-Ingliston Road) which is approached from the Bacchus Marsh-Anakie Road.

<doc id="187192" wikidata="Q1455619" url="?curid=187192" title="Frequency allocation">
<text>Frequency allocation (or spectrum allocation) is the part of spectrum management dealing with the designation and regulation of the electromagnetic spectrum into frequency bands, normally done by governments in most countries. Because radio propagation does not stop at national boundaries, governments have sought to harmonise the allocation of RF bands and their standardization.

==ITU definition==
The International Telecommunication Union defines frequency allocation as being of &quot;a given frequency band for the purpose of its use by one or more terrestrial or space radiocommunication services or the radio astronomy service under specified conditions&quot;.

&quot;Frequency allocation&quot; is also a special term, used in national frequency administration. Other terms are:

==Bodies==
Several bodies set standards for frequency allocation, including:
* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
* European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)
* Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL)

To improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, most service allocations are incorporated in national Tables of Frequency Allocations and Utilisations within the responsibility of the appropriate national administration. Allocations are:
* primary
* secondary
* exclusive or shared utilization, within the responsibility of national administrations.

Allocations of military usage will be in accordance with the ITU Radio Regulations. In NATO countries, military mobile utilizations are made in accordance with the NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).

== Examples ==
Some of the bands listed (e.g., amateur 1.8–29.7 MHz) have gaps / are not continuous allocations.

* BCB is an abbreviation for broadcast band, for commercial radio news and music broadcasts.

<doc id="187202" wikidata="Q986431" url="?curid=187202" title="Southern District, Hong Kong">
<text>The Southern District is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. It is located in the southern part of Hong Kong Island and the largest part of the island. It had a population of 274,994 in 2016.

==Geography==

The Southern District faces the South China Sea at the south, and is backed by hills and reservoirs, designated as country parks, at the north. The eastern half of the district is semi-rural, with some of Hong Kong&#x27;s most popular beaches. The western half of the district is partly residential and partly industrial.

==Residential areas==
The residents of Southern District vary from the Chinese majority, resident minorities, to the community of expatriates. The eastern half containing areas such as Stanley and Repulse Bay is especially popular among expatriates and affluent locals because of the combination of its close proximity to Central and the wholesome environment. The western half of Southern district is more urbanized, with areas such as Aberdeen containing more housing developments than the eastern half.

Large private housing estates in the district include: Baguio Villa, , , South Horizons, Bel-Air (Cyberport), Redhill Peninsula and Hong Kong Parkview.

==Areas and attractions==
The district includes the following areas:

* Aberdeen
* Ap Lei Chau, an island connected to Aberdeen by three bridges (two for road and the other for rail)
* Cape D&#x27;Aguilar, where Cape D&#x27;Aguilar Marine Reserve is located
* Deep Water Bay
* Pok Fu Lam
* Repulse Bay
* Shek O
* Shouson Hill
* Stanley
* Tai Tam
* Wah Fu
* Wong Chuk Hang

Islands of the district:
* Aberdeen Island or Ap Lei Chau
* Ap Lei Pai
* Kau Pei Chau ()
* Lo Chau ()
* Lung Shan Pai ()
* Magazine Island ()
* Middle Island (熨波洲, Tong Po Chau)
* Ng Fan Chau ()

* Round Island ()
* Tai Tau Chau ()
* Tau Chau ()

Tourist attractions within the district include Aberdeen&#x27;s floating restaurants and fishing harbour; the Ocean Park; the swimming beach of Repulse Bay; The Home of Teresa Teng; the souvenir market and, formerly, the Hong Kong Maritime Museum at Stanley.

==Education==
* List of schools in Southern District, Hong Kong

==Transport==
The Southern District is served by Pok Fu Lam Road, Aberdeen Tunnel, Wong Nai Chung Gap Road and Tai Tam Road. It became the last district of Hong Kong to be served by the MTR, when the South Island line commenced operations in 2016, linking Ap Lei Chau and Wong Chuk Hang with Admiralty. The proposed MTR South Island line (West) will serve the western half of the area. There are currently no proposed routes to Stanley or Repulse Bay due to the large number of buses that serve those destinations.

<doc id="187203" wikidata="Q2448822" url="?curid=187203" title="Trans Australia Airlines">
<text>Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), renamed Australian Airlines in 1986, was one of the two major Australian domestic airlines between its inception in 1946 and its merger with Qantas in September 1992. As a result of the &quot;COBRA&quot; (or Common Branding) project, the entire airline was rebranded Qantas about a year later with tickets stating in small print &quot;Australian Airlines Limited trading as Qantas Airways Limited&quot; until the adoption of a single Air Operator Certificate a few years later. At that point, the entire airline was officially renamed &quot;Qantas Airways Limited&quot; continuing the name and livery of the parent company with the only change being the change of by-line from &quot;The Spirit of Australia&quot; to &quot;The Australian Airline&quot; under the window line with the existing &quot;Qantas&quot; title appearing above.

During its period as TAA, the company played a major part in the development of the Australian domestic air transport industry. The establishment of TAA broke the domestic air transport monopoly of Australian National Airways (ANA) in the late 1940s, and taking over the Queensland air network from Qantas. It was also at the time TAA supported the Flying Doctor Services of Australia by providing aircraft, pilots and engineers to ensure every emergency was answered quickly. Qantas had also been instrumental in the formation of the Flying Doctor Service.

The airline&#x27;s headquarters were located in Melbourne. In 1954 TAA became the first airline outside Europe to introduce the Vickers Viscount, and in 1981 it introduced the Airbus A300, the first wide-body aircraft to be purchased by an Australian domestic airline providing TAA with a clear edge over a major competitor at the time, Ansett which had purchased instead, the Boeing 767-200, receiving the type approximately a year later. Ironically, although the A300s were initially painted in full Qantas livery, they were phased out within a few years being replaced by previously international operated Qantas 767-238ERs, 767-338ERs and later supplemented by seven ex-British Airways 767-336ERs.

Qantas revived the Australian Airlines brand between 2002 and 2006 to serve the low-cost leisure market of visitors to and from Australia but using a full-service model, operating selected Qantas 767-338ERs – although the livery used was not the same as that used by the previous domestic operation.

==History==
===Background===

Up until World War II, Australia had been one of the world&#x27;s leading centres of aviation. With its tiny population of about seven million, Australia ranked sixth in the world for scheduled air mileage, had 16 airlines, was growing at twice the world average and had produced a number of prominent aviation pioneers, including Lawrence Hargrave, Harry Hawker, Bert Hinkler, Lawrence Wackett, the Reverend John Flynn, Sidney Cotton, Keith Virtue and Charles Kingsford Smith. Governments on both sides of politics, well aware of the immense stretches of uninhabitable desert that separated the small productive regions of Australia, regarded air transport as a matter of national importance (as did the governments of other geographically large nations, such as the Soviet Union and the United States). In the words of Director General of Civil Aviation AB Corbett: A nation which refuses to use flying in its national life must necessarily today be a backward and defenceless nation.
 Air transport was encouraged both with direct subsidies and with mail contracts. Immediately before the start of the war, more than half of all airline passenger and freight miles were subsidised.

However, after 1939 and especially after Japan&#x27;s invasion of the islands to the north in 1941, civil aviation was sacrificed to military needs. By the end of the war, there were only nine domestic airlines remaining, eight smaller regional concerns, and Australian National Airways (ANA), a conglomerate owned by British and Australian shipping interests which had a virtual monopoly on the major trunk routes and received 85% of all government air transport subsidies.

The Chifley government&#x27;s view was summed up by Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford: Air transport, the government believed, was primarily a public service, like hospitals, the railways, or the post office. If there was to be a monopoly at all, then it should be one owned by the public and working in the public interest.

In August 1945, two days after the end of World War II, the Australian parliament passed the Australian National Airways Bill, which set up the Australian National Airways Commission (ANAC) and charged it with the task of reconstructing the nation&#x27;s air transport industry. In keeping with the Labor government&#x27;s socialist leanings, the bill declared that the licenses of private operators would lapse for those routes that were adequately serviced by the national carrier. From this time on, it seemed, that air transport in Australia would be a government monopoly. However, a legal challenge, backed by the Liberal opposition and business interests generally, was successful and in December 1945, the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth did not have the power to prevent the issue of airline licenses to private companies. The government could set up an airline if it wished, but it could not legislate a monopoly. Much of the press objected strongly to the setting up of a public airline network, seeing it as a form of socialisation by stealth.

===Beginnings===

With the bill suitably amended to remove the monopoly provisions, the Australian National Airways Commission came into existence in February 1946. The commissioners themselves were prominent high-achievers, including the director-general of civil aviation, the deputy director, a Labor party luminary and former member of the Commonwealth Bank board, the director-general of posts and telegraphs, and the assistant secretary of the Treasury. The commission was to be chaired by Arthur Coles.

Coles was one of the richest men in Australia and the co-founder of the Coles Group. By this time, Coles had withdrawn from the active management of the family business. He was &#x27;a great believer in competition for business&#x27; and would not have accepted the post of Chairman of the ANAC had the monopoly provision been retained.

The Commission decided on the name &quot;Trans-Australia Airlines&quot;, applied to the Treasury for a preliminary advance of £10,000 and set about making plans, recruiting staff, and purchasing equipment. Reg Ansett, proprietor of the small Victorian company Ansett Airways was quick to offer to get the new airline off to a flying start by selling his entire operation to the ANAC as a going concern, including, if desired, his own services as managing agent. The asking price, the Commission decided, was optimistic, and Ansett declined a more modest counter offer.

There was considerable correspondence between the Commission and Ivan Holyman, the Chairman of ANA, with a view to recruiting Holyman as General Manager of TAA at the princely salary of £10,000 pa, and, when that offer was declined, of buying the near-monopoly airline outright. Holyman was not willing to sell, nor to work for a government-owned body, but was interested in setting up a &quot;composite company&quot;, the details of which proposal remained unclear.

Eventually, the ANAC proceeded with the original plan, to build an airline from scratch. One of the first people hired was Lester Brain, then the operations manager at Qantas. Brain had 22 years of pioneering aviation experience behind him and was regarded as the man behind Qantas&#x27; reputation for technical excellence. He applied for the advertised position of TAA Operations Manager, but to his surprise and delight, was instead offered an appointment as General Manager — though at £3,000 pa, not the £10,000 that had been offered to Holyman.
TAA acquired its first two aircraft in mid-June 1946, both Douglas DC-3s. A dozen more DC-3s would be added over the next few months, all ex-Royal Australian Air Force aircraft originally bought by the Australian Government under lend-lease. In July, the Treasury released £350,000 to allow TAA to order four larger, more modern Douglas DC-4s in the United States, and Brain appointed Aubrey Koch (from Qantas) as Senior Pilot DC4 Skymaster and John Watkins as Chief Technical Officer. Watkins would become one of the key figures in TAA&#x27;s success. His first task was to travel to the United States to accept delivery of the DC-4s. He later wrote:

It was typical of Coles, who knew nothing about aircraft, to reason that quality equipment would be vital, and then select the best man for the job of finding it and be prepared to back his judgement.

At this point, political considerations came to the fore again. TAA planned to start regular services on 7 October, but there was a federal election set for 28 September. Britain&#x27;s wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill had been enormously popular during the darkest hours but was voted out at the first post-war opportunity. There was no certainty that the Chifley government would not be treated likewise, and the opposition was opposed to government ownership. Coles addressed the Commission at a meeting on 2 September 1946.

After some discussion, it was agreed that the airline was not ready. It had a name, some excellent pilots, and some aircraft, but no ground facilities, no sales staff, no documentation, not even tickets. With a great deal of effort, it should be possible to make the planned start date of 7 October. With the discussion complete, Coles said:
After a week of frantic effort hiring staff, borrowing a tin shed at the RAAF base at Laverton because Essendon Airport had been turned into mud by heavy rain, creating operations manuals, passenger manifests, tickets, and load sheets — even making passenger steps and baggage carts because there was no time to buy them in the ordinary way — Captains Hepburn and Nickels took off from Laverton at 5:45 am bound for Sydney. TAA&#x27;s first scheduled flight carried a full load of VIPs and just one paying passenger.

===Rapid expansion===

The subsequent few years led to massive growth for the new airline. As post-war austerity gave way to a more affluent era, Australians were able to travel by air in ever-increasing numbers.

Much of the growth in domestic aviation in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s was dominated by the rivalry between the privately owned Ansett-ANA and the government-supported TAA. A major factor in the success of the government airline was the wise choice of aircraft. After initially utilising the venerable and readily available Douglas DC-3, TAA was able to acquire the revolutionary pressurised Convair 240. Popular with the travelling public because of its ability to fly above much of the weather, it was really this aircraft that established the airline&#x27;s reputation for excellence and service reliability.
East-coast services were continually expanded and TAA soon earned its title as a true &#x27;trans Australian&#x27; airline with services to Perth on the west coast of the continent, using Douglas DC-4 aircraft. Vickers Viscount turboprop aircraft were introduced in the 1950s and again proved immensely popular as a result of their smooth, vibration-free ride.

Although government-owned, the Liberal conservative government of the 1950s had a philosophical leaning towards the needs of the privately owned Ansett and the requirements of TAA suffered as a result. The controversial Two Airlines Policy was introduced and effectively seriously limited growth and expansion opportunities for the airlines without government approval.

Flight numbers and schedules were strictly controlled, and TAA and Ansett-ANA invariably had flights departing airports for the same destination at exactly the same time with exactly the same equipment. The policy was so strict that even newly purchased identical aircraft (one from each airline) were required on their delivery flights to enter Australian airspace at exactly the same time.

The conservative government&#x27;s benevolent attitude towards Ansett was epitomised in the 1950s when it forced TAA to swap a number of its popular turbo-prop Viscount aircraft with Ansett-ANA in return for slower and older, piston-engined Douglas DC-6Bs. In another instance, TAA had planned to re-equip with the revolutionary Sud Aviation Caravelle pure-jet but as Ansett felt this was too advanced at that stage for their own needs, both airlines were required to purchase the Ansett preference: the less advanced turbo-prop Lockheed L-188 Electra.

The Electra proved a reliable aircraft and TAA continuously grew and prospered. In the 1960s it introduced Boeing 727-100 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 Whispering T-Jets on primary routes as well as Fokker F27 Friendship Jetliner turboprops on regional routes.

By the late 1960s it had a massive network crisscrossing the continent, as well as an internal network within Papua New Guinea and flights from Darwin to Baucau in Portuguese Timor. At this time the airline&#x27;s livery was the famous white &quot;T&quot; on a blue tail, referred to as &quot;The Look of the &#x27;70s&quot;. One of the more memorable television advertisements of the period was the jingle &quot;Up, up and away, with TAA, the friendly friendly way&quot;, whose lyrics and music were a variation on the 1967 song &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, written by Jimmy Webb and also used by the US airline Trans World Airlines.

Further expansion occurred in the 1970s and larger 727-276s (simultaneously with Ansett) were acquired. Once again the terms of the introduction were restricted by the Two Airlines Policy. In 1974, TAA acquired a majority shareholding in Great Keppel Island. In July 1975 in partnership with Mayne Nickless it formed coach operator AAT Kings. In 1978, car rental company Kay-Hertz was purchased in partnership with Mayne Nickless. In December 1980, TAA commenced operating a service from Hobart to Wellington in New Zealand under a Qantas flight number.

The Two Airlines Policy was marginally relaxed in the early 1980s when TAA was able to introduce the Airbus A300B4, whilst Ansett chose to purchase the Boeing 767. The A300 was a revolutionary aircraft at the time for the domestic airline industry, in that it was a wide-body (twin-aisle) aircraft. It provided significant extra capacity on the trunk east coast network and to Perth. In 1986, Trans-Australia Airlines was rebranded as &#x27;Australian Airlines&#x27; and the kangaroo returned to its livery. Its new image coincided with a very successful and popular television campaign: &quot;You Should See Us Now&quot;, &quot;Face To Face&quot; and &quot;The Way We Do The Things We Do&quot; became the carrier&#x27;s new theme songs.

===Rebranding===

In 1986, after a change of airline management, the name Trans-Australia Airlines was controversially dropped, in favour of Australian Airlines. Associated with this image change was a new livery for the airlines&#x27; aircraft, which wore the title &quot;Australian&quot;.

Australian Airlines was the travel sponsor for the television shows &quot;Neighbours&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune and Sale of the Century&quot; between late 1987 and 1994.

Between 1980 and the merger with Qantas, selected teams participating in the Australian Touring Car Championship bore both Trans Australian Airlines (TAA) and Australian Airlines insignia, and from 1985 to 1990 the Seven Network commentary team used the airline to travel between the states to attend the various racing venues.

By the end of the 1980s, the government began to move towards deregulation of domestic aviation. Deregulation took effect in October 1990. A by-product of this impending change was the 1989 Australian pilots&#x27; dispute. As the result of prolonged wage suppression, this dispute saw the resignation of the majority of Australian Airlines&#x27; aircrew and the basic structure of the airline was changed forever. The Hawke cabinet not only encouraged the airline companies to employ overseas &quot;strike breakers&quot; but went even further, opting to pay the newly employed pilots from the public purse.

===Downturn===
The early 1990s changed the face of Australian domestic air travel. The Federal Government, although technically having deregulated the domestic aviation sector, made it effectively impossible for new entrant Compass Airlines to succeed. In 1987, the Hawke government announced that the then government-owned domestic air terminals would be effectively privatised and leased to the two domestic airlines. Compass, a threat to the TAA/Ansett duopoly, was granted severely limited access to terminal facilities. 

At Sydney Airport both major airlines had effectively been given freehold ownership of their two separate terminals. The Federal Airports Corporation later purchased the Ansett terminal when it went broke in 2002. Any third airline operating there had to make do with the regional airline facilities. At other airports the two airlines had leased mostly empty terminals and installed all operational furnishings themselves. The airport authorities eagerly accepted lease money from Compass while providing almost no space in their terminals.

The ambitious new airline was allocated by the government what were clearly the worst gates, in the least desirable sections of domestic terminals across the country (in some cases, Atco huts were used) and had to operate from the international terminal at Perth Airport. As the result of liens placed over the Compass aircraft (due to alleged non-payment of airways expenses), the government&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority effectively caused the shutting down of Compass on 20 December 1991, 5 days before what would have been the immensely profitable Christmas travel period. A seemingly well-orchestrated plan saw the Compass aircraft quickly flown out of the country and, with them, potentially the demise of a truly deregulated domestic aviation sector.

Ansett and TAA/Australian were the sole remaining players, in effect a de facto two-airline policy yet again. Throughout this period of transformation and deregulation, Australian Airlines continued its successful run by posting healthy profits, increasing passenger loads and gained much favour from its catchy television commercials. Although the merger with Qantas was seen as inevitable to give the latter a domestic network — and revive its bottom line — many former staff of Australian Airlines (TAA) and the general public mourned the loss of this iconic Australian brand.

===Acquisition by Qantas===
Although Compass was controversially and perhaps inevitably forced out of business, Australian&#x27;s days, and those of Ansett, were numbered: the decision had been made at the Federal Government level to offer both government-owned carriers, Qantas and Australian, for sale. Australian Airlines was offered first but was quickly snapped up by Qantas, which offered $400m to purchase the domestic carrier. Qantas then decided to merge the airline into its network. Subsequently the government offered the entire merged operation in a public float, after selling a cornerstone 25% stake to British Airways, returning Qantas to the stock market after being absent from listing since 1947.

Qantas acquired Australian Airlines on 14 September 1992, in preparation for its closure on 30 April 1994. Subsequent to the merger, TAA/Australian&#x27;s Boeing customer code &#x27;76&#x27; was replaced by the Qantas&#x27;s customer code &#x27;38&#x27; for all subsequent Boeing aircraft deliveries, beginning with the Boeing 737-838.

The majority of the Australian Airlines branding was removed during the merger and replaced with Qantas branding; for instance, Australian&#x27;s Flight Deck Lounge became The Qantas Club. The sole remaining Australian Airlines brand identity – The Australian Way (inflight) magazine – was rebranded as The Qantas Magazine in 2016.

===Rebirth===
In October 2002, Qantas revived the Australian Airlines brand as a full-service carrier, targeting the low-cost leisure market and flying primarily out of Cairns and Bali. This airline was disbanded in 2006 and its assets were absorbed back into the Qantas group.

===TAA Museum===
Qantas currently allocates space at its Airport West Training Facility (formerly the TAA/Australian Airlines Flight Training Centre) for The TAA Museum. The museum displays artefacts from the life of TAA/Australian including service ware, uniforms, advertisements, and photographs and is open to the public during the week.

==Fleet==
Over the years, the airline operated the following aircraft types:
Australian Airlines also ordered the Airbus A320 and &#x27;pictures&#x27; appeared in Australian aviation magazines advertising the paint company who were to supply the paint for the livery. The airline never took up the option on the A320 opting instead for the Boeing 737-400.

==Accidents and incidents==

===Fatal===
*On 8 August 1951 at around 9 p.m. local time, a Trans Australia Airlines Douglas C-47 Skytrain (registered VH-TAT) crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Cambridge Aerodrome for a cargo flight to Melbourne, killing the two pilots. They had lost control of the aircraft due to a severe ice build-up.
*On 31 October 1954, a Vickers Viscount (registered VH-TVA) crashed shortly after take-off from Mangalore Airport. Three of the eight crew members that had been on the training flight were killed.
*On 10 June 1960, Flight 538 from Rockhampton to Mackay, Queensland, which was operated by a Fokker F27 Friendship registered VH-TFB, crashed into the sea while approaching Mackay Airport, killing the 25 passengers and four crew on board. It was the worst accident in the history of the airline.
*On 24 May 1961, a Douglas DC-4 registered VH-TAA was destroyed when it crashed on Bulwer Island whilst on approach to Brisbane Airport, killing the two pilots that had been on the cargo flight from Sydney. The captain had suffered a heart attack and collapsed onto the throttles, and the co-pilot had thus been unable to see large trees in front of him because he could not reach the switch for the landing light.
*On 28 April 1970, a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter (registered VH-TGR) crashed shortly after take-off from an unpaved airfield near Kainantu, Papua New Guinea, killing the two pilots and six of the nine passengers on board.

===Non-fatal===

* On 29 January 1971, a Boeing 727 registered VH-TJA hit the tailfin of a Canadian Pacific Air Lines Douglas DC-8 (registered CF-CPQ) right after take-off from Sydney as Flight 592 to Perth. The DC-8 had not yet cleared the runway following its arrival. The TAA 727 suffered a gash in its fuselage, but the pilots managed to safely return the aircraft to the airport, so that there were no injuries.
*On 11 April 1972, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain (registered VH-PNB) that had been leased from Ansett, overran the runway on landing at Madang Airport, ending up in the sea damaged beyond economic repair.
*On 9 June 1982, a Fokker F27 Friendship was damaged beyond repair when it skidded off the runway upon landing at RAAF Base Amberley. The aircraft with three people on board had been on a training flight, which included a landing with one engine deliberately shut down, during which the pilot lost control.

===Criminal occurrences===
*On 19 July 1960, Flight 408 from Sydney to Brisbane, operated by a Lockheed L-188 Electra registered VH-TLB, was the subject of an attempted hijacking. An armed man demanded the flight be diverted to Singapore, but he was overpowered by the crew.
*On 8 June 1979, a hijacking attempt occurred on board a TAA McDonnell Douglas DC-9 during a flight from Coolangatta to Brisbane. The pilots landed at Brisbane Airport, where the perpetrator was arrested.
*On 21 September 1982, Trans Australia Airlines Flight 454, operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 registered VH-TJS, was the subject of an attempted robbery of $600,000 from the Reserve Bank of Australia. The robbery involved four men consigning themselves as freight, intending to steal the money during two flights of the aircraft.
*On 13 February 1983, an Airbus A300 operating Trans Australia Airlines flight 004 was hijacked en route during a flight from Perth to Melbourne. The hijacker, Clifford Watego, a 27-year old university student, demanded to be flown to Tasmania. The pilots continued to Melbourne Airport, on taxi-in the hijacker, who was on the flight deck told the crew his bomb was on a timer – the aircraft was stopped and a full evacuation followed. The hijacker was subsequently arrested. He claimed that he was trying to alert the public to &#x27;social injustices&#x27;.

<doc id="187206" wikidata="Q770689" url="?curid=187206" title="Stanley, Hong Kong">
<text>Stanley, or Chek Chue, is a coastal town and a popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong. It is located on a peninsula on Hong Kong Island. It is east of Repulse Bay and west of Shek O, adjacent to Chung Hom Kok and Tai Tam. Administratively, it is part of the Southern District.

The Chinese name &quot;Chek Chue&quot; refers to the original village-town but &quot;Stanley&quot; generally refers to all the surrounding areas of the peninsula on Hong Kong Island.
==Name==
It was given an English name after Lord Stanley (subsequently Earl of Derby), British Colonial Secretary at the time of the cession of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom, and subsequently Prime Minister.

==History==
After the annexation of Hong Kong in 1842, the British made Stanley the temporary administrative centre, before moving it to the newly founded Victoria City. Present-day Stanley Fort was where British and Canadian troops mounted a last stand during the Battle of Hong Kong. The survivors surrendered to Japanese forces in December 1941. The fort, which was the former British Army barracks in Stanley, is now occupied by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army following the handover of Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997.

==Places of interest==

===Stanley Market and Pat Kan Uk===

Stanley Market is situated in Stanley New Street near the Stanley food market. It is an array of small shops and street stalls.

===Stanley Main Street===
Stanley has many bars and restaurants on its waterfront along Stanley Main Street.

To the west of Stanley Main Street, past the amphitheatre in Stanley Plaza is the Tin Hau Temple (Temple of the Queen of Heaven). Built by Cheung Po Tsai in 1767, it is one of the oldest temples in Hong Kong.

===Murray House===
Murray House is a Victorian-era building originally built in the present-day business district of Central in 1846 as officers&#x27; quarters of the Murray Barracks, the building was relocated to Stanley during the 2000s.

===Stanley Plaza ===
Adjacent to Murray House and Lung Tak Court, Stanley Plaza opened in 2001. It includes a shopping arcade and an outdoor community amphitheatre. The complex is owned by The Link REIT. Numerous free concerts and events are held in the amphitheatre throughout the year. In November 2011, Stanley Plaza reopened after a major renovation which was part of the transfer from government ownership to Link REIT ownership. A number of Asian and western restaurants, a supermarket, Starbucks, McDonald&#x27;s and a variety of shops can be found in Stanley Plaza. Well integrated with the Stanley Main Street waterfront and historic Murray House, Stanley Plaza provides convenient access to nearby tourist spots such as Tin Hau Temple and Stanley Ma Hang Park.

===Stanley&#x27;s beaches===

Stanley is famous for its two beaches: Stanley Main Beach, located on the eastern side of the peninsula, and St. Stephen&#x27;s Beach, on the western side. Both beaches are sandy and have areas designed for barbecues. Like many beaches in Hong Kong, they also have netted perimeters to protect swimmers from sharks.

The larger of the two beaches - Stanley Main Beach, which is also popular with windsurfers and other watersport enthusiasts, hosts the Stanley Dragon Boat Championships each year in June to celebrate the Tuen Ng Festival.

There is a Water Sports Training Centre run by the Government located at Stanley Main Beach. Courses are offered at reasonable prices and are very popular.

===St. Stephen&#x27;s College===

St. Stephen&#x27;s College is a primary and secondary school that has been located in Stanley for over 100 years. It has both day students and boarding facilities. Originally a private school, St. Stephen&#x27;s College became a government-funded public school during the late 1900s.
The college&#x27;s oldest building, the School House, was declared a monument in 2011, being one of the few schools in Hong Kong to own a Declared Monument in its campus.

===Correctional Services Department (CSD) Complex===

Stanley Prison is a maximum security level correctional facility, established in 1937, that houses the most hardened of criminals from the Hong Kong Judicial System. The Pak Sha Wan Correctional Institution (a medium security institution established in 1999) and the Tung Tau Correctional Institution (a minimum security institution established in 1982) are all part of the overall Hong Kong Correctional Services Department complex in Stanley. Nearby on Stanley Village Road is the Ma Hang Prison (a minimum security institution established in 1974) which houses male adult prisoners and clinically old prisoners of low security risk.

The CSD Staff Training Institute is also located in Stanley. It is responsible for planning and implementing training programmes to equip CSD staff with relevant knowledge.

The Correctional Services Museum is located at the entrance to the CSD complex in Stanley. It is open from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm daily except Mondays and public holidays. The Museum&#x27;s collection has over 680 artefacts in nine galleries occupying some 480 square metres. Admission to the museum is free of charge.

=== Rhino Rock ===

Rhino Rock, or Che Pau Teng, is a famous landmark that&#x27;s a short hike within Stanley. The hike&#x27;s main claim to fame is the rhinoceros-shaped rock that overlooks the Correctional Services Depart Complex and the South China Sea. The trail takes just over an hour to complete. Despite its short duration, it is easy to get lost, so attempt this hike with caution.

===Ma Hang Park===

Stanley Ma Hang Park opened on 17 January 2011. The park has an area of 50,000 square-meters featuring various thematic zones to cater for people of all ages and interests. Pedestrian paths have been improved to enable safe and easy access to the various thematic zones, with display boards set up to introduce the birds, butterflies and plant species found in the park. Pak Tai Temple is also a part of the park. It was built in 1805 when Stanley was a major fishing village, and dedicated to the &quot;protector of fishermen&quot;.

<text>Austrians (, ) are the citizens and nationals of Austria. The English term &quot;Austrians&quot; was applied to the population of Habsburg Austria from the 17th or 18th century. Subsequently, during the 19th century, it referred to the citizens of the Empire of Austria (1804–1867), and from 1867 until 1918 to the citizens of Cisleithania. In the closest sense, the term &quot;Austria&quot; originally referred to the historical March of Austria, corresponding roughly to the Vienna Basin in what is today Lower Austria.

Historically, Austrians were regarded as Germans and viewed themselves as such. The Austrian lands (including Bohemia) were part of the Holy Roman Empire and the German Confederation until the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 which resulted in Prussia expelling the Austrian Empire from the Confederation. Thus, when Germany was founded as a nation-state in 1871, Austria was not a part of it. In 1867, Austria was reformed into the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 at the end of World War I, Austria was reduced to a rump state and adopted and briefly used the name the Republic of German-Austria () in an attempt for union with Germany, but was forbidden due to the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). The First Austrian Republic was founded in 1919. Nazi Germany annexed Austria with the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938.

After the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of World War II in Europe, both the political ideology of pan-Germanism and the union with Germany have become associated with Nazism, resulting in Austrians developing their own separate and distinct national identity. Today, the vast majority of Austrians do not identify as German.

==Name==

The English word &quot;Austrian&quot; is a derivative of the proper name Austria, which is a latinization of &quot;Österreich&quot;, the German name for Austria. This word is derived from &quot;Ostarrîchi&quot;, which first appears in 996. This, in turn, is probably a translation of the Latin &quot;Marcha Orientalis&quot;, which means &quot;eastern borderland&quot; (viz. delimiting the eastern border of the Holy Roman Empire). It was a margraviate of the Duchy of Bavaria, ruled by the House of Babenberg from AD 976.
During the 12th century, the &quot;Marcha Orientalis&quot; under the Babenbergs became independent of Bavaria. What is today known as Lower Austria corresponds to the &quot;Marcha Orientalis&quot;, while Upper Austria corresponds to the eastern half of the core territory of Bavaria (the western half forming part of the German state of Bavaria).

The adjective &quot;Austrian&quot; entered the English language in the early 17th century, at the time referring to Habsburg Austria in the sense of &quot;members of the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg&quot; (the junior branch emerging from the dynastic split into Austrian and Spanish Habsburgs in 1521), but from the 18th century also &quot;a native or inhabitant of Austria&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===

The territory of what is today Austria in the Roman era was divided into Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia.
Noricum was a Celtic kingdom, while the &quot;Pannonii&quot; were of Illyrian stock. The Raetians were an ancient alpine people probably akin to the Etruscans. During the Migration period (), these territories were settled by the Bavarians and other Germanic groups in the west (Alemanni in Vorarlberg, Lombards in Tyrol), and by Slavic groups (principality Carantania), Huns and Avars in the east. In the 8th century, the former territories of Raetia and Noricum fell under Carolingian rule, and were divided into the duchies of Swabia, Bavaria and principality Carantania. Pannonia until the end of the 8th century was part of the Avar Khaganate. The &quot;East March&quot; (&quot;Ostmark&quot;) during the 9th century was the boundary region separating East Francia from the Avars and the Magyars. The site of Vienna had been settled since Celtic times (as &quot;Vindobona&quot;), but the city only rose to importance in the High Middle Ages as the chief settlement of the March of Austria (the March river just east of Vienna marks the ancient border between Francia and the Avars).

After the defeat of the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955, the East March or March of Austria came to be the easternmost portion of the Holy Roman Empire, bordering on Moravia to the north and on the Kingdom of Hungary to the east.
As a consequence, the national character of the Austro-Bavarian speaking majority population of Austria throughout their early modern and modern history remained characterized by their neighbourhood to the West Slavs (Czechs, Slovaks) to the north, the South Slavs (Slovenes, Carinthian Slovenes, Burgenland Croats) to the south, and the Hungarians to the east.

The unification of the various territories of Austria outside of the March of Austria proper
(i.e. parts of Bavaria, Swabia and Carinthia) was a gradual process of feudal politics during the High and Late Middle Ages, at first in the Archduchy of Austria under the House of Babenberg during the 12th to 13th centuries, and under the House of Habsburg after 1278 and throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. The various populations of these territories were not unified under the single name of &quot;Austrians&quot; before the early modern period.

===Early modern period===

The Habsburg, who had ruled the territory of Austria since the Late Middle Ages, greatly increased their political prestige and power with the acquisition of the lands of the crowns of Hungary and Bohemia in 1526. The Hungarian aristocracy was more successful at retaining the Magyars&#x27; cultural and political preponderance in multi-ethnic Hungary than Bohemia, on three sides surrounded by German neighbours, which underwent a period of intense German colonisation, germanizing the leading classes of the Czech people as well. The common German identity of lands such as Carinthia, Styria, or Tyrol, and the ruling dynasty made it easier for these lands to accept the central government set up in Vienna in the mid-18th century.

The term Austrian in these times was used for identifying subjects of the Domus Austriae, the House of Austria, as the dynasty was called in Europe, regardless of their ethnic ancestry. Although not formally a united state, the lands ruled by the Habsburgs would sometimes be known by the name &quot;Austria&quot;. In reality they remained a disparate range of semi-autonomous states, most of which were part of the complex network of states that was the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial institutions of which were themselves controlled for much of their later existence by the Habsburgs). However, the second half of the 18th century saw an increasingly centralised state begin to develop under the reign of Maria Theresa of Austria and her son Joseph II.

After the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon, the emperor Franz II formally founded the Austrian Empire in 1804 and became as &quot;Franz I&quot; the first Austrian emperor. For the first time the citizens of the various territories were now subjects of the one same state, while most of the German states, Prussia excluded, still cultivated their Kleinstaaterei and did not succeed in forming a homogenous empire. Following Prussia&#x27;s victory in the Austro-Prussian war in 1866, Otto von Bismarck successfully unified the German Empire in 1871, which was Prussian-dominated, without the inclusion of Austria and the German Austrians.

After Austria was excluded from Germany in 1866, the following year Austria joined Hungary as a dual empire known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. A further major change resulted from a reorganisation of the Austrian Empire in 1867 into a dual monarchy, acknowledging the Kingdom of Hungary as an independent state bound to the remaining part of the empire, as well independent, by a personal and real union, the Emperor of Austria being the Apostolic King of Hungary (with both titles on the same level). The Austrian half, a patchwork of crown-lands, broadly coterminous with the modern-day Austria, the Czech Republic, and parts of Slovenia, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, and Croatia, was bound together by the common constitution of 1867, stating that all subjects now would carry &quot;uniform Austrian citizenship&quot; and have the same fundamental rights. These non-Hungarian lands were not officially called the Austrian Empire. Until 1915, they were officially called &quot;the Kingdoms and States Represented in the Imperial Council&quot; and politicians used the technical term Cisleithania (labelling the Hungarian lands as Transleithania). The general public called them Austria, and in 1915, the non-parliamentary Cisleithanian government decreed to use this term officially, too.

===19th-century nationalism===

The idea of grouping all Germans into one nation-state gave way to a rapid rise of German nationalism within the German Confederation, especially in the two most powerful German states, Austria and Prussia. The question of how a unified Germany was to be formed was a matter of debate. The German Question was to be solved by either unifying all German-speaking peoples under one state as the &quot;Greater German solution&quot; (&quot;Großdeutsche Lösung&quot;), which was promoted by the Austrian Empire and its supporters. On the other hand, the &quot;Lesser German solution&quot; (&quot;Kleindeutsche Lösung&quot;) advocated only to unify the northern German states and exclude Austria; this proposal was favored by the Kingdom of Prussia and its supporters. This debate became known as German dualism.

The lands later called Cisleithania (except Galicia and Dalmatia) were members of the German Confederation since 1815 as they had been part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1806. Until 1848, Austria and its chancellor Prince Metternich unanimously dominated the confederation. The developing sense of a German nationality had been accelerated massively as a consequence of the political turmoil and wars that engulfed Central Europe following the French Revolution and the rise to power of Napoleon Bonaparte. Although the years of peace after Napoleon&#x27;s fall quickly saw German nationalism largely pushed out of the public political arena by reactionary absolutism, the Revolutions of 1848 established it as a significant political issue for a period of nearly hundred years.

Political debate now centred on the nature of a possible future German state to replace the Confederation, and part of that debate concerned the issue of whether or not the Austrian lands had a place in the German polity. When Emperor Franz Joseph I ordered to build a monument in Vienna in 1860 to Archduke Charles, victor over Napoleon in the Battle of Aspern-Essling in 1809, it carried the dedication &quot;To the persistent fighter for Germany&#x27;s honour&quot;, to underline the Germanic mission of the House of Austria.

The idea of uniting all ethnic Germans into one nation-state began to be challenged in Austria by the rise of Austrian nationalism, especially within the Christian Social Party that identified Austrians on the basis of their predominantly Catholic religious identity as opposed to the predominantly Protestant religious identity of the Prussians.

Habsburg influence over the German Confederation, which was strongest in the southern member states, was rivalled by the increasingly powerful Prussian state. Political manoeuvering by the Prussian chancellor Otto von Bismarck resulted in military defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the collapse of the Confederation, both effectively ending any future Austrian influence on German
political events.

When asked by Edward VII to abandon Austria-Hungary&#x27;s alliance with Germany for co-operation with England, Franz Joseph replied &quot;I am a German prince.&quot;

The Franco-Prussian War and the establishment of a German Empire in 1871, headed by Prussia and pointedly excluding any of the Austrian lands, let the state turn away from Germany and turn its gaze towards the Balkan Peninsula. Thereby the influence of pan-Germanism was diminished in the Habsburg territories, but as the term &quot;Austrians&quot; still was used supra-national, German-speaking Austrians considered themselves Germans (and were counted as such in the censuses). After Bismarck had excluded Austria from Germany, many Austrians faced a dilemma about their identity which prompted the Social Democratic Leader Otto Bauer to state that the dilemma was &quot;the conflict between our Austrian and German character.&quot; The state as a whole tried to work out a sense of a distinctively Austrian identity.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire created ethnic conflict between the German Austrians and the other ethnic groups of the empire. Many pan-German movements in the empire desired the reinforcement of an ethnic German identity and that the empire would collapse and allow for a quick annexation of Austria to Germany. Although it was precisely because of Bismarck&#x27;s policies that Austria and the German Austrians were excluded from Germany, many Austrian pan-Germans idolized him.

While the high bureaucracy of Austria and many Austrian army officers considered themselves &quot;black-yellow&quot; (the Habsburg colours), i.e. loyal to the dynasty, the term &quot;German Austria&quot; (Deutschösterreich) was a term used in the press to mean all the Austrian districts with an ethnic German majority among the inhabitants. Austrian pan-Germans such as Georg Ritter von Schönerer and his followers agitated against the &quot;multi-national&quot; Austro-Hungarian Empire and advocated for German Austria to join the German Empire. Although many Austrians shared the same views, a lot of them still showed allegiance to the Habsburg monarchy and hoped for Austria to remain an independent country. Although not as radical as Schönerer and his followers, populists such as Karl Lueger used anti-semitism and pan-Germanism as a form of populism to further their own political purposes.

===World Wars===

The last year of World War I saw the collapse of Habsburg authority throughout an increasingly greater part of its empire. On October 16, 1918, emperor Karl I invited the nations of Austria to create national councils, with the aim to instigate a restructuring of the state under Habsburg rule. The nations followed the invitation (the Czechs had founded their national council already before the invitation) but ignored the will of the emperor to keep them in a restructured Austrian state. Their goal was total independence.
On October 21, the German members of the Austrian parliament, elected in 1911, met in Vienna to found the Provisional National Assembly of German Austria (&quot;Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich&quot;). On October 30, 1918, they installed the first German Austrian government, leaving the question &quot;monarchy or republic&quot; open. (German nationalists and social democrats favoured the republic, the Christian Socialists wanted to keep the monarchy.) This government in the first days of November took over the duties of the last imperial-royal government in a peaceful way. Initially the new state adopted the name &quot;German Austria&quot;, reflecting the republic being the German part of the old Austria and showing the popular desire to unite with the new German republic. On November 12, 1918, the provisional national assembly voted for the republic and for unification with Germany with a large majority.
The creation of the Czecho-Slovak and South Slav states, the dissolution of the real union with Hungary, and the post-war treaties imposed by the victorious Allies combined to see the newly established Austrian republic both with the boundaries it has today, and a largely homogeneous German-speaking population. In the Treaty of Saint-Germain, in September 1919 the union with Germany was prohibited, and the new republic&#x27;s name &quot;Deutschösterreich&quot; was prohibited by the treaty; instead the term &quot;Republic of Austria&quot; was used. The westernmost province Vorarlberg&#x27;s wish to unite with Switzerland was also ignored. On October 21, 1919, the state changed its name accordingly. Many German Austrian communities were left scattered throughout the other new states, especially in Czechoslovakia, where more than 3 million German Bohemians had not been allowed to become part of the new Austrian state, as well as in the southern part of Tyrol which now found itself part of Italy. In total, more than 3.5 million German-speaking Austrians were forced to remain outside the Austrian state.

The collapse of the empire caused an apparent struggle for some German Austrians between an &quot;Austrian&quot; and a &quot;German&quot; character. The idea of unifying Austria with Germany was motivated both by a sense of a common German national identity, and also by a fear that the new state, stripped of its one-time imperial possessions, and surrounded by potentially hostile nation-states, would not be economically viable. An Austrian identity emerged to some degree during the First Republic, and although Austria was still considered part of the &quot;German nation&quot; by most, Austrian patriotism was encouraged by the anti-Nazi/anti-Socialist clerico-authoritarianist state ideology known as Austrofascism from 1934 to 1938. The Engelbert Dollfuss/Kurt von Schuschnigg government accepted that Austria was a &quot;German state&quot; and believed Austrians were &quot;better Germans&quot;, but strongly opposed the annexing of Austria to Nazi Germany.
By March 1938, with Nazi governments in control of both Berlin and Vienna, the country was annexed to Germany (&quot;Anschluss&quot;) as &quot;Ostmark&quot;. In 1942 the name was changed to the &quot;Alpen-und Donau-Reichsgaue&quot; (&quot;Alpine and Danubian Gaue&quot;), thus eradicating any links with a special Austrian past. Some of the most prominent Nazis were native Austrians, including Adolf Hitler, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Franz Stangl, Otto Skorzeny, and Odilo Globocnik, as were 40% of the staff at Nazi extermination camps.

During the war, Austrians&#x27; infatuation with Germany faded as Austrian-born Hitler&#x27;s series of victories ended. When social democrat Adolf Schärf, from 1945 party president and vice-chancellor and from 1957 federal president of Austria, was visited by German friends who wanted to talk about post-war government, he spontaneously explained to his surprised visitors, &quot;love for Germany has been put out in Austrians&quot;. When the allies declared that they would reestablish an independent Austrian state after their victory (the Moscow Declaration of 1943) the only Austrians who heard them were those secretly listening to enemy broadcasts (&quot;Feindsender&quot;), which was a criminal offence and heavily prosecuted.

Though the Allied forces treated Austria as a belligerent party in the war and maintained occupation of it after the Nazi capitulation, they accepted the Declaration of Independence which Austrian politicians had signed at Vienna&#x27;s city hall on April 27, 1945, and they made the first national elections possible in the autumn of that year. By the end of 1945, Austria, under the supervision of the Allied Council in Vienna, had a democratic parliament and government again, acknowledged by all four allied occupation zones.

The Austrian resistance to the Nazi rule started with the Anschluss in 1938. Historians estimate that there were about 100,000 members of resistance facing 700,000 NSDAP members in Austria. The sign of the Austrian resistance was O5, where the 5 stands for E and OE is the abbreviation of Österreich with Ö as OE.

===Republic of Austria (1955 to present)===

The end of World War II in 1945 saw the re-establishment of an independent Austria, although the Allied Powers remained in occupation until 1955, when the Austrian State Treaty between Austria and them was signed to end occupation and to regain Austrian sovereignty.
Immediately after 1945 the majority of Austrians still saw themselves as Germans, as a broader Austrian national identity took time to develop. In a 1956 survey, 46% of Austrians still considered themselves to be Germans. Another survey carried out in 1964 revealed that only 15% of Austrians still considered themselves to be Germans.

In contrast, the Austrian political elite referred to their experiences in concentration camps and in prison, which had brought out a desire for the lost independence of the Austrian state. Kreissler (1993) writes: &quot;It was not until after the (long dark) night of the Third Reich that Austrian identity was brought back to consciousness by resistance and exile&quot;.
Austrians developed a self-image unambiguously separate from their German neighbour. It was based on cultural achievements of the past, the Moscow Declaration, geopolitical neutrality, language variation, the Habsburg legacy, and the separation of the two empires in the late 19th century. The German Empire was formed without Austria and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the arrangement known as the Kleindeutsche Lösung or &quot;the Little Germany Solution&quot;. It proved favourable for Austrians not to be held guilty for World War II, genocide and war crimes, since Austria was considered a &quot;victim&quot; of Nazi Germany, although some historians call this a &quot;big lie&quot; and have challenged this statement.

Unlike earlier in the 20th century, in 1987 only 6% of Austrians identified themselves as &quot;Germans&quot;. Today over 90% of the Austrians see themselves as an independent nation.
The logic of the existence of an independent Austrian state is no longer questioned as it was in the inter-war period. Proponents who recognize Austrians as a nation claim that Austrians have Celtic heritage, as Austria is the location of the first characteristically Celtic culture to exist. It is said that Celtic Austria became culturally Romanized under Roman rule and later culturally Germanized after Germanic invasions. Contemporary Austrians express pride in having Celtic heritage and Austria possesses one of the largest collections of Celtic artifacts in Europe.

Austria&#x27;s multicultural history and geographical location has resulted in post-Soviet era immigration from Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Poland. As with neighbouring Germany, there has also been heavy immigration from Turkey and former Yugoslav states such as Croatia and Serbia.

==Language==
Austrians have historically spoken the German language. The sole official language at the federal level of Austria is German, and the standard used is called Austrian German since German is considered a pluricentric language, like English. Austrian German is defined by the Austrian Dictionary (), published under the authority of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture. Thus, all websites, official announcements and most of the media are carried out in Austrian German. In terms of native language, it is generally not Austrian German that is used, but instead local dialects of the Austro-Bavarian and Allemannic (in Vorarlberg and the Tiroler Außerfern) family. The Austro-Bavarian dialects are considered to belong either to the Central Austro-Bavarian or Southern Austro-Bavarian subgroups, with the latter encompassing the languages of the Tyrol, Carinthia, and Styria and the former including the dialects of Vienna, Burgenland, Upper Austria, and Lower Austria. The vast majority of Austrians are however able to speak Austrian Standard German in addition to their native dialect, as it is taught in all modern day schools.

The minority languages Slovene, Croatian and Hungarian are spoken and officially recognized by some states of Austria.

==Naturalization==
Like most of Central Europe, Austria has had high levels of immigration since the 1970s. As with Germany, the largest immigrant group are Turks. An estimated total of 350,000 ethnic Turks lived in Austria in 2010, accounting for 3% of the Austrian population.

The rate of naturalization has increased after 1995, since which dates Turks in Austria could retain their citizenship in Turkey after naturalization in Austria (dual citizenship). After 2007, the rate of naturalizations has decreased due to a stricter nationality law enacted by the Austrian legislature.
During the 2000s, an average number of 27,127 foreign nationals per year was naturalized as Austrian citizens, compared to an average 67,688 children per year born with Austrian nationality.

Today, the largest group of foreign nationals are Germans. As of January 2018 - 186,891 Germans lived in Austria.

==Culture==
===Music===
Vienna, the capital city of Austria has long been an important center of musical innovation. Composers of the 18th and 19th centuries were drawn to the city by the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert and Johann Strauss, Jr., among others, were associated with the city. During the Baroque period, Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.

===Literature===

Complementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Thomas Bernhard, and Robert Musil, and of poets Georg Trakl, Franz Werfel, Franz Grillparzer, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Adalbert Stifter. Famous contemporary Austrian playwrights and novelists include Elfriede Jelinek and Peter Handke. Writers of philosophy include Ernst Mach, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Karl Popper and the members of the Vienna circle.

===Cuisine===
Austrian cuisine, which is often incorrectly equated with Viennese cuisine, is derived from the cuisine of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In addition to native regional traditions it has been influenced above all by German, Hungarian, Czech, Jewish, Italian and Polish cuisines, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. Goulash is one example of this. Austrian cuisine is known primarily in the rest of the world for its pastries and sweets.

===Religion===
The majority of Austrians are traditionally Catholic. Catholicism in Austria has played a significant role both in the culture and in the politics of Austria. It enabled the House of Habsburg to rule Spain and its empire as a Catholic Monarchy from the 16th century, and it determined the role of Habsburg Austria in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The music in the tradition of Viennese classicism is sacral to a significant extent, including works such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Great Mass in C minor, Joseph Haydn&#x27;s masses (1750-1802), Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Mass in C major (1807), down to Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Te Deum (1903).

Secularism has been on the rise since the 1980s. An estimated 66% of Austrians adhered to Roman Catholicism in 2009, compared to 78% in 1991 and 89% in 1961. There is a traditional Lutheran minority, accounting for 4% of the population in 2009 (down from 6% in 1961). An estimated 17% are nonreligious (as of 2005).

Islam in Austria has grown rapidly during the 1990s and 2000s, rising from 0.8% in 1971 to an estimated 6% in 2010, overtaking the traditional size of the Lutheran community in Austria. This rapid growth was due to the significant immigration to Austria from Turkey and Yugoslavia during the 1990s to 2000s.

<text>[[Tourism]] in [[Singapore]] is a major industry and contributor to the Singaporean economy. In 2019, 19,114,002 tourists visited the country, which was the highest recorded number of arrivals since independence in 1965. As of 2023, as tourist arrivals recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were a total of 13,610,404 international tourists that have visited Singapore, which was more than twice the country&#x27;s total population.

The country is marketed as a &quot;City In Nature&quot; destination by the Singapore Tourism Board under its &#x27;Made in Singapore&#x27; campaign in 2023, with sustainable tourism as part of the campaign efforts. It also claims to be environmentally friendly, and maintains natural and heritage conservation programs. Along with this, it also has one of the world&#x27;s lowest crime rates. As English is the dominant one of its four official languages, it is generally easier for tourists to understand when speaking to the local population of the country, for example, when shopping. Transport in Singapore exhaustively covers most, if not all public venues in Singapore, which increases convenience for tourists. This includes the well-known Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system. Singapore is the 5th most visited city in the world, and 2nd in Asia-Pacific.

The &quot;Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017&quot; ranks Singapore 13th out of 136 countries overall, which was the third best in Asia only behind Japan (ranked 4th) and Hong Kong (ranked 11th). The report ranks Singapore&#x27;s business environment, international openness, also travel and tourism policy and enabling conditions as the best in the world (ranked 1st). However, the island nation scored rather low in natural and cultural resources sub-index (ranked 40th).

==History==

In January 1964, the Singapore Tourism Board (then known as Singapore Tourist Promotion Board), was set up to market Singapore, then a state of Malaysia, as a destination for tourists, to develop and to regulate the tourism industry. The Government of Singapore had aimed to create more jobs, income and to facilitate trade within Singapore, through the development of the tourism industry. Throughout the 1960s to 70s, the tourism board ran multiple advertising campaigns aimed at drawing visitors from different countries and published monthly newsletters to promote multiple attractions in Singapore. The Merlion was also created as the Singapore Tourism Board&#x27;s logo in 1964 and was used in promotional materials. The Merlion eventually became a well-known Singaporean icon and in 1972, a Merlion statue was erected in the Merlion Park. In 1977, there was a record of 1.5 million visitors to the country and tourist receipts were estimated to be S$628 million as compared to 522,000 visitors and S$269 million in tourist expenditure in 1970.

Throughout the 1980s to 1990s, the tourism board aimed to market the culture of Singapore to visitors through the renewal of infrastructure in historical areas such as Chinatown and development of new venues for hosting concerts and conventions. In 2005, the government of Singapore announced the development of 2 integrated resorts in Marina South and Sentosa. Plans to develop Gardens by the Bay were also announced in that same year. The resorts were part of plans to boost the tourism industry which had been facing intense competition from other destinations around the region, particularly from nearby Bangkok and Hong Kong, which has since also considered legalisation of casinos in the wake of initiatives in Singapore. Marina Bay Sands was officially opened on 23 June 2010, while Gardens by the Bay opened on June 29, 2012 and Resorts World Sentosa was officially opened on December 7, 2012.

==Tourism statistics==
Visitor arrivals to Singapore has been increasing since the country&#x27;s independence in 1965. As compared to a total of 99,000 visitors recorded in 1965, Singapore attracted approximately 19.1 million visitors in 2019 with receipts at S$27.7 billion, according to preliminary figures by the Singapore Tourism Board. The total number of visitors increased by 3.3% from 2018, with increased in arrivals in visitors from China, Indonesia and Australia, while visitors from India and Malaysia dropped 2% and 3% respectively. Tourism receipts increased 2.8% from 2018, with most visitors spending in the sightseeing, entertainment and gaming (S$1,593 million), shopping (S$1,457 million), accommodation (S$1,439 million) and food &amp; beverage (S$649 million) categories.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, visitor statistics in Singapore fell 85.7% and tourism receipts fell 82.6% (S$4.8 million) from 2019. A total of 2,700,000 visitors were recorded that year, which was the first time visitor statistics fell since the decrease in arrivals in 2014. Visitors coming into Singapore for short-term visits were also barred from entering and transiting from March 23, 2020 to October 19, 2021.

In 2021, visitors arrivals further dipped to 330,059 visitors, which was a 88% decrease as compared to 2020. In December 2021, amid the spread of the highly transmissible COVID-19 Omicron variant, many countries still had travel restrictions, with some governments banning travel completely to curb transmission. Travel into Singapore for short-term visits were only resumed in September 2021 with the introduction of vaccinated travel lanes.

====Tourism impact of COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021)====
In early 2020, COVID-19 pandemic has affected the numbers of foreign visitors across the country. In February 2020, Indonesia raised its travel alert for Singapore to level yellow, urging Indonesian citizens to take extra precautions when they visit the city-state. Indonesia is among the top source of foreign visitors to Singapore. It is predicted that the number of visitors could fall between 25 and 30 per cent from the 2019 figure.

On 16 September 2020, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing has announced that all adult Singaporeans will get $100 tourism vouchers, accessible digitally via Singpass, to be used from December 2020 to June 2021. The $320 million SingapoRediscovers Vouchers scheme is part of the government&#x27;s effort to prop up the tourism sector, which has been decimated by travel restrictions amidst COVID-19 pandemic.

The tourist island of Sentosa, which attracted 19 million visitors in 2011, is located in the south of Singapore, consists of about 20–30 landmarks, such as Fort Siloso, which was built as a fortress to defend against the Japanese during World War II. Guns from the World War II era can be seen at Fort Siloso, from a mini-sized to a 16 pound (7 kg) gun. Moreover, the island has built the Tiger Sky Tower, which allows visitors to view the whole of Sentosa, as well as the Sentosa Luge, a small one- or two-person sled on which one sleighs supine and feet-first. Steering is done by shifting the weight or pulling straps attached to the sled&#x27;s runners.

The Singapore Zoo displays animals in &#x27;open&#x27; naturalistic, spacious, landscaped enclosures separated from the visitors by hidden barriers, moats, and glass, with various shows and events occurring throughout the day to allow visitors to interact with the animals. Night Safari is the world&#x27;s first nocturnal zoo, set in a humid tropical forest that is only open at night, it is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram.

Among the various gardens and parks located in the country, Singapore&#x27;s Singapore Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay are most popular amongst tourists. The Singapore Botanical Gardens, a UNESCO World Heritage Site is a 52 hectares tropical garden, among its main attractions includes the National Orchid collection with over 3000 types of orchids growing. Gardens by the Bay, designed as a series of large tropical leaf-shaped gardens, each with its own specific landscaping design, character and theme.

The island forms part of the Ubin–Khatib Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of visiting and resident birds, some of which are threatened. One of the more popular spots on the island is, Chek Jawa, a previous coral reef 5000 years ago, where several ecosystems can be observed in one area.

==Dining==
The cuisine of Singapore is often viewed by its population as a prime example of the ethnic diversity of the culture of Singapore. In Singapore&#x27;s hawker centres – a technical misnomer, to be precise – for example, traditionally Malay hawker stalls selling halal food may serve halal versions of traditionally Tamil or Chinese food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay or Indian ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering. Some dishes introduce elements from all three cultures, while others incorporate influences from the rest of Asia and the West.

This phenomenon makes the cuisine of Singapore significantly rich and a cultural attraction. Much prepared food is available in the hawker centres or food courts (e.g. Lau Pa Sat, Newton Food Centre) rather than actual restaurants. These centres are relatively abundant which often leads to low prices, and encourages a large consumer base.

Food in itself has been heavily promoted as an attraction for tourists, and is usually promoted by various initiatives undertaken by the Singapore Tourism Board or the associations it deals with as one of Singapore&#x27;s best attractions alongside shopping. The government organises the Singapore Food Festival in July annually to celebrate Singapore&#x27;s cuisine. The multiculturalism of local food, the ready availability of international cuisine, and their wide range in prices to fit all budgets at all times of the day and year helps create a &quot;food paradise&quot; to rival other contenders claiming the same moniker. The availability of variety of food is often aided by the fact Singapore&#x27;s port lies along strategic routes. Catherine Ling of &quot;CNN&quot; listed Fish soup bee hoon, Bak kut teh, Chilli crab, Nasi Padang, Hainanese chicken rice, and Kaya toast as some of the &quot;40 Singapore foods we can&#x27;t live without&quot;.

There is also a proliferation of fast-food chains, such as McDonald&#x27;s, Pizza Hut, KFC, Burger King, Subway, Long John Silver&#x27;s, Mos Burger, Five Guys and Shake Shack.

Halal and vegetarian food are also easily available.

==Tourist events==

Singapore Tourism Board promotes a variety of events all year round for tourists. Some of the anchor events are the Chingay Parade, Singapore Arts Festival and Singapore Garden Festival.
The Singapore Food Festival is held every July to celebrate Singapore&#x27;s cuisine. Other annual events include the Singapore Sun Festival, the Christmas Light Up, and the Singapore Jewel Festival.
Since 2008, Singapore has hosted the Singapore Grand Prix, part of the FIA Formula One World Championship. The inaugural race, held on a new street circuit at Marina Bay, was the first night-time event in Formula One history. The race was not held in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2010, Singapore hosted the inaugural Youth Olympic Games, where the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said the Games is expected to generate a minimum of 180,000 visitor nights for Singapore.

<text>The Kerch Strait is a strait in Eastern Europe. It connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, separating the Kerch Peninsula of Crimea in the west from the Taman Peninsula of Russia&#x27;s Krasnodar Krai in the east. The strait is to wide and up to deep. The most important harbor, the Crimean city of Kerch, gives its name to the strait, formerly known as the Cimmerian Bosporus or Straits of Taman. It has also been called the Straits of Yenikale after the Yeni-Kale fortress in Kerch. 

Taman, the most important settlement on the Taman Peninsula side of the strait, sits on Taman Bay, which is separated from the main Kerch Strait by the Chushka Spit to the north and the former Tuzla Spit to the south; the Tuzla Spit is now Tuzla Island, connected to the Taman Peninsula by a 2003 Russian-built dam, and to mainland Crimea by the Crimean Bridge opened in 2018. A major cargo port is under construction near Taman.

==History==
===Greek and Roman records===

The straits are about long and are wide at the narrowest and separate an eastern extension of Crimea from Taman, the westernmost extension of the Caucasus Mountains. In antiquity, there seem to have been a group of islands intersected by arms of the Kuban River (&quot;Hypanis&quot;) and various sounds which have since silted up. The Romans knew the strait as the Cimmerian Bosporus (&#x27;) from its Greek name, the Cimmerian Strait&quot;&#x27; (, &quot;Kimmérios Bosporos&quot;), which honored the Cimmerians, nearby steppe nomads. In ancient times the low-lying land near the Strait was known as the Maeotic Swamp.

The Cimmerian Bosporus in ancient times was regarded as separating Europe from Asia, just as the Thracian Bosporus did. Most geographers, such as Posidonius, Strabo (&quot;Geographica&quot; 11.7.4), and Ptolemy, considered the boundary between Europe and Asia to be the river Tanais (Don), which flows into the Sea of Azov from the north; an alternative view, found in the poet Cornelius Gallus was that it was the river Hypanis (Kuban), which flows into the Sea of Azov from the east, close to the Cimmerian Bosporus.

===Early modern period===

The Kerch Strait was a nearby site of a major naval battle (that became known as the Battle of Kerch Strait) in the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792). It was fought in 1790 and ended in Russian victory.

===Second World War===
In the Second World War, the Kerch Peninsula became the scene of much desperate combat between forces of the Soviet Red Army and Nazi Germany. Fighting frequency intensified in the coldest months of year when the strait froze over, allowing the movement of troops over the ice.

After the Eastern Front stabilized in early 1943, Hitler ordered the construction of a road-and-rail bridge across the Strait of Kerch in the spring of 1943 to support his desire for a renewed offensive to the Caucasus. The cable railway (aerial tramway), which went into operation on 14 June 1943 with a daily capacity of one thousand tons, was only adequate for the defensive needs of the Seventeenth Army in the Kuban bridgehead. Because of frequent earth tremors, this bridge would have required vast quantities of extra-strength steel girders, and their transport would have curtailed shipments of military material to the Crimea. The bridge was never completed, and the Wehrmacht finished evacuating the Kuban bridgehead in September 1943.

In 1944 the Soviets built a &quot;provisional&quot; railway bridge (Kerch railway bridge) across the strait. Construction made use of supplies captured from the Germans. The bridge went into operation in November 1944, but moving ice floes destroyed it in February 1945; reconstruction was not attempted.

===Post-war ferry service===

After the war, ferry transportation across the strait was established in 1954, connecting Crimea and the Krasnodar Krai (Port Krym – Port Kavkaz line). Originally there were four train ferry ships; later three car-ferry ships were added. Train transportation continued for almost 40 years. The aging train-ferries became obsolete in the late 1980s and were removed from service. In the autumn of 2004, new ships were delivered as replacements and train transportation was re-established. The ferry line stopped operations in late 2020.

===Dispute and naval treaty of 2003=== 
A territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine in 2003 centred on Tuzla Island in the Strait of Kerch. Ukraine and Russia agreed to treat the strait and the Azov Sea as shared internal waters.

===Storm of November 2007===

On Sunday, 11 November 2007, news agencies reported a very strong storm on the Black Sea. Four ships sank, six ran aground on a sandbank, and two tankers were damaged, resulting in a major oil spill and the death of 23 sailors.

The Russian oil tanker sought shelter in the Kerch Strait from the above storm. In the storm, the tanker broke in two, releasing more than 2,000 tonnes of fuel oil. Four other ships sank in the storm, resulting in the release of sulphur cargo. The storm hampered efforts to rescue crew members.
Another victim of the storm, the Russian cargo ship &quot;Volnogorsk&quot;, loaded with sulphur, sank at Port Kavkaz on the same day.

===Russo-Ukrainian War since 2014===
Russia and Ukraine agreed to guarantee each other freedom of navigation for ships of both nations in a 2003 naval treaty.
Since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War and the annexation of Crimea in 2014, however, Russian forces have forcibly established a new status quo, now being the straits&#x27; sole controlling power.

====New bridge and naval blockade====
Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov campaigned for a highway bridge to be constructed across the strait. Since 1944, various bridge projects to span the strait have been proposed or attempted, always hampered by the difficult geologic and geographic configuration of the area. Construction of an approach was actually started in 2003 with the -long dam, provoking the 2003 Tuzla Island conflict.

After the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea the government of Russia decided to build a bridge across the Kerch Strait. The 19-kilometre Crimean Bridge opened to road traffic in 2018 and the rail section opened in 2019.

Russian state-backed media claims that construction of the bridge caused increases in nutrients and planktons in the waters, attracting large numbers of fish and more than 1,000 endangered Black Sea bottlenose dolphins. However, Ukraine claims that the acoustic noise and pollution from both the bridge construction and military exercises may actually be killing Black Sea dolphins.

====Kerch Strait incident (2018)====

When two Ukrainian navy vessels tried to pass under the bridge to reach Mariupol in November 2018, Russian forces responded by blocking the straits with a large container ship. Upon turning back, the Ukrainian ships and crews were fired upon and seized by the Russian coast guard.

====2019 gas tanker disaster====

Two gas carriers collided and exploded in 2019, killing 14 people.

====2021 closure by Russia====
On 15 April 2021 Russia decided to close the area of Kerch Strait to &quot;warships and other state vessels&quot; from 24 April to 31 October. The stated rationale for the closure are military exercises. The closure partially cut off the Ukrainian ports of Berdyansk and Mariupol from the Black Sea. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry protested against the decision, stating that &quot;such actions by the Russian Federation are another attempt to violate the norms and principles of international law to usurp the sovereign rights of Ukraine as a coastal state, as Ukraine has the right to regulate navigation in these areas of the Black Sea&quot;. According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, the decision is a violation of the freedom of navigation under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

The decision to close the strait was preceded by Russia&#x27;s warning the United States after the Biden administration&#x27;s plan to send two destroyers (USS &quot;Roosevelt&quot; and USS &quot;Donald Cook&quot;) to the Black Sea amid Russia&#x27;s increasing military presence near Ukraine. The Biden administration withheld the destroyers after fighting intensified between Ukrainian and Russian-backed separatist forces in an effort to alleviate the tension. Putin had threatened the safety of the US Navy ships, saying that they should stay away from the area “for their own good”. After the destroyers were withheld, Russia took advantage of the opening to close the Kerch Strait.

====2021 &quot;Donbas&quot; incident====
On 9 December 2021 left Mariupol and approached Kerch Strait. It did not give a notice in advance to pass the strait, and was warned by Russian coastguard such a notice should be given for the safety of maritime traffic. At the moment about 80 civilian ships were waiting to pass the strait.

====Crimean Bridge explosions====

In the morning of 8 October 2022 at 06:07 (Moscow time), an explosion occurred on the road portion of the Crimean Bridge, causing major damage. Seven fuel cars of a passing railway train also ignited, causing an extensive fire on the parallel rail bridge, and two half-sections of the road bridge collapsed. On 17 July 2023, two suicide sea drones exploded underneath and damaged a span of the road bridge.

====Crimean tunnel====
In late 2023 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Russia, with the help of Chinese companies, was contemplating building a Crimean tunnel.

====2024 oil spill====

On 15 December 2024, the Russian oil tankers and were damaged in a storm in the Kerch Strait, resulting in an oil spill. &quot;Volgoneft-212&quot;, which was carrying about 4,900 tonnes of oil, split in two, and the bow section sank. One crew member died of hypothermia, and the remaining 12 crew members were taken to hospital. &quot;Volgoneft-239&quot;, which was carrying about 4,300 tonnes of oil, became uncontrollable; drifted; and ran aground near the Port of Taman, Krasnodar Krai.

Efforts to rescue the crew of &quot;Volgoneft-239&quot; were suspended overnight due to bad weather, but all crew members were rescued the next day. It was also found that day that &quot;Volgoneft-239&quot; had begun leaking oil after she ran aground, but both leaks stopped that day. Oil spills from both ships began drifting towards the coast northwest of the port of Taman between the Tuzla Spit and Cape Panagiya.

==Kerch–Yenikale Canal==
In order to improve navigational capabilities of the Strait of Kerch, which is quite shallow in its narrowest point, the Kerch–Yenikale Canal was dredged through the strait. The main channel can accommodate vessels up to 215 meters long with a draft of up to 8 meters with a compulsory pilot assistance. The canal is not straight, and its geometry further complicates safe navigation. The narrowness, limited depth, and turns of the main channel together with the often unpredictable effects of wind and visibility (fog) mean that there are strict procedures regulating strait transit. Transit of large vessels occurs on a one-way (alternating) group convoy basis. Transit procedures have remained unchanged, whether under Soviet, Ukrainian, or Russian jurisdiction. The Vessel Traffic Control Post in Kerch controls and oversees all traffic.

==Fishing==
Several fish-processing plants are located on the Crimean coast of the strait. The fishing season begins in late autumn and lasts for 2 to 3 months, when many seiners put out into the strait to fish. The Taman Bay is a major fishing ground, with many fishing villages scattered along the coast.

<text>The Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas (; &quot;Botafogo Football and Rowing&quot;) is a Brazilian sports club based in the neighborhood of Botafogo, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Although it competes in a number of different sports, Botafogo is mostly known for its association football team. It plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system, and in the state of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s premier state league. In 2000, Botafogo finished 12th in a vote by subscribers of &quot;FIFA Magazine&quot; for the FIFA Club of the Century. In 2024, Botafogo was recognized by the IFFHS as the Best Club in South America and the 5th Best Club in the World. The club is among Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Big 12 Clubs&quot; having won the Brazilian Championship three times (1968, 1995, 2024), the Copa CONMEBOL Libertadores in 2024, and the Copa CONMEBOL in 1993.

In addition, the Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas has some of Brazilian football&#x27;s most notable records, including most unbeaten matches: 52 games between 1977 and 1978; the most unbeaten matches in the Brazilian Championship: 42, also between 1977 and 1978; and the most players called up to the Brazilian national team in World Cups. The club holds the record for the greatest victory ever recorded in Brazilian football: 24–0 against Sport Club Mangueira in 1909.

==History==
===Formation and merger===
On 1 July 1894, the Club de Regatas Botafogo was founded in Rio de Janeiro as a rowing club.

On 12 August 1904, another club was founded in the neighborhood: the Electro Club, the name first given to the Botafogo Football Club. The idea came during an algebra lesson at Alfredo Gomes College. The Electro Club was founded, but its name did not last. After a suggestion from Dona Chiquitota, Flávio&#x27;s grandmother, the club finally became the Botafogo Football Club, on its 18 September. The colors were black and white like those of Juventus FC, the team of Itamar Tavares, one of the club&#x27;s founders. Its badge was drawn by Basílio Vianna Jr., in Swiss style with the BFC monogram. The Botafogo Football Club would soon become one of the strongest football teams in Rio de Janeiro, winning the championships of 1907, 1910, 1912 and more.

With the same name, the same location, the same colours and most importantly the same supporters, it seemed inevitable that the clubs would merge. They did so on 8 December 1942, after a basketball match between both clubs, when the Botafogo Football Club player Armando Albano died suddenly, that the idea of a merger began. On this tragic occasion, the president of the Club de Regatas Botafogo, Augusto Frederico Schmidt, spoke: &quot;At this time, I declare to Albano that his last match ended with the victory of his team. We won&#x27;t play the time left on the clock. We all want the young fighter to leave this great night as a winner. This is how we salute him.&quot; Eduardo Góis Trindade, the president of the Botafogo Football Club said: &quot;Between the matches of our clubs, only one can be the winner: Botafogo!.&quot; And then Schmidt declared the fusion: &quot;What else do we need for our clubs to become one?.&quot; The Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas finally came into being. The Football Club&#x27;s badge became black, and the monogram substituted by the Clube de Regatas&#x27; lone star.

===On the field===

The team won the Campeonato Carioca in 1907, 1910 and 1912. In 1909 the team beat Mangueira 24–0, which remains the highest score in Brazilian football.
They won further state titles in 1930, 1932, 1933, 1934 and 1935.

In the 1940s, after the creation of the Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas, the team&#x27;s best player was Heleno de Freitas. However, Heleno did not win a championship for Botafogo. He scored 204 goals in 233 matches, but went to the Boca Juniors in 1948, the year Botafogo won its 9th state championship.

They won the Campeonato Carioca in 1957, 1961 and 1962, and in 1968 they won Serie A, becoming the first &quot;carioca&quot; club to win the Brazilian league.

1989 ended a period of 21 years without a title when the club won the state championship, retaining the trophy in 1990.

In the 1990s, Botafogo won Copa Conmebol (the precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana). And in 1995 they won the Brazilian League for the second time in club&#x27;s history, after drawing 1–1 the second leg of the Final against Santos FC at São Paulo.

Botafogo would be relegated to the Second Division after ranking last in the Brazilian League of 2002. In 2003, Botafogo ranked second in Brazil&#x27;s Second division (after Palmeiras) and returned to the First Division.

In 2006, the club won the Rio de Janeiro State Championship for the 18th time, and again in 2010 and 2013 with the iconic players Loco Abreu and Clarence Seedorf, respectively.

In the 2020 edition of the Série A, Botafogo performed poorly and ended the championship in the last position, causing the club&#x27;s relegation to the Série B for their third time in history.

Nowadays, Botafogo is the only club to have won titles in three different centuries, including the state championship for rowing in 1899.

===The SAF Era===
At the beginning of 2020, Botafogo underwent a series of internal audits to spin off its football division as a for-profit corporate entity, owned by the club, but which could be portioned and sold to investors. This was due to unprecedented legislation allowing for football clubs to be operated as corporations, and would be a solution to the severe financial crisis the club had faced for decades. Relegation to the Série B, however, delayed these plans.

2021 saw Botafogo&#x27;s debt reach one billion real. They placed 6th in the Rio de Janeiro State Championship, after a penalty decision lost to the also relegated Vasco da Gama. The club was off to a middling start to the Série B season, but bounced back after the hiring of manager Enderson Moreira, who was able to bring Botafogo back to the top tier of Brazilian football, as champions of the 2021 edition of Série B. It was Botafogo&#x27;s second Série B title.

Meanwhile, the incoming administration had begun internal restructuring, hiring executive Jorge Braga for the brand-new post of CEO and downsizing its workforce considerably. Botafogo entered into a partnership with the investment firm XP Inc. to seek out potential buyers for its football division, which was in the process of becoming its own corporate entity. Congress had recently passed the Sociedade Anônima de Futebol (SAF) law, allowing foreigners to purchase shares in Brazilian football clubs for the first time in history.

Having averted complete financial disaster by returning to Série A, the country&#x27;s top competitive tier, Botafogo finalized its transition into the SAF legal structure. The social club remained as an entity, owning 100% of Botafogo SAF&#x27;s shares. In January 2022, it came to light that American investor John Textor, owner of a majority stake in Premier League club Crystal Palace F.C., was in talks to purchase a majority share of Botafogo. In February 2022, the club announced the acquisition of 90% of the shares of Botafogo&#x27;s football division by Textor&#x27;s holding company Eagle Holdings and the start of a new era for the club.

Textor&#x27;s first major move in charge of the club was the dismissal of Enderson Moreira in favor of Portuguese manager Luís Castro. Castro signed with Botafogo in March 2022, and the team had to hurry to build their squad for the 2022 Campeonato Brasileiro. Botafogo finished that year&#x27;s league edition in 11th place, guaranteeing a spot in the 2023 Copa Sudamericana.

At the 2023 Campeonato Brasileiro, Botafogo, then thought of as a team that at most would fight for a spot in the top 6, shocked everyone by coming in first place after only 3 rounds, then leading the league by 13 points after 19 matches and on course to have the greatest first half of a season in Brazilian football history. In June 2023, coach Luís Castro accepted an offer from Al Nassr of the Saudi Pro League, paving the way for the arrival of Portuguese manager Bruno Lage. However, due to poor results and controversies, Lage was dismissed after about 3 months. For the remainder of the 2023 season, with the coaching position vacant, Botafogo&#x27;s SAF leadership decided to promote two fan favorites to key positions in the team&#x27;s management: a former coach of Botafogo&#x27;s U-23 team, Lúcio Flávio, was appointed interim coach, with former Argentine defender Joel Carli as his assistant. 

Constant change of managers caused Botafogo to have the biggest title collapse in football history, as the team won only 2 of their last 17 fixtures, not only losing the title to Palmeiras but dropping to 5th in the table and losing the automatic qualification spot for the Copa Libertadores. A round of 16 exit in the Copa do Brasil, a quarterfinal exit in the Copa Sudamericana, and a disappointing Campeonato Carioca made the year one of the most painful seasons in the club&#x27;s history.
The total debt owned by the club has been reduced and now sits at around 730 million reais.

==Stadium==

The team&#x27;s home ground is the Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos, named in honor of Nilton Santos, a former club player and two time world champion with the Brazil National Football Team, regarded as one of the greatest left-backs of all time. The stadium is commonly called Engenhão by fans, in reference to the neighbourhood of Engenho de Dentro, where it is located. The stadium was built for the 2007 Pan American Games and it also hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Other stadiums used by the club during its history are:
* Maracanã Stadium, 1950-2007
* Voluntários da Pátria Street Field, the club&#x27;s first pitch at their neighborhood of origin.
* Estádio General Severiano, the club&#x27;s first own stadium.(1913-1974)
* Marechal Hermes Stadium, for less important matches during 1978–1986.
* Estádio Caio Martins, at the neighboring city of Niterói. (1990-2004)
* Estádio Luso Brasileiro, during the 2005 and 2016 seasons.

==Rivals==

Its biggest rivals are the other most important Rio clubs: Fluminense, Flamengo, and Vasco da Gama.

The derby with Fluminense is known as the &quot;Clássico Vovô&quot; (Grandfather Derby) for it being the oldest derby in the whole of Brazilian football. The teams faced each other for the first time in 1905.

The matches with Vasco are known as the &quot;Clássico da Amizade&quot; (Friendship Derby) because the supporters of both clubs have been friends historically. It has been one of the less violent derbies in the city.

The derby against Flamengo, &quot;The Rivalry Derby&quot;, is the biggest one for Botafogo. The clubs&#x27; rivalry extends beyond the pitch, to the fans and the clubs&#x27; boardrooms. Players who participate in these matches usually become club idols. Some examples include Garrincha, Manga, Jairzinho, Túlio Maravilha, and more recently Loco Abreu and Jefferson. Flamengo&#x27;s biggest star Zico once said that in his childhood, Botafogo was the club he hated more than any other because of the &quot;Glorioso&quot;&#x27;s dominance in the derby.

From outside the city, the club also has a historic rivalry with Santos FC since the 1960s.

==Symbols==

===Lone Star===
The Lone Star (&quot;Estrela Solitária&quot;) is currently present in Botafogo&#x27;s flag and crest. This star was the principal symbol of Club de Regatas Botafogo. After the two Botafogos merged, the Lone Star became one of the most important symbols of Botafogo&#x27;s football team. It was originally meant to represent the planet Venus, also known as the Morning Star, which was often seen at sunrise by the rowing squad as they practiced very early in the morning.

===Flag===

&quot;Flag of Botafogo Football Club since its founding, in 1904. When merged with Club de Regatas Botafogo, in 1943, the flag of the football club was adopted in new Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas.&quot;]]&lt;br&gt;The old flag of Club de Regatas Botafogo was white with a small black square which contained the Lone Star. The Football Club had a flag with nine black and white stripes with the club&#x27;s crest localized in the center. Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas then based its flag on that of the two old clubs. The flag has five black and four white stripes, with a black square at the upper left side with the Lone Star.

===Uniform===

Their primary uniform consists of a black jersey with vertical white stripes, black shorts and grey socks. Their secondary uniform is all white. An all black uniform may also be used. The socks, although traditionally grey, may also be black or even white on rare occasions.

==Mascots==

The dog &quot;Biriba&quot; is one the most traditional mascots of Botafogo, in 1948 this real stray dog, known for invading the field, was the mascot that led them to the Campeonato Carioca title. 
Another Botafogo&#x27;s mascot is &quot;Manequinho&quot;, an urinating boy originating from a replica of Brussels&#x27; &quot;Manneken Pis&quot; statue that stands near Botafogo&#x27;s headquarters, which on occasion had a Botafogo jersey put onto by supporters of the team. The first mascot was Donald Duck, who cartoonist Lorenzo Mollas drew in the early 1940s wearing Botafogo&#x27;s jersey, but it was never officially adopted due to rights issues.

==Honours==
The club has some of Brazilian football&#x27;s top records, including most unbeaten matches: 52 games between 1977 and 1978, most unbeaten games in the Brazilian Championship: 42, also between 1977 and 1978, most player participations in total matches of the Brazil national team (considering official and unofficial games): 1,094 participations, and the most players assigned to the Brazil national team for the World Cup.

<text>Clube de Regatas do Flamengo (; ), more commonly referred to as simply Flamengo, is a Brazilian multi sports club based in Rio de Janeiro, in the neighborhood of Gávea. It was founded and named after the Flamengo neighborhood and is best known for their professional football team. They are one of two clubs to have never been relegated from the top division, along with São Paulo and is the most popular football club in Brazil with more than 46.9 million fans, equivalent to 21.9% of the population that supports a team in Brazil.

The club was first established in 1895 specifically as a rowing club in the Flamengo neighborhood and did not play their first official football match until 1912. Flamengo&#x27;s traditional uniform features red and black striped shirts with white shorts, and red and black striped socks. Flamengo has typically played their home matches in the Maracanã (which is also the Brazilian national team stadium) since its completion in 1950, with some exceptions in recent years. Since 1969, the vulture (Portuguese: &quot;urubu&quot;) has been the mascot of Flamengo.

Clube de Regatas do Flamengo is the most successful Brazilian team of the 21 century and one of Brazil&#x27;s most successful sports clubs in the 20th century during the era of state leagues in Brazil when they won several Campeonato Carioca (Rio de Janeiro state league) titles prior to the establishment of the first Brazilian national football championship in 1959. Since then, they have remained successful in Brazilian football, having won 7 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, 5 Copa do Brasil, 3 Supercopa do Brasil and a record 38 Campeonato Carioca. In South American and worldwide competitions, the club&#x27;s highest achievements are their conquests of the 1981, 2019 and 2022 Copa Libertadores, and 1981 Intercontinental Cup against Liverpool, led by the club&#x27;s most iconic player, Zico.

The name &quot;Flamengo&quot;, first referring to the Flamengo neighborhood and later to the club&#x27;s name, is a reference to the Dutch navigator Olivier Van Noort, who tried to invade the city of Rio de Janeiro in the 16th century from Flamengo Beach. &quot;Flamengo&quot; is a direct Portuguese translation from the word &quot;Flemish&quot;.

Flamengo&#x27;s fiercest and longest-standing rivalries are with the other &quot;Big Four&quot; clubs of Rio de Janeiro: Fluminense, Botafogo and Vasco da Gama; as well as interstate rivalries with Atlético Mineiro and Palmeiras.

It&#x27;s Brazil&#x27;s richest and most valuable football club with an annual revenue of R$1.2 billion (€ 218 million) and a valuation of over R$3.8 billion (€691 million). Flamengo became the non-European football club with the most followers on social media with 49 million followers across all platforms as of 18 June 2023.

Flamengo&#x27;s youth academy is one of the most prolific in Brazil and in the world, and have developed a number of Brazilian internationals such as Zico, Zizinho, Vinícius Júnior, Lucas Paquetá, Júlio César, Adriano, Mário Zagallo, Júnior and Leonardo.

Flamengo&#x27;s training center, officially known as &quot;Ninho do Urubu&quot; (which translates to &quot;Vulture&#x27;s Nest&quot; in English), is located in Vargem Grande, Rio de Janeiro. It serves as the primary training facility for the Flamengo football club, housing their professional teams as well as youth academy.

Flamengo have also been well represented in the Brazil national football team; At the 1938 FIFA World Cup, forward Leônidas, a Flamengo player at the time, was the Golden Boot winner with 7 goals and won the Golden Ball, thus becoming the first Brazilian player ever to win those two awards. Twelve years later at the 1950 World Cup, Zizinho, a midfielder for Flamengo, also won the Golden Ball after he was voted best player; 4 out of the 10 top scorers for the Brazil National Team have all been Flamengo players at one point in their careers, seven players have won the World Cup whilst playing for Flamengo, and Flamengo player Màrio Zagallo scored Brazil&#x27;s third goal in the 1958 World Cup final.

==History==

=== Establishment of the club (1895–1912) ===
Flamengo was founded on 17 November 1895, by a group of rowers gathered at club member Nestor de Barros&#x27;s manor on Flamengo Beach in Rio de Janeiro. In the late 19th century, rowing was the elite, upper middle class sport in the region and the group hoped to impress the young women of the city&#x27;s high society by establishing a rowing club. Previously, they could only afford a used boat named &quot;Pherusa&quot;, which had to be completely rebuilt before it could be used in competition. The team debuted on October 6, 1895, when they sailed off the Caju Point toward Flamengo Beach. However, strong winds turned over the boat and the rowers nearly drowned. They were rescued by a fishing boat named &quot;Leal&quot; (Loyal). Later as the &quot;Pherusa&quot; was undergoing repairs, it was stolen and never found again. The group saved money to buy a new boat, the &quot;Etoile&quot;, renamed &quot;Scyra&quot;.

On the night of 17 November, the group gathered at Nestor de Barros&#x27;s manor on Flamengo beach and founded the &quot;Grupo de Regatas do Flamengo&quot; (English: &quot;Flamengo Rowing Group&quot;) and elected its first board and president (Domingos Marques de Azevedo). The name was changed a few weeks later to its current title of &quot;Clube de Regatas do Flamengo&quot; (&quot;Flamengo Rowing Club&quot;). The founders decided that the anniversary of the club&#x27;s foundation should be commemorated on 15 November to coincide with Republic Proclamation Day, a national holiday.

Flamengo&#x27;s football team was only established after a group of ten dissatisfied players from Fluminense broke away from that club following a board dispute. The players decided to join Flamengo because Alberto Borgerth, the team&#x27;s captain, was also a rower for Flamengo. Also, establishing a land sports department at Flamengo was preferable to joining football rivals Botafogo or the all-English club Paissandu. The new members were admitted on 8 November 1911. A motion against the club taking part in football tournaments was put to a vote but was defeated, and as a result the members officially established the club&#x27;s new football department on 24 December 1911.

=== Football in the amateur era (1912–1933) ===

The new team trained on and gradually gained the support of the locals, who closely watched their practice matches. The first official match was played on 3 May 1912, and marked, to this day, the largest margin of victory in the club&#x27;s history, as they defeated Mangueira 16–2. Flamengo&#x27;s first ever match against Fluminense, the start of the Fla-Flu rivalry, was played on 7 July of that year and was won by Fluminense by a score of 3–2. That same year, Flamengo finished as runners-up of the Campeonato Carioca, the Rio de Janeiro State Championship. The team&#x27;s first uniform was nicknamed the &quot;&quot;papagaio vintém&quot;, due to its similarity to a particular type of kite.
In 1914 the club won the Campeonato Carioca for the first time, dressed in a red, black, and white-striped shirt nicknamed the &quot;cobra coral&quot;&quot; (coral snake) was worn until 1916. Flamengo won the Campeonato Carioca again the following year, in 1915, and secured their first back-to-back championship; something they also did with their titles in 1920 and 1921.

In 1925, the team won the Campeonato Carioca and five other tournaments, a record at the time. In 1927 the prominent Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil, in partnership with a mineral water company, held a mail-in contest to find &quot;the most beloved club in Brazil.&quot; Though Flamengo enjoyed their largest increase in fan support after the club professionalized in the 1930s, they still defeated popular rivals Vasco da Gama in the vote. This was the first of many times that Flamengo would be polled as the nation&#x27;s most popular club, originating the nickname &quot;O mais querido do Brasil&quot; (&quot;the most beloved of Brazil&quot;). In 1933 the team went on its first tour outside Brazil (to Montevideo and Buenos Aires) and on 14 May of the same year played its final match as an amateur team, defeating River Futebol Clube by a score of 16–2. After this, the club&#x27;s football department became professional.

===Early professional era (1934–1955)===
Local advertiser José Bastos Padilha was elected club president in 1934 and served until 1937. Under his tenure, the club massively improved its popularity in both Rio de Janeiro and the entirety of Brazil. For publicity, he organized a contest for students in schools to create phrases describing Flamengo, from which the phrase &quot;uma vez Flamengo, Flamengo até morrer&quot; (&quot;Once you are Flamengo, you are Flamengo &#x27;til you die&quot;) was developed and would later be adopted as part of the club&#x27;s anthem. In 1936 Padilha signed excellent players such as Domingos da Guia and Leônidas da Silva (who would go on to be the leading goalscorer in the 1938 FIFA World Cup as a Flamengo player). These beloved players endeared Flamengo to the public and it is believed that by this time Flamengo was the most popular club in the country. In 1937 Flamengo hired Hungarian coach Izidor &quot;Dori&quot; Kürschner, who introduced the WM system to Brazil and other innovations from Europe such as training without the use of the ball and playing a more defensive, controlled style. Padilha facilitated the construction of Flamengo&#x27;s new stadium and current training center, the Estádio da Gávea. The stadium was inaugurated on 4 September 1938, when Vasco da Gama defeated Flamengo 2–0 and Kürschner was promptly fired.

In 1938, the five-year split in Rio de Janeiro football over the dispute between professionalism and amateurism was resolved with the merger of the two competing leagues (Flamengo had been a member of the professional LCF - &quot;Liga Carioca de Football&quot;). In 1939, after twelve years without winning any titles, Flamengo conquered the state championship with a team that would become the basis of the three-time state champions in the 1940s.

In 1941, the group played its first international competition, the Hexagonal Tournament of Argentina. In 1942, the first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra, was founded in support of Flamengo. Flamengo&#x27;s popularity grew incidentally during World War II when Brazil&#x27;s allies, the United States, installed two high-powered antennas in Natal and Belém in the north of Brazil to intercept enemy radio signals. They also allowed residents in the North and Northeast regions to receive the radio broadcasts of football matches. As Rio de Janeiro was the national capital at the time and Flamengo was highly successful in the war years with Zizinho and Domingos da Guia, nationwide support increased. In 1944, Flamengo completed their first &quot;tricampeonato Carioca&quot;: three consecutive Rio de Janeiro state titles (winning the 1942, 1943, and 1944 competitions). The key player of this squad was Zizinho, a player developed at Flamengo and considered the first ever &quot;idol&quot; of the club. Zizinho was transferred to Bangu just before the start of the 1950 World Cup in Brazil, where he scored twice and the &quot;Seleção&quot; finished runners-up. From 1953 to 1955, Flamengo once again won the Rio de Janeiro State League three consecutive times.

=== Zico and the world champions (1974–1983) ===
Flamengo won their 18th Campeonato Carioca state championship in 1978. The following five years would come to represent the club&#x27;s most glorious era. Brazilian stars like Júnior, Carpegiani, Adílio, Cláudio Adão and Tita were led by Zico to become state champions three times in a row - the club&#x27;s third tri-championship. This run of sustained excellent play pushed Flamengo towards its first Brazilian Championship in 1980. As national champions, the club qualified to play in the South American continental tournament, the 1981 Copa Libertadores, for the first time.

The 1981 season is a benchmark year in Flamengo&#x27;s history. They advanced through the semi-final group stage of the Copa Libertadores with four victories in four matches. In the final they encountered Chilean club Cobreloa, also a debutante club in the tournament. In the first final at the Maracanã, Flamengo prevailed (2–1) with two goals from Zico. At the National Stadium in Santiago the following week, the Brazilian team received a violent reception on the field and fell 1–0 from a free kick. Equal on goals, a third match was played at the neutral venue of the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo. Zico scored twice in the first half, sealing the game and the championship. Flamengo were crowned champions of South America on November 23 and qualified for the Intercontinental Cup, a single match to be played in Tokyo&#x27;s Olympic Stadium against European Champions&#x27; Cup winner Liverpool F.C..

On 13 December 1981, Zico, Tita, and Nunes took the field for the most important match in the club&#x27;s history. Two goals by Nunes and one by Adílio (all in the first half) along with a brilliant midfield performance by Zico earned Flamengo the title of first Brazilian World Champions since Pelé&#x27;s Santos, shutting out Liverpool 3–0.

The following two years were also marked with success. One more Rio de Janeiro State Championship in 1981 and two back-to-back Brazilian Championships – 1982 and 1983 – closed Flamengo&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age.&quot;

===National success and the return of Zico (1984–1994)===

After spending two years in Italy playing for Udinese, Zico returned to Flamengo in 1986 and won his last state championship. Only one month after returning, he suffered a severe knee injury after a violent tackle from Bangu defender Marcio Nunes, which interrupted his career for several months and affected his form in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

In 1987, Zico was a major contributor to Flamengo&#x27;s victory in the first edition of the Copa União. That year, the CBF was experiencing serious financial and institutional crises and was unable to secure sponsorship to organize the national championship as in years prior. As a result, the thirteen biggest clubs in Brazil (which included Flamengo) reacted and created a new entity named the Club of 13 to organize a championship of their own. The CBF originally supported the decision by the Club of 13, but were pressured by other clubs to create a larger national tournament. As a result, CBF placed three additional clubs into the Copa União, regarded the Copa União as the &quot;Green Module,&quot; and organized a second &quot;Yellow Module&quot; of 16 other teams. CBF then decided that for the 1987 Brazilian Championship, the winners and runners-up of both modules would face each other in a knockout-style cup to determine the national champion and qualification for the Copa Libertadores, although this decision was made after the beginning of the championship, without Club of 13 agreement. With strong performances from Zico, Zé Carlos, Renato Gaúcho and Bebeto, Flamengo conquered the Copa União with major victories over Internacional and Atlético Mineiro. However, there was a dispute over whether Flamengo and Internacional of the Green Module would dispute the quadrangular against Sport Recife and Guarani of the Yellow Module. The Club of 13 clubs had agreed to not participate in the final set up by the CBF, since it was decided while the matches were already being played, but Eurico Miranda, a representative of Vasco, Flamengo&#x27;s archi-rival and member of the Club of 13, had already signed an agreement with CBF regarding the final, without the board consent. Flamengo still did not participate in the final under the understanding that it would only determine the entrants of the Copa Libertadores and not the Brazilian national champion. CBF officially recognized Sport as the sole champion in 1987 and they qualified to the Copa Libertadores. In 2011, CBF retroactively declared Flamengo champion of 1987. However, Sport later appealed the decision to a Common Justice Tribunal, which is prohibited by FIFA, and CBF ultimately declared Sport as the sole champion of that year, pending appeals from Flamengo, all of which were unsuccessful, and a few years later Sport was officially declared as the champion of the 1987 season.

Throughout his career at Flamengo, Zico scored 508 goals and was the top scorer in club history before retiring in 1990.

Even without its biggest star, the early years of the post-Zico era were successful for Flamengo. They achieved national victory in the second edition of the Copa do Brasil in 1990, defeating Goiás in the finals. In 1992, Flamengo won their fifth Campeonato Brasileiro, defeating Botafogo across two legs in the final (3–0, 2–2). The team&#x27;s key player was again Júnior at 38 years old.

===Mediocre campaigns and relegation escapes (1995–2005)===
After winning the Brazilian League title in 1992, the club entered a major financial crisis and domestic and international achievements became less frequent, although the team still won trophies ranked less in importance. In 1993, Flamengo lost the Supercopa Libertadores finals to Sao Paulo. In 1995, the year of Flamengo&#x27;s centenary, radio sports broadcaster Kléber Leite became chairman of the club and signed striker Romário, the current FIFA World Player of the Year, from Barcelona. He joined Sávio and later Edmundo to become, as the supporters called, &quot;the attack of dreams&quot;. Even with Romário and other stars, Flamengo&#x27;s centennial year did not yield major trophies, and the club struggled in the league, finishing 21st of 24. Flamengo only won the Taça Guanabara, the first phase of the state league, and finished runners-up of 1995 Supercopa Libertadores. However, in 1996, Flamengo went undefeated in the Campeonato Carioca. Sávio was the top scorer and best player in Flamengo&#x27;s victorious 1996 Copa de Oro campaign. The Copa de Oro was Flamengo&#x27;s first international success since 1981, their third overall international title.

In 1997 Flamengo finished trophyless for one of the few times in its history, but overall had a good season, finishing fifth in the Serie A, finishing runner-up to Grêmio in the Copa do Brasil on away goals, and finishing runner-up in the Torneo Rio-Sao Paulo. 1998 was another trophyless season, but far worse than 1997; &quot;Mengão&quot; finished 11th in the Serie A, were knocked out of the Copa do Brasil with a 5-0 loss to Vitoria, and failed to advance out of the group stages of the Copa Mercosur, although top scorer Romario continued to show individual brilliance with 35 goals from 40 appearances.

In 1999, Edmundo dos Santos Silva was elected club president, and brought with him a massive contract with sports marketing company ISL. Despite a mediocre campaign in that year&#x27;s Campeonato Brasileiro, finishing 12th, the club lifted the 1999 Copa Mercosur at Estádio Palestra Itália after beating Palmeiras 7-6 on aggregate in an exciting two legged final, and were successful at the regional level, winning the Campeonato Carioca over rivals Vasco, who had won the 1998 Copa Libertadores. 

2000 was also a mediocre year for the club, being knocked out of the Copa Mercosur by River Plate in the quarter-finals, and exiting the Copa do Brasil with a heavy 8-2 aggregate loss to Santos. However the club were successful at the regional level again, beating Vasco 5-1 on aggregate for a back-to-back championship.

In 2001 league play, Flamengo avoided relegation to the Série B by beating Palmeiras 2-0 on the final matchday. Despite near relegation, the club had a decent season overall; they won the 2001 Copa dos Campeões inter-state title, finished runner up in the 2001 Copa Mercosur to San Lorenzo on penalties, and beat Vasco again in the state league with a late free-kick goal by Dejan Petković. With the state title, the club became &quot;tricampeão&quot; (three-time champion) for the fourth time in its history (1999-2000-2001) . 

In 2002, ISL went bankrupt, for reasons unrelated to their contract with Flamengo, and the club was left without its wealthy partner. In the same year, Edmundo Santos Silva was removed from his role as president in a controversial manner amidst accusation of impropriety. Lacking the funds to make key signings, Flamengo failed to field competitive teams and narrowly avoided relegation in the 2002, 2004, and 2005 campaigns, with the 2005 season being one of the worst in Flamengo&#x27;s history; the club only escaped relegation after the arrival of coach Joel Santana, who directed the team to six wins and three draws in nine matches played under his command. Twice in this low period, the team reached back-to-back Copa do Brasil finals, in 2003 and 2004, ultimately falling to Cruzeiro and Santo André respectively. This Flamengo has also evaded massive taxes in the .

===End of title drought (2006–2018)===
In 2006, Flamengo reached the Copa do Brasil final for a fifth time, finally managing to conquer the title after losing three previous finals, this time beating rivals Vasco da Gama. From 2007 to 2009 Flamengo completed their fifth &quot;tricampeonato&quot; in the Campeonato Carioca, and became sole owners of the record for most Carioca titles with 31 (Fluminense had 30 at the time).

On 9 March 2007, Flamengo received a commemorative date on the Rio de Janeiro official calendar. Governor Sérgio Cabral Filho declared 17 November (the day the club was founded) &quot;Flamengo Day&quot;.

In the 2007 Copa Libertadores, after a near-perfect group stage where the club was undefeated, expectations were high for the team. However, the club was eliminated by Uruguayan minnows Defensor Sporting in the first knockout round. In the Campeonato Brasileiro, Flamengo spent most of the season in mid table hoping for at least a top ten finish but in the last five matchdays climbed to second place before being defeated by Náutico 1–0 in the final round and ultimately ending the season third, which was good enough for a spot in the following year&#x27;s Copa Libertadores. 

In the 2008 Copa Libertadores, Flamengo began their campaign by topping their group. After defeating Club América 4-2 at Estadio Azteca, in what was Flamengo&#x27;s first tournament tie against a Mexican club, Flamengo looked to be one of the strongest sides in the competition. However, Flamengo polemically lost the second leg at home 3-0 and were eliminated in the round of 16 again, in what was Joel Santana&#x27;s final match with the club. In the Brasileirao, Flamengo finished fifth, and in 2009 despite being in tenth place in midseason, Flamengo won the league title for the first time since 1992. With this victory Flamengo became five-time league champions, seventeen seasons after their last title. The 2009 championship team finished the season with 67 points, the lowest winning point total in Brazil since the current league format was established in 2003. Flamengo were champions despite spending only two rounds at the top of the league: the final two, and the title was won after a dramatic 2–1 comeback victory against Grêmio in the final round.
Flamengo experienced a poor run in Série A from 2010 to 2015, finishing better than tenth only once. Following the success of 2009, the club gambled on winning several titles and signed striker Vágner Love to form a pair with Adriano. The dream of repeating as state champions four times in a row was foiled by Botafogo in 2010. After narrowly qualifying out of the group stage in the Copa Libertadores, manager Andrade was still fired. In their first quarter-final appearance since 1993, after disposing of Corinthians, Flamengo were eliminated by Universidad de Chile on away goals. Shortly after, Vágner Love and Adriano left the team. A series of coaching changes during the troublesome domestic league saw Flamengo survive relegation, avoiding defeat in their final nine matches, and claim the final berth to the Copa Sudamericana under manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo.

The blockbuster signing of 2011 was 30-year-old superstar Ronaldinho from Milan. He was joined by Argentine Darío Bottinelli and Fluminense idol Thiago Neves. Flamengo won the Campeonato Carioca outright in an undefeated campaign, but captured no other trophies that season: eliminations in the Copa do Brasil by Ceará, a heavy 5–0 loss in the Sudamericana by Universidad de Chile, and a fourth-place finish in the league left fans feeling that a strong roster had been squandered. The season saw the retirement of Serbian club idol Dejan Petković as well. In 2012 Ronaldinho sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and canceled his contract with the club, Thiago Neves returned to Fluminense after a drawn-out negotiation with contract-holders Al-Hilal, and defender Alex Silva was loaned to Cruzeiro after threatening Flamengo with a lawsuit. Vágner Love and Ibson returned for a 2012 campaign that yielded no trophies and a group-stage exit from the Copa Libertadores.

At the end of 2012, Flamengo elected Eduardo Bandeira de Mello as club president for three years. The goal of his term was to improve the club&#x27;s finances, after an independent audit assessed Flamengo&#x27;s debt at R$750 million. After a typical series of managerial changes, Jayme de Almeida was appointed as interim manager during which he fought off relegation and won the 2013 Copa do Brasil final against Atlético Paranaense. It was Flamengo&#x27;s third Copa title, after 1990 and 2006.

Flamengo&#x27;s Copa do Brasil title-defense fell short to Atlético Mineiro in the semi-final. However, by 2014, Flamengo was the only club that successfully reduced their debt over the year (down to R$600 million) and recorded the highest annual profit. In 2015 after an inconsistent start to the Carioca and national league seasons, multiple managers were dismissed and Flamengo failed to qualify for the Libertadores. However, Flamengo had signed Paolo Guerrero and Ederson and were the most valuable club in Brazil with debt now reduced to R$495 million. As a result, president Bandeira was re-elected. The club signed fan-favorite Diego in the mid-season and mounted a strong campaign, but could not catch Palmeiras in 2016.

2017 was characterized as the year Flamengo played two major finals at the end of the season but failed to win either. After going undefeated in the 2017 Campeonato Carioca, they were eliminated in the Copa Libertadores group stage, failing to win a single match away from home but qualifying for the Copa Sudamericana in third place. In the Copa do Brasil, the club reached the final where they lost in a penalty shootout to Cruzeiro. Less than three months later, they reached an unprecedented Copa Sudamericana final. They lost away to Independiente and drew at home 1–1, losing the title. After the match, a group of Flamengo supporters rioted outside the hotel where Independiente were staying. CONMEBOL punished the club with two closed-door home matches in the following Copa Libertadores. In the league, the club finished sixth and qualified for the following year&#x27;s Libertadores.

Nine years after their last Campeonato Brasileiro victory, Flamengo made a title run but fell just short. In 2018 they spent the most rounds as league leader (thirteen) and broke their points record from 2016 (72), but finished runners-up behind Palmeiras. In the Libertadores they finished runner-up behind eventual champion River Plate and qualified to the round of 16, where they were eliminated by Cruzeiro. That season, the club recorded their two highest outgoing transfer fees in history: 18-year-old winger Vinícius Júnior moved to Real Madrid in July for €46 million, and 20-year-old midfielder Lucas Paquetá transferred to A.C. Milan for a reported €35 million at the end of the year. Both were products of Flamengo&#x27;s youth academy.

=== New glory (2019–present) ===
====2019 season====
On the morning of 8 February 2019 a fire erupted at Flamengo&#x27;s Ninho do Urubu training center, popular name for Centro de Treinamento George Helal (Vulture&#x27;s Nest training center) (Flamengo training ground fire). The fire resulted in the deaths of ten academy players between the ages of 14 and 17 training with the club. Three others were injured. The cause of the fire was a malfunctioning air-conditioning unit that caught fire in the room of one of the victims close to 5:00 am. President Rodolfo Landim described it as &quot;the worst tragedy the club has ever experienced in its 123 years.&quot; The governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro declared a three-day period of mourning following the tragedy. Since then, Flamengo fans sing in memory of those kids, usually referred to as the &quot;Garotos do Ninho&quot;. It happens every tenth minute of Flamengo home games, since 10 kids died in the tragedy.

The 2019 season marked the most successful one in the club&#x27;s footballing history. At the end of 2018, Rodolfo Landim was elected club president for a three-year term. Flamengo paid the most expensive incoming transfer fee for a player in Brazilian football history, signing Giorgian de Arrascaeta from Cruzeiro for R$63 million (€14.5 million). In January the club signed forward Bruno Henrique from Santos and secured the loan of striker Gabriel Barbosa from Inter Milan.

After advancing out of the Copa Libertadores group stage, manager Abel Braga resigned and Flamengo hired Portuguese manager Jorge Jesus. Europe-based players Rafinha, Filipe Luís, Pablo Marí and Gerson were added to play alongside Flamengo&#x27;s other record signings. After qualifying to their first Copa Libertadores semi-final since 1984, Flamengo defeated Grêmio 5–0 in their home leg at the Maracanã to advance their first Copa Libertadores final since 1981. For the first time in Copa Libertadores history, the final was played as a single match in a neutral venue. On 23 November 2019, at the Estadio Monumental in Lima, Peru against defending champions River Plate, Flamengo trailed 0–1 in the final minutes before Gabriel scored twice to secure the 2–1 victory.

Less than 24 hours later, Flamengo became champions of the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A for the first time since 2009 with four matches in hand after a loss by Palmeiras to Grêmio in the 34th round. Flamengo became only the second Brazilian club to win their state championship (2019 Campeonato Carioca), Campeonato Brasileiro, and Copa Libertadores in the same season, after Pelé&#x27;s 1962 Santos team. Flamengo&#x27;s 2019 campaign under Jorge Jesus&#x27; leadership broke a number of records in the Campeonato Brasileiro&#x27;s 20-team double round-robin era (2006–present): most points (90), most wins (28), most goals scored (86), best goal differential (+49), longest undefeated streak (24 matches), most points clear of runners-up (16) and most goals by a single player (25 from Gabriel Barbosa).

Flamengo participated in the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history in 2019 in Qatar. The club defeated Al Hilal SFC 3–1 in the semi-final, but lost 0–1 to Liverpool in the final.

====2020 season====

After winning the revived Supercopa do Brasil against Athletico Paranaense, then the Recopa Sudamericana against Copa Sudamericana champions Independiente del Valle, and the 2020 Campeonato Carioca, in July 2020 Jorge Jesus departed from Flamengo to return to Benfica, having won five titles in Brazil. Jesus&#x27;s successor was former Pep Guardiola assistant Domènec Torrent, but his tenure was brief and he was replaced with Rogério Ceni in November 2020. Ceni led Flamengo to a second consecutive Campeonato Brasileiro championship, finishing one point ahead of Internacional.

====2021 season====
In 2021 Ceni led Flamengo to a third consecutive Campeonato Carioca, but was released after four losses in Flamengo&#x27;s first ten Campeonato Brasileiro Série A matches. The club signed Renato Gaúcho as manager, who brought strong results in league play and took Flamengo back to the Copa Libertadores Final against Palmeiras, but lost 2–1 in extra time on 27 November 2021. He and the club parted ways after.

====2022 season====
In 2022, after a difficult start to the year under manager Paulo Sousa (runners-up in the Campeonato Carioca and Supercopa do Brasil), Dorival Júnior returned to Flamengo and brought another wave of glory. The team advanced to the finals of the Copa do Brasil against Corinthians. In the second leg in the Maracanã, tied 1–1 on aggregate, Flamengo were victorious in the penalty shootout with Rodinei scoring the winner. This was Flamengo&#x27;s fourth Copa do Brasil championship and first since 2013. Later that month on 29 October 2022, Flamengo faced Athletico Paranaense in Guayaquil, Ecuador for the final of the Copa Libertadores. Gabriel Barbosa scored the only goal of the match and Flamengo claimed their second Copa Libertadores in four years, and third overall.

==Team image==
===Crest===
Flamengo&#x27;s crest has changed slightly throughout the club&#x27;s history. Most of the changes has been changes to the interlocked letters monogram, with the latest redesign being unveiled in 2018.

The club uses three crests in different situations: the full crest is used as the club&#x27;s official logo, the rowing crest is used for all rowing related uniforms and equipment, and the white &quot;CRF&quot; monogram is typically the only component of the crest worn on the primary football uniform. It remarkably resembles the &quot;RFC&quot; monogram traditionally used by Scottish club Rangers F.C..

Beginning in 1980, Flamengo wore three white stars aligned vertically along the side of their monogram crest to indicate their three state league tri-championships (1942–43–44, 1953–54–55, and 1978–79–79 Special). When Nike became Flamengo&#x27;s kit provider in 2000, their first kit featured the full shield crest with three stars above it for the first time. After the fourth state league tri-championship (1999-2000-2001) and to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 1981 Copa Libertadores and Intercontinental Cup championships, a fourth white star and a gold star were introduced above the crest. Since 2005 the club uses only the gold star above the &quot;CRF&quot; monogram crest on their shirts.

===Uniforms===
At the 1895 meeting which established the Flamengo rowing club, the club&#x27;s official colors were decided as blue and gold to symbolized the sky of Rio de Janeiro and the riches of Brazil. The team adopted a uniform of thick blue and gold horizontal stripes. However Flamengo failed to win a single regatta in their first year and gained the nickname of &quot;bronze club.&quot; The team colors were perceived as bad luck, and the colored fabric was expensive to import from England. One year after the club&#x27;s establishment, the official colors were replaced with the current red and black.

In 1912, at the request of the Flamengo rowing team (who opposed the use of their same uniform by the newly established football team), the football players dressed in shirts divided into red and black quarters which became known as the &quot;papagaio de vintém&quot; uniform, named after a particular style of kite. However the shirt became synonymous with bad luck and was replaced in 1913 by a shirt with red and black horizontal stripes and thinner white bands. This uniform was nicknamed the &quot;cobra coral&quot; due to its similarity to the pattern of a coral snake. This was the uniform worn when Flamengo won their first Campeonato Carioca title in 1914. The white bands were removed from the shirt in 1916 as the pattern was very similar to the flag of Germany at the time, who Brazil was allied against in World War I. The rowing team permitted the football team to use their same uniform, and Flamengo&#x27;s traditional football uniform of a red and black striped shirt, white shorts and red-black socks was born.

In 1938, Flamengo manager Dori Kruschner suggested the creation of a secondary white uniform to &quot;improve the visibility in night matches.&quot; The new uniform was approved by the club, and Flamengo became a pioneer of secondary uniforms in Brazil. The white shirt had two red and black stripes across the chest until 1979 when it was changed to a plain white chest with stripes on the sleeves. This was the shirt worn by the team that won the 1981 Intercontinental Cup.

Beginning in the 1990s the club began to experiment with their second and third alternative uniforms, sometimes wearing all black or all red shirts. In 1995 for the club&#x27;s centenary, a &quot;papagaio de vintém&quot; shirt was worn in friendlies. In 2010 uniform supplier Olympikus introduced a blue and gold alternative uniform which paid homage to Flamengo&#x27;s original colors and regatta uniform, however it was not well received by fans who likened it to the uniform worn by the fictional satirical team &quot;Tabajara&quot; on the popular comedy program Casseta &amp; Planeta Urgente. In the first half of the 2009 season, the team wore a uniform without sponsorship for the first time in 25 years. Flamengo have continued to traditionally wear red and black striped shirts with white shorts as their primary uniform.

The following is a list of Flamengo&#x27;s sponsors and uniform suppliers.

===Scarlet-Black Nation===
Since the early 1990s, surveys have shown that Flamengo is consistently the most supported club in Brazil with an estimated more than 40 million fans. In a 2019 survey, 20 percent of adult football fans in Brazil consider themselves supporters of Flamengo, with high levels of support in all states of the country, including the North and Northeast regions, in addition to Rio de Janeiro. Flamengo supporters are known as &quot;Nação Rubro-Negra&quot; (en: &quot;Scarlet-Black Nation&quot;).

The first organized supporters group in all of Brazil, Charanga Rubro-Negra (&quot;Scarlet-Black Charanga Band&quot;), was founded in support of Flamengo in 1942. Since then, a large number of additional organized supporters groups have formed around Flamengo, notably Torcida Jovem-Fla (&quot;Young-Fla&quot;), Urubuzada (&quot;Vultures&quot;), Flamanguaça (&quot;FlaBooze&quot;), and Raça Rubro-Negra (&quot;Scarlet-Black Race&quot;).

In 2007 Flamengo supporters were declared as part of the cultural heritage of the city of Rio de Janeiro, along with bossa nova and Bola Preta, the oldest Carnival block in Rio.

In the 1983 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A final, Flamengo played against Santos in the Maracanã in front of an official crowd of 155,523 with some estimates of over 160,000 people in attendance.

The largest attendance for a football match in the world&#x27;s history was the derby between Flamengo and Fluminense in 1963, with 194,603 spectators. Flamengo matches in the Maracanã have broken the 150,000 attendance mark thirteen times.

In July 2020, their YouTube channel FLATV passed Liverpool F.C. as the club with the third-most subscriptions for a football channel only behind Barcelona and Real Madrid. Flamengo&#x27;s channel reached over 5 million subscriptions.

===Mascot===
Flamengo&#x27;s first mascot was Popeye the Sailor Man, a comic book and cartoon character from the 1940s. The idea for the mascot came from Argentine cartoonist Lorenzo Molas, who saw in Popeye the strength and persistence of Flamengo, in addition to its obvious connection with the sea. However, such a mascot was never very popular among the club&#x27;s supporters.

In the 1960s, rival fans began to call Flamengo fans &quot;urubus&quot; (English: &quot;vultures&quot;), a racist allusion to the large mass of Afro-descendant and poor suporters. Such an offensive nickname was never well received by Flamengo fans, until May 31, 1969. It was on a Sunday, when a Scarlet-Black fan decided to take a vulture to a game between Flamengo and Botafogo at Maracanã. At the time, the two clubs were playing the classic with the greatest post-Garrincha rivalry. And Flamengo hadn&#x27;t beaten the rival for four years. In the stands, Botafogo fans shouted, as always, that Flamengo was a &quot;urubu&quot; team.

The vulture was released in the stands with a Flamengo&#x27;s flag tied to its feet and, when it landed on the field, just before the game started, the crowd cheered and shouted: &quot;É urubu, é urubu.&quot; (English: &quot;it&#x27;s a vulture, it&#x27;s a vulture&quot;). Flamengo won the game 2-1 and, from there, the new mascot was consecrated, taking Popeye&#x27;s place. The cartoonist Henfil, tried to humanize him in his sports cartoons in newspapers and magazines, and the &quot;Urubu&quot; became a popular mascot.

In 2000, Flamengo&#x27;s mascot received an official design and a name: &quot;Samuca&quot;. However, this name did not become popular among the supporters, who continue to call him simply &quot;Urubu&quot;.

On 25 May 2008, debuted at Maracanã in a match between Flamengo and Internacional, valid for the 2008 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. Since then, they have been present in several Flamengo games and events.

===Anthem===
Flamengo has two anthems: the official one, called &quot;Hymno Rubro-Negro&quot; (English: &quot;Scarlet-Black Anthem&quot;), which was created in 1920 with lyrics and music by Paulo Magalhães (former goalkeeper of the club), recorded in 1932 by singer Castro Barbosa and registered in 1937 at the Instituto Nacional de Música, with the refrain &quot;Flamengo! Flamengo! Tua glória é lutar, Flamengo! Flamengo! Campeão de terra e mar&quot; (in English: &quot;Flamengo! Flamengo! Your glory is to fight, Flamengo! Flamengo! Champion of land and sea&quot;); and the popular one, with lyrics and music by Lamartine Babo, recorded for the first time by Gilberto Alves in 1945. The latter is the best known and the one that sings the glories of the club, whose refrain is &quot;Uma vez Flamengo, sempre Flamengo&quot; (English: &quot;Once you are Flamengo, always Flamengo&quot;).

==Stadiums==
===Rua Paysandu===
Flamengo&#x27;s first official home ground was the Estádio da Rua Paysandu (&quot;Paysandu Street Stadium&quot;). The ground formerly belonged to Paissandu Atlético Clube before they ceased playing football in 1914. The owners of the ground rented the field to Flamengo where they played their home matches from 1915 to 1932. Between 1912 and 1915 (and later between 1932 and 1938), the club played all their matches on the grounds of Botafogo or Fluminense. The first Flamengo match at Rua Paysandu was played on October 31, 1915, in the Campeonato Carioca against Bangu. Crowds of 15,000 watched Flamengo face Fluminese at the park in 1918 and 1919.

===Estádio da Gávea===


Flamengo&#x27;s home stadium is nominally the Estádio da Gávea (officially named the Estádio José Bastos Padilha at Flamengo&#x27;s Gávea Headquarters), which was inaugurated on 4 September 1938, and has a capacity of 4,000 people. The stadium is named after José Bastos Padilha, Flamengo&#x27;s president at the time of the stadium&#x27;s construction, from 1933 to 1937. Even though Flamengo no longer play their matches at Gávea, the site serves as the club&#x27;s administrative headquarters. Since the 1990s, the stadium has been used almost exclusively for the club&#x27;s youth and women&#x27;s teams&#x27; matches, and as the training ground for the senior team. Most matches are played at the significantly larger Maracanã Stadium, considered by supporters as the real Flamengo home ground. Gávea Stadium is not actually located in the neighborhood of Gávea but rather in Leblon.

During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Dutch National Team used the Estádio da Gávea and all of its facilities as their training ground in preparation for the competition.

===Maracanã===

Since its construction for the 1950 World Cup, the Maracanã has primarily served as the home ground for the four biggest Rio de Janeiro clubs. The stadium was officially completed in 1965, 17 years after construction began. In 1963, more than 194,000 people attended a match between Flamengo and Fluminense at the Maracanã. The capacity of the stadium allowed Flamengo to have the largest support of any clubs in Brazil for much of the 20th century. In 1989 Zico scored his final goal in the historic stadium, setting the current unbroken record for goals in the Maracanã at 333. An upper stand in the stadium collapsed on July 19, 1992, in the second match of the finals of 1992 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A between Botafogo and Flamengo, leading to the death of three spectators and injuring 50 others. Following the disaster, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was greatly reduced as it was converted to an all-seater stadium in the late 1990s. Following its 50th anniversary in 2000, the stadium underwent renovations which would increase its full capacity to around 103,000. After years of planning and nine months of closure between 2005 and 2006 (during which Flamengo played their home matches at Volta Redonda&#x27;s Estádio Raulino de Oliveira and Portuguesa&#x27;s Estádio Luso Brasileiro), the stadium was reopened in January 2007 with an all-seated capacity of 87,000. For the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics and Paralympics, a major reconstruction project was initiated in 2010. The original seating bowl, with a two-tier configuration, was demolished, giving way to a new one-tier seating bowl.

The stadium is officially under the management of Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht as of 2013. This has resulted in unfavorable rental agreements for Flamengo who do not officially administer the stadium and often owe rental fees for matches in excess of their ticket revenue, even for matches with high attendance. The most recent rental agreement was signed in 2018 and is valid through 2020. In April 2019, Flamengo and Fluminense came to an agreement with the state and the operators of the Maracanã to serve as joint-managers of the venue for the following six months, a deal which allowed the clubs to pay a fixed monthly fee and receive a higher share of matchday revenue than was granted under the previous deal.

===Ilha do Urubu===
In 2017, Flamengo played their home matches at the Estádio Luso Brasileiro of Portuguesa while disputing their stadium situation with the Rio de Janeiro state government and Complexo Maracanã Entretenimento S.A. (composed of Odebrecht, IMX, AEG), the operator of the Maracanã Stadium. A three-year agreement was signed with Portuguesa over management of Estádio Luso Brasileiro, named Ilha do Urubu (&quot;Vulture&#x27;s Island&quot;) by Flamengo supporters in a poll. The park was renovated to fit 20,500 spectators. Flamengo started playing at the arena in March 2017, but after several delays and administrative issues and a new contract with the Maracanã, Flamengo broke their lease with the Ilha do Urubu in July 2018.

===New Stadium===
In December 2024, it was reported that Flamengo released the design of their new stadium, an 80,000 capacity state-of-the-art stadium to be constructed at the Gasometro area. The stadium is estimated to cost approximately €500 million and once completed, will become the largest stadium in Brazil. Scheduled for completion by November 2029 or earlier, the sports arena includes a North Stand dedicated for its most passionate supporters, luxury seating, a 360 degrees internal LED screen, a massive external display and a total of 6,200 m2 of LED surfaces.

==Rivalries==
===Rivalry with Botafogo===
The match became known as the &quot;Clássico da Rivaldade&quot; (English: &quot;Rivalry Classic&quot;) in the 1960s, is the traditional Brazilian derby between Botafogo and Flamengo, both from Rio de Janeiro.The first confrontation between Rio de Janeiro rivals Flamengo and Botafogo occurred in 1913. Flamengo&#x27;s mascot of the vulture originated during the 1 June 1969, match against Botafogo when Flamengo supporters released a vulture onto the field in response to the racist cheers of &quot;urubu&quot; (vulture) from Botafogo and other teams&#x27; supporters. Flamengo&#x27;s top scorer in the derby is Zico and Botafogo&#x27;s top scorer is Heleno de Freitas.

===Rivalry with Fluminense===

The &quot;Fla-Flu&quot; or &quot;Clássico das Multidões&quot; (English: &quot;Derby of the Crowds&quot;) is the traditional Brazilian derby between Flamengo and Fluminense, both from Rio de Janeiro. It is considered by football experts and much of the sports media as one of the greatest classics in the world. According to writer Nelson Rodrigues, the classic was generated by resentment. On the tricolor side, the fact that their starting players deserted and went to form Flamengo&#x27;s football department, and on the red-black side, the fact that Fluminense still won the first match, circumstances that would have been fundamental in generating the derby mystique.

The rivalry between these two clubs began in October 1911, when a group of dissatisfied players from Fluminense left their club and joined rowing club of Flamengo, establishing the football department at their new club. The first &quot;Fla–Flu&quot; ever was played the following year on July 7. Fluminense won the match 3–2, with 800 people in attendance.

Over time Flamengo and Fluminense became powerhouses of Brazilian football, although with common origins, the clubs became very distinct and in some cases antagonistic. Soon Flamengo became the most popular team in Brazil, with fans mainly in the working and lower classes across the country. While Fluminense becomes a club linked to the rich class of Rio de Janeiro, especially in the south of the city.

In 1950, the Maracanã stadium was built to host the FIFA World Cup, although the four big clubs of Rio de Janeiro play in the stadium, Flamengo and Fluminense are the teams that played the most matches there and currently manage the stadium, which belongs to the state of Rio de Janeiro. The Fla-Flu holds the world record for attendance in games between clubs: 194,603 spectators were present at the Maracanã stadium, in the final of the 1963 Campeonato Carioca, won by Flamengo after a goalless draw.

Flamengo and Fluminense are the two most successful team in the Campeonato Carioca: as of 2023 Flamengo have 37 state league titles and Fluminense have 33. Since 2012, Fla-Flu has been considered an Intangible Heritage of Rio de Janeiro, being the only football derby to deserve this honor.

===Rivalry with Vasco da Gama===

The &quot;Clássico dos Milhões&quot; (English: &quot;Derby of Millions&quot;) is the traditional Brazilian derby between Flamengo and Vasco da Gama, both from Rio de Janeiro. Although the rivalries against Botafogo and Fluminense are more traditional, Vasco is the club most hated by Flamengo supporters and &quot;vice versa&quot;, with the derby between them being considered one of the biggest rivalries in Brazilian football and in football worldwide. The derby&#x27;s name originated in the 1920s and refers to the two largest fanbases in the state of Rio de Janeiro. Both clubs were established in the late 19th century as regatta rowing clubs. The first football match between the clubs was played in 1923 when Vasco entered the top division of the Campeonato Carioca.

From the 1972 to 2001, the matchup was elevated as the most important of Flamengo&#x27;s rivalries and became one of the biggest rivalries in all of Brazil. In this span, Flamengo and Vasco played in or won the final of each of the phases of the state championship nearly every year, frequently facing one another. This also coincided with the beginnings of the national Campeonato Brasileiro and the growth in popularity of both clubs nationwide. The most iconic matches between Flamengo and Vasco featured the idols of both clubs challenging each other: Zico of Flamengo (1971–83; 85–89) and Roberto Dinamite of Vasco da Gama (1971–79; 80–93).

Some of the great players in Brazilian football played for both teams, and with hectic transfers in the 1980s and 1990s. Bebeto revealed by Flamengo, was seen as Zico&#x27;s successor, but left the red-black team and went to play for Vasco in 1989. Romário revealed for Vasco&#x27;s youth teams, when he returned to Brazil in 1995, recently champion of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and elected best player of the year by FIFA, he chose to play for Flamengo. Other players like Andrade, Edmundo, Felipe, Jean, Jorginho, Juninho Paulista, Dejan Petković and Tita.

===Interstate Rivalries===
====Rivalry with Atlético Mineiro====
Flamengo has an inter-state rivalry with Atlético Mineiro of Minas Gerais, developed in the 1980s from numerous controversial encounters between the two clubs in that decade&#x27;s Campeonato Brasileiro and Copa Libertadores editions. It maintained its high intensity through the following years, and is considered one of the biggest interstate rivalries in Brazilian football.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===

Flamengo basketball won the Rio de Janeiro City Championship in 1919 and have since grown to be one of the most successful and supported basketball teams in the country. The club have won six Brazilian Championships, a record 44 Rio de Janeiro State Championships, the 1953 South American Championship of Champions Clubs, and the 2009 South American League.

In 2014, Flamengo won the League of the Americas without a single loss, defeating Pinheiros in the final. This qualified Flamengo to their first Intercontinental Cup against EuroLeague champions Maccabi Tel Aviv. Flamengo won and became the second Brazilian basketball team in history to be world champions. Flamengo, Real Madrid and Barcelona are the only clubs to have won the Intercontinental Cups in both football and basketball.

Flamengo hosted and participated in the 2019 FIBA Intercontinental Cup, falling to BCL champions AEK Athens in the final.

===Women&#x27;s football===
Between 1995 and 2001, the Flamengo women&#x27;s football team competed in the Campeonato Carioca. In 2002 the women&#x27;s Carioca tournament was not organized, and the club ceased operation of the team. Flamengo attempted to re-established their women&#x27;s professional football department in 2011 through a partnership with the city of Guarujá where the team trained and hoped to sign Marta, but the team never materialized. In 2015 president Eduardo Bandeira de Mello succeeded in establishing the football team through a partnership with the Brazilian Navy. In their first season, the team won the women&#x27;s Campeonato Carioca state championship and have won it every season from 2015 to 2019. In 2016 Flamengo won the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino for the first time against Rio Preto, become the only club outside the state of São Paulo to win the tournament since its creation in 2013. Flamengo also competed in the 2016 and 2017 Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino before the cancellation of the competition in favor of the Campeonato Brasileiro.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===
The Flamengo women&#x27;s basketball team won back-to-back Brazilian championships in 1954 and 1955. Ten years later with some of the same players, the program won back-to-back Brazilian titles again in 1964 and 1965. Flamengo players Norminha, Angelina, Marlene and Delei were champions of the 1967 Pan American Games in Winnipeg with the Brazil women&#x27;s national basketball team.

In 1966 Flamengo won the Inter-club Basketball World Championship. The team was led by Angelina, considered one of the best players of her time.

===Rowing===

The &quot;Flamengo Regatta Group&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Flamengo Regatta Club&quot;, was established in 1895 as Flamengo&#x27;s first ever organized athletic department, forming the basis of the club&#x27;s history and identity to this day. The first regatta victory came in 1898 in the Nautical Championship of Brazil, and the first title was won in 1900, the Regatta of the IV Centenary of the Discovery of Brazil, for which the club was awarded the Jug Tropon trophy. In 1905 the club won a classic event, the South American Cup. By 1908, Flamengo had already won 43 gold, 126 silver and 141 bronze medals. The success of the rowing club made the team famous even before the founding of the football department in 1911. Great rowers such as Everardo Paes de Lima, Arnaldo Voigt, Alfredo Correia (&quot;Boca Larga&quot;), Ângelo Gammaro (&quot;Angelú&quot;) and Antônio Rebello Junior (&quot;Engole Garfo&quot;) came through Flamengo, the latter three being considered Brazilian sports heroes for completing the Rio-Santos crossing in 1932.

From 1931 to 1937 Flamengo were seven-time champions of Rio de Janeiro, and were four-time repeat state champions from 1940 to 1943. In 1963 the &quot;Buck era&quot; began, which revolutionized Flamengo rowing. The coach brought in athletes from other states and renovated the club&#x27;s facilities to better accommodate the boats. Buck coached the Brazil national team, directing the team in several international competitions. In the early 1980s, Flamengo won the state championship and won again in 1992. The club has won the men&#x27;s Brazil Trophy 10 times, and the female once, in addition to 45 Carioca state titles.

===Water polo===
Water polo is the second oldest sport practiced by the club, after rowing. The team played their first game on May 27, 1913, in Rio de Janeiro, and defeated Clube Internacional de Regatas, 3–2. Flamengo only opened its water sports facility in 1965. Prior to that, athletes played and trained in the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon or in the sea. Flamengo&#x27;s first polo championship in Rio de Janeiro came in 1985 and was the start of a run of nine consecutive championships through 1993. In 1985 the club won the South American Club Championship and the Brazil Trophy (also won four consecutive times). A female water polo team was established in 1987, winning the Brazil Trophy in 1987 and 1991 and the state championship in 1995.

===American football===
The club launched their American football team in 2013, forming a partnership with the Rio de Janeiro Emperors. The Emperors were established in 2008 and had previously partnered with Fluminense from 2010 to 2013. The team officially goes by the name of the Flamengo Emperors and compete in the BFA (&quot;Brasil Futebol Americano&quot;).

===Tennis===
Flamengo began playing tennis championships in 1916 and became three-time Rio champions soon after (1916–18), even with their athletes training at other clubs. Until 1932 the club practiced tennis on their football field at the Rua Paysandu. In 1963 the club inaugurated their own facilities and courts. The biggest idol of Flamengo&#x27;s tennis department is Thomas Koch.

===E-sports===
In 2017 the club announced they would be entering the increasingly popular e-sports leagues the following year, beginning with a League of Legends department and eventually establishing a PES team. Because the competitive League of Legends center of Brazil is at the Riot Games studio in São Paulo, Flamengo established a permanent &quot;gaming office&quot; for the team in the city. Flamengo announced that they would not be partnering with an existing team but rather would have their own team. In October 2017 they announced the purchase of Merciless Gaming, a team in the second division of the Brazilian League of Legends championship.

<doc id="187240" wikidata="Q50695" url="?curid=187240" title="Quadratic function">
<text>In mathematics, a quadratic function of a single variable is a function of the form
:formula_1
where is its variable, and , , and are coefficients. The expression , especially when treated as an object in itself rather than as a function, is a quadratic polynomial, a polynomial of degree two. In elementary mathematics a polynomial and its associated polynomial function are rarely distinguished and the terms &quot;quadratic function&quot; and &quot;quadratic polynomial&quot; are nearly synonymous and often abbreviated as &quot;quadratic&quot;.

The graph of a real single-variable quadratic function is a parabola. If a quadratic function is equated with zero, then the result is a quadratic equation. The solutions of a quadratic equation are the zeros (or &quot;roots&quot;) of the corresponding quadratic function, of which there can be two, one, or zero. The solutions are described by the quadratic formula.

A quadratic polynomial or quadratic function can involve more than one variable. For example, a two-variable quadratic function of variables and has the form
:formula_2
with at least one of , , and not equal to zero. In general the zeros of such a quadratic function describe a conic section (a circle or other ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola) in the – plane. A quadratic function can have an arbitrarily large number of variables. The set of its zero form a quadric, which is a surface in the case of three variables and a hypersurface in general case.

==Etymology==

The adjective &quot;quadratic&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot; (&quot;square&quot;). A term raised to the second power like is called a square in algebra because it is the area of a &quot;square&quot; with side .

==Terminology==

===Coefficients===
The coefficients of a quadratic function are often taken to be real or complex numbers, but they may be taken in any ring, in which case the domain and the codomain are this ring (see polynomial evaluation).

===Degree===
When using the term &quot;quadratic polynomial&quot;, authors sometimes mean &quot;having degree exactly 2&quot;, and sometimes &quot;having degree at most 2&quot;. If the degree is less than 2, this may be called a &quot;degenerate case&quot;. Usually the context will establish which of the two is meant.

Sometimes the word &quot;order&quot; is used with the meaning of &quot;degree&quot;, e.g. a second-order polynomial. However, where the &quot;degree of a polynomial&quot; refers to the &quot;largest&quot; degree of a non-zero term of the polynomial, more typically &quot;order&quot; refers to the &quot;lowest&quot; degree of a non-zero term of a power series.

===Variables===

A quadratic polynomial may involve a single variable &quot;x&quot; (the univariate case), or multiple variables such as &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; (the multivariate case).

====The one-variable case====

Any single-variable quadratic polynomial may be written as
:formula_3
where &quot;x&quot; is the variable, and &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; represent the coefficients. Such polynomials often arise in a quadratic equation formula_4 The solutions to this equation are called the roots and can be expressed in terms of the coefficients as the quadratic formula. Each quadratic polynomial has an associated quadratic function, whose graph is a parabola.

====Bivariate and multivariate cases====

Any quadratic polynomial with two variables may be written as
:formula_5
where and are the variables and are the coefficients, and one of , and is nonzero. Such polynomials are fundamental to the study of conic sections, as the implicit equation of a conic section is obtained by equating to zero a quadratic polynomial, and the zeros of a quadratic function form a (possibly degenerate) conic section.

Similarly, quadratic polynomials with three or more variables correspond to quadric surfaces or hypersurfaces. 

Quadratic polynomials that have only terms of degree two are called quadratic forms.

==Forms of a univariate quadratic function==
A univariate quadratic function can be expressed in three formats:
* formula_6 is called the standard form,
* formula_7 is called the factored form, where and are the roots of the quadratic function and the solutions of the corresponding quadratic equation.
* formula_8 is called the vertex form, where and are the and coordinates of the vertex, respectively.

The coefficient is the same value in all three forms. To convert the standard form to factored form, one needs only the quadratic formula to determine the two roots and . To convert the standard form to vertex form, one needs a process called completing the square. To convert the factored form (or vertex form) to standard form, one needs to multiply, expand and/or distribute the factors.

==Graph of the univariate function==


Regardless of the format, the graph of a univariate quadratic function formula_9 is a parabola (as shown at the right). Equivalently, this is the graph of the bivariate quadratic equation formula_10.
* If , the parabola opens upwards.
* If , the parabola opens downwards.

The coefficient controls the degree of curvature of the graph; a larger magnitude of gives the graph a more closed (sharply curved) appearance.

The coefficients and together control the location of the axis of symmetry of the parabola (also the -coordinate of the vertex and the &quot;h&quot; parameter in the vertex form) which is at
:formula_11

The coefficient controls the height of the parabola; more specifically, it is the height of the parabola where it intercepts the -axis.

===Vertex===

The vertex of a parabola is the place where it turns; hence, it is also called the turning point. If the quadratic function is in vertex form, the vertex is . Using the method of completing the square, one can turn the standard form
:formula_6
into
: formula_13
so the vertex, , of the parabola in standard form is
: formula_14
If the quadratic function is in factored form
:formula_7
the average of the two roots, i.e.,
: formula_16
is the -coordinate of the vertex, and hence the vertex is
: formula_17

The vertex is also the maximum point if , or the minimum point if .

The vertical line

: formula_18

that passes through the vertex is also the axis of symmetry of the parabola.

====Maximum and minimum points====

Using calculus, the vertex point, being a maximum or minimum of the function, can be obtained by finding the roots of the derivative:
:formula_19
 is a root of if 
resulting in
:formula_20
with the corresponding function value
:formula_21
so again the vertex point coordinates, , can be expressed as
:formula_22

==Roots of the univariate function==


===Exact roots===

The roots (or &quot;zeros&quot;), and , of the univariate quadratic function

: formula_23

are the values of for which .

When the coefficients , , and , are real or complex, the roots are

:formula_24

:formula_25

===Upper bound on the magnitude of the roots===

The modulus of the roots of a quadratic formula_26 can be no greater than formula_27 where formula_28 is the golden ratio formula_29

==The square root of a univariate quadratic function==
The square root of a univariate quadratic function gives rise to one of the four conic sections, almost always either to an ellipse or to a hyperbola.

If formula_30 then the equation formula_31 describes a hyperbola, as can be seen by squaring both sides. The directions of the axes of the hyperbola are determined by the ordinate of the minimum point of the corresponding parabola formula_32 If the ordinate is negative, then the hyperbola&#x27;s major axis (through its vertices) is horizontal, while if the ordinate is positive then the hyperbola&#x27;s major axis is vertical.

If formula_33 then the equation formula_31 describes either a circle or other ellipse or nothing at all. If the ordinate of the maximum point of the corresponding parabola
formula_35 is positive, then its square root describes an ellipse, but if the ordinate is negative then it describes an empty locus of points.

==Iteration==
To iterate a function formula_36, one applies the function repeatedly, using the output from one iteration as the input to the next.

One cannot always deduce the analytic form of formula_37, which means the &quot;n&quot;th iteration of formula_38. (The superscript can be extended to negative numbers, referring to the iteration of the inverse of formula_38 if the inverse exists.) But there are some analytically tractable cases.

For example, for the iterative equation

:formula_40

one has
:formula_41
where
:formula_42 and formula_43
So by induction,
:formula_44
can be obtained, where formula_45 can be easily computed as
:formula_46
Finally, we have
:formula_47

as the solution.

See Topological conjugacy for more detail about the relationship between &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;. And see Complex quadratic polynomial for the chaotic behavior in the general iteration.

The logistic map

:formula_48

with parameter 2&lt;&quot;r&quot;&lt;4 can be solved in certain cases, one of which is chaotic and one of which is not. In the chaotic case &quot;r&quot;=4 the solution is

:formula_49

where the initial condition parameter formula_50 is given by formula_51. For rational formula_50, after a finite number of iterations formula_53 maps into a periodic sequence. But almost all formula_50 are irrational, and, for irrational formula_50, formula_53 never repeats itself – it is non-periodic and exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions, so it is said to be chaotic.

The solution of the logistic map when &quot;r&quot;=2 is

formula_57

for formula_58. Since formula_59 for any value of formula_60 other than the unstable fixed point 0, the term formula_61 goes to 0 as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity, so formula_53 goes to the stable fixed point formula_63

==Bivariate (two variable) quadratic function==

A bivariate quadratic function is a second-degree polynomial of the form
:formula_64
where &quot;A, B, C, D&quot;, and &quot;E&quot; are fixed coefficients and &quot;F&quot; is the constant term.
Such a function describes a quadratic surface. Setting formula_65 equal to zero describes the intersection of the surface with the plane formula_66 which is a locus of points equivalent to a conic section.

===Minimum/maximum===

If formula_67 the function has no maximum or minimum; its graph forms a hyperbolic paraboloid.

If formula_68 the function has a minimum if both and , and a maximum if both and ; its graph forms an elliptic paraboloid. In this case the minimum or maximum occurs at formula_69 where:

:formula_70

:formula_71

If formula_72 and formula_73 the function has no maximum or minimum; its graph forms a parabolic cylinder.

If formula_72 and formula_75 the function achieves the maximum/minimum at a line—a minimum if &quot;A&quot;&gt;0 and a maximum if &quot;A&quot;&lt;0; its graph forms a parabolic cylinder.

<text>The Sport Club Corinthians Paulista () is a Brazilian professional sports club based in São Paulo, in the district of Tatuapé. Although it competes in multiple sports modalities, it is best known for its professional men&#x27;s football team, which plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top tier of Brazilian football, as well as in the Campeonato Paulista Série A1, the first division of the traditional in-state competition.

Founded in 1910 by five railway workers inspired by the London-based Corinthian Football Club, the Sport Club Corinthians Paulista traditionally plays in a white and black home kit. Their crest was first introduced in 1939 by modernist painter and former player Francisco Rebolo, featuring the São Paulo state flag in a shield, two oars, and an anchor, representing the club&#x27;s early success in nautical sports. Corinthians has played their home matches at the Neo Química Arena since 2014, which served as one of the venues for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and also hosted the opening match. The club has longstanding rivalries with Palmeiras (known as &quot;Derby Paulista&quot; or simply &quot;The Derby&quot;), São Paulo (the &quot;Clássico Majestoso&quot;), and Santos (&quot;Clássico Alvinegro&quot;).

One of the most widely supported teams in the world and the second most in Brazil, with over 30 million fans, Corinthians is one of the most successful Brazilian clubs, having won seven national titles, three Copa do Brasil trophies, one Supercopa do Brasil title, and a record 30 São Paulo State championships. In international competitions, the club won the inaugural FIFA Club World Championship in 2000, repeated the feat in 2012 after being crowned Copa Libertadores de América champions for the first time that same year, and also won a Recopa Sudamericana title. In 2017, the club was listed by &quot;Forbes&quot; as the most valuable football club in the Americas, valued at $576.9 million.

==History==


In 1910, the top clubs were formed by people who were part of the upper classes. Among them were Club Athletico Paulistano, São Paulo Athletic Club, &amp; Associação Atlética das Palmeiras. Lower-class society, excluded from larger clubs due to the socioeconomic division, founded their own minnow clubs and only played &quot;floodplain&quot; football.

Bucking the trend, a group of five workers of the São Paulo Railway, them being, Joaquim Ambrose and Anthony Pereira (wall painters), Rafael Perrone (shoemaker), Anselmo Correia (driver) and Carlos Silva (general laborer), residents of the neighborhood of Bom Retiro. It was 31 August 1910 when these workers were watching a match featuring a London-based club touring Brazil, Corinthian F.C. After the match, while the group returned home, the men talked about partnerships, business ideas, and general dreams of grandeur. They each surfaced one idea: the foundation of a club, after several exchanges in a lively argument, a common ground led those athletes the same dream. The arguments led to the conclusion that they would meet the next day to make their dream into reality.

On 1 September 1910, the group agreed to meet after sundown in public sight. That night at 20:30 BRT (23:30 GMT), on Rua José Paulino (&quot;Rua dos Imigrantes&quot;; Immigrants Street), the five workers reunited alongside their guest and neighbors from Bom Retiro. That night the club was founded, alongside its board of directors, who elected Miguel Battaglia as the first Club President.

Corinthians played their first match on 10 September 1910, away against União da Lapa, a respected amateur club in São Paulo, and they were defeated by 1–0.

On 14 September, Luis Fabi scored Corinthians&#x27; first goal against &quot;Estrela Polar&quot;, another amateur club in the city, and Corinthians won their first game (2–0).

With good results and an increasing number of supporters, Corinthians joined the Liga Paulista, after winning two qualifying games, and played in the São Paulo State Championship for the first time, in 1913. Just one year after joining the league, Corinthians was crowned champion for the first time (in 1914), and were again two years later. There were many fly-by-night teams popping up in São Paulo at the time, and during the first practice held by Corinthians a banner was placed by the side of the field stating &quot;This One Will Last&quot;.

1922, the Centennial of Brazilian Independence, marks the start of Corinthians hegemony in the São Paulo State Championship. As football was almost exclusively played at Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo by that time, the two state champions were considered to be the two top clubs in Brazil. After defeating the Rio de Janeiro State Championship champion of that year, América, Corinthians joined the company of the great teams in Brazil.

The same year also marked the first of three State Championships in a row, something that happened again in 1928–30 and 1937–39.

Corinthians seemed destined to win State Championships in threes; after six years without being a champions, they came won three more from 1937 the 1939. The 1940s were a more difficult time; and the club would win a championship in 1941 and would only win their next in 1951.

At the beginning of the 1950s Corinthians made history in the São Paulo Championship. In 1951, the team composed of Carbone, Cláudio, Luisinho, Baltasar and Mário scored 103 goals in thirty matches of the São Paulo Championship, registering an average of 3.43 per game. Carbone was the top goal-scorer of the competition with 30 goals. The club would also win the São Paulo Championships of 1952 and 1954. In this same decade, Corinthians were champions three times of the Rio-São Paulo Championship (1950, 1953 and 1954), the tournament that was becoming most important in the country with the increased participation of the greatest clubs from the two most important footballing states in the country.

In 1953, in a championship in Venezuela, Corinthians won the Small Cup of the World, a championship that many consider as a precursor of the Worldwide Championship of Clubs. On the occasion, Corinthians, substituting for Vasco da Gama, went to Caracas, the Venezuelan capital and recorded six consecutive victories against Roma (1–0 and 3–1), Barcelona (3–2 and 1–0) and Selection of Caracas (2–1 and 2–0). The club would also win the Cup of the Centenary of São Paulo, in the same year (1954).

After the triumphs in the São Paulo Championship and the Rio-São Paulo of 1954, Corinthians had a lengthy title drought. The breakthrough finally came when they won the São Paulo state championship in 1977, breaking a string of 23 years without a major title.

Under the leadership of Sócrates, Wladimir and Casagrande, Corinthians were the first Brazilian club in which players decided about concentração, a common Brazilian practice where the football players were locked up in a hotel days before a game, and discussed politics. (In the early 1980s, military dictatorship, after two decades, ended in Brazil). In 1982, before the election of government of São Paulo State, the team wore a kit with the words: &quot;DIA 15 VOTE&quot; (Vote on 15th), trying to motivate the biggest number of fans to vote.

In 1990, Corinthians won their first Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, beating their rivals, São Paulo in the final at the opponents&#x27; own stadium, Estádio do Morumbi. In the following year, Corinthians beat Flamengo and won the Supercopa do Brasil. In the 1995, the club won the Copa do Brasil for the first time, beating Grêmio in the final at the Estádio Olímpico Monumental in Porto Alegre. In the same decade, the club won the state championship in 1995, 1997 and 1999, and won the national championship again in 1998 and in 1999. In 2000, the club won the first FIFA Club World Cup, eliminating Real Madrid in the semifinals and beating Vasco da Gama on penalties in the final.

In 2002 the club won the Rio-São Paulo Tournament, and the Copa do Brasil in 2002, beating Brasiliense in the final.

The club&#x27;s situation in early 2004 was among the most difficult in their history. Bad administration, lack of money and terrible campaigns both in the 2003 Brazilian Championship and in the 2004 São Paulo State Championship caused their millions of supporters to worry. Fortunately, some young players and a new manager Tite helped the team to improve from their terrible start. At the end of the championship, Corinthians finished in 5th place and gained entry to the Copa Sudamericana (a minor continental championship, similar to Europa League).

This situation was one of the factors which enabled Corinthians&#x27; president, Alberto Dualib, to convince the club&#x27;s advisors to sign a controversial deal with an international fund of investors called Media Sports Investment. The deal granted the company a large degree of control over the club for 10 years in exchange for large financial investments in return. This has brought many quality players to the team, such as Carlos Tevez, Roger, Javier Mascherano and Carlos Alberto.

Despite the MSI investments, Corinthians experienced a slow start in the 2005 state championship, but managed to improve as it progressed, eventually managing to finish second. Their start to the Brazilian championship during 2005 was difficult, too, but after Daniel Passarella&#x27;s dismissal (due to an unexpected 5–1 loss to Corinthians&#x27; rivals, São Paulo), the club finished the championship round well, and were eventually crowned Brazilian Champions for the fourth time, after a controversial annulment of eleven games due to a betting scandal. Tevez went on to win the Brazilian League Best Player award.

The relationship between Corinthians&#x27; managers and the MSI president, Kia Joorabchian was not good, and after being eliminated in the Copa Libertadores, the club experienced a crisis which was responsible for the bad performances for the rest of 2006. Eventually, the partnership came to an end.

On 2 December 2007, following a 1–1 draw away to Grêmio, Corinthians were relegated to the second division for the first time in the club history.
Corinthians, who won promotion to the top division of Brazilian football for 2009 by winning the Serie B tournament in 2008, with the best campaign in the history of the tournament, signed with three-time FIFA Player of the Year, Ronaldo. In 2009, led by Ronaldo, Corinthians won their 26th Campeonato Paulista and their third Brazilian Cup. Confirming the club&#x27;s good moment, and the 100 years of the club, Corinthians announced the construction of their new stadium, Arena Corinthians, they finished the Campeonato Brasileiro 2010 in 3rd place, granting their place on the subsequent Copa Libertadores.
After being eliminated from the South American tournament by the country rivals, Flamengo, though, Corinthians saw Ronaldo retire from football. To replace him, the club signed the with Inter Milan legend, Adriano. In 2011, Corinthians once again were eliminated in the Copa Libertadores, but this time in the playoff round by Deportes Tolima. After that, the team went on to win their fifth national title.

On 4 July, after reaching the final of the 2012 Copa Libertadores undefeated, Corinthians won its first title after a two-match final against 6-time champions Boca Juniors by drawing 1–1 in Argentina and winning 2–0 at the Estádio do Pacaembu in São Paulo, becoming the ninth Brazilian side to win the Copa Libertadores. The club won the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup after defeating English club Chelsea 1–0 on 16 December 2012.

In 2015, the team started the year by being eliminated in the Campeonato Paulista semifinal, and then being eliminated in Libertadores and Brazilian Cup last 16, but went on to win their sixth league title. In 2017 the team started the year winning the Campeonato Paulista for the 28th time, and ending the year winning the league title for the second time in three years, and doing a historic campaign by not losing in the first 20 games of the season. In 2018, the team won the Campeonato Paulista for the 29th time, this time against their biggest rivals, Palmeiras. In 2019, Corinthians won the Campeonato Paulista for the 30th time.

In 2020, Corinthians lost the Campeonato Paulista final to arch rivals Palmeiras on penalties. In the league they finished only 10 points ahead of the first team in the relegation zone, that was the first season since 2007 that Corinthians fought against relegation. In 2021 the new president of the club brought back Willian who had left the club in 2007, helping Corinthians to finish in 5th, granting the club to the Copa Libertadores playoffs. In 2022 Corinthians had their best league season since 2017, finishing in 4th place, granting their place on the subsequent Copa Libertadores. In the Libertadores, the team finished in 2nd in the group stage, then went on to eliminate Boca Juniors in La Bombonera on penalties, reaching the quarter finals for the first time since 2012, but were eliminated to Flamengo. In the Brazilian Cup, they lost once again to Flamengo, but this time at the final, on a penalty shoot out. After all, it was considered the club&#x27;s best season since 2017.

In 2023, despite being eliminated from Libertadores, the club reached the Copa Sulamericana semifinals, where they were eliminated by Fortaleza. In the league once again fought against relegation.

==Visual identity==
===Colours===
Even though the club has been recognized by the colors black and white for most of their history, the first Corinthians&#x27; kit originally consisted of cream shirts and black shorts. Back then, the choice of colors proved wrong, as the cream color would gradually fade white when the shirts were washed, representing a cost a recently created club could not afford. Thus, early after the foundation, the official shirt colors were changed to white. In 1954 the traditional black with thin white stripes uniform was introduced, and became the alternative uniform since then.

===Badge===
The Corinthians shirt had no badge or crest until 1913, when the club joined the Liga Paulista, that mandated that every club in the competition should have one in their uniforms. A simple composition of the letters C (Corinthians) and P (Paulista) was hastily created and embroidered on the players uniforms for the upcoming matches, thus being considered the club&#x27;s first &quot;de facto&quot; badge.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORINTHIANS-1913/LANCE-2010&quot;&gt;1913: Nasce o Mosqueteiro corintiano - Lance1, 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the kit, the badge went through several changes over the years. In 1914, lithographer Hermogenes Barbuy, brother of then-player Amilcar Barbuy designed the club&#x27;s first official badge, which premiered at a friendly against Torino (Italy), in São Paulo.&lt;ref name=&quot;CORINTHIANS-1914/LANCE-2010&quot;&gt;1914 - O primeiro título e o primeiro ídolo - Lance!, 29 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, the round shield with the São Paulo state flag was introduced, and modified in 1939 by modernist painter Francisco Rebolo, a former reserve player of the club in the 1920s, to include a string, an anchor and two oars, representing the early success the club achieved in nautical sports. Thereafter, the badge passed through small changes over time, specifically in the flag and in the frame.

In 1990, a yellow star was added above the badge to celebrate Corinthians&#x27; first national title. The same would occur when achieving the national titles in 1998, 1999 and 2005, and a larger star was introduced in 2000 after winning the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup. The stars remained as part of the badge until 2011, when the board decided the badge would not present any stars in the future.

==Facilities==
===Stadiums===
====Early grounds====
The first playing ground Corinthians used was located in the neighborhood of Bom Retiro (where the club was founded in 1910), in a vacant lot owned by a firewood seller, from which it got its nickname: Campo do Lenheiro (&quot;Lumberjack&#x27;s field&quot;). It was the time of the floodplain and the players themselves had to clean and flatten the lawn.

In January 1918, Corinthians inaugurated its first official football field, Ponte Grande, on the banks of Tiete River. The land was leased from the municipality under the influence of the intellectual Antonio de Alcantara Machado, one of the first to approach the club workers. It was built by the players and fans in a community helping system. The Corinthians played their games there until 1927, upon the completion of their first stadium. It was then donated to São Bento.

====Parque São Jorge====
In 1926, the club purchased Parque São Jorge (&quot;Saint George&#x27;s Park&quot;), located within the Tatuapé district of the city, belonging to then rivals Esporte Clube Sírio, After purchasing, President Ernesto Cassano decided to reform the stage, with financial support from the members.

The renovated Parque São Jorge, still without floodlights, was inaugurated on 22 July, in a friendly game against América-RJ that ended in a 2-2 draw. The land purchased included a Syrian farm - hence the nickname Fazendinha (&quot;Little Farm&quot;), still used today. It was from here that the Corinthians began to develop and could build up its headquarters.

Due to their growing number of fans, Estádio Alfredo Schürig (the official name of &quot;Fazendinha&quot;) and the commissioning of city-owned Pacaembu in the 1940s, from the 1950s the stadium was mostly used for Academy level competitions and friendly matches. The last first team match played there was a friendly against Brasiliense on 3 August 2002. Since 1997, it is also the home ground of the professional women&#x27;s football team.

====Pacaembu====
The club has established a relationship with Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium, which belongs to the municipality of São Paulo and is best known as Pacaembu Stadium, inaugurated in 1940 as the largest stadium in Latin America with a capacity of more than 70,000 people, in a double-fixture that pitted rivals Palestra Italia against Coritiba in the preliminary match and then current three-time state champion Corinthians against Atlético Mineiro, in a match Corinthians won by 4–2. Currently, the Pacaembu has capacity for up to 40,000 spectators.

====Arena Corinthians====
In 2009 there were some conjectures that the government of São Paulo could make a deal for a 30-year allotment of Pacaembu, but it never materialized, even though it was the club&#x27;s directors preference, with projects designed to that matter.

After the Estádio do Morumbi, then named as the city&#x27;s host in the World Cup, failed to comply to FIFA&#x27;s standards, a new project to create a home for Corinthians emerged as a possibility. In August 2010 the president of the CBF, Ricardo Teixeira, along with Governor of São Paulo state, Alberto Goldman, and the mayor of São Paulo, Gilberto Kassab announced that the opening ceremony of the World Cup of Brazil would be held in the new Corinthians Stadium to be built in the district of Itaquera, in the eastern part of São Paulo city.

On 1 September 2020 (Corinthians&#x27; 110th anniversary) a special event live from the stadium was held to announce the Arena&#x27;s new name. It was officially renamed Neo Química Arena, part of a 20-year partnership with Hypera Pharma, Brazil&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical company. Neo Química is Hypera&#x27;s generic drugs division, which already served as Corinthians&#x27; main sponsor during the 2010 and 2011 seasons. The full contract is expected to be around R$300–320 million.

===Training facilities===
====CT Joaquim Grava====
Corinthians inaugurated their state-of-the-art training facilities in September, 2010 during the celebrations of the club&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The training facilities were named after long-time associate and consulting medical doctor, Joaquim Grava, that oversaw the medical department construction.

The training facilities feature a 32 bedroom hotel for the players, a bio-mechanics complex (Lab Corinthians-R9. named after Brazilian legend Ronaldo), a center for player rehabilitation and therapy (CePROO, named after fan and journalist Osmar de Oliveira), basketball and volleyball courts (approved by FIBA and FIVB for official matches), as well as other amenities.

An extension to be used by the Academy teams is currently under construction.

==Club culture==
===Supporters===

The Corinthians fan base is fondly called the Fiel (&quot;Faithful&quot;), starring memorable moments like the &quot;Corinthian Invasion&quot; (pt / &quot;Invasão Corinthiana&quot;) in 1976, when more than 70,000 Corinthians Fans traveled from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro to watch the match against Fluminense at Maracanã Stadium, in that year&#x27;s national championship semifinals, as well as having one of the biggest average attendances in the country. Fans being famous for being passionate about the team and loyal supporters motivated the club to make a tribute documentary to their fans, named &quot;Faithful&quot; (pt / &quot;Fiel&quot;), highlighting the fans&#x27; support in one of the most difficult moments in the club&#x27;s history: the relegation to national second division in 2007. Similar initiatives would be made in the next years, reflecting other moments in the club&#x27;s history in that the fanbase was essential.

Integral to the club culture are the fan organizations (&quot;torcidas organizadas&quot;) such as Gaviões da Fiel (&quot;The Hawks of the Faithful&quot;), founded in 1969 by fans attempting to recover political and administrative control of the club and now the largest of such organizations in Brazil with almost 100,000 associates. Camisa 12 (&quot;The 12th Shirt&quot;, founded in 1971), Estopim da Fiel (&quot;Faithful&#x27;s Fuse&quot;, 1979), Coringão Chopp (&quot;Corinthians Draught Beer&quot;, 1989), Pavilhão Nove (&quot;Pavillion Nine&quot;, 1990), and Fiel Macabra (&quot;Macabre Faithful&quot;, 1993) are other important fan organizations that have been actively supporting social and cultural activities representing the club.

Many of the groups above have established branches for fans living outside of São Paulo city, out-state and even internationally. Most are also involved in the Brazilian Carnival festivities, most famously Gaviões da Fiel, one of the most important Carnival of São Paulo samba schools, having won the contest 4 times, the most among groups of football supporters.

===Rivalries===
====Derby Paulista====

Derby Paulista is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and Palmeiras, consistently cited as one of the greatest rivalries worldwide by sources including FIFA and CNN. Palmeiras was founded by a group of Italians who were formerly members of Corinthians. Since 1914, when that treasonous act was taken upon these former supporters, a deep-seated hatred was born. The Derby atmosphere is fierce on and off the pitch, as violence is common between the clubs.

====Clássico Majestoso====
Clássico Majestoso is a crosstown fixture between Corinthians and São Paulo. The Derby dates back to 1935, at the final re-founding São Paulo after being thrice defunct. Corinthians possesses the largest number of supporters in the state (25 million), whereas São Paulo&#x27;s lies in second place (16 Million). The Clássico&#x27;s most memorable match for Corinthians is the 1990 Campenato Brasileiro finals, which led to Corinthians first national title.

====Clássico Alvinegro====
Clássico Alvinegro is a regional fixture between Corinthians and Santos. &#x27;Alvinegro&#x27; is given after the colors worn by both teams, black and white (&quot;Alvi&quot;, from Latin &quot;albus&quot;, white, and &quot;negro&quot;, black). The Classico reached one of its highest stages for Corinthians supporters when Corinthians met Santos in the Semi-Finals of Libertadores 2012. Corinthians won 2-1 on aggregate.

====Other rivalries====
Derby dos Invictos (Derby of the Undefeated), Corinthians and Portuguesa is a crosstown rivalry. Corinthians vs Ponte Preta is an in-state rivalry that peaked in the 1977 Campeonato Paulista final, which led to Ponte Preta&#x27;s greatest Paulista Finish (runner-up). Classico das Multidões (Classic of The Masses) is an inter-state rivalry pegging the two most supported teams in Brazil: Corinthians and Flamengo. Corinthians and Vasco led to great match ups and some rivalry recently, mostly after Vasco winning the Brasileirão in 1997 and 2000, and Corinthians in 1998 and 1999. Their greatest match coincided with the first FIFA Club World Cup in 2000, with a Corinthians victory in the penalty shootout. Corinthians also won the 2011 Brasileirão in the last round of the season, two points over the runners-up Vasco. Corinthians saved Vasco from their usual runner-up fate by defeating the cariocas in 2012 Libertadores Quarter-finals.

===Symbology===
====Musketeer====
Corinthians&#x27; official mascot is the Musketeer, a symbol of bravery, audacity and fighting spirit. The adoption of that character recalls the first years of the club.

In 1913 most of the leading football clubs in São Paulo State founded the APEA (Paulista Athletic Sports Association). The depleted Paulista League was left with only Americano, Germania and Internacional, known as the &quot;three musketeers&quot; of São Paulo football. Corinthians joined the three as D&#x27;Artagnan, being the fourth and most adored musketeer, just like in Alexandre Dumas, père&#x27;s novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. To be accepted in that &quot;musketeers universe&quot;, Corinthians had to show their bravery. As there was many other teams who coveted the spot in the Liga Paulista, Corinthians participated in a selective tournament against Minas Gerais and São Paulo, two other great teams of Paulista amateur football at that time. The Corinthian team beat Minas 1–0 and São Paulo 4–0, earning acceptance into the group and acquiring the right to participate in the Special Division of the Paulista League in the following year.

====Saint George====
An important symbol for Corinthians is Saint George/(Ogum). Saint George is one of the most revered Catholic Saints in Brazil, a nation with a blend of cultures. The collusion between African &amp; European cultures is seen in Brazil&#x27;s definition of São Jorge as a mash between Catholicism &amp; Western African Mythology. The comparison may be drawn the entities similar characteristics; St George, the soldier who protects those who pray to him; Ogum God of War who serves the communities who believe in him. it is this warrior demeanor that made Corinthians fans indebted to São Jorge.

Corinthians began as a small team for the lower classes of São Paulo, even though they obtained initial success. Lack of respect for the working class forced Corinthians to leave their São Paulo State Football League in protest. after multiple championships Timão made its largest leap in prestige in the founding of a Corinthians&#x27; Headquarters, 1926. The creation of said headquarters became the first fusion of Timão &amp; São Jorge. The land purchased for the headquarters was formerly Parque São Jorge (St. George Park) at 777 Rua São Jorge, Tatuapé, São Paulo, SP.

Corinthians support for São Jorge became fanatical during the decade of the 60&#x27;s, Between 1954 and 1977, Corinthians failed to add to its gallery of conquests and the Corinthian Nation lived the hardest moments of its history. While the stream struggled in the 60&#x27;s, fan recanted that they were blessed by a &quot;Santo Guerreiro&quot; (Warrior Saint). In the early 60&#x27;s the lack of success lingered in the minds of fans &amp; gave birth to a utilization of the blessings of São Jorge. this caused Corinthians to erect a chapel in honor of the saint, in order to strengthen the clubs resolve via mysticism. 1969, after the death of two players Lidu &amp; Eduardo, the funeral was held in Capela São Jorge, &amp; strengthened the clubs identity at a time when championships were non-existent. 1974 Paulista Final, after a heart-wrenching loss to arch-rival Palmeiras, composer Paulinho Nogueira recorded &quot;Oh Corinthians&quot;, a song that had popular commercial success at the time. In the verses of the composition dedicated to the suffering Corinthians could not miss the quote to the patron Saint George:

&quot;...Oh, são 20 anos de espera. Mas meu São Jorge me dê forças, para poder um dia enfim, descontar meu sofrimento em quem riu de mim&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;(&quot;... Oh, It&#x27;s been 20 years of waiting, but my St. George gives me strength to be able to one day finally cashing in my suffering upon those who laughed at me.&quot;)&quot;

Corinthians&#x27; 2011 third kit was burgundy colored &amp; featured São Jorge slaughtering a dragon in a dark watermark across the right side of the chest. The utilization of São Jorge&#x27;s image on the shirt is the practice of São Jorge&#x27;s Prayer.

<text>The head of government of Liechtenstein (), known informally as the prime minister, is the chief executive of the Government of Liechtenstein and chairs the cabinet of Liechtenstein. They are appointed by the sovereign prince of Liechtenstein with the consent of the Landtag of Liechtenstein (parliament of Liechtenstein) and are expected to command the confidence of both the prince and the Landtag. The appointed head of government is typically the leader of the political party with the most seats in the Landtag or a coalition of parties. The head of government cannot be a member of the Landtag at the same time, although they should meet the eligibility requirements for that office. 

The position originated as in the 16th century. The role functioned as the head of the district office (), subordinate to the court of House of Liechtenstein. It was originally an undesired post within the court; this changed after applied for the role in 1833. The title was changed to governor () as a concession following the Revolution of 1848 in Liechtenstein and was formalized upon the ratification of the 1862 constitution of Liechtenstein on 26 September. For this reason, Menzinger is considered the first governor of Liechtenstein. In 1921, a new constitution was ratified in which the office was replaced by that of the prime minister. Under this constitution, the eligibility for becoming head of government was changed to require being natural-born in Liechtenstein. However, this requirement has been considered inactive since 1992.

The incumbent prime minister has been Daniel Risch since 25 March 2021. There are currently five living former prime ministers, with Walter Kieber being the most recent death, in 2014.

<text>The Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras (), commonly known as Palmeiras, is a Brazilian professional football club based in the city of São Paulo, in the district of Perdizes. Palmeiras is one of the most popular clubs in South America, with an approximate 21 million supporters and 198,656 affiliated fans. Despite being primarily a football club, Palmeiras competes in a number of different sports. The football team plays in the Campeonato Paulista, the state of São Paulo&#x27;s premier state league, as well as in the Brasileirão Série A, the top tier of the Brazilian football league system.

The Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras was founded by Italian immigrants on 26 August 1914, as &quot;Palestra Itália&quot; (). However, the club changed its name on 14 September 1942, as a result of Brazil joining the Allies in the Second World War against Italy (&quot;Itália&quot; in Portuguese) and the Axis powers. Since then, Palmeiras has won 18 top-tier national competitions, including a record 12 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, 4 Copas do Brasil, 1 Copa dos Campeões, and 1 Supercopa do Brasil making it the most successful club in top-tier domestic competitions in Brazil. In international club football, the &quot;Verdão&quot; (Big Green One) has won the first ever international tournament known as Copa Rio in 1951, the 1999, 2020 and 2021 Copa Libertadores, the 2022 Recopa Sudamericana, and the 1998 Copa Mercosul. The club has also been successful at a regional level as they have won 5 Interstate titles (Torneio Rio – São Paulo), and 26 State Championship titles (Campeonato Paulista).

Palmeiras currently occupies the second position on CBF and the first position CONMEBOL rankings, and was the first Brazilian club to win the IFFHS Men&#x27;s Club World Ranking in 2021.

The squads for all five FIFA World Cups and two Olympic gold medals won by Brazil have had at least one Palmeiras player in them, an honour shared with cross-city rivals São Paulo.

==History==


===Foundation===
At the beginning of the 20th century, several young Italians decided to start a club whose main goal was to form a football team that would be representative of the Italian community, and face the big names of São Paulo&#x27;s football elite. Just over three decades earlier, Italy had been unified – a fact that was not known to some Italian-Brazilians and to some non-Italian Brazilians.

There were numerous Italian clubs, but each one represented an Italian province or was geared to activities other than football. At the time, the game was starting to take hold and drew many players and fans.

The founders of the club sought out the &quot;Fanfulla&quot; newspaper, which was the media outlet that defended the interests of Italians in Brazil, and entrusted young Vincenzo Ragognetti – another supporter of the idea – to draft an invitation to those interested in forming a sports club.

After several meetings, 46 interested individuals (led by Luigi Marzo and Luigi Cervo) gathered at the Alhambra Room on what is now Rua do Riachuelo, and founded a sports club for all Italian-Brazilians named &quot;Palestra Italia&quot; on 26 August 1914. Ezequiel Simone was named club president. The Italian Consulate in São Paulo became interested in the new club because it would help spread the word among Italians that their country now had one flag and one anthem.

After some initial difficulties, Palestra Italia played its first game in the town of Votorantim (São Paulo State) – beating Savoia 2–0 with goals from Bianco and Alegretti to win the Taça Savoia, the club&#x27;s first title.
===1920–1945: First state title and new stadium===
In 1916, the team joined the city&#x27;s main sports league and played its first official championship match. The following year it would be runner-up in the São Paulo State Championship, facing Corinthians for the first time. Palestra won that initial game 3–0 with three goals from Caetano; it also won the rematch 3–1 of what would become the team&#x27;s chief rivalry. In 1920, Palestra Italia captured the São Paulo State championship with a victory over the rugged Paulistano squad in the deciding match.

Palestra continued to grow as a sports club and also began acquiring more assets. Estádio Palestra Itália, purchased in 1920, was remodeled and expanded in 1933, when it became the first Brazilian stadium with concrete grandstands and barbed-wire fences. Starting in 1964, the playing field would be suspended, which gave fans a complete, broad view and also created space in the lower levels.

The club continued to grow and win more championships, and at the outset of the 1930s became the three-time São Paulo State football and basketball champion – a feat that prompted Palestra fans to chant in celebration: &quot;With the feet or with the hands, Palestra is the best in the land.&quot;

===A Leader Dies, A Champion is Born===


In 1942 during World War II, the government of President Getúlio Vargas issued a decree banning any organization from using names related to the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan). Palestra Italia was forced to change its name and became Palestra São Paulo (&quot;palestra&quot; is a Greek word, loosely translated as &quot;gymnasium,&quot; which therefore did not violate this rule). However, the change still did not soothe political and sporting pressures to alter the name completely. At risk of forfeiting all its assets to other clubs and being ejected from the championship that it currently led, Palestra was forced to change its name a second time. The night before the last game of the state championship, scheduled for 20 September 1942, the Palestra board of directors held a heated meeting and changed the club&#x27;s name. When the debate reached its peak, Dr. Mario Minervino took the floor and asked club Secretary, Dr. Pascoal W. Byron Giuliano, to note in the minutes:

– &quot;They don&#x27;t want us to be Palestra, so then we shall be Palmeiras – born to be champions.&quot;

Tensions flared during the final league match, where Palmeiras&#x27;s opponent was São Paulo Futebol Clube (SPFC), which was laying claim to the assets of the former Palestra Italia.

Palmeiras took the field carrying the Brazilian flag under the leadership of army Captain Adalberto Mendes. Palmeiras was leading the match by 3–1 when a penalty was given in its favor. At that moment, the SPFC ordered its players to consider the Palmeiras squad an enemy of the homeland and pulled its side off the field amid jeers from even the club&#x27;s own fans. The celebrations began on the spot. The next day, newspapers contained a photograph of Palmeiras entering the field with the headline: &quot;A Leader Dies, A Champion is Born.&quot;

===Copa Rio: recognition as world champions===
In January 1951, the Brazilian sports newspaper &quot;O Globo Sportivo&quot; ran a lead story reporting that FIFA President Jules Rimet would grant unconditional support to holding a world club championship in Rio de Janeiro.

The first Copa Rio was held in 1951, with the participation of eight squads, divided into two brackets of four teams apiece: Vasco da Gama (Brazil), Austria Vienna (Austria), Nacional (Uruguay), and Sporting CP (Portugal), playing in Rio; and Palmeiras (Brazil), Juventus (Italy), Red Star (Yugoslavia), and Olympique (France) playing in São Paulo. 
Clubs such as Malmo, Rapid Vienna, Tottenham, Newcastle, Barcelona, Lousanne were invited to participate in the tournament, but they were not interested, and preferred to participate in the Latin Cup with teams such as Milan and Atletico de Madrid. The importance of the 1951 Copa Rio is linked to the fact that it was the first interclub competition with worldwide coverage, having been created even before the Intercontinental Cup. The competition was organized by the Brazilian Sports Confederation, with aid and authorization from FIFA, and was sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro. As a result, FIFA states that Palmeiras is the de facto holder of the title of the first worldwide club competition in history, by stating in the 2022 competition that Palmeiras already had a title. But by 2022, the official page of the international clubs in the FIFA official website, only reported winners from 2000 to 2022, so Palmeiras would not be considered the 1951 winner. Two editions of the Copa Rio took place in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil in 1951; Palmeiras was the winner of the tournament while Fluminense, also a co-organizer of the 1952 event, won in 1952. While FIFA statute did establish that official international competitions could only be organized by FIFA or continental confederations, this rule was only effective as of 1955, so this was not the case for the Copa Rio, which was organized by the Brazilian Federation. Palmeiras has requested several times that FIFA officially recognize this tournament as a Club World Cup, but as of yet to no avail. 

In 2006, Palmeiras prepared a document for FIFA, describing the 1951 Copa Rio in detail, in order to request official confirmation of their victory as the first ever club football world championship. The document argued that the participation of FIFA officials Stanley Rous and Ottorino Barassi in the organization of the 1951 competition was a clear indication of FIFA&#x27;s blessing, and that FIFA had sent Barassi to represent FIFA in the organization of the tournament. Rous and Barassi were primarily involved in negotiations with European clubs, while Barassi also helped organize the framework of the competition. In a 1951 interview, however, FIFA President Jules Rimet praised the Brazilian initiative, but denied any FIFA involvement in or responsibility for it.

In May 2007, Palmeiras received a letter from FIFA, signed by then Secretary-General Urs Linsi, recognizing Palmeiras as club world champions of 1951. However, FIFA president Sepp Blatter later declared that the matter was still being evaluated.

In April 2013, FIFA General-Secretary Jérôme Valcke, again recognized Palmeiras as champions of the &quot;&quot;first Club World Cup ever held&quot; in written communication to the Brazilian Minister of Sports, Aldo Rebelo.
FIFA Executive Committee recognized Palmeiras as champions of the &quot;first worldwide club competition&quot;&quot; in 2014, while, FIFA president Joseph Blatter stated to the Brazilian press that Palmeiras&#x27;s victory had been effectively recognized by FIFA and they should therefore be considered club world champions.

On 22 July 2016, FIFA celebrated the 65-year anniversary of the 1951 Copa Rio title won by Palmeiras. On Instagram, FIFA posted: &quot;&quot;Green is the color of envy. &#x27;The Big Green Ones&#x27; were the envy of the world on this day 65 years ago. A Liminha-inspired Palmeiras edged a Juventus team including Giampiero Boniperti &amp; a Danish triumvirate to become the sport&#x27;s first intercontinental world club champions. 100,000 watched that at the Maracanã. One million flooded the streets of São Paulo to welcome their heroes home&quot;.&quot;

A distinction between a &quot;worldwide competition&quot; (&quot;worldwide in reach but that does not necessarily indicate the world champion&quot;) and a &quot;competition awarding the label of world champion&quot; rose in January 2017, when FIFA issued the following statement: &quot;&quot;At its meeting in São Paulo on 7 June 2014 the FIFA Executive Committee agreed to the request presented by CBF to acknowledge the 1951 tournament between European and South American clubs as the first worldwide club competition, and Palmeiras as its winner. FIFA acknowledges and values the initiatives to establish worldwide club competitions throughout history. This is the case of tournaments involving European and South American clubs, such as the pioneering Copa Rio, played in 1951 and 1952, and the Intercontinental Cup. However, it was not until 2000 that FIFA organised the maiden FIFA Club World Cup, with representatives from all six confederations. The winners of this competition, which went on to be staged annually from 2005 onwards, are the ones officially considered by FIFA as club world champions&quot;.

On 27 October 2017, the FIFA Council changed its position: while not promoting the statistical unification of the Intercontinental Cup and the Club World Cup, in respect to the history of the two tournaments (which merged in 2005), it made the Intercontinental Cup an official world title, recognizing all its winners as club world champions with the same title as FIFA Club World Cup winners: &quot;FIFA Club World Champions.&quot;
In April 2019, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, in an interview with Brazilian media, reiterated FIFA&#x27;s perspective that only the winners of the Intercontinental Cup and the Club World Cup were officially world champions. Also in April 2019, former FIFA president Joseph Blatter (who held office until December 2015) again stated to the Brazilian press that Palmeiras had been recognized as world club champions by FIFA in 2014.

In February 2021, the FIFA website praised Palmeiras&#x27;s victory in the Copa Rio thus: 

In any case, the Copa Rio was the first intercontinental football tournament to bring together the most prestigious clubs from the most important leagues around the world. The matches were played at the same locations in which the 1950 FIFA World Cup games had been played the year before. The tournament triggered discussions within continental football federations about exploring club football internationally, which eventually led to the launch of international championshipssuch as the European Cup (now known as the UEFA Champions League) and the Copa Libertadores.

In the end, Palmeiras won the first intercontinental championship of the pre-international era of football, making the &#x27;Copa Rio&#x27; one of the most important starting points of globalization for football. The &#x27;Copa Rio&#x27; was important at the time but Palmeiras is still not recognized as an intercontinental champion by FIFA.

===The &quot;Academy&quot; becomes a Brazilian giant===
In the 1960s, the standard of quality of Palmeiras played – led by the one who would come to symbolize this period of football excellence, Ademir da Guia – led the Palestra Italia team to be called the &quot;Academy&quot; of Brazilian football.

The first Academy had Djalma Santos, Djalma Dias, Dudu, Ademir da Guia, Julinho Botelho, Vavá, Liminha and Chinesinho as some of the outstanding players.
Managed by Filpo Núñez, Palmeiras players won the most important national competition in 1965, the Rio – São Paulo championship, with stand-out performances. Blow-outs against top rivals included seven goals scored against Santos, five against Botafogo in their home stadium of the Maracanã, five against São Paulo, and another four scored against Vasco. The title came to Palmeiras in another lopsided victory against Botafogo at Pacaembú Stadium in São Paulo.

That same year, the Brazilian Sports Federation (CBD) used the entire Palmeiras roster to inaugurate the Mineirão Stadium and represent Brazil in an official national team match against Uruguay for the Inconfidência Cup. The day that it donned the green and white, Palmeiras as Brazil was victorious 3–0 over the Uruguayan blue.

In the previous year, Palmeiras had won the Rio de Janeiro Quadricentennial Cup (Torneio do IV Centenário do Rio de Janeiro de 1965) by beating the Paraguay national team 5–2 and besting Peñarol of Uruguay in the final.

By the end of the 1960s, Palmeiras won the Copa do Brasil and the Roberto Gomes Pedrosa tournament – the Brazilian Championship equivalent at the time.

These victories laid the groundwork for the second Palmeiras Academy, with players like Luís Pereira, Leivinha, Emerson Leão, Dudu, Ademir da Guia and César.

Led by Osvaldo Brandão, the team captured several titles in the 1970s. It was a three-time São Paulo state champion – emerging undefeated in one of those tournaments – a two-time Brazilian champion, a three-time winner of Spain&#x27;s Ramón de Carranza Trophy, and the winner of Argentina&#x27;s Mar del Plata Trophy – considered the South American Club Championship.

===1980s: The lost decade===

Already used to victories at the &quot;Academy&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s, Palmeiras fans saw the 1980s come and go without championships or titles. In 1986, Palmeiras fielded a good team – routing Corinthians 5–1 and playing a historic game in the semifinals of the São Paulo State Championship against that same rival, prevailing 3–0. Ten years after winning its last State title, Palmeiras finally arrived at the final of the state championship, but lost to Inter de Limeira.

On 29 October 1986, Palmeiras fans adopted the pig as their mascot. At a game against Santos, the rival fans were chanting &quot;pig&quot;; the Palmeiras crowd responded with &quot;Come On Pig!! Come On Pig!! Olé Olé Olé...&quot; and &quot;Go Piiiig...&quot; A few days later, Placar sports magazine popularized the new nickname when it published an issue with Jorginho Putinatti – the symbol of that generation – holding a pig in his lap.

There were two noteworthy events during this decade. In the 1983 State Championship against Santos, referee José de Assis Aragão scored a goal for Palmeiras in the 47th minute of the second half. Striker Jorginho kicked the ball inside the penalty area, the ball was on its way out, but hit Aragão – who was on the goal line about a meter from the goal and went into the Santos net. The game ended in a 2–2 tie – much to the chagrin of Santos.

The second unexpected event occurred on 11 November 1988, when striker Gaúcho saved two penalties against Flamengo in a game for the Brazilian Championship at Maracanã. Gaúcho was put in goal after keeper Zetti broke his leg in the final minutes of the match. The game ended in a tie, and advanced to the penalty shootout phase. During the shootout, Gaúcho stopped two shots, from Aldair and Zinho. To cap off the evening, he scored a penalty himself while wearing the goalkeeper&#x27;s jersey.

In 1989, Palmeiras had another chance to win a title. Undefeated until the penultimate match, the team was eliminated when it lost to Bragantino in the semifinals of the São Paulo State Championship. The 1980s ended without significant victories, but the 1990s would make up for that.

===The end of the 20th century – The Greatest in Brazil===

Palmeiras found itself in the midst of a sixteen-year drought, without any significant trophies, until 1992, when the club signed a sponsorship deal with Italian dairy giant Parmalat. The deal lasted for eight years and quickly turned Palmeiras into Brazil&#x27;s richest club.

In the 1990s, Palmeiras enjoyed countless achievements, winning numerous important titles. In the first full year of the relationship with Parmalat, the team won the Campeonato Paulista in 1993, beating its biggest rival Corinthians in the final, under the command of coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo and with a squad featuring Evair, Zinho, Edmundo, César Sampaio, Mazinho, Antônio Carlos, Roberto Carlos and Edílson .

That same year, Palmeiras also captured the Rio-São Paulo Championship, once again against Corinthians, and the 1993 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A. In 1994, it achieved the unprecedented feat of winning consecutive state championships and Brazilian championships, the latter victory coming against Corinthians once again.

In 1996 Palmeiras won the friendly Euro-America Cup, defeating the Bundesliga champions and future 1996-97 UEFA Champions League and 1997 Intercontinental Cup champions Borussia Dortmund by a score of 6–1. Later, the team handily won the 1996 Campeonato Paulista, scoring more than 100 goals and accumulating historic victories, such as a 6-0 thrashing of Santos FC. Rivaldo, Muller, Djalminha and Luizão were the standouts of this historic team.

Palmeiras also had a remarkable sequence of games in the 1996 Copa do Brasil, beating Clube Atletico Mineiro 5-0 (7-1 on aggregate) and defeating the 1995 Copa Libertadores winners Gremio in the semifinals, but the team eventually suffered a surprise loss to Cruzeiro EC, who would eventually win the 1997 Copa Libertadores.

In 1998, Palmeiras won the 1998 Copa do Brasil and the 1998 Copa Mercosur, both against Cruzeiro EC. The latter was the first official international cup won by Palmeiras since 1951.

===1999 – The first Copa Libertadores trophy===
Already famous for winning the 1991 Copa do Brasil, 1994 Copa do Brasil, 1995 Copa Libertadores, and 1996 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, Luiz Felipe Scolari was hired as manager in 1997 and led the team to a number of important trophies, including their first Copa Libertadores.

Palmeiras faced a challenging road to the finals, defeating the defending champions Vasco da Gama in the round of 16 by 5–3 on aggregate (including coming back to secure a historic 4–2 away victory), rival Corinthians in the quarterfinals on penalties, and 1996 Copa Libertadores winners River Plate in the semifinals by 3–1 on aggregate.

The final matches were against Deportivo Cali from Colombia, the 1978 Copa Libertadores runners up. In the first leg in Cali, Deportivo beat Palmeiras 1–0. In the second leg, at Estádio Palestra Itália, Palmeiras beat Deportivo 2–1 and won the competition in a penalty shootout.

Important players from that team were World Cup winners Marcos, Zinho and Roque Júnior, as well as Alex, Evair, Paulo Nunes, and César Sampaio.

That same year, Palmeiras disputed the 1999 Intercontinental Cup in Tokyo, but were defeated by Manchester United of England. Despite enjoying the better of the game, Palmeiras had a goal from Alex ruled out, and conceded a goal after an uncharacteristic mistake by Marcos, one of the team&#x27;s stars and future 2002 FIFA World Cup champion.
===2000 – Four finals disputed===
In 2000, Palmeiras disputed four finals. First, the team won the Rio-São Paulo Tournament after beating Vasco da Gama by 6–1 on aggregate in the final. In the first leg, in Rio de Janeiro, Palmeiras beat Vasco 2–1. In the second leg, at Morumbi Stadium, Palmeiras prevailed by a score of 4–0.

The club again reached the 2000 Copa Libertadores finals, this time against Boca Juniors from Argentina. In the first leg in Buenos Aires, the game ended 2–2. In the second leg, at the Morumbi in São Paulo, the game ended 0–0, with Boca winning the competition in a penalty shootout and preventing a consecutive championship for Palmeiras.

After the Copa Libertadores final, Luiz Felipe Scolari left Palmeiras, along with a number of players. Given the circumstances, Palmeiras invested in younger players and won the first ever Brazilian Champions&#x27; Cup after beating Sport Recife in the final. The result qualified the club to play in their 3rd consecutive Copa Libertadores in 2001.

At the end of the year, the club also reached the quarterfinals of the 2000 Campeonato Brasileiro playoffs and played their 3rd consecutive Copa Mercosur final, which was also their 5th consecutive CONMEBOL championship final since the second half of 1998 (1998 Copa Mercosur, 1999 Copa Libertadores, 1999 Copa Mercosur, 2000 Copa Libertadores, and the 2000 Copa Mercosur).

The young Palmeiras team eventually lost the 2000 Copa Mercosur final to a Vasco da Gama full of stars such as Romario, Juninho Paulista, and Euller. The team was called “&quot;bom e barato&quot;” (good and cheap) and their success triggered a new management philosophy in the club, which was eventually proven to not be as effective in subsequent years.

Having won key national and international competitions, Palmeiras was proclaimed Brazilian football&#x27;s &quot;Best Team of the 20th Century of Brazil&quot; by the São Paulo State Football Federation (FPF), the &quot;Folha de São Paulo&quot; and &quot;Estado de São Paulo&quot; newspapers, and the &quot;Placar&quot; magazine.

===2000s – Difficult years===

Parmalat&#x27;s sponsorship ended in 2000, leaving Palmeiras in dire straits. After reaching the 2001 Copa Libertadores semi-finals (where they lost to the Boca Juniors), the club had a bad 2002 season that ended in relegation to the Série B, but immediately returned in 2004.

The 2004 and 2005 seasons were rather successful, with the team finishing in 4th both years and qualifying for the Libertadores in 2005 and 2006. Palmeiras was eliminated by rivals São Paulo in the Round of 16 in both years.

In 2007, Edmundo played his last season for the club, just missing out on the top 4 in Série A in the final game of the season.

In 2008, Palmeiras arrived at a sponsorship agreement with Traffic, a sports marketing agency. The club made big investments on new players and Vanderlei Luxemburgo. This new strategy paid dividends as Palmeiras won their 22nd Paulista Championship, capped off with a 5–0 victory over Ponte Preta in the second leg of the final. Palmeiras finished 4th in the Campeonato Brasileiro, which qualified them for the 2009 edition of the Copa Libertadores.

===Allianz Parque===

The year of 2008 also marked the beginning of the planning phase for a new stadium for the club, as well as remodeling the social club, to prepare Palmeiras for the club&#x27;s centenary year in 2014. The planned arena is now known as Allianz Parque.

In 2009, the club reached the quarterfinals of Copa Libertadores, eventually losing to Uruguayan side Nacional on away goals.
In the same season, Palmeiras came close to winning the Brazilian League, but political problems inside the club caused internal turmoil and affected on-field performances, and Palmeiras finished the season in fifth place.

From 2010 to 2014, Palmeiras played its home matches in the municipal Pacaembu, as the Estádio Palestra Itália was demolished.

===2012: Copa do Brasil and relegation===

In 2012, Palmeiras won the Copa do Brasil for the second time, beating Coritiba in the final. Led by manager Luiz Felipe Scolari and captained by midfielder Marcos Assunção, Palmeiras did not suffer a defeat in the entire tournament.

Less than three months after winning the Copa do Brasil, Scolari would leave the club due to poor performances in the league. He was replaced by Gilson Kleina, the manager of Ponte Preta, but the team failed to improve its performances and was relegated to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série B for the second time in its history after a draw against Flamengo on November 18, 2012.

===2013–2015: Beginning of a resurgence===

In 2013, now under the administration of newly elected President Paulo Nobre, Palmeiras was easily promoted back to the first division with six games to spare, ensuring their participation in the 2014 Série A for the club&#x27;s centennial season.

Palmeiras suffered a setback early on in its 2014 centennial season as head coach Kleina was sacked, swiftly followed by the departure of striker Alan Kardec and defender Henrique. Argentinian Ricardo Gareca was signed to coach the team after the break for the World Cup in Brazil, but failed to meet expectations and was sacked after a short spell. Dorival Júnior replaced Gareca until the end of the season, as the club was fighting against relegation. With first-choice goalkeeper Fernando Prass and midfielder Jorge Valdivia both returning from injury, the players led Palmeiras throughout the second half of the season as the club managed to avoid relegation and finished the season in 16th place.

====Another Copa do Brasil====

In 2015, Palmeiras underwent an extensive rebuilding project, hiring a new coach and new football director. The club signed 25 players over the year and promoted several new talents from the club&#x27;s youth teams, while almost every player from the 2014 squad was moved on. Palmeiras also improved its official paid supporters program, &quot;Avanti&quot;, eventually reaching 114,000 paid supporters.

This was also Palmeiras&#x27; first season playing in their newly built stadium, the Allianz Parque, which seated 43,713 fans and included fully covered spectator seating; it was inaugurated on 19 November 2014.

Palmeiras reached the 2015 Campeonato Paulista finals, which they lost on penalties to rivals Santos FC.

On 9 June 2015, manager Oswaldo de Oliveira was sacked by Palmeiras due to a slow start to the Campeonato Brasileiro. On 10 June 2015, Palmeiras reached an agreement with Marcelo Oliveira, recently sacked by Cruzeiro despite having won the Brazilian league with them in 2013 and 2014.

Palmeiras won the 2015 Copa do Brasil on 2 December 2015. After a 1–0 loss to Santos in the first leg, the players were received at the stadium by more than 40,000 supporters both inside and outside Allianz Parque. Palmeiras won the second leg 2–1, with both goals scored by Dudu, before winning the trophy on penalties (with Fernando Prass saving a penalty and converting the winning penalty). Gabriel Jesus was the great revelation of that team, while the experience of midfielder Zé Roberto was also fundamental for Palmeiras to win the competition.

With this title, Palmeiras increased its supremacy as Brazil&#x27;s greatest champion, with 12 national titles (8 league titles, 1 Brazilian Champions Cup and 3 Copa do Brasil titles). As champions of the 2015 Copa do Brasil, Palmeiras also secured a place in the 2016 Copa Libertadores group stage.

===2016–2018: Back on top of Brazilian football===

On 12 March 2016, Palmeiras reached a verbal agreement with Cuca to become its new manager. Palmeiras re-signed Zé Roberto, while also signing other key players for the 2016 season, including Dudu, Edu Dracena, Moisés, Róger Guedes, Jean, Yerry Mina, and Tchê Tchê.

====2016: 9th national title====

After a dominant year, leading the league for 29 weeks, Cuca led Palmeiras to their ninth league title, and first in 22 years, making it the club with the most league titles in Brazil. Gabriel Jesus was the team&#x27;s leading scorer with 12 goals. On 27 November 2016, Palmeiras was guaranteed the title before the 38th week, beating Chapecoense at home 1–0 with a goal from Fabiano in the 26th minute. With an attendance of 40,986 supporters, this broke the old record attendance of 40,035 from 12 July 2016 against Santos.

====2018: 10th national title====

On 25 November 2018, Palmeiras clinched its 10th Campeonato Brasileiro title after defeating Vasco 1–0 in Rio de Janeiro. On 2 December 2018, Palmeiras played their last game of the season in front of a record-breaking crowd of 41,216. With a 3–2 win over Vitória, Palmeiras set a new Campeonato Brasileiro record for the longest undefeated streak (23 matches).

===2020: Treble===

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Palmeiras beat archrival Corinthians in a historic final of the Campeonato Paulista. In the first final in the history of the competition without any spectators, Palmeiras won after beating Corinthians in a penalty shootout.

On 30 January 2021, Palmeiras, led by Portuguese coach Abel Ferreira, won the 2020 Copa Libertadores against Santos by a score of 1–0 at the Maracanã, in Rio de Janeiro. It was Palmeiras&#x27; second title in the competition. Breno Lopes scored the only goal of the match nine minutes into second-half stoppage time.

As champions, Palmeiras qualified for the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar and earned the right to play against the winners of the 2020 Copa Sudamericana in the 2021 Recopa Sudamericana.

In March 2021, Palmeiras won the 2020 Copa do Brasil, defeating Grêmio with an overall score of 3–0. It was the 4th Copa do Brasil title for Palmeiras.
===2021: Defending the Libertadores===

On 27 November 2021, Palmeiras won the 2021 Copa Libertadores against Flamengo, with a score of 2–1, in a single match in a decisive confrontation held at Estadio Centenario, in Montevideo, Uruguay. Once again led by the Portuguese coach Abel Ferreira, Palmeiras managed to win the second consecutive title in less than a year – the first time they ever achieved such feat in their history.

Raphael Veiga and Deyverson scored for the &quot;Verdão&quot; five minutes into the first half and into extra time respectively. Gabriel Barbosa scored the only goal for Flamengo at 72 minutes.

As champions, Palmeiras qualified for the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and earned the right to play against the winners of the 2021 Copa Sudamericana in the 2022 Recopa Sudamericana.

On 20 January 2022 the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics announced Palmeiras as the winner of the Men&#x27;s World Best Club Ranking of 2021. It was the first time a Brazilian club finished a year on top of this ranking.

===2022: Setting new records===

In January 2022, Palmeiras&#x27; under-20s won the Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior for the first time, defeating rival Santos FC 4–0 in the final. This victory brought home the only major youth trophy that had yet to be won by Palmeiras, and served as the culmination of a sustained period of investment in the youth teams, beginning in 2013.

In February 2022, Palmeiras played the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup and finished in the second place after beating Al-Ahly in the semifinals, and losing the final match 2–1 in extra time against Chelsea after a penalty confirmed by the video assistance referee.

In March 2022, Palmeiras defeated Athletico Paranaense by 4–2 on aggregate and won the 2022 Recopa Sudamericana.

In November 2022, Palmeiras won their 11th Campeonato Brasileiro after a solid season, having lost only three games. The trophy was the remaining possible trophy to be won by Abel Ferreira in South America.

===2023: Another victorious season===
In January 2023, Palmeiras won the Copa São Paulo de Futebol Júnior for the second time in a row, defeating América Mineiro 2-1 in the final. The &quot;Verdão&quot; then added the 2023 Supercopa do Brasil to their trophy cabinet on 28 January 2023 after scoring 4-3 against Clube de Regatas Flamengo. The match was played at Mane Garrincha Stadium in Brasília.

As they did the season before they reached the Campeonato Paulista finals without a single loss, however, Palmeiras lost the first leg of the final by a 2-1 scoreline against Esporte Clube Água Santa, but proceeded to win the second leg 4-0 as they had done the year before to win their 25th, and second consecutive Campeonato Paulista title.

In the Copa Libertadores, Palmeiras entered directly into the group stage and was drawn into Group C alongside Barcelona from Guayaquil, Ecuador, Bolívar from Bolivia, and Cerro Porteño from Paraguay, having the best campaign in the group stage. In the round of 16, eliminated Atlético-MG after winning the first leg away at Mineirão 1-0 and drawing 0-0 at home at Allianz Parque. In the quarterfinals, they faced Deportivo Pereira from Colombia. Palmeiras won the first leg at Estádio Hernán Ramírez Villegas with a 4-0 victory and drew 0-0 in the second leg at home.

==Stadium==

===Estádio Palestra Itália (1917–2010)===
The Estádio Palestra Itália was home of Palmeiras from 1917 to 2010. The venue was also known as &quot;Parque Antártica&quot; because the area was a park built by the Antarctica Paulista Brewing Company in the beginning of the last century, before being acquired by Palmeiras in 1920. In the past its capacity was listed as 35,000 spectators. However, even though its grandstands were extended in the late 1990s, it held only seats 27,640 people due to regulations which enforce safety and comfort.

It was one of the most important Brazilian grounds, considering the amount of decisive and important matches played there. Examples of matches played in Palestra Itália include 1999 Copa Libertadores final, the Copa Mercosur finals of 1998, 1999 and 2000, 1996 Copa do Brasil final and several Campeonato Paulista finals.

The last official match played in the stadium was against Grêmio for the Série A on 22 May 2010, and the last match played was a friendly against Boca Juniors on 9 July 2010.

===Allianz Parque (2014–present)===


Opened in November 2014, the Allianz Parque has 43,713 covered seats, being 25,395 lower seats, 14,888 upper seats and 3,430 in the cabins. The stadium was built for multipurpose events. Many other facilities are in place, including an enhanced parking area, a VIP area, a media center for up to 1,000 media members, 3 restaurants and bars and a heliport. The first official game at Allianz Parque was held on 19 November 2014, between Palmeiras and Sport in the Brazilian Série A, when hosts Palmeiras lost to Sport Recife 0–2. The first official goal of the stadium was scored by Ananias.

On 14 June 2015, Palmeiras won their first Brasileirão match in Allianz Parque with a 2–1 win over Fluminense.

==Kit==

Palmeiras&#x27; first kit consisted of green jerseys, white shorts and green socks. Palmeiras&#x27; first jersey was blue jersey tribute to Italian National team. After that, a green with a horizontal white band, and a white with a red Savoy cross as the crest. Palmeiras have played in blue shirts many times as a tribute to the Italian National Team. Their supporters are also well known for creating the &quot;mancha verde&quot; (green stain) of fog and smoke when Palmeiras is entering the pitch.
From 2007 to 2009 Palmeiras used a third jersey: a light yellow shirt with a dark green shorts and socks, one of the most successful and best sellers from Adidas.

In 2010 Palmeiras the light yellow jersey became the second jersey, and started using a blue and white shirt, with white shorts, for their third jersey.

In 2016, Palmeiras announced the extension of the sponsorship agreement with Crefisa and FAM (Faculdade das Américas), which have exclusivity in the uniform of Palmeiras. The two companies, which are part of the same group controlled by the couple José Roberto Lamacchia and Leila Pereira, paid Palmeiras around R$78 million ($20 million) a year, the highest amount ever deposited by a partner in the history of Palmeiras. Palmeiras&#x27; uniform is among the most valuable uniforms in South America since 2016.

===Manufacturer and sponsors===
Crefisa, a Brazilian bank, announced it would sponsor Palmeiras for the 2015 season. After their success in the 2016 Campeonato Brasileiro, Crefisa announced it would increase fundings to R$90 million.

== Supporters ==
Originally, Palmeiras was a club heavily supported by Brazilians of Italian descent in São Paulo State. Over time, that distinction has reduced, and today the fan base is very diverse.

Palmeiras&#x27; largest supporters group are the Mancha Alvi-Verde (&quot;White and Green Stain&quot;, a green version of Phantom Blot), TUP (the oldest group), Acadêmicos da Savóia (the newest group), among others. There are big concentrations of Palmeiras fans across Brazil and in some places across the world known as “consulados” (consulates).

According to the famous Brazilian journalist and Palmeiras fan Joelmir Beting, who was a huge fan of the club, “it is unnecessary to explain the emotion of supporting Palmeiras to its fans, and impossible to do it to the non-fans”. This became one of the club&#x27;s mottos and reflected in the walls of Allianz Parque&#x27;s home dressing room.

== Rivalries ==
=== Corinthians ===
Palmeiras&#x27; biggest rival is Corinthians. The rivalry between the two clubs is considered Brazil&#x27;s greatest, and the most intense in country, entering the conversation of being one of the biggest rivalries in the world, and considerably one of the oldest as well. Their matches are known as the Paulista Derby.

The most important matches between the two clubs were the 1999 Copa Libertadores 1999 quarterfinals and 2000 Copa Libertadores semifinals, both won by Palmeiras on penalties.

In O Casamento de Romeu e Julieta, the rivalry between Palmeiras and Corinthians played a major role in the plot.

=== Santos ===
Santos FC is another major rival; the games between the two clubs are called the Clássico da Saudade (&quot;The Good Times Classic&quot;). Located in the city of the same name, only 76 km (47,5 mi) from São Paulo, Santos is also one of the 4 big clubs of the state.
