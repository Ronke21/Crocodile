<text>An oil well is a drillhole boring in Earth that is designed to bring petroleum oil hydrocarbons to the surface. Usually some natural gas is released as associated petroleum gas along with the oil. A well that is designed to produce only gas may be termed a gas well. Wells are created by drilling down into an oil or gas reserve and if necessary equipped with extraction devices such as pumpjacks. Creating the wells can be an expensive process, costing at least hundreds of thousands of dollars, and costing much more when in difficult-to-access locations, e.g., offshore. The process of modern drilling for wells first started in the 19th century but was made more efficient with advances to oil drilling rigs and technology during the 20th century.

Wells are frequently sold or exchanged between different oil and gas companies as an asset – in large part because during falls in the price of oil and gas, a well may be unproductive, but if prices rise, even low-production wells may be economically valuable. Moreover, new methods, such as hydraulic fracturing (a process of injecting gas or liquid to force more oil or natural gas production) have made some wells viable. However, peak oil and climate policy surrounding fossil fuels have made fewer of these wells and costly techniques viable.

However, a large number of neglected or poorly maintained wellheads is a large environmental issue: they may leak methane or other toxic substances into local air, water and soil systems. This pollution often becomes worse when wells are abandoned or orphaned – i.e., where wells no longer economically viable are no longer maintained by their (former) owners. A 2020 estimate by Reuters suggested that there were at least 29 million abandoned wells internationally, creating a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions worsening climate change.

==History==


The earliest known oil wells were drilled in China in 347 CE. These wells had depths of up to about and were drilled using bits attached to bamboo poles. The oil was burned to evaporate brine producing salt. By the 10th century, extensive bamboo pipelines connected oil wells with salt springs. The ancient records of China and Japan are said to contain many allusions to the use of natural gas for lighting and heating. Petroleum was known as &quot;burning water&quot; in Japan in the 7th century.

According to Kasem Ajram, petroleum was distilled by the Persian alchemist Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) in the 9th century, producing chemicals such as kerosene in the alembic (&quot;al-ambiq&quot;), and which was mainly used for kerosene lamps. Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil in order to produce flammable products for military purposes. Through Islamic Spain, distillation became available in Western Europe by the 12th century.

Some sources claim that from the 9th century, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan, to produce naphtha for the petroleum industry. These places were described by Marco Polo in the 13th century, who described the output of those oil wells as hundreds of shiploads. When Marco Polo in 1264 visited Baku, on the shores of the Caspian Sea, he saw oil being collected from seeps. He wrote that &quot;on the confines toward Geirgine there is a fountain from which oil springs in great abundance, in as much as a hundred shiploads might be taken from it at one time.&quot;

In 1846, Baku (settlement Bibi-Heybat) the first ever well was drilled with percussion tools to a depth of for oil exploration. In 1846–1848, the first modern oil wells were drilled on the Absheron Peninsula north-east of Baku, by Russian engineer Vasily Semyonov applying the ideas of Nikolay Voskoboynikov.

Ignacy Łukasiewicz, a Polish pharmacist and petroleum industry pioneer drilled one of the world&#x27;s first modern oil wells in 1854 in Polish village Bóbrka, Krosno County who in 1856 built one of the world&#x27;s first oil refineries.

In North America, the first commercial oil well entered operation in Oil Springs, Ontario in 1858, while the first offshore oil well was drilled in 1896 in the Summerland Oil Field on the California Coast.

The earliest oil wells in modern times were drilled percussively, by repeatedly raising and dropping a bit on the bottom of a cable into the borehole. In the 20th century, cable tools were largely replaced with rotary drilling, which could drill boreholes to much greater depths and in less time. The record-depth Kola Borehole used a mud motor while drilling to achieve a depth of over .

Until the 1970s, most oil wells were essentially vertical, although lithological variations cause most wells to deviate at least slightly from true vertical (see deviation survey). However, modern directional drilling technologies allow for highly deviated wells that can, given sufficient depth and with the proper tools, actually become horizontal. This is of great value as the reservoir rocks that contain hydrocarbons are usually horizontal or nearly horizontal; a horizontal wellbore placed in a production zone has more surface area in the production zone than a vertical well, resulting in a higher production rate. The use of deviated and horizontal drilling has also made it possible to reach reservoirs several kilometers or miles away from the drilling location (extended reach drilling), allowing for the production of hydrocarbons located below locations that are difficult to place a drilling rig on, environmentally sensitive, or populated.

==Life of a well==
=== Planning ===

* For a production well, the target is picked to optimize production from the well and manage reservoir drainage. 
* For an exploration or appraisal well, the target is chosen to confirm the existence of a viable hydrocarbon reservoir or to learn its extent.
* For an injection well, the target is selected to locate the point of injection in a permeable zone that may support disposing of water or gas and/or pushing hydrocarbons into nearby production wells.
The target (the endpoint of the well) will be matched with a surface location (the starting point of the well), and a trajectory between the two will be designed. There are many considerations to take into account when designing the trajectory such as the clearance from any nearby wells (anti-collision) or future wellpaths.

Before a well is drilled, a geologic target is identified by a geologist or geophysicist to meet the objectives of the well. 
When the well path is identified, a team of geoscientists and engineers will develop a set of presumed characteristics of the subsurface path that will be drilled through to reach the target. These properties may include lithology pore pressure, fracture gradient, wellbore stability, porosity and permeability. These assumptions are used by a well engineering team designing the casing and completion programs for the well. Also considered in the detailed planning are selection of the drill bits, Bottom hole assembly, and the drilling fluid Step-by-step procedures are written to provide guidelines for executing the well in a safe and cost-efficient manner.

With the interplay with many of the elements in a well&#x27;s design, trajectories and designs often go through several iterations before the plan is finalized.

===Drilling===
The well is created by drilling a hole 12 cm to 1 meter (5 in to 40 in) in diameter into the earth with a drilling rig that rotates a drill string with a bit attached. At depths during the process, sections of steel pipe (casing), slightly smaller in diameter than the borehole at that point, are placed in the hole. Cement slurry will be pumped down the inside to rise in the annulus between the borehole and the outside of the casing. The casing provides structural integrity to that portion of the newly drilled wellbore, in addition to isolating potentially dangerous high pressure zones from lower-pressure ones, and from the surface.

With these zones safely isolated and the formation protected by the casing, the well can be drilled deeper (into potentially higher-pressure or more-unstable formations) with a smaller bit, and then cased with a smaller size pipe. Modern wells generally have two to as many as five sets of subsequently smaller hole sizes, each cemented with casing.

;To drill the well
* The rotating drill bit, aided by the weight of the drill string above it, cuts into the rock. There are different types of drill bits; some cause the rock to disintegrate by compressive failure, while others shear slices off the rock as the bit turns.
* Drilling fluid, a.k.a. &quot;mud&quot;, is pumped down the inside of the drill pipe and exits at the drill bit. The principal components of drilling fluid are usually water and clay, but it also typically contains a complex mixture of fluids, solids and chemicals that must be carefully tailored to provide the correct physical and chemical characteristics required to safely drill the well. Particular functions of the drilling mud include cooling the bit, lifting rock cuttings to the surface, preventing destabilisation (spalling) of the rock in the wellbore, and overcoming the pressure of fluids inside the rock so that these fluids do not enter the wellbore. Some oil wells are drilled with air or foam as the drilling fluid.
* The generated rock &quot;cuttings&quot; are swept up by the drilling fluid as it circulates back to the surface inside the casing and outside of the drill pipe. The fluid then goes through &quot;shakers&quot; that screen the cuttings out of the fluid, which is returned to the pit for reuse. Watching for abnormalities in the returning cuttings and monitoring pit volume or rate of returning fluid are imperative to catch &quot;kicks&quot; early. A &quot;kick&quot; is when the formation pressure at the depth of the bit is greater than the hydrostatic head of the mud above, which if not controlled temporarily by closing the blowout preventers followed by increasing the density of the drilling fluid would allow formation fluids to enter the annulus uncontrollably.
* The drill string to which the bit is attached is gradually lengthened as the well gets deeper by screwing in additional 9 m (30 ft) sections or &quot;joints&quot; of pipe under the kelly or top drive at the surface. This process is called &quot;making a connection&quot;. The operation called &quot;tripping&quot; is when pulling the bit out of the hole to replace the bit (tripping out), and running back in with a new bit (tripping in). Joints are usually combined for more efficient tripping by creating stands of multiple joints. A conventional triple, for example, has three joints at a time racked vertically in the derrick. Some modern rigs, called &quot;super singles&quot;, trip pipe one at a time, laying it out on racks as they go.

This process is all facilitated by a drilling rig, which contains all necessary equipment to circulate the drilling fluid, hoist and rotate the pipe, remove cuttings from the drilling fluid, and generate on-site power for these operations.

===Completion===

After drilling and casing the well, it must be &#x27;completed&#x27;. Completion is the process in which the well is prepared to produce oil or gas.

In a cased-hole completion, small perforations are made in the portion of the casing across the production zone, to provide a path for the oil to flow from the surrounding rock into the production tubing. In open hole completion, often a &#x27;sand screen&#x27; or &#x27;gravel pack&#x27; is installed in the last-drilled but uncased reservoir section. These maintain structural integrity of the wellbore in the absence of casing, while still allowing flow from the reservoir into the borehole. Screens also control the migration of formation sands into production tubulars, which can lead to washouts and other problems, particularly from unconsolidated sand formations.

After a flow path is made, acids and fracturing fluids may be pumped into the well to fracture, clean, or otherwise prepare and stimulate the reservoir rock to allow optimal production of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Usually the area above the producing section of the well is packed off inside the casing, and connected to the surface via a smaller diameter pipe called tubing. This arrangement provides a redundant barrier to leaks of hydrocarbons as well as allowing damaged sections to be replaced. Also, the smaller cross-sectional area of the tubing gives reservoir fluids an increased velocity to minimize liquid fallback that would create additional back pressure, and shields the casing from corrosive well fluids.

In many wells, the natural pressure of the subsurface reservoir is high enough for the oil or gas to flow to the surface. However, this is not always the case, especially in depleted fields where the pressures have been lowered by other producing wells, or in low-permeability oil reservoirs. Installing a smaller diameter tubing may be enough to help the production, but artificial lift methods may also be needed. Common solutions include surface pump jacks, downhole hydraulic pumps or gas lift assistance. Many new systems in recent years have been introduced for well completion. Multiple packer systems with frac ports or port collars in an all-in-one system have cut completion costs and improved production, especially in the case of horizontal wells. These new systems allow casing to run into the lateral zone equipped with proper packer/frac-port placement for optimal hydrocarbon recovery.

===Production===
The production stage is the most important stage of a well&#x27;s life: when the oil and gas are produced. By this time, the oil rigs and workover rigs used to drill and complete the well will have moved off the wellbore, and the top is usually outfitted with a collection of valves called a Christmas tree or production tree. These valves regulate pressures, control flows, and allow access to the wellbore in case further completion work is needed. From the outlet valve of the production tree, the flow can be connected to a distribution network of pipelines and tanks to supply the product to refineries, natural gas compressor stations, or oil export terminals.

As long as the pressure in the reservoir remains high enough, the production tree is all that is required to produce the well. If the pressure depletes and it is considered economically viable, an artificial lift method mentioned in the completions section can be employed.

Workovers are often necessary in older wells, which may need smaller diameter tubing, scale or paraffin removal, acid matrix jobs, or completion in new zones of interest in a shallower reservoir. Such remedial work can be performed using workover rigs – also known as &quot;pulling units&quot;, &quot;completion rigs&quot; or &quot;service rigs&quot; – to pull and replace tubing, or by the use of well intervention techniques utilizing coiled tubing. Depending on the type of lift system and wellhead a rod rig or flushby can be used to change a pump without pulling the tubing.

Enhanced recovery methods such as water flooding, steam flooding, or CO2 flooding may be used to increase reservoir pressure and provide a &quot;sweep&quot; effect to push hydrocarbons out of the reservoir. Such methods require the use of injection wells (often chosen from old production wells in a carefully determined pattern), and are used when facing problems with reservoir pressure depletion or high oil viscosity, sometimes being employed early in a field&#x27;s life. In certain cases – depending on the reservoir&#x27;s geomechanics – reservoir engineers may determine that ultimate recoverable oil may be increased by applying a waterflooding strategy early in the field&#x27;s development rather than later. Such enhanced recovery techniques are often called Secondary or &quot;tertiary recovery&quot;.

==Types of wells==
===By produced fluid===
* Wells that produce crude oil
* Wells that produce crude oil &quot;and&quot; natural gas, or
* Wells that &quot;only&quot; produce natural gas.
Natural gas, in a raw form known as associated petroleum gas, is almost always a by-product of producing oil. The short, light-gas carbon chains come out of solution when undergoing pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a bottle of soda where the carbon dioxide effervesces. If it escapes into the atmosphere intentionally it is known as vented gas, or if unintentionally as fugitive gas.

Unwanted natural gas can be a disposal problem at wells that are developed to produce oil. If there are no pipelines for natural gas near the wellhead it may be of no value to the oil well owner since it cannot reach the consumer markets. Such unwanted gas may then be burned off at the well site in a practice known as production flaring, but due to the energy resource waste and environmental damage concerns this practice is becoming less common.

Often, unwanted (or &#x27;stranded&#x27; gas without a market) gas is returned back into the reservoir with an &#x27;injection&#x27; well for storage or for re-pressurizing the producing formation. Another solution is to convert the natural gas to a liquid fuel. Gas to liquid (GTL) is a developing technology that converts stranded natural gas into synthetic gasoline, diesel or jet fuel through the Fischer–Tropsch process developed in World War II Germany. Like oil, such dense liquid fuels can be transported using conventional tankers for trucking to refineries or users. Proponents claim GTL fuels burn cleaner than comparable petroleum fuels. Most major international oil companies are in advanced development stages of GTL production, e.g. the Pearl GTL plant in Qatar, scheduled to come online in 2011. In locations such as the United States with a high natural gas demand, pipelines are usually favored to take the gas from the well site to the end consumer.

===By location===

Wells can be located:
* Onshore, or
* Offshore
Offshore wells can further be subdivided into
* Wells with subsea wellheads, where the top of the well is sitting on the ocean floor under water, and often connected to a pipeline on the ocean floor.
* Wells with &#x27;dry&#x27; wellheads, where the top of the well is above the water on a platform or jacket, which also often contains processing equipment for the produced fluid.

While the location of the well will be a large factor in the type of equipment used to drill it, there is actually little downhole difference in the well itself. An offshore well targets a reservoir that happens to be underneath an ocean. Due to logistics and specialized equipment needed, drilling an offshore well is far more costly than a comparable onshore well. These wells dot the Southern and Central Great Plains, Southwestern United States, and are the most common wells in the Middle East.

===By purpose===

Another way to classify oil wells is by their purpose in contributing to the development of a resource. They can be characterized as:
* &quot;wildcat wells&quot; that are drilled where little or no known geological information is available. The site may have been selected because of wells drilled some distance from the proposed location but to an underground structure that appeared similar to the proposed site. Individuals who drill wildcat wells are known as &#x27;wildcatters&#x27;.
* &quot;exploration wells&quot; are drilled purely for exploratory (information gathering) purposes in a new area. The site selection is usually based on seismic data, satellite surveys, etc. Details gathered in this well include the presence of hydrocarbon in the drilled location, the amount of fluid present and the depth at which oil or gas occurs.
* &quot;appraisal wells&quot; may be needed to assess characteristics (such as flow rate, reservoir quantity) of a proven hydrocarbon accumulation. Such wells reduce uncertainty about the characteristics and properties of the hydrocarbon present in the field.
* &quot;production wells&quot; are drilled primarily for producing oil or gas, once the producing structure and characteristics are determined.
* &quot;development wells&quot; are wells drilled for the production of oil or gas already proven by appraisal drilling to be suitable for exploitation.
* &quot;abandoned wells&quot; are wells permanently plugged in the drilling phase for technical reasons, or that had failed to locate commercially valuable hydrocarbons.

At a producing well site, active wells may be further categorized as:
* &quot;oil producers&quot; producing predominantly liquid hydrocarbons, but most include some associated gas.
* &quot;gas producers&quot; producing almost entirely gaseous hydrocarbons, consisting mostly of natural gas.
* &quot;water injectors&quot; injecting water into the formation to maintain reservoir pressure, or simply to dispose of water produced with the hydrocarbons because even after treatment, it would be too oily and too saline to be considered clean for dumping overboard offshore, let alone into a fresh water resource in the case of onshore wells. Water injection into the producing zone frequently has a beneficial element of reservoir management; however, often produced water disposal is into shallower zones safely beneath any fresh water zones.
* &quot;aquifer producers&quot; intentionally producing water for re-injection to manage pressure. If possible this water will come from the reservoir itself. Using aquifer produced water rather than water from other sources is to preclude chemical incompatibility that might lead to reservoir-plugging precipitates. These wells will generally be needed only if produced water from the oil or gas producers is insufficient for reservoir management purposes.
* &quot;gas injectors&quot; injecting gas into the reservoir often as a means of disposal or sequestering for later production, but also to maintain reservoir pressure.

Lahee classification 
* &quot;New Field Wildcat&quot; (NFW) – far from other producing fields and on a structure that has not previously produced.
* &quot;New Pool Wildcat&quot; (NPW) – new pools on already producing structure.
* &quot;Deeper Pool Test&quot; (DPT) – on already producing structure and pool, but on a deeper pay zone.
* &quot;Shallower Pool Test&quot; (SPT) – on already producing structure and pool, but on a shallower pay zone.
* &quot;Outpost&quot; (OUT) – usually two or more locations from nearest productive area.
* &quot;Development Well&quot; (DEV) – can be on the extension of a pay zone, or between existing wells (&quot;Infill&quot;).

==Cost==

The cost to drill a well depends mainly on the daily rate of the drilling rig, the extra services required to drill the well, the duration of the well program (including downtime and weather time), and the remoteness of the location (logistic supply costs).

The daily rates of offshore drilling rigs vary by their depth capability, and the market availability. Rig rates reported by industry web service show that the deepwater water floating drilling rigs are over twice the daily cost of the shallow water fleet, and rates for jack-up fleet can vary by factor of 3 depending upon capability.

With deepwater drilling rig rates in 2015 of around $520,000/day, and similar additional spread costs, a deepwater well of a duration of 100 days can cost around US$100 million.

With high-performance jackup rig rates in 2015 of around $177,000, and similar service costs, a high pressure, high-temperature well of duration 100 days can cost about US$30 million.

Onshore wells can be considerably cheaper, particularly if the field is at a shallow depth, where costs range from less than $4.9 million to $8.3 million, and the average completion costing $2.9 million to $5.6 million per well. Completion makes up a larger portion of onshore well costs than offshore wells, which generally have the added cost burden of a surface platform.

The total costs mentioned do not include the those associated with the risk of explosion and leakage of oil. Those costs include the cost of protecting against such disasters, the cost of the cleanup effort, and the hard-to-calculate cost of damage to the company&#x27;s image.

==Impacts on wildlife==

The impacts of oil exploration and drilling are often irreversible, particularly for wildlife. Research indicates that caribou in Alaska show a marked avoidance of areas near oil wells and seismic lines due to disturbances. Drilling often destroys wildlife habitat, causing wildlife stress, and breaks up large areas into smaller isolated ones, changing the environment, and forcing animals to migrate elsewhere. It can also bring in new species that compete with or prey on existing animals. Even though the actual area taken up by oil and gas equipment might be small, negative effects can spread. Animals like mule deer and elk try to stay away from the noise and activity of drilling sites, sometimes moving miles away to find peace. This movement and avoidance can lead to less space for these animals affecting their numbers and health.

The Sage-grouse is another example of an animal that tries to avoid areas with drilling, which can lead to fewer of them surviving and reproducing. Different studies show that drilling in their habitats negatively impacts sage-grouse populations. In Wyoming, sage grouse studied between 1984 and 2008 show a roughly 2.5 percent annual population decline in males, correlating with the density of oil and gas wells. Factors such as sagebrush cover and precipitation seemed to have little effect on count changes. These results align with other studies highlighting the detrimental impact of oil and gas development on sage-grouse populations.

<text>Georg Wilhelm Steller (10 March 1709 – 14 November 1746) was a German-born naturalist and explorer who contributed to the fields of biology, zoology, and ethnography. He participated in the Great Northern Expedition (1733–1743) and his observations of the natural world helped the exploration and documentation of the flora and fauna of the North Pacific region.

Steller pursued studies in theology and medicine before turning his attention to the natural sciences. In 1734, he joined the Russian Academy of Sciences as a physician, eventually being selected to accompany Bering&#x27;s expedition to the uncharted waters between Siberia and North America. Steller kept detailed records of species and cultures encountered, as well as ocean currents during the journey.

Steller discovered many new species, as he documented numerous plants and animals, many of which were previously unknown to Western science. Notable among his discoveries was the Steller&#x27;s sea cow and Steller&#x27;s sea eagle. His exploration of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Commander Islands significantly expanded scientific knowledge about the region&#x27;s biodiversity.

==Biography==
Early Life

Steller was born in Windsheim, near Nuremberg in Germany, the son of a Lutheran cantor, Johann Jakob Stöhler (after 1715, Georg changed his last name to be Steller to accommodate with Russian pronunciation), and studied at the University of Wittenberg. He then traveled to Russia as a physician on a troop ship returning home with the wounded. He arrived in Russia in November 1734. He met the naturalist Daniel Gottlieb Messerschmidt (1685–1735) at the Imperial Academy of Sciences. Two years after Messerschmidt&#x27;s death, Steller married his widow and acquired notes from his travels in Siberia not handed over to the Academy.

Expeditions

Steller knew about Vitus Bering&#x27;s Second Kamchatka Expedition, which had left Saint Petersburg in February 1733. He volunteered to join it and was accepted. He then left St Petersburg in January 1738 with his wife, who decided to stay in Moscow and go no farther. Steller met Johann Georg Gmelin in Yeniseisk in January 1739. Gmelin recommended that Steller take his place in the planned exploration of Kamchatka. Steller embraced that role and finally reached Okhotsk and the main expedition in March 1740 as Bering&#x27;s ships, the &quot;St. Peter&quot; and &quot;St. Paul&quot;, were nearing completion.
In September 1740, the expedition sailed to the Kamchatka Peninsula with Bering and his two expeditionary vessels sailing around the peninsula&#x27;s south tip and up to Avacha Bay on the Pacific coast. Steller went ashore on the east coast of Kamchatka to spend the winter in Bolsherechye, where he helped to organize a local school and began exploring Kamchatka. When Bering summoned him to join the voyage in search of America and the strait between the two continents, serving in the role of scientist and physician, Steller crossed the peninsula by dog sled. After Bering&#x27;s &quot;St. Peter&quot; was separated from its sister ship the &quot;St. Paul&quot; in a storm, Bering continued to sail east, expecting to find land soon. Steller, reading sea currents and flotsam and wildlife, insisted they should sail northeast. After considerable time lost, they turned northeast and made landfall in Alaska at Kayak Island on Monday 20 July 1741. Bering wanted to stay only long enough to take on fresh water. Steller argued Captain Bering into giving him more time for land exploration and was granted 10 hours. During his ten hours on land Steller noted the mathematical ratio of 10 years preparation for ten hours of investigation.

While the crew never even set foot on the mainland, Georg Steller is credited with being one of the first non-natives to have set foot upon Alaskan soil. The expedition never made mainland landfall because of a stubbornness and a &quot;dull fear&quot;. They left with only a sketch of what they think the mainland would look like. On a remarkable journey, Steller became the first European naturalist to describe a number of North American plants and animals, including a jay later named Steller&#x27;s jay.

Although Steller tried to treat the crew&#x27;s growing scurvy epidemic with leaves and berries he had gathered, officers scorned his proposal. Steller and his assistant were some of the very few who did not suffer from the ailment. On the return journey, with only 12 members of the crew able to move and the rigging rapidly failing, the expedition was shipwrecked on what later became known as Bering Island. Almost half of the crew had perished from scurvy during the voyage. Steller nursed the survivors, including Bering, but he could not be saved and died. The remaining men made camp with little food or water, a situation made only worse by frequent raids by Arctic foxes. The crew hunted sea otters, sea lions, fur seals and sea cows to survive the winter.

In early 1742, the crew used salvaged material from the St. Peter to construct a new vessel to return to Avacha Bay and nicknamed it &quot;The Bering&quot;. Steller spent the next two years exploring the Kamchatka peninsula. He was falsely accused of freeing Kamchadal rebels from prison by a jealous rival and recalled to St. Petersburg. At one point he was put under arrest and made to return to Irkutsk for a hearing. He was freed and again turned west toward St. Petersburg, but along the way he came down with a fever and died at Tyumen.

Some of his journals, which reached the academy and were later published by Peter Simon Pallas, were used by other explorers of the North Pacific, including Captain Cook. There is also a journal of Steller&#x27;s published by Stanford University Press that is titled &quot;Journal of a Voyage with Bering, 1741-1742,&quot; which has detailed accounts of the Second Kamchatka Expedition or the Great Northern Expedition.

Scientific Contributions

Of the six species of birds and mammals that Steller discovered during the voyage, two are extinct (Steller&#x27;s sea cow and the spectacled cormorant) and three are near threatened and vulnerable (Steller sea lion, Steller&#x27;s eider and Steller&#x27;s sea eagle). The sea cow, in particular, a massive northern relative of the dugong, lasted only 27 years after Steller discovered and named it. The sea cow had a limited population that quickly became victim of overhunting by the Russian crews that followed in Bering&#x27;s wake.

Steller&#x27;s jay is one of the few species named after Steller that is not currently listed as endangered. In his brief encounter with the bird, Steller was able to deduce that the jay was kin to the American blue jay, a fact which seemed proof that Alaska was indeed part of North America.

Despite the hardships the crew endured, Steller studied the flora, fauna, and topography of the island in great detail. Of particular note were the only detailed behavioral and anatomical observations of Steller&#x27;s sea cow, a large sirenian mammal that once ranged across the Northern Pacific during the Ice Ages, but whose surviving relict population was confined to the shallow kelp beds around the Commander Islands, and which was driven to extinction within 30 years of discovery by Europeans.

Based on these and other observations, Steller later wrote &quot;De Bestiis Marinis&quot; (&#x27;On the Beasts of the Sea&#x27;), describing the fauna of the island, including the northern fur seal, the sea otter, Steller sea lion, Steller&#x27;s sea cow, Steller&#x27;s eider and the spectacled cormorant. Steller claimed the only recorded sighting of the marine cryptid Steller&#x27;s sea ape.

<text>Celestún is a town in Yucatán, Mexico. It is located in the northwest corner of the state, just north of the border with the state of Campeche, on the Gulf of Mexico coast at


== On the town ==
In 2000, it had a population of just under 6,000 people; however, the population swells to 10,000 during the octopus hunting season. It is mostly a fishing town, with a 19th-century lighthouse (as well as a more modern one) and an abandoned historic hacienda. Besides fishing, Celestún also produces salt, as it has done from pre-Columbian times. Tourism is also making up an increasing portion of the town&#x27;s economy, as the community has many kilometers of sand beaches and abundant wildlife.

One of the busiest times for tourism is Holy Week, when people from around the region visit Celestun. Local folk-catholic traditions are abundant during this time, when the town&#x27;s patron saint is floated out to sea surrounded by candles, and visited by the patron saint of nearby Kinchil. There is a church in the town built during the colonial period 

As the town of Celestun is the seat of the municipality (&quot;municipio&quot;) of Celestun, it attracts various carnivals, dances and musicians to its town square on a regular basis.
==Geography==
It is located in the northwest corner of the state, just north of the border with the state of Campeche.

Surrounding the town is the 147,500-acre (600 km2) Ría Celestún Biosphere Reserve, a wetland reserve that is the winter home to vast flocks of flamingos, as well as many herons and other bird species. This location is set within the Petenes mangroves ecoregion. In addition, more than 200 species of birds pass through on migration, or live there. Celestun&#x27;s ecosystem is unique because of a combination of freshwater from the century estuary and saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico. The reserve also has two types of pelicans - large white Canadian and smaller gray Mexican ones. Celestun is also known as a hatching ground for endangered sea turtles. Wildlife conservationists have an ongoing project to protect the sea turtles from encroaching modernization.

<text>The Non-Proliferation Trust (NPT) is a U.S. nonprofit organization that, at the beginning of the 21st century, advocated storing 10,000 tons of U.S. nuclear waste in Russia for a fee of $15 billion paid to the Russian government and $250 million paid to a fund for Russian orphans. The group was headed by Admiral Daniel Murphy. This proposal was endorsed by the Russian atomic energy ministry, MinAtom, which estimated that the proposal could eventually generate $150 billion in revenue for Russia.

<text>Daniel Joseph Murphy Sr. (March 24, 1922 – September 21, 2001) was a four-star admiral in the United States Navy and an official in the Carter and Reagan administrations.

Murphy grew up in Brooklyn, and graduated from the University of Maryland and the Naval War College. He joined the Navy in 1943, during his second year at St. John&#x27;s University in New York, and flew anti-submarine patrols over the North Atlantic during World War II.

During the 1960s he was commanding officer of the aircraft carrier . He commanded the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean during the Arab-Israeli War of 1973 and the Cyprus crisis of 1974. He retired from active service in 1977. Murphy&#x27;s son, Vice Admiral Daniel J. Murphy Jr., later also commanded the Sixth Fleet, from 1998 to 2000.

Murphy was principal military assistant to successive Secretaries of Defense Melvin R. Laird and Elliot Richardson, deputy director of the CIA in 1976 and 1977, and Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy at the Pentagon from 1977 to 1980 under Jimmy Carter.

He was Vice President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s chief of staff from 1981 to 1985. During this period, a covert team of military operatives led by Vice-Admiral Arthur S. Moreau Jr. was sometimes run out of his office. His involvement in the Iran-Contra affair may have been greater than was realised at the time.

At the end of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s first term, Murphy left government to join the Washington D.C. lobbying and public relations firm Gray and Company (later Hill &amp; Knowlton Worldwide) as a vice chairman. He later founded Murphy &amp; Associates in Georgetown providing public affairs and consulting support to U.S. and international firms. He facilitated former President George H.W. Bush&#x27;s celebratory visit to Kuwait in 1993.

He died at the age of 79 in 2001 of a stomach aneurysm. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. Most of the computer&#x27;s internal hardware is in the lower part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.

Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use. They can run on both AC power and rechargable battery packs and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for mobile use. Laptops combine many of the input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer into a single unit, including a display screen (usually in diagonal size), small speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device (namely compact ones such as touchpads or pointing sticks). Hardware specifications may vary significantly between different types, models, and price points.

The word &quot;laptop&quot;, modeled after the term &quot;desktop&quot; (as in &quot;desktop computer&quot;), refers to the fact that the computer can be practically placed on the user&#x27;s lap; while the word &quot;notebook&quot; refers to most laptops sharing a form factor with paper notebooks. , in American English, the terms &quot;laptop&quot; and &quot;notebook&quot; are used interchangeably; in other dialects of English, one or the other may be preferred. The term &quot;notebook&quot; originally referred to a type of portable computer that was smaller and lighter than mainstream laptops of the time, but has since come to mean the same thing and no longer refers to any specific size.

Design elements, form factors, and construction can also vary significantly between models depending on the intended use. Examples of specialized models of laptops include 2-in-1 laptops, with keyboards that either be detached or pivoted out of view from the display (often marketed having a &quot;laptop mode&quot;), and rugged laptops, for use in construction or military applications. Portable computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small niche market, mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, for accountants, or travelling sales representatives. As portable computers evolved into modern laptops, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.
==History==


The history of the laptop follows closely behind the development of the personal computer itself. A &quot;personal, portable information manipulator&quot; was imagined by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC in 1968, and described in his 1972 paper as the &quot;Dynabook&quot;. The IBM Special Computer APL Machine Portable (SCAMP) was demonstrated in 1973. This prototype was based on the IBM PALM processor. The IBM 5100, the first commercially available portable computer, appeared in September 1975, and was based on the SCAMP prototype.

As 8-bit CPU machines became widely accepted, the number of portables increased rapidly. The first &quot;laptop-sized notebook computer&quot; was the Epson HX-20, invented (patented) by Suwa Seikosha&#x27;s Yukio Yokozawa in July 1980, introduced at the COMDEX computer show in Las Vegas by Japanese company Seiko Epson in 1981, and released in July 1982. It had an LCD screen, a rechargeable battery, and a calculator-size printer, in a chassis, the size of an A4 notebook. It was described as a &quot;laptop&quot; and &quot;notebook&quot; computer in its patent.


Both Tandy/RadioShack and Hewlett-Packard (HP) also produced portable computers of varying designs during this period. The first laptops using the flip form factor appeared in the early 1980s. The Dulmont Magnum was released in Australia in 1981–82, but was not marketed internationally until 1984–85. The GRiD Compass 1101, released in 1982, was used at NASA and by the military, among others. The Sharp PC-5000, the Ampere WS-1, and Gavilan SC were released between 1983 and 1985. The Toshiba T1100 won acceptance by PC experts and the mass market as a way to have PC portability.
From 1983 onward, several new input techniques were developed and included in laptops, including the touch pad (Gavilan SC, 1983), the pointing stick (IBM ThinkPad 700, 1992), and handwriting recognition (Linus Write-Top, 1987). Some CPUs, such as the 1990 Intel i386SL, were designed to use minimum power to increase the battery life of portable computers and were supported by dynamic power management features such as Intel SpeedStep and AMD PowerNow! in some designs.

Some laptops in the 1980s using red plasma displays could only be used when connected to AC power, and had a built in power supply.

The development of memory cards was driven in the 1980s by the need for a floppy-disk-drive alternative, having lower power consumption, less weight, and reduced volume in laptops. The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) was an industry association created in 1989 to promote a standard for memory cards in PCs. The specification for PCMCIA type I cards, later renamed PC Cards, was first released in 1990.

Displays reached 640x480 (VGA) resolution by 1988 (Compaq SLT/286), and color screens started becoming a common upgrade in 1991, with increases in resolution and screen size occurring frequently until the introduction of 17&quot; screen laptops in 2003. Hard drives started to be used in portables, encouraged by the introduction of 3.5&quot; drives in the late 1980s, and became common in laptops starting with the introduction of 2.5&quot; and smaller drives around 1990; capacities have typically lagged behind those of physically larger desktop drives.

Optical disc drives became common in full-size laptops around 1997: initially, CD-ROM drives, supplanted by CD-R, then DVD, then Blu-ray drives with writing capability. Starting around 2011, the trend shifted against internal optical drives, and as of 2022, they have largely disappeared, though are still readily available as external peripherals.

Resolutions of laptop webcams are 720p (HD), or 480p in lower-end laptops. The earliest-known laptops with 1080p (Full HD) webcams, like the Samsung 700G7C, were released in the early 2010s.

==Etymology==
The terms &quot;laptop&quot; and &quot;notebook&quot; trace their origins to the early 1980s, coined to describe portable computers in a size class smaller than the mainstream units (so-called &quot;luggables&quot;) but larger than pocket computers. The etymologist William Safire traced the origin of &quot;laptop&quot; to some time before 1984; the earliest attestation of &quot;laptop&quot; found by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dates to 1983. The word is modeled after the term &quot;desktop&quot;, as in &quot;desktop computer&quot;. &quot;Notebook&quot;, meanwhile, emerged earlier in 1982 to describe Epson&#x27;s HX-20 portable, whose dimensions roughly correspond to a letter-sized pad of paper. Notebooks emerged as their own separate market from laptops with the release of the NEC UltraLite in 1988.

Notebooks and laptops continued to occupy distinct market segments into the mid-1990s, but ergonomic considerations and customer preference for larger screens soon led to notebooks converging with laptops in the late 1990s. Now, the terms &quot;laptop&quot; and &quot;notebook&quot; are synonymous, with &quot;laptop&quot; being the more common term in most English-speaking territories.

== Types of laptops ==



Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have changed significantly, resulting in a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses. Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably Ultrabook), hard distinctions between these classes were rare, and their usage has varied over time and between sources. Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly used, with sizes distinguished largely by the size of the screen.

===Smaller and larger laptops===
There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware. All of these terms have fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities have gone up; except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models, by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a &quot;gaming laptop&quot; or a &quot;mobile workstation&quot; for professional use.

===Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1===


The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The &quot;hybrids&quot;, &quot;convertibles&quot;, and &quot;2-in-1s&quot; emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a &quot;tablet&quot; mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.

Convertibles are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. &quot;Hybrids&quot; have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. &quot;2-in-1s&quot; can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed &quot;2-in-1 detachable&quot; and &quot;2-in-1 convertibles&quot; respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop OS, such as Windows 10. 2-in-1s are often marketed as &quot;laptop replacement tablets&quot;.

2-in-1s are often very thin, around , and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an x86-architecture CPU (typically a low- or ultra-low-voltage model), such as the Intel Core i5, run a full-featured desktop OS like Windows 10, and have a number of typical laptop I/O ports, such as USB 3 and Mini DisplayPort.

2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a media consumption device but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run &quot;desktop&quot; applications, such as Adobe Photoshop. It is possible to connect multiple peripheral devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, and several external displays to a modern 2-in-1.

Microsoft Surface Pro-series devices and Surface Book are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachable, whereas Lenovo Yoga-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older Surface RT and Surface 2 have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of ARM processors and Windows RT do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets. Similarly, a number of hybrid laptops run a mobile operating system, such as Android. These include Asus&#x27;s Transformer Pad devices, examples of hybrids with a detachable keyboard design, which do not fall in the category of 2-in-1s.

===Rugged laptop===
A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.

==Hardware==

The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.

In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for components that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. Some laptops feature socketed processors with sockets such as the Socket G2, but many laptops use processors that are soldered to the motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM and storage that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced. This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large &quot;tower&quot; cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new motherboards, hard disks, sound cards, RAM, and other components can be added. Memory and storage can often be upgraded with some disassembly, but with the most compact laptops, there may be no upgradeable components at all.

The following sections summarize the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts.

===Display===
The typical laptop has a screen that, when unfolded, is upright to the user.

==== Screen technology ====
Laptop screens most commonly use liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology, although OLED panels have been used in some models. The display interfaces with the motherboard using the embedded DisplayPort protocol via the Low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) 30 or 40 pin connector. Earlier laptops use the FPD-Link standard. The panels are mainly manufactured by AU Optronics, BOE Technology, LG Display or Samsung Display.

==== Surface finish ====
Externally, it can be a &quot;glossy&quot; or a &quot;matte&quot; (anti-glare) screen.

==== Sizes ====
In the past, there was a broader range of marketing terms (both formal and informal) to distinguish between different sizes of laptops. These included netbooks, subnotebooks, ultra-mobile PC, and desktop replacement computers; these are sometimes still used informally, although they are generally not used anymore in manufacturer marketing.

 mainstream consumer laptops tend to come with 11&quot;, 13&quot; or 15&quot;-16&quot; screens; 14&quot; models are more popular among business machines. Larger and smaller models are available, but less common – there is no clear dividing line in minimum or maximum size. Machines small enough to be handheld (screens in the 6–8&quot; range) can be marketed either as very small laptops or &quot;handheld PCs&quot;, while the distinction between the largest laptops and &quot;All-in-One&quot; desktops is whether they fold for travel.

==== Resolution ====
Having a higher resolution display allows more items to fit onscreen at a time, improving the user&#x27;s ability to multitask, although, at the higher resolutions on smaller screens, the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area. Since the introduction of the MacBook Pro with Retina display in 2012, there has been an increase in the availability of &quot;HiDPI&quot; (or high pixel density) displays; this is generally considered to be anything higher than 1920 pixels wide. This has increasingly converged around 4K (3840-pixel-wide) resolutions.

External displays can be connected to most laptops, with most models supporting at least one. The use of technology such as USB4 (section Alternate Mode partner specifications). DisplayPort Alt Mode has been utilized to charge a laptop and provide display output over one USB-C Cable.

==== Refresh rates ====
Most laptop displays have a maximum refresh rate of 60 Hz. The Dell M17x and Samsung 700G7A, both released in 2011, were among the first laptops to feature a 120 Hz refresh rate, and more such laptops have appeared in the years since.

===Central processing unit (CPU)===
Laptop CPUs have advanced power-saving features and produce less heat than those intended for desktop use. Mainstream laptop CPUs made after 2018 have at least two processor cores, often four cores, and sometimes more, with 6 and 8 cores becoming more common.

For the low price and mainstream performance, there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop CPUs, but at the high end, the fastest desktop CPUs still substantially outperform the fastest laptop processors, at the expense of massively higher power consumption and heat generation; the fastest laptop processors top out at 56 watts of heat, while the fastest desktop processors top out at 150 watts (and often need water cooling).

There has been a wide range of CPUs designed for laptops available from both Intel, AMD, and other manufacturers. On non-x86 architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former PowerPC-based Apple laptops (iBook and PowerBook). Between around 2000 to 2014, most full-size laptops had socketed, replaceable CPUs; on thinner models, the CPU was soldered on the motherboard and was not replaceable or upgradable without replacing the motherboard. Since 2015, Intel has not offered new laptop CPU models with pins to be interchangeable, preferring ball grid array chip packages which have to be soldered; and as of 2021, only a few rare models using desktop parts.

In the past, some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have had high-performance gains at the cost of greater weight, heat, and limited battery life; this is not unknown as of 2022, but since around 2010, the practice has been restricted to small-volume gaming models. Laptop CPUs are rarely able to be overclocked; most use locked processors. Even on gaming models where unlocked processors are available, the cooling system in most laptops is often very close to its limits and there is rarely headroom for an overclocking–related operating temperature increase.

===Graphics processing unit (GPU)===
On most laptops, the GPU is integrated into the CPU to conserve power and space. This was introduced by Intel with the Core i-series of mobile processors in 2010, followed by similar AMD APU processors in January 2011.

Before that, lower-end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated into the system chipset, while higher-end machines had a separate graphics processor. In the past, laptops &quot;lacking&quot; a &quot;separate&quot; graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving 3D graphics, but the capabilities of CPU-integrated graphics have converged with the low-end of dedicated graphics processors since the mid-2010s. For laptops possessing limited onboard graphics capability but sufficient I/O throughput, an external GPU (eGPU) can provide additional graphics power at the cost of physical space and portability.

Higher-end laptops intended for gaming or professional 3D work still come with dedicated (and in some cases even dual) graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card. Since 2011, these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is &quot;no&quot; demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor, the more power-efficient &quot;integrated&quot; graphics processor will be used. Nvidia Optimus and AMD Hybrid Graphics are examples of this sort of system of switchable graphics.

Traditionally, the system RAM on laptops (as well as on desktop computers) was physically separate from the graphics memory used by the GPU. Apple&#x27;s M series SoCs feature a unified pool of memory for both the system and the GPU; this approach can produce substantial efficiency gains for some applications but comes at the cost of eGPU support.

===Memory===
Since around the year 2000, most laptops have used SO-DIMM slots in which RAM is mounted, although, as of 2021, an increasing number of models use memory soldered to the motherboard, either alongside SO-DIMM slots or without any slots and soldering all memory to the motherboard. A new form factor, the CAMM module, is slated to fix the size and timing limitation. Before 2000, most laptops used proprietary memory modules if their memory was upgradable.

In the early 2010s, high end laptops such as the 2011 Samsung &quot;700G7A&quot; have passed the 10 GB RAM barrier, featuring 16 GB of RAM.

When upgradeable, memory slots are sometimes accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading; in other cases, accessing them requires significant disassembly. Most laptops have two memory slots, although some will have only one, either for cost savings or because some amount of memory is soldered. Some high-end models have four slots; these are usually mobile engineering workstations, although a few high-end models intended for gaming do as well.

 8 GB RAM is most common, with lower-end models occasionally having 4 GB. Higher-end laptops may come with 16 GB of RAM or more.

===Internal storage===
The earliest laptops most often used floppy disks for storage, although a few used either RAM disk or tape. By the late 1980s hard disk drives had become the standard form of storage.

Between 1990 and 2009, almost all laptops typically had a hard disk drive (HDD) for storage; since then, solid-state drives (SSD) have gradually come to replace hard drives in all but some inexpensive consumer models. Solid-state drives are faster and more power-efficient, as well as eliminating the hazard of drive and data corruption caused by a laptop&#x27;s physical impacts, as they use no mechanical parts such as a rotational platter. In many cases, they are more compact as well. Initially, in the late 2000s, SSDs were substantially more expensive than HDDs, but prices on smaller capacity (under 1 terabyte) drives have converged; larger capacity drives remain more expensive than comparable-sized HDDs.

Since around 1990, where a hard drive is present it will typically be a 2.5-inch drive; some very compact laptops support even smaller 1.8-inch HDDs, and a very small number used 1&quot; Microdrives. Some SSDs are built to match the size/shape of a laptop hard drive, but increasingly they have been replaced with smaller mSATA or M.2 cards. SSDs using the newer and much faster NVM Express standard for connecting are only available as cards.

 many laptops no longer contain space for a 2.5&quot; drive, accepting only M.2 cards; a few of the smallest have storage soldered to the motherboard. For those that can, they can typically contain a single 2.5-inch drive, but a small number of laptops with a screen wider than 15 inches can house two drives.

A variety of external HDDs or NAS data storage servers with support of RAID technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as USB, FireWire, eSATA, or Thunderbolt, or over a wired or wireless network to further increase space for the storage of data. Many laptops also incorporate a SD or microSD card slot. This enables users to download digital pictures from an SD card onto a laptop, thus enabling them to delete the SD card&#x27;s contents to free up space for taking new pictures.

===Removable media drive===
Optical disc drives capable of playing CD-ROMs, compact discs (CD), DVDs, and in some cases, Blu-ray discs (BD), were nearly universal on full-sized models between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s. drives are uncommon in compact or premium laptops; they remain available in some bulkier models, but the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating these drives and players – when needed they can be connected via USB instead.
===Speaker===
Laptops usually have built-in speakers and built-in microphones. However, integrated speakers may be small and of restricted sound quality to conserve space.

===Inputs===

An alphanumeric keyboard is used to enter text, data, and other commands (e.g., function keys). A touchpad (also called a trackpad), a pointing stick, or both, are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen, and an integrated keyboard is used for typing. Some touchpads have buttons separate from the touch surface, while others share the surface. A quick double-tap is typically registered as a click, and operating systems may recognize multi-finger touch gestures.

An external keyboard and mouse may be connected using a USB port or wirelessly, via Bluetooth or similar technology. Some laptops have multitouch touchscreen displays, either available as an option or standard. Most laptops have webcams and microphones, which can be used to communicate with other people with both moving images and sound, via web conferencing or video-calling software.

Laptops typically have USB ports and a combined headphone/microphone jack, for use with headphones, a combined headset, or an external mic. Many laptops have a card reader for reading digital camera SD cards.

===Input/output (I/O) ports===
On a typical laptop, there are several USB ports; if they use only the older USB connectors instead of USB-C, they will typically have an external monitor port (VGA, DVI, HDMI or Mini DisplayPort or occasionally more than one), an audio in/out port (often in form of a single socket) is common. It is possible to connect up to three external displays to a 2014-era laptop via a single Mini DisplayPort, using multi-stream transport technology.

Apple, in a 2015 version of its MacBook, transitioned from a number of different I/O ports to a single USB-C port. This port can be used both for charging and connecting a variety of devices through the use of aftermarket adapters. Apple has since transitioned back to using a number of different ports. Google, with its updated version of Chromebook Pixel, shows a similar transition trend towards USB-C, although keeping older USB Type-A ports for a better compatibility with older devices. Although being common until the end of the 2000s decade, Ethernet network port are rarely found on modern laptops, due to widespread use of wireless networking, such as Wi-Fi. Legacy ports such as a PS/2 keyboard/mouse port, serial port, parallel port, or FireWire are provided on some models, but they are increasingly rare. On Apple&#x27;s systems, and on a handful of other laptops, there are also Thunderbolt ports, but Thunderbolt 3 uses USB-C. Laptops typically have a headphone jack, so that the user can connect headphones or amplified speaker systems for listening to music or other audio.

===Expansion cards===
In the past, a PC Card (formerly PCMCIA) or ExpressCard slot for expansion was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality, even when the laptop is powered on; these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of USB 3.0. Some internal subsystems such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards, usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop. The standard for such cards is PCI Express, which comes in both mini and even smaller M.2 sizes. In newer laptops, it is not uncommon to also see Micro SATA (mSATA) functionality on PCI Express Mini or M.2 card slots allowing the use of those slots for SATA-based solid-state drives.

Mobile PCI Express Module (MXM) is a type of expansion card that is used for graphics cards.

===Battery and power supply===
Since the late 1990s, laptops have typically used lithium ion or lithium polymer batteries, These replaced the older nickel metal-hydride typically used in the 1990s, and nickel–cadmium batteries used in most of the earliest laptops. A few of the oldest laptops used non-rechargeable batteries, or lead–acid batteries.

Battery life is highly variable by model and workload and can range from one hour to nearly a day. A battery&#x27;s performance gradually decreases over time; a noticeable reduction in capacity is typically evident after two to three years of regular use, depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery. Innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations in which the battery can provide up to 24 hours of continued operation, assuming average power consumption levels. An example is the HP EliteBook 6930p when used with its ultra-capacity battery.

Laptops with removable batteries may support larger replacement batteries with extended capacity.

A laptop&#x27;s battery is charged using an external power supply, which is plugged into a wall outlet. The power supply outputs a DC voltage typically in the range of 7.2—24 volts. The power supply is usually external and connected to the laptop through a DC connector cable. In most cases, it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously. When the battery is fully charged, the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply, avoiding battery use. If the used power supply is not strong enough to power computing components and charge the battery simultaneously, the battery may charge in a shorter period of time if the laptop is turned off or sleeping. The charger typically adds about to the overall transporting weight of a laptop, although some models are substantially heavier or lighter. Most 2016-era laptops use a smart battery, a rechargeable battery pack with a built-in battery management system (BMS). The smart battery can internally measure voltage and current, and deduce charge level and State of Health (SoH) parameters, indicating the state of the cells.

=== Power connectors ===

Historically, DC connectors, typically cylindrical/barrel-shaped coaxial power connectors have been used in laptops. Some vendors such as Lenovo made intermittent use of a rectangular connector.

Some connector heads feature a center pin to allow the end device to determine the power supply type by measuring the resistance between it and the connector&#x27;s negative pole (outer surface). Vendors may block charging if a power supply is not recognized as the original part, which could deny the legitimate use of universal third-party chargers.

With the advent of USB-C, portable electronics made increasing use of it for both power delivery and data transfer. Its support for 20 V (common laptop power supply voltage) and 5 A typically suffices for low to mid-end laptops, but some with higher power demands such as gaming laptops depend on dedicated DC connectors to handle currents beyond 5 A without risking overheating, some even above 10 A. Additionally, dedicated DC connectors are more durable and less prone to wear and tear from frequent reconnection, as their design is less delicate.

===Cooling===
Waste heat from the operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop. The earliest laptops used passive cooling; this gave way to heat sinks placed directly on the components to be cooled, but when these hot components are deep inside the device, a large space-wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat. Modern laptops instead rely on heat pipes to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device, to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system. Waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator towards the rear or sides of the device. Multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked, such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion. Secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat, such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case. Aftermarket cooling pads with external fans can be used with laptops to reduce operating temperatures.

===Docking station===
A docking station (sometimes referred to simply as a &quot;dock&quot;) is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports and in some cases expansion slots or bays for fixed or removable drives. A laptop connects and disconnects to a docking station, typically through a single large proprietary connector. A docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment, due to the possibility of a docking station transforming a laptop into a full-featured desktop replacement, yet allowing for its easy release. This ability can be advantageous to &quot;road warrior&quot; employees who have to travel frequently for work, and yet who also come into the office. If more ports are needed, or their position on a laptop is inconvenient, one can use a cheaper passive device known as a port replicator. These devices mate to the connectors on the laptop, such as through USB or FireWire.

===Charging trolleys===
Laptop charging trolleys, also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts, are mobile storage containers to charge multiple laptops, netbooks, and tablet computers at the same time. The trolleys are used in schools that have replaced their traditional static computer labs suites of desktop equipped with &quot;tower&quot; computers, but do not have enough plug sockets in an individual classroom to charge all of the devices. The trolleys can be wheeled between rooms and classrooms so that all students and teachers in a particular building can access fully charged IT equipment.

Laptop charging trolleys are also used to deter and protect against opportunistic and organized theft. Schools, especially those with open plan designs, are often prime targets for thieves who steal high-value items. Laptops, netbooks, and tablets are among the highest–value portable items in a school. Moreover, laptops can easily be concealed under clothing and stolen from buildings. Many types of laptop–charging trolleys are designed and constructed to protect against theft. They are generally made out of steel, and the laptops remain locked up while not in use. Although the trolleys can be moved between areas from one classroom to another, they can often be mounted or locked to the floor, support pillars, or walls to prevent thieves from stealing the laptops, especially overnight.

===Solar panels===
In some laptops, solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate. The One Laptop Per Child Initiative released the OLPC XO-1 laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels. They were designing an OLPC XO-3 laptop with these features. The OLPC XO-3 was planned to operate with 2 watts of electricity. Samsung has also designed the NC215S solar–powered notebook that was planned to be sold commercially in the U.S. market.

===Accessories===
A common accessory for laptops is a laptop sleeve, laptop skin, or laptop case, which provides a degree of protection from scratches. Sleeves, which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible, are most commonly made of neoprene, with sturdier ones made of low-resilience polyurethane. Some laptop sleeves are wrapped in ballistic nylon to provide some measure of waterproofing. Bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside and may have locks for added security. Metal, padded cases also offer protection against impacts and drops. Another common accessory is a laptop cooler, a device that helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop either actively or passively. A common active method involves using electric fans to draw heat away from the laptop, while a passive method might involve propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more airflow. Some stores sell laptop pads that enable a reclining person on a bed to use a laptop.

===Modularity===

Some of the components of earlier models of laptops can easily be replaced without opening completely its bottom part, such as the keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, and CPU cooling fan.

Some of the components of recent models of laptops reside inside. Replacing most of its components, such as the keyboard, battery, hard disk, memory modules, CPU cooling fan, etc., requires the removal of either the top or bottom part, the removal of the motherboard, and returning them.

In some types, solder and glue are used to mount components such as RAM, storage, and batteries, making repairs additionally difficult.

===Obsolete features===
Features that certain early models of laptops used to have that are not available in more recent models include:
* Reset (&quot;cold restart&quot;) button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)
* Instant power off button in a hole (needed a thin metal tool to press)
* Integrated charger or power adapter inside the laptop
* Dedicated Media buttons (Internet, Volume, Play, Pause, Next, Previous)
* Floppy disk drive
* Serial port
* Parallel port
* Modem
* IEEE 1394 port
* Docking port
* Shared PS/2 input device port
* IrDA
* S-video port
* S/PDIF audio port
* PC Card / PCMCIA slot
* ExpressCard slot
* CD/DVD Drives (starting with 2013 models)
* VGA port (starting with 2013 models)

==Characteristics==
===Advantages over desktop computers===

*Portability - Laptops are highly portable compared to desktop PCs. Physical portability allows a laptop to be used in many places—not only at home and the office but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients&#x27; locations or a meeting room, etc. Within a home, portability enables laptop users to move their devices from room to room. Portability offers several distinct advantages:
* Productivity: Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used can help employees and students to increase their productivity on work or school tasks, such as an office worker reading their work e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, or a student doing their homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures, for example.
* Up-to-date information: Using a single laptop prevents fragmentation of files across multiple PCs as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.
* Connectivity: A key advantage of laptops is that they almost always have integrated connectivity features such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and sometimes connection to cellular networks either through native integration or use of a hotspot. Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.

Other advantages of laptops:
* Size: Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away in a desk drawer.
* Low power consumption: Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 10–100 W, compared to 200–800W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for large businesses, which run hundreds of personal computers thus economies of scale, and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.).
* Quiet: Laptops are typically much quieter than desktops, due both to the components (often silent solid-state drives replacing hard drives) and to less heat production leading to the use of fewer, sometimes no cooling fans. The latter has given rise to laptops that have no moving parts, resulting in complete silence during use.
* Battery: a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts, an issue that is present with desktop PCs.
* All-in-One: designed to be portable, most modern laptops have all components integrated into the chassis. For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is usually divided into the desktop &quot;tower&quot; (the unit with the CPU, hard drive, power supply, etc.), keyboard, mouse, display screen, and optional peripherals such as speakers.

===Disadvantages===
Compared to desktop PCs, laptops have disadvantages in the following areas:

;Performance: The performance of laptops is often worse than comparably priced desktops. The upper limits of performance of laptops remain lower than desktops, due to mostly practical reasons, such as decreased battery life, increased size and heat, etc.
;Upgradeability: The upgradeability of laptops is limited compared to tower desktops, due to technical and economic reasons. In general, hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily. Due to the integrated nature of laptops, however, the motherboard, CPU, and graphics, are seldom officially upgradeable. Some efforts towards industry standard parts and layouts have been attempted, such as Common Building Block, but the industry remains largely proprietary and fragmented. There is no industry-wide standard form factor for laptops; Moreover, starting with 2013 models, laptops have become increasingly integrated (soldered) with the motherboard for most of its components (CPU, SSD, RAM, etc.) to reduce size and upgradeability prospects.
;Durability: Laptops are less durable than desktops/PCs. However, the durability of the laptop depends on the user if proper maintenance is done then the laptop can work longer.&lt;br&gt;Because of their portability, laptops are subject to more wear and physical damage than desktops, additionally hindered by their integrated nature. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, while a minor issue with a desktop system, can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer, resulting in a costly repair or entire replacement of laptops. One study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop. To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a lint-free or microfiber cloth for the screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and a cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.
;Heating and cooling: Laptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a fan and heat sink that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris. Most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems, resulting in a system that gradually conducts more heat and noise as the years pass. In some cases, the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels. This dust is usually stuck inside where the fan and heat sink meet, where it can not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming. Most of the time, compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it. After the device is turned on, the loose debris is reaccumulated into the cooling system by the fans. Complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely. However, preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build-up on the heat sink. Many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD).
;Battery life: Battery life is limited because the capacity drops with time, eventually warranting replacement after as little as 2–3 years. A new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for five to six hours or more, depending on usage and the battery size. The battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer charging and discharging time. Some laptops do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of their manufacturer or a third-party laptop service center to have their battery replaced. Replacement batteries can also be expensive, depending on the availability of the parts. Desktop PCs do not face similar problems since they are reliant on long lasting power supplies.
;Security and privacy:Because they are valuable, commonly used, portable, and easy to hide in a backpack or other type of bag, laptops are often stolen. Every day, over 1,600 laptops go missing from U.S. airports. The cost of stolen business or personal data, and of the resulting problems (identity theft, credit card fraud, breach of privacy), can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself. Consequently, the physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained in them are both of great importance. Some laptops, primarily professional and educational devices, have a Kensington security slot, which can be used to tether them with a security cable and lock. In addition, modern operating systems have features such as Activation Lock or similar that prevents the use of the device without credentials. some laptops also have additional security elements added, including biometric security components such as Windows Hello or Touch ID.&lt;br&gt;Software such as GadgetTrak and Find My Mac have been engineered to help people locate and recover their stolen laptops in the event of theft. Setting one&#x27;s laptop with a password on its firmware (protection against going to firmware setup or booting), internal HDD/SSD (protection against accessing it and loading an operating system on it afterward), and every user account of the operating system are additional security measures that a user should do. Fewer than 5% of lost or stolen laptops are recovered by the companies that own them, however, that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery. In the 2010s, the common availability of webcams on laptops raised privacy concerns. In &quot;Robbins v. Lower Merion School District&quot; (Eastern District of Pennsylvania 2010), school-issued laptops loaded with special software enabled staff from two high schools to take secret webcam shots of students at home, via their students&#x27; laptops.

====Ergonomics and health effects====

;Wrists: Prolonged use of laptops can cause repetitive strain injury because of their small, flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices. Usage of separate, external ergonomic keyboards and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time; they can be connected to a laptop easily by USB, Bluetooth or via a docking station. Some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces.
;Neck and spine: A laptop&#x27;s integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view, which can cause neck or spinal injuries. A larger and higher-quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate this and to provide additional screen space for more productive work. Another solution is to use a computer stand.
;Possible effect on fertility: A study by State University of New York researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap, potentially putting sperm count at risk. The study, which included roughly two dozen men between the ages of 21 and 35, found that the sitting position required to balance a laptop can increase scrotum temperature by as much as . However, further research is needed to determine whether this directly affects male sterility. A later 2010 study of 29 males published in &quot;Fertility and Sterility&quot; found that men who kept their laptops on their laps experienced scrotal hyperthermia (overheating) in which their scrotal temperatures increased by up to . The resulting heat increase, which could not be offset by a laptop cushion, may increase male infertility. &lt;br&gt;A common practical solution to this problem is to place the laptop on a table or desk or to use a book or pillow between the body and the laptop. Another solution is to obtain a cooling unit for the laptop. These are usually USB powered and consist of a hard thin plastic case housing one, two, or three cooling fans – with the entire assembly designed to sit under the laptop in question – which results in the laptop remaining cool to the touch, and greatly reduces laptop heat buildup.

;Thighs:Heat generated from using a laptop on the lap can also cause skin discoloration on the thighs known as &quot;toasted skin syndrome&quot;.

==Sales==
===Manufacturers===

There are many laptop brands and manufacturers. Several major brands that offer notebooks in various classes are listed in the adjacent box. The major brands usually offer good service and support, including well-executed documentation and driver downloads that remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced. Capitalizing on service, support, and brand image, laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops from smaller brands and ODMs. Some brands specialize in a particular class of laptops, such as gaming laptops (Alienware), high-performance laptops (HP Envy), netbooks (EeePC) and laptops for children (OLPC).

Many brands, including the major ones, do not design and do not manufacture their laptops. Instead, a small number of Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) design new models of laptops, and the brands choose the models to be included in their lineup. In 2006, 7 major ODMs manufactured 7 of every 10 laptops in the world, with the largest one (Quanta Computer) having 30% of the world market share. Therefore, identical models are available both from a major label and from a low-profile ODM in-house brand.

==== Historic market share ====

As of 1992–1993, Toshiba ranked as the global leading vendor in the notebook computer market. In the United States meanwhile, Apple led the market followed by Compaq. In the year 1993, global revenue for the laptop market was led by Compaq, followed by Toshiba, Apple, NEC and IBM, altogether accounting for over 53% of global revenue.

In the United States, the top three vendors for notebooks in market share as of 1996 were: Toshiba, followed by Compaq, and followed by IBM.

As of 1999, Toshiba ranked first in worldwide laptop sales followed by IBM, Compaq, and Dell. Toshiba led the market with a share of 18.6%.

In the first quarter of 2002 in the United States market, Dell controlled 25.2% in the notebook space, well ahead of Toshiba (13.6%) and Compaq (11.7%), the latter of which had been acquired by Hewlett-Packard (HP). At fourth and fifth place were Sony and IBM.

In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) territories, Acer was the largest vendor of laptops, in 2004–2005, having overtaken HP and IBM there.

In the year 2005 according to IDC, Dell was the top global vendor of notebooks with a market share of 17.29%, followed by: HP (15.7%), Toshiba (10.96%), Acer (10.15%) and Lenovo (8.23%); Lenovo had acquired IBM that same year. The remaining of the top ten was made up of Fujitsu Siemens, Sony, NEC, Apple and Asus.

In the first quarter of 2010, the largest vendor of portable computers, including netbooks, was either HP or Acer, depending on data source. Both had shipped approximately 9 million units each. Dell, Toshiba, Asus and Lenovo followed, each with approximate sales of 5 to 6 million each. Apple, Samsung and Sony sold under 2 million each.

As of the third quarter of 2020, HP was cited as the leading vendor for notebook computers closely followed by Lenovo, both with a share of 23.6% each. They were followed by Dell (13.7%), Apple (9.7%) and Acer (7.9%).

=== Adoption by users ===
Battery-powered portable computers had just 2% worldwide market share in 1986. However, laptops have become increasingly popular, both for business and personal use. The third quarter of 2008 was the first time when worldwide notebook PC shipments exceeded desktops, with 38.6 million units versus 38.5 million units. In 2023, it was estimated that 166 million laptops were sold, and in the first quarter of 2024, around 64% of personal computers sold were laptops or detachable tablets. Due to the advent of tablets and affordable laptops, many computer users now have laptops due to the convenience offered by the device.

=== Price ===
Before 2008, laptops were very expensive. In May 2005, the average notebook sold for while desktops sold for an average of . Around 2008, however, prices of laptops decreased substantially due to low-cost netbooks, drawing an average at U.S. retail stores in August 2008. Starting with the 2010s, laptops have decreased substantially in price at the low end due to inexpensive and low power Arm processors, less demanding operating systems such as ChromeOS, and SoC&#x27;s. , a new laptop can be obtained for .

== Disposal ==

The list of materials that go into a laptop computer is long, and many of the substances used, such as beryllium, lead, chromium, and mercury compounds, are toxic or carcinogenic to humans. Although these toxins are relatively harmless when the laptop is in use, concerns that discarded laptops cause a serious health and environmental risks when improperly discarded have arisen. The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) in Europe specified that all laptop computers must be recycled by law. Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has outlawed landfill dumping or the incinerating of discarded laptop computers.

Most laptop computers begin the recycling process with a method known as Demanufacturing, which involves the physical separation of the components of the laptop. These components are then either grouped into materials (e.g. plastic, metal and glass) for recycling or more complex items that require more advanced materials separation (e.g.) circuit boards, hard drives and batteries.

Corporate laptop recycling can require an additional process known as data destruction. The data destruction process ensures that all information or data that has been stored on a laptop hard drive can never be retrieved again. Below is an overview of some of the data protection and environmental laws and regulations applicable for laptop recycling data destruction:

* Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA)
* EU Privacy Directive (Due 2016)
* Financial Conduct Authority
* Sarbanes-Oxley Act
* PCI-DSS Data Security Standard
* Waste, Electronic &amp; Electrical Equipment Directive (WEEE)
* Basel Convention
* Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
* FACTA Sarbanes-Oxley Act
* FDA Security Regulations (21 C.F.R. part 11)
* Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
* HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
* NIST SP 800–53
* Add NIST SP 800–171
* Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act
* Patriot Act of 2002
* PCI Data Security Standard
* US Safe Harbor Provisions
* Various state laws
* 6/3 JAN
* Gramm-leach-Bliley Act
* DCID
==Extreme use==

The ruggedized Grid Compass computer was used since the early days of the Space Shuttle program. The first commercial laptop used in space was a Macintosh portable in 1990 on Space Shuttle mission STS-41 and again in 1991 aboard STS-43. Apple and other laptop computers continue to be flown aboard crewed spaceflights, though the only long-duration flight certified computer for the International Space Station is the ThinkPad. As of 2011, over 100 ThinkPads were aboard the ISS. Laptops used aboard the International Space Station and other spaceflights are generally the same ones that can be purchased by the general public but needed modifications are made to allow them to be used safely and effectively in a weightless environment such as updating the cooling systems to function without relying on hot air rising and accommodation for the lower cabin air pressure. Laptops operating in harsh usage environments and conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty conditions differ from those used in space in that they are custom designed for the task and do not use commercial off-the-shelf hardware.

<text>Jēkabpils () is a state city in Jēkabpils Municipality in southeastern Latvia, located roughly halfway between the capital Riga and Daugavpils, and spanning the Daugava River. The name of the city literally translates into &quot;Castle of Jacob&quot;. Historic Jēkabpils lies on the left bank, in Selonia, while the historic Krustpils () lies on the right bank, in Latgale. The two cities were united during the Soviet rule in 1962 under the Jēkabpils name, but retain their distinct regional character.

Jēkabpils was also formerly home to the Soviet Jēkabpils Air Base.

==History==

A stone cross-castle – Cruczeborch () – was built in 1237 by the bishop of Riga. Archeological excavations on the nearby Asote mound indicate that this place was a busy trading centre for the Latgalians, one of the Latvian tribes, and had been inhabited since 1000 BC. An adjoining settlement already existed when Krustpils Castle was first built; it grew up around the castle as the village of Krustpils. The village was often destroyed during local wars, such as Polish-Swedish battles, but was always rebuilt afterward.

During the 17th century, persecuted Old Believers from Russia settled along the Daugava river. In 1670 this settlement, gradually growing around the Sala Inn, became known as Jēkabpils ( in German) in honor of the Duke of Courland, Jacob Kettler, who granted Magdeburg rights to the town.

A local legend about the town&#x27;s origin states that the duke was hunting one day but became lost. At the Daugava River, he simultaneously spotted a lynx underneath a fir tree as well as a town at the same time. This image of the lynx underneath a fir tree is the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

In the period of the Duchy of Courland the residents of the town were mostly Russian Old believers, Poles and Lithuanians. Duke Jacob built a small port in the town to transport goods from a nearby iron foundry. At the end of the 17th century, there were an anchor mint, a gun foundry, lime and tar kilns and several other factories in Jacobstadt.

In 1704, during the Great Northern War, the Russians occupied the town. However, after few months a major battle (Battle of Jēkabpils), took place near the town. A Swedish army under Adam Lewenhaupt defeated a much larger Russian force and thus stopped Russian Empire from further invasion in the Duchy.

After the war and an epidemic of plague, the town again prospered. Barges from Belarus imported grain, honey, tobacco, spirits, textiles etc. At the same time, land transport from Friedrichstadt amounted to approx. 9,000 cart loads a year during the second half of the 18th century. Jacobstadt was also part of the postal road from Jelgava to Friedrichstadt and further to Ilūkste.
In 1764 the first ferry crossing to Krustpils was opened in the town. During the reign of Peter von Biron a small community of German-speaking craftsmen developed in the town besides Russians and Poles. Jews, however, were prohibited from entering the town. In 1795 Jacobstadt, like the whole Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was incorporated into the Russian Empire.

In 1826 Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve made his geodesic measurements near the town.&lt;br&gt;
In 1834 the first hospital was opened in the town. During this period a theater and library were also opened, and the first streets were cobbled.&lt;br&gt;
In 1861 with the opening of the Riga–Daugavpils railway through Krustpils the role of the Daugava and barges as a main means of transport decreased. However, the river was still used for timber rafting.
At the turn of the 20th century there were a bank, an insurance company, a match factory, a steam mill, a brewery, typography and several other enterprises. During the First World War heavy battles were fought around the town and some 280 buildings in the town were destroyed or damaged.

In 1919 Jēkabpils became the administrative centre of the newly established Jaunjelgava district. In 1932 a sugar refinery was built in the town. In 1936 a bridge was built over the Daugava. In this way Jēkabpils and Krustpils were united for the first time.
During the Second World War the bridge was blown up. A new bridge was constructed only in 1962.

Jēkabpils and Krustpils were merged in 1962 under the name Jēkabpils. During the Soviet period the united city was home to several big factories. Among them were the sewing enterprise &quot;Asote&quot;, the dolomite splinter mine &quot;Dolomīts&quot;, a reinforced concrete construction factory, a dairy processing plant and several other enterprises.
After the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991 many factories went bankrupt or production was drastically reduced.

From 2009 to 2021, the city, while being a separate first-level municipality (republican city, &quot;republikas pilsēta&quot;), was also the extraterritorial center of Jēkabpils Municipality. Since 2021, it retains state city status, but does not have a separate first-level local government.

<text>Caesaraugusta or Caesar Augusta was the name of the Roman city of Zaragoza, founded as a &quot;Colonia Inmune&quot; from Rome in 14 BC, possibly on December 23, on the intensely Romanized Iberian city of Salduie. Its foundation occurred in the context of the reorganization of the provinces of Hispania by Caesar Augustus after his victory in the Astur-Cantabrian wars.
The new city received the name of &quot;Colonia Caesar Augusta&quot;. It enjoyed the privilege of bearing the full name of its founder, who entrusted its &quot;deductio&quot;, like many other tasks of the Empire, to his general and close friend Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa.

Veteran soldiers of the legions IV Macedonica, VI Victrix and X Gemina, discharged after the hard campaign against the Asturians and Cantabrians, participated in the foundation of the city, with the double intention of guaranteeing the defense of the territory at the same time as establishing the presence of Rome in it. Zaragoza had the status of an &quot;Colonia Inmune&quot;, granting it certain privileges such as the right to mint coins or the exemption from paying taxes. The new citizens were attached to the Aniense tribe.

In the process of reorganization of Hispanic territories, three provinces were created, Tarraconense, Baetica and Lusitania, divided into juridical convents, minor districts with judicial and administrative functions; of these, the one governed by Caesaraugusta, the &quot;conventus juridicus Caesaraugustanus&quot;, was one of the largest of the seven into which the province of Tarraconense was divided. Caesaraugusta assumed from the beginning the role of regional head, replacing the colony Victrix Ivlia Celsa (in the current Velilla de Ebro).

The period of the city&#x27;s greatest apogee in the first and second centuries brought many of the great public works, some of which can still be seen today: the &quot;forum&quot;, the river port, which made Caesaraugusta the main redistributor of goods in the Ebro valley, the public baths, the theater or the city&#x27;s first bridge, located on the site of the current Stone Bridge and which was probably a work of ashlar or a mixture of stone and wood.

Water also played an important role in Roman Zaragoza, both for its location on the banks of the Ebro River and next to the mouth of the Huerva and Gállego rivers, as well as for its complex supply and irrigation systems. In addition to the aforementioned baths, a multitude of cisterns, fountains, sewers and various sections of lead and sanitation pipes have been documented.
== The foundation as an inmune mixed colony ==

Caesar Augusta was founded in 14 B.C. — although other dates have been proposed for the foundation of the city, ranging from 25 to 12 B.C.— as a &quot;Colonia inmunis&quot; where soldiers from the legions that fought with Caesar Augustus in Hispania between 29 and 26 B.C. were integrated into the Iberian Salduie, forming a new Roman colonial city of mixed character, as Strabo reflects in his &quot;Geographica&quot; (III, 2, 15).

The new Colonia inmune occupied an area of 44 hectares, delimiting an area of more than 900 x 500 m around two axial axes of communication: the &quot;maximum decumanus&quot; (present-day Mayor and Espoz y Mina and Manifestación streets) and the cardo, which coincided approximately in its route with Jaime I street, although the confluence with the decumanus at the southern limit —located in the present-day Coso Alto and which could be found at any point from the Main Theater to the &quot;Cinegia Gate&quot;— is uncertain, since the layout of the aforementioned street in its southern half dates from a reform of the 18th century.

The city had four main entrances, whose location was preserved until the 15th century, at both ends of the cardo and the decumanus:

* Puerta de Toledo. It was located at the western end of the &quot;decumanum&quot;, between the present walls of San Juan de los Panetes and the Central Market. In its Roman site there was a gate flanked by two crenellated towers —whose starts were probably Roman wall cubes— until 1848 when it was demolished. Its foundations still remain, discovered in the last quarter of the 20th century. A monument by Martín Trenor and the bronze statue of &quot;Augusto di Prima Porta&quot;, a gift from Mussolini in 1940, on a pedestal of black Calatorao stone, commemorate the site since 1989.
* Gate of Valencia. East end of the decumanum, in the middle of the current Coso Bajo. An inscription to the &quot;Porta romana&quot; was found on an ashlar, indicating its location.
* North Gate, or Angel Gate, located at the northern end of the cardo, and that led to the Stone Bridge. It was preserved until the Sieges of Saragossa, at the beginning of the 19th century, and can be seen in full use in 1647 in the View of Zaragoza (&quot;Vista de Zaragoza en 1647&quot;) by Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo.
* Cinegia Gate. South end of the thistle. Its name comes from the Arab quarter of Sinhaya, and its location is uncertain, as it may have been somewhere between the Main Theater and Plaza España in Zaragoza.
The city of Caesaraugusta thus became the most influential city in the middle valley of the Ebro, and its coinage spread throughout the interior of Tarraconensis, becoming predominant even in the current province of Soria.

The whole design of the colony was meticulously planned before its execution. The city was soon provided with a bridge, probably made of stone, a &quot;forum&quot;, aqueducts and a sewage system with drainage sewers. However, the most recent studies support the hypothesis that these infrastructures, bridge, river port, &quot;forum&quot;, market, pre-existed the Roman foundation, although in many cases they were reformed and enlarged, as happened with the forum, in the time of Tiberius. The bridge, the port and the baths may have been part of the endowments of the highly Romanized Salduie of the years 50-14 B.C. Due to this, the construction activity between 14 B.C. and 14 A.D. was limited if we consider the enormous urban works undertaken from the government of Tiberius, with the construction of the theater or the remodeling of the forum, among other actions.

Until the end of the 20th century, the limits of the 1st century city were considered to be established by the remains of the preserved walls. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, a different evolution of the Roman city of Caesaraugusta took hold. According to the remains of the first and second centuries found outside the perimeter of the preserved walls (Plaza de la Magdalena, Antonio Agustín, Rebolería, Añón and Teniente Coronel Valenzuela streets, to cite a few examples), the initial extension of the city would occupy the current neighborhood of Magdalena and Tenerías to the east until the course of the Huerva river, and to the south a strip of land that would reach Cinco de Marzo and San Miguel streets, parallel to the Coso Alto. One of the arguments presented is that in the second half of the 2nd century, houses in this area were abandoned, suggesting the construction of the wall to the south and east at this time, which would cause the population to move from this area to the interior of the walls. A probable hypothesis is that the western and northern limits would have remained stable since the foundation of the city, even with a wall of &quot;opus caementicium&quot; that protected the most unprotected area, while in the east the wall was unnecessary in its early days thanks to the natural protection of the course of the Huerva, which would mark the eastern limit. In the 3rd century, in any case, the perimeter described above was definitively built or rebuilt with an ashlar wall, of which abundant remains are preserved.
=== Wall ===
The ritual plowing of a an act long shown on the reverses of the city&#x27;s coinageand erection of a city wall were general requisites of ancient Roman urban planning, particularly with regard to its formal colonies. Therefore, the existence of a wall at the founding of the colony and its subsequent rebuilding in the 3rd century were long taken for granted. However, abundant archaeological remains make it doubtful that Caesaraugusta had a wall that surrounded the entire perimeter of the city until the 3rd century, at least not in the appearance shown by the remains of canvases preserved today, especially on the eastern side, where the city was protected by the Huerva river.

The discovery in 2000 of the House of Añón Street and its location in the eastern part of the city, outside the walls of what was supposed to be the area included within the walls of Caesaraugusta, together with other archaeological remains found, have led to the assumption that the urbanized area extended in its beginnings beyond the walled Roman city of the 3rd century and it has even been postulated (according to research from 2003), that the Roman colony of Caesaraugusta may have initially lacked walls, particularly those located to the east.

=== Bridge ===
The existence of a bridge over the Ebro River at the location of the current Stone Bridge (probably already existing in Salduie&#x27;s time) is documented from the discovery of lead pipes that supported the bridge and brought drinking water from the nearby Gallego River to the city. It is more difficult to elucidate whether the bridge was already built in ashlar stone in Roman times, although the prestige of the capital of the Caesaraugustan legal convent and the required solidity derived from its function as an aqueduct of heavy pipes leads us to think that it was a stone bridge.
=== Augustan Forum ===
The forum of the Augustan or Saluitan period (located in the current Plaza de la Seo and the museum of the river port) had a mercantile character linked to the transport of goods to and from Tortosa across the Ebro, and was very possibly in operation before the Roman colonial foundation. Attached to the east of the cardo, it consisted of a quadrangular square open to the river, limited only on its long sides, which housed two bodies of commercial premises (seven tabernacles preserved on the east side), erected on plinths of &quot;opus vittatum&quot; and painting of the early style III. A simple covered portico closed the forum on the south side.

=== Hydraulic equipment ===
The Roman colony of Caesaragusta had a whole network of sewers, with drains and pipes and drinking water supply guaranteed through aqueducts that collected the water in large collecting cisterns, and whose archaeological remains have been excavated mainly since the last decade of the 20th century. In addition, in the district of the Tanneries, there was a drainage system for the periodic flooding of the Ebro, consisting of a field of amphorae grouped together and placed inverted.

Under the forum, and perpendicular to the Ebro, a large drainage sewer was designed: 2.82 m high and 2 m wide. It was built in &quot;opus caementicium&quot; with &quot;opus incertum&quot; lining. Other drainage systems in the city had notable dimensions, without reaching those of the main sewer. Thus, there is a section in Espoz y Mina Street made of &quot;opus vittatum&quot; 1.2 m high by 0.6 m wide. The proportions of the sewers of Caesaraugusta are similar to those of other large Roman cities, and comparable, for example, to those of Augusta Emerita.

=== High-Imperial Administration ===
From the time of the foundation of the city, Caesar Augusta was governed by two groups formed from the preeminent Roman citizens: the &quot;ordo decuriornum&quot; or curia (the local senate) and the &quot;ordo Caesaragustanum&quot; (a group of magistrates), which made up an ordo or order of citizens of the highest rank, initially drawn from among the officers and veterans of the legions and appointed by the commanders to establish the first curia.

At the head of the government of the city were two duumvirs, equivalent to the Roman consuls at the local level, whose name appeared on the coinage. Exceptionally, they could be substituted by a prefect with attributions directly emanating from Rome.

The duumvirs were assisted by a couple of &quot;aediles&quot;, in charge of the good functioning of the industries, public works and grain supply silos (&quot;horrea&quot;), and a &quot;quaestor&quot; who was in charge of the administration.

The first duumvirs of Caesar Augusta were &quot;Quintus Lutatius, Marcus Fabius, Gaius Alsanus, Titus Cervius, Lucius Cassius&quot; and &quot;Gaius Valerius Fenestella&quot;, whose names refer to Italic families. Only the name of one aedile is known, &quot;Marcus Julius Antonianus&quot;, documented in the inscriptions on the lead pipes that, with aqueduct functions, were integrated into the bridge over the Ebro.

Caesaraugusta was the capital of one of the seven judicial districts (&quot;conventus iuridicus&quot;) of the province of Tarraco. The &quot;conventus Caesaraugustanus&quot; was one of the largest and included Pamplona and Irún to the north, Calahorra to the west, Alcalá de Henares to the south and Lérida to the east.

Thus, Caesaraugusta was a center where legal matters were to be resolved in the second instance, whenever they could not be solved in the municipal jurisdiction. In addition, it had a religious capital, with its own cult, since it had a &quot;Genius conventus caesaraugustani&quot; with its own priesthood and received tributes and sacred offerings from all the cities of the administrative demarcation. According to Fatás and Beltrán (1998), the remains of the Basilica found in the &quot;Palacio de los Pardo&quot;, at the confluence between the cardo and the decumanus, would constitute the solemn and religious forum; while the forum excavated under the plaza of La Seo would serve as the commercial and administrative forum of the city.

== 1st century A.D. ==
During this period, the new Colonia inmune experienced significant economic growth, judging by the volume of coinage minted and the scale of the public works carried out, which, at a good pace, ended up giving the Caesaraugustean city the physiognomy of a large city.

The entire bank of the Ebro was terraced at this time to prevent flooding up to a level equal to the current level of the Plaza del Pilar. The scope of these works solved for the future the risk of flooding of the Ebro, and Zaragoza benefited from it until today. The area around the city was also extensively cleared in order to develop agricultural land to supply the colony.
=== Forum of Tiberius ===
The most outstanding work in the time of Tiberius (14 A.D. - 37) was the remodeling of the &quot;forum&quot;, which was enlarged by designing a large rectangle of more than 50 meters on the western side, which housed tents built with ashlar masonry and provided with a basement. Its entire perimeter housed a double interior &quot;portico&quot; that may have been closed to the south with a large imperial temple with a double colonnade peristyle, although the configuration of the south side and presence of the temple is still conjectural. It was paved with limestone slabs and built with various techniques of rigging: &quot;opus vittatum&quot;, &quot;opus africanum&quot; and &quot;opus caementicium&quot; or Roman concrete.

The &quot;forum&quot; of Tiberius housed, in addition to the temple, other buildings and monuments of representative and institutional character. Traces of the &quot;curia&quot; building and pedestals supporting an iconographic sculptural program dedicated to Augustus, his family and his successors have been traced. Near the maximum sewer that runs under the forum was found a statue of a boy from the time of Nero or Domitian, whom it could represent.

On the other hand, there is a cereal storage area to the north of the forum, which was accessed from the river port by means of a monumental staircase with a triple-passage door. The remains of this stairway can be seen in the Caesaragusta River Port Museum.

Finally, in the excavations of the &quot;Palacio de los Pardo&quot;, current site of the Camón Aznar Museum, remains of a wall were found at the end of the 20th century that would have formed part of a temple or basilica and was perhaps the most relevant building of a forensic complex of a religious nature, and not commercial as would be that of the Plaza de las Catedrales. According to another theory of the location of the cardo, it could start from this forum and not need the setback that would lead to the door Cinegia from the street of Don Jaime I (also called San Gil), depending on the hypothesis and planimetry proposed by Maria Pilar Galve in 2004.

=== Theater ===
To this period also belongs the major work of the theater, whose construction began at the end of the government of Tiberius and was completed in the time of Claudius around 50 A.D. It occupied a site that had been destined for this theatrical infrastructure since the colonial planning of the period of Caesar Augustus.

It was inspired by the model of the Theatre of Marcellus of Rome. A concrete structure (&quot;opus caementicium&quot;) was used in its construction to raise the grandstand that, in its exterior façade of three floors and twenty-two meters high, was covered with marble slabs or &quot;opus quadratum&quot; ashlars offering a monumental decoration.

It had, however, a singular independent access from the central door of the façade to the orchestra of perpendicular layout to the tables or scena and that ran like an axis through the theater for the use of the authorities, who thus had direct access to the seats reserved for them in the orchestral semicircle. This exclusive access can also be seen in the theaters of Turin or Minturno —although it is unique among those of Roman Hispania— and may be due to the variety of shows, not only dramatic, but perhaps also gladiatorial, which would be held there.

It is one of the largest theaters in Hispania, with a surface area of 7,000 square meters (106 m in diameter) and a capacity for approximately 6,000 spectators.

=== Other public works: temples and baths ===

At the end of the 1980s, in the course of the remodeling works of the &quot;Plaza del Pilar&quot;, the foundations and part of the &quot;podium&quot; of a Capitoline temple appeared, located where today is the subway parking lot of the square, quite far from the only known forum, together with the fact that it has an E-W axis orientation (entrance from the east), suggesting the existence of two connected forums.

Apart from this finding, the appearance of the temples can be documented through the coins issued in Zaragoza. In a &quot;dupondius&quot; of the year 28 is represented a temple of hexastyle type that was accessed through three steps, with columns of attic type and a simple pediment decorated geometrically with inscribed triangles that was dedicated to the &quot;pietas augusti&quot;. Later, in an as of the year 33 appears another tetrastyle temple of Corinthian columns with fluting.

In the final Julio-Claudian stage, which includes the governments of Caligula, Claudius and Nero, numerous public works were also carried out, which ended up giving the city its definitive appearance in its ancient classical stage. Basically, empty plots of land were filled in, and landscaped spaces and other important infrastructures were built, such as the public baths that appeared on San Juan and San Pedro Street, which have now been converted into a museum space.

Of these public baths, a swimming pool or &quot;natatio&quot; is preserved in good condition, surrounded by columns following examples of Roman representation. It would be a bathing facility arranged in consecutive axis, following the sequence &quot;natatio, frigidaria, tepidaria&quot; and &quot;caldaria&quot;. The interior was decorated with marble slabs on the floors and walls, with the addition of floral ornamentation in the Julio-Claudian tradition. There were more public baths, and numerous private baths in private homes. Among the first are those found in the square of the cathedrals, from the time of Nero or Vespasian.

=== Ceramics ===
In terms of material culture, in the second half of the first century A.D. there was a greater presence of Hispanic ceramics, found in the various dwellings excavated in Saragossa. Likewise, the appearance of ceramics from North Africa is documented and, in glazed ceramics, the colony continues to be nourished by production centers in the north of the Italic peninsula.

The presence for the first time of pottery for everyday use from pottery workshops in Zaragoza, located in Calle Predicadores, from the middle of the first century AD, is very significant.

=== Late 1st century A.D. ===
With the Flavian dynasty, the communication routes with the surroundings of Caesaraugusta were strengthened, as evidenced by a milestone located on the road to Bílbilis. New plots of land were inhabited in the city, such as the one at 6 Torrenueva Street. In addition, remains of boulder walls have been found outside the perimeter traditionally considered urbanized in 6 Palomeque Street, of a house in Heroísmo Street, next to the remains of an urban road, and of a &quot;nymphaeum&quot; in 4 Doctor Palomar Street with a pond, a fountain and mural paintings. Major renovations were also undertaken in the theater.

== 2nd century A.D. ==

It is still a period of emerging economy, as can be attested by the completion of the road leading to the capital of Lusitania, Augusta Emerita.

The Antonine period is characterized by the expansion of the city&#x27;s economic activities into rural areas, causing a significant growth of agricultural villas. An example of this is the one found between Alfonso V and Rebolería streets. It was centralized around a porticoed &quot;impluvium&quot; endowed with a central statue of a drunken Faun lying on a wineskin from which liquid flows, and has a parallel in the statues of recumbent nymphs of the villa of &quot;Virunum&quot;. The site was built from the 1st century, which gives another proof that the city, before the 3rd century, extended to the banks of the Huerva.

Numerous examples of &quot;domus&quot; (or single-family houses) of wealthy citizens of the city had private baths, although other public thermal establishments have also appeared, such as those in the &quot;Plaza de Santa Marta&quot;, which preserved the remains of paintings of garlands and flowers. However, archaeological prospections have so far not documented the presence of &quot;insulae&quot;, or blocks of apartments.

Caesaraugusta is already a city with an agricultural perimeter of great importance, irrigated by the four rivers that converge in its vicinity (Jalón, Huerva, Gállego and Ebro); &quot;necropolis&quot; located on the margins of the access roads to the city and a set of industrial workshops among which the potteries stand out.

Towards the end of the 2nd century, polychrome and decorative mosaics appear, such as the one in the great &quot;domus&quot; of San Juan de los Panetes dedicated to Orpheus (perhaps from the 3rd century). Other mosaics of great beauty are those of &quot;Eros and Pan&quot;, &quot;Eros and Psyche&quot; and the &quot;Triumph of Bacchus&quot; (also dated at the beginning of the 21st century in the 3rd century), found between Coso Alto and Alfonso I streets.

The remains of a &quot;domus&quot; with polychrome mural paintings, including representations of the muses, were also found at the end of the 20th century in Calle San Agustín 5-7. It is a style dated to the time of Hadrian (117-138), new in Caesaraugusta and characterized by a range of warm tones and figurative representation. It increases the size of the pictorial ornamentation of the walls of the houses. Alongside these complex decorations, simpler models continue to appear, decorating the walls with marble imitations, which will last until the 4th century.

== 3rd century A.D. ==

Although the first half of the 3rd century AD is quite unknown as far as Caesaraugusta is concerned, this is a period of significant changes in the city. The surviving walls were rebuilt or constructed in this century, since it was an unstable period, corroborating the fact that the city of Rome itself had to be walled in this century when it felt threatened. The remains of the wall that can be seen today are a stretch of about eighty meters between the Central Market and the church of San Juan de los Panetes and the lower part of another stretch of two cubes in the northeast corner (&quot;Paseo de Echegaray y Caballero&quot;).

In the 3rd century the theater of Caesaraugusta is modified again, which may indicate a new function for the space of this building, where perhaps the theatrical spectacle itself is no longer preeminent, in favor of the celebration of other types of entertainment.

On the other hand, the 3rd century saw a proliferation of large houses representing the most prestigious citizens of the city. In them, polychrome mosaic pavements of great proportions can be found, such as that of the House of Orpheus, a &quot;domus&quot; of big proportions whose hall had a surface area of 47 m2; or that of the Triumph of Bacchus that appeared next to an important sculptural group: the Ena Group (two nymphs performing music, reflecting exquisite taste, delicate chiseling and a philhellenistic taste introduced in the Empire under the Antonines), preserved in the Marés museum in Barcelona; previous dating, however, it was attributed these mosaics and sculptures to the 2nd century.

There is also a proliferation of agrarian villas in the process of ruralization experienced by Roman culture in its final period, and the great differences that begin to appear between &quot;honestiores&quot; (or wealthy) and &quot;humiliores&quot; (of humble social status) citizens.

The western road or the Toledo gate, had been generating in its margins a neighborhood of pottery workshops, since the industries of the city had to settle outside the urban area to be generators of pollution and waste.

The necropolis of the city had been located outside the city walls, on the sides of the great access and exit roads of the city. In the 3rd century, at least three important necropolises are documented, one on each of the roads corresponding to the east or Toledo exits (San Pablo neighborhood, San Blas and Dosset streets), west (Las Fuentes necropolis, Nuestra Señora del Pueyo street) and north (next to the Ebro, Paseo de Echegaray y Caballero).

In the middle of the 4th century, a Christian cemetery was built around a place of worship in the chapel of Las Santas Masas, a religion whose presence in Zaragoza dates back to the middle of the 3rd century, as attested by a letter from Bishop Cyprian, head of the Christian Church in Carthage.

== Late Antiquity (284-408 A.D.) ==
After reaching power, Diocletian (284-305) reformed the State and the Roman political system, which had suffered a prolonged crisis that threatened the unity of the Empire since the time of Marcus Aurelius (161-180), facilitating the barbarian incursions. Diocletian distributed the responsibilities of government among the tetrarchs, of which Maximian and Constantius corresponded to the West, leaving Hispania, Africa and Italy, and thus Caesaraugusta, in the hands of Maximian. The city remained from that moment to the margin of the maneuvers of Diocletian to recover the power and, to its death, the government of Hispania passed to the following emperors. In the absence of direct information, it is to suppose that the city continued being demilitarized, falling the defense of the walls in case of attack on the local &quot;militia&quot; and especially on the &quot;collegia iuvenum&quot;, a body formed by the sons of the upper classes. The peasants close to the city took refuge inside the walls; those farther away had to rely on small troops stationed in watchtowers regularly distributed along the roads for their defense. Large landowners could have their own private army, made up of slaves and serfs.

Within the administrative reforms initiated by Diocletian, the &quot;Hispania Citerior&quot; was divided in three: &quot;Gallaecia&quot;, &quot;Tarraconensis&quot; and &quot;Carthaginensis&quot;, with &quot;praeses perfectissimus&quot;, all part of the &quot;Diocesis Hispaniarum&quot;, with capital in Merida. Caesaraugusta continued to belong to the province of &quot;Tarraconensis&quot;, governed by a &quot;praeses&quot; with headquarters in Tarragona, with the disappearance of the old Caesaraugustan convent.

Usually, the 4th century is analyzed from the point of view of the decline of the Empire: the fiscal pressure on the &quot;curiales&quot;, the fleeing of the founding aristocracy to their rural estates and the economic crisis would have caused the decline or ruin of the late Roman cities. In the case of Caesaraugusta, archaeology has revealed the decadence of the thermal complex of San Juan and San Pedro in the mid-4th century. The baths suffered a spoliation of noble materials and such a radical abandonment that the remains of an adolescent were found on the floor of the &quot;frigidarium&quot;. Other signs of the difficulties of the mid-4th century are the abandonment of a domus at 6 Torrenueva Street, showing traces of fire in the mosaic, indicating a bad use of the dwelling, the destruction of the domestic baths at Ossaú Street and the definitive abandonment of the theater, which must not have been unaffected by the spread of Christianity, since it did not look favorably on this pagan spectacle.

However, the decadence does not seem to have been important in the case of Zaragoza. Archaeology shows the existence of large luxurious houses, an import of exclusive products from Rome and the south of France and an active trade with North Africa. The main source of the 4th century, Paulinus of Nola, whose wife Therasia had possessions in Zaragoza, Tarragona and Barcelona, recounts that he himself dwells in Caesaraugusta, among other localities, and praises its extensive territory and its walls. In 379 a synod was held in the city, an indication that it had the capacity to receive bishops and their entourages. In fact, towards the end of the 4th century, Zaragoza and Barcelona began to increase their importance compared to Tarragona. There are reports of circus games in Caesaraugusta in the year 504, a sign that the curiales were still fulfilling their functions at that late date.

=== Low-Imperial Administration ===

Taking the North African city of Timgad as a model, it is possible to reconstruct approximately the local government: &quot;curia&quot; or senate, magistrates and &quot;populus&quot;. There were approximately one hundred &quot;curiales&quot;, of whom a minority were &quot;honorati&quot; exempt from &quot;munera&quot;, tax burdens, classified in descending order into &quot;clarissimi&quot;, of senatorial rank, the &quot;perfectissimi&quot;, from 326 different from the &quot;equites&quot;, and the &quot;sacerdotales&quot;, former priests. Below them were the &quot;decuriones&quot;, also belonging to the &quot;curia&quot;, local hereditary aristocrats from the 3rd century; the sons of a &quot;decurion&quot; acceded to the &quot;ordo&quot; upon emancipation at the age of 25, but were required to take a foundation census to guarantee the fulfillment of the financial burdens. The magistrates and decurions initially performed their services to the city on a voluntary basis, in return for the power and prestige of the office; but from Severan times this voluntary exercise was codified in the form of obligatory &quot;munera&quot;. Among the services rendered to the city, apart from the payment of the &quot;summa honoraria&quot; upon taking office, the officials had to organize games, maintain the public baths, supervise the bringing and evacuation of water, officially represent the city, control and supervise the conservation and construction of roads, bridges, aqueducts, public buildings and walls, and oversee the prices of the market, among other activities.

The head of the magistrates was the &quot;curator ciuitatis&quot; who was elected for one year among the &quot;curiales&quot; or from 363 by the citizen council with the other magistrates. The functions of the &quot;curator&quot; were to oversee the financial management, the registration of the &quot;acta&quot;, the execution of public works, the provisioning, the control of prices, in charge of the police and the instruction of some minor matters; the &quot;duouiri&quot;, the other magistrates, &quot;aediles&quot; and &quot;quaestors&quot;, were subordinate to them.

The &quot;territorium&quot; or rural territory that depended administratively on Caesaraugusta is unknown. It included the lands of the &quot;curiales&quot;, the rustic villas, the &quot;vici&quot; or dependent villages, the &quot;pagi&quot; or minor places and the communal lands. The leasing and exploitation of the latter went to the municipal treasury until the change of legislation, which transferred two thirds of the property to the imperial treasury. The extension can be assumed to be considerable, if one considers that there are no nearby cities of importance and the agglomeration of rustic villas in the surroundings of the city.

=== The arrival of Christianity ===

&quot;Eighteen martyrs are kept by our people in a single tomb; we call Zaragoza the city that has been able to hold such glory.&quot;

Prudentius, &quot;Peristephanon&quot;, translation by J. GuillénThe first news of Christianity in Caesaraugusta appears in a letter of Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, dated 254, in which he mentions Felix of Caesaraugusta, &quot;fidei cultor ac defensor veritatis&quot;.

But it was Prudentius who left the most extensive testimony in his &quot;carmen&quot; &quot;Peristephanon&quot; of the beginning of the 5th century. In it he speaks of the Innumerable Martyrs, in reality 18 —Optatus, Lupercus, Suceso, Martial, Urbanus, Quintilianus, Julia, Publius, Fronton, Felix, Caecilian, Eventius, Primitivus, Apodemus and four Saturnines—, besides Engratia, Valerius and Vincent and Gaius and Clement, the latter confessors who were not killed. The first, the martyrs of Saragossa, and Engracia seem to have died in the persecution of Valerian (200-260) in 257 and 258, although the data is not certain. Valerius, bishop of Saragossa, and Vincent, his deacon, were deported around 303-305 to Valencia by Maximian (250-310), where they were tortured, Vincent dying. Valerius, who still attended the council of Iliberis around 306, belonged to the &quot;domus infulata&quot; of the Valerians, a dynasty of Ceasaraugustan bishops named Valero/Valerius, which shows that Saragossa was already an episcopal see from the middle of the 3rd century. There are indications that Saint Engracia and the martyrs would have been buried in a small building dedicated to their cult, a &quot;Martyrium&quot;, to which a mosaic of the 4th century with Christian symbolism preserved in the Museum of Saragossa could belong.

In 311 Galerius (260-311) published the edict that officially legalized the Christian church and from 313, Christianity obtained a privileged position in front of the traditional religion. This allowed the realization of a series of councils, like the already mentioned of Iliberis, in which the church purified and eliminated a series of heresies. Rufinus and Clementius were sent to the Council of Arles in 314. In 343, Casto, bishop of Saragossa, was summoned to Serdica (present-day Sofia, Bulgaria) to combat Arianism. Councils were also held in Saragossa, the first in 380 dedicated to the fight against Priscillianism.

From between 330 and 350 A.D. two early Christian &quot;sarcophagi&quot; have been preserved, which are kept in the basilica church of Santa Engracia. They possibly come from a necropolis that was located in the area of Santa Engracia and the Plaza de los Sitios related to the &quot;Martyrium&quot; mentioned above. Both are of marble sculpted in Rome and brought by ship, indicating the existence of Christians with sufficient resources. The first, named the &quot;Assumption&quot; or the &quot;receptio animae&quot;, shows various biblical scenes, such as the creation of Adam and Eve, the healing of the hemorrhoid, the prayer between two apostles, the &quot;receptio animae&quot;, the healing of the blind man, the wedding at Cana and the Original Sin. The second sarcophagus, usually called the Petrine trilogy, shows the miracle of the fountain, the arrest of Peter, the scene of the rooster, the healing of the blind man, the conversion of water into wine, the multiplication of the loaves and fishes and the resurrection of Lazarus.

In addition to the aforementioned basilica-church of Santa Engracia, which was located in the same place as the present building, it is possible that there were two other basilicas-churches in the city. The first, that of Santa María, on the site where the Basílica del Pilar is now located; the second, that of San Millán, on the grounds of the old Roman theater. There has also been speculation about the existence of a third basilica-church in the western necropolis, identifying it as that of San Felix. The remains of the temple of the forum have been found under the cathedral of La Seo, which indicates a continuity of worship from Roman times, passing through the major mosque of Saraqusta and the modern Christian cathedral, although no archaeological evidence has been found of the existence of a Roman or Visigothic Christian temple on the site.

In 380 Theodosius (346-395), with the edict of Thessalonica, named Christianity the official and only religion of the Empire.

== The fall of the Empire (408-472 A.D.) ==

The internal crisis of the Empire was compounded by the fact that in the winter of 405-406 the Rhine froze and the Germanic peoples crossed the river on foot: the Suebi, Vandals and Alans set out to conquer and plunder the lands of Gaul. In the autumn of 409 they entered Hispania.

The Germanic invasion coincided with the uprising of Constantine in 407, then commander of Britannia, against the emperor of the West, Flavius Honorius. Constantine established his capital at Arles in Gaul, sending his son, Caesar Constans, and his general Gerontius to conquer Lusitania, still loyal to Honorius, son of Theodosius I. On his return, Constantius passed through Caesaraugusta, leaving there his wife, Gerontius and most of his army. Gerontius decided to revolt against Constantine and Constans, making a pact with Alans, Suebi and Vandals for the division of the Peninsula and launching himself into the pursuit of Constans, whom he caught up with and killed. The fact indicates that the city was important enough both to be considered safe by Constans, and with the necessary resources to be the base of an uprising by Gerontius. Honorius reacted in 411, defeating both Constantine and Gerontius, but only managed to reconquer &quot;Tarraconensis&quot;, leaving the rest of Hispania in the hands of the Germanic tribes.

Archaeology shows that during the 5th century the public places of the city were abandoned. The &quot;forum&quot; was abandoned and the ashlars of the theater were reused in the construction of dwellings. These dwellings were often built precisely in these abandoned public spaces, which can be explained as an attempt to accommodate within the wall the rural populations fleeing the prevailing instability.

Caesaragusta was spared from the attacks of the Bagaudas between 441 and 454 thanks to its powerful walls. The problem was so important that Turiasu was assaulted, caught and massacred, even the bishop Leon died. To solve the problem, Theodoric II, king of the Visigoths, still under Roman obedience, sent his brother Frederic in command of an army.

The &quot;Caesaraugustan Chronicle&quot; records the last visit of a Roman emperor in 460. Emperor Majorian (457-461) stopped in Caesaragusta on his way to North Africa, which had fallen into the hands of the Asdingian Vandals. The fact is curious if it is considered that the logical way to go to Cartagena would have been by the coast, but perhaps the military importance of the city made him deviate.

In 472 the city was definitively conquered by a Visigoth army led by Count Gauterico, in the name of King Euric. Only four years later, in 476, Odoacer, leader of the Heruli, deposed the last Roman emperor of the West, which is usually considered as the end of the Western Roman Empire and the beginning of the Middle Ages.

<text>Soyuz 10 (, &quot;Union 10&quot;) was launched on 22 April 1971 as the world&#x27;s first mission to the world&#x27;s first space station, the Soviet Salyut 1. The docking was not successful and the crew, Vladimir Shatalov, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Nikolai Rukavishnikov, returned to Earth without having entered the station. Following difficulties in docking pairs of Soyuz capsules, this would be the first of numerous docking failures in the Soviet space station program.

== Spacecraft ==
The spacecraft was the first of the upgraded Soyuz 7K-OKS, featuring the new &quot;probe and drogue&quot; docking mechanism with internal crew transfer capability, intended for space station visits.

== Mission ==
The cosmonauts Vladimir Shatalov, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Nikolai Rukavishnikov were able to navigate their Soyuz 10 spacecraft to the Salyut 1 station, yet during docking they ran into problems. The automatic control system failed during approach, owing to a serious design oversight. Soft dock (contact between the spacecraft and station without a full link) was achieved on 24 April 1971 at 01:47 GMT, but the computer sensed an abnormality in the spacecraft&#x27;s alignment and began firing the attitude control jets to compensate. With Soyuz 10 being pushed to one side by the attitude control system, it became impossible to achieve hard dock, and large quantities of propellant were expended doing so. The docking attempt was called off, but further difficulty occurred when the probe would not come out of the space station&#x27;s docking cone. The obvious solution was simply to jettison the orbital module and leave it attached to Salyut 1, but this would make it impossible for future Soyuz missions to dock; thus, the space station would have to be abandoned. Eventually, ground controllers realised that the cosmonauts could throw a circuit breaker in the docking mechanism, for interrupting the power supply, which would cause the probe to automatically retract. This procedure worked, and undocking was completed and the capsule returned to Earth later on 24 April 1971 at 23:40 GMT. The automatic control system would be redesigned on future Soyuz spacecraft.

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
=== Reserve crew ===
== Mission parameters ==
* Mass: 
* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 51.6°
* Period: 89.0 minutes

== Return ==
Retrorockets were fired at the first opportunity after undocking to permit return to Earth. One last hitch presented itself when toxic fumes began to fill the capsule during reentry, causing Rukavishnikov to pass out; however, all three crew members were recovered unscathed. The landing at 120 km to the northeast of Karaganda, Kazakhstan, the first night-time landing of a crewed spacecraft, was a success.

<text>Nikolai Nikolayevich Rukavishnikov (; 18 September 1932 – 19 October 2002) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew three space missions of the Soyuz programme: Soyuz 10, Soyuz 16, and Soyuz 33. Two of these missions, Soyuz 10 and Soyuz 33, were intended to dock with Salyut space stations, but failed to do so.

==Biography==

Rukavishnikov studied at the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute and after graduation worked for Sergey Korolev&#x27;s design bureau. He was selected for cosmonaut training in 1967.

Rukavishnikov became the 50th human to fly in space on 23 April 1971, the launch date of Soyuz 10. The mission, along with Vladimir Shatalov and Aleksei Yeliseyev, was intended to dock with the Salyut 1 space station. They were unable to dock, and returned to Earth two days later.

He began his second flight, Soyuz 16, on 2 December 1974, with Anatoly Filipchenko. The mission was a test of the Soyuz 7K-TM hardware being used in the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project. The mission lasted six days, and was a complete success.

His third flight, Soyuz 33, was an Intercosmos flight to the Salyut 6 space station on 10 April 1979 with Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov. On its final approach, the spacecraft&#x27;s main engine failed, and the docking was aborted. They were able to return to Earth with the backup engine, but an overly-long re-entry burn led to a 10-&quot;g&quot; ballistic re-entry. The crew was recovered safely.

Rukavishnikov resigned from the space programme in 1987, and returned to work for the same bureau he started with, by then known as Energia.

He died of a heart attack on 19 October 2002.

He was awarded:
*Twice Hero of the Soviet Union
*Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR
*Four Orders of Lenin
*Hero of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic
*Hero of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria
*Order of Sukhbaatar (People&#x27;s Republic of Mongolia)
*Order of Georgi Dimitrov (People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria)

<text>Malcolm McDowell (born Malcolm John Taylor; 13 June 1943) is an English actor. He first became known for portraying Mick Travis in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;if...&quot; (1968), a role he later reprised in &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973) and &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982). His performance in &quot;if...&quot; prompted Stanley Kubrick to cast him as Alex in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), the role for which McDowell became best known.

McDowell&#x27;s other notable film credits include &quot;The Raging Moon&quot; (1971), &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979), &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979), &quot;Cat People&quot; (1982), &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983), &quot;The Caller&quot; (1987), &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), &quot;Tank Girl&quot; (1995), &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; (1997), &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot; (2003), &quot;The Company&quot; (2003), &quot;Evilenko&quot; (2004), &quot;The Artist&quot; (2011), and &quot;Bombshell&quot; (2019). He also played Dr. Samuel Loomis in the 2007 remake of &quot;Halloween&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Halloween II&quot; (2009).

On television, McDowell appeared as Dornford Yates&#x27;s gentleman hero Richard Chandos in the 1978 BBC adaptation of &quot;She Fell Among Thieves&quot;. He had recurring roles on &quot;Entourage&quot; (2005–2011) and &quot;Heroes&quot; (2006–2007), starring roles on &quot;Franklin &amp; Bash&quot; (2011–2014) and &quot;Mozart in the Jungle&quot; (2014–2018), and has played Patrick &quot;Pop&quot; Critch on the Canadian series &quot;Son of a Critch&quot; since 2022. He has also voiced characters in various animated shows, films and video games, including Metallo on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, Vater Orlaag in &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, Dr. Calico in &quot;Bolt&quot;, President Eden in &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, Molag Bal in &quot;The Elder Scrolls Online&quot;, and Dr. Monty in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops III.&quot;

McDowell is the recipient of an Evening Standard British Film Award, alongside nominations for Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
McDowell was born Malcolm John Taylor on 13 June 1943 in Horsforth, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of hotelier Edna (née McDowell) and RAF officer (and later pub owner) Charles Taylor. He has an older sister named Gloria and a younger sister named Judy. Gloria later had a son, actor Alexander Siddig, alongside whom McDowell would appear in the film &quot;Doomsday&quot; (2008). The family moved to Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, where McDowell&#x27;s father was stationed at the nearby RAF Carnaby. They then moved to Liverpool, where McDowell grew up and as a teenager took a job in a Planters nut factory in nearby Aintree, as well as working at his father&#x27;s pub, The Bull and Dog, in Burscough, Lancashire. He began taking acting classes while in school, later moving to London in order to train as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA).

==Career==
===Acting===

McDowell initially secured work as an extra with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He made his film debut as school rebel Mick Travis in &quot;if...&quot; (1968) by British director Lindsay Anderson. A landmark of British countercultural cinema, the BFI named &quot;if...&quot; the 12th greatest British film of the 20th century. McDowell&#x27;s next roles were in &quot;Figures in a Landscape&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Raging Moon&quot; (1971). His performance in &quot;if...&quot; caught the attention of Stanley Kubrick, who cast McDowell for the lead in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), adapted from the novel by Anthony Burgess. He gained massive acclaim for his performance as Alex DeLarge, a young, antisocial hoodlum who undergoes brainwashing by the British government in a near future society. He was nominated for a Golden Globe, a National Society of Film Critics Award, and a New York Film Critics Circle Award as Best Actor.

He worked with Anderson again for &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973, also wrote), which was inspired by McDowell&#x27;s experience working as a coffee salesman, and &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982). McDowell regularly appeared on British television productions in the 1970s in adaptations of theatre classics, one example being with Laurence Olivier in &quot;The Collection&quot; (1976), as part of the series &quot;Laurence Olivier Presents&quot;. He starred in &quot;Aces High&quot; (1976) and co-starred in &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), and as Dornford Yates&#x27; gentleman hero Richard Chandos in &quot;She Fell Among Thieves&quot; (1978) and the title character in &quot;Caligula&quot; (1979). He made his Hollywood debut as H. G. Wells in &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979). He has often portrayed antagonists, later remarking on his career playing film villains: &quot;I suppose I&#x27;m primarily known for that but in fact, that would only be half of my career if I was to top it all up&quot;. In his biography &quot;Anthony Burgess: A Life&quot;, author Roger Lewis commented on McDowell&#x27;s later career: &quot;his pretty-boy looks faded and he was condemned to playing villains in straight-to-video films that turn up on Channel 5&quot;.

McDowell appeared in the action film &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983) as F.E. Cochrane, and the horror remake &quot;Cat People&quot; (1982). In 1983, he starred in &quot;Get Crazy&quot; as Reggie Wanker, a parody of Mick Jagger. Also in 1983, McDowell starred as the Wolf (Reginald von Lupen) in &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;″s rendition of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot; (his wife at that time, Mary Steenburgen, played Little Red Riding Hood). In 1984, he narrated the documentary &quot;The Compleat Beatles&quot;. He is known in &quot;Star Trek&quot; circles as &quot;the man who killed Captain Kirk&quot;, appearing in the film &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994) in which he played the mad scientist Dr. Tolian Soran, and several overzealous &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans even issued death threats for this. McDowell appeared in several computer games, most notably as Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn in the &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series of computer games. His appearance in &quot;Wing Commander III&quot; marked the series transition from 2D pre-rendered cutscenes to live-action cutscenes. His appearance in &quot;Wing Commander IV&quot; was during the final days of video game live action cutscenes.
In 1995, he co-starred with actress and artist Lori Petty in the science fiction/action comedy film &quot;Tank Girl&quot;. Here, he played the villain Dr. Kesslee, the evil director of the global Water and Power Company, whose main goal in the story was to control the planet&#x27;s entire water supply on a future desert-like, post-apocalyptic Earth.

McDowell appeared in a 2000 episode of the animated series &quot;South Park&quot;, which was a comedic retelling of the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. In the episode, McDowell played the real-life narrator of the story in live action, introducing himself simply as &quot;a British person&quot;, in a parody of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, and its ex-host, Alistair Cooke.

McDowell played himself in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot;, in which he chastises protagonist Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) for badmouthing him behind his back. He worked with Altman once again for &quot;The Company&quot; (2003) as &quot;Mr. A.&quot;, the fictional director of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago. His character was based on real-life director Gerald Arpino. McDowell had a brief but memorable role as the psychopathic Gangster in the British crime film &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot; (2000). In the film &quot;I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead&quot; (2003), he played a straight married man who rapes a young drug dealer to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot;. The film also starred Clive Owen as the victim&#x27;s elder brother.
In 2006, McDowell portrayed radio mogul Jonas Slaughter on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;. The following year, he portrayed the villainous Mr. Linderman on the first season of the NBC series &quot;Heroes&quot;, a role he reprised in the third-season premiere. He starred in &quot;Jerry Was a Man&quot;, which appeared as an episode of &quot;Masters of Science Fiction&quot; on Sky. He portrayed Terrence McQuewick on &quot;Entourage&quot;, and he made a special guest appearance as the icy fashion designer Julian Hodge in the &quot;Monk&quot; season 4 episode, &quot;Mr. Monk Goes to a Fashion Show&quot;. &quot;Never Apologize&quot; is a 2007 documentary film of Malcolm McDowell&#x27;s one-man show about his experiences working with film director Lindsay Anderson.

McDowell appeared as Dr. Samuel Loomis in Rob Zombie&#x27;s remakes of &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Halloween II&quot; (in 2007 and 2009, respectively). Although the films were not well received critically, they performed better at the box office and McDowell was widely praised. He also played Desmond LaRochette in Robert Whitlow&#x27;s &quot;The List&quot; (2007), and Irish patriarch Enda Doyle in &quot;Red Roses and Petrol&quot; (2003). His next film was the Canadian vampire comedy rock and roll film &quot;Suck&quot; (2009) with actor/director Rob Stefaniuk and the Alex Wright film &quot;Two Wolves&quot;. In December 2009, he made an appearance in the music video &quot;Snuff&quot; by the heavy metal band Slipknot. He appears, uncredited, as the curator Lombardi, in the film &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010). McDowell portrayed Satan in the Christian comedy thriller film &quot;Suing the Devil&quot; (2011).

<text>Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the dynamic &quot;evolution&quot; of the system. In the most common version, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined by numerically solving Newton&#x27;s equations of motion for a system of interacting particles, where forces between the particles and their potential energies are often calculated using interatomic potentials or molecular mechanical force fields. The method is applied mostly in chemical physics, materials science, and biophysics.

Because molecular systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to determine the properties of such complex systems analytically; MD simulation circumvents this problem by using numerical methods. However, long MD simulations are mathematically ill-conditioned, generating cumulative errors in numerical integration that can be minimized with proper selection of algorithms and parameters, but not eliminated.

For systems that obey the ergodic hypothesis, the evolution of one molecular dynamics simulation may be used to determine the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of the system: the time averages of an ergodic system correspond to microcanonical ensemble averages. MD has also been termed &quot;statistical mechanics by numbers&quot; and &quot;Laplace&#x27;s vision of Newtonian mechanics&quot; of predicting the future by animating nature&#x27;s forces and allowing insight into molecular motion on an atomic scale.

== History ==
MD was originally developed in the early 1950s, following earlier successes with Monte Carlo simulationswhich themselves date back to the eighteenth century, in the Buffon&#x27;s needle problem for examplebut was popularized for statistical mechanics at Los Alamos National Laboratory by Marshall Rosenbluth and Nicholas Metropolis in what is known today as the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. Interest in the time evolution of N-body systems dates much earlier to the seventeenth century, beginning with Isaac Newton, and continued into the following century largely with a focus on celestial mechanics and issues such as the stability of the solar system. Many of the numerical methods used today were developed during this time period, which predates the use of computers; for example, the most common integration algorithm used today, the Verlet integration algorithm, was used as early as 1791 by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre. Numerical calculations with these algorithms can be considered to be MD done &quot;by hand&quot;.

As early as 1941, integration of the many-body equations of motion was carried out with analog computers. Some undertook the labor-intensive work of modeling atomic motion by constructing physical models, e.g., using macroscopic spheres. The aim was to arrange them in such a way as to replicate the structure of a liquid and use this to examine its behavior. J.D. Bernal describes this process in 1962, writing:... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place as casually as possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption.Following the discovery of microscopic particles and the development of computers, interest expanded beyond the proving ground of gravitational systems to the statistical properties of matter. In an attempt to understand the origin of irreversibility, Enrico Fermi proposed in 1953, and published in 1955, the use of the early computer MANIAC I, also at Los Alamos National Laboratory, to solve the time evolution of the equations of motion for a many-body system subject to several choices of force laws. Today, this seminal work is known as the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem. The time evolution of the energy from the original work is shown in the figure to the right.
In 1957, Berni Alder and Thomas Wainwright used an IBM 704 computer to simulate perfectly elastic collisions between hard spheres. In 1960, in perhaps the first realistic simulation of matter, J.B. Gibson &quot;et al&quot;. simulated radiation damage of solid copper by using a Born–Mayer type of repulsive interaction along with a cohesive surface force. In 1964, Aneesur Rahman published simulations of liquid argon that used a Lennard-Jones potential; calculations of system properties, such as the coefficient of self-diffusion, compared well with experimental data. Today, the Lennard-Jones potential is still one of the most frequently used intermolecular potentials. It is used for describing simple substances (a.k.a. Lennard-Jonesium) for conceptual and model studies and as a building block in many force fields of real substances.

== Areas of application and limits ==

First used in theoretical physics, the molecular dynamics method gained popularity in materials science soon afterward, and since the 1970s it has also been commonly used in biochemistry and biophysics. MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of proteins and other macromolecules based on experimental constraints from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. In physics, MD is used to examine the dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion subplantation, and to examine the physical properties of nanotechnological devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and structural biology, the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in ligand docking. In principle, MD can be used for &quot;ab initio&quot; prediction of protein structure by simulating folding of the polypeptide chain from a random coil.

The results of MD simulations can be tested through comparison to experiments that measure molecular dynamics, of which a popular method is NMR spectroscopy. MD-derived structure predictions can be tested through community-wide experiments in Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP), although the method has historically had limited success in this area. Michael Levitt, who shared the Nobel Prize partly for the application of MD to proteins, wrote in 1999 that CASP participants usually did not use the method due to &quot;... a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure&quot;. Improvements in computational resources permitting more and longer MD trajectories, combined with modern improvements in the quality of force field parameters, have yielded some improvements in both structure prediction and homology model refinement, without reaching the point of practical utility in these areas; many identify force field parameters as a key area for further development.

MD simulation has been reported for pharmacophore development and drug design. For example, Pinto &quot;et al&quot;. implemented MD simulations of Bcl-xL complexes to calculate average positions of critical amino acids involved in ligand binding. Carlson &quot;et al&quot;. implemented molecular dynamics simulations to identify compounds that complement a receptor while causing minimal disruption to the conformation and flexibility of the active site. Snapshots of the protein at constant time intervals during the simulation were overlaid to identify conserved binding regions (conserved in at least three out of eleven frames) for pharmacophore development. Spyrakis &quot;et al&quot;. relied on a workflow of MD simulations, fingerprints for ligands and proteins (FLAP) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to identify the best ligand-protein conformations to act as pharmacophore templates based on retrospective ROC analysis of the resulting pharmacophores. In an attempt to ameliorate structure-based drug discovery modeling, &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the need for many modeled compounds, Hatmal &quot;et al&quot;. proposed a combination of MD simulation and ligand-receptor intermolecular contacts analysis to discern critical intermolecular contacts (binding interactions) from redundant ones in a single ligand–protein complex. Critical contacts can then be converted into pharmacophore models that can be used for virtual screening.

An important factor is intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which are not explicitly included in modern force fields, but described as Coulomb interactions of atomic point charges. This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially quantum mechanical and chemical nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the dielectric constant of a vacuum, even though the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Thus, using the macroscopic dielectric constant at short interatomic distances is questionable. Finally, van der Waals interactions in MD are usually described by Lennard-Jones potentials based on the Fritz London theory that is only applicable in a vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on dielectric properties of the environment. The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as Hamaker constant) shows that &quot;the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum&quot;. The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.

== Design constraints ==

The design of a molecular dynamics simulation should account for the available computational power. Simulation size (&quot;n&quot; = number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be long enough to be relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the kinetics of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one footstep. Most scientific publications about the dynamics of proteins and DNA use data from simulations spanning nanoseconds (10−9 s) to microseconds (10−6 s). To obtain these simulations, several CPU-days to CPU-years are needed. Parallel algorithms allow the load to be distributed among CPUs; an example is the spatial or force decomposition algorithm.

During a classical MD simulation, the most CPU intensive task is the evaluation of the potential as a function of the particles&#x27; internal coordinates. Within that energy evaluation, the most expensive one is the non-bonded or non-covalent part. In big O notation, common molecular dynamics simulations scale by formula_1 if all pair-wise electrostatic and van der Waals interactions must be accounted for explicitly. This computational cost can be reduced by employing electrostatics methods such as particle mesh Ewald summation ( formula_2 ), particle-particle-particle mesh (P3M), or good spherical cutoff methods ( formula_3 ). 

Another factor that impacts total CPU time needed by a simulation is the size of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid discretization errors (i.e., smaller than the period related to fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are on the order of 1 femtosecond (10−15 s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE constraint algorithm, which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.

For simulating molecules in a solvent, a choice should be made between an explicit and implicit solvent. Explicit solvent particles (such as the TIP3P, SPC/E and SPC-f water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce chemical kinetics.

In all kinds of molecular dynamics simulations, the simulation box size must be large enough to avoid boundary condition artifacts. Boundary conditions are often treated by choosing fixed values at the edges (which may cause artifacts), or by employing periodic boundary conditions in which one side of the simulation loops back to the opposite side, mimicking a bulk phase (which may cause artifacts too).

=== Microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ===

In the microcanonical ensemble, the system is isolated from changes in moles (N), volume (V), and energy (E). It corresponds to an adiabatic process with no heat exchange. A microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory may be seen as an exchange of potential and kinetic energy, with total energy being conserved. For a system of &quot;N&quot; particles with coordinates formula_4 and velocities formula_5, the following pair of first order differential equations may be written in Newton&#x27;s notation as

:formula_6
:formula_7

The potential energy function formula_8 of the system is a function of the particle coordinates formula_4. It is referred to simply as the &quot;potential&quot; in physics, or the &quot;force field&quot; in chemistry. The first equation comes from Newton&#x27;s laws of motion; the force formula_10 acting on each particle in the system can be calculated as the negative gradient of formula_8.

For every time step, each particle&#x27;s position formula_4 and velocity formula_5 may be integrated with a symplectic integrator method such as Verlet integration. The time evolution of formula_4 and formula_5 is called a trajectory. Given the initial positions (e.g., from theoretical knowledge) and velocities (e.g., randomized Gaussian), we can calculate all future (or past) positions and velocities.

One frequent source of confusion is the meaning of temperature in MD. Commonly we have experience with macroscopic temperatures, which involve a huge number of particles, but temperature is a statistical quantity. If there is a large enough number of atoms, statistical temperature can be estimated from the &quot;instantaneous temperature&quot;, which is found by equating the kinetic energy of the system to &quot;nkBT&quot;/2, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

A temperature-related phenomenon arises due to the small number of atoms that are used in MD simulations. For example, consider simulating the growth of a copper film starting with a substrate containing 500 atoms and a deposition energy of 100 eV. In the real world, the 100 eV from the deposited atom would rapidly be transported through and shared among a large number of atoms (formula_16 or more) with no big change in temperature. When there are only 500 atoms, however, the substrate is almost immediately vaporized by the deposition. Something similar happens in biophysical simulations. The temperature of the system in NVE is naturally raised when macromolecules such as proteins undergo exothermic conformational changes and binding.

=== Canonical ensemble (NVT) ===

In the canonical ensemble, amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of endothermic and exothermic processes is exchanged with a thermostat.

A variety of thermostat algorithms are available to add and remove energy from the boundaries of an MD simulation in a more or less realistic way, approximating the canonical ensemble. Popular methods to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the Nosé–Hoover thermostat, Nosé–Hoover chains, the Berendsen thermostat, the Andersen thermostat and Langevin dynamics. The Berendsen thermostat might introduce the flying ice cube effect, which leads to unphysical translations and rotations of the simulated system.

It is not trivial to obtain a canonical ensemble distribution of conformations and velocities using these algorithms. How this depends on system size, thermostat choice, thermostat parameters, time step and integrator is the subject of many articles in the field.

=== Isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble ===

In the isothermal–isobaric ensemble, amount of substance (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) are conserved. In addition to a thermostat, a barostat is needed. It corresponds most closely to laboratory conditions with a flask open to ambient temperature and pressure.

In the simulation of biological membranes, isotropic pressure control is not appropriate. For lipid bilayers, pressure control occurs under constant membrane area (NPAT) or constant surface tension &quot;gamma&quot; (NPγT).

=== Generalized ensembles ===

The replica exchange method is a generalized ensemble. It was originally created to deal with the slow dynamics of disordered spin systems. It is also called parallel tempering. The replica exchange MD (REMD) formulation tries to overcome the multiple-minima problem by exchanging the temperature of non-interacting replicas of the system running at several temperatures.

== Potentials in MD simulations ==

A molecular dynamics simulation requires the definition of a potential function, or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a force field and in materials physics as an interatomic potential. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on molecular mechanics and embody a classical mechanics treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and conformational changes but usually cannot reproduce chemical reactions.

The reduction from a fully quantum description to a classical potential entails two main approximations. The first one is the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which states that the dynamics of electrons are so fast that they can be considered to react instantaneously to the motion of their nuclei. As a consequence, they may be treated separately. The second one treats the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, as point particles that follow classical Newtonian dynamics. In classical molecular dynamics, the effect of the electrons is approximated as one potential energy surface, usually representing the ground state.

When finer levels of detail are needed, potentials based on quantum mechanics are used; some methods attempt to create hybrid classical/quantum potentials where the bulk of the system is treated classically but a small region is treated as a quantum system, usually undergoing a chemical transformation.

=== Empirical potentials ===

Empirical potentials used in chemistry are frequently called force fields, while those used in materials physics are called interatomic potentials.

Most force fields in chemistry are empirical and consist of a summation of bonded forces associated with chemical bonds, bond angles, and bond dihedrals, and non-bonded forces associated with van der Waals forces and electrostatic charge. Empirical potentials represent quantum-mechanical effects in a limited way through ad hoc functional approximations. These potentials contain free parameters such as atomic charge, van der Waals parameters reflecting estimates of atomic radius, and equilibrium bond length, angle, and dihedral; these are obtained by fitting against detailed electronic calculations (quantum chemical simulations) or experimental physical properties such as elastic constants, lattice parameters and spectroscopic measurements.

Because of the non-local nature of non-bonded interactions, they involve at least weak interactions between all particles in the system. Its calculation is normally the bottleneck in the speed of MD simulations. To lower the computational cost, force fields employ numerical approximations such as shifted cutoff radii, reaction field algorithms, particle mesh Ewald summation, or the newer particle–particle-particle–mesh (P3M).

Chemistry force fields commonly employ preset bonding arrangements (an exception being &quot;ab initio&quot; dynamics), and thus are unable to model the process of chemical bond breaking and reactions explicitly. On the other hand, many of the potentials used in physics, such as those based on the bond order formalism can describe several different coordinations of a system and bond breaking. Examples of such potentials include the Brenner potential for hydrocarbons and its
further developments for the C-Si-H and C-O-H systems. The ReaxFF potential can be considered a fully reactive hybrid between bond order potentials and chemistry force fields.

=== Pair potentials versus many-body potentials ===

The potential functions representing the non-bonded energy are formulated as a sum over interactions between the particles of the system. The simplest choice, employed in many popular force fields, is the &quot;pair potential&quot;, in which the total potential energy can be calculated from the sum of energy contributions between pairs of atoms. Therefore, these force fields are also called &quot;additive force fields&quot;. An example of such a pair potential is the non-bonded Lennard-Jones potential (also termed the 6–12 potential), used for calculating van der Waals forces.

:formula_17

Another example is the Born (ionic) model of the ionic lattice. The first term in the next equation is Coulomb&#x27;s law for a pair of ions, the second term is the short-range repulsion explained by Pauli&#x27;s exclusion principle and the final term is the dispersion interaction term. Usually, a simulation only includes the dipolar term, although sometimes the quadrupolar term is also included. When &quot;nl&quot; = 6, this potential is also called the Coulomb–Buckingham potential.

:formula_18

In many-body potentials, the potential energy includes the effects of three or more particles interacting with each other. In simulations with pairwise potentials, global interactions in the system also exist, but they occur only through pairwise terms. In many-body potentials, the potential energy cannot be found by a sum over pairs of atoms, as these interactions are calculated explicitly as a combination of higher-order terms. In the statistical view, the dependency between the variables cannot in general be expressed using only pairwise products of the degrees of freedom. For example, the Tersoff potential, which was originally used to simulate carbon, silicon, and germanium, and has since been used for a wide range of other materials, involves a sum over groups of three atoms, with the angles between the atoms being an important factor in the potential. Other examples are the embedded-atom method (EAM), the EDIP, and the Tight-Binding Second Moment Approximation (TBSMA) potentials, where the electron density of states in the region of an atom is calculated from a sum of contributions from surrounding atoms, and the potential energy contribution is then a function of this sum.

=== Semi-empirical potentials ===

Semi-empirical potentials make use of the matrix representation from quantum mechanics. However, the values of the matrix elements are found through empirical formulae that estimate the degree of overlap of specific atomic orbitals. The matrix is then diagonalized to determine the occupancy of the different atomic orbitals, and empirical formulae are used once again to determine the energy contributions of the orbitals.

There are a wide variety of semi-empirical potentials, termed tight-binding potentials, which vary according to the atoms being modeled.

=== Polarizable potentials ===
Most classical force fields implicitly include the effect of polarizability, e.g., by scaling up the partial charges obtained from quantum chemical calculations. These partial charges are stationary with respect to the mass of the atom. But molecular dynamics simulations can explicitly model polarizability with the introduction of induced dipoles through different methods, such as Drude particles or fluctuating charges. This allows for a dynamic redistribution of charge between atoms which responds to the local chemical environment.

For many years, polarizable MD simulations have been touted as the next generation. For homogenous liquids such as water, increased accuracy has been achieved through the inclusion of polarizability. Some promising results have also been achieved for proteins. However, it is still uncertain how to best approximate polarizability in a simulation. The point becomes more important when a particle experiences different environments during its simulation trajectory, e.g. translocation of a drug through a cell membrane.

=== Potentials in &quot;ab initio&quot; methods ===
In classical molecular dynamics, one potential energy surface (usually the ground state) is represented in the force field. This is a consequence of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles using a quantum mechanical method, such as density functional theory. This is named &quot;Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics&quot; (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational burden of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular dynamics. For this reason, AIMD is typically limited to smaller systems and shorter times.

&quot;Ab initio&quot; quantum mechanical and chemical methods may be used to calculate the potential energy of a system on the fly, as needed for conformations in a trajectory. This calculation is usually made in the close neighborhood of the reaction coordinate. Although various approximations may be used, these are based on theoretical considerations, not on empirical fitting. &quot;Ab initio&quot; calculations produce a vast amount of information that is not available from empirical methods, such as density of electronic states or other electronic properties. A significant advantage of using &quot;ab initio&quot; methods is the ability to study reactions that involve breaking or formation of covalent bonds, which correspond to multiple electronic states. Moreover, &quot;ab initio&quot; methods also allow recovering effects beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation using approaches like mixed quantum-classical dynamics.

=== Hybrid QM/MM ===

QM (quantum-mechanical) methods are very powerful. However, they are computationally expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained are not very accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the chemical environment). A new class of method has emerged that combines the good points of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations. These methods are termed mixed or hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanics methods (hybrid QM/MM).

The most important advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. The cost of doing classical molecular dynamics (MM) in the most straightforward case scales O(n2), where n is the number of atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts with every other particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald&#x27;s (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n2). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest &quot;ab initio&quot; calculations typically scale O(n3) or worse (restricted Hartree–Fock calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n2.7)). To overcome the limit, a small part of the system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.

In more sophisticated implementations, QM/MM methods exist to treat both light nuclei susceptible to quantum effects (such as hydrogens) and electronic states. This allows generating hydrogen wave-functions (similar to electronic wave-functions). This methodology has been useful in investigating phenomena such as hydrogen tunneling. One example where QM/MM methods have provided new discoveries is the calculation of hydride transfer in the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase. In this case, quantum tunneling is important for the hydrogen, as it determines the reaction rate.

=== Coarse-graining and reduced representations ===

At the other end of the detail scale are coarse-grained and lattice models. Instead of explicitly representing every atom of the system, one uses &quot;pseudo-atoms&quot; to represent groups of atoms. MD simulations on very large systems may require such large computer resources that they cannot easily be studied by traditional all-atom methods. Similarly, simulations of processes on long timescales (beyond about 1 microsecond) are prohibitively expensive, because they require so many time steps. In these cases, one can sometimes tackle the problem by using reduced representations, which are also called coarse-grained models.

Examples for coarse graining (CG) methods are discontinuous molecular dynamics (CG-DMD) and Go-models. Coarse-graining is done sometimes taking larger pseudo-atoms. Such united atom approximations have been used in MD simulations of biological membranes. Implementation of such approach on systems where electrical properties are of interest can be challenging owing to the difficulty of using a proper charge distribution on the pseudo-atoms. The aliphatic tails of lipids are represented by a few pseudo-atoms by gathering 2 to 4 methylene groups into each pseudo-atom.

The parameterization of these very coarse-grained models must be done empirically, by matching the behavior of the model to appropriate experimental data or all-atom simulations. Ideally, these parameters should account for both enthalpic and entropic contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy of the dynamic description may be less reliable. But very coarse-grained models have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.

Examples of applications of coarse-graining:
* protein folding and protein structure prediction studies are often carried out using one, or a few, pseudo-atoms per amino acid;
* liquid crystal phase transitions have been examined in confined geometries and/or during flow using the Gay-Berne potential, which describes anisotropic species;
* Polymer glasses during deformation have been studied using simple harmonic or FENE springs to connect spheres described by the Lennard-Jones potential;
* DNA supercoiling has been investigated using 1–3 pseudo-atoms per basepair, and at even lower resolution;
* Packaging of double-helical DNA into bacteriophage has been investigated with models where one pseudo-atom represents one turn (about 10 basepairs) of the double helix;
* RNA structure in the ribosome and other large systems has been modeled with one pseudo-atom per nucleotide.

The simplest form of coarse-graining is the &quot;united atom&quot; (sometimes called &quot;extended atom&quot;) and was used in most early MD simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH3 methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH2 methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups have the proper distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that have the capability to participate in hydrogen bonds (&quot;polar hydrogens&quot;). An example of this is the CHARMM 19 force-field.

The polar hydrogens are usually retained in the model, because proper treatment of hydrogen bonds requires a reasonably accurate description of the directionality and the electrostatic interactions between the donor and acceptor groups. A hydroxyl group, for example, can be both a hydrogen bond donor, and a hydrogen bond acceptor, and it would be impossible to treat this with one OH pseudo-atom. About half the atoms in a protein or nucleic acid are non-polar hydrogens, so the use of united atoms can provide a substantial savings in computer time.

=== Machine Learning Force Fields ===
Machine Learning Force Fields] (MLFFs) represent one approach to modeling interatomic interactions in molecular dynamics simulations. MLFFs can achieve accuracy close to that of ab initio methods. Once trained, MLFFs are much faster than direct quantum mechanical calculations. MLFFs address the limitations of traditional force fields by learning complex potential energy surfaces directly from high-level quantum mechanical data. Several software packages now support MLFFs, including VASP and open-source libraries like DeePMD-kit and SchNetPack.

== Incorporating solvent effects ==
In many simulations of a solute-solvent system the main focus is on the behavior of the solute with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the solute molecule. Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a frictional drag on the motion of the solute through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the solute. It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a potential mean force (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.

Without incorporating the effects of solvent simulations of macromolecules (such as proteins) may yield unrealistic behavior and even small molecules may adopt more compact conformations due to favourable van der Waals forces and electrostatic interactions which would be dampened in the presence of a solvent.

== Long-range forces ==
A long range interaction is an interaction in which the spatial interaction falls off no faster than formula_19 where formula_20 is the dimensionality of the system. Examples include charge-charge interactions between ions and dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Modelling these forces presents quite a challenge as they are significant over a distance which may be larger than half the box length with simulations of many thousands of particles. Though one solution would be to significantly increase the size of the box length, this brute force approach is less than ideal as the simulation would become computationally very expensive. Spherically truncating the potential is also out of the question as unrealistic behaviour may be observed when the distance is close to the cut off distance.

== Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) ==

Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, or force probe simulations, apply forces to a protein in order to manipulate its structure by pulling it along desired degrees of freedom. These experiments can be used to reveal structural changes in a protein at the atomic level. SMD is often used to simulate events such as mechanical unfolding or stretching.

There are two typical protocols of SMD: one in which pulling velocity is held constant, and one in which applied force is constant. Typically, part of the studied system (e.g., an atom in a protein) is restrained by a harmonic potential. Forces are then applied to specific atoms at either a constant velocity or a constant force. Umbrella sampling is used to move the system along the desired reaction coordinate by varying, for example, the forces, distances, and angles manipulated in the simulation. Through umbrella sampling, all of the system&#x27;s configurations—both high-energy and low-energy—are adequately sampled. Then, each configuration&#x27;s change in free energy can be calculated as the potential of mean force. A popular method of computing PMF is through the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), which analyzes a series of umbrella sampling simulations.

A lot of important applications of SMD are in the field of drug discovery and biomolecular sciences. For e.g. SMD was used to investigate the stability of Alzheimer&#x27;s protofibrils, to study the protein ligand interaction in cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and even to show the effect of electric field on thrombin (protein) and aptamer (nucleotide) complex among many other interesting studies.

== Examples of applications ==

Molecular dynamics is used in many fields of science.
* First MD simulation of a simplified biological folding process was published in 1975. Its simulation published in Nature paved the way for the vast area of modern computational protein-folding.
* First MD simulation of a biological process was published in 1976. Its simulation published in Nature paved the way for understanding protein motion as essential in function and not just accessory.
* MD is the standard method to treat collision cascades in the heat spike regime, i.e., the effects that energetic neutron and ion irradiation have on solids and solid surfaces.

The following biophysical examples illustrate notable efforts to produce simulations of a systems of very large size (a complete virus) or very long simulation times (up to 1.112 milliseconds):
* MD simulation of the full &quot;satellite tobacco mosaic virus&quot; (STMV) (2006, Size: 1 million atoms, Simulation time: 50 ns, program: NAMD) This virus is a small, icosahedral plant virus that worsens the symptoms of infection by Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Molecular dynamics simulations were used to probe the mechanisms of viral assembly. The entire STMV particle consists of 60 identical copies of one protein that make up the viral capsid (coating), and a 1063 nucleotide single stranded RNA genome. One key finding is that the capsid is very unstable when there is no RNA inside. The simulation would take one 2006 desktop computer around 35 years to complete. It was thus done in many processors in parallel with continuous communication between them.
* Folding simulations of the Villin Headpiece in all-atom detail (2006, Size: 20,000 atoms; Simulation time: 500 μs= 500,000 ns, Program: Folding@home) This simulation was run in 200,000 CPU&#x27;s of participating personal computers around the world. These computers had the Folding@home program installed, a large-scale distributed computing effort coordinated by Vijay Pande at Stanford University. The kinetic properties of the Villin Headpiece protein were probed by using many independent, short trajectories run by CPU&#x27;s without continuous real-time communication. One method employed was the Pfold value analysis, which measures the probability of folding before unfolding of a specific starting conformation. Pfold gives information about transition state structures and an ordering of conformations along the folding pathway. Each trajectory in a Pfold calculation can be relatively short, but many independent trajectories are needed.
* Long continuous-trajectory simulations have been performed on Anton, a massively parallel supercomputer designed and built around custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and interconnects by D. E. Shaw Research. The longest published result of a simulation performed using Anton is a 1.112-millisecond simulation of NTL9 at 355 K; a second, independent 1.073-millisecond simulation of this configuration was also performed (and many other simulations of over 250 μs continuous chemical time). In &quot;How Fast-Folding Proteins Fold&quot;, researchers Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Stefano Piana, Ron O. Dror, and David E. Shaw discuss &quot;the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 μs and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins.&quot; Examination of these diverse long trajectories, enabled by specialized, custom hardware, allow them to conclude that &quot;In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.&quot; In a separate study, Anton was used to conduct a 1.013-millisecond simulation of the native-state dynamics of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) at 300 K.

Another important application of MD method benefits from its ability of 3-dimensional characterization and analysis of microstructural evolution at atomic scale.
* MD simulations are used in characterization of grain size evolution, for example, when describing wear and friction of nanocrystalline Al and Al(Zr) materials. Dislocations evolution and grain size evolution are analyzed during the friction process in this simulation. Since MD method provided the full information of the microstructure, the grain size evolution was calculated in 3D using the Polyhedral Template Matching, Grain Segmentation, and Graph clustering methods. In such simulation, MD method provided an accurate measurement of grain size. Making use of these information, the actual grain structures were extracted, measured, and presented. Compared to the traditional method of using SEM with a single 2-dimensional slice of the material, MD provides a 3-dimensional and accurate way to characterize the microstructural evolution at atomic scale.

<text>Aosdána ( , ; from , &#x27;people of the arts&#x27;) is an Irish association or academy of artists, each of whom must have produced a distinguished body of work of genuine originality. It was created in 1981 by the country&#x27;s Arts Council on the initiative of a group of writers with support from the Taoiseach. Membership, which is by invitation from current members, is limited to 250 individuals; before 2005 it was limited to 200. Its steering body is a committee of 10, called the Toscaireacht.

==Formation==
Aosdána was originally set up by the Arts Council, on the suggestion of writer Anthony Cronin, with support from the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, well known for his support for the Arts, although Fintan O&#x27;Toole has argued that this also served to deflect criticism of Haughey&#x27;s political actions. The first 89 members were chosen by the Arts Council.

==Membership==

The process of induction relies entirely on members proposing new members, with a system of selective voting used to filter applications. Applications by artists themselves are not allowed.

===Stipend (Cnuas)===
Some members of Aosdána resident in Ireland receive a stipend, called the &quot;Cnuas&quot; (, ; a gift of financial aid put aside for the purpose of support), from the Arts Council of Ireland. This stipend is intended to allow recipients to work full-time at their art. The value of the Cnuas in 2021 was €20,180 (about £17,000 or US$23,000), having been around €17,000 for some years before that.

The poet Pearse Hutchinson, a member of Aosdána, described it as &quot;a miracle and a godsend&quot; that allowed him to continue writing at a time when he might have had to give up. Composer Roger Doyle has also spoken about the difference it made: &quot;I was elected to Aosdána in 1986. This gave me a small stipend from the Government each year, which enabled me to devote all my time to composing. This changed my life for the better and I have composed non-stop since then.&quot;

===Honour - Saoi===

The title of Saoi (lit. &quot;wise one&quot;) is a national honour that members of Aosdána can bestow upon a fellow member. No more than seven living members (previously five) can be so honoured at one time. The honour is conferred by the President of Ireland in a ceremony during which a gold torc is placed around the neck of the recipient by the President.

, the current living Saoithe were:
* George Morrison, film-maker 
* Roger Doyle, composer
* Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, poet

Among the deceased holders of the title of Saoi are the Nobel Laureates Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney, dramatists Brian Friel and Tom Murphy, and the artists Patrick Scott, Louis le Brocquy, Edna O&#x27;Brien, and Camille Souter.

==Governance==
===Toscaireacht and Assembly===
The &quot;Toscaireacht&quot; (&quot;delegation&quot;) is a committee of ten members, called Toscairí, of the Aosdána. It meets several times a year to deal with the administration and external relations of Aosdána, reports to every General Assembly, which meets once a year, and sets the assembly&#x27;s agenda. When new members of Aosdána are proposed, the Toscairí have the task of verifying that the nomination process has been complied with, and also that the candidate is willing to accept membership, before the next stage of election is begun.

===Elections===
Toscairí are elected to the Toscaireacht by the members of Aosdána for two years at a time. All members of Aosdána are eligible for election, and nominations must be made in writing by three members. The electoral process is in two stages. First, within each of Aosdána&#x27;s three disciplines (Music, Literature, and Visual Arts), the two nominees with the highest number of votes are elected: this guarantees a minimum of two Toscairí from each of the disciplines. Next, the remaining four places are filled by the remaining nominees from any discipline who have the highest number of votes.

===Meetings===
The procedure at meetings is laid down in the Toscaireacht&#x27;s Standing Orders. Minutes of its meetings appear on Aosdána&#x27;s website.

===Current Toscairí===
, the Toscaireacht members are:
*Eamon Colman (Visual Arts)
*Theo Dorgan (Literature)
*Anne Haverty (Literature)
*Michael Holohan (Music)
*Anne Tallentire (Visual Arts)
*Grainne Mulvey (Music)
*Vivienne Dick (Visual Arts)
*Cathy Carman (Visual Arts)
*Gerard Smyth (Literature)
*Enda Wyley (Literature)

<doc id="198616" wikidata="Q360106" url="?curid=198616" title="David Sarnoff">
<text>David Sarnoff (February 27, 1891 – December 12, 1971) was a Russian and American businessman who played an important role in the American history of radio and television. He led RCA for most of his career in various capacities from shortly after its founding in 1919 until his retirement in 1970.

He headed a conglomerate of telecommunications and media companies, including RCA and NBC, that became one of the largest in the world. Named a Reserve Brigadier General of the Signal Corps in 1945, Sarnoff thereafter was widely known as &quot;The General&quot;.

==Early life and career==
David Sarnoff was born to a Jewish family in Uzlyany, a small town in Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire (today part of Belarus), the son of Abraham Sarnoff and Leah Privin. Abraham emigrated to the United States and raised funds to bring the family. Sarnoff spent much of his early childhood in a cheder (or yeshiva) studying and memorizing the Torah. He emigrated with his mother and three brothers and one sister to New York City in 1900, where he helped support his family by selling newspapers before and after his classes at the Educational Alliance. In 1906 his father became incapacitated by tuberculosis, and at age 15 Sarnoff went to work to support the family. He had planned to pursue a full-time career in the newspaper business, but a chance encounter led to a position as an office boy at the Commercial Cable Company. When his superior refused him leave for Rosh Hashanah, he joined the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America on September 30, 1906, and started a career of over in electronic communications.

Over the next , Sarnoff rose from office boy to commercial manager of the company, learning about the technology and the business of electronic communications on the job and in libraries. He also served at Marconi stations on ships and posts on Siasconset, Nantucket and the New York Wanamaker Department Store. In 1911, he installed and operated the wireless equipment on a ship hunting seals off Newfoundland and Labrador, and used the technology to relay the first remote medical diagnosis from the ship&#x27;s doctor to a radio operator at Belle Isle with an infected tooth.

The following year, he led two other operators at the Wanamaker station in an effort to confirm the fate of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Sarnoff later exaggerated his role as the sole hero who stayed by his telegraph key for three days to receive information on the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s survivors. Schwartz questions whether Sarnoff, who was a manager of the telegraphers by the time of the disaster, was working the key although that brushes aside concerns about corporate hierarchy. The event began on a Sunday when the store would have been closed.

Over the next two years Sarnoff earned promotions to chief inspector and contracts manager for a company whose revenues swelled after Congress passed legislation mandating continuous staffing of commercial shipboard radio stations. That same year Marconi won a patent suit that gave it the coastal stations of the United Wireless Telegraph Company. Sarnoff also demonstrated the first use of radio on a railroad line, the Lackawanna Railroad Company&#x27;s link between Binghamton, New York, and Scranton, Pennsylvania; and permitted and observed Edwin Armstrong&#x27;s demonstration of his regenerative receiver at the Marconi station at Belmar, New Jersey. Sarnoff used H. J. Round&#x27;s hydrogen arc transmitter to demonstrate the broadcast of music from the New York Wanamaker station.

This demonstration and the AT&amp;T demonstrations in 1915 of long-distance wireless telephony inspired the first of many memos to his superiors on applications of current and future radio technologies. Sometime late in 1915 or in 1916 he proposed to the company&#x27;s president, Edward J. Nally, that the company develop a &quot;radio music box&quot; for the &quot;amateur&quot; market of radio enthusiasts. Nally deferred on the proposal because of the expanded volume of business during World War I. Throughout the war years, Sarnoff remained Marconi&#x27;s Commercial Manager, including oversight of the company&#x27;s factory in Roselle Park, New Jersey.

==Business career==
===RCA===
Unlike many who were involved with early radio communications, who often viewed radio as point-to-point, Sarnoff saw the potential of radio as point-to-mass. One person (the broadcaster) could speak to many (the listeners).

When Owen D. Young of General Electric arranged the purchase of American Marconi and reorganized it as the Radio Corporation of America, a radio patent monopoly, Sarnoff realized his dream and revived his proposal in a lengthy memo on the company&#x27;s business and prospects. His superiors again ignored him but he contributed to the rising postwar radio boom by helping arrange for the broadcast of a heavyweight boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier in July, 1921. Up to 300,000 people listened to the broadcast of the fight, and demand for home radio equipment bloomed that winter. By the spring of 1922, Sarnoff&#x27;s prediction of popular demand for radio broadcasting had come to pass and over the next few years, he gained much stature and influence.

In 1925, RCA purchased its first radio station (WEAF, New York) and launched the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the first radio network in America. Four years later, Sarnoff became president of RCA. NBC had by that time split into two networks, the Red and the Blue. The Blue Network eventually became ABC Radio. Sarnoff is often inaccurately referred to as the founder of both RCA and NBC, but he was in fact founder of only NBC.

Sarnoff was instrumental in building and establishing the AM broadcasting radio business that became the preeminent public radio standard for the majority of the 20th century.

===RKO===
Sarnoff negotiated successful contracts to form Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), a film production and distribution company. Essential elements in that new company were RCA, the Film Booking Offices of America (FBO), and the Keith-Albee-Orpheum (KAO) theater chain.

===Early history of television===

When Sarnoff was put in charge of radio broadcasting at RCA, he soon recognized the potential for television, i.e., the combination of motion pictures with electronic transmission. Schemes for television had long been proposed (well before World War I) but with no practical outcome. Sarnoff was determined to lead his company in pioneering the medium and met with Westinghouse engineer Vladimir Zworykin in 1928. At the time Zworykin was attempting to develop an all-electronic television system at Westinghouse, but with little success. Zworykin had visited the laboratory of the inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, who had developed an Image Dissector, part of a system that could enable a working television. Zworykin was sufficiently impressed with Farnsworth&#x27;s invention that he had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation.

Zworykin pitched the concept to Sarnoff, claiming a viable television system could be realized in two years with a mere $100,000 investment. Sarnoff opted to fund Zworkyin&#x27;s research, most likely well-aware that Zworykin was underestimating the scope of his television effort. Seven years later, in late 1935, Zworykin&#x27;s photograph appeared on the cover of the trade journal &quot;Electronics&quot;, holding an early RCA photomultiplier prototype. The photomultiplier, subject of intensive research at RCA and in Leningrad, Russia, would become an essential component within sensitive television cameras. On April 24, 1936, RCA demonstrated to the press a working iconoscope camera tube and kinescope receiver display tube (an early cathode-ray tube), two key components of all-electronic television.

The final cost of the enterprise was closer to $50 million. On the road to success they encountered a legal battle with Farnsworth, who had been granted patents in 1930 for his solution to broadcasting moving pictures. Despite Sarnoff&#x27;s efforts to prove that he was the inventor of the television, he was ordered to pay Farnsworth $1,000,000 in royalties, a small price to settle the dispute for an invention that would profoundly revolutionize the world. However this sum was never paid to Farnsworth.

In 1929, Sarnoff engineered the purchase of the Victor Talking Machine Company, the nation&#x27;s largest manufacturer of records and phonographs, merging radio-phonograph production at Victor&#x27;s large manufacturing facility in Camden, New Jersey.

Sarnoff became president of RCA on January 3, 1930, succeeding General James Harbord. On May 30 the company was involved in an antitrust case concerning the original radio patent pool. Sarnoff negotiated an outcome where RCA was no longer partly owned by Westinghouse and General Electric, giving him final say in the company&#x27;s affairs.

Initially, the Great Depression caused RCA to cut costs, but Zworykin&#x27;s project was protected. After nine years of Zworykin&#x27;s hard work, Sarnoff&#x27;s determination, and legal battles with Farnsworth (in which Farnsworth was proved in the right), they had a commercial system ready to launch. Finally, in April 1939, regularly scheduled, electronic television in America was initiated by RCA under the name of their broadcasting division at the time, The National Broadcasting Company (NBC). The first television broadcast aired was the dedication of the RCA pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fairgrounds and was introduced by Sarnoff himself. Later that month on April 30, opening day ceremonies at The World&#x27;s Fair were telecast in the medium&#x27;s first major production, featuring a speech by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the first US president to appear on television. These telecasts were seen only in New York City and the immediate vicinity, since NBC television had only one station at the time, W2XBS Channel 1, now WNBC Channel 4. The broadcast was seen by an estimated 1,000 viewers from the roughly 200 television sets which existed in the New York City area at the time.

The standard approved by the National Television System Committee (the NTSC) in 1941 differed from RCA&#x27;s standard, but RCA quickly became the market leader of manufactured sets and NBC became the first television network in the United States, connecting their New York City station to stations in Philadelphia and Schenectady for occasional programs in the early 1940s.

Meanwhile, a system developed by EMI based on Russian research and Zworykin&#x27;s work was adopted in Britain and the BBC had a regular television service from 1936 onwards. However, World War II put a halt to a dynamic growth of the early television development stages.

===World War II===
At the onset of World War II, Sarnoff served on Eisenhower&#x27;s communications staff, arranging expanded radio circuits for NBC to transmit news from the invasion of France in June 1944. In France, Sarnoff arranged for the restoration of the Radio France station in Paris that the Germans destroyed and oversaw the construction of a radio transmitter powerful enough to reach all of the allied forces in Europe, called Radio Free Europe. In recognition of his achievements, Sarnoff was decorated with the Legion of Merit on October 11, 1944.

Thanks to his communications skills and support he received the Brigadier General&#x27;s star in December 1945, and thereafter was known as &quot;General Sarnoff.&quot; The star, which he proudly and frequently wore, was buried with him.

Sarnoff anticipated that post-war America would need an international radio voice explaining its policies and positions. In 1943, he tried to influence Secretary of State Cordell Hull to include radio broadcasting in post-war planning. In 1947, he lobbied Secretary of State George Marshall to expand the roles of Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. His concerns and proposed solutions were eventually seen as prescient.

===Post-war expansion===
After the war, monochrome TV production began in earnest. Color TV was the next major development, and NBC once again won the battle. CBS had their electro-mechanical color television system approved by the FCC on October 10, 1950, but Sarnoff filed an unsuccessful suit in the United States district court to suspend that ruling. Subsequently, he made an appeal to the Supreme Court which eventually upheld the FCC decision. Sarnoff&#x27;s tenacity and determination to win the &quot;Color War&quot; pushed his engineers to perfect an all-electronic color television system that used a signal that could be received on existing monochrome sets that prevailed. CBS was now unable to take advantage of the color market, due to lack of manufacturing capability and color programming, a system that could not be seen on the millions of black and white receivers and sets that were triple the cost of monochrome sets. A few days after CBS had its color premiere on June 14, 1951, RCA demonstrated a fully functional all-electronic color TV system and became the leading manufacturer of color TV sets in the US.

CBS system color TV production was suspended in October 1951 for the duration of the Korean War. As more people bought monochrome sets, it was increasingly unlikely that CBS could achieve any success with its incompatible system. Few receivers were sold, and there were almost no color broadcasts, especially in prime time, when CBS could not run the risk of broadcasting a program which few could see. The NTSC was reformed and recommended a system virtually identical to RCA&#x27;s in August 1952. On December 17, 1953, the FCC approved RCA&#x27;s system as the new standard.

===Later years===

In 1955, Sarnoff received The Hundred Year Association of New York&#x27;s Gold Medal Award &quot;in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.&quot;

In 1959 Sarnoff was a member of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund panel to report on U.S. foreign policy. As a member of that panel and in a subsequent essay published in &quot;Life&quot; as part of its &quot;The National Purpose&quot; series, he was critical of the tentative stand being taken by the United States in fighting the political and psychological warfare being waged by Soviet-led international Communism against the West. He strongly advocated an aggressive, multi-faceted fight in the ideological and political realms with a determination to decisively win the Cold War.

Sarnoff retired in 1970, at the age of 79, and died the following year, aged 80. He is interred in a mausoleum featuring a stained-glass vacuum tube in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York.

After his death, Sarnoff left behind an estate estimated to be worth over $1 million. The majority of the estate went to his widow, Lizette Hermant Sarnoff, who received $300,000, personal and household effects in addition to the Sarnoff home, located on 44 East 71st Street.

==Family life==
On July 4, 1917, Sarnoff married Lizette Hermant, the daughter of a French-Jewish immigrant family who settled in the Bronx as one of his family&#x27;s neighbors. The Museum of Broadcast Communications describes their 54-year marriage as the bedrock of his life. Lizette was often the first person to hear her husband&#x27;s new ideas as radio and television became integral to American home life.

The couple had three sons. Eldest son Robert W. Sarnoff (1918–1997) succeeded his father at the helm of RCA in 1970. Robert&#x27;s third wife was operatic soprano Anna Moffo. Edward Sarnoff, the middle child, headed Fleet Services of New York. Thomas W. Sarnoff, the youngest, was NBC&#x27;s West Coast President.

Sarnoff was the maternal uncle of screenwriter Richard Baer. Sarnoff was credited with sparking Baer&#x27;s interest in television. According to Baer&#x27;s 2005 autobiography, Sarnoff called a vice president at NBC at 6 A.M. and ordered him to find Baer &quot;a job by 9 o&#x27;clock&quot; that same morning. The NBC vice president complied with Sarnoff&#x27;s request.

David Sarnoff was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the Renovation Lodge No. 97, Albion, NY.

==Sarnoff museum==
The David Sarnoff Library, a library and museum open to the public containing many historical items from David Sarnoff&#x27;s life was in Princeton Junction, NJ. The David Sarnoff Library now exists as a virtual museum online. When the Library was operating, The David Sarnoff Radio Club composed of local amateur radio operators used to meet there, as did the New Jersey Antique Radio Club and other community organizations. The exhibits are now on display in Roscoe L. West Hall at The College of New Jersey.

==Sarnoff&#x27;s Law==
In 1999, computer scientist David P. Reed coined Sarnoff&#x27;s Law, which states that &quot;the value of a network grows in proportion to the number of viewers.&quot; Sarnoff&#x27;s Law, Metcalfe&#x27;s Law and Reed&#x27;s Law are frequently used in tandem in discussions of the value of networks.

<doc id="198618" wikidata="Q1931354" url="?curid=198618" title="Orgone">
<text>Orgone ( ) is a pseudoscientific concept variously described as an esoteric energy or hypothetical universal life force. Originally proposed in the 1930s by Wilhelm Reich, and developed by Reich&#x27;s student Charles Kelley after Reich&#x27;s death in 1957, orgone was conceived as the anti-entropic principle of the universe, a creative substratum in all of nature comparable to Mesmer&#x27;s animal magnetism (1779), to the Odic force (1845) of Carl Reichenbach and to Henri Bergson&#x27;s &quot;élan vital&quot; (1907). Orgone was seen as a massless, omnipresent substance, similar to luminiferous aether, but more closely associated with living energy than with inert matter. It could allegedly coalesce to create organization on all scales, from the smallest microscopic units—called &quot;bions&quot; in orgone theory—to macroscopic structures like organisms, clouds, or even galaxies.

Reich argued that deficits or constrictions in bodily orgone were at the root of many diseases, most prominently cancer, much as deficits or constrictions in the libido could produce neuroses in Freudian theory. Reich founded the Orgone Institute ca. 1942
to pursue research into orgone energy after he immigrated to the US in 1939; he used it to publish literature and distribute material relating to the topic for over a decade. Reich designed special &quot;orgone energy accumulators&quot;—devices ostensibly collecting orgone energy from the environment—to enable the study of orgone energy and to be applied medically to improve general health and vitality. Ultimately, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) obtained a federal injunction barring the interstate distribution of orgone-related materials because Reich and his associates were making false and misleading claims. A judge later ruled to jail Reich and ordered the banning and destruction of all orgone-related materials at the institute after an associate of Reich violated the injunction. Reich denied the assertion that orgone accumulators could improve sexual health by providing orgastic potency.

The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health lists orgone as a type of &quot;putative energy&quot;. After Reich&#x27;s death, research into the concept of orgone passed to some of his students, such as Kelley, and later to a new generation of scientists in Germany keen to discover an empirical basis for the orgone hypothesis (the first positive results of which were provided in 1989 by Stefan Muschenich).
There is no empirical support for the concept of orgone in medicine or the physical sciences, and research into the concept concluded with the end of the institute. Founded in 1982, the Institute for Orgonomic Science in New York is dedicated to the continuation of Reich&#x27;s work; it both publishes a digital journal on it and collects corresponding works.

==History==

The concept of orgone belongs to Reich&#x27;s later work after he immigrated to the US. Reich&#x27;s early work was based on the Freudian concept of the libido, though influenced by sociological understandings with which Freud disagreed but which were to some degree followed by other prominent theorists such as Herbert Marcuse and Carl Jung. While Freud had focused on a solipsistic conception of mind in which unconscious and inherently selfish primal drives (primarily the sexual drive, or libido) were suppressed or sublimated by internal representations (cathexes) of parental figures (the superego), for Reich libido was a life-affirming force repressed by society directly. For example, in one of his better-known analyses, Reich observes a workers&#x27; political rally, noting that participants were careful not to violate signs that prohibited walking on the grass; Reich saw this as the state co-opting unconscious responses to parental authority as a means of controlling behavior. He was expelled from the Institute of Psycho-analysis because of these disagreements over the nature of the libido and his increasingly political stance. He was forced to leave Germany soon after Hitler came to power.

Reich took an increasingly bioenergetic view of libido, perhaps influenced by his tutor Paul Kammerer and another biologist, Otto Heinrich Warburg. In the early 20th century, when molecular biology was in its infancy, developmental biology in particular still presented mysteries that made the idea of a specific life energy respectable, as was articulated by theorists such as Hans Driesch. As a psycho-analyst, Reich aligned such theories with the Freudian libido, while as a materialist, he believed such a life force must be susceptible to physical experiments.

He wrote in his best-known book, &quot;The Function of the Orgasm&quot;: &quot;Between 1919 and 1921, I became familiar with Driesch&#x27;s &#x27;Philosophie des Organischen&#x27; and his &#x27;Ordnungslehre&#x27;… Driesch&#x27;s contention seemed incontestable to me. He argued that, in the sphere of the life function, the whole could be developed from a part, whereas a machine could not be made from a screw… However, I couldn&#x27;t quite accept the transcendentalism of the life principle. Seventeen years later I was able to resolve the contradiction on the basis of a formula pertaining to the function of energy. Driesch&#x27;s theory was always present in my mind when I thought about vitalism. The vague feeling I had about the irrational nature of his assumption turned out to be justified in the end. He landed among the spiritualists.&quot;

The concept of orgone resulted from this work in the psycho-physiology of libido. After Reich migrated to the US, he began to speculate about biological development and evolution and then branched into much broader speculations about the nature of the universe. This led him to the conception of &quot;bions,&quot; self-luminescent sub-cellular vesicles that he believed were observable in decaying materials and presumably present universally. Initially, he thought of bions as electrodynamic or radioactive entities, as had the Russian biologist Alexander Gurwitsch, but later concluded that he had discovered an entirely unknown but measurable force, which he then named &quot;orgone&quot;, a pseudo-Greek formation probably from &quot;org-&quot; &quot;impulse, excitement&quot; as in &quot;org-asm&quot;, plus &quot;-one&quot; as in &quot;ozone&quot; (the Greek neutral participle, virtually , &quot;gen&quot;.: ).

For Reich, neurosis became a physical manifestation he called &quot;body armor&quot;—deeply seated tensions and inhibitions in the physical body that were not separated from any mental effects that might be observed. He developed a therapeutic approach he called vegetotherapy that was aimed at opening and releasing this body armor so that free instinctive reflexes—which he considered a token of psychic well-being—could take over.

==Evaluation==
Orgone was closely associated with sexuality: Reich, following Freud, saw nascent sexuality as the primary energetic force of life. The term itself was chosen to share a root with the word &quot;orgasm&quot;, which both Reich and Freud took as a fundamental expression of psychological health. This focus on sexuality, while acceptable in the clinical perspective of Viennese psychoanalytic circles, scandalized the conservative American public even as it appealed to countercultural figures like William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac.

In some cases, Reich&#x27;s experimental techniques do not appear to have been very careful or include precautions to remove experimental bias. Reich was concerned with experimental verification from other scientists. Albert Einstein agreed to participate, but thought Reich&#x27;s research lacked scientific detachment and experimental rigor; and concluded that the effect was simply due to the temperature gradient inside the room. &quot;Through these experiments I regard the matter as completely solved,&quot; he wrote to Reich on 7 February 1941. Upon further correspondence from Reich, Einstein replied that he could not devote any additional time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes.

Orgone and its related concepts were quickly denounced in the post-World War II American press. Reich and his students were seen as a &quot;cult of sex and anarchy,&quot; at least in part because orgone was linked with the title of his book &quot;The Function of the Orgasm&quot;, and this led to numerous investigations as a communist and denunciation under a wide variety of other pretexts. The psychoanalytical community of the time saw his approach to healing diseases as quackery of the worst sort. In 1954, the US Food and Drug Administration obtained an injunction to prevent Reich from making medical claims relating to orgone, which prevented him from shipping &quot;orgone devices&quot; across state lines, among other stipulations. Reich resisted the order to cease interstate distribution of orgone and was jailed, and the FDA destroyed Reich&#x27;s books, research materials, and devices at his institute relating to orgone.

Some psychotherapists and psychologists practicing various kinds of body psychotherapy and somatic psychology have continued to use Reich&#x27;s proposed emotional-release methods and character-analysis ideas.

==Film influence==
Dušan Makavejev opened his 1971 satirical film &quot;W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism&quot; with documentary coverage of Reich and his development of orgone accumulators, combining this with other imagery and a fictional sub-plot in a collage mocking sexual and political authorities. Scenes include one of only &quot;ten or fifteen orgone boxes left in the country&quot; at that time.

<text>Class War is an anarchist group and newspaper established by Ian Bone and others in 1983 in the United Kingdom. An incarnation of Class War was briefly registered as a political party for the purposes of fighting the 2015 United Kingdom general election.

== Events ==
In the 1980s, Class War organised a number of &quot;Bash The Rich&quot; demonstrations, in which supporters were invited to march through and disrupt wealthier areas of London such as Kensington, and Henley-on-Thames, bearing banners and placards with slogans such as &quot;Behold your future executioners!&quot;

A third Bash the Rich event, scheduled to march through Hampstead, in 1985 was largely prevented by a heavy police presence and was acknowledged by Class War to have been a failure. This event was seen by many as a major setback for the group and many members left to form other groups or drifted away.

== 2010s onwards ==
In the 2010s, Ian Bone revived Class War as a political party. Their activities included a weekly protest about &quot;poor doors&quot; outside One Commercial Street in Aldgate, with Action East End and &quot;Freedom News&quot;. These protests ended in partial victory in November 2014. Group member Lisa McKenzie was found not guilty under joint enterprise for causing criminal damage.

In the 2015 United Kingdom general election, Class War stood seven candidates which received a total of 526 votes. The party was voluntarily deregistered with the electoral commission in July 2015.

<text>Yevgeny Olegovich Adamov (, born 28 April 1939) is a Soviet and Russian nuclear engineer and politician. He was the director of the N. A. Dollezhal Research and Development Institute of Power Engineering (NIKIET) from 1986 to 1998. He served as the Minister for Atomic Energy of Russia from 1998 to 2001, member of the Security Council of Russia from 1998 to 2000, and adviser to the Prime Minister of Russia from 2002 to 2004.

In 2008 he was sentenced to five and a half years in prison for abuse of office and fraud, which was reduced to four years of probation on appeal.

==Biography==
Yevgeny Adamov was born on 28 April 1939 in Moscow. After graduating in 1962 from the Moscow Aviation Institute with a major in mechanical engineering, he joined the I. V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy and worked there until 1986. From 1986 to 1998 Adamov directed NIKIET, a Russian state nuclear research and design institute.

In 2005 he was arrested in Bern, Switzerland, on fraud charges. The arrest was made at the request of the United States. The United States accused Adamov of diverting up to US$9 million which the United States Department of Energy gave Russia to help improve security at its nuclear facilities. Extradition requests were filed first by the United States and then by Russia, which has protested about the move by the United States. Adamov was finally extradited to Russia. The move was widely covered as a successful ploy by the Russian government to prevent Adamov from telling US authorities state secrets that he knew.

In 2008 Adamov was convicted in Russia of abuse of office and defrauding the Russian government of some $31 million in US aid funds intended for security upgrades for aging nuclear reactors.

On 20 February 2008 he was convicted of fraud and misuse of power by the Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow and sentenced to 5.5 years of imprisonment.

He was released from jail when his sentence was suspended by a higher-level court on 17 April 2008.

<text>Klein Bonaire (Dutch for &quot;Little Bonaire&quot;) is a small uninhabited islet off the west coast of the Caribbean island of Bonaire, and is part of the Dutch special municipality of Bonaire.

== Geography ==
The Klein Bonaire islet, which sits within the rough crescent formed by the main island, is and extremely flat, rising no more than two meters above the sea. The only structures on the island are some ruins of slave huts (small, single-room structures dating to the region&#x27;s period of slavery), and a small open shelter on the beach facing Bonaire. The island has no running water or sanitation facilities.

== History ==
In 1868, Klein Bonaire was sold to Angel Jeserun and remained in private hands until 1999. During this period the native trees were removed, resulting in a scrub growth across the island. The development of Klein Bonaire was attempted a few times prior to its establishment as a marine preserve, the last unsuccessful attempt being in 1995.

Concerned locals rallied to save Klein Bonaire and raise funds to do so and The Foundation for the Preservation of Klein Bonaire (FPKB) was born. Through efforts of the FPKB and other concerned parties, and with monies from the Department of the Interior and Kingdom Affairs of the Netherlands, the World Nature Fund of the Netherlands and FPKB, the island was successfully purchased in 1999 for 9 million Netherlands Antillean guilder (US$5 million). 

Klein Bonaire is now part of the Bonaire National Marine Park. Long-term plans include reintroduction of the native vegetation.

== Flora and Fauna ==
Klein Bonaire is permanently home to green (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) and hawksbill sea turtles (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;).
During the nesting season it is also home to loggerhead sea turtles (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;) and occasional flamingos.

&quot;Montastraea annularis&quot; was the most common coral seen during a recent 2011 survey.

===Birds===
Klein Bonaire has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of threatened or restricted-range bird species, including bare-eyed pigeons, least terns and Caribbean elaenias. It is also a breeding site for Wilson&#x27;s and snowy plovers.

== Tourism ==
The distance from the shore of Bonaire to the shore of Klein Bonaire is about at the nearest point. This span is frequently traversed by private and commercial boats and can be done by kayak with some difficulty. The primary attraction for visitors is scuba diving and snorkeling the pristine coral reef surrounding the islet. Numbered yellow painted rocks near the open shelter show where divers can cross low points on the reef, which is very close to the beach. When facing the water at the rocks the current runs from right to left.

<doc id="198627" wikidata="Q7688560" url="?curid=198627" title="Tatyana Sapunova">
<text>Tatyana Sapunova (b. ~1974) is a Russian biophysicist who was seriously injured by an act of anti-Semitic terrorism on 27 May 2002. She was subsequently awarded the Order of Courage on 21 June 2002 by President Vladimir Putin, to which she replied, &quot;The news was entirely surprising&quot;.

==Background==
Tatyana Sapunova&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a Yiddish-speaking Jewish doctor from Belarus, who was imprisoned in the 1930s, and then sent to fight in the war. He moved around the U.S.S.R. several times, going from Kyiv to the Ural Mountains, and then to Tomsk in Siberia. His daughter, Yelena (b. ~1947), married a Russian atheist, later saying that she had not felt her Jewishness for much of her life. Their daughter Tatyana was baptised as a Christian, and she grew up not identifying herself as a Jew or Jewish.

==The bomb attack==
On the morning of 27 May 2002, Sapunova was driving along a road about southwest of Moscow, with her 4-year-old daughter and 55-year-old mother Yelena as passengers, when she spotted a sign near the roadside bearing a slogan variously translated as &quot;Death to Yids&quot;, or &quot;Death to the Kikes&quot;. The sign had in fact been there for at least a day, but no-one had taken it down. Tatyana was greatly offended by it, stopped her car, and got out to take the sign down. However, it was booby-trapped, and when she pulled on the sign, it set off a bomb, resulting in severe wounds to her legs, hands, and face. She was left with burns and lost sight in one eye.

===Her treatment===
Sapunova was treated in a hospital in Russia, where she was visited by Rabbi Berel Lazar, one of Russia&#x27;s two chief rabbis, and the man for whom a Russian security source has claimed was the intended victim. Lazar arranged for her to be flown to Israel for further treatment, for which various Jewish organisations offered to provide money. In Israel, Sapunova received further treatment for burns and eye damage.

<doc id="198628" wikidata="Q6195639" url="?curid=198628" title="Jim Hightower">
<text>James Allen Hightower (born January 11, 1943) is an American syndicated columnist, progressive political activist, and author. 

From 1983 to 1991 he served as the elected commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture. 

He publishes a monthly newsletter that is notable for its in-depth investigative reporting, &quot;The Hightower Lowdown&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in Denison in Grayson County in north Texas, Hightower comes from a working-class background. He worked his way through college as assistant general manager of the Denton Chamber of Commerce and later landed a spot as a management trainee for the U.S. State Department. He received a Bachelor of Arts in government from the University of North Texas in Denton, where he served as student body president. He later did graduate work at Columbia University in New York City in international affairs.

In the late 1960s, he worked in Washington, D.C., as legislative aide to U.S. Senator Ralph Yarborough. In 1970, Hightower co-founded and worked at the Agribusiness Accountability Project in Washington, D.C., which resulted in two of his early books. After managing the presidential campaign of former Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma in 1976, he returned to Texas to become the editor of the magazine &quot;The Texas Observer&quot;. His first attempt at public office was an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and natural gas industries, rather than the railroads the name of the commission would seem to indicate.

In 1982, Hightower was elected Agriculture Commissioner, having unseated fellow Democrat Reagan V. Brown, who had ordered a quarantine of fruit coming into Texas from California. He served as agriculture commissioner until he was unseated in 1990 by the Democrat-turned-Republican Rick Perry, later the governor of Texas. His tenure was noted for fostering organic production, alternative crops, direct marketing by small farmers, and strong gross materials regulations. During that time, he also became a leading national spokesman for Democrats and endorsed Jesse Jackson for president in 1988. Three of Hightower&#x27;s aides at the Agriculture Commission, Mike Moeller, Pete McRae, and Billie Quicksall, were convicted on bribery charges related to procuring contributions to Hightower&#x27;s reelection campaign from seed dealers who were subject to the department&#x27;s oversight. While Hightower was not involved in the plot, it contributed to his defeat by Perry.

During the 1992 presidential election, he supported the candidacy of U.S. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. After Harkin left the race, Hightower supported Jerry Brown, and cast his superdelegate vote for Governor Bill Clinton at the 1992 Democratic National Convention.

Soon after Clinton was elected, Hightower became a critic of the president. He criticized Clinton for having accepted corporate soft money contributions, his support of NAFTA, his health care plan, and his refusal to crack down on &quot;corporate welfare&quot;, as well as what Hightower viewed as inadequate efforts at fighting unemployment and poverty.

In 2000, he joined with talk show host Phil Donahue and actress Susan Sarandon to co-chair the presidential campaign of Ralph Nader. He also appeared at Nader&#x27;s &quot;super-rallies&quot; and stumped across the country for him.

After the disputed outcome of the 2000 election, Hightower voiced the opinion that it was Vice President Al Gore himself, who lost his home state of Tennessee, and not Ralph Nader, who caused Gore&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Governor George W. Bush of Texas. Although he issued no endorsement of any candidate during the 2004 presidential primaries, he spoke and wrote approvingly of since defeated U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, calling him a &quot;clear populist with a lifelong history of unambiguous advocacy of populist principles.&quot; Once Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts won the nomination, Hightower endorsed him and urged fellow progressives to work for his election, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s a sack of cement, we&#x27;re going to carry him to victory.&quot; During this election, he also campaigned in support of the U.S. Senate bid of Doris &quot;Granny D&quot; Haddock, a friend and fellow activist who was running as a Democrat against incumbent Republican Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.

Since 1993, Hightower has produced &quot;Hightower Radio&quot;, a daily two-minute commentary carried by over 130 affiliates. He also hosted a weekend talk show on the American Broadcasting Company radio network and a weekday midday talk show on the United Broadcasting Network (later called America Radio Network). &quot;Hightower&#x27;s Chit &amp; Chat&quot; aired in thirty-eight markets around the United States. Floyd Domino was his music director and co-host. Susan DeMarco was also a co-host of the program and continues to work with him.
In recent years, Hightower has advocated for industrial hemp as a sustainable agricultural crop.

Hightower endorsed Bernie Sanders for president in 2016, actively campaigning for the Democratic candidate. In summer 2016, after Hillary Clinton won the party&#x27;s nomination, Sanders supporters formed the progressive group Our Revolution, and Hightower joined the board of directors. Despite the Democratic party losing both houses of Congress in the United States, Hightower talked of his optimism toward a greater progressive revolution after meeting with Sanders. Hightower cited the large number of progressive initiatives passed to counter the idea that Donald Trump and right-wing populism were supplanting progressive ideals. In addition to being on the national board of Our Revolution, Hightower has been working with Our Revolution Texas.

===Syndicated column===
Hightower writes a nationally syndicated column carried by seventy-five independent weekly newspapers and other publications through Creators Syndicate. He also writes for &quot;The Progressive Populist&quot;.

===&quot;The Hightower Lowdown&quot;===
Hightower writes a monthly newsletter, &quot;The Hightower Lowdown,&quot; which has more than 135,000 subscribers. The newsletter is notable for its in-depth investigative reporting and criticism of George W. Bush&#x27;s administration, which Hightower claimed was beholden to corporations and extremist conservatives. It has received both the Alternative Press Award and the Independent Press Association Award for best national newsletter.

In January, 2022, Hightower noted his support for the Rights of Nature movement. After reviewing some history of the movement, he declared that the initiative to put a state constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot for voters to consider, has made Florida &quot;the epicenter&quot; of today&#x27;s Rights of Nature movement in the United States.

===Doug Jones Average===
The &quot;Doug Jones Average&quot;, a concept created by Jim Hightower, is the proposal that in order to check the true health of the American economy, it is less useful to look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average than it is to check up on how the average worker down the street (Doug Jones) is doing. If Doug Jones is on welfare, cannot feed his family, is blowing his savings, and is three weeks behind on his bills, the Doug Jones average is &quot;down&quot;. If Doug just got a raise, can pay his bills and Doug and his family are looking into owning a nice but not too expensive house, the Doug Jones average is &quot;up&quot;.

<text>In aviation, a variometer – also known as a rate of climb and descent indicator (RCDI), rate-of-climb indicator, vertical speed indicator (VSI), or vertical velocity indicator (VVI) – is one of the flight instruments in an aircraft used to inform the pilot of the rate of descent or climb. It can be calibrated in metres per second, feet per minute (1 ft/min = 0.00508 m/s) or knots (1 kn ≈ 0.514 m/s), depending on country and type of aircraft. It is typically connected to the aircraft&#x27;s external static pressure source.

In powered flight, the pilot makes frequent use of the VSI to ascertain that level flight is being maintained, especially during turning maneuvers. In gliding, the instrument is used almost continuously during normal flight, often with an audible output, to inform the pilot of rising or sinking air. It is usual for gliders to be equipped with more than one type of variometer. The simpler type does not need an external source of power and can therefore be relied upon to function regardless of whether a battery or power source has been fitted. The electronic type with audio needs a power source to be operative during the flight. The instrument is of little interest during launching and landing, with the exception of aerotow, where the pilot will usually want to avoid releasing in sink.


==History==
In 1930, according to Ann Welch, &quot;Kronfeld...was one of the first to use a variometer, a device suggested by Alexander Lippisch.&quot; Welch goes on to state that the &quot;first real thermal soaring&quot; occurred in 1930 by A. Haller and Wolf Hirth, with Hirth using a variometer in his Musterle. Frank Irving states that Arthur Kantrowitz first mentioned total energy in 1940. However, as early as 1901, Wilbur Wright wrote about thermals, &quot;when gliding operators have attained greater skill, they can, with comparative safety, maintain themselves in the air for hours at a time in this way, and thus by constant practice so increase their knowledge and skill that they can rise into the higher air and search out the currents which enable the soaring birds to transport themselves to any desired point, by first rising in a circle, and then sailing off at a descending angle.&quot;

==Description==

According to Paul MacCready, &quot;A variometer is essentially a pressure altimeter with a leak which tends to make it read the altitude of a moment earlier. It consists of a container vented to the outside air in such a way that the pressure inside the flask lags slightly behind the outside static pressure. The rate of climb measurement comes from the rate-of-air inflow or outflow from the container.&quot;

Variometers measure the rate of change of altitude by detecting the change in air pressure (static pressure) as altitude changes. Common types of variometers include those based on a diaphragm, a vane (horn), a taut band, or are electric based. The vane variometer consists of a rotating vane, centered by a coil spring, dividing a chamber into two parts, one connected to a static port, and the other to an expansion chamber. Electric variometers use thermistors sensitive to airflow, or circuit boards consisting of variable resistors connected to the membrane of a tiny vacuum cavity.

A simple variometer can be constructed by adding a large reservoir (a vacuum flask) to augment the storage capacity of a common aircraft rate-of-climb instrument. In its simplest electronic form, the instrument consists of an air bottle connected to the external atmosphere through a sensitive air flow meter. As the aircraft changes altitude, the atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft changes and air flows into or out of the air bottle to equalise the pressure inside the bottle and outside the aircraft. The rate and direction of flowing air is measured by the cooling of one of two self-heating thermistors and the difference between the thermistor resistances will cause a voltage difference; this is amplified and displayed to the pilot. The faster the aircraft is ascending (or descending), the faster the air flows. Air flowing out of the bottle indicates that the altitude of the aircraft is increasing. Air flowing into the bottle indicates that the aircraft is descending.

Newer variometer designs directly measure the static pressure of the atmosphere using a pressure sensor and detect changes in altitude directly from the change in air pressure instead of by measuring air flow. These designs tend to be smaller as they do not need the air bottle. They are more reliable as there is no bottle to be affected by changes in temperature and fewer chances for leaks to occur in the connecting tubes.

The designs described above, which measure the rate of change of altitude by automatically detecting the change in static pressure as the aircraft changes altitude are referred to as &quot;uncompensated&quot; variometers. The term &quot;vertical speed indicator&quot; or &quot;VSI&quot; is most often used for the instrument when it is installed in a powered aircraft. The term &quot;variometer&quot; is most often used when the instrument is installed in a glider or sailplane.

An &quot;Inertial-lead&quot; or &quot;Instantaneous&quot; VSI (IVSI) uses accelerometers to provide a quicker response to changes in vertical speed.


==Purpose==

Human beings, unlike birds and other flying animals, are not able directly to sense climb and sink rates. Before the invention of the variometer, sailplane pilots found it very hard to soar. Although they could readily detect abrupt &quot;changes&quot; in vertical speed (&quot;in the seat of the pants&quot;), their senses did not allow them to distinguish lift from sink, or strong lift from weak lift. The &quot;actual&quot; climb/sink rate could not even be guessed at, unless there was some clear fixed visual reference nearby. Being near a fixed reference means being near to a hillside, or to the ground. Except when hill-soaring (exploiting the lift close to the up-wind side of a hill), these are generally very unprofitable positions for glider pilots to be in. The most useful forms of lift (thermal and wave lift) are found at higher altitudes and it is very hard for a pilot to detect or exploit them without the use of a variometer. After the variometer was invented in 1929 by Alexander Lippisch and Robert Kronfeld, the sport of gliding moved into a new realm.

Variometers also became important in foot-launch hang gliding, where the open-to-air pilot hears the wind but needs the variometer to help him or her to detect regions of rising or sinking air. In early hang gliding, variometers were not needed for the short flights or flights close to ridge lift. But the variometer became key as pilots began making longer flights. The first portable variometer for use in hang gliders was the Colver Variometer, introduced in the 1970s by Colver Soaring Instruments, which served to extend the sport into cross-country thermal flying. In the 1980s, Ball Variometers Inc., founded in 1971 by Richard Harding Ball (1921–2011), produced a wrist variometer powered by a 9-volt battery.

==Total energy compensation==
As the sport of gliding developed, however, it was found that these very simple &quot;uncompensated&quot; instruments had their limitations. The information that glider pilots really need to soar is the total change in energy experienced by the glider, including both altitude and speed. An uncompensated variometer will simply indicate vertical speed of the glider, giving rise to the possibility of a &quot;stick thermal,&quot; i.e., a change in altitude caused by stick input only. If a pilot pulls back on the stick, the glider will rise, but also slow down as well. But if a glider is rising without the speed changing, this is an indication of real lift, not &quot;stick lift.&quot;

Compensated variometers also include information about the speed of the aircraft, so the total energy (potential and kinetic) is used, not just the change in altitude. For example, if a pilot pushes forward on the stick, speeding up as the plane dives, an uncompensated variometer only indicates that altitude is being lost. But the pilot could pull back on the stick, trading the extra speed for altitude again. A compensated variometer uses both speed and altitude to indicate the change in total energy. So the pilot that pushes the stick forward, diving to gain speed, and then pulls back again to regain altitude will notice no change in total energy on a compensated variometer (neglecting energy loss due to drag).

According to Helmut Reichmann, &quot;The word &#x27;variometer&#x27; means literally &#x27;change meter,&#x27; and this is how it should be understood. Without further information it remains unclear what changes are being measured. The simple variometers...are rate of climb indicators. Since the actual sailplane climb and sink displayed on these instruments depends not only on airmass movement and sailplane performance, but also in large part on angle-of-attack changes (elevator movements)...This makes it virtually impossible to extract useful information, such as - for instance - the location of thermals. While rate of climb indicators show altitude changes and hence changes in the potential energy of the sailplane, total-energy variometers indicate changes in the total energy of the sailplane, that is, both its potential energy (due to altitude) and its kinetic energy (due to airspeed).&quot;

Most modern sailplanes are equipped with &quot;Total Energy compensated&quot; variometers.

===Total energy compensation in theory===

The total energy of the aircraft is:

1. formula_1

where formula_2 is the potential energy, and formula_3 is the kinetic energy. So the change in total energy is:

2. formula_4

Since

3. Potential energy is proportional to height

formula_5

where formula_6 is the glider mass and formula_7 the acceleration of gravity

and

4. Kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared,

formula_8

then from 2:

5. formula_9

6. Typically, this is converted to an effective altitude change by dividing by the acceleration of gravity, and the mass of the aircraft, so:

formula_10

===Total energy compensation in practice===

Total-Energy Variometers use a membrane compensator, compensation by venturi, or are electronically compensated. The membrane compensator is an elastic membrane, which flexes according to the total pressure (pitot plus static) from airspeed. Thus, airspeed effects cancel out an increase in sink, due to acceleration, or a decrease in sink, due to deceleration. The venturi compensator supplies a speed-dependent negative pressure, so that the pressure reduces as speed increases, compensating for the increased static pressure due to sink. According to Helmut Reichmann, &quot;...the least sensitive venturi mounting point would appear to be on the upper quarter of the vertical fin, some 60 cm (2 feet) forward of the leading edge.&quot; Venturi compensator types include the Irving Venturi (1948), the Althaus Venturi, the Hüttner Venturi, the Brunswick Tube, the Nicks Venturi, and the Double-Slotted Tube, developed by Bardowicks of Akaflieg Hannover, also known as the Braunschweig Tube.

Very few powered aircraft have total energy variometers. Pilots of powered aircraft are more interested in the true rate of change of altitude, as they often want to hold a constant altitude or maintain a steady climb or descent.

==Netto variometer==

A second type of compensated variometer is the Netto or airmass variometer. In addition to TE compensation, the Netto variometer adjusts for the intrinsic sink rate of the glider at a given speed (the polar curve) adjusted for the wing loading due to water ballast. The Netto variometer will always read zero in still air. This provides the pilot with the accurate measurement of air mass vertical movement critical for final glides (the last glide to the ultimate destination location).

In 1954, Paul MacCready wrote about a sinking speed correction for a total energy venturi. MacCready stated, &quot;In still air...a glider has a different sinking speed at each airspeed...it would be nicer if the variometer automatically added the sink rate, and thus showed the vertical air motion instead of the vertical glider motion. The correction can be made by a variety of methods. Probably the nicest is to utilize the total energy venturi and the dynamic pressure from the pitot tube.&quot; As Reichmann explained, a &quot;Netto variometer shows the climb and sink of airmass (not of the sailplane!)...In order to achieve a &#x27;net&#x27; indication, the always present polar sink of the sailplane must be &#x27;compensated out&#x27; of the indication. To do this, one makes use of the fact that above the speed for best glide the polar sink speed of the sailplane increases roughly with the square of the airspeed. Since the pitot pressure also increases with the square of the speed, one can use it to &#x27;compensate away&#x27; the effect of sailplane polar sink over virtually the entire speed range.&quot; Tom Brandes states, &quot;Netto is simply the German way of saying &#x27;net,&#x27; and a Netto Variometer System (or polar compensator) is simply one that tells you the net vertical air movement with the sailplane movement or sink taken out of the usual variometer reading.&quot;

The Relative Netto Variometer indicates the vertical speed the glider would achieve IF it flies at thermalling speed - independent of current air speed and attitude. This reading is calculated as the Netto reading minus the glider&#x27;s minimum sink. When the glider circles to thermal, the pilot needs to know the glider&#x27;s vertical speed instead of that of the air mass. The Relative Netto Variometer (or sometimes the super Netto) includes a g-sensor to detect thermalling. When thermalling, the sensor will detect acceleration (gravity plus centrifugal) above 1 g and tell the relative netto variometer to stop subtracting the sailplane&#x27;s wing load-adjusted polar sink rate for the duration. Some earlier nettos used a manual switch instead of the g sensor.

==Electronic variometers==
In 1954, MacCready pointed out the advantages of an Audio Variometer, &quot;There is much to be gained if the variometer indication is presented to the pilot by sound. More than any other instrument except during blind flying, the variometer must be watched continuously. if the pilot can get the reading by ear, he can improve his thermal flying by watching nearby gliders, and he can materially improve the overall flight by studying the cloud formations to be used next.&quot;

In modern gliders, most electronic variometers generate a sound whose pitch and rhythm depends on the instrument reading. Typically the audio tone increases in frequency as the variometer shows a higher rate of climb and decreases in frequency towards a deep groan as the variometer shows a faster rate of descent. When the variometer is showing a climb, the tone is often chopped and the rate of chopping may be increased as the climb rate increases, while during a descent the tone is not chopped. The vario is typically silent in still air or in lift which is weaker than the typical sink rate of the glider at minimum sink. This audio signal allows the pilot to concentrate on the external view instead of having to watch the instruments, thus improving safety and also giving the pilot more opportunity to search for promising looking clouds and other signs of lift. A variometer that produces this type of audible tone is known as an &quot;audio variometer&quot;.

Advanced electronic variometers in gliders can present other information to the pilot from GPS receivers. The display can thus show the bearing, distance and height required to reach an objective. In cruise mode (used in straight flight), the vario can also give an audible indication of the correct speed to fly depending on whether the air is rising or sinking. The pilot merely has to input the estimated MacCready setting, which is the expected rate of climb in the next acceptable thermal.

There is an increasing trend for advanced variometers in gliders towards flight computers (with variometer indications) which can also present information such as controlled airspace, lists of turnpoints and even collision warnings. Some will also store positional GPS data during the flight for later analysis.

==Radio controlled soaring==

Variometers are also used in radio controlled gliders. Each variometer system consists of a radio transmitter in the glider, and a receiver on the ground for use by the pilot. Depending on the design, the receiver may give the pilot the current altitude of the glider, and a display that indicates if the glider is gaining or losing altitude—often via an audio tone. Other forms of telemetry may also be provided by the system, displaying parameters such as airspeed and battery voltage. Variometers used in radio controlled gliders may or may not feature total energy compensation.

Variometers are not essential in radio controlled gliders; a skilled pilot can usually determine if the glider is going up or down via visual cues alone. The use of variometers is prohibited in some soaring contests for radio controlled gliders.

<text>Holy Roller or Holy Jumper are terms originating in the 19th century and used to refer to some Protestant Christian churchgoers in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement, such as Free Methodists and Wesleyan Methodists. The term describes dancing, shaking or other boisterous movements by church attendees who perceive themselves as being under the influence of the Holy Spirit.

Holy Rolling is sometimes used derisively by those outside these denominations, as if to describe people literally rolling on the floor in an uncontrolled manner. Those within related Wesleyan traditions have reclaimed the term as a badge of honor.

Occasionally, they have been referred to as followers of the &quot;pokeweed gospel&quot; or members of the &quot;lightning bug church.&quot;

== Description ==
&quot;Holy Roller&quot; refers to Protestant Christian churchgoers in the holiness movement, such as Free Methodists and Wesleyan Methodists. Holy Rolling is sometimes used derisively by those outside these denominations, as if to describe people literally rolling on the floor in an uncontrolled manner. 

Many individuals in the wider Methodist tradition are also referred to by others as &quot;Shouting Methodists&quot; due to the ejaculatory prayers congregants often utter during the service of worship, such as &quot;Praise the Lord!&quot;, &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;, and &quot;Amen!

Similar disparaging terms directed at outspoken Christians but later embraced by them include Jesus freaks or, from former centuries, Methodists, Quakers, and Shakers.

With the rise of Holiness Pentecostalism in the early 20th century, the term &quot;Holy Roller&quot; has been applied to Holiness Pentecostals as well.

==History==
Merriam-Webster traces the expression to 1841. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites an 1893 memoir by Charles Godfrey Leland, in which he says &quot;When the Holy Spirit seized them ... the Holy Rollers ... rolled over and over on the floor.&quot; The term describes dancing, shaking or other boisterous movements by church attendees who perceive themselves as being under the influence of the Holy Spirit.

Those within related Wesleyan traditions have reclaimed the term as a badge of honor; for example William Branham wrote: &quot;And what the world calls today holy-roller, that&#x27;s the way I worship Jesus Christ.&quot; Gospel singer Andraé Crouch stated, &quot;They call us holy rollers, and what they say is true. But if they knew what we were rollin&#x27; about, they&#x27;d be rollin&#x27; too.&quot; Decades earlier, in the notes for his 1960 album &quot;Blues &amp; Roots&quot;, jazz musician Charles Mingus used the term, seemingly neutrally and as a simple description, to indicate his own religious upbringing.

==Usage==
=== Politics ===
*Gifford Pinchot in 1919: &quot;Apparently no meeting for any purpose is to be tolerated except the Holy Roller meetings themselves. These theoretically and in fact ... The Holy Roller church in this community, as elsewhere, in its total influence promotes immorality. ...&quot;
* &quot;The New York Times&quot; on May 2, 1923: &quot;Bound Brook Mob Raids Klan Meeting: Thousand Hostile Citizens Surround Church and Lock In 100 Holy Rollers. ... Until the arrival of eight State troopers to reinforce the local police here at 1 o&#x27;clock this morning about one hundred members of the Holy Rollers were ...&quot;
* &quot;Time&quot; on October 12, 1936: &quot;When Jesus Christ first appeared to His assembled disciples after His resurrection, He told them that believers &#x27;shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents&#x27; (Mark: 16:17, 18). To many a U. S. religionist of the Pentecostal or &quot;Holy Roller&quot; variety, the &#x27;gift of tongues&#x27; has long been vivid reality.
* Sarah Palin on January 19, 2016, referred to some in the crowd as &quot;holy rollers&quot; when she endorsed Donald Trump: &quot;Looking around at all of you, you hard working Iowa families, you farm families and teachers and teamsters and cops and cooks, you rock and rollers and holy rollers! You all make the world go around and now our cause is one.&quot;

<text>The Rubicon (; ; ) is a shallow river in northeastern Italy, just south of Cesena and north of Rimini. 
It was known as Fiumicino until 1933, when it was identified with the ancient river Rubicon, famously crossed by Julius Caesar in 49 BC.

The river flows for around from the Apennine Mountains to the Adriatic Sea through the south of the Emilia-Romagna region, between the towns of Rimini and Cesena.

==Etymology==
The Latin word comes from the adjective , meaning &quot;red&quot;. The river was so named because its waters are colored red by iron deposits in the riverbed.

==History==
During the Roman Republic, the Rubicon marked the boundary between the Roman province of Cisalpine Gaul and the areas directly controlled by Rome and its (allies), to the south. On the north-western side, the border was marked by the river Arno, a much wider and more important waterway, which flows westward from the Apennine Mountains (the Arno and the Rubicon rise not far from each other) into the Tyrrhenian Sea.

===Caesar&#x27;s crossing===

In 49 BC, perhaps on the 10th January, Julius Caesar led a single legion, Legio XIII Gemina, south over the Rubicon from Cisalpine Gaul to Italy to make his way to Rome. In doing so, he deliberately broke the law limiting his , making armed conflict inevitable. Suetonius depicts Caesar as undecided as he approached the river, and attributes the crossing to a supernatural apparition. It was reported that Caesar dined with Sallust, Hirtius, Gaius Oppius, Lucius Cornelius Balbus, and Servius Sulpicius Rufus on the night after his crossing.

According to Suetonius, Caesar uttered the famous phrase (&#x27;the die is cast&#x27;) upon crossing the Rubicon, signifying that his action was irreversible. The phrase &quot;crossing the Rubicon&quot; is now used to refer to committing irrevocably to a grave course of action, similar to the modern phrase &quot;passing the point of no return,&quot; but with the added connotation of risking danger. The presence of Caesar and his legion in Italy forced Pompey, the consuls, and a large part of the senate to flee Rome. Caesar&#x27;s victory in the subsequent civil war ensured that he would never be punished for his actions.

===Later history===
After Caesar&#x27;s crossing, the Rubicon was a geographical feature of note until about 42 BC, when Octavian merged the Province of Cisalpine Gaul into Italia and the river ceased to be the extreme northern border of Italy. The decision robbed the Rubicon of its importance, and the name gradually disappeared from the local toponymy.

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and during the first centuries of the Middle Ages, the coastal plain between Ravenna and Rimini was flooded many times. The Rubicon, like other small rivers of the region, often changed its course during this period. For this reason, and to supply fields with water after the revival of agriculture in the late Middle Ages, during the 14th and 15th centuries, hydraulic works were built to prevent other floods and to regulate streams. As a result of this work, these rivers started to flow in straight courses, as they do today.

==Identification==
With the revival during the fifteenth century of interest in the topography of ancient Roman Italy, the matter of identifying the Rubicon in the contemporary landscape became a topic of debate among Renaissance humanists. To support the claim of the river Pisciatello, a spurious inscription forbidding the passage of an army in the name of the Roman people and Senate, the so-called &quot;Sanctio&quot;, was placed by a bridge on that river. The Quattrocento humanist Flavio Biondo was deceived by it; the actual inscription is conserved in the Museo Archeologico, Cesena. As the centuries went by, several rivers of the Adriatic coast between Ravenna and Rimini have at times been said to correspond to the ancient Rubicon.

The &quot;Via Aemilia&quot; (modern SS 9) still follows its original Roman course as it runs between the hills and the plain; it would have been the obvious course to follow as it was the only major Roman road east of the Apennine Mountains leading to and from the Po Valley. Attempts to deduce the original course of the Rubicon can be made only by studying written documents and other archaeological evidence such as Roman milestones, which indicate the distance between the ancient river and the nearest Roman towns.

The mile zero of a Roman road, from which distances were counted, was always the crossing between the Cardo and the Decumanus, the two principal streets in every Roman town, running north–south and east–west respectively. In a section of the Tabula Peutingeriana, a medieval copy of a Late Antique document showing the network of Roman roads, a river in northeastern Italy labeled &quot;fl. Rubicum&quot; is shown at a position 12 Roman miles () north of Rimini along the coastline; this is the distance between Rimini and a place called &quot;Ad Confluentes,&quot; drawn west of the Rubicon, on the Via Aemilia. However, the river-bed shape observed in Pisciatello and the Rubicon river in the present day, well below Roman-age soil layers, is likely to indicate that any possible course modification of rivers could have occurred only very close to the coastline, and therefore only slight.

Furthermore, the features of the present-day Rubicon river (north–south course, orthogonal to the Via Aemilia) and the Via Aemilia itself (a straight reach before and after the crossing, and a turn just passing by , so marking a possible administrative boundary) are common to typical geographical oriented limits of Roman age, being what made this a clue of actual identification of the present-day Rubicon River with the Fiumicino.

In 1933, after various efforts that spanned centuries, the Fiumicino, which crossed the town of Savignano di Romagna (now Savignano sul Rubicone), was officially identified as the former Rubicon. Strong evidence supporting this theory came in 1991, when three Italian scholars (Pignotti, Ravagli, and Donati), after a comparison between the Tabula Peutingeriana and other ancient sources (including Cicero), showed that the distance from Rome to the Rubicon River was 200 Roman miles. Key elements of their work are:
* The locality of San Giovanni in Compito (now a western quarter of Savignano) has to be identified with the old &quot;Ad Confluentes&quot; (&quot;compitum&quot; means &quot;road junction&quot;, and is synonymous with &quot;confluentes&quot;).
* The distance between &quot;Ad Confluentes&quot; and Rome, according to the Tabula Peutingeriana, is 201 Roman miles.
* The distance from today&#x27;s San Giovanni in Compito and the Fiumicino river is one Roman mile ().

==Present==
Today there is no visible, material evidence of Caesar&#x27;s historical passage. Savignano sul Rubicone is an industrial town and the river has become one of the most polluted in the Emilia-Romagna region. Exploitation of underground waters along the upper course of the Rubicon has reduced its flow—it was a minor river even during Roman times (&quot;parvi Rubiconis ad undas&quot; as Lucan said, &quot;to the waves of [the] tiny Rubicon&quot;)—and has since lost its natural route, except in its upper course, between low and woody hills.

<text>Christopher Russell Edward Squire (4March 1948 – 27June 2015) was an English musician, singer and songwriter best known as the bassist and backing vocalist of the progressive rock band Yes. He was the longest-serving original member, having remained in the band until his death and appearing on every studio album released from 1969 to 2014. In 2017, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes.

Squire was widely regarded as the dominant bassist among the English progressive rock bands, influencing peers and later generations of bassists with his incisive sound and elaborately contoured, melodic bass lines. His name was associated with his trademark instrument, the Rickenbacker 4001 (British model RM1999). From 1991 to 2000, Rickenbacker produced a limited-edition signature model bass in his name, the 4001CS.

==Early life==
Squire was born on 4 March 1948 in the north-west London suburb of Kingsbury, to Peter and Joanne Squire. He grew up there and in the nearby Queensbury and Wembley areas. His father was a cab driver and his mother a secretary for an estate agent. As a youngster Squire took a liking to records by Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald that belonged to his father, though his main interest was church music. At the age of six, he joined the church choir at St. Andrew&#x27;s in Kingsbury as a treble along with Andrew Pryce Jackman, a friend who lived nearby. The choir got to perform at St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Their choirmaster Barry Rose was an early influence on Squire. &quot;He made me realise that working at it was the way to become best at something&quot;. Squire also sang in the choir at his next school, Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School, then located in Hampstead. He played the harmonica on his way home from school.

Squire did not consider a music career until the age of sixteen when the Beat music boom in the early 1960s and the emergence of the Beatles inspired him to &quot;be in a group that don&#x27;t use music stands&quot;. A schoolfriend recommended that Squire take up the bass after pointing out his tall frame and large hands, thinking they were ideal for playing the instrument. Squire then purchased his first bass, a Futurama, which he described as &quot;very cheap, but good enough to learn on&quot;. In 1964, on the last day before the summer holidays, Squire&#x27;s headmaster suspended him and a friend for having their hair too long and they were given two shillings and sixpence to have it cut. Instead, they went home and never returned. After his mother took him to a recruitment agency and enquired for work related to music, Squire landed work selling guitars at a Boosey &amp; Hawkes shop in Regent Street. He used the staff discount offer to purchase a new bass, a Rickenbacker 4001, in 1965.

==Career==

===Early career===
Squire&#x27;s first band was the Syn, a rock and rhythm and blues band that featured Jackman on keyboards and Martin Adelman on drums. Their first public performance took place at The Graveyard, a youth club in the hall of St. Andrew&#x27;s. In 1965, following several personnel changes, Squire, Jackman and Adelman teamed with singer Steve Nardelli, guitarist John Painter, and drummer Gunnar Jökull Hákonarson to form a new group, the Syn. The group performed Tamla Motown covers before they changed direction towards psychedelic rock. After several months, Painter was replaced by guitarist Peter Banks. The new line-up gained a following large enough to secure a weekly residency at the Marquee Club in Soho, which was followed by a recording contract with Deram Records. The band once opened for The Jimi Hendrix Experience at the venue, &quot;So I saw what was possible, and I just had this innate faith that I was going to make it.&quot; Together they released two singles before they disbanded.

Squire was fond of using LSD in the 1960s; a visit to the UFO Club on the drug on Friday which lasted through Saturday, and recovery on Sunday, became a regular event until a 1967 incident where he had a bad trip on a friend&#x27;s home-made LSD. When the police asked him to reveal who gave it to him, Squire pretended to be disoriented and made up a story that involved an unknown Australian he met at a Wimpy restaurant beforehand. He recalled, &quot;It was the last time I ever took it, having ended up in hospital in Fulham for a couple of days not knowing who I was, or what I was, or who anybody else was.&quot; After his discharge from hospital, Squire spent several months in his girlfriend&#x27;s apartment, afraid to leave, only managing to visit the corner shop. He spent each day practising his bass playing which resulted in his distinct style, citing bassists John Entwistle, Jack Bruce, Paul McCartney, Larry Graham, and Bill Wyman as early influences.

===Yes===

In September 1967, Squire joined Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop, a psychedelic group that included Peter Banks, singer Clive Bayley and drummer Bob Hagger. They played at the Marquee club where Jack Barrie, owner of the La Chasse drinking club a few doors down, saw them perform. &quot;The musicianship ... was very good but it was obvious they weren&#x27;t going anywhere&quot;, he recalled. One evening at La Chasse, Barrie introduced Squire to Jon Anderson, a worker at the bar who had not found success as the lead singer of The Gun or as a solo artist. The two found they shared common musical interests including Simon &amp; Garfunkel, The Association and vocal harmonies. In the following days they developed &quot;Sweetness&quot;, a track later recorded for the first Yes album.
As the band developed, Anderson and Squire brought in drummer Bill Bruford, keyboardist Tony Kaye and Banks for rehearsals. The five agreed to drop the name Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop; they settled on the name Yes, originally Banks&#x27;s idea. The band played their first show as Yes at a youth camp in East Mersea, Essex on 3 August 1968. Squire spoke about the band&#x27;s formation: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get session work because most musicians hated my style. They wanted me to play something a lot more basic. We started Yes as a vehicle to develop everyone&#x27;s individual styles.&quot; Squire developed a bass solo named &quot;A Bass Odyssey&quot;.

In August 1969, Yes released their self-titled debut album. Martyn Adelman, who had played drums with Squire&#x27;s first group, did the album photos. Squire received writing credits on four of the album&#x27;s eight tracks—&quot;Beyond &amp; Before&quot;, &quot;Looking Around&quot;, &quot;Harold Land&quot;, and &quot;Sweetness&quot;.

After Bruford left the band and was replaced by Alan White in July 1972, Squire altered his playing to suit the change in the band&#x27;s rhythm section. He felt he was &quot;playing too much, though I was never really sure. With Bill, the things that I did felt right ... With Alan, I found that I was able to play a bit less than before and still get my playing across.&quot;

Squire described his playing on &quot;The Remembering (High the Memory)&quot; from &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973) as &quot;one of the nicest things I think I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;.

Squire was the only member to play on each of the 21 studio albums released by Yes from 1969 to 2014. He was seen as one of the main forces behind the band&#x27;s music, as well as being &quot;perhaps the most enigmatic&quot; group member. &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot; was his final studio album.

While most of the band&#x27;s lyrics were written by Anderson, Squire co-wrote much of their music with guitarist Steve Howe (with Anderson occasionally contributing). In addition, Squire and Howe would supply backing vocals in harmony with Anderson on songs such as &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;.

During the band&#x27;s formative years Squire was frequently known for his lateness, a habit that Bruford often complained about. Because of this, Squire would frequently drive at unsafe speeds to get to gigs on time, once causing an accident on the way to a gig in West Germany after he fell asleep at the wheel, although nobody was injured. A posthumous commemorative brown plaque was titled in such a way as to make reference to his habitual lateness, namely &quot;&#x27;The Late&#x27; Chris Squire&quot;.

As Squire, along with Alan White and Steve Howe, co-owned the &quot;Yes&quot; name at the time, the 1989 ABWH line-up without him (which contained Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman and Howe) could not record under that name.

Following Squire&#x27;s death on 27 June 2015, the band&#x27;s show on 7 August of the same year marked the first Yes concert ever performed without him. Former member Billy Sherwood replaced Squire during their 2015 North American tour with Toto from August to September 2015, as well as their performances in November 2015, as announced when the band first revealed Squire&#x27;s disease in May 2015.

===Other projects===
Squire concentrated overwhelmingly on Yes&#x27; music over the years, producing little solo work. His first solo record was 1975&#x27;s &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot;, featuring Yes alumni Bill Bruford on drums and Patrick Moraz on keyboards and The Syn/The Selfs alumnus Andrew Jackman also on keyboards.

In 1981, Squire was a member of the short lived XYZ, short for eX-Yes/Zeppelin (Squire claimed his father had come up with the name) together with White and guitarist Jimmy Page. XYZ recorded several demo tracks, but never produced anything formal, though two of the demos provided the basis for two later Yes tracks, &quot;Mind Drive&quot; and &quot;Can You Imagine?&quot; Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant was not ready, despite Page&#x27;s promises, to get involved with the band so soon after the death of Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. According to Squire, Zeppelin manager Peter Grant objected to the name as the &quot;Y&quot; appeared before the &quot;Z&quot; in the name. The group then &quot;fizzled out&quot;.

Squire also played a role in bringing Trevor Rabin into the Cinema band project, which became the &quot;90125&quot; line-up of Yes.

In later years, Squire would join with Yes guitarist Billy Sherwood in a side project called Conspiracy. This band&#x27;s self-titled debut album in 2000 contained the nuclei of several songs that had appeared on Yes&#x27; recent albums. Conspiracy&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Unknown&quot;, was released in 2003.

In late 2004, Squire joined a reunion of The Syn. The reformed band released the album &quot;Syndestructible&quot; in 2005 before breaking up again.

Squire also worked on two solo projects with other former Syn collaborators Gerard Johnson, Jeremy Stacey and Paul Stacey. A Christmas album, &quot;Chris Squire&#x27;s Swiss Choir&quot;, was released in 2007 (with Johnson, J. Stacey and Steve Hackett). Squire collaborated again with Hackett, formerly of the band Genesis, to make the Squackett album &quot;A Life Within a Day&quot;, released in 2012.

==Style and legacy==

Squire&#x27;s unique tone was very clear and distinct, and his playing was noted for being aggressive, dynamic and melodic.

Squire played primarily with a pick (usually a grey Herco &quot;heavy&quot;) held with the tip very close to his own fingertips, meaning that his thumb would also strike the strings right after the pick, causing subtle harmonics.
He made frequent use of hammer-ons, pull-offs as well as alternate and tremolo picking. Aside from his use of distortion, Squire occasionally used other effects, most notably chorus, flanger and wah-wah pedals, which until then had mostly been used by guitarists.

In a 1973 interview for &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, Squire recalled how he had obtained his distinctive tone at the time by rewiring his RM1999 into stereo and sending the bass and treble pick-ups each into a separate amplifier. By splitting the signal from his bass into dual high and low frequency outputs and then sending the low frequency output to a conventional bass amplifier and the high-frequency output to a separate lead guitar amplifier, Squire produced a tonal &quot;sandwich&quot; that added a growling, overdrive edge to the sound while retaining the Rickenbacker&#x27;s powerful bass response. This gave his bass sound bright, growling higher frequencies and clean, solid bass frequencies.

This technique allowed Squire to use harmonic distortion on his bass while avoiding the flat, fuzzy sound, loss of power and poor bass response that typically occurs when bass guitars are overdriven through an amplifier or put through a fuzz box. Squire also made notable use of fret buzz, a normally undesirable condition caused by low string action, to create a further, growling edge to his playing.

He also played with a pick which contributed to the sharp attack as well as using fresh Rotosound Swing Bass strings for every show. Squire&#x27;s intricate and complex bass playing style has influenced subsequent bassists such as Billy Sheehan, Geddy Lee of Rush, Mike Mills of R.E.M., Steve Di Giorgio of Death and Sadus, Pat Badger of Extreme, Jon Camp of Renaissance, Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, Les Claypool of Primus, John Myung of Dream Theater, Robert DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots and John Cooper of Skillet. John Deacon of Queen was also inspired by Squire, and told &quot;Guitar Magazine&quot; that Squire was his favourite bass player.

===Instruments and equipment===
Squire&#x27;s main instrument was a 1964 Rickenbacker bass which he bought and began playing in 1965. Although generally referred to as having been a 4001 model, it was actually from the RM1999 series, a British export version of the 4001 (Squire&#x27;s had the serial number DC127). Squire mentioned in a 1979 interview with &quot;Circus Weekly&quot; that he acquired this bass while working at the Boosey &amp; Hawkes music store in London. Before acquiring its final distinctive cream-coloured lacquer, the bass had twice been customised with a paper finish (firstly with flowery wallpaper and subsequently with silver reflective paper) and on each occasion had had to be sanded down when the paper was removed, reducing its mass and altering its resonance. A faulty bridge pickup with lower output and “tinny sound,” was another part of the instrument&#x27;s sonic character, with Squire incorporating the existing fault by using it as backup and support to the other, fully-working pickup (adding to the overall harmonic output). The instrument, with its warmth, was a significant part of Squire&#x27;s unique sound. Due to its distinctive tone, which has been compared to that of a guitar, it allowed the bass to take on a more &quot;lead&quot; role, which created a dynamic sound, and suited Squire perfectly.

Although Squire is usually associated with the Rickenbacker, he played many different models of bass guitar throughout his career, selecting each instrument according to the demands of the song and the approach of the time. In addition to four-string bass, he was an early pioneer of eight-string bass, occasionally played fretless bass, and had an interest in integrating technology into his instruments.

In the early years of Yes, Squire played a Fender Telecaster bass almost as frequently as he played his Rickenbacker RM1999. During the mid-1970s, he played a Fender Jazz bass on specific tracks such as &#x27;The Gates of Delirium&#x27; and a Gibson Thunderbird on tracks including &quot;Release, Release&quot;. In 1980, Squire obtained an MPC Electra 4-string with built-in effects units (heard to best effect on &quot;Drama&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;. Yes&#x27; 1983 comeback single &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; featured a custom green four-string designed by Jim Mouradian, while during the late 1980s Squire played a variety of Tobias four and five-string basses (using these almost exclusively on 1987&#x27;s &quot;Big Generator&quot; album). Later in his life, Squire added to his armoury of four-string basses with models by Lakland and Yamaha.

Squire began playing eight-string bass in the early 1970s. His initial choice was a prototype Rickenbacker eight-string, but from the mid-1970s onwards this was superseded by a custom instrument made by Ranney (on &quot;Fortune Seller&quot; from Yes&#x27; 1998 album &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, he played his bandmate Billy Sherwood&#x27;s unique Spector 8-string). While his playing of fretless bass was infrequent, he would use a fretless Guild model on those occasions. 

Apart from his Rickenbacker, Squire played another iconic bass guitar – a custom triple-neck made by Wal and originally constructed for Roger Newell of the Rick Wakeman band, and which Wakeman subsequently gifted to Squire. This instrument was used for live performances of the Yes song &quot;Awaken&quot;, for stage impact and to avoid the necessity for rapid changes between instruments for different parts (as had been the case in the studio version). It was adapted for Squire&#x27;s purposes, with the top neck being a six-string bass with doubled A, D, and G strings, the middle neck being a standard fretted four-string, and the bottom neck being a fretless four-string.

Squire was an enthusiastic user of bass pedals, initially playing Moog Taurus pedals but later replacing them with samples triggered from an E-Mu ESI2000 sampler via a pedal array.

Squire&#x27;s choice of effects pedals included Maestro Fuzz-Tone, TC Electronic Stereo Chorus Flanger, TC Nova Reverb, Boss OC-3 Super Octave, Mu-Tron III, and custom-made tremolo pedals. Throughout his career, Squire used a Marshall 100-watt amp and 4x12 cabinet, but over time also used Sunn amps and cabinets, Ampeg SVT-2 PROs, Ampeg 8x10 cabs, and a pair of Clair Brothers custom 6x12 cabinets with directional speakers.

In addition to bass guitar and bass pedals, Squire also occasionally played harmonica, piano and six or twelve-string guitar.

==Personal life==
Squire was married three times and had five children.

Squire met his first wife Nikki in 1970 at a club in London. They married in 1972. She sang on the 1981 Christmas single &quot;Run with the Fox&quot; and also the track &quot;Hold Out Your Hand&quot; from &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; (1975). In 1983, she formed Esquire, on whose first album Chris, Alan White, and Trevor Horn assisted. They had three daughters: Carmen, Chandrika, and Camille Squire. The couple divorced after fifteen years of marriage.

Squire married actress Melissa Morgan on 8 May 1993. She gave birth to their son Cameron in 2000. She played Brittany Norman on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and later returned to the daytime drama as Agnes Sorensen. 

His third and final marriage was to Scotland Squire who gave birth to their daughter Xilan in 2008. In 2014, they were living in Phoenix, Arizona, having previously resided in Chelsea.

Squire was a vegetarian in the 1970s. In 1973, he toured with the Eagles and was introduced to cocaine. At some point in his life, Squire also suffered a heart attack.

Squire&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Fish&quot;, originated due to multiple reasons. His astrological sign was Pisces, and he was known for his love of bathing. The name seems to have mostly been initiated by bandmate Bill Bruford, who has commented on how Squire spent long periods in the bathroom while they shared a house together in Fulham and how, in the early days of Yes&#x27; career, he once accidentally flooded a hotel room in Oslo, Norway, while taking a shower. Another factor in the naming is the heteronymic and punning meanings of &quot;bass&quot;, describing low frequency sound or the bass guitar as well as the fish. The nickname is incorporated into several of Squire&#x27;s works including his solo record, &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; (1975), and the solo piece &quot;The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)&quot; from the 1971 Yes record &quot;Fragile&quot;. 

In 2011, a species of fossil fish was named &quot;Tarkus squirei&quot; in Squire&#x27;s honour, referencing his nickname.

== Illness, death, and tributes ==

On 19 May 2015, Yes announced that Squire had been diagnosed with acute erythroid leukemia, and would take a break from performing while receiving treatment.

In the late evening of 27 June 2015, Squire died from the illness, aged 67, while receiving treatment in his adopted hometown of Phoenix, Arizona. Yes&#x27; official Facebook page confirmed the news the next day. Tributes were paid by fellow musicians Brian May, Geezer Butler, Gene Simmons and Tom Morello, as well as bandmates Geoff Downes and Bill Bruford. Squire died 13 years to the day after an early musical influence, John Entwistle.

In April 2016, asteroid 2002 XR80 received an official permanent name from the International Astronomical Union in honour of Squire. Asteroid (90125) Chrissquire was discovered 11 December 2002 and is a main-belt asteroid with an orbital period of 4.08 years.

In November 2018, the tribute album &quot;A Life in Yes: The Chris Squire Tribute&quot; was released by Purple Pyramid Records. It contained covers of Yes songs, performed by artists such as Jon Davison, Patrick Moraz, Steve Porcaro, Steve Hackett, Tony Kaye, Dweezil Zappa and Candice Night.

In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 18th greatest bass player of all time.

<doc id="198639" wikidata="Q1429304" url="?curid=198639" title="Ixodidae">
<text>The Ixodidae are the family of hard ticks or scale ticks, one of the three families of ticks, consisting of over 700 species. They are known as &#x27;hard ticks&#x27; because they have a scutum or hard shield, which the other major family of ticks, the &#x27;soft ticks&#x27; (Argasidae), lack. They are ectoparasites of a wide range of host species, and some are vectors of pathogens that can cause human disease.

==Description==
They are distinguished from the Argasidae by the presence of a scutum. In both the nymph and the adult, a prominent gnathosoma (or capitulum, mouth and feeding parts) projects forward from the animal&#x27;s body; in the Argasidae, conversely, the gnathosoma is concealed beneath the body.

They differ, too, in their lifecycle; Ixodidae that attach to a host bite painlessly and are generally unnoticed, and they remain in place until they engorge and are ready to change their skin; this process may take days or weeks. Some species drop off the host to moult in a safe place, whereas others remain on the same host and only drop off once they are ready to lay their eggs.

==Classification==

There are 702 species in 14 genera. The family contains these genera:

* &quot;Africaniella&quot; – 2 species
* &quot;Amblyomma&quot; – 130 species (includes some of &quot;Aponomma&quot;)
* &quot;Anomalohimalaya&quot; – 3 species
* &quot;Archaeocroton&quot; – 1 species
* &quot;Bothriocroton&quot; – 7 species
* &quot;Cosmiomma&quot; – 1 species
* &quot;Cornupalpatum&quot; – 1 species
* &quot;Compluriscutula&quot; – 1 species
* &quot;Dermacentor&quot; – 34 species (includes &quot;Anocentor&quot;)
* &quot;Haemaphysalis&quot; – 166 species
* &quot;Hyalomma&quot; – 27 species
* &quot;Ixodes&quot; – 246 species
* &quot;Margaropus&quot; – 3 species
* &quot;Nosomma&quot; – 2 species
* &quot;Rhipicentor&quot; – 2 species
* &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot; – 82 species (includes &quot;Boophilus&quot;)
* &quot;Robertsicus&quot; – 1 species
=== Fossil genera ===
* †&quot;Compluriscutula&quot; Burmese amber, Myanmar, Cenomanian
* †&quot;Cornupalpatum&quot; Burmese amber, Myanmar, Cenomanian

==Medical importance==
Many hard ticks are of considerable medical importance, acting as vectors of diseases caused by bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, such as &quot;Rickettsia&quot; and &quot;Borrelia&quot;. Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anaplasmosis, Southern tick-associated rash illness, tick-borne relapsing fever, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, Powassan encephalitis, and Q fever.

<text>The Argasidae are the family of soft ticks, one of the three families of ticks. The family contains 193 species, although the composition of the genera is less certain, and more study is needed before the genera can become stable. The currently accepted genera are &quot;Antricola&quot;, &quot;Argas&quot;, &quot;Nothoaspis&quot;, &quot;Ornithodoros&quot;, and &quot;Otobius&quot;. The Argasidae are very common in South Asia, along with 96 other species of ticks, making South Asia the region with the highest biodiversity of ticks worldwide. Soft ticks are resistant to desiccation and can live for several years in arid conditions.

==Physical characteristics==
Soft ticks lack the hard scutum present in the hard ticks (Ixodidae). The gnathosoma (or capitulum, the mouthparts-bearing structure) is located on the underside of the animal&#x27;s body and is not readily visible, while in the Ixodidae, the gnathosoma projects forward from the body. The lateral edges of the body are rounded.

<text>Moreton Bay is a bay located on the eastern coast of Australia from central Brisbane, Queensland. It is one of Queensland&#x27;s most important coastal resources. The waters of Moreton Bay are a popular destination for recreational anglers and are used by commercial operators who provide seafood to market.

The Port of Brisbane coordinates large traffic along the shipping channel which crosses the northern section of the bay. The bay serves as a safe approach to the airport and reduces noise pollution over the city to the west of the runway. A number of barge, ferry and water-taxi services also travel over the bay.

Moreton Bay was the site of conflict between the Quandamooka people and early European settlers. It contains environmentally significant habitats and large areas of sandbanks. The bay is the only place in Australia where dugong gather into herds. Many parts of the mainland foreshore and southern islands are settled.

The waters of Moreton Bay are relatively calm, being sheltered from large swells by Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Moreton Bay was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Natural attraction&quot;. Moreton Bay is a Pacific Ocean Hope Spot.

==History==

===Early history===

Moreton Bay was formed roughly 6000 years ago as the sea level rose and inundated what was then the floodplains of the Brisbane River. Moreton Bay and its islands were inhabited by the Quandamooka people. The indigenous economy was very rich, one of the strongest for its productive yields of edible natural resources on the Australian continent. Of particular importance for the interclan trade and ceremonial life were in particular massive oyster beds, the annual mullet catch, and bunya nut harvesting, on the coast and inland, which led to annual migrations either way to enjoy the abundance of the respective tribal group&#x27;s territory.

An 1823 account by explorer John Uniacke described the importance of fish, kangaroo and fern-root called dingowa in the diet of the local tribes. His paper, titled &#x27;Natives of Moreton Bay&#x27; also has a detailed summary of inter-tribal fights in the Bribie Island region, as witnessed by castaways John Finnegan and Thomas Pamphlett.

In the 1840s, resident white administrators estimated the Aboriginal population of the area to be around 4,000. They were only outnumbered with the influx over the five-year period of 1850-1855 that saw the disembarkation of 3,000 European migrants on their land.

===European exploration and settlement===








The name Morton&#x27;s Bay was given by Captain Cook when he passed the area on 15 May 1770, honouring Lord Morton, president of the Royal Society. The spelling Moreton was an error in the first published account of Cook&#x27;s voyage (Hawkesworth&#x27;s &quot;Voyages&quot;). Cook gave the name only to the bight formed by the northern end of Stradbroke Island (in 1770, there was only one island) and the eastern side of Moreton Island. He was unaware of the South Passage (as it&#x27;s now called) between the two islands, and did not sail into what is the present Moreton Bay.

Matthew Flinders was the first recorded European to enter the bay in 1799 touching down at the Pumicestone Passage, Redcliffe and Coochiemudlo Island. He was followed by John Oxley who explored the Brisbane River in 1823. On a subsequent visit in the following year, Oxley established the first European settlement in the bay at the present site of Redcliffe.

After Oxley in 1823 came convicts and soldiers. As the South Passage between Moreton and Stradbroke Islands was the shortest shipping route, a depot and pilot station were established at Amity Point in 1825.

European settlement began in earnest after the abandonment of the Redcliffe settlement, and work began on the new convict settlement several miles up the Brisbane River in 1825. Within a couple years, this new settlement was growing rapidly and the number of ships entering the bay was increasing. As a result, the facilities required to service the pilot station at Amity grew, and in 1827 convicts were sent to the island to build a new causeway at Dunwich, remnants of which can still be found on the same site. Within a year the first permanent European settlement at Dunwich had been built. Due to poor weather, smuggling, and conflict with aborigines this convict out-station was difficult to sustain and was closed in 1831.

The first immigrant ship from England, the &quot;Artemisia&quot;, reached Moreton Bay in December 1848 after a four-month journey. The next year saw the arrival of the carrying more free immigrants to the settlement.

By the 1850s, the region&#x27;s earliest industry was utilising the bay for the transport of timber. After felling, the logs were dragged or rolled into flooded streams from where they were washed downstream to tidal reaches and bound together into rafts. After the floods had ceased and tides returned to normal, the currents of the bay and sometimes boats were used to delivered the timber north to the Brisbane River or to Dunwich for shipment to Sydney.

The bay was home to the &quot;Lightship Rose&quot; which provided a permanent navigation aid to passing ships at the mouth of the Brisbane River. The &quot;SS John Oxley&quot; was another notable boat which temporarily acted as a pilot ship.

Car ferries began crossing the bay to reach North Stradbroke Island in 1947, leading to an increase in tourism on the island. In the 1950s both sand mining and the first land sales at Point Lookout occurred.

On 1 September 2007, four people were killed in a boat accident on the bay, two kilometres from the Pinkenba boat ramp. Ten others were injured.

Moreton Bay has at least 102 shipwrecks of which 26 have their exact location known. See Mount Elliot, Shipwreck for details of a lighter vessel wrecked in 1937.

===European contact with local Indigenous people===

Problems came about when the newcomers displayed a lack of respect for Aboriginal marriage rules, stole bones and other artefacts and desecrated sites important to the Aboriginals.

In 1843, Catholic missionaries chose Dunwich as the site for the first Catholic mission to Australian Aborigines. The existence of the quarantine station on Stradbroke Island from 1850 to the 1870s led to the official discouragement of pastoralism or wider settlement for fear of spreading disease.

Thus the European usage and occupation of Quandamooka in the 19th century was largely restricted to government institutions on small portions on the islands, and with free enterprise business men like the Campbell brothers who ran a saltworks and sugar plantations on Russell and Macleay islands, and the early fishing and oystering businesses in the bay who employed the Aboriginal people of Quandamooka.

Large Aboriginal campsites remained throughout the Moreton Bay region, including on the mainland, until as late as the 1920s.

==Geography and natural history==
The bay extends some from Caloundra in the north almost to Surfers Paradise in the south. The bay&#x27;s southern navigation entrance is the Gold Coast Seaway. The bay is across at its widest point.

It is separated from the Coral Sea by a chain of three sand islands: Moreton Island in the north, North Stradbroke Island, and South Stradbroke Island in the south. Tipplers Passage is the main channel on the western coast of South Stradbroke Island. The Gold Coast Seaway is at the southern extent of Moreton Bay, before the Gold Coast Broadwater.

The bay itself contains around 360 islands in total. This includes the populated Russell, Macleay, Lamb and Karragarra Islands collectively known as the Southern Moreton Bay Islands. Together with Coochiemudlo and Garden Island these are bedrock islands. Residential development has also occurred on Coochiemudlo Island and Bribie Island. In the past Peel Island has been used as a sisal plantation, quarantine station, asylum and a leper colony.

Moreton Bay is generally shallow and sandy, though a substantive channel is maintained to allow access to the Port of Brisbane at Fisherman Islands at the mouth of the Brisbane River, for international shipping. Channels in the south of the bay are only rarely deep. Waves penetrate a small way into the bay at its four southern passages. Most waves in the bay are generated by local winds. The tidal range is moderate at in range. Moreton Bay has an average depth of , however parts of the bay are deeper than . This relatively shallow depth lets light filter through to the seafloor, allowing an array of marine plants to grow which support a diverse range of fauna. The bay itself covers and has a catchment area 14 times larger, covering . The waters of the bay are mostly blue in colour. Western parts of the bay are sometimes tinted green from algae, brown from suspended sediments or yellow-brown from humic runoff. The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from in July to in February.

As well as the Brisbane River, the Pimpama River, Logan River, Albert River, Pine River, Tingalpa Creek and the Schulz Canal all empty into Moreton Bay. Within Moreton Bay are the smaller bays of Waterloo Bay, Redland Bay, Raby Bay, Deception Bay and Bramble Bay.

The bay contains a number of island villages such as the settlement on the bayside of Moreton Island, Tangalooma and on North Stradbroke, Dunwich and Amity Point. Prominent coastal communities and mainland suburbs situated on the bay include Deception Bay, Scarborough, Redcliffe, Margate, Woody Point, Brighton, Sandgate, Cleveland, Victoria Point and Redland Bay. Other attractions in the bay include Pumicestone Passage and numerous boat ramps, marinas and jetties, including the Shorncliffe pier.

===Sandbanks===
Moreton Bay is filled with sandbanks from sand supplied via littoral drift along the coast of Moreton Island. The field of sandbanks extends across the entrance to Moreton Bay and evolved after sea level reached its present position, about 6,500 years ago after the last ice age Between Tangalooma and Skirmish Point on Bribie Island are the Middle Banks, Central Banks and Western Banks. From north of Moreton Island towards Caloundra are the Yulle Road, Spitfire Bank, and the Salamander Bank, amongst others.

Amity Banks are found just west of Amity Point, while the Moreton Banks lie to the west of the southern tip of Moreton Island. These banks can be hazard for marine navigation because they are constantly changing due to tidal currents.

The Middle Banks area close to Moreton Island has been used in the past as a source of sand for large projects such as the nearby Brisbane Airport and port facilities. Past dredging has removed 18 million metres3 and the removal of another 40 million metres3 is planned. Future sand extraction is expected to aid a major shipping channel straightening project.

To ensure the shipping channel remains open, several areas of the bay have been allocated for dredged material dumping sites. These sites have been selected to provide beach nourishment, aiding the natural long shore transport of sand along ocean beaches.

===Flora and fauna===
The bay&#x27;s heritage protected wetlands, mudflats, and waterways are some of the healthiest in the region, supporting seasonally up to 25% of Australia&#x27;s bird species. The combination of muddy habitats on the western side of the bay and sandy habitats on the eastern side of the bay together with coral and seagrass beds support more than 43 species of shorebird. Seven species of seagrass live in Moreton Bay. &quot;Zostera capricorni&quot; is the most common species. Seagrass has been lost since colonization due to increased turbidity and sedimentation from erosion in the catchment.

Collectively, around 50,000 wading birds visit the Moreton Bay each year, and its wetlands are classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). In its Shorebird Management Strategy, the Queensland Government notes that: &quot;Moreton Bay&#x27;s extensive intertidal areas are essential for shorebirds as they provide roosting, feeding and, in some cases, breeding habitat.&quot;

The bay is also home to other abundant wildlife, including whales, dolphins, dugong, sharks and turtles. From 1824 to 1950 turtles were hunted for commercial purposes. The loggerhead turtle population in the bay is the most significant in the country.

The bay is ranked among the top ten dugong habitats in Australia and together with the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait is considered one of the most important areas for dugong in Queensland. Moreton Bay is the only place in Australia where dugongs gather in herds. In the past the dugongs in herds numbered in the thousands. Some herds 5 km long by 250 m wide were seen during the 1800s. In 2009, there were just between 600 and 800 remaining. The dugongs were traditional foods of indigenous Australians. They were hunted for their oil and to make other products by early Europeans up until the 1920s.

Many whale and dolphin species can be found in Moreton Bay including humpback whales, killer whales, southern right whales, sperm whales, melon-headed whales, blue whales, Bryde&#x27;s whales, minke whales, common dolphins, spinner dolphins and Risso&#x27;s dolphins. Under Australia&#x27;s EPBC Act the southern right whale is listed as endangered and the humpback whale is listed as vulnerable. Commercial tour operators offer whale watching cruises between June and September each year. Most of larger cetaceans observed in the bay are humpbacks, and several smaller dolphins live or regularly visit the bay.

The Moreton Bay bug (&quot;Thenus orientalis&quot;) is a species of slipper lobster found throughout the waters of Australia&#x27;s north coast. The bug is a relatively expensive delicacy served in many restaurants in Queensland.

The Moreton Bay fig (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;) is a large tree endemic to the east coast of Australia within a range centred on the shores and surrounds of Moreton Bay.

The southern and western parts of the bay contain shallow mud-layered waters that are protected from strong wave action by the barrier islands. This has provided excellent habitat for mangroves of which seven different species thrive within the bay, particularly in the sheltered, southern sections of the bay. The species &quot;Avicennia marina&quot; predominates.

About 1% of the bay is coral reef. Land clearing and settlement in the catchment has led to unfavourable conditions for coral growth. Climate change is expected to raise sea levels and produce warmer waters that will aid coral growth in the bay.

The bay may experience widespread outbreaks of bacteria lyngbya which can cause skin lesions and asthma attacks upon contact.

The eastern shovelnose ray is found in high abundance in Moreton Bay and has an important role in the trophic structure of the area.

===Ship strikes to marine megafauna===
One of serious threats to marine animals in Moreton Bay is ship-strikes. Dugongs and turtles in Moreton Bay are often killed or injured when struck by speeding boats.

====Southern right whales====
Unlike the southern and south-western population of Australia, southern right whales off the east coast of Australia, along with the west coast, Tasmania, and eastern Victoria, are critically endangered, consisting of only 10 or more individuals. Whales have not been seen on the east coast for many years (unlike humpbacks) as the first whale came back to both Australia and New Zealand in the early 1960s, largely due to mass illegal hunts by the Soviet Union as well as Japan, although at first it was reported to take only four whales.

Recent increases in sightings along the east coast indicate very slow but certain recovery of the species in that area, and Moreton Bay was probably a prominent calving ground for these coast-loving whales. Very small but steady appearances of southern rights have been confirmed in Moreton Bay, Gold Coast, and Hervey Bay. Seasonal presences of right whales have been recorded in Moreton Bay at least in the late 1990s, and small family groups of whales have been observed visiting the southern bay each year since 2002, especially around Toondah Harbour.

However, there was an instance of a southern right whale being fatally struck by a ferry in August 2014. This whale was a calf, and her mother was also seriously injured by the accident and her fate is still unknown. Another southern right whale, possibly with a calf was also hit few days prior to the incident with a sighting of possibly the same whales near Victoria Point. These ship-strikes and entanglements in fishing gear may contribute severely to preventing the future re-establishment of the species in the former habitats.

==Environment==

===Environmental threats===
Moreton Bay&#x27;s sea grass beds and corals are subject to ongoing threat from soil run-off caused by agriculture in the Lockyer Valley and construction activity in south east Queensland. Professor John Olley has noted that mud is now flowing out to Moreton Bay 10 times as fast as it did before Europeans settled in the region 120 years ago. The 2013 Healthy Waterways Report shows a downward trend in the ecosystem health of Moreton Bay over the period from 2012 to 2013, with water quality also affected by major flood events such as those in 2009 and 2011.

After the 2011 Brisbane River floods washed contaminated water into the bay, commercial fishermen and recreation anglers were warned not catch or eat seafood from its waters. The flood plume was investigated to monitor its impact on the bay&#x27;s marine ecosystems. It contained sewerage, pesticides, heavy metals such as lead and zinc as well as hydrocarbons.

An oil spill occurred in March 2009 from the &quot;MV Pacific Adventurer&quot; dumping of oil, of fuel and other toxic chemicals on Brisbane&#x27;s suburban beaches. Premier Anna Bligh described the spill as the &quot;worst environmental disaster Queensland has ever seen&quot;.

On 2 November 2012 the Queensland Government announced that in conjunction with the Gold Coast City Council it would call expressions of interest to develop an international cruise ship terminal and associated development for the Southport Broadwater at the southern end of Moreton Bay. On 13 February 2014 the Government announced that the ASF Consortium&#x27;s proposal &quot;has demonstrated a cruise ship terminal is a possibility that could be further developed, should the Council and the proponent choose to progress it&quot;. This project is opposed by the Gold Coast and Hinterland Environment Council.

On 31 May 2014 an approved development scheme was released for the Toondah Harbour Priority Development Area in Cleveland which would allow development of a large marina up to 400 berths in southern Moreton Bay between Toondah Harbour, G.J. Walter Park and Cassim Island. The Queensland Government released at the same time a lengthy report on the 583 submissions received in response to a draft scheme released for consultation in January 2014. The draft Toondah scheme was opposed by marine planning experts and various environmentally concerned community groups including the Bay Wilderness Society. On 4 March 2014 a petition with 1,211 signatures calling for the Government&#x27;s plans to be withdrawn was tabled in the Queensland Parliament.

===Federal government protection===
In 1993 large areas of Moreton Bay with a total area exceeding were recognised as wetlands of international significance under the Ramsar Wetland Convention 1971. Listing as a Ramsar site is justified on many grounds including:
* Moreton Bay supports large numbers of the nationally threatened green turtle, Hawksbill turtle and Loggerhead turtle.
* The site is ranked among the top ten habitats in Queensland for the internationally vulnerable dugong and is a foraging and breeding ground for the dugong.
* The Moreton Bay Ramsar site supports 55 species of algae associated with mangroves, seven species of mangrove and seven species of seagrass.
* At least 43 species of shorebirds use intertidal habitats in the bay, including 30 migratory species listed by international migratory bird conservation agreements.
* The Moreton Bay Ramsar site supports more than 50,000 wintering and staging shorebirds during the non-breeding season.
* The Moreton Bay Ramsar site regularly supports more than 1% of the population the wintering eastern curlews and the grey-tailed tattler.

Many of the migratory shorebirds which use the bay as part of the East Asian–Australasian Flyway are protected in accordance with three bilateral agreements:
* Japan–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA)
* China–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA)
* Republic of Korea–Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (ROKAMBA)

Actions that have a significant impact on a Ramsar listed site or on species which are the subject of international bird migratory agreements are &quot;matters of national environmental significance&quot; which are protected by the Federal Government in accordance with provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

===Queensland government protection===
Moreton Island is protected as Moreton Island National Park. The bay itself contains St Helena Island National Park and the Moreton Bay Marine Park with areas designated under the Marine Park Zoning Plan. The Marine Park was declared in 1993 and covers 3,400 square kilometres. Parts of the bay are also protected under the Southern Moreton Bay Islands National Park.

The bay&#x27;s marine park zoning plan was renewed in 2008. Despite angst from both commercial and recreational fishers, draft Queensland Government plans indicate further fishing restrictions aiming to protect more than 15% of important marine and coastal environments. Artificial reefs could be placed in Moreton Bay to ease the concerns of fishermen who fear they are being forced out. The Queensland Government will spend A$1 million on research, planning and construction of a new concrete reef in the bay.

To make up for the fishing areas lost to the 2009 expansion of the Moreton Bay Marine Park, the Queensland Government agreed to create a total of six artificial reefs for anglers. The reefs are constructed from specially designed balls of concrete which will provide habitat for fish species. According to former Sustainability Minister Andrew McNamara the bay produces a commercial catch valued at $25 million and that $4 million worth of this figure has become off-limits with the rezoning.

In March 2012 the Queensland Government signalled its intention to allow recreational anglers back into marine park green zones in parts of Moreton Bay. Mark Robinson, the Government&#x27;s fishing spokesman, was quoted as saying: &quot;Any changes we make would be evidence-based&quot;. On 31 January 2014 the Queensland Government announced a proposed change to marine park zoning that would relax fishing restrictions at Scotts Point on the Redcliffe Peninsula. This policy change was criticised by the Australian Marine Conservation Society whose spokesperson said: &quot;We question why Premier Newman is going against the science and the rigorously surveyed opinions of local recreational fishers to adopt a proposal that was being pushed by disgraced former MP Scott Driscoll whilst he was still the member for Redcliffe. There was no scientific process behind this decision&quot;.

In May 2014 the Queensland Government announced that MRAG Asia Pacific had been engaged to review fishing management in Queensland. MRAG has stated that while the green zones were not formally part of the review scope, it is likely that they would be discussed in the review team&#x27;s report.

==Economic aspects==
The economic value of recreational fishing in Moreton Bay has been estimated at approximately $20 million per year.

==Recreation==
The bay is popular with recreational anglers. The Moreton Bay Classic fishing competition is held annually from the Manly foreshore. There is a fishing spot near the shipwreck of Mount Elliot.

There are many sailing events held on Moreton Bay including:
* Yacht and dinghy racing organised by the Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron at Manly.
* The Brisbane to Gladstone yacht race, first staged in 1949, which starts from near the Shorncliff Pier every year on Good Friday.
* The Interclub Bay Cruise held each year in the first week of the Queensland September school holidays.

The bay is home to many other watersports and activities including kayaking, jet-skiing, windsurfing and water-skiing. Diving and snorkelling are popular around Tangalooma on Moreton Island.

<text>Johan Herman Wessel (6 October 1742 – 29 December 1785) was an 18th-century Danish-Norwegian poet, satirist and playwright. His written work was characterized by the use of parody and satiric wit.

==Biography==
Wessel was born and raised at Vestby in Akershus, Norway. He was the son of Jonas Wessel (1707–1785) and Helene Maria Schumacher (1715–1789). His father was a parish priest. He was one of thirteen children in a family. His younger brothers included mathematician Caspar Wessel (1745–1818) and jurist Ole Christopher Wessel (1744–1794) His sister-in-law was landowner Maren Juel (1749–1815) and naval hero Peter Tordenskjold (1690–1720) was his great uncle.

He entered attended Oslo Cathedral School in 1757 followed by the University of Copenhagen in 1761. At the university, he studied foreign languages. He later made a living principally as a tutor and translator. He lived most of his somewhat bohemian life in Copenhagen, dependent on casual work and weakened by bad health and drinking. Wessel became the admired centre of The Norwegian Society (&quot;Norske Selskab&quot;) a grouping of Norwegian literary figures cultivating their national identity in Copenhagen, and writing in classical metres.

==Personal life==
In 1780, he married Anna Catharia Bukier (1748–1813). They were the parents of one son, Jonas Wessel who was born in 1781. The marriage suffered from his alcoholism, depression and inability as a provider. Johan Herman Wessel died at age 43 in Copenhagen and was buried in the cemetery of Trinitatis Church.

==Works==
Wessel&#x27;s poems and plays are frequently satirical and humorous. His literary style is deliberate elaborate and digressive and at the same time elegant and witty. Another genre is the epigram that he mastered, especially his short, witty, impudent, precise and also self-ironic commemorative poems.

Wessel is known first of all for his many humorous and satiric verse tales referring to man&#x27;s foolishness and injustice. Most notable is &quot;Smeden og Bageren&quot; (&quot;The Smith and the Baker&quot;) about the only smith of a village who is pardoned for manslaughter since the village people need one, while a more superfluous baker is executed instead (there are two bakers, the village only needs one) in order to observe the rules that &quot;life pays life&quot;.

In &quot;Herremanden&quot; (&quot;The Squire&quot;) a man coming to Hell makes unpleasant discoveries of the origin of his own son while &quot;Hundemordet&quot; (&quot;The Dog Murder&quot;) tells about wrangle about trivial things.

His satirical play &quot;Kierlighed uden Strømper&quot; ( &quot;Love without Stockings&quot;, 1772—with epilogue, 1774) is a generic parody of neoclassical tragedy; it takes place in a daily milieu of banal conflicts but observes the formal rules of &quot;heroic language&quot;. It is still performed.

Another play &quot;Anno 7603&quot; was written in 1781. It has a low literary value, and it has never been performed—it is held in such low esteem that it is often omitted from lists of his works —but it has some cult status since this is one of the first examples of time travel in fiction. The main characters, Leander and Julie, are moved by a fairy to a future (AD 7603) in which gender roles have been switched and only women are allowed to fight in the military.

The traditional restaurant &quot;Wesselstuen&quot; in Bergen, Norway features many decorations inspired by his works.

<text>The Swedish Navy () is the maritime service branch of the Swedish Armed Forces. It is composed of surface and submarine naval units – the Fleet (), formally sometimes referred to as the Royal Navy () – as well as marine units, the Amphibious Corps ().

Founded under King Gustav Vasa in 1522, the Swedish navy is one of the oldest continuously serving navies in the world, celebrating its 500th anniversary in 2022.

==History==

Early Swedish kings ( 9th–14th centuries) organised a Swedish Navy along the coastline through . This involved combined rowing and sailing ships (without artillery). This system became obsolete with the development of society and changes in military technology. No later than in the 14th century, the duty to serve in was replaced by a tax. In 1427, when Sweden was still part of the Kalmar Union (with Denmark and Norway), Swedish warships did however participate in the naval battle of Öresund against the Hanseatic League. It is unclear how this force was organised and exactly on what basis.

On 7 June 1522, one year after the separation of Sweden from the Kalmar Union, Gustav Vasa purchased a number of ships from the Hanseatic town of Lübeck. Official Swedish histories since the 19th century have often recorded this day as the birth of the current Swedish Navy. The museum ship in Stockholm was a 17th-century ship of the Royal Swedish Navy ().

The Amphibious Corps dates back to 1 January 1902, when a separate &quot;Coastal Artillery&quot; () was established, and came into use as the name of the service as a whole. The last decade of the 20th century saw the abandonment of the coastal fortifications and the force became a more regular marine corps, renamed Amphibious Corps () in 2000.

For most of the twentieth century, the Swedish Navy focused on the threat of a full-scale invasion of Sweden via the Baltic Sea and on protecting commercial shipping. Sweden&#x27;s location on the Scandinavian peninsula makes it highly dependent of maritime trade: 90% imports and exports enter or leave Sweden through the Baltic. In 1972, the government decreed that non-military measures should be used to protect merchant shipping. The resolution led to the decommissioning of all the navy&#x27;s destroyers and frigates, though the non-military measures the government intended to use to protect shipping have never been specified.

The navy first participated in a UN-mandate international operation in Kosovo through KFOR, KS04 in 2001 by the amphibious corps. The fleet participated in its first UN operation UN-led peacekeeping mission in October 2006 when the corvette began performing coastal surveillance duties for the United Nations Mission in Lebanon. HSwMS &quot;Gävle&quot; was relieved by , which returned to Sweden in September 2007.

, , and took part in the EU-led EUNAVFOR operation (2008– ) off the coast of the Horn of Africa. In 2010, was the EUNAVFOR flagship, housing the fleet headquarters led by RAdm (LH) Jan Thörnqvist.

==Organization==
Until recently, the Navy was led by the Chief of the Navy, who was typically a vice admiral. This office has been eliminated, and the highest officer of the Navy is now the Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Johan Norlén, who is the senior representative of the Swedish Navy&#x27;s combat forces.

The Marine units use the same system of rank as the Army.

<doc id="198661" wikidata="Q1391553" url="?curid=198661" title="Witch of Endor">
<text>The Witch of Endor (), according to the Hebrew Bible, was consulted by Saul to summon the spirit of the prophet Samuel. Saul wished to receive advice on defeating the Philistines in battle after prior attempts to consult God through sacred lots and other means had failed. However, what was summoned (whether the actual ghost of Samuel or a spirit impersonating him) delivered a prophecy of doom against Saul and his army, who were defeated. This event occurs in 1 Samuel 28:3–25 and is also mentioned in the deuterocanonical Book of Sirach.

==Etymology==
The Hebrew Bible calls her &quot;a woman, possessor of an &quot;ʾōḇ&quot; at En Dor,&quot; apparently a settlement around a spring. The word &quot;ov&quot; has been suggested by Harry A. Hoffner to refer to a ritual pit for summoning the dead from the netherworld based on parallels in other Near Eastern and Mediterranean cultures. The word has cognates in other regional languages (cf. Sumerian &quot;ab&quot;, Akkadian &quot;âbu&quot;, Hittite &quot;a-a-bi&quot;, Ugaritic &quot;ib&quot;) and the medium or witch of Endor&#x27;s ritual has parallels in Mesopotamian and Hittite magical texts as well as the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

Other suggestions for a definition of &quot;ov&quot; include a familiar spirit, a talisman, or a wineskin, in reference to ventriloquism.

In the Septuagint, she is called the &quot;engastrímuthos&quot; &quot;belly-talker&quot; of Aendōr (). The Latin Vulgate has &quot;pythonem in Aendor&quot;, both terms referencing then-contemporary pagan oracles.

The medium says that she sees &quot;elohim arising&quot; from the ground, using the word typically translated as &quot;god(s)&quot; to refer to the spirit of the dead. This is also paralleled by the use of the Akkadian cognate word &quot;ilu&quot; &quot;god&quot; in a similar fashion.

==Biblical narrative==
When the prophet Samuel dies, he is buried in Rama (1 Samuel 25:1; 28:3). Saul, the King of Israel, seeks advice from God in choosing a course of action against the assembled forces of the Philistine army. He receives no answer from dreams, prophets, or the Urim and Thummim. Having previously driven out all necromancers and magicians from Israel, Saul searches for a witch anonymously. He is told one is living in the village of Endor. Saul disguises himself and crosses enemy lines to visit her, asking her to raise Samuel. The woman initially refuses because of Saul&#x27;s royal edict against sorcery, but Saul assures her that she will not be punished.

The woman summons a spirit, and when it appears, she works out who Saul is and screams, &quot;Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!&quot; Saul assures her that no harm will come to her and asks what she sees. She says she sees &quot;&quot;elohim&quot; rising&quot; (plural noun and verb). Then, Saul asks what &quot;he&quot; (singular) looks like, and she describes an old man wrapped in a robe. Saul bows down to the spirit but is unable to see it himself.

The spirit complains of being disturbed, berates Saul for disobeying God, and predicts Saul&#x27;s downfall. The living Samuel had already said Saul would have his kingship removed, but this spirit adds that Israel&#x27;s army will be defeated, and Saul and his sons will be &quot;with me&quot; tomorrow. Saul collapses in terror; the woman comforts him and prepares him a meal of a fatted calf to restore his strength.

The following day, the Israelite army is defeated as prophesied: Saul is wounded by the Philistines and commits suicide by falling on his sword. Later, a young Amalekite hoping to impress David will falsely claim he delivered the death blow, and David will execute him. In 1 Chronicles, it is stated that Saul&#x27;s death was in part a punishment for seeking advice from a medium rather than from God.

==Interpretations==
===Judaism===

In the Septuagint (2nd century BC), the woman is described as a ventriloquist, possibly reflecting the consistent view of the Alexandrian translators that demons do not exist. On the other hand, the Hebrew Book of Sirach, composed in the same period, represents it as a fact that Samuel prophesied to Saul after his death. Josephus, writing in the 1st century AD, also appears to find the story completely credible.

The &quot;Yalkut Shimoni&quot; (11th century) identifies the anonymous witch as the mother of Abner. Based upon the witch&#x27;s claim to have seen something, and Saul having heard a disembodied voice, the &quot;Yalkut&quot; suggests that necromancers can see the spirits of the dead but are unable to hear their speech, while the person for whom the deceased was summoned hears the voice but fails to see anything.

According to Antoine Augustin Calmet, writing in the 18th century:

===Christianity===
The Church Fathers and some modern Christian writers have debated the theological issues raised by this text, which would appear at first sight to affirm that it is possible (though forbidden) for humans to summon the spirits of the dead by magic.

King James, in his philosophical treatise &quot;Daemonologie&quot; (1597), rejected the theory that the witch was performing an act of ventriloquism, but also denied that she had truly summoned the spirit of Samuel. He wrote that the Devil is permitted at times to take on the likeness of the saints, citing 2 Corinthians 11:14, which says that &quot;Satan can transform himself into an Angel of light&quot;. James describes the witch of Endor as &quot;Saul&#x27;s Pythonese&quot;, likening her to the ancient Greek oracle Pythia. He asserts the reality of witchcraft, arguing that if such things were not possible, they would not be prohibited in Scripture:
Other medieval glosses to the Bible also suggested that what the witch summoned was not the ghost of Samuel, but a demon taking his shape or an illusion crafted by the witch. Martin Luther, who believed that the dead were unconscious, read that it was &quot;the Devil&#x27;s ghost&quot;, whereas John Calvin read that &quot;it was not the real Samuel, but a spectre.&quot;

Antoine Augustin Calmet briefly mentions the witch of Endor in his &quot;Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.&quot; (1759), among other scriptural proofs of &quot;the reality of magic.&quot; He acknowledges that this interpretation is disputed and says that he will deduce nothing from the passage &quot;except that this woman passed for a witch, [and] that Saul esteemed her such.&quot;

Since this passage states the witch made a loud cry in fear when she saw Samuel&#x27;s spirit, some interpreters reject the suggestion that the witch was responsible for summoning Samuel&#x27;s spirit, claiming instead that this was the work of God. Joyce Baldwin (1989) writes that the incident does not tell us anything about the veracity of claims to consult the dead on the part of mediums, because the indications [of the woman’s behavior] are that this was an extraordinary event for her, and a frightening one, because she was not in control.

Grenville Kent summarises two main historical interpretations: one, that Samuel really appeared, either bodily or in resurrected form; two, that Samuel was impersonated by a demon in order to destroy Saul. He argues that the latter view matches the text.

===Spiritualism===

Spiritualists have taken the story as evidence of spirit mediumship in ancient times. The story has been cited in debates between Spiritualist apologists and Christian critics. &quot;The woman of Endor was a medium, respectable, honest, law-abiding, and far more Christ-like than Christian critics of Spiritualism,&quot; asserted one Chicago Spiritualist paper in 1875.

==Cultural references==

The story of Saul&#x27;s consultation with the witch of Endor has frequently been set to music, with many works expanding on the character of the witch. One early example is &quot;In guiltie night&quot;, an oratorio written by Robert Ramsey in the 1630s, which formed the basis of a better-known work of the same title by Henry Purcell in 1691.

The witch also appears in &quot;Mors Saulis et Jonathae&quot; by Charpentier (c. 1682), &quot;Saul&quot; by George Frideric Handel (1738), &quot;Die Könige in Israel&quot; by Ferdinand Ries (1837), and &quot;Le Roi David&quot; by Honegger (1921). Notable operas featuring the character include &quot;David et Jonathas&quot; by Charpentier (1688) and &quot;Saul og David&quot; by Carl Nielsen (1902). In 1965, the Martha Graham Dance Company premiered &quot;The Witch of Endor&quot;, a one act ballet with music by William Schuman; this was subsequently reworked into a short piece by American composer Moondog (Louis Hardin) for his 1969 self-titled album.

Poetic works retelling the story include &quot;&quot; by Lord Byron, published in his 1815 collection &quot;Hebrew Melodies&quot;, and &quot;In Endor&quot; by Shaul Tchernichovsky (1893), a major work of modern Hebrew poetry which paints Saul as a sympathetic figure. Rudyard Kipling, a year after the death of his son at the Battle of Loos, wrote a poem called &quot;&quot;, using the story to criticise contemporary mediums.

In theatre, the witch of Endor figures in Laurence Housman&#x27;s 1944 play &quot;Samuel the Kingmaker&quot;, and has a central role in Howard Nemerov&#x27;s 1961 play &quot;Endor&quot;. The character has been portrayed cinematically by Israeli actor Dov Reiser in the 1976 television film &quot;The Story of David&quot;, and by Belgian actress Lyne Renée in the 2016 series &quot;Of Kings and Prophets&quot;.

The character of Endora, the mother of the heroine Samantha on the television show &quot;Bewitched&quot;, may be named for the Witch of Endor.

&quot;The Witch of Endor&quot; is a name occasionally given to ships, both real and in fiction, such as in the Horatio Hornblower novels and the Sci Fi series &quot;The Expanse&quot;.

In music, the Witch of Endor is mentioned in the last verse of the song &quot;Lover, Leaver&quot; by Greta Van Fleet.

The Witch of Endor is also a plot point in &quot;The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel&quot; by Michael Scott.

<text>Agitprop (; from , portmanteau of &quot;agitatsiya&quot;, &quot;agitation&quot; and &quot;propaganda&quot;, &quot;propaganda&quot;) refers to an intentional, vigorous promulgation of ideas. The term originated in the Soviet Union where it referred to popular media, such as literature, plays, pamphlets, films, and other art forms, with an explicitly political message in favor of communism.

The term originated in the Soviet Union as a shortened name for the Department for Agitation and Propaganda (, &quot;&quot;), which was part of the central and regional committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Within the party apparatus, both agitation (work among people who were not Communists) and propaganda (political work among party members) were the responsibility of the &quot;agitpropotdel&quot;, or APPO. Its head was a member of the MK secretariat, although they ranked second to the head of the &quot;orgraspredotdel&quot;. Typically Russian agitprop explained the ideology and policies of the Communist Party and attempted to persuade the general public to support and join the party and share its ideals. Agitprop was also used for dissemination of information and knowledge to the people, like new methods of agriculture. After the October Revolution of 1917, an agitprop train toured the country, with artists and actors performing simple plays and broadcasting propaganda. It had a printing press on board the train to allow posters to be reproduced and thrown out of the windows as it passed through villages. The first head of the Propaganda and Agitation Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (b) was Evgeny Preobrazhensky.

It gave rise to agitprop theatre, a highly politicized theatre that originated in 1920s Europe and spread to the United States; the plays of Bertolt Brecht are a notable example. Russian agitprop theater was noted for its cardboard characters of perfect virtue and complete evil, and its coarse ridicule. Gradually, the term &quot;agitprop&quot; came to describe any kind of highly politicized art.

==Forms==
During the Russian Civil War agitprop took various forms:

*Use of the press: Bolshevik strategy from the beginning was to gain access to the primary medium of dissemination of information in Russia: the press. The socialist newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; resurfaced in 1917 after being shut down by the Tsarist censorship three years earlier. Prominent Bolsheviks like Kamenev, Stalin and Bukharin became editors of &quot;Pravda&quot; during and after the revolution, making it an organ for Bolshevik agitprop. With the decrease in popularity and power of Tsarist and Bourgeois press outlets, &quot;Pravda&quot; was able to become the dominant source of written information for the population in regions controlled by the Red Army .

*Oral-agitation networks: The Bolshevik leadership understood that to build a lasting regime, they would need to win the support of the mass population of Russian peasants. To do this, Lenin organized a Communist party that attracted demobilized soldiers and others to become supporters of the Bolshevik ideology, dressed up in uniforms and sent to travel the countryside as agitators to the peasants. The oral-agitation networks established a presence in the isolated rural areas of Russia, expanding Communist power.
*Agitational trains and ships: To expand the reach of the oral-agitation networks, the Bolsheviks pioneered using modern transportation to reach deeper into Russia. The trains and ships carried agitators armed with leaflets, posters, and various other forms of agitprop. Train cars included a garage of motorcycles and cars in order for propaganda materials to reach the rural towns not located near rail lines. The agitational trains expanded the reach of agitators into Eastern Europe and allowed for the establishment of agitprop stations, consisting of libraries of propaganda material. The trains were also equipped with radios, and their own printing press, so they could report to Moscow the political climate of the given region, and receive instruction on how to custom print propaganda on the spot to better take advantage of the situation.
*Literacy campaign: The peasant society of Russia in 1917 was largely illiterate, making it difficult to reach them through printed agitprop. The People&#x27;s Commissariat of Enlightenment was established to spearhead the war on illiteracy. Instructors were trained in 1919 and sent to the countryside to create more instructors and expand the operation into a network of literacy centers. New textbooks were created, explaining Bolshevik ideology to the newly literate members of Soviet society, and the literacy training in the army was expanded.

<text>USS &quot;Ellyson&quot; (DD-454/DMS-19), a , is the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Theodore Gordon Ellyson, a submariner who became the first officer of the U.S. Navy to be designated a naval aviator.
==Service history==
&quot;Ellyson&quot; was laid down by Federal Shipbuilding of Kearny, New Jersey on 20 December 1940. She was launched on 26 July 1941 sponsored by Miss Gordon Ellyson, daughter of Commander Ellyson, and commissioned on 28 November 1941.

===1942===
Still outfitting when the United States entered World War II, &quot;Ellyson&quot; was quickly readied for sea and patrolled in the Atlantic, protecting Allied shipping from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to the West Indies and Panama Canal. On 14 January 1942 she rescued 24 survivors from the sunken Norwegian SS &quot;Norness&quot;. On 15 June she broke the pennant of Commander, Destroyer Squadron 10, which she was to carry proudly through the war, through the squadron&#x27;s redesignation to Mine Division 20 and the subsequent conversion of its destroyers to high-speed minesweepers.

In August 1942 &quot;Ellyson&quot; began operating with the aircraft carrier , and remained with her through the landings at Fedhala, French Morocco, on 8 November. After two months of escort duty along the east coast, she rejoined &quot;Ranger&quot; on two voyages to Casablanca to ferry Army planes to north Africa.

===1943===
On 5 April 1943 &quot;Ellyson&quot; arrived at NS Argentia, Dominion of Newfoundland, to prepare for operations with the Royal Navy. She sailed for England on 12 May in the screen of the battleships and , and operated with the British Home Fleet out of Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands screening convoys, giving distant support to Allied shipping to Murmansk and Iceland, and attempting to lure German battleship and other German surface ships from the safety of Norwegian bases to battle on the open seas. In July she took part in a feint invasion of southern Norway to distract German attention from the real assault on Sicily.

Returning to Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 August 1943, &quot;Ellyson&quot; screened during the battleship&#x27;s shakedown cruise off Argentina, then returned to Norfolk with her on 24 October. On 3 November &quot;Ellyson&quot; sailed in the scouting line for &quot;Iowa&quot; who was carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the Teheran Conference. Later, moving into the battleship&#x27;s screen, &quot;Ellyson&quot; touched Bahia, Brazil; Freetown, Sierra Leone, Dakar, and Port Royal, South Carolina; before returning to Boston, Massachusetts, on 19 December.

===1944===
On 6 January 1944 &quot;Ellyson&quot; once again joined &quot;Ranger&quot; for screen and plane guard duty in Narragansett Bay. She sailed for north Africa 19 April and arrived at Oran on 1 May. On the 16th while hunting submarines &quot;Ellyson&quot; made contact on , touching off an intensive coordinated air-sea hunt. The submarine surfaced at 23:58, and soon dived after a brief duel with . &quot;Ellyson&quot; and continued the attack with depth charges, forcing &quot;U-616&quot; to surface again. &quot;Ellyson&quot; sank her with gunfire on the morning of the 17th, then rescued 30 survivors.

&quot;Ellyson&quot; arrived at Plymouth, on 22 May 1944 for last-minute preparations for the invasion of France. On 6 June she covered the Army Ranger assault on Pointe du Hoc to knock out the heavy gun emplacements reported there. On 25 June she saw action off Cherbourg, blasting gun installations, destroying naval mines, and laying a smoke screen for larger fleet units.

&quot;Ellyson&quot; sailed from Portland Harbour on 29 June 1944, to invade southern France on 15 August. She led the destroyer fires support group in directly behind the minesweepers and knocked out defenses for the incoming troops. On patrol on 27 August she illuminated a suspicious fishing vessel and captured it, finding 50 German submariners trying to escape. &quot;Ellyson&quot; remained on patrol to cover the landing of reinforcements and support the invasion until October, then sailed for Boston, arriving 8 November to begin conversion to a high-speed minesweeper. She was reclassified to hull classification symbol DMS-19 on 15 November 1944.

===1945===
After training in Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Ellyson&quot; sailed from Norfolk, on 3 January 1945 for the Pacific. On 24 March she arrived off Okinawa with the rest of her squadron to sweep in advance of the invasion. After thus making possible the pre-assault bombardment, she supported smaller minesweepers clearing approaches to the beaches and inner harbors. After the landings of 1 April &quot;Ellyson&quot; joined the radar picket line. The varied and dangerous duties assigned her squadron in the Okinawa operation took a heavy toll, only three of the 12 ships with whom she sailed in the next three months survived undamaged. &quot;Ellyson&quot; went to the aid of her sister ship on 6 April, attempting to tow the abandoned &quot;kamikaze&quot; victim. Flames and the threat of a magazine explosion forced &quot;Ellyson&quot; to sink the stricken destroyer early on 7 April to prevent her drifting on to Japanese-held Ie Shima. &quot;Ellyson&quot; herself was attacked several times and accounted for a number of Japanese planes.

In July 1945 &quot;Ellyson&quot; became flagship for the task group sweeping the East China Sea. Upon the ceasefire, she joined Third Fleet off Tokyo Bay and cleared it for the incoming occupation fleet units. In September she returned to Okinawa, and from her base at Buckner Bay, served as command ship for clearing the Inland Sea. She sailed from Japan on 5 December for Norfolk, arriving 5 January 1946.

===Post war===

&quot;Ellyson&quot; remained in the Atlantic, based at Charleston, South Carolina, primarily, for training as far as the Caribbean Sea. In 1948 she was immobilized at Charleston, resumed operations that November when she sailed to Argentia to sweep for an amphibious exercise. Attached to Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Ellyson&quot; continued to operate from Charleston on training duty along the east coast and in the Caribbean. She served in the Mediterranean with the Sixth Fleet in 1949, 1951, and 1953. On 4 May 1954 her hull classification symbol reverted to DD-454.

===Japanese service===

She was decommissioned 19 October 1954, and transferred to the Japanese Government on 20 October 1954 under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. She served in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force as Asakaze.

In 1970 the ship was returned to the United States, and was sold to Taiwan, where she was cannibalized for spare parts.

==Awards==
&quot;Ellyson&quot; received seven battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="198667" wikidata="Q1780250" url="?curid=198667" title="Rancid (2000 album)">
<text>Rancid (also known as Rancid 5 or Rancid 2000 to avoid confusion with their debut album) is the fifth studio album by the American punk rock band Rancid, released on August 1, 2000. It is the second eponymous album and the first to be released through frontman Tim Armstrong&#x27;s label, Hellcat Records. It also features the return of producer Brett Gurewitz, who has produced every subsequent album by the band.

==Production and composition==
Recording concluded in April 2000.

It is Rancid&#x27;s most hardcore offering to date, which was released as a follow-up to the more ska and reggae oriented &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot;. It spans 22 tracks in under 40 minutes, owing to over 3/4 of the songs clocking at under 2 minutes. The Japanese version includes one bonus track, &quot;Sick Sick World&quot;. Songs on the album make reference to famous gangster Al Capone, as well as Norse God Loki, John Brown, Ulysses S. Grant, Nelson Mandela, Charles Van Doren, Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; and Don Giovanni. Brett Gurewitz (Bad Religion) reunited with Rancid and became their producer for this album. It was 6 years since he co-produced the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; (1994), although he engineered the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot; (1995). Rancid and Gurewitz would continue their collaboration for their next five albums, &quot;Indestructible&quot;, &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot;, &quot;Honor Is All We Know&quot;, &quot;Trouble Maker&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;. 

On the record released to the public, there was a mastering error on the track &quot;Poison&quot; on the first run of CDs pressed, but was fixed in subsequent pressings and is not present on the vinyl copies of the record.

==Release==
&quot;Disgruntled&quot; was posted on the band&#x27;s website on June 3, 2000. A joint music video for &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;Disgruntled&quot; was directed by Tim Armstrong. Shortly after this, a demo version of &quot;Poison&quot; was released on &quot;Punk-O-Rama 5&quot;. &quot;Let Me Go&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lone official single while &quot;Radio Havana&quot; was released as a promotional single. Music videos for &quot;Let Me Go&quot;, &quot;GGF (Golden Gate Fields)&quot;, &quot;Young Al Capone&quot;, &quot;I Am Forever&quot;, &quot;Dead Bodies&quot;, &quot;Rwanda&quot;, &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot;, &quot;Black Derby Jacket&quot;, &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;, &quot;Poison&quot; and &quot;Loki&quot; were also released.

After being planned for release in May 2000, &quot;Rancid&quot; was eventually released on August 1, 2000. In November, the band embarked on tour of the US, with support from AFI and the Distillers. Between June and August 2001, the group performed on the Warped Tour. Following this, the band appeared at the Reading and Leeds Festivals.

==Reception==
The album received mostly positive reviews, though it failed to meet the success of Rancid&#x27;s three previous albums. Rick Anderson of AllMusic noted &quot;After several fine, if rather derivative, albums of ska-inflected punk rock, and after years of being criticized for relying unduly on gestures lifted from the Clash, Rancid has come roaring out with the harshest and most consistent album of their career. It wouldn&#x27;t be entirely accurate to say that they&#x27;ve left their influences behind; rather, they&#x27;ve integrated them more completely and created a sound that is completely satisfying without having to prove anything about its own originality. That sound ends up being something like a cross between the Clash circa 1978 and the hardcore punk of the early-&#x27;80s Los Angeles scene. &quot;Rwanda&quot; is a stutter-step anthem of sympathy for a devastated country; &quot;Corruption&quot; has an atonal power-chord progression and headlong tempo that Minor Threat would have killed for; and &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; is built on a ridiculously catchy descending bassline and a distinctly Oi!-flavored singalong chorus. No ska, no reggae, no dub, just 22 tracks in 38 minutes with barely a pause between songs and high tempos all the way. If you&#x27;re looking for artistic subtlety, go back to the catalog; if all you need is a half-hour of undiluted adrenaline, you&#x27;ve come to the right place.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; gave the album a rating of three out of five, referring to the album as &quot;infectious as they are insufferable&quot;.

<doc id="198668" wikidata="Q331905" url="?curid=198668" title="Abolition of the han system">
<text>The in the Empire of Japan and its replacement by a system of prefectures in 1871 was the culmination of the Meiji Restoration begun in 1868, the starting year of the Meiji period. Under the reform, all daimyos (, &quot;daimyō&quot;, feudal lords) were required to return their authority to the Emperor Meiji and his house. The process was accomplished in several stages, resulting in a new centralized government of Meiji Japan and the replacement of the old feudal system with a new oligarchy.

==Boshin War==
After the defeat of forces loyal to the Tokugawa shogunate during the Boshin War in 1868, the new Meiji government confiscated all lands formerly under direct control of the Shogunate (&quot;tenryō&quot;) and lands controlled by daimyos who remained loyal to the Tokugawa cause. These lands accounted for approximately a quarter of the land area of Japan and were reorganized into prefectures with governors appointed directly by the central government.

==Return of the domains==
The second phase in the abolition of the &quot;han&quot; came in 1869. The movement was spearheaded by Kido Takayoshi of the Chōshū Domain, with the backing of court nobles Iwakura Tomomi and Sanjō Sanetomi. Kido persuaded the lords of Chōshū and of Satsuma, the two leading domains in the overthrow of the Tokugawa, to voluntarily surrender their domains to the Emperor. Between July 25, 1869, and August 2, 1869, fearing that their loyalty would be questioned, the daimyos of 260 other domains followed suit. Only 14 domains failed to initially comply voluntarily with the , and were then ordered to do so by the Court, under the threat of military action.

In return for surrendering their hereditary authority to the central government, the daimyos were re-appointed as non-hereditary governors of their former domains (which were renamed as prefectures), and were allowed to keep ten percent of the tax revenues, based on actual rice production (which was greater than the nominal rice production upon which their feudal obligations under the Shogunate were formerly based).

As governors, the former daimyos could name subordinates, but only if the subordinates met qualification levels established by the central government. Furthermore, hereditary stipends to their samurai retainers were paid out of the prefectural office by the central government, and not directly by the governor, a move calculated to further weaken the traditional feudal ties.

The term &quot;daimyō&quot; was abolished in July 1869 as well, with the formation of the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system.

==Consolidation==
Although the former daimyos had become government employees, they still retained a measure of military and fiscal independence, and enjoyed the customary veneration of their former subjects. This was considered an increasing threat to central authority by Ōkubo Toshimichi and other members of the new Meiji oligarchy, especially with the large number of ex-samurai revolts occurring around the country. In August 1871, Okubo, assisted by Saigō Takamori, Kido Takayoshi, Iwakura Tomomi and Yamagata Aritomo, forced through an Imperial Edict which reorganized the 261 surviving ex-feudal domains into three urban prefectures (&quot;fu&quot;) and 302 prefectures (&quot;ken&quot;). The number was then reduced through consolidation the following year to three urban prefectures and 72 prefectures, and later to the present three urban prefectures and 44 prefectures by 1888.

The central government accomplished this reorganization by promising the former daimyos a generous stipend, absorbing the domain&#x27;s debts, and promising to convert the domain currency (&quot;hansatsu&quot;) to the new national currency at face value. The central treasury proved unable to support such generosity, so in 1874, the ex-daimyōs&#x27; stipend was transformed into government bonds with a face value equivalent to five years&#x27; worth of stipends, and paying five percent interest per year. Samurai serving former daimyos also received tradable government bonds of former salary dependent value. The owners of the bonds received interest until the bonds were reimbursed, which was decided by annual lottery. In 30 years, all bonds for samurais were reimbursed.

Makino Nobuaki, a student member of the Iwakura Mission, remarked in his memoirs: &quot;Together with the abolition of the han system, dispatching the Iwakura Mission to America and Europe must be cited as the most important events that built the foundation of our state after the Restoration.&quot;

<text>Avid Technology, Inc. is a global technology company headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, and was founded in August 1987 by Bill Warner. It develops software, SaaS, and hardware products used in media and entertainment. 

Avid products and workflow solutions are used extensively in Hollywood and the film industry; in the broadcast television and streaming media industry; and the music industry. It is known for its video editing software, audio editing software, music notation software and media management and distribution services. 

== Products ==
Avid&#x27;s software and hardware are used by companies and individuals in the media and entertainment industry.

==History==
Avid was founded by Bill Warner, a former marketing manager from Apollo Computer. 

A prototype of their first non-linear editing system, the Avid/1 Media Composer, was shown at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) convention in April 1988. The Avid/1 was based on an Apple Macintosh II computer, with special hardware and software of Avid&#x27;s design installed.
The Avid/1 was &quot;the biggest shake-up in editing since Melies played with time and sequences in the early 1900s&quot;. 

By the early 1990s, Avid products began to replace such tools as the Moviola, Steenbeck, and KEM flatbed editors, allowing editors to handle their film creations with greater ease. The first feature film edited using the Avid was &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill All the Lawyers&quot; in 1992, directed by Ron Senkowski. The film was edited at a 30fps NTSC rate, then used Avid MediaMatch to generate a negative cutlist from the EDL. The first feature film edited natively at 24fps with what was to become the Avid Film Composer was &quot;Emerson Park&quot;. The first studio film to be edited at 24fps was &quot;Lost in Yonkers&quot;, directed by Martha Coolidge. 

By 1994 only three feature films used the new digital editing system. By 1995 dozens had switched to Avid, and it signaled the beginning of the end of cutting celluloid. In 1996 Walter Murch accepted the Academy Award for editing &quot;The English Patient&quot; (which also won best picture), which he cut on the Avid. This was the first Editing Oscar awarded to a digitally edited film (although the final print was still created with traditional negative cutting).

In 1994 Avid introduced Open Media Framework (OMF) as an open standard file format for sharing media and related metadata.

Over the years, Avid has released numerous freeware versions of Media Composer. Initially this included Avid Free DV: a free edition of Media Composer with limited functionality; Avid Xpress DV: a consumer edition of Media Composer; and then Avid Xpress Pro: a prosumer edition of Media Composer. These editions were discontinued in 2008 as the flagship Media Composer was lowered in price. Later, Avid released Media Composer | First, which included a large portion of Media Composer&#x27;s functionality but its exporting workflows publishing finished videos directly to web services like YouTube. 

On March 29, 1999, Avid Technology, Inc. adjusted the amount originally allocated to IPR&amp;D and restated its third-quarter 1998 consolidated financial statements accordingly, considering the SEC&#x27;s views.

In 2006, Avid entered the shared storage market with Interplay and Unity. Combined with Media Composer, this became a milestone workflow for network television and film studios.

In February 2018, Avid appointed Jeff Rosica as CEO, after terminating Louis Hernandez Jr, who was accused of workplace misconduct.

In November 2023, Avid Technology was acquired by an affiliate of STG for $1.4 billion. This process delisted Avid from the public stock exchange, making it private. 

In April 2024, Avid appointed Wellford Dillard as CEO, succeeding Jeff Rosica.

<text>Ultrix (officially all-caps ULTRIX) is the brand name of Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s (DEC) discontinued native Unix operating systems for the PDP-11, VAX, MicroVAX and DECstations.

==History==
The initial development of Unix occurred on DEC equipment, notably DEC PDP-7 and PDP-11 (Programmable Data Processor) systems. Later DEC computers, such as their VAX, also offered Unix. The first port to VAX, UNIX/32V, was finished in 1978, not long after the October 1977 announcement of the VAX, for which – at that time – DEC only supplied its own proprietary operating system, VMS.

DEC&#x27;s Unix Engineering Group (UEG) was started by Bill Munson with Jerry Brenner and Fred Canter, both from DEC&#x27;s Customer Service Engineering group, Bill Shannon (from Case Western Reserve University), and Armando Stettner (from Bell Labs). Other later members of UEG included Joel Magid, Bill Doll, and Jim Barclay recruited from DEC&#x27;s marketing and product management groups.

Under Canter&#x27;s direction, UEG released V7M, a modified version of Unix 7th Edition (q.v.).

In 1988 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Ultrix was POSIX compliant.

===BSD===
Shannon and Stettner worked on low-level CPU and device driver support initially on UNIX/32V but quickly moved to concentrate on working with the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s 4BSD. Berkeley&#x27;s Bill Joy came to New Hampshire to work with Shannon and Stettner to wrap up a new BSD release. UEG&#x27;s machine was the first to run the new Unix, labeled 4.5BSD as was the tape Bill Joy took with him. The thinking was that 5BSD would be the next version - university lawyers thought it would be better to call it 4.1BSD. After the completion of 4.1BSD, Bill Joy left Berkeley to work at Sun Microsystems. Shannon later moved from New Hampshire to join him. Stettner stayed at DEC and later conceived of and started the Ultrix project.

Shortly after IBM announced plans for a native UNIX product, Stettner and Bill Doll presented plans for DEC to make a native VAX Unix product available to its customers; DEC founder Ken Olsen agreed.

===V7m===
DEC&#x27;s first native UNIX product was V7M (for modified) or V7M11 for the PDP-11 and was based on Version 7 Unix from Bell Labs. V7M was developed by DEC&#x27;s original Unix Engineering Group (UEG); work was done primarily by Fred Canter and Jerry Brenner, with their teammates Stettner, Bill Burns, Mary Anne Cacciola, and Bill Munson. V7M contained many fixes to the kernel including support for separate instruction and data spaces, significant work for hardware error recovery, and many device drivers. Much work was put into producing a release that would reliably bootstrap from many tape drives or disk drives. V7M was well respected in the Unix community. UEG evolved into the group that later developed Ultrix.

===First release of Ultrix===
The first native VAX UNIX product from DEC was Ultrix-32, based on 4.2BSD with some non-kernel features from System V, and was released in June 1984. Ultrix-32 was primarily the brainchild of Armando Stettner. It provided a Berkeley-based native VAX Unix on a broad array of hardware configurations without the need to access kernel sources. A further goal was to enable better support by DEC&#x27;s field software and systems support engineers through better hardware support, system messages, and documentation. It also incorporated several modifications and scripts from Usenet/UUCP experience. Later, Ultrix-32 incorporated support for DECnet and other proprietary DEC protocols such as LAT. It did not support VAXclustering. Given Western Electric/AT&amp;T Unix licensing, DEC (and others) were restricted to selling binary-only licenses. A significant part of the engineering work was in making the systems relatively flexible and configurable despite their binary-only nature.

DEC provided Ultrix on three platforms: PDP-11 minicomputers (where Ultrix was one of many available operating systems from DEC), VAX-based computers (where Ultrix was one of two primary OS choices) and the Ultrix-only DECstation workstations and DECsystem servers. Note that the DECstation and the later DECsystem products (as opposed to DEC&#x27;s original DECsystem line) used MIPS processors and predate the much later Alpha-based systems.

===Later releases of Ultrix===
The V7m product was later renamed to &quot;Ultrix-11&quot; to establish the family with &quot;Ultrix-32&quot;, but as the PDP-11 faded from view Ultrix-32 became known simply as &quot;Ultrix&quot;. When the MIPS versions of Ultrix was released, the VAX and MIPS versions were referred to as VAX/ULTRIX and RISC/ULTRIX respectively. Much engineering emphasis was placed on supportability and reliable operations including continued work on CPU and device driver support (which was, for the most part, also sent to UC Berkeley), hardware failure support and recovery with enhancement to error message text, documentation, and general work at both the kernel and systems program levels. Later Ultrix-32 incorporated some features from 4.3BSD and optionally included DECnet and SNA in addition to the standard TCP/IP, and both the SMTP and DEC&#x27;s Mail-11 protocols.

Notably, Ultrix implemented the inter-process communication (IPC) facilities found in System V (named pipes, messages, semaphores, and shared memory). While the converged Unix from the Sun and AT&amp;T alliance (that spawned the Open Software Foundation or OSF), released late 1986, put BSD features into System V, DEC, as described in Stettner&#x27;s original Ultrix plans, took the best from System V and added it to a BSD base.

Originally, on the VAX workstations, Ultrix-32 had a desktop environment called UWS, Ultrix Worksystem Software, which was based on X10 and the Ultrix Window Manager. Later, the widespread version 11 of the X Window System (X11) was added, using a window manager and widget toolkit named XUI (X User Interface), which was also used on VMS releases of the time. Eventually Ultrix also provided the Motif toolkit and Motif Window Manager.

Ultrix ran on multiprocessor systems from both the VAX and DECsystem families. Ultrix-32 supported SCSI disks and tapes and also proprietary Digital Storage Systems Interconnect and CI peripherals employing DEC&#x27;s Mass Storage Control Protocol, although lacking the OpenVMS distributed lock manager it did not support concurrent access from multiple Ultrix systems. DEC also released a combination hardware and software product named Prestoserv which accelerated NFS file serving to allow better performance for diskless workstations to communicate to a file serving Ultrix host. The kernel supported symmetric multiprocessing while not being fully multithreaded based upon pre-Ultrix work by Armando Stettner and earlier work by George H. Goble at Purdue University. As such, there was liberal use of locking and some tasks could only be done by particular CPUs (e.g. the processing of interrupts). This was not uncommon in other SMP implementations of that time (e.g. SunOS). Also, Ultrix was slow to support many then new or emerging Unix system capabilities found on competing Unix systems (e.g. it never supported shared libraries or dynamically linked executables); and a delay in implementing bind, 4.3BSD system calls and libraries. The absence of memory-mapped file support was regarded as a particular deficiency with Ultrix in comparison to its competitors in the early 1990s.

===Last release===
As part of its commitment to the OSF, Armando Stettner went to DEC&#x27;s Cambridge Research Labs to work on the port of OSF/1 to DEC&#x27;s RISC-based DECstation 3100 workstation. This was released in 1991 with a Mach-based kernel for the MIPS architecture. A port of Ultrix to Alpha was carried out during the initial development of the Alpha architecture, but was never released as a product. Later, DEC replaced Ultrix with OSF/1 on Alpha, ending Unix development on the MIPS and VAX platforms.

The last major release of Ultrix was version 4.5 in 1995, which supported all previously supported DECstations and VAXen. There were some subsequent Y2K patches.

==Application software==
WordMARC, a scientifically oriented word processor, was among the application packages available for Ultrix.

The following shells were provided with Ultrix:

<text>Bentley Systems, Incorporated is an American-based software development company that develops, manufactures, licenses, sells and supports computer software and services for the design, construction, and operation of infrastructure. The company&#x27;s software serves the building, plant, civil, and geospatial markets in the areas of architecture, engineering, construction (AEC) and operations. Their software products are used to design, engineer, build, and operate large constructed assets such as roadways, railways, bridges, buildings, industrial plants, power plants, and utility networks. The company re-invests 20% of their revenues in research and development.

Bentley Systems is headquartered in Exton, Pennsylvania, United States, but has development, sales and other departments in over 50 countries. In 2021, the company generated revenue of $1 billion in 186 countries.

==Software==

Bentley has three principal software product lines: MicroStation, ProjectWise, and AssetWise. Since 2014, some products have been based on the Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://mspoweruser.com/bentley-systems-uses-microsoft-azure-cloud-services-to-advance-infrastructure/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2024, it continues to sell software lines such as MicroStation and ProjectWise, as well as several dozen others such as SYNCHRO and OpenRoads Designer.

==History==

Keith A. Bentley and Barry J. Bentley founded Bentley Systems in 1984. They introduced the commercial version of PseudoStation in 1985, which allowed users of Intergraph&#x27;s VAX systems to use low-cost graphics terminals to view and modify the designs on their Intergraph IGDS (Interactive Graphics Design System) installations. Their first product was shown to potential users who were polled as to what they would be willing to pay for it. They averaged the answers, arriving at a price of $7,943. A DOS-based version of MicroStation was introduced in 1986.

In April 2002, Bentley filed for an initial public offering, but it was withdrawn before taking effect. In November 2016, German-based Siemens announced it would pay about $76 million for a minority stake in Bentley, as well as invest in developing joint software with it. In September 2020, Bentley Systems sets terms of its IPO valuing the company at about $4.96 billion. The company would offer 10.75 million shares priced between $17 and $19 per share. In October 2024, Bentley Systems began using Google 2D and 3D geospatial content in some of its software. Nicholas Cumins was Bentley chief officer.

<text>The Linotype machine ( ) is a &quot;line casting&quot; machine used in printing which is manufactured and sold by the former Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast lines of metal type for one-time use. Linotype became one of the mainstays for typesetting, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines, and posters from the late 19th century to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting and digital typesetting. The name of the machine comes from producing an entire line of metal type at once, hence a &quot;line-o&#x27;-type&quot;. It was a significant improvement over the previous industry standard of letter-by-letter manual typesetting using a composing stick and shallow subdivided trays, called &quot;cases&quot;.

The Linotype machine operator enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles &quot;matrices&quot;, or molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then cast as a single piece, called a &quot;slug&quot;, from molten type metal in a process known as hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine, to be reused continuously. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast sort (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.

The machine revolutionized typesetting and with it newspaper publishing, making it possible for a relatively small number of operators to set type for many pages daily. Ottmar Mergenthaler invented the Linotype in 1884 alongside James Ogilvie Clephane, who provided the financial backing for commercialization.

== History ==

In 1876, a German clock maker, Ottmar Mergenthaler, who had emigrated to the United States in 1872, was approached by James O. Clephane and his associate Charles T. Moore, who sought a quicker way of publishing legal briefs. By 1884, he conceived the idea of assembling metallic letter molds, called &quot;matrices&quot;, and casting molten metal into them, all within a single machine. His first attempt proved the idea feasible and a new company was formed. Improving his invention, Mergenthaler further developed his idea of an independent matrix machine. In July, 1886, the first commercially used Linotype was installed in the printing office of the New York Tribune. Here, it was immediately used on the daily paper and a large book. The book, the first ever composed with the new Linotype method, was titled &quot;The Tribune Book of Open-Air Sports&quot;.

Initially, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company was the only company (led by Ottmar Mergenthaler and eventually also James O. Clephane) producing linecasting machines, but in time, other companies would begin manufacturing similar machines. The Intertype Company produced the Intertype, a machine closely resembling the Linotype, using the same matrices as the Linotype, which started production around 1914. Where Mergenthaler prided themselves on intricately formed cast-iron parts on their machine, Intertype machined many of their similar parts from steel and aluminum.

Major newspaper publishers retired Linotype and similar &quot;hot metal&quot; typesetting machines during the 1970s and 1980s, replacing them with phototypesetting equipment and later computerized typesetting and page composition systems. , the last-known newspaper still using Linotype in the United States is &quot;The Saguache Crescent&quot;. is the last one in Western Europe.

== Overview ==

The linotype machine consists of four major sections:

# Magazine
# Keyboard
# Casting mechanism
# Distribution mechanism

The operator interacts with the machine via the keyboard, composing lines of text. The other sections are automatic; they start as soon as a line is completely composed.

Some Linotype machines included a paper tape reader. This also allowed the text to be typeset to be supplied over a telegraph line (TeleTypeSetter). Perforator operators produced paper tape text at a much higher speed which then was cast by more productive tape-controlled Linotype machines.

== Design ==

=== Matrices ===
Each matrix contains the letter form for a single character of a font of type; i.e., a particular type face in a particular size. The letter forms are engraved into one side of the matrix. For sizes up to 14 points, and in some matrices of size 16 to 24 points, the matrix has two letter forms on it, the normal and auxiliary positions. The normal position has the upright (Roman) form of a given character, and on the auxiliary, the slanted (&quot;Italic&quot;) form of that character will be used, but this can also be the boldface form or even a different font entirely. The machine operator can select which of the two faces will be cast by operating the &quot;auxiliary rail&quot; of the &quot;assembler&quot;, or, when setting entire lines of italics, by using the &quot;flap&quot;, which is a piece that can be turned under a portion of the first elevator column. This is the origin of the old typesetting terms &quot;upper rail&quot; for italic and &quot;lower rail&quot; for Roman characters. These terms have persisted in phototypesetting technology even though the mechanics of the auxiliary rail do not exist there. The character on a Linotype matrix, when viewed, is not inverted as a letter for conventional movable type would be, and the letter is incised below the surface rather than raised above it. This is because the matrix is not used directly to print onto the paper—rather, it is used as part of a mold from which a metal slug will be cast. The slug has its features reversed: therefore, the matrix does not.

=== Magazine section ===

The magazine section is the part of the machine where the matrices are held when not in use, and released as the operator touches keys on the keyboard. The magazine is a flat box with vertical separators that form &quot;channels&quot;, one channel for each character in the font. Most main magazines have 90 channels, but those for larger fonts carried only 72 or even 55 channels. The auxiliary magazines used on some machines typically contained 34 channels or, for a magazine carrying larger fonts, 28 channels.

The magazine holds a particular font of type; i.e., a particular type design in a particular size. If a different size or style was needed, the operator would switch to a different magazine. Many models of the Linotype machine could keep several magazines (as many as four) available at a time. In some of these, the operator could shift to a different magazine by raising or lowering the stack of magazines with a crank. Such machines would not allow mixing fonts within a single line. Others, such as the Models 25 and 26 allowed arbitrary mixing of text from two magazines within the same line, and the Model 9 extended this capability to mixing from up to four magazines within a single line.

==== Escapement ====
In a linotype machine, the term &quot;escapements&quot; refers to the mechanisms at the bottom of the magazine that release matrices one at a time as keys are pressed on the keyboard. There is an escapement for each channel in the magazine.

==== Maintenance and lubrication ====
To keep the matrices circulating smoothly throughout the machine, it is necessary that oil not be allowed anywhere near the matrix path. Oil in the matrix&#x27;s path (due to careless maintenance or over-lubrication of nearby parts) can combine with dust, forming a gummy substance that is eventually deposited in the magazine by the matrices. This can cause the matrix to be released from the magazine slower than its usual speed, and usually results in a letter or two arriving out of sequence in the assembler — a &quot;matrix transposition&quot;. When these machines were in heavy use, it was not uncommon for an operator to set type at the rate of over 4,000 ems per hour. The fastest operators could exceed 10,000 ems per hour (approximately 10 to 30 words per minute in today&#x27;s units), hence careful lubrication and regular cleaning were essential to keep these machines operating at full potential.

=== Keyboard and composing section ===

In the composing section, the operator enters the text for a line on the keyboard. Each keystroke releases a matrix from the magazine mounted above the keyboard. The matrix travels through channels to the assembler where the matrices are lined up side by side in the order they were released.

When a space is needed, the operator touches the &quot;spaceband lever&quot; just to the left of the keyboard. This releases a &quot;spaceband&quot; from the spaceband box. Spacebands are stored separately from the matrices because they are too big to fit in the magazine.

Once enough text has been entered for the line, the operator depresses the &quot;casting lever&quot; mounted on the front right corner of the keyboard. This lifts the completed line in the assembler up between two fingers in the &quot;delivery channel&quot;, simultaneously tripping the catch holding it in position. The spring-operated delivery channel then transports the line into the casting section of the machine, and engages the clutch that drives the casting section and the subsequent transfer into the distribution section. The operator is now finished with the line; the remaining processing is automatic. While the line is being cast, the operator can continue entering text for the next line.

==== Keyboard ====
The keyboard has 90 keys. The usual arrangement is that black keys on the left were for small letters, white keys on the right were for capital letters, and blue keys in the center for numbers, punctuation marks, spaces, small caps and other items. There is no shift key of the kind found on typewriters.

The arrangement of letters corresponds roughly to letter frequency, with the most frequently used letters on the left. The first two columns of keys are: e, t, a, o, i, n; and s, h, r, d, l, u. A Linotype operator would often deal with a typing error by running his fingers down these two columns, thus filling out the line with the nonsense words etaoin shrdlu, in what is known as a &quot;run down&quot;. It is often quicker to cast a bad slug than to hand-correct the line within the assembler. The slug with the run down is removed once it has been cast, or by the proofreader.

The linotype keyboard has the same alphabet arrangement given twice, once for lower-case letters, the keys in black, on the left side of the keyboard, and once for upper-case letters, the keys in white, located on the right side of the keyboard. The blue keys in the middle are punctuation, digits, small capital letters and fixed-width spaces. In proper keyboard operation, an experienced operator&#x27;s left hand operates only the spaceband key and the left column of keys. The operator&#x27;s right hand strokes the remaining keys on the entire keyboard.

The keys of the keyboard are connected by vertical pushrods to the escapements. When a key is pressed, the corresponding escapement is actuated, which releases a matrix from the magazine. With one exception, each key corresponds directly to a channel in the standard (&quot;90 channel&quot;) magazine. The one exception is the lower-case letter &quot;e&quot;: that letter is used so often that the &quot;90 channel&quot; magazine actually has 91 channels, with two channels (the leftmost two) both used for the letter &quot;e&quot;. Similarly, the &quot;72 channel&quot; magazine actually has 73 channels, with the leftmost two being used for lower-case &quot;e&quot;. Alternate lines release matrices alternately from the two &quot;e&quot; channels in the magazine.

On machines that support multiple magazines, there is a shifting mechanism that controls which magazine is currently connected to the keyboard. In most machines, this is done by raising or lowering the stack of magazines.

==== Spaceband box ====

In justified text, the spaces are not fixed width; they expand to make all lines equal in width. In linotype machines this is done by spacebands. A spaceband consists of two wedges, one similar in size and shape to a type matrix, one with a long tail. The wide part of the wedge is at the bottom of the tail, so pushing the tail up expands the spaceband.

Due to their size, spacebands are not held in the magazine, but in a spaceband box and released one at a time by pressing the spaceband lever at the left edge of the keyboard.

==== Assembler ====
As the matrices are released from the magazine, they are guided by way of partitions in the assembler front down to a rapidly moving belt, which brings the matrices into the assembler. The spaceband box is positioned above the assembler, the bands dropping almost directly into the assembler. At the end of the moving belt is a rapidly rotating &#x27;star wheel&#x27; that gives each incoming matrix or spaceband a small kick to make room for the next one (the star wheel is made of a phenolic-type material to minimize wear of the matrices and bands).

The assembler itself is a rail that holds the matrices and spacebands, with a jaw on the left end set to the desired line width. When the operator judges that the line is close enough to full (some machines have an attached bell to accomplish the same thing), he raises the casting lever on the bottom of the keyboard to &quot;send&quot; the line to the casting section of the linotype machine. The remaining processing for that line is automatic; as soon as the finished line has been transferred to the casting section, the operator can begin composing the next line of text.

=== Casting section ===

The casting section of the machine operated intermittently when triggered by the operator at the completion of a line. The full casting cycle time was less than nine seconds. Motive power for the casting section came from a clutch-operated drive running large cams (the keyboard and distributor sections ran all the time, since distribution may take much longer; however, the front part of the distributor completed its job before the next line of matrices was distributed). The construction of the machine was such that both the return of the former line to the magazine and the composition of the next line could occur while the current line was being cast, enabling very high productivity.

Older machines typically had a 850- or 1140-revolution-per-minute motor geared to the main clutch wheel, the inner shaft engaging this wheel while the casting cycle was in operation. An external leather belt on this wheel ran a second jackshaft, which powered the distributor and keyboard matrix conveyor and escapements through additional belting off this shaft. Gas fired pots, such as in the illustration below, were most common in the earlier years, with the pot being thermostatically controlled (high flame when under temperature and low flame when up to temperature), and then a second smaller burner for the mouth and throat heating, with the more modern installations running on 1500 watt electric pots with an initially rheostat controlled mouth and throat heaters (several hundred watts on the electric models). The temperature was precisely adjusted to keep the lead and tin type metal liquified just prior to being cast. Newer machines, and the larger machines above 36 EM Matrix size typically used the more standardized motor after v-belts came into common use in the 1930s. The large machines also had the so-called &#x27;double pot&#x27;, with either larger gas burners, or else 2250-watt pot heaters and larger mouth and throat heaters. The most modern Linotypes had the mouth and throat heaters thermostatically controlled, an improvement over the manual rheostat adjustment, or gas flame adjustment.
The Linotype company supplied kerosene heaters and line-shaft operated machines for use in locales without electricity.

The casting section receives completed lines from the assembler, and uses these to cast the type slugs that are the product of the linotype machine. The casting section is automatic: once it is activated by the operator sending a completed line by raising the casting lever, a series of cams and levers move the matrices through the casting section and control the sequence of steps that produce the slug.

The casting material is an alloy of lead (85%), antimony (11%), and tin (4%), and produces a one-piece casting slug capable of 300,000 impressions before the casting begins to develop deformities and imperfections, and the type must be cast again.

The continuous heating of the molten alloy causes the tin and antimony in the mixture to rise to the top and oxidize along with other impurities into a substance called &quot;dross&quot; which must be skimmed off. Excessive dross formation leads to the alloy softening as the proportion of lead increases. The mixture must then be assayed and tin and antimony added back (in the form of a specially proportioned alloy) to restore the original strength and properties of the alloy.

==== Justification ====
From the assembler, the assembled line moves via the &quot;first elevator&quot; to the &quot;justification vise&quot;. The vise has two jaws (1 and 2 in the illustration) which are set to the desired line width. The spacebands are now expanded to justify the line. When the line is justified, the matrices fit tightly between the vise jaws, forming a tight seal that will prevent the molten type metal from escaping when the line is cast.

Justification is done by a spring-loaded ram (5) which raises the tails of the spacebands, unless the machine was equipped with a Star Parts automatic hydraulic quadding attachment or Linotype hydraquadder.

If the operator did not assemble enough characters, the line will not justify correctly: even with the spacebands expanded all the way, the matrices are not tight. A safety mechanism in the justification vise detects this and blocks the casting operation. Without such a mechanism, the result would be a &quot;squirt&quot; of molten type metal spraying out through the gaps between the matrices, creating a time-consuming mess and a possible hazard to the operator. If a squirt did occur, it was generally up to the operator to grab the &quot;hell bucket&quot; and catch the flowing lead. It was so called because the bucket would often &quot;go to hell&quot;, or melt, while holding the molten lead that was still extremely hot. Also, in conjunction with possible hazards facing an operator, toxic lead fumes were possible, as they were the result of melting the lead ingots for casting.

==== Mold disk and crucible ====
The justification vise holds the assembled line against the face of the &quot;mold disk&quot;. The mold disk has rectangular openings which correspond to the line length and point thickness of the &quot;slugs&quot; (cast lines) to be made. &quot;Mold liners&quot; fit into these openings for specific slug dimensions. The maximum line length of the typical linecaster is 30 picas. A less common variant was fitted with 42 pica molds, though these are now rare to non-existent.

Directly behind the mold disk is the crucible, which contains molten type metal at an optimal 535 °F. At the moment before casting, the mold disk moves forward on its slide. Studs in the mold disc engage with blocks on the vise so that the mold disc seats gently, yet tightly and squarely against the line of matrices held in the first elevator jaws and between the vise jaws. The vise jaws compress the line of matrices so molten metal is prevented from squeezing between the mats on cast. The crucible tilts forward, forcing the mouthpiece tightly against the back of the mold. The plunger in the well of the crucible quickly descends, forcing the molten metal up the crucible throat and injecting it into the mold cavity through the array of orifices in the mouthpiece. The jets of molten metal first contact against the casting face of the matrices, and then fills the mold cavity to provide a solid slug body. These have character shapes punched into them, so the result is a cast &quot;slug&quot; with the character shapes of the line on its top face. The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten type metal and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.

When casting is complete, the plunger is drawn upward, pulling the metal back down the throat from the mouthpiece. The pot pulls backward away from the mold. The mold disk retracts from the vise studs which held it in perfect relation to the mold, thus breaking the slug away from the matrices. The mold disc then rotates counter-clockwise. In its travel, the slug base is trimmed by the back knife for height to paper (.918&quot;) and then returns to its neutral position in front of the &quot;ejector blades&quot; and aligned with the &quot;knife block assembly&quot; a pair of honed knives with a fixed knife, and a knife which is set to the point thickness of the mold liners being cast with. The knives are set to dead parallel. The fixed knife on the left bears against the smooth side of the slug (the mold body face of the slug) as it brushes next to it, and the right knife trims the ribs on the slug (the mold cap face of the slug). The disk stops when the mold is vertical, on the right, directly in front of the &quot;ejector&quot;.

The ejector is a stacked series of narrow blades that push the completed slug from the mold aperture in the mold disk. The blades are narrow enough to pass through a mold set to 6-points in thickness with .004&quot; clearance between the fixed mold face and the left side of the blades. The blades are each 2 picas in width and the number of blades engaged on ejection are set based on the line length being cast. All blades are engaged for a 30 pica slug, fewer are engaged as the measure of the slug body is narrowed by the use of progressively longer mold liners. This prevents the ejector blades from striking the back of a mold liner on narrow slugs. As the slug is pushed from the mold, the slug passes a set of knife edges in the knife block, which trims off any small irregularities in the casting and produces a slug of exactly the desired point thickness. From there, the slug drops into the &quot;galley tray&quot; which holds the lines in the order in which they were cast.

=== Distribution mechanism ===
The most significant innovation in the linotype machine was that it automated the distribution step; i.e., returning the matrices and space bands back to the correct place in their respective magazines. This is done by the &quot;distributor&quot;.

After casting is completed, the matrices are pushed to the &quot;second elevator&quot; which raises them to the &quot;distributor&quot; at the top of the magazine. The space bands are separated out at this point and are returned to the spaceband box.

The matrices have a pattern of teeth at the top, by which they hang from the &quot;distributor bar&quot;. Some of the teeth are cut away; which pattern of teeth is cut away depends on the character on the matrix; i.e., which channel in the magazine it belongs in. Similarly, teeth are cut away along portions of the distributor bar. The bar on the elevator has all teeth, so it will hold any matrix (but not the space bands, which have no teeth at all).

==== Distributor bar and matrix teeth coding ====
As the matrices are carried along the distributor bar by the distributor screws, they will hang on only so long as there are teeth to hold them. As soon as the matrix reaches the point where each of its teeth corresponds to a cut-away tooth on the distributor bar, it is no longer supported and will drop into the matrix channel below that point.
The pattern of teeth is a 7-bit binary code, with the innermost pair of teeth at the bottom of the notch being the most significant bit. The codes count up from the left side of the main magazine. Code 0 (no teeth) is for spacebands, which are not carried up to the distributor. Code 1 is skipped (no reason for this is given in the Linotype manual). Codes 2 through 92 are for the 91-channel main magazine, and the codes above that are for the auxiliary magazine, if one is installed on the machine. The widest auxiliary magazine has 34 channels, so its rightmost channel is code 125. Code 126 is unused while code 127 is used for pi matrices (described below).

==== Pi matrices ====
In typesetting, it is sometimes necessary to use characters that are uncommon or obscure enough that it does not make sense to assign them to a magazine channel. These characters are referred to as &quot;pi characters&quot; or &quot;sorts&quot;. (&quot;Pi&quot; in this case refers to an obscure printer&#x27;s term relating to loose or spilled type.) Footnote marks, rarely used fractions, and mathematical symbols are examples of pi characters. In the linotype machine, a pi matrix has all teeth present (code 127, no teeth cut away) so it will not drop from the distributor bar and will not be released into either the main or the auxiliary magazine. Instead, it travels all the way to the end and into the flexible metal tube called the &quot;pi chute&quot; and is then lined up in the &quot;sorts stacker&quot;, available for further use.

<text>Mastercam is a suite of computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and CAD/CAM software applications developed by CNC Software, LLC. Founded in Massachusetts in 1983, CNC Software are headquartered in Tolland, Connecticut.

Mastercam is CNC Software&#x27;s main product. It started as a 2D CAM system with CAD tools that let machinists design virtual parts on a computer screen and also guided computer numerical controlled (CNC) machine tools in the manufacture of parts. Mastercam has been ranked by CIMdata Inc. as the most widely used CAM package in the world since 1994.

==History==

===Early Versions===

Early versions of Mastercam were released for MS-DOS and the Apple IIe starting in the mid 1980s. 
Throughout the 1980s, Mastercam underwent significant development and improvements. It quickly gained popularity for its user-friendly interface and the robustness of its toolpaths, making it a preferred choice in manufacturing industries. As the software evolved, it added more features, such as 3D milling and lathe turning, to accommodate a wider range of manufacturing needs and complexities.

In its early days, Mastercam combined ease of use with powerful programming capabilities, allowing users to design parts and control CNC machines to manufacture parts precisely. The first version of Mastercam was released in 1983 and was one of the first to introduce CAD/CAM software designed for both machinists and engineers, enabling the transition from drawing board designs to digital CNC programming.

===Modernization===

In the 1990s, Mastercam significantly expanded its capabilities, introducing 3D design and machining functionalities along with high-speed machining options to cater to the increasing demand for precision in manufacturing. The software saw enhancements in its user interface and began integration with solid modeling, streamlining the design-to-manufacturing process.
 Mastercam&#x27;s global reach and adoption grew during this period, supported by a network of resellers and educational partnerships, which helped prepare the next generation of machinists and engineers. This era marked a transformative phase for Mastercam, solidifying its position as a leading CAD/CAM software through technological advancements and a focus on meeting the evolving needs of the manufacturing industry.

== Versions ==
Mastercam has been released for different machine types and at times sold as stand alone components such as CAM or CAD individually.

<doc id="198680" wikidata="Q670443" url="?curid=198680" title="Etaoin shrdlu">
<text>Etaoin shrdlu (, ) is a nonsense phrase that sometimes appeared by accident in print in the days of &quot;hot type&quot; publishing, resulting from a custom of type-casting machine operators filling out and discarding lines of type when an error was made. It appeared often enough to become part of newspaper lore – a documentary about the last issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot; composed using hot metal (July 2, 1978) was titled &quot;Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu&quot;. The phrase &quot;etaoin shrdlu&quot; is listed in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and in the &quot;Random House Webster&#x27;s Unabridged Dictionary&quot;.

The letters in the string are, approximately, the 12 most commonly used letters in the English language; differing sources do give slightly different results but one well-known sequence is ETAOINS RHLDCUM, ordered by their frequency.

==History==
The letters on type-casting machine keyboards (such as Linotype and Intertype) were arranged by descending letter frequency to speed up the mechanical operation of the machine, so lower-case codice_1 and codice_2 were the first two columns on the left side of the keyboard.

Each key would cause a brass &#x27;matrix&#x27; (an individual letter mold) from the corresponding slot in a font magazine to drop and be added to a line mold. After a line had been cast, the constituent matrices of its mold were returned to the font magazine.

If a mistake was made, the line could theoretically be corrected by hand in the assembler area. However, manipulating the matrices by hand within the partially assembled line was time-consuming and presented the chance of disturbing important adjustments. It was much quicker to fill out the bad line and discard the resulting line of text than it was to redo it properly.

To make the line long enough to proceed through the machine, operators would finish it by running a finger down the first columns of the keyboard, which created a pattern that could be easily noticed by proofreaders. Occasionally such a line would be overlooked and make its way into print.

==Appearances outside typography==
The phrase has gained enough notability to appear outside typography, including:

===Computing===
* SHRDLU was used in 1972 by Terry Winograd as the name for an early artificial-intelligence system in Lisp.
* The ETAOIN SHRDLU Chess Program was written by Garth Courtois, Jr. for the Nova 1200 mini-computer, competing in the 6th and 7th ACM North American Computer Chess Championship 1975 and 1976.
* &quot;Etienne Shrdlu&quot; was used as the name of a character in &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;, touch-typing training software from the late 1980s.

Finney&#x27;s 1935 &quot;The Circus of Dr. Lao&quot;, and &quot;The Black Hole Travel Agency&quot; novels by Jack McKinney.
*Variations of &quot;Etaoin Shrdlu&quot; are used in the title of some works, including &quot;Etaoin Shrdlu&quot;, a 1942 short story by Fredric Brown about a sentient Linotype machine (a sequel, &quot;Son of Etaoin Shrdlu&quot;, was written by others in 1981); the 1945 whimsical short story &quot;Etaoin and Shrdlu&quot; by Anthony Armstrong which ends &quot;And Sir Etaoin and Shrdlu married and lived so happily ever after that whenever you come across Etaoin&#x27;s name even today it&#x27;s generally followed by Shrdlu&#x27;s&quot;; a 50-year history of the National Press Club (USA) published in 1958 titled &quot;Shrdlu – An Affectionate Chronicle&quot;; and &quot;The Best of Shrdlu&quot;, a collection by Denys Parsons of humorous misprints and double meanings from newspapers that Parsons ascribed to a mischievous character named Gobfrey Shrdlu, referring to collectors of them as Shrdlologists. 
* Three pieces in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine were published in 1925 under the pen name Etain Shrdlu. At least one piece in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine had Etaoin Shrdlu in the title.
* Douglas R. Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&quot; includes a chapter named &quot;SHRDLU, Toy of Man&#x27;s Designing,&quot; which features a character named &quot;Eta Oin&quot; using a computer program &quot;SHRDLU&quot; — a reference to Terry Winograd&#x27;s program and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man&#x27;s Desiring&quot;.
* Etaoin Shrdlu is the name of a character in at least two Robert Crumb comic stories, including &quot;Weirdo&quot;.
* &quot;Eotain&quot; and &quot;Shurdlu&quot;, using these spellings, are the names of two characters who make sporadic joint appearances in Phil Foglio&#x27;s webcomic &quot;Girl Genius&quot;. 
* Etaoin and Shrdlu both appear frequently in the drawings of Emile Mercier as place names, racehorses&#x27; names, and people&#x27;s names.
* The French equivalent, Elaoin Sdrétu, appears in André Franquins &quot;Noël et l’Elaoin&quot; (1978).
* The rogue-like video game &quot;Nethack&quot; uses randomized names for unidentified magic scrolls; one of these names is ETAOIN SHRDLU.
* &quot;Molten Fairies: Sprites of a Newspaper&quot;, featuring Etaoin, Shrdlu, and Cmfwyp, appeared in Perth&#x27;s &quot;The Daily News&quot; in 1922.
* James Schmitz uses the sequence as a swear-word in several of his pieces.

===Music===
* Shrdlu (Norman Shrdlu) is listed as the composer of &quot;Jam Blues&quot;, cut 1 on the 1951 Norman Granz-produced jazz album released in 1990 as &quot;Charlie Parker Jam Session&quot;. This appears to be a joke on Granz&#x27;s part as Norman Shrdlu is credited in several Parker (and other) tunes that are jam sessions rather than compositions.
* &quot;Etaoin Shrdlu&quot; is the title of the first song on Cul de Sac&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall&quot;.
* &quot;Etaoin&quot; and &quot;Shrdlu&quot;, written and performed by Dallas Roberts, are original musical pieces created for the soundtrack of the U.S. television series &quot;House of Cards&quot;, Season 2, Episode 10.

<doc id="198681" wikidata="Q3091390" url="?curid=198681" title="Federalism in China">
<text>Chinese federalism refers to political theories that argue that China&#x27;s central government should share sovereignty with regional entities under a form of federalism. Such proposals were made in the early twentieth century, in connection with the end of the Qing dynasty, as well as more recently, with a view to providing checks against the power of the central government and settling the relationship between Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and other potential political entities (including provinces of mainland China).

Wu Bangguo, who used to be the official number two in China&#x27;s leadership structure, stated in 2011 that there would be no federal system in China. He said: &quot;There will be no separation of powers between the different branches of government and no federal system. It is possible that the state could sink into the abyss of internal disorder [if this happened].&quot;

==Republic-era proposals==

The Revive China Society, founded in November 1894 by Sun Yat-sen, was among the first to suggest that a future Chinese government should be established on federal lines—a feeling expressed in the organization&#x27;s oath, &quot;Expel the northern barbarians, revive &quot;Zhōnghuá&quot;, and establish a unified (&quot;hézhòng&quot;) government&quot;. The term &quot;hézhòng&quot;, literally meaning &quot;many unified as one&quot;, refers to a federal structure such as the United States.

During the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, fourteen provinces proclaimed independence from the Qing dynasty and reunited as the Republic of China. But when the Guizhou Provincial Consultative Council proclaimed independence, they asked to build the Great Han Federal Democratic Republic. Prior to January 1912, one semi-official translation of the country&#x27;s new name used by revolutionary Shanghai Military Government was the United Provinces of China. Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s title in 1912 was &quot;President of the Provisional Government of the United Provinces of China&quot;. Chinese federalists from this period often used &quot;United Provinces&quot; instead of &quot;Federation&quot; or &quot;United States&quot; because &quot;states&quot; suggested a more independent arrangement than &quot;provinces.&quot; In other words, they wished to avoid the impression that federalism implied separatism.

Proposals for a federal Chinese state were first advanced in the 1920s, but these proved unpopular. These often used the phrase United Autonomous Provinces as the name of the intended system. Hunan was the center of this movement. The young Mao Zedong even advocated the formation of a &quot;Republic of Hunan&quot; during that period. But many intellectuals, including Sun Yat-sen, argued that these proposals would limit the ability of China to fight off external invasion and would legitimize the rule of warlords. By the 1920s, Sun categorically rejected federalism. The young Mao Zedong wrote on the Ta Kung Pao proposing the idea of splitting the whole China into 27 countries. He wrote︰

==Communist-era developments==
After Chinese Communists established the Chinese Soviet Republic in Jiangxi, they aimed at a political system modeled after the union republics of the Soviet Union. According to their plans, China was to be a Soviet federal republic with several autonomous republics (such as Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet). During the period of the Long March they established a small autonomous republic for Tibetans in Sichuan. In Shaanxi, however, they changed their nationality policy, abandoning their plan to establish autonomous republics (as in the Soviet Union) in favor of autonomous regions. The first of these to be created was Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947.

When the People&#x27;s Republic of China was founded in 1949, it was divided into six semi-independent greater administrative areas. The central government was transferred from the People&#x27;s Government of North China and just controlled northern China and Inner Mongolia. Other greater administrative areas had more autonomy. This autonomy had ended completely by 1954.

More recently, some economists have argued that during the process of economic reform that the People&#x27;s Republic has evolved into a &quot;de facto&quot; federal state in which provinces have wide discretion to implement policy goals which are set by the PRC central government and in which provinces and localities actively compete with each other in order to advance economically.
According to a 2004 study conducted by Bo Zhiyue, Chair of the Department of International Studies at the St. John Fisher College, provincial authorities have greater institutional power than central institutions. Bo concluded that after the 16th Party Congress, due to personnel transfers between the provinces and the centre, the central authorities emerged more powerful, but was still shy of outpowering the provincial authorities on his power index score.

==Future proposals==
===Charter 08===
Charter 08, co-written by the formerly incarcerated human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo calls for the establishment of a Chinese &quot;Federal Republic&quot;. The relevant proposal states:

&quot;A Federated Republic. A democratic China should seek to act as a responsible major power contributing toward peace and development in the Asian Pacific region by approaching others in a spirit of equality and fairness. In Hong Kong and Macau, we should support the freedoms that already exist. With respect to Taiwan, we should declare our commitment to the principles of freedom and democracy and then, negotiating as equals and ready to compromise, seek a formula for peaceful unification. We should approach disputes in the national-minority areas of China with an open mind, seeking ways to find a workable framework within which all ethnic and religious groups can flourish. We should aim ultimately at a federation of democratic communities of China.&quot;

As of late 2010, Charter 08 has already been signed by more than 10,000 people both inside and outside China.

===Federal Republic of China===
A Federal Republic of China is a proposed future federal republic encompassing mainland China (and its provinces), Macau, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This &quot;Third Republic&quot; (following on from the Republic of China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China) is proposed by supporters of the Tibet independence movement, although it would not in effect create an independent Tibet. Yan Jiaqi, writing for the Tibetan government-in-exile, has written that:
&quot;It would be a federation with the characteristics of a confederation. Federal China would consist of two kinds of republics: &#x27;loose republics&#x27; such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang: and &#x27;close republics&#x27; consisting the rest of China.&quot;According to Yan:&quot;They would differ from the existing federal countries in their defence, taxation and legal systems.&quot;This model, however, in which the close republics would have an arrangement based on the United States of America, and the loose republics more on the European Union, is not agreed upon by all advocates of a Federal Republic.

It was also reportedly considered by a Taiwan Affairs Office official as an alternative for the one country, two systems principle.

On June 4, 2020, a proposed New Federal State of China was announced, led by an exiled billionaire, Guo Wengui (a.k.a. Miles Kwok), and Steve Bannon.

===&quot;United China&quot; or &quot;United States of China&quot;===
Another concept is that of a United China or a United States of China. First devised in the early 1920s by Chen Jiongming, it was modeled closely after the United States of America. Given the political, social and linguistic realities of China in the warlord period, Chen Jiongming believed that a federalist approach was the only feasible way to eventually establish a united, democratic republic. Beginning with Guangdong as a model state, he wanted to organize a &quot;United States of China in the manner of the American experience&quot; through negotiation with federalists from all parts of the country (New York Times June 27, 1922).

This usage was popularized after Chinese Communist Party general secretary Jiang Zemin in 2001 made a comment that a united China can adopt a new national name and flag. Large economic ties between China and Taiwan have also motivated the occasional informal use of the term to describe a united China.

The introduction of Special Economic Zones since the 1980s have led to the development of several distinct regional economies within the People&#x27;s Republic of China, such as the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and the Bohai Rim. Several of these regions have economies the size of small developed nations. Some scholars who use the term United States of China argue that during the process of economic reform the People&#x27;s Republic has evolved into a &quot;de facto&quot; federal state in which these economic regions have wide discretion to implement policy goals which are set by the PRC central government and in which provinces and localities actively compete with each other in order to advance economically.

===&quot;United Republics of China&quot;===

The concept of a United Republics of China first appeared in the &quot;Outline of (the) Post-War New World Map&quot; created by Maurice Gomberg and published in Philadelphia in early 1942. The map shows a proposal to re-arrange the world after an Allied victory against the Axis forces. In the map the United Republics of China (URC) includes most parts of present-day China, Korea, the erstwhile French colony of Indochina (now Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia), Thailand and Malaya. Otherwise, North Manchuria and Mongolia belong to the USSR; Taiwan and Hainan become territories of the United States.

In 2004, Lin Chong-Pin, former deputy Minister of Defense of the Republic of China, said that a think tank in Beijing or Shanghai gave a proposal for United Republics of China. None of this proposal has become public. But in the same years the officials and think-tanks of the People&#x27;s Republic of China have often shown an interest in the 1964 merger of mainland Tanganyika and the archipelago of Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanzania. As Zanzibar has its own president, government, parliament, autonomy, etc. and the president of Zanzibar served as the vice-president of Tanzania until the first multi-party elections in 1995, Tanzania may have provided an examplar of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s proposals for &quot;One country, two systems&quot; in China in the 1980s.

In 2011, Li Yi-hu, director of Institute of International Politics, University of Peking, said that Tanzania and Zanzibar, the model of &quot;One country, two constitutions&quot;, could be referring to &quot;One China, two constitutions&quot;. In February 2011, &quot;China Review News&quot; published an article about the Tanzanian style of Chinese unification.

<text>Internet Security Systems, Inc., often known simply as ISS or ISSX (after its former NASDAQ ticker symbol), was a provider of security software and managed security services. It provided software and services for computers, servers, networks, and remote locations that involve preemptive security against threats before they affect a business. Founded in 1994, the company was acquired by IBM in 2006.

== History ==
In 1992, while attending the Georgia Institute of Technology, Christopher Klaus developed the first version of Internet Security Scanner. In 1994, Klaus founded Internet Security Systems (ISS) to further develop and market Internet Security Scanner, which later became Internet Scanner. Although the larger shareholder, Klaus took the role of chief technology officer (CTO), while Tom Noonan was recruited as chief executive officer in 1995. In 1996 David Strohm from Greylock Ventures and Bob Davoli, from Sigma Partners, led the first round of venture capital investment in ISS. In 1997, Ted Schlein from Kleiner Perkins and ATT Ventures invested in the next round. The initial public offering of the company on NASDAQ was on March 23, 1998.

Further products in security software space followed, including Network Sensor and Server Sensor which were both developed in-house. In 1998, ISS acquired the UK company March Information Systems, and rebranded their Security Manager product as System Scanner. About the same time, ISS acquired the company DbSecure, founded by Eric Gonzales and Aaron C. Newman, to add database security to their products. The DbSecure product was rebranded as Database Scanner. Subsequently, ISS acquired Network ICE and integrated their BlackICE technology into the ISS product range. 

In 2004 Klaus stepped down as CTO, although he remained a significant shareholder and chief security advisor. His role as CTO was taken by Chris Rouland.

On August 23, 2006, IBM announced its intention to acquire Internet Security Systems for $1.36 billion and its Japanese subsidiary, ISS KK, for additional $570M. Total acquisition transaction size was $1.93 billion. On October 16, 2006, the deal was approved by ISS shareholders.

By 2011, IBM accumulated more than 10 security-related startups and these, including ISS, were integrated with the security intelligence software company Q1 Labs to form the Security Systems Division. The new unit was headed by Brendan Hannigan, who was Q1 Labs&#x27; previous CEO.

== Products ==
IBM has since discontinued ISS&#x27; signature product, the Proventia multifunction security appliance. This occurred after a long decline in tech support and licensing renewal service associated with the product.

Product families of ISS include:

*BlackICE
*Internet Scanner
*Network Sensor
*Proventia
*RealSecure
*Secure Log Manager
*Server Sensor
*Site Protector
*System Scanner
*Managed Security Services

Supported products include:

*Endpoint Secure Control

*Proventia Network Multi-Function Security
*Proventia Server Intrusion Prevention System for Linux
*Proventia Server Intrusion Prevention System for Windows
*Proventia Web Application Security
*Proventia Web Filter
*Virtual Server Protection for VMWare

== Location ==
IBM Internet Security Systems is headquartered in Sandy Springs, near Atlanta (Georgia, United States). Until late 2003 the company had significant development activities in Mountain View (California, United States), Kassel (Germany), Reading (UK) and Sydney (Australia), but all development has since been relocated to Atlanta. The company also maintains sales offices.

There were many support centers.

<doc id="198683" wikidata="Q220098" url="?curid=198683" title="Warlord">
<text>Warlords are individuals who exercise military, economic, and political control over a region, often one without a strong central or national government, typically through informal control over local armed forces. Warlords have existed throughout much of history, albeit in a variety of different capacities within the political, economic, and social structure of states or ungoverned territories. The term is often applied in the context of China around the end of the Qing dynasty, especially during the Warlord Era. The term may also be used for a supreme military leader.
== Historical origins and etymology ==
The first appearance of the word &quot;warlord&quot; dates to 1856, when used by American philosopher and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson in a highly critical essay on the aristocracy in England, &quot;Piracy and war gave place to trade, politics and letters; the &quot;&#x27;war-lords&quot; to the law-lord; the privilege was kept, whilst the means of obtaining it were changed.&quot;

During the First World War, the term appeared in China as &quot;Junfa&quot; (), taken from the Japanese &quot;gunbatsu&quot;. It was not widely used until the 1920s, when it was used to describe the chaos after 1918, when provincial military leaders took local control and launched the period that would come to be known in China as the Warlord Era. In China, &quot;Junfa&quot; is applied retroactively to describe the leaders of regional armies who threatened or used violence to expand their rule, including those who rose to lead and unify kingdoms.

==Conceptions of warlordism==

=== Warlordism as the dominant political order of pre-state societies ===

The other major consideration in categorizing warlords is through the lens of history. Warlordism was a widespread, dominant political framework that ordered many of the world&#x27;s societies until the modern state became globally ubiquitous. Often warlord governance in pre-modern state history was constructed along tribal or kinship lines and was congruent with early perception of &quot;nation&quot;. In colonial empires warlords served in both cooperative political capacities and as leaders of rebellions. In modern states the presence of warlords is often seen as an indicator of state weakness or failure. American historian David G. Herrmann noted, &quot;Warlordism is the default condition of humanity.&quot;

=== Economics of warlordism ===

Economist Stergios Skaperdas views warlordism as a default—albeit inefficient—competitive economic model that emerges in states where state capacity is low, but that innately evolves into an institution governing political order that uses violence or the threat of it to secure its access to &quot;rent&quot;-producing resources. It may actually have a stabilizing effect on a region. In both cases there is an inherent inefficiency in the model, as &quot;resources are wasted on unproductive arming and fighting.&quot; However, the functionality is often sustainable because it presents citizens with no choice but to accept rent levies in exchange for protection. Charles Tilly, an American political scientist and sociologist, theorized that organized crime can function as a means for war and state making. He argues that the monopoly of crime by the state—in this case being the warlords—is in order to receive protection from external rivals as well as internal political rivals.

Political scientist Jesse Driscoll uses the term &quot;redistribution politics&quot; to classify the bargaining process between warlords and the regime in states where cooperative warlord politics prevails, and when that bargaining leads to accords or informal arrangements concerning the extraction of rent—which can refer to natural resources, territory, labor, revenue or privilege. In his study of warlordism in Georgia and Tajikistan, Driscoll cites &quot;land reform, property ownership and transfers, privatization in non-transparent closed-bid settings, complex credit swaps cemented via marriages, money laundering, price-fixing schemes, and bribery&quot;, as principal sources of exchange in redistribution politics.

=== Understanding warlordism in the context of European feudalism ===
Noted theorist Max Weber suggested that classic feudalism in pre-modern-state Europe was an example of warlordism, as the state regime was unable to &quot;exercise a monopoly on the use of force within its territory&quot; and the monarch relied on the commitment of loyal knights and other nobility to mobilize their private armies in support of the crown for specific military campaigns. As noted French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville and political scientists such as E. J. Hobsbawm and Theda Skocpol observed in their analyses of the Ancien Régime, the French Revolution and democratization in Europe, that commitment was contingent upon a bargaining process in which the king or queen had to guarantee additional territory, revenue, status or other privileges, meaning that these early European states were weak and the relationship between the crown and feudal lords constituted the form of interdependent warlordism known as cooperative warlord politics.

Under the feudal system of Europe, nobility—whether feudal lords, knights, princes or barons—were warlords in that they served as regional leaders who exercised military, economic and political control over subnational territories and maintained private armies to maintain that status. While their political power to exercise social order, welfare and regional defense within their territory was derived from hereditary rights or edicts from the monarch, their military strength afforded them independence and strength to negotiate for privileges. Should the feudal lord or other noble withdraw his support from the king, either in rebellion or to form an alliance with a rival , that feudal lord or noble was now ascribing to the political order of ungoverned warlordism.

== Warlordism in the contemporary world ==

Within political science there is a growing body of research and analysis on warlordism that has emerged within weak states that have gained independence as a result of the collapse of empires. Warlord states are disproportionately concentrated within two regions—the former European colonies of Africa and the former Soviet republics of Eurasia.

=== Cooperative warlord politics ===
While warlords are commonly viewed as regional leaders who threaten the sovereignty of a state, there are a number of states where the central government functions in collusion with warlords to achieve its goal of exercising its sovereignty over regions that would otherwise fall outside its control. In such decentralized states, particularly those where armed groups challenge national sovereignty, warlords can serve as useful allies of a central government that is unable to establish a monopoly over the use of force within its national territory.

As political scientist Dr. Ariel Hernandez documented, one example is the Philippines, where successive presidential administrations—at least since Ferdinand Marcos secured power in 1965—have &quot;franchised violence to regional warlords&quot; to counter the inroads of communist insurgents, Islamic rebels and organized criminal gangs. This has led to the formation of at least 93 &quot;Partisan Armed Groups&quot;, armed militias loyal to regional warlords who, in exchange for their loyalty and willingness to use their private armies to quell the threats from these opposition groups, are granted a degree of autonomy within designated regions, the exclusive right to use violence and the right &quot;to profit from the &#x27;economy of violence&#x27; that they establish in their own areas&quot;.

====Afghanistan====
Warlordism in Afghanistan—another state where the central government is unable to extend political, military or bureaucratic control over large swaths of territories outside the capital—functions cooperatively within the framework of the state, at times. The warlords, with their established militias, are able to maintain a monopoly of violence within certain territories. They form coalitions with competing warlords and local tribal leaders to present the central government with a challenge, and often the state will bargain to gain access to resources or &quot;rent&quot;, loyalty from the warlord and peace in the region.

In exchange for peaceful coexistence, the warlord coalitions are granted special status and privileges, including the right to maintain &quot;de facto&quot; political rule within the agreed-upon territory, exert force to retain their monopoly over violence and extract rent and resources. &quot;By limiting access to these privileges, members of the dominant warlord coalition create credible incentives to cooperate rather than fight among themselves.&quot;

In the case of Afghanistan, state–warlord bargaining sometimes extends beyond these informal accords and elevates to the status of political clientelism, in which the warlords are appointed to formal government positions, such as regional governor; a title which provides them political legitimacy. During the state–warlord bargaining phase, warlords in Afghanistan have a high motivation to prolong war to create political instability, expose weakness of the central state, prompt regional criticism against the government and continue economic extraction.

====Post-Soviet republics====

In his study of warlordism in Georgia and Tajikistan, political scientist Jesse Driscoll emphasizes how the collapse of the Soviet Union precipitated the rise of militant, independence-seeking nationalist movements within the republics—particularly within the Central Asian and Caucasus regions—resulting in armed conflict and civil war. Many strongmen warlords had served in the Soviet military, police units or intelligence services and had experience operating within highly organized bureaucracies. These warlords formed well-structured militias that not only established political and economic control over territories, but institutionalized bureaucracies to establish and maintain their monopolies over violence and rent and &quot;incentivizing the behavior of citizens within a particular geographical space&quot;. Driscoll termed this warlordism &quot;militia coalition politics&quot;. A truce was reached without any disarmament of militias; instead, the warlord coalitions reached a non-violent &quot;order producing equilibrium&quot;, and eventually agreed upon a warlord-friendly civilian figurehead to assume head-of-state duties to demonstrate the legitimacy as a sovereign state to the rest of the world. This opened up Georgia and Tajikistan as states eligible to receive international aid, which thereafter became a major source of &quot;rent&quot; for the warlords, providing them with resources to increase their power and influence over these societies. As Driscoll observed, the &quot;warlords colluded to create a state&quot;.

=== Ungoverned warlordism, or warlords as &quot;stationary bandits&quot; ===

One political theory, pioneered by American economist Mancur Olson, posits that warlords can function as stationary bandits. In some African states, warlord politics can be a product of endowment-rich, extractable resources. Some nations, such as Liberia and Sierra Leone, have had stationary bandits who use extraction of resources such as diamonds, cobalt and timber (&quot;conflict resources&quot;) in order to increase their political power. They often enforce their right to these resources by claiming to be protecting the people. These warlords, or stationary bandits, often partner with compliant foreign firms and create symbiotic relationships to yield greater power for the warlords and a source of wealth for external firms. The result is a political system in which a dominant coalition of warlords&#x27; strips and distributes valuable assets in exchange for bureaucratic services and security from foreign firms.

Stationary bandits can amass power because of their economic connections with foreign firms. Oftentimes warlords will exert violence on a particular region in order to gain control. Once in control, these warlords can expropriate the property or resources from the people and land and redistribute the riches in exchange for monetary value. When people live in a particular region dominated by a warlord, they can choose to flee or live within the political structure the warlords have created. If the warlords provide protection against external threats of violence, the people will be likely to stay and continue living and working in that region, even though they are being extorted. The trade-off becomes protection for extraction, and this political framework is common in periphery regions of countries which do not have a strong central government.

== Contemporary examples of warlordism ==

=== Afghanistan ===
Modern-day Afghanistan is a multiethnic, multilingual country inhabited by distinct and often competing tribal societies, its national borders defined only following the Treaty of Rawalpindi of 1919 between the United Kingdom and the Emirate of Afghanistan. Afghanistan was briefly a democratic state until a 1973 coup, which resulted in the April Revolution of 1978.

Historically, power in Afghanistan has been decentralized and governance delegated locally to ethnic tribal leadership. Tribal leaders often act as local warlords, representing either a tribal confederacy, a tribal kinship group or a smaller tribal lineage grouping, and are expected to provide security, justice and social services to their respective &quot;constituencies&quot;. There are four dominant ethnic tribes in Afghanistan (Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks), as well as a number of proportionally smaller tribes. The Pashtuns are the largest and most dominant ethnic tribe in the country, whose name translates to &quot;Land of the Pashtuns&quot;.

The Durand Line, which forms the border between modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan, has proved a source of contention in Afghanistan and a source of challenge for the tribal authorities of Afghanistan. The line, which was negotiated between British diplomat and civil servant Mortimer Durand and Afghan Emir Abdur Khan, was a political boundary drawn in 1893 which clearly defined and demarcated the border between Afghanistan and the British Raj. Afghanistan unilaterally disputes the legitimacy of the border. Pashtuns are the prominent ethnic group in eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan, and the Durand Line served to split their traditional homeland between two nation states. The partitioning of their tribal lands is viewed by Pashtun leaders as a threat to their dominance within Afghanistan, emboldening rival ethnic tribes, and has provoked cross-border tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. While having significant political, economic and social impact on Afghanistan, the intervention of the Soviet Union (1979–89), Afghan Civil War (1989–96), Taliban regime (1996–2001, 2021–present) and United States invasion and occupation (2001–2021) have not noticeably disrupted the primacy of ethnic tribal authority, and thus the power and influence of warlords, in ordering Afghan society. Although the United States and its coalition allies have expended a considerable amount of time, effort and resources attempting to foment the centralization of government and consolidation of power in the state with its seat of power in Kabul, tribal warlords continue to maintain political influence and power throughout the country outside of Kabul.

While most warlords have power vested in them through traditional tribal customs, some hold formal regional government positions, but in both cases cooperation with the central government remains voluntary and reliant on incentives. Beginning in 2008, as it became increasingly evident that the central government in Kabul was incapable of extending its power and control to much of the country, the US military and diplomatic corps began exploring the option of engaging ethnic tribal warlords in negotiations, a strategy that continued through the Obama administration.

=== Russian Civil War and Chechen conflicts ===

Warlordism was widespread in Civil War-era Russia (1918–22). Many territories were not under the control of either the Red government in Petrograd (later in Moscow) or the White governments in Omsk and Rostov. These territories were controlled by warlords of various political colors. The Cossack ataman Semyonov held territories in the Transbaikalia region, and the &#x27;Bloody Baron&#x27; Ungern von Sternberg was the dictator of Mongolia for a short time. Meanwhile, generals such as Kolchak or Denikin are typically not considered warlords as they created more stable military and governing structures that claimed legitimacy from the prewar Tsarist state.

The term &quot;warlord&quot; was frequently used when Russian and Chechen conflicts were reignited in the 1990s.

=== Liberia ===
Liberia&#x27;s former president Charles Taylor was indicted as a diamond-embezzling warlord who aided and abetted Liberian rebels who committed. After seizing power from President Samuel Doe in a rebellion, Taylor won elections in 1997.

During his term of office Taylor was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of his involvement in the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002). His close friends included the late Col. Muammar Gaddafi of Libya; the conservative former ruler of Ivory Coast, Félix Houphouët-Boigny; the President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaoré; and a plethora of businessmen—local and foreign—who were bent on making money in Liberia and disregarded UN disapproval. Taylor was detained by the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone in 2006 after a period of enforced exile in Nigeria. He was found guilty in April 2012 of all 11 charges levied by the Special Court, including terror, murder and rape.[9] In May 2012 he was sentenced to 50 years in prison.

== Historical examples of warlordism ==

=== China ===

Local warlords with their own militias began to emerge in the effort to defeat the Taiping Rebellion of the 1860s as the Manchu bannerman armies faltered and the central authorities lost much of their control. The Republic of China was led by Yuan Shikai, a dictator. The modern Warlord Era began in 1916 upon his death. The national government existed and handled foreign affairs, but it had little internal control until the late 1920s. A period of provincial and local rule under military strongmen known as the Warlord Era lasted until the Kuomintang (KMT; Chinese Nationalist Party) consolidated its rule over much of the country under Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in 1928.

Among the prominent leaders called warlords were Yan Xishan in Shanxi province, Feng Yuxiang, and Wu Peifu, who had reputations as reformers; Zhang Zuolin, who ruled in Manchuria until the Huanggutun Incident in 1928; and a number of local warlords with infamous reputations, such as Zhang Zongchang. Although Chiang Kai-shek ascended with legitimacy into his role of leadership of the KMT by succeeding Sun Yat-sen and was recognized by foreign nations, Chiang was accused by some of being a warlord because of his rise by military campaign. The two-year Northern Expedition campaign (1926–28) not only defeated the Beiyang Army but also toppled the Beiyang government. Chiang also conquered and conscripted the forces of rival warlords in the Central Plains War of 1930. This war essentially ended the Warlord Era, albeit with the continuing autonomy of several provinces.

=== Mongolia ===
After the fall of the Mongol Empire, Mongolia was divided between the Eastern and Western Mongols. At the time of disintegration, many warlords tried to enthrone themselves or rule the khanate jointly; however, there had been powerful &quot;de facto&quot; leaders in all parts of the Mongol Empire before. The empire and the states that emerged from it were born and shaped in part from the heavy influence of roving bandits. These warlords, such as Genghis Khan and his immediate successors, conquered nearly all of Asia and European Russia. Roving bandits, contrary to the concept of stationary bandits offered by Mancur Olson, extract from region to region and stay mobile. Warlords in Mongolia could be characterized by this title because of the Mongol Empire&#x27;s lack of definitive borders and consistent expansion and conquest during the 13th and 14th centuries.

=== Vietnam ===
The Twelve Warlords War was a period ranging from 966–968 characterized by chaos and civil war. The reason this period received the title of &quot;Twelve Warlords War&quot;, or Anarchy of the 12 Warlords, is because of the struggle for power after the illegitimate succession to the throne by Dương Tam Kha after the death of Ngô Quyền. The ensuing two years were marked by local warlords rebelling in order to seize power within their local governments and challenging the Dương court. As a result, the country fractured into 12 regions, each led by a warlord.

=== Europe ===
Warlordism in Europe is usually connected to various mercenary companies and their chieftains, which often were &quot;de facto&quot; powerholders in the areas where they resided. Such free companies would arise in a situation when the recognized central power had collapsed, such as in the Great Interregnum in Germany (1254–78), in France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War after the Battle of Poitiers, or in the Kingdom of Scotland during the Wars of Scottish Independence.

Free company mercenary captains, such as Sir John Hawkwood, Roger de Flor of Catalan Company or Hugh Calveley, could be considered warlords. Several condottieri in Italy can also be classified as warlords. Ygo Gales Galama was a famous Frisian warlord, and so was his cousin Pier Gerlofs Donia, who was the leader of the Arumer Zwarte Hoop.

The Imperial commanders-in-chief during the reign of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I did hold the title &quot;Kriegsherr&quot;, of which the direct translation was &quot;warlord&quot;, but they were not warlords in the sense of the word today. Other warlords could be found in the British Isles during the Middle Ages and up into the Early Modern period; such examples include Brian Boru of Ireland and Guthrum of the Danelaw, who was the commander of the Great Heathen Army and nearly conquered all of England, Alfred of Anglo-Saxon England, first man to unify the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Europe, although it would not be completed until Edward the Elder&#x27;s reign, in which he conquered the last remnants of the Danelaw.

=== Other examples ===
Other countries and territories with warlords include, Iraq, Myanmar (Wa State), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Pakistan (Pashtun Tribal Areas), Syria and Tajikistan (Gorno-Badakhshan). Other areas include the eastern part of Ukraine, Lebanon, South Sudan, Mexico, Colombia, and Haiti.

<text>McAfee Corp. ( ), formerly known as McAfee Associates, Inc. from 1987 to 1997 and 2004 to 2014, Network Associates Inc. from 1997 to 2004, and Intel Security Group from 2014 to 2017, is an American company focused on online protection for consumers worldwide headquartered in San Jose, California.

The company was purchased by Intel in February 2011, and became part of the Intel Security division. In 2017, Intel had a strategic deal with TPG Capital and converted Intel Security into a joint venture between both companies called McAfee. Thoma Bravo took a minority stake in the new company, and Intel retained a 49% stake. The owners took McAfee public on the NASDAQ in 2020, and in 2022 an investor group led by Advent International Corporation took it private again.

== History ==
=== 1987–1999 ===
The company was founded in 1987 as McAfee Associates, named for its founder John McAfee, who resigned from the company in 1994. McAfee was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1992. In 1993, McAfee stepped down as head of the company, taking the position of chief technology officer before his eventual resignation. Bill Larson was appointed CEO in his place. Network Associates was formed in 1997 as a merger of McAfee Associates, Network General, PGP Corporation and Helix Software.

In 1996, McAfee acquired Calgary, Alberta, Canada-based FSA Corporation, which helped the company diversify its security offerings away from just client-based antivirus software by bringing on board its own network and desktop encryption technologies.

The FSA team also oversaw the creation of a number of other technologies that were leading edge at the time, including firewall, file encryption, and public key infrastructure product lines. While those product lines had their own individual successes including PowerBroker (written by Dean Huxley and Dan Freedman and now sold by BeyondTrust), the growth of antivirus ware always outpaced the growth of the other security product lines. It is fair to say that McAfee remains best known for its anti-virus and anti-spam products.

Among other companies bought and sold by McAfee is Trusted Information Systems, which developed the Firewall Toolkit, the free software foundation for the commercial Gauntlet Firewall, which was later sold to Secure Computing Corporation. McAfee acquired Trusted Information Systems under the banner of Network Associates in 1998.

McAfee, as a result of brief ownership of TIS Labs/NAI Labs/Network Associates Laboratories/McAfee Research, was highly influential in the world of open-source software, as that organization produced portions of the Linux, FreeBSD, and Darwin operating systems, and developed portions of the BIND name server software and SNMP version 3.

=== 2000–2009 ===
In 2000, McAfee/Network Associates was the leading authority in educating and protecting people against the Love Bug or ILOVEYOU virus, one of the most destructive computer viruses in history.

At the end of 2000, CEO Bill Larson, President Peter Watkins, and CFO Prabhat Goyal all resigned after the company sustained losses. Company president Gene Hodges served as interim CEO before George Samenuk was appointed CEO in 2001.

The company returned to its original name in July 2004. It restructured, beginning with the sale of its Magic Solutions business to Remedy, a subsidiary of BMC Software early in the year. In mid-2004, the company sold the Sniffer Technologies business to a venture capital backed firm named Network General (the same name as the original owner of Sniffer Technologies), and changed its name back to McAfee to reflect its focus on security-related technologies.

In 2006, Dale Fuller became interim CEO when Samenuk resigned and President Kevin Weiss was fired after the company was accused of questionable stock options practices. David DeWalt took over as CEO on April 2, 2007.

In 2007, McAfee launched the Security Innovation Alliance (SIA), a program focused on cultivating partnerships with other tech companies and integrating third-party technology with McAfee’s security and compliance risk management technology. On March 11, 2008, McAfee announced a license agreement with the US Department of Defense. This agreement allowed the DoD to integrate McAfee’s Virus Scan Enterprise and Anti-Spyware Enterprise into the Defense Information Systems Agency’s cyber-security solutions.

=== 2010–2020 ===
On April 21, 2010 McAfee sent out a bad anti-virus update (DAT 5958) that crippled millions of corporate and consumer Windows-based computers. 

On August 19, 2010, Intel announced that it would purchase McAfee for $48 a share in a deal valued at $7.68 billion. In September 2016, Intel announced their strategic partnership with TPG to turn McAfee into an independent cyber-security company as a joint venture. That deal closed on April 3, 2017.

CEO David DeWalt resigned in 2011, and McAfee appointed Michael DeCesare and Todd Gebhart as co-presidents. In 2011, McAfee also partnered with SAIC to develop anti-cyber espionage products for use by government and intelligence agencies, along with telecommunications companies.

On January 6, 2014, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced during the Consumer Electronics Show the name change from McAfee Security to Intel Security. The company&#x27;s red shield logo would remain, with the firm continuing to operate as a wholly owned Intel subsidiary. John McAfee, who no longer had any involvement in the company, expressed his pleasure at his name no longer being associated with the software. However, as of 2016 the products still bore the McAfee name.

On September 7, 2016, Intel sold its majority stake to TPG and entered into an agreement with TPG to turn Intel Security into a jointly-owned, independent cyber-security company with the McAfee name.

After the deal between the two companies closed, the company was spun back out of Intel on April 4, 2017.&quot; Chris Young assumed the CEO position as the company became an independent entity.

In 2018, the company unsuccessfully entered talks to sell majority control of McAfee to minority stakeholder Thoma Bravo. In 2018, McAfee also expanded its Security Innovation Alliance partnerships to include companies such as Atos, CyberX, Fidelis Cyber-security, Aujas, and Silver Peak.

In July 2019, McAfee began meeting with bankers to discuss returning to the market as an IPO. As an IPO, the company was estimated to be valued at $8 billion or higher. However, no deal or decision to join the public market was confirmed.

Near the end of 2019, McAfee partnered with Google Cloud to integrate McAfee’s Mvision Cloud and endpoint security technology with Google’s cloud infrastructure.

In October 2020, McAfee and its shareholders raised $740 million in the initial public offering and valued at about $8.6 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its prospectus. McAfee shares were traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under ticker symbol MCFE, marked its return to the public market after 9 years. In 2020, former McAfee CEO Chris Young left his position and was replaced by Peter Leav. However, the stock was delisted from NASDAQ and the company was taken private again in March 2022 by a multi-national investor group under the Advent International Corporation, consisting of the Canada Pension Plan, the Singaporean GIC Private Limited, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

=== 2021–present ===
In July 2021, McAfee completed the sale of its enterprise business. This transaction allowed McAfee to singularly focus on its consumer business and accelerate its strategy to be the leader in online protection for consumers.

In May 2022, Peter Leav stepped down and McAfee named Greg Johnson its new CEO.

In 2023 Greg Johnson stepped down as CEO and in July 2024 McAfee appointed Craig Boundy as President and Chief Executive Officer.

In October 2022, McAfee partnered with Visa to provide cybersecurity solutions to cardholders worldwide, expanding its reach in consumer protection.

In early 2024, McAfee launched an AI-driven threat detection system, enhancing real-time protection against evolving cyber threats.

In February 2024, the company expanded its identity theft protection services, integrating new tools for monitoring and fraud prevention.

On December 1, 2014, Intel Security announced the acquisition of PasswordBox, a Montreal-based provider of digital identity management solutions. Financial terms were not disclosed.

===Skyhigh Networks===
In November 2017, McAfee acquired Skyhigh Networks, a CASB security company. The acquisition closed January 3, 2018. In March 2021, Symphony Technology Group acquired McAfee Enterprise, including Skyhigh Networks. In January 2022, STG announced that McAfee Enterprise&#x27;s security service edge (SSE) business would operate as a separate company to be known as Skyhigh Security, built on McAfee Enterprise and Skyhigh Networks.

===TunnelBear===
In March 2018, McAfee acquired TunnelBear, a Canadian VPN service.

===Uplevel Security===
In July 2019, Uplevel Security, a data analytics company using graph theory and machine learning, announced it had been acquired by McAfee.

===NanoSec===
In August 2019, McAfee acquired NanoSec, a container security company.

== Controversies ==
===Channel stuffing lawsuit===

On January 4, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against McAfee for overstating its 1998–2000 net revenue by . Without admitting any wrongdoing, McAfee simultaneously settled the complaint, and agreed to pay a $50 million penalty and rework its accounting practices. The fine was for accounting fraud; known as channel stuffing that served to inflate their revenue to their investors.

===SEC investigation into share options===

In October 2006, McAfee fired its president Kevin Weiss, and its CEO George Samaneuk resigned under the cloud of a recent SEC investigation which also caused the departure of Kent Roberts, the General Counsel, earlier in the year. In late December 2006 both Weiss and Samaneuk had share option grant prices revised upwards by McAfee&#x27;s board. Weiss and Roberts were both exonerated by an arbitrator of all wrongdoing from the claims of McAfee in 2009.

===DAT 5958 update===

On April 21, 2010, beginning at approximately 14:00 UTC, millions of computers worldwide running Windows XP Service Pack 3 were affected by an erroneous virus definition file update by McAfee, resulting in the removal of a Windows system file (svchost.exe) on those machines as it was falsely detecting the file as w32/wecorl.a, causing machines to lose network access, sometimes enter a reboot loop and, in some cases, bluescreen. McAfee rectified this by removing and replacing the faulty DAT file, version 5958, with an emergency DAT file, version 5959 and has posted a fix for the affected machines in their consumer knowledge base. The University of Michigan&#x27;s medical school reported that 8,000 of its 25,000 computers crashed. Police in Lexington, Ky., resorted to hand-writing reports and turned off their patrol car terminals as a precaution. Some jails canceled visitation, and Rhode Island hospitals turned away non-trauma patients at emergency rooms and postponed some elective surgeries. Australian supermarket Coles reported that 10% (1,100) of its point-of-sales terminals were affected and was forced to shut down stores in both western and southern parts of the country. As a result of the outage, McAfee implemented additional QA protocols for any releases that directly impacted critical system files. The company also rolled out additional capabilities in Artemis that provide another level of protection against false positives by leveraging a whitelist of hands-off system files.

===DAT 6807-6808 update===

In August 2012, an issue with an update to McAfee antivirus for home and enterprise computers turned off the antivirus protection and, in many cases, prevented connection to the Internet. McAfee was criticized for being slow to address the problem, forcing network operations to spend time diagnosing the issue.

<text>Bernhard-Viktor Christoph-Carl von Bülow (12 November 1923 – 22 August 2011), known as Vicco von Bülow or Loriot (), was a German comedian, humorist, cartoonist, film director, actor and writer. As an artist, he was almost exclusively known under his pen name Loriot, which is the French term for the bird oriole depicted as a crest in the coat of arms of the Bülow family.

He was best known for his cartoons, the sketches from his 1976 television series &quot;Loriot&quot;, alongside Evelyn Hamann, and his two movies, &quot;Ödipussi&quot; (1988) and &quot;Pappa Ante Portas&quot; (1991).

On the television series &quot;Unsere Besten&quot; (&quot;Our Best&quot;), Loriot was ranked the 54th best German ever. In a special comedy episode of &quot;Unsere Besten&quot;, he was ranked as the most famous German comedian ever.

==Early and personal life==
Vicco von Bülow was born in Brandenburg an der Havel in Prussia, today Brandenburg, in modern north-eastern Germany. The von Bülow family belongs to German aristocracy. His parents, Johann-Albrecht Wilhelm von Bülow (1899–1972) and Charlotte (&quot;née&quot; von Roeder, 1899–1929), separated soon after he was born, and his mother died when he was six. Von Bülow and his brother grew up in Berlin with their grandmother.

Von Bülow was still in school when World War II started. After graduating early from secondary school, he followed the family&#x27;s tradition and became a military officer. He was deployed to the Eastern Front for three years, serving as of &quot;Panzergrenadierregiment&quot; 3 in the 3rd Panzer Division. He was decorated with the Iron Cross 2nd class and 1st class. His younger brother, Johann-Albrecht Sigismund von Bülow, was killed on 21 March 1945, less than two months before the end of World War II. Asked during an interview later in his life if he had been a good soldier he answered: &quot;Not good enough, otherwise I would have been part of the resistance on 20 July 1944. But for the dreadful German contribution to world history, I will be ashamed for the rest of my life.&quot;

Von Bülow completed his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1946. In 1951 he married Romi Schlumbom (born 1929), with whom he had two daughters.

==Artistic career==
Von Bülow&#x27;s talent for drawing was eminent already during his school years. After the war he studied graphic design and painting at the Landeskunstschule in Hamburg. From 1950 onwards, he published cartoons under the pseudonym &quot;Loriot&quot;, derived from the French word for oriole, his family&#x27;s heraldic animal.

In 1971, von Bülow created a cartoon dog named , which he voice acted himself. Wum became the mascot of &quot;Aktion Sorgenkind&quot;, a German humanitarian organization. During the Christmas season of 1972 Wum&#x27;s song &quot;Ich wünsch&#x27; mir &#x27;ne kleine Miezekatze&quot; (&quot;I wish I had a little kittycat&quot;), sung in sprechgesang style, became popular enough to remain in the top position of the German pop charts for nine weeks. Wum also appeared in the German show &quot;&quot; (The Big Prize), where he appeared during breaks until the 1990s. Before long, Wum was accompanied by the elephant Wendelin, and later by Blauer Klaus (Blue Klaus), an alien hovering in with his flying saucer. Loriot wrote, drew and dubbed all of these skits by himself. Each cartoon ended with Loriot asking the viewers to take part in the TV-lottery, which supported the &quot;Aktion Sorgenkind&quot;. When the show was dropped, the adventures of Wum and Wendelin ended as well. Today, Wum and Wendelin appear on the last page of the TV magazine &quot;Gong&quot;.

The first episode of the German television comedy series &quot;Loriot&quot; was produced in 1976.
In six episodes, Loriot presented sketches, usually being the protagonist himself, and short cartoons that he had drawn.
Examples of sketches from the series include &quot;Der Lottogewinner&quot; (&quot;The lottery winner&quot;), &quot;Jodeldiplom&quot; (&quot;yodeling diploma&quot;) and &quot;Englische Ansage&quot; (&quot;English announcement&quot;).

Loriot had a love of classical music and opera. In 1982, he conducted the humorous gala concert for the 100th anniversary of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. He is also related to the orchestra&#x27;s history by kinship (Hans von Bülow, the first chief conductor of the orchestra, was distantly related to Loriot). His narrative version of Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; was repeatedly performed by Loriot with the Scharoun Ensemble, a chamber music ensemble consisting of musicians of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

As a director, Loriot staged the operas &quot;Martha&quot; (Staatsoper Stuttgart, 1986) and &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (Ludwigsburg, 1988). In 1983 Radio Bremen produced the broadcast &quot;Loriot&#x27;s 60th birthday&quot; for the broadcast station ARD on the occasion of Loriot&#x27;s 60th birthday. In 1988 he received the Bavarian Film Award, Special Prize, and in 1993 the Bavarian Film Award, Honorary Award.

Loriot was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Wuppertal in 2001. He is honorary citizen of his hometown of Brandenburg an der Havel and his chosen home of Münsing from 1993 until his death. Furthermore, Loriot was a member of the Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste since that same year and of the Berlin Academy of Arts since 1997. He became honorary professor of theatrical arts at the Berlin University of the Arts in June 2003. He received numerous awards for his performance in TV, movies and other disciplines. He died in Ammerland at Lake Starnberg of old age.

==Characteristics of his work==
His cartoons hinged on the contrast between the presented situation, the dignity displayed by his typically big nosed characters and the picture&#x27;s caption. Inevitably one of these elements gets out of line, for example, when he combines the caption &quot;We demand equal treatment of men and women, even if the suckling baby might temporarily lose weight.&quot; with the picture of a bulbous-nosed man breast-feeding a baby in a distinguished manner. The topics of his cartoons were mainly drawn from everyday life, scenes of the family and middle-class society. The same contrast between absurd situation and dignified behaviour of his characters could be seen in his various sketches and films.

In the sketch &quot;Zimmerverwüstung/Das schiefe Bild&quot; (room destruction/the crooked painting) from the Loriot TV series of 1976, a maid offers a distinguished looking official – played by Loriot – who has just arrived on a house call a place in a finely furnished salon for a moment in order to let the house owners know. The person waiting looks at the furnishings from an armchair for a while. He then notices that a small oil painting hangs crooked. When he tries to correct this, he touches the adjacent painting which slides out of its frame. At nearly the same time, he accidentally throws something down from a table underneath the paintings. While reaching for it, he has to move a couch, the other end of which pushes a small table which tilts, and further items fall to the floor. In a slow chain reaction, every of his attempts to bring things in order causes further and greater disorder in the room, including whole wall shelves breaking down. His relentless efforts to repair the damage cause further damage and ultimately result in the nearly complete devastation of the salon. Finally, the maid returns, and the last camera position is behind her who stands in the opened door, looking on the still intact fraction of the room. The official walks towards her and points in the direction of the painting, with an undertone of significance telling her: &quot;The painting hangs crooked!&quot; (German: &quot;Das Bild hängt schief!&quot;).

What makes the above sketch typical for Loriot is not only the complete absurdity of the whole scene including the end, but that the character, while acting extremely clumsy, never loses his temper and keeps his dignity during the evolving catastrophe. The final remark is even spoken in an incidental manner, such as if the painting would indeed be the only problem in the room, baffling the viewer (while the reaction of the maid is not shown).

Loriot&#x27;s enormous popularity, his accurate language, and high-brow sense of comedy led to the adoption of a large number of phrases and inventions from the series&#x27; sketches into German common knowledge and everyday speech. Among these are certainly the &quot;yodeling diploma&quot;, a sentence like &quot;With that,&quot; (said diploma) &quot;you have something of your own!&quot;, &quot;the &quot;stone louse&quot;, but also remarks like, &quot;Please ... don&#x27;t talk right now.&quot;, &quot;There used to be more tinsel!&quot;, &quot;Look, a piano! A piano, a piano!&quot; or the laconic, hardly translatable &quot;Ach!?&quot; (&quot;Oh, is it?&quot;).

==Lawsuit of his daughter against the Wikimedia Foundation==
Pictures showing Loriot&#x27;s signature and German semi-postal stamps with topics of Loriot&#x27;s work that illustrated Loriot&#x27;s entry in the German-language Wikipedia were removed by the Wikimedia Foundation on 8 November 2011. This action was prompted by an interim order forbidding Wikimedia to use these images, that had been initiated by an heiress, daughter Susanne von Bülow, at the Landgericht Berlin on 6 October 2011 after an email from the heiress requesting their removal had not been answered. Wikimedia had to pay the cost of the legal proceedings. The final court decision was announced on 27 March 2012; it upheld the interim order regarding the stamps, but overturned it for the signature. Wikimedia was ordered to pay of the costs.

<doc id="198687" wikidata="Q1356561" url="?curid=198687" title="Pecos River">
<text>The Pecos River ( ; ) originates in north-central New Mexico and flows into Texas, emptying into the Rio Grande. Its headwaters are on the eastern slope of the Sangre de Cristo mountain range in Mora County north of Pecos, New Mexico, at an elevation of over 12,000 feet (3,700 m). The river flows for 926 miles (1,490 km) before reaching the Rio Grande near Del Rio. Its drainage basin encompasses about 44,300 square miles (115,000 km2).

The name &quot;Pecos&quot; derives from the Keresan (Native American language) term for the Pecos Pueblo, &quot;[p&#x27;æyok&#x27;ona]&quot;. The river was also historically referred to as the Río Natagés for the Mescalero people.

==History==
The river was the eastern territory of the Faraon (‘Pharaoh’) Apache Indians, a tribe of Apache, probably closely related to the Mescalero Apache, if not part of them. Their divisions were Ancavistis, Jacomis, Orejones, Carlanes, and Cuampes, but of these the Carlanes at least belonged to the Jicarillas. The river later played a large role in the exploration of Texas by the Spanish. In the latter half of the 19th century, &quot;West of the Pecos&quot; was a reference to the rugged desolation of the Wild West. New Mexico and Texas disputed water rights to the river until the U.S. government settled the dispute in 1949 with the Pecos River Compact. The Pecos River Settlement Agreement was signed between New Mexico and Texas in 2003.

==Dams==
Multiple dams have been built along the Pecos River. Santa Rosa Lake is 117 miles/188 km east of Albuquerque. Sumner Lake, formed by the 1939 Sumner Dam, is located between Santa Rosa and Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Two dams are located north of Carlsbad, New Mexico, at Avalon Dam and Brantley Dam, to help irrigate about as part of the Carlsbad reclamation project (established in 1906). Texas has also dammed the river at the Red Bluff Dam in the western part of that state to form the Red Bluff Reservoir. The portion of the reservoir that extends into New Mexico forms the lowest point in that state.

==Wild and Scenic river==
On June 6, 1990, of the Pecos River—from its headwaters to the townsite of Tererro—received National Wild and Scenic River designation. It includes designated &quot;wild&quot; and designated &quot;recreational&quot;.

==Pecos River Flume==

The Pecos River Flume is an aqueduct carrying irrigation water over the Pecos River. Construction took place from 1889 to 1890 and was part of the Pecos River Reclamation Project. It was originally constructed of wood and spanned . It carried water at a depth of . In 1902, a flood destroyed the flume and it was subsequently rebuilt using concrete. In 1902, it was identified as the largest concrete aqueduct in the world.

The flume and its surrounding area have been reclaimed by the city of Carlsbad and transformed into a tourist attraction, with park improvements along the river and spotlights to give a spectacular nightly view.

<text>The 41st Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 24, 1999, at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, recognizing musical achievements from the year 1998. Lauryn Hill led the ceremony with a record-breaking 10 nominations, becoming the first woman to achieve this milestone in a single night. During the event, she made history as the first woman to win five Grammy Awards in one night, the first artist to sweep the R&amp;B field, and the first female rapper to win Best New Artist. Her critically acclaimed album &quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; became the first hip-hop album to win Album of the Year. Hill&#x27;s then unprecedented sweep of the Grammys is widely regarded as one of the most significant moments in hip hop history.

The ceremony was widely dubbed as the &quot;Grammy Year of Women&quot;, because all of the nominees for Album of the Year were female artists including Madonna, Shania Twain, Sheryl Crow and Garbage (with Shirley Manson as the lead singer).

Madonna who opened the show with a performance of &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, won three awards, while the Dixie Chicks, Vince Gill, Alanis Morissette, Stevie Wonder and Shania Twain each took home two awards.
Ricky Martin&#x27;s performance of &quot;La Copa De La Vida&quot; (&quot;The Cup of Life&quot;) was considered a highlight of the night, symbolizing the rapid rise of Latin pop on the global stage.
