<text>David Murray &quot;Dav&quot; Pilkey Jr. (; born March 4, 1966) is an American comic book writer of children&#x27;s fiction. He is best known as the author and illustrator of the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; and its spin-off children&#x27;s graphic novel series &quot;Dog Man&quot;, the latter published under the respective writer and illustrator pen names of George Beard and Harold Hutchins, which are also the names of the two protagonists of the &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; series.

==Life and career==

Pilkey was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 4, 1966, to the Reverend David Pilkey, Sr. and Barbara, who was the church organist. He has one older sister. Pilkey was brought up in a conservative Christian household and went to Christian schools throughout his life.

Pilkey was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia as a child. In elementary school in North Ridgeville, Ohio, Pilkey was frequently reprimanded for his behavior in class and thus usually sat at a desk in the school hallway, where he created the &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; character. In 1987, Pilkey wrote his first book, &quot;World War Won&quot;, an allegorical fable inspired by the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union, in a national competition for student authors and won in his age category. The book&#x27;s publication in 1987 was included in the award.

The atypical spelling of his first name came when the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;Dave&quot; was left off his name tag while working at Pizza Hut.

Pilkey graduated from Kent State University. He married Sayuri Pilkey in 2005.

&quot;The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby&quot; was published in 2002 and was Pilkey&#x27;s first full complete graphic novel. It appeared at No. 6 on the &quot;USA Today&quot; bestseller list for all books, both adult and children&#x27;s, and was also a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book for Children&#x27;s Middle Grade. The first &quot;Super Diaper Baby&quot; graphic novel was published with Scholastic years before Scholastic created the Graphix imprint.

Pilkey took a break from writing for a few years to care for his terminally ill father (who died on November 13, 2008), but in 2009 agreed with Scholastic to publish four new books. The first two are graphic novels: &quot;The Adventures of Ook and Gluk: Kung-Fu Cavemen from the Future&quot;, released on August 10, 2010; and &quot;Super Diaper Baby 2: Invasion of the Potty Snatchers&quot;, released on June 28, 2011. &quot;Captain Underpants and the Terrifying Return of Tippy Tinkletrousers&quot; was released on August 28, 2012, &quot;Captain Underpants and the Revolting Revenge of the Radioactive Robo-Boxers&quot; was released on January 15, 2013, &quot;Captain Underpants and the Tyrannical Retaliation of the Turbo Toilet 2000&quot; was released on August 26, 2014, and &quot;Captain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks-A-Lot&quot; was released on August 25, 2015. Additionally, thirteen &quot;Dog Man&quot; novels have been published since August 30, 2016.

Pilkey and his wife live on Bainbridge Island, Washington.

On March 25, 2021, Dav Pilkey announced on his YouTube channel that he and Scholastic would cease further publication of the book &quot;The Adventures of Ook and Gluk&quot;, and would remove it from retailers and libraries due to some characters in the book being stereotypes. Pilkey stated that he intended to showcase diversity, equality, and non-violent conflict resolution. He also stated that even unintentional and passive stereotypes are harmful to everyone. Pilkey will donate his entire advance, past, and future royalties from the book to organizations promoting diversity that are designed to stop violence against Asians.

<text>The Adventures of Captain Underpants is an American children&#x27;s novel by Dav Pilkey, and the inaugural novel of the &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; series. It was published in September 1997, becoming a hit with children around the world. In the novel, George Beard and Harold Hutchins turn their principal, Mr. Krupp, into the &quot;greatest superhero of all time&quot;, The Amazing Captain Underpants. It has spawned many sequels and subseries such as &quot;Super Diaper Baby&quot;, &quot;Dog Man&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Ook and Gluk: Kung-Fu Cavemen from the Future&quot;.

==Plot==
George Beard and Harold Hutchins are two mischievous fourth-graders who attend Jerome Horwitz Elementary School in Piqua, Ohio. They are known for making comic books featuring Captain Underpants, a superhero of their own creation. After the boys ruin the school&#x27;s football game with an array of practical jokes, their principal, Mr. Krupp, threatens to expose their mischief to the football team using video evidence unless they submit to a list of rules he gives them. George and Harold find themselves burdened with good behavior, extra homework, and chores for Krupp. 

To escape their punishment, George orders a &quot;3-D Hypno-Ring&quot; from the Li&#x27;l Wiseguy Novelty Company. The boys use the ring to hypnotize Krupp, and Harold replaces Krupp&#x27;s videotape with one of his little sister&#x27;s &quot;Boomer the Purple Dragon&quot; sing-along videos. When George jokingly instructs Krupp to behave Captain Underpants, Krupp dresses as the Captain and leaves the school to fight crime. The boys find &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; confronting a pair of bank robbers and carry him away. 

The three witness two robots stealing a large crystal from a shop and follow them to an abandoned warehouse. There, Captain Underpants is tied up by the nefarious Dr. Diaper, who harbors a plan to annihilate the Moon with his crystal-powered Laser-Matic 2000. George uses a slingshot to hurl fake dog feces between Dr. Diaper&#x27;s legs. Believing the feces to be his own, Dr. Diaper goes to change himself, gifting George and Harold the opportunity to destroy the robots and free Captain Underpants. Harold pulls the machine&#x27;s self-destruct lever just as Dr. Diaper returns. After Captain Underpants subdues Dr. Diaper, he and the boys escape before the entire warehouse explodes, leaving Dr. Diaper for the police to apprehend. 

Back at school, Captain Underpants redresses as Krupp so the boys can reverse the hypnosis, but they have misplaced the ring&#x27;s manual. George impulsively pours a vase of water on Captain Underpants&#x27;s head, reverting him to Krupp. After Krupp leaves with Harold&#x27;s videotape, George finds the manual and throws it away, failing to notice a warning that immersing a hypnotized person in water will cause them to relapse into their trance at the sound of fingers snapping. George and Harold return to their usual mischief, but realize they must keep Mr. Krupp from hearing finger snaps, which turns him back into Captain Underpants.

==Title change==
Early printings of the book have &quot;An Epic Novel by Dav Pilkey&quot; instead of &quot;The First Epic Novel by Dav Pilkey&quot;, and the &quot;Little Apple&quot; logo on the cover.

==Development==
On why he focused on underwear in the book, Pilkey stated &quot;I think underwear is funny because you’re not supposed to laugh at it.&quot;

<text>An orgy is a sex party where guests freely engage in open and unrestrained sexual activity or group sex.

Swingers&#x27; parties do not always conform to this designation, because at many swinger parties the sexual partners may all know each other or at least have some commonality among economic class, educational attainment or other shared attributes. Some swingers contend that an orgy, as opposed to a sex party, requires some anonymity of sexual partners in complete sexual abandon. Other kinds of &quot;sex parties&quot; may fare less well with this labelling.

Participation in an &quot;orgy&quot; is a common sexual fantasy, and group sex targeting such consumers is a subgenre in pornographic films. 

The term is also used metaphorically in expressions, such as an &quot;orgy of colour&quot; or an &quot;orgy of destruction&quot; to indicate excess, overabundance. The term &quot;&quot; does not generally connote group sex and is closer to the classical roots and this metaphorical usage.

==Ancient &quot;orgia&quot;==
In ancient Greek religion, &quot;orgia&quot; (ὄργια, sing. ὄργιον, &quot;orgion&quot;) were ecstatic rites characteristic of the Greek and Hellenistic mystery religions. Unlike public religion, or the private religious practices of a household, the mysteries were open only to initiates, and were thus &quot;secret&quot;. Some rites were held at night. &quot;Orgia&quot; were part of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the Dionysian Mysteries, and the cult of Cybele, which involved the castration of her priests in a frenzied trance. Because of their secret, nocturnal, and unscripted nature, the &quot;orgia&quot; were subject to prurient speculation and regarded with suspicion, particularly by the Romans, who attempted to suppress the Bacchanals in 186 BC. &quot;Orgia&quot; are popularly thought to have involved sex, but, while sexuality and fertility were cultic concerns, the primary goal of the &quot;orgia&quot; was to achieve an ecstatic union with the divine. The Adamites were also accused of participating in orgies.

<doc id="189297" wikidata="Q1891637" url="?curid=189297" title="MSN TV">
<text>MSN TV (formerly WebTV) was a web access product consisting of a thin client device that used a television for display (instead of using a computer monitor), and the online service that supported it. The original WebTV device design and service were developed by WebTV Networks, Inc., a company started in 1995. The WebTV product was announced in July 1996 and later released on September 18, 1996. In April 1997, the company was purchased by Microsoft Corporation and in July 2001, was rebranded to MSN TV and absorbed into MSN.

While most thin clients developed in the mid-1990s were positioned as diskless workstations for corporate intranets, WebTV was positioned as a consumer product, primarily targeting those looking for a low-cost alternative to a computer for Internet access. The WebTV and MSN TV devices allowed a television set to be connected to the Internet, mainly for web browsing and e-mail. The WebTV/MSN TV service, however, also offered its own exclusive services such as a &quot;walled garden&quot; newsgroup service, news and weather reports, storage for user bookmarks (Favorites), IRC (and for a time, MSN Chat) chatrooms, a Page Builder service that let WebTV users create and host webpages that could later be shared to others via a link if desired, the ability to play background music from a predefined list of songs while surfing the web, dedicated sections for aggregated content covering various topics (entertainment, romance, stocks, etc.), and a few years after Microsoft bought out WebTV, integration with MSN Messenger and Hotmail. The setup included a thin client in the form of a set-top box, a remote, a network connection using dial-up, or with the introduction of Rogers Interactive TV and the MSN TV 2, the option to use broadband, and a wireless keyboard, which was sold optionally up until the 2000s.

The MSN TV service lasted for 18 years, shutting down on September 30, 2013, and allowing subscribers to migrate their data well before that date arrived.

The original WebTV network relied on a Solaris backend network and telephone lines to deliver service to customers via dial-up, with &quot;frontend servers&quot; that talk directly to boxes using a custom protocol, the WebTV Protocol (WTVP), to authenticate users and deliver content to boxes. For the MSN TV 2, however, a completely new service based on IIS servers and regular HTTP/HTTPS services was used.

== History ==

=== Concept ===
Co-founder Steve Perlman is credited with the idea for the device. He first combined computer and television as a high-school student when he decided his home PC needed a graphics display. He went on to build software for companies such as Apple and Atari. While working at General Magic, the idea of bringing TVs and computers together resurfaced.

One night, Perlman was browsing the web and came across a Campbell&#x27;s soup website with recipes. He thought that the people who might be interested in what the site had to offer were not using the web. It occurred to him that if the television audience was enabled by a device to augment television viewing with receiving information or commercial offers through the television, then perhaps the web address could act as a signal and the television cable could be the conduit.

=== Early history ===
A Silicon Valley startup, WebTV Networks was founded in July 1995. Perlman brought along co-founders Bruce Leak and Phil Goldman shortly after conceiving the basic concept. The company operated out of half of a former BMW car dealership building on Alma Street in Palo Alto, California, which was being used for storage by the Museum of American Heritage. WebTV had been able to obtain the space for very low rent, but it was suboptimal for technology development.

Before incorporation, the company referred to itself as Artemis Research to disguise the nature of its business. The info page of its original website explained that it was studying &quot;sleep deprivation, poor diet and no social life for extended periods on humans and dwarf rabbits&quot;. The dwarf rabbit reference was an inside joke among WebTV&#x27;s engineers – Phil Goldman&#x27;s pet house rabbit &quot;Bowser&quot; (inspiration for the General Magic logo) was often found roaming the WebTV building late into the night while the engineers were working—although WebTV actually received inquiries from real research groups conducting similar studies and seeking to exchange data.

The company hired many engineers and a few business development employees early on, having about 30 total employees by October 1995. Two early employees of Artemis were from Apple Inc: Andy Rubin, creator of the Android cell phone OS, and Joe Britt. Both men would later be founders of Danger, Inc. (originally Danger Research).

WebTV Networks&#x27; business model was to license a reference design to consumer electronics companies for a &quot;WebTV Internet Terminal&quot;, a set-top box that attached to a telephone line and automatically connected to the Internet through a dial-up modem. The consumer electronics companies&#x27; income was derived from selling the WebTV set-top box. WebTV&#x27;s income was derived from operating the WebTV Service, the Internet-based service to which the set-top boxes connected and for which it collected a fee from WebTV subscribers. The service provided features such as HTML-based email, and proxied websites, which were reformatted by the service before they were sent to set-top box, to make them display more efficiently on a television screen.

WebTV closed its first round of financing, US$1,500,000, from Marvin Davis in September 1995, which it used to develop its prototype set-top box, using proprietary hardware and firmware. The company also used the financing to develop the online service that the set-top boxes connected to. WebTV leveraged their limited startup funds by licensing a reference design for the appliance to Sony and Philips. Eventually other companies would also become licensees and WebTV would profit on the monthly service fees.

=== Announcement ===
By the spring of 1996 WebTV Networks employed approximately 70 people, many of them finishing their senior year at nearby Stanford University, or former employees of either Apple Computer or General Magic. WebTV had started negotiating with Sony to manufacture and distribute the WebTV set-top box, but negotiations had taken much longer than WebTV had expected, and WebTV had used up its initial funding. Steve Perlman liquidated his assets, ran up his credit cards and mortgaged his house to provide bridge financing while seeking additional venture capital. Because Sony had insisted upon exclusive distribution rights for the first year, WebTV had no other distribution partner in place, and just before WebTV was to close venture capital financing from Brentwood Associates, Sony sent WebTV a certified letter stating it had decided not to proceed with WebTV. It was a critical juncture for WebTV, because the Brentwood financing had been predicated on the expectation of a future relationship with Sony, and if Brentwood had decided to not proceed with the financing after being told that Sony had backed out, WebTV would have gone bankrupt and Perlman would have lost everything. Brentwood decided to proceed with the financing despite losing Sony&#x27;s involvement, and further financing from Paul Allen&#x27;s Vulcan Ventures soon followed.

WebTV then proceeded to close a non-exclusive WebTV set-top box distribution deal with Philips, which provided competitive pressure causing Sony to change its mind, to resume its relationship with WebTV and also to distribute WebTV.

The company Igor Software Laboratories, founded by Steve Hales and Jim Nitchals, licensed its SoundMusicSys engine to WebTV, allowing it to play music in formats such as MIDI. Igor contracted three additional musicians to create original music and sound effects for the device: Brian Salter, Michael Pukish and Peter Drescher. In addition to Igor, Thomas Dolby&#x27;s audio technology company Beatnik (then known as Headspace) also composed music for the device. This led to Beatnik acquiring Igor and its SoundMusicSys engine, which later became the Beatnik Audio Engine. Dolby considered the usage of sequenced audio to be saving physical space within the devices, while satisfying the needs of television viewers wanting audio to accompany the internet.

WebTV was announced on July 10, 1996, generating a large wave of press attention as not only the first television-based use of the World Wide Web, but also as the first consumer-electronics device to access the World Wide Web without a personal computer. After the product&#x27;s announcement, the company closed additional venture financing, including investments from Microsoft Corporation, Citicorp, Seagate Technology, Inc., Times Mirror Company, and other companies.

=== The launch ===

WebTV was launched on September 18, 1996, within one year after its first round of financing, with WebTV set-top boxes in stores from Sony and Philips, and WebTV&#x27;s online service running from servers in its tiny office, still based in the former BMW dealership.

The initial price for the WebTV set-top box was US$349 for the Sony version and US$329 for the Philips version, with a wireless keyboard available for about an extra US$50. The monthly service fee initially was US$19.95 per month for unlimited Web surfing and e-mail.

There was little difference between the first Sony and the Philips WebTV set-top boxes, except for the housing and packaging. The WebTV set-top box had very limited processing and memory resources, housing a 112 MHz R4640 MIPS CPU, 2 megabytes of RAM, 2 megabytes of ROM, and 1 megabyte of Flash memory. The device relied upon a connection through a 33.6 kbit/s dialup modem to connect to the WebTV Service, where powerful servers provide back-end support to the WebTV set-top boxes to provide a full Web-browsing and email experience to the subscribers.

Initial sales were slow. By April 1997, WebTV had only 56,000 subscribers, but the pace of subscriber growth accelerated after that, achieving 150,000 subscribers by Autumn 1997, about 325,000 subscribers by April 1998 and about 800,000 subscribers by May 1999. WebTV achieved profitability by Spring 1998, and grossed over US$1.3 billion in revenue through its first 8 years of operation. In 2005 WebTV was still grossing US$150 million per year in revenue with 65% gross margin.

=== WebTV briefly classified as a weapon ===
Because WebTV utilized strong encryption, specifically the 128-bit encryption (not SSL) used to communicate with its proprietary service, upon launch in 1996, WebTV was classified as &quot;munitions&quot; (a military weapon) by the United States government and was therefore barred from export under United States security laws at the time. Because WebTV was widely distributed in consumer electronic stores under the Sony and Philips brands for only US$325, its munitions classification was used to argue that the US should no longer consider devices incorporating strong encryption to be munitions, and should permit their export. Two years later, in October 1998, WebTV obtained a special exemption permitting its export, despite the strong encryption, and shortly thereafter, laws concerning export of cryptography in the United States were changed to generally permit the export of strong encryption.

=== Microsoft takes notice ===
In February 1997, in an investor meeting with Microsoft, Steve Perlman was approached by Microsoft&#x27;s Senior Vice President for Consumer Platforms Division, Craig Mundie. Despite the fact that the initial WebTV sales had been modest, Mundie expressed that Microsoft was impressed with WebTV and saw significant potential both in WebTV&#x27;s product offering and in applying the technology to other Microsoft consumer and video product offerings. Microsoft offered to acquire WebTV, build a Microsoft campus in Silicon Valley around WebTV, and establish WebTV as a Microsoft division to develop television-based products and services, with Perlman as the division&#x27;s president.

Discussions proceeded rapidly, involving Bill Gates, then CEO of Microsoft, personally. Gates called Perlman at his home on Easter Sunday in March 1997, and Perlman described to Gates WebTV&#x27;s next generation products in development, which would be the first consumer devices to incorporate hard disks, including the WebTV Plus, and the WebTV Digital Video Recorders. Gates&#x27; interest was piqued, and negotiations between Microsoft and WebTV rapidly proceeded to closure, with both sides working around the clock to get the deal done. Negotiation time was so short that the hour lost due to the change to Daylight Saving Time the night before the planned announcement, which the parties had neglected to factor into their schedule, almost left them without enough time to finish the deal.

On April 6, 1997, 20 months after WebTV&#x27;s founding, and only six weeks after negotiations with Microsoft began, during a scheduled speech at the National Association of Broadcasters conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Craig Mundie announced that Microsoft had acquired WebTV. The acquisition price was US$503 million, but WebTV was so young a company that most of the employees&#x27; stock options had yet to be vested. As such, the vested shares at the time of the announcement amounted to US$425 million, and that was the acquisition price announced. Each of the three founders received $64 million from the sale.

Subsequent to the acquisition, WebTV became a Silicon Valley–based division of Microsoft, with Steve Perlman as its president. The WebTV division began developing most of Microsoft&#x27;s television-based products, including the first satellite Digital Video Recorders (the DishPlayer for EchoStar&#x27;s Dish Network and UltimateTV for DirecTV), Microsoft&#x27;s cable TV products, the Xbox 360 hardware, and Microsoft&#x27;s Mediaroom IPTV platform.

In May 1999, America Online announced that it was going to compete directly with Microsoft in delivering Internet over television sets by introducing AOL TV.

In June 1999, Steve Perlman left Microsoft and started Rearden, a business incubator for new companies in media and entertainment technology.

=== MSN TV rebranding ===
In July 2001, six years after WebTV&#x27;s founding, Microsoft rebranded WebTV as MSN TV. Contracts were terminated with all other licensed manufacturers of the WebTV hardware except RCA, leaving them as the sole manufacturer of further hardware. Promotion of the WebTV brand ended.

In later years, the number of consumers using dialup access had dropped and as the Classic and Plus clients were restricted to dialup access, their subscriber count began to drop. Because the WebTV client was subsidized hardware, the company had always required individual subscriptions for each box, but with the subsidies ended, MSN started offering free use of MSN TV boxes to their computer users who subscribed to MSN as an incentive not to depart for discount dialup ISPs.

==== Broadband MSN TV ====
In 2001, Rogers Cable partnered with Microsoft to introduce &quot;Rogers Interactive TV&quot; in Canada. The service enabled Rogers&#x27; subscribers to access the Web via their TV sets, create their own websites, shop online, chat, and access e-mail. This initiative was the first broadband implementation of MSN TV.

In late 2004, Microsoft introduced MSN TV 2. Codenamed the &quot;Deuce&quot;, it was capable of broadband access, and it introduced a revamped user interface and new capabilities. These include offline viewing of media (so long as a user had already logged in prior), audio and video streaming (broadband only), Adobe Reader, support for viewing Microsoft Office documents (namely Microsoft Word), Windows Media Player, the ability to access Windows computers on a home network to function as a media player, and even the ability the use of a mouse. MSN TV 2 also later introduced features originally seen in the first generation of MSN TV, such as its Beatnik MIDI engine and the ability to play background music while surfing the web. MSN TV 2 used a different online service from the original WebTV/MSN TV, but it offered many of the same services, such as chatrooms, instant messaging, weather, news, aggregated &quot;info centers&quot;, and newsgroups, and like that service, still required a subscription to use. For those with broadband, the fee was US$99 yearly.

For inexpensive devices, the cost of licensing the operating system is substantial. For Microsoft, however, it would be actualizing a sunk cost, and when Microsoft released the MSN TV 2 model, they adopted standard PC architecture and used a customized version of Windows CE as the operating system. This allowed MSN TV 2 to more easily and inexpensively keep current.

=== Discontinuation ===
By late 2009, MSN TV hardware was no longer being sold by Microsoft, although service continued for existing users for the next four years. Attempting to go to the &quot;Buy MSN TV&quot; section on the MSN TV website at the time resulted in the following message being shown:

&quot;Sorry, MSN TV hardware is no longer available for purchase from Microsoft. Microsoft continues to support the subscription service for existing WebTV and MSN TV customers.&quot;

On July 1, 2013, an email was sent out to subscribers stating that the MSN TV service would be shutting down on September 30, 2013. During that time, subscribers were advised to convert any accounts on the first-generation service to Microsoft accounts and to migrate any favorites and other data they had on their MSN TV accounts to SkyDrive. Once September 30, 2013 finally arrived, the WebTV/MSN TV service fully closed. Existing customers were offered MSN Dial-Up Internet Access accounts with a promotion. Customer service was available for non-technical and billing questions until January 15, 2014.

== Technology ==

=== Set-top box ===
Since the WebTV set-top box was a dedicated web-browsing appliance that did not need to be based on a standard operating system, the cost of licensing one could be avoided. All WebTV and original MSN TV boxes featured a 32-bit MIPS RISC CPU, boot ROM, storage, RAM, and a smart card reader, which was not significantly utilized. The web browser that ran on the set-top boxes was developed in-house, but compatible with both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer standards. The WebTV set-top boxes leveraged the service&#x27;s server-side caching proxy which reformatted and compressed web pages before sending them to the box, a feature generally unavailable to dial-up ISP users at the time and as such, had to be developed by WebTV Networks. Given the fact that WebTV&#x27;s thin client software was stored in non-volatile memory, upgrades could be downloaded from the WebTV service onto set-top boxes over a phone line, as well as over the air via satellite broadcast on satellite units. The set-top boxes were also designed so that at a specified time, it would check to see if there was any email waiting for the user. If there was, it would illuminate a red LED on the front of the box so the consumer would know it was worth connecting to read their email.

The first WebTV Classic set-top boxes from Sony and Philips in 1996 had a 33.6k modem, 2 MB of RAM, 2 MB of boot ROM, and 2 MB of flash ROM. They also contained an ASIC named FIDO, designed by WebTV Networks and manufactured by NEC, which handled graphics processing that was capable of video output to NTSC and, reportedly, PAL, as well as handling system logic for IR and controlling the LEDs on the front of the box. Future models would start using 56k modems and introduce increased RAM and storage capacity.

A second model, the WebTV Plus, was introduced a year after the release of the original boxes. This model featured a TV tuner and composite inputs to allow watching television from the set-top box. The television feed could be viewed in full screen, in a PIP (Picture-In-Picture) window, or used to capture video stills as a JPEG that could then be uploaded to a WebTV/MSN TV discussion post, email, or a &quot;scrapbook&quot; on a user&#x27;s account for later use. WebTV Plus also allowed one to schedule a VCR in a manner like TiVo allowed several years later. The Plus upgraded to a 167 MHz R4640 processor, included a 56k modem, support for ATVEF, a technology that allowed users to download special script-laden pages to interact with television shows, and in original models, had a Seagate 1.1 GB hard drive for storage in place of the flash memory chips used in the previous Classic models, mainly in order to accommodate large nightly downloads of television schedules. WebTV Plus also introduced a new ASIC into the hardware to allow the new TV-based features to be possible and enhance the set top box&#x27;s graphical capabilities. Named &quot;Solo&quot;, it was announced to have support for 3-D transformations, compositing, on-the-fly image decompression, anti-aliasing, and translucency. The enhanced graphics capabilities of the Solo also allowed WebTV Networks to experiment with the idea of making WebTV Plus a platform for video gaming alongside web browsing, which currently only has confirmation in the form of first hand accounts from people who worked for or collaborated with WebTV Networks to develop games for it, and a leak that occurred in August 1998 where the WebTV hacking scene discovered a games section on an internal WebTV server that offered options to download WebTV Plus ports of Doom and You Don&#x27;t Know Jack. Two revisions of the Solo ASIC are known to have been used in the WebTV Plus throughout its lifespan: SOLO1 and SOLO3, the latter mainly being used in the New Plus revision of the model.

Around Fall 1998, plans for a &quot;Derby&quot; revision of the WebTV Plus were announced, which was rumored to have a faster CPU and more memory. Circa late 1998 or early 1999, only one Derby unit was produced by Sony as a silent revision of their INT-W200 Plus model, but no substantial changes were made to the hardware outside of the CPU being upgraded with no change in clock speed, and the modem being changed to a softmodem. As chip prices dropped, later versions of the Plus used an M-Systems DiskOnChip flash ROM instead, alongside increasing RAM capacity to 16 MB.

In Japan, WebTV had a small run starting around December 1997, with a couple &quot;Classic&quot; Japanese units being released at launch, which came with hard drives, the same amount of RAM as an Old Plus, and two times more boot ROM than American Classic and Old Plus units. In the Spring of 1999, Japanese WebTV subscribers also had the option of utilizing Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast video game console, which came with a built-in modem, to access the WebTV service. This was possible as Sega and Microsoft collaborated to create a port of the WebTV technology on the Dreamcast, using the Windows CE abstraction layer supported on the console and what&#x27;s believed to be a version of the Internet Explorer 2.0 browser engine. The Japanese service ended some time in March 2002.

As an ease-of-use design consideration, WebTV early on decided to reformat pages rather than have users doing sideways scrolling. As entry-level PCs evolved from VGA resolution of 640x480 to SVGA resolution of 800x600, and web site dimensions followed suit, reformatting the PC-sized web pages to fit the 560-pixel width of a United States NTSC television screen became less satisfactory. The WebTV browser also translated HTML frames as tables in order to avoid the need for a mouse. When the MSN TV 2 released, Microsoft had decided to forgo reformatting pages and added sideways scrolling as well as the ability to resize text on web pages with buttons on the MSN TV keyboard.

==== Satellite boxes ====

Starting in the late 90s, WebTV Networks produced reference designs of models incorporating a disk-based personal video recorder and a satellite tuner for EchoStar&#x27;s Dish Network and for DirecTV. These would be named the &quot;DishPlayer&quot; and &quot;UltimateTV&quot; respectively.

DishPlayer launched in late 1999 and was touted as &quot;the world&#x27;s first interactive satellite TV receiver&quot;. The DishPlayer is the first satellite-based DVR from Dish Network, and used a hard disk to allow users to record shows for later viewing. It could simultaneously play back video while recording as well. DishPlayer users could also control playback of programs recorded onto the set top box. DishPlayer made use of software and hardware developed by WebTV Networks to provide the user interface and features. Because of this, it was also capable of connecting to the WebTV Plus service, allowing it to browse the internet, send e-mail, and access other WebTV services. DishPlayer was also the only WebTV-based box to officially have games released for it, which were downloaded and updated over satellite. Three games were offered on the DishPlayer: Doom, You Don&#x27;t Know Jack (a port of the Netshow version), and Solitaire. Two models of the DishPlayer were released: the 7100 and 7200, which had 8.6 GB and 17.6 GB of hard disk space respectively. EchoStar stopped selling DishPlayer boxes in 2001, but the boxes still worked with Dish Network service well into the mid-2000s.

UltimateTV was a satellite-based DVR made for DirecTV that made use a dual satellite tuner to allow a user to watch or record two shows at once. It would take advantage of new hardware to achieve this, using an upgraded version of the Solo ASIC named SOLO2. This version of the ASIC has the ability to process several video streams at the same time and included a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to allow digital content to be displayed on analog television sets. While the user interface and internet service for UltimateTV are similar to WebTV/MSN TV&#x27;s, the UltimateTV software now uses Windows CE as its underlying OS as opposed to a custom one like the standard WebTV and MSN TV firmware used. This Windows CE–based OS would be used as the framework for the original Microsoft TV platform. In 2001, EchoStar sued Microsoft for failing to support the WebTV DishPlayer. EchoStar subsequently sought to acquire DirecTV and was the presumptive acquirer, but EchoStar was ultimately blocked by the Federal Communications Commission. While EchoStar&#x27;s lawsuit against Microsoft was in process, DirecTV (presumptively acquired and controlled by EchoStar) dropped UltimateTV (thus ending Microsoft&#x27;s satellite product initiatives) and picked TiVo&#x27;s DirecTV product as its only Digital Video Recorder offering.

=== Security ===

Hackers eventually figured out ways to exploit the service&#x27;s security with vulnerable URLs, resulting in access to internal sections of the production WebTV service such as &quot;Tricks,&quot; which hosted several pages designed to troubleshoot the WebTV box and service; the ability to remotely change the settings of a subscriber&#x27;s box; or even remotely performing actions on any account, including deleting them, which the service did not verify on whether the requests were coming from the account holder or not. Hackers also found a way to connect to internal WebTV services and discovered WebTV content that was previously unknown to the public, including a version of Doom for WebTV Plus units that could be downloaded from one of these services at one point.

WebTV/MSN TV was also victim to a virus written in July 2002 by 43 year old David Jeansonne, which changed the local dial-up access number on victims&#x27; boxes to 911. This number would be dialled the next time the WebTV/MSN TV box had to dial in. It was sent to 18 MSN TV users through an attachment in an email, and disguised itself by showing an interface for a &quot;tool&quot; that could change the colors and fonts of the MSN TV user interface. It was supposedly forwarded to 3 other users by some of the initial victims, making the total victim count 21. At least 10 of the victims reported having the police show up at their homes as a result of their boxes dialing 911. There are also claims of the virus having the ability to mass-mail itself, although this was not properly confirmed at the time the virus was prevalent. Jeansonne was eventually arrested in February 2004, and pled guilty on the charges of intentionally causing damage to computers and causing a threat to public safety. He was subsequently sentenced to serve six months in prison, followed by six months of home detention, as well as paying restitution to Microsoft.
=== Protocols ===
With the first generation of the WebTV/MSN TV service, the main protocol used for the majority of service communication was WTVP, or the WebTV Protocol. WTVP is a TCP-based protocol that is essentially a proprietary version of HTTP 1.0 with the ability to serve both standard web content and specialized service content to WebTV/MSN TV users. It also introduced its own protocol extensions, which include but aren&#x27;t limited to 128-bit RC4-based message encryption, ticket-based authorization, proprietary challenge–response authentication to both verify clients logging in to the service and to supply them session keys used for message encryption, and persistent connections. This protocol was supported by all WebTV and original MSN TV clients and the Sega Dreamcast release of WebTV up until the September 2013 discontinuation of the entire service (March 2002 for those in Japan).

Another protocol used by the original service is dubbed &quot;Mail Notify&quot;, a UDP-based protocol that would track online clients and send periodic datagrams directly to clients to notify them of new e-mail. Its existence has only been confirmed in a leaked Microsoft document.

=== Hacking attempts ===
In February 2006, Chris Wade analyzed the proprietary BIOS of the MSN TV 2 set top box, and created a sophisticated memory patch which allowed it to be flashed and used to boot Linux on it. An open-source solution to enabling TV output on the MSN TV 2 and similar devices was made available in 2009. There were also recorded attempts to make use of unused IDE pins on the MSN TV 2&#x27;s motherboard and supply a hard drive, most likely to add extra storage beyond the 64 MB given by the default CompactFlash storage.

<doc id="189302" wikidata="Q1374629" url="?curid=189302" title="Sheepdog trial">
<text>A sheepdog trial – also herding event, stock dog trial or simply dog trial — is a competition or test of the working abilities of dogs of herding breeds. It is a type of dog sport that emerged in the 1860s in New Zealand. By the 1870s regular trials were also being held in Australia and in the United Kingdom, and by the end of the twentieth century the sport had spread to many countries of the world. In competition, dogs demonstrate basic herding management skills assessed by the judge. These events are organised by international and national cynological and sports organisations and by associations of sheep- and cattle-breeders. Usually sheep are to be herded; other animals including ducks or cows may also be used. 

Competitions are divided into several levels of difficulty and may use various scoring systems. Rules vary concerning eligible breeds, numbers of dogs and which breeds of sheep are to be used. Most often, the competition programme includes guiding the sheep through several obstacles, collecting them in and out of the pen, separating the sheep from the flock, etc. The judge is evaluating the accuracy of the dog&#x27;s work under the guidance of a handler.

== History ==

The first dog trials were held in Wānaka, New Zealand, in 1867 with reports of trials at Wānaka, Waitangi and Te Aka in 1868, at Wānaka in 1869 and Haldon Station in the Mackenzie Country in 1870. Australia also has a long history of dog trials, with a Kelpie named Brutus reported in the local paper in Young, NSW, as winning a sheepdog trial in 1871.

At the same time, sheep herding began to develop as a competitive sport in the United Kingdom. The pursuit of sheepdog trialling had been well established since the 1870s in all regions of the UK: England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. At that time travel was difficult and people were less mobile, so sheepherding trials started as locally organised events.

The first recorded trials involving more than one country were held in 1873 in Bala, Wales. A handler from Scotland took first prize. The sport started to gain popularity rapidly and to develop and attract participants and spectators. William Wallace of Otterburn, Northumberland at the Hawick Trials of 1883 was credited with first demonstrating control of the dog &quot;with a mere hiss at hand and a low whistle at distance&quot;. Before then handling was very different: much waving, shouting and barking was involved.

Dogs with the right ‘eye’ for the task were bred and started do establish as a separate breed. In the 1890s Adam Telfer, of Cambo, Northumberland, bred and trained the dog that is considered the ‘father of the breed’ in border collies. His name was Old Hemp, he can be multiply traced in the pedigrees of most modern border collies. 

At the same time, early sheepdog societies were founded in north-west England and Wales. Their contribution to the development of herding breeds and trials is less well known but should be acknowledged.

=== Gathering herding style (border collie style) ===
The International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) organises trials of three levels of difficulty. Gathering style in herding is typical of the border collie breed, and until recently Australian kelpies were representing this style too, but got moved to traditional style in 2018. In gathering style the dog works under the guidance of a handler who is stationary during most of the programme. He handles the dog with verbal and gesture cues and uses a whistle. 

The test usually involves the dog running out to the sheep (outrun), encouraging the sheep to move, or lifting (lift), driving the sheep towards the handler (fetch) and away from the handler (drive) through one or more gates or obstacles. In the designated area, the dog must separate one or more sheep from the flock (shed, single), place the sheep in the pen (pen). 

The ISDS holds a World Championship once every three years. The eligibility of countries to participate and the number of participants from each country are determined based on the results of the regular competitions during qualifying period of three years. Individual and team competitions are held. For example, 238 participants from 29 countries were allowed to participate in the 2020 World Championship. And sheep – a hybrid of Bluefaced Leicester and Scottish black-faced sheep were raised specifically for the event.

=== Traditional herding style ===
The International Cynological Federation in addition to gathering style (Border Collie) established the rules for trials, tests and competitions in the traditional herding style that includes all other breeds from pastoral group except border collies. In traditional style competitions the handler is allowed to move with the dog on the field during the entire programme, and the difficulty level is determined by a set of exercises. In addition to obstacles of varying complexity (bridge, &quot;funnel&quot;, &quot;Maltese cross&quot;) and work in a pen, crossing the carriageway, loading into a trailer, etc. can be asked of a dog. 

Most popular breeds used for traditional style herding both in trials and every day farm work are the Pembroke Corgi, the Shetland Sheepdog, the Briard, the Australian Cattle Dog and Kelpie, the Smooth and Rough Collie and the Koolie. 

There are separate rules for testing dogs for the presence of herding instinct. The testing does not reveal the winner, but assesses the dog&#x27;s interest in sheep, the desire to work and the manner of interaction with the sheep, and the natural ability to find a balance point. Both traditional and gathering style dogs are eligible for this test in FCI.

==Trial field==

The exact layout of the trial field can vary significantly. Most experienced handlers agree that there are certain elements that are important to ensure that the challenge to the dog and handler is a fair and complete test. For USBCHA-sanctioned trials, these elements include:
* The dog must leave the handler and fetch sheep that are some distance away
* The dog must take control of the sheep and bring them to the handler
* It is against the dog&#x27;s instinct to drive the sheep away from the handler so an &quot;away drive&quot; is a good test and should be included
* The dog and handler should be able to combine to move the sheep into a confined space, typically a pen but in some trials they are asked to load them onto a vehicle.
Other popular test elements that are often added include:
* The dog must separate the group into two groups in a controlled way in accordance with the instructions from the judge. This may involve some sheep being marked and the dog and handler working together to separate them from the rest or some variation of that. This is known as &quot;shedding&quot; and is almost always required to be done in a ring marked out on the ground.
* &quot;Singling&quot; is another test in which the dog and handler combine to separate one sheep from the group.
* Most trials include a &quot;cross drive&quot; where the dog is required to move the sheep in a controlled way in a straight line from one side of the field to the other in front of the handler but some distance away from them.

In addition there are various elements that may be added to increase the level of difficulty of a trial. One such example is the &quot;double lift&quot; where the dog is required to fetch one group of sheep, bring them to the handler, look back and find another group, somewhere else on the trial field some distance away. They must then leave the first group and do a second outrun to fetch the others and bring them to join the first group.

In most competitions the dog will be required to do the fetching and driving tests on their own. During these test elements the handler must remain at a stake positioned during the layout of the trial course. During the shedding, singling and penning the handler usually leaves the stake and works with the dog to achieve the task.

===Scoring===
The most popular scoring system works as follows:
* A judge watches each run and assigns a score based on their judgment.
* Each test element is assigned a maximum score. For example there may be 10 points for the cast (outrun) and so on.
* Each competitor is assigned the full amount for each element before they start.
* As they negotiate each test element a judge deducts points for each fault. For example during a drive the judge may deduct points when the sheep move off line. During each element they can only lose as many points as are assigned to that element.
* They must negotiate each element in sequence before proceeding to the next.
* A set amount of time for the whole course, usually around 15 minutes, is decided on before the start of the trial.
* There is no advantage in completing the course in a short amount of time but if the competitor runs out of time then they will lose all the points for the element they were in the process of completing and all those that they have yet to attempt.
* The competitor&#x27;s score is the sum of their score for all completed elements.

For most elements the judge focuses on the behaviour of the sheep not the dog or handler. Dogs are judged on the efficiency of their work and on qualities of good stockmanship. A dog that needlessly harasses or hurries the sheep will penalized and a dog that bites a sheep may be disqualified.

This points type of system has been in use since at least 1979 and may have been formalized at about that same time.

<text>Manukau City was a territorial authority district in Auckland, New Zealand, that was governed by the Manukau City Council. The area is also referred to as &quot;South Auckland&quot;, although this term never possessed official recognition and does not encompass areas such as East Auckland, which was within the city boundary. It was a relatively young city, both in terms of legal status and large-scale settlement – though in June 2010, it was the third largest in New Zealand, and the fastest growing. In the same year, the entire Auckland Region was amalgamated under a single city authority, Auckland Council.

The name &quot;Manukau&quot;, originating from the Manukau Harbour west of the city, is of Māori origin, and means &quot;wading birds&quot;, although it has been suggested that the original name of the harbour was &quot;Mānuka&quot;, meaning a marker post with which an early chief is said to have claimed the area.

==History==
Manukau City was formed by the amalgamation of Manukau County and Manurewa Borough in 1965. The council originally housed their offices at the Nathan Estate (now the Auckland Botanic Gardens, until permanent offices were constructed.
=== Manukau County ===
Manukau County was reduced in size on the 1st April, 1912, with the southern portion of the county forming the new Franklin County.

In 1923, Manukau County covered and had a population of 6,146, with of gravel roads, of mud roads and of tracks.

==Geography==
The Manukau City area is concentrated immediately to the south of the Ōtāhuhu isthmus, the narrowest connection between Auckland City and the Northland region and the rest of the North Island. At its narrowest, between the Otahuhu Creek arm of the Tamaki River (itself an estuarial arm of the Hauraki Gulf) in the east and the Māngere Inlet (an arm of the Manukau Harbour) to the west, the isthmus is only some 1500 metres across.

The area to the south of the isthmus contains the heart of Manukau, sprawled on either side of state highways 1 and 20, the latter of which approaches from the west after crossing Māngere Bridge. The area known as Manukau Central is located close to the junction of these two highways, some 20 kilometres southeast of the centre of Auckland city.

Considerable rural and semi-rural land to the east of Manukau Central was within the city council district. This extended towards the Hunua Ranges close to the Firth of Thames, and took in such communities as Clevedon and Maraetai.

Beyond Manukau City to the south is Papakura and the Franklin District, which are less urban, but still part of the Auckland Region, and to some extent regarded as an integral part of Auckland&#x27;s urban area.

Auckland Airport is located in Māngere, in the west of Manukau, close to the waters of the Manukau Harbour. Manukau City includes the theme park Rainbow&#x27;s End, and one of the oldest shopping malls in the country, now called Westfield Manukau City.

==Transport==
In 2009, work started on the Manukau Branch passenger railway line from the North Island Main Trunk at Puhinui. The branch line opened on 15 April 2012 with Manukau railway station as the terminus for Eastern Line services. The Manukau Institute of Technology university campus building is built over the top of the station, which serves the Manukau city centre. On 7 April 2018, a 23-bay bus station (Manukau bus station) was opened on a lot adjacent to the train station to create a transport hub serving most of the southern Auckland Region.

==Population==
As of the late 2000s, slightly less than 50% of the city&#x27;s population identified as European, with 17% as Māori, 27% as Pacific, and 15% as Asian, with the balance made up of other groups.

==Schools==
==Administrative divisions==
Prior to being merged into Auckland Council in November 2010, Manukau City was divided into seven wards; each of them consisting of the following populated places (i.e.: suburbs, towns, localities, settlements, communities, hamlets, etc.):

<text>Millimeter-wave cloud radars, also denominated cloud radars, are radar systems designed to monitor clouds with operating frequencies between 24 and 110 GHz (Table 1). Accordingly, their wavelengths range from 1 mm to 1.11 cm, about ten times shorter than those used in conventional S band radars such as NEXRAD.

==Purpose==

=== Table 1: Millimetre cloud radar operating bands ===

The main purpose of these radars is the investigation of cloud properties and evolution. They typically operate at 35 GHz in the Ka band and at 94 GHz in the W band, where the atmospheric transmission is maximum. These frequencies correspond to wavelengths around 8 and 3 mm. Millimeter cloud radars have a high temporal and range resolution: temporal resolution is adjustable and typically ranges from 1 to 10 seconds, while the range resolution ranges from a few meters for cloud radars using frequency modulation of the transmitted signal (e.g. 4 m for the Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) 94 GHz cloud radar operating at UK Met Office), to several meters for magnetron based cloud radars (e.g. from 15 to 60 m for MIRA systems). The maximum detection range is between 14 and 20 km and the Doppler velocity resolution is of few cm/s. Most of the cloud radars are polarimetric, being able to measure the particles irregularity by means of the linear depolarization ratio (LDR). Usually they operate pointing to the zenith, but an increasing number of them have nowadays scanning units, that allow to retrieve additional information such as volume information when performing various Range Height Indicator (RHI) scans at different angles and at a relatively high speed, and vertical wind profiles, when performing plan position indicator (PPI) at few degrees from the zenith.

Regarding the different cloud radars operating wavelengths, it must be taken into account that longer wavelengths are less attenuated by drizzle and rain, while shorter wavelengths are more sensitive to smaller particles. Accordingly, radar signals are less attenuated in Ka-band than in W-band, while W-band radars are able to detect smaller particles. Even though, the cloud radar beams are much less attenuated by cloud or precipitation particles than the lidar beam.

Cloud radars are used nowadays to determine cloud boundaries (e.g. cloud bases and tops) and to estimate clouds microphysical properties, such as particle size and mass content, which aids in understanding how clouds reflect, absorb and transform radiant energy passing through the atmosphere. They are also intensively used to investigate fog. Furthermore, cloud radars are being used for entomology studies for more than 40 years, since Ka and W-band radars detect almost exclusively insect targets on warm cloudless days, and more recently are also used for the study of giant aerosols.

Even though most cloud radar systems are ground-based, they can also be airborne and space-based. Examples of airborne systems are cloud radars installed on HALO (High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft) and Wyoming KingAir Research Aircraft. An example of spaceborne Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) is operating in the CloudSAT satellite since 2006. The first spaceborne CPR with Doppler capability will be launched in March 2023 aboard the Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission.

== Measuring with a radar: from IQ to spectra ==

Pulsed Radar systems are considered active instruments because they transmit in the atmosphere an electromagnetic wave and receive the signal reflected back from the atmosphere. In such radars, the antenna sends out the electromagnetic wave, and then collects the returned signal. Radars are composed of different hardware parts, each of which contains different elements. The figure on page 9 in Clothiaux et al. 1996 is showing such units.

The electromagnetic wave sent in the atmosphere is an EM wave of the form shown in figure on page 10 of. Such wave is generated by an oscillator in the transmitter unit and then transferred through wave guides to the antenna, which radiates it in the atmosphere. The theory of propagating waves in rectangular shaped waveguides having a vertical axis of symmetry shows that by setting appropriate dimensions of the waveguide, the resulting electric field is propagating parallel to the interior space of the waveguide in the vertical direction, having a y sinusoidal in time component (transverse wave).

The expression of the electric field radiated at a distance formula_1 far from the antenna is, adopting complex notation in spherical coordinate system formula_2:

{r}e^{i(k_cr-\omega_c t)}U(t-2r/c)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_3 is the carrier frequency of the wave, formula_4 is the time, formula_5 is the speed of light, formula_1 is the distance from the antenna, formula_7 is the wavenumber and formula_8 is the wavelength, while formula_9 is the amplitude of the wave which depends on the power delivered to the antenna, on its characteristics and it is affected by the power losses in the waveguides. The function formula_10 is a modulating function which is 1 when its argument is between 0 and formula_11, and 0 elsewhere. Therefore, such electromagnetic (EM) field is oscillating sinusoidally in time within the pulse width formula_12 and is zero outside the pulse envelope, as shown in figure 3 on page 10 of. This EM wave is sent to the atmosphere: every pulse is scattered by a volume of air filled with hydrometeors and comes back to the radar. The antenna collects the returned signal, which is then filtered to remove the high carrier frequency, amplified and then downconverted and digitized.

The scattered electric field collected by the antenna is a composite of discrete echoes from all the scatterers contained in the volume and can be written as:

)}U(t-r/c)&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_13 is the amplitude of the electric field scattered by the mth scatterer, formula_14 is the position of the mth scatterer, formula_3 is the carrier frequency and formula_16 represents the shift in phase of the scattered wave in the direction of the radar due to the relative radial velocity of the target with respect to the radar, while formula_17 and formula_18 are respectively the phase shift upon scattering and the transmitter phase, which can be assumed constants
( formula_17 can depend on time for meteorological targets like vibrating water drops and tumbling ice particles).

As already mentioned, a weather signal is a composite of echoes coming from a very large number of hydrometeors. Such echoes are received continuously at the radar antenna after a delay equal to the time taken by the wave to reach the target and come back to the radar. Since individual echoes are impossible to be resolved individually, we sample the signal coming from the atmosphere at given discrete time delays formula_20.

Such formula_20 defines the range of the scatterers that contribute mostly to the sample of the signal. The number of distinct resolution volumes in space from which the radar collects information is equal to the number of samples formula_22 that are collected by the radar between any two radar pulses. The expression of the sampled received voltage is:

For every range gate ( formula_20) and for every pulse cycle ( formula_24), the so-called I and Q voltages are derived taking the real and imaginary part of the complex voltage given in (): Their expressions are:

Therefore, after such sampling of the received signal, a time serie of I/Q signals is associated to every range gate.

As radar transmits coherent pulses with a certain pulse repetition frequency (PRF), the doppler processing technique is applied. A Power spectrum can be calculated from a sequence of formula_25 components in the following way. In every range gate the FFT algorithm is applied to the serie of formula_26 IQ signals, where formula_26 is the number of FFT points used in the FFT. The result of the FFT is a complex spectrum formula_28 where formula_29 is the Doppler frequency. The power spectra is then easily estimated by

Such spectra is the distribution of radial velocities of the targets in the volume analyzed weighted with the power of the signal.

== The Doppler spectra ==

Usually numerous targets are present in the sample volume of the radar. Each of the individual targets produces a frequency shift according to its radial velocity. Measuring
the returned power in any interval of the frequency shift allows the detection of the Doppler spectrum. This is illustrated in the Figure on the right, where a sketch of the Doppler spectrum is shown. The frequency is already converted into velocity in the x axis.

From the Doppler spectrum the reflectivity formula_30 can be calculated using the expression:

^{v_{max}} S(v_{d}) dv_{d}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

The integral of the spectral power formula_31 is called the 0-moment of the Doppler spectrum, which equals the reflectivity formula_30. Further, the first moment () and the second moment () of the Doppler spectrum can be calculated:

^{v_{max}} v_{d} S(v_{d}) dv_{d}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

^{v_{max}} (v_{d} - V)^{2} S(v_{d}) dv_{d}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

The first moment of the Doppler spectrum is the mean Doppler velocity formula_33. It corresponds to the mean radial velocity in the sampled volume.

The second moment is called the Doppler width formula_34. It corresponds to the variance of the Doppler spectrum. The Doppler width basically is a measure of the width of the spectrum of the detected velocities. It can also be a measure of the number of modes the targets size distribution has. A mono-modal distribution gives a small spectral width. A distribution that has several modes yields a larger spectral width, as illustrated in Figure 5. The spectral width is also influenced by turbulent motion of the targets in the sample volume: the spectral width increases with increasing turbulence.

The expressions to calculate the Kurtosis and the Skewness are coming out of mathematical statistics several formulations are used. Some of them can be found in the quoted literature in Kurtosis section.

=== Doppler velocity ===
Mean Doppler velocity can be seen as the mean frequency of a power spectrum (Doppler velocity) of the backscattered power.

Given the mean Doppler velocity (mean frequency of the power spectrum) of the measured volume along the line of sight – the radial velocity. For vertical measurements, the Doppler velocities is the sum of terminal velocity of particles, caused by gravity force, and air motions within the measured volume. Terminal velocity contains the information about microphysical properties of cloud particles. In order to obtain the terminal velocity from the cloud-radar observations, the influence of air motions that shift the spectrum have to be removed from the Doppler spectra, improving in this way the microphysics representativity. An approach to correct this shift is given by Kollias et al., improving the accuracy of the relation between the corrected Doppler velocity and the particle fall velocities.

=== Doppler width ===
The Doppler width, or Doppler spectrum width, is the standard deviation of the spectrum. Accordingly, small values stand for narrow spectra, while higher spectrum width corresponds to a bigger spreading of the hydrometeors over the velocity domain (frequency domain). Reasons for a higher width could be bi- or multiple-modal spectra. This means that the measured volume contains more than one hydrometeor population, which leads to two or more modes in the Doppler spectrum because of the different terminal velocities. A rapid change in Doppler width in combination with the mean Doppler velocity can also be used to separate two hydrometeor population.

Since the air motion in the atmosphere affects the Doppler width, this parameter provides information about turbulence within the measured volume. Up- and downdrafts slow down the terminal fall velocities and can decrease or increase the Doppler width. If the measurements are not done pointing to the zenith, the horizontal wind component influences the width as well. The knowledge of the actual wind components in the atmosphere can be used to correct the Doppler spectrum, so that the retrieved microphysical parameters can be improved and the uncertainties decreased.

=== Skewness ===
The skewness parameter of the Doppler spectrum describes the asymmetry of the spectrum with respect to a symmetric Gaussian distribution.

^{v_{max}} (v_{d}-V)^{3} |S(v_{d})|^{2}~\mathrm{d}v_{d}}{W^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This parameter relates the location of the spectrum peak in respect to the mean spectrum value. Therefore, a positive skewness value indicates that the peak is located to the left with respect to the mean. A negative skewed spectrum has its peak on the right side with respect to the spectrum mean. A value around zero indicates a symmetric spectrum. In this way, the shape of a Doppler gives information on changes of cloud microphysics or of dynamical changes within the measured volume. The higher the elevation of the radar is, the higher are the dynamical influences on this parameter. Because wind shears lead to a broadening of the Doppler spectrum width, they can lead to rapid changes in skewness as well. To be able to relate the change in skewness of the Doppler spectrum, the Doppler width should be cross-checked as well.

If the radar measurements are done vertically, the skewness of the Doppler spectrum gives information about measured cloud microphysics. The horizontal wind within the measured volumes cause only a shift of the whole spectrum within the Doppler domain. This means that the spectrum is shifted along the Doppler velocity axis but it did not influence the broadening of the spectra. So the changes in skewness give information 
about:

* if the minority of the hydrometeors is falling faster or slower as the mean Doppler velocity
* if the Doppler spectrum is dominated by small hydrometeors (slower than the mean) or bigger particles (faster than the mean Doppler velocity)
* the shape of the size distribution of the measured hydrometeors
* changes over height or time can be related to a change in the cloud microphysics

=== Kurtosis ===
The kurtosis of the Doppler spectrum also relates to its curve. It describes the tails of the spectrum curve relative to Gaussian.

^{v_{max}} (v_{d}-V)^{4} |S(v_{d})|^{2}~\mathrm{d}v_{d}}{W^{4}}&lt;/math&gt;|}} 

Since the measure is dominated by the extremes, kurtosis can give information about the spectrum tail weight, helping to describe the spectrum better.

If a Doppler spectrum is exactly normally distributed, then its kurtosis equals 3.0. If in general the kurtosis is &gt;3, then the spectrum is called leptokurtic, or leptokurtotic.
It can be assumed that the Doppler spectrum is dominated by one single particle population that leads to a strong and narrow peak, which in some (but not all) cases is indicated by high kurtosis. If the spectrum has kurtosis &lt;3 then it is called platykurtic, or platykurtotic. The shape of such a spectrum (in some cases) may have a lower, wider peak around the mean and thinner tails, but it can also be infinitely peaked, so kurtosis is not a good measure of &quot;peakedness.&quot; Examples of such shapes can be found in the kurtosis wiki entry.

The Doppler radar kurtosis analysis started quite recently, so there are still few scientific publications dealing with this parameter. An example can be found in Kollias et al., where kurtosis is used to interpret Doppler spectra and to understand the microphysical changes that it represents.

== Polarimetric measurements in cloud radars ==
Polarimetric methods are considered to be a powerful tool in the remote sensing of the atmosphere, and particularly in radar observations of clouds and precipitation. Polarimetric techniques have been well developed for operational use in weather radar networks such as American NEXRAD and European OPERA, and, currently, are being implemented in ground based and airborne cloud radars. These techniques enable advanced clutter filtering, discrimination between meteorological and non-meteorological targets, and classification of atmospheric scatterers. Another potential of polarimetric measurements of cloud radars is the estimation of ice crystals habit that is one of the main problems in remote observations of mixed-phase clouds. The assumed shape of ice crystals is considered to be the main source of errors in size and number concentration retrievals based on vertical combined lidar and radar observations. Furthermore, in the existing numerical weather prediction models the assumed shape defines the depositional growth rate of ice particles and the area-mass-terminal velocity relations of ice crystals. Thus, ice habit can lead to significant uncertainties.

A number of different polarimetric configurations were evaluated in theoretical and experimental studies&lt;ref name=&quot;Matrosov/Kropfli1993&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and are explained below.

Most of the existing pulse cloud radars operate in the LDR-mode. In this mode, a radar transmits a horizontally polarized radiation and receives horizontal and vertical components of the scattered radiation in co-polarized and cross-polarized channels, respectively. The ratio of the power in the cross-polarized channel over the power in the co-polarized channel, named as linear depolarization ratio, is the polarimetric variable obtained by cloud radars of this type. Often cloud radars have two receiving units, which allows simultaneous measurements of the orthogonal components of the received signal. Some cloud radars have only one receiving unit and measure the orthogonal components consequently, with pulse-to-pulse switching of the receiving channel. Many of operational cloud radars with LDR-mode are pointed vertically together with other remote sensing instruments in order to retrieve microphysical properties of cloud particles. LDR, measured by vertically pointed cloud radar, is used for the detection of the melting layer (also denominated as bright band) and clutter filtering. The application of LDR-mode for the shape classification in scanning cloud radars is limited by its high sensitivity to the orientation of scatterers.

Some cloud radars operate in the SLDR-mode, that is a modification of traditional LDR-mode. In this mode the antenna system of the radar is rotated by 45°, i.e. the transmitted signal has +45° or -45° polarization. In contrast to LDR-mode, SLDR-mode is less sensitive to the particles orientation and, therefore, it is used in cloud radars for the classification of ice crystals. Determination of ice crystals&#x27; habit by ground based cloud radars requires elevation scanning and is based on analysis of the angular changes of the polarimetric variables. Evaluation of SLDR with in-situ observations showed the possibility to discriminate between rounded graupel, dendrite crystals, and aggregated ice particles.

Polarization-agile cloud radars use pulse-to-pulse switching between horizontal and vertical polarization state of the transmitted wave. In addition to LDR, such systems are able to measure differential reflectivity (&quot;ZDR&quot;) and correlation coefficient (&quot;ρHV&quot;). The combined analysis of LDR, &quot;ZDR&quot;, and &quot;ρHV&quot; can be used not only for classification of ice particle habit but also for characterization of their orientations.

CDR-mode cloud radars transmit a circularly polarized wave and receive co-polarized and cross-polarized components.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martner/Moran2001&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The output polarimetric variable is the so-called circular depolarization ratio (CDR), and it is calculated as the ratio of cross-polarized power over the co-polarized power. In comparison with LDR, CDR is not affected by particles aligned in polarization plane, e.g. insects or ice crystals in electrified atmospheric conditions.

== Measurement example ==

As the cloud radars sample the atmosphere, they measure the backscatter signal produced by different hydrometeor types (cloud droplets, drizzle, rain drops, ice particles, snow, etc.) and non-hydrometeorological targets. All these targets have different vertical velocities and shapes, and therefore the Doppler spectra and LDR can be used to distinguish between targets. In the figure below, an example of the MIRA-36 cloud radar measurements in Potenza is shown, where using the information given by the different parameters, an identification of targets can be done:

* Liquid water clouds produce a signature in the reflectivity but not in the LDR, since the liquid droplets are almost spherical.
* Ice clouds are characterized by relatively high LDR signals due to their irregular shapes.
* Insects produce high LDR values and are usually within the Convective Boundary Layer (CBL), where up- and downdrafts are observed continuously.
* The melting layer can be identified by an enhancement of the LDR, which is caused by irregular ice particles coated by liquid water during the phase transition.
* Rain is characterized by high reflectivity values, high falling velocities and a broadening of the spectra.
* Liquid layers within mixed-phase clouds can be detected by slightly higher peak width values, in accordance to the higher turbulence within.

== Cloud radar systems ==

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and Prosensing Inc. designed the Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (SACR) to monitor clouds overhead at various testing sites of the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s atmospheric radiation measurement program. The radars operate continuously at these sites in Oklahoma, Alaska and the tropical western Pacific Ocean, and are designed to function for at least ten years with minimal staff oversight. The SACR s operate at a frequency of 35 and 94 GHz, being designated as KaSACR and WSACR respectively.

Since the late 2000s, a meteorological 35.5 GHz Ka-band commercial cloud radar (MIRA-36) designed by METEK GmbH in collaboration with the Institute for Radio Astronomy, Kharkov (Ukraine) is in the market. Nowadays, there are eleven systems monitoring the cloud properties continuously in different sites, most of them in Europe. Cloudnet, a network of stations for the continuous evaluation of cloud and aerosol profiles in operational NWP models, assimilates their data, as well as data acquired by other instruments in the various sites with this purpose.

Outside of these networks, some research sites are also operating cloud radars. For example, at the Chilbolton Observatory (UK), two mm-wavelength radars are operating
continuously at 3.2 and 9 mm for the study of insects migrations, while a 35 GHz cloud radar is operating in Cabauw (the Netherlands).

<text>Soyuz 18 (, &quot;Union 18&quot;) was a 1975 Soviet crewed mission to Salyut 4, the second and final crew to man the space station. Pyotr Klimuk and Vitaly Sevastyanov set a new Soviet space endurance record of 63 days and the mark for most people in space simultaneously (seven) was tied during the mission.

== Mission highlights ==
The Soyuz 18 crew were the back-up crew for the failed Soyuz 18a mission, carried out that mission&#x27;s objectives, and continued the work of the previous Soyuz 17 crew. Klimuk and Sevastyanov were launched into space on 24 May 1975 and docked with Salyut 4 two days later. The crew quickly set to performing experiments and fixing or replacing equipment. A spectrometer was repaired, a gas analyzer was replaced, and a pumping condenser in the water regeneration system was switched with a hand pump.

On 29 and 30 May 1975, biological and medical experiments were performed and the Oasis garden was started. Studies of the stars, planets, Earth and its atmosphere were started on 2 and 3 June 1975. Some 2,000 photographs of the Earth and 600 of the Sun were reported taken.

More medical experiments were performed in June 1975, and attempts were made to grow plants, including onions. Experiments were carried out on insects, and experiments on varying the work schedule were carried out. Extensive medical experiments were carried out on 23 June 1975, as the crew surpassed the Soviet space endurance record of 29 days, set by Soyuz 17, the Salyut&#x27;s previous crew. The all-time record was held then by the Skylab 4 crew at 84 days.

On 3 July 1975, it was announced that the mission would last beyond the upcoming Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). To avoid any conflict of resources, the Soyuz 18 crew was controlled from the old Crimean Control Center, while the ASTP Soyuz 19 mission would be controlled from the Kaliningrad Control Center. The Crimean center had not been used since the Soyuz 12 flight. This was the first time the Soviets had to control two unrelated space missions.

The ASTP crews were launched 15 and 16 July 1975, and the Soyuz 18 crew communicated with the Soyuz 19 crew on two brief occasions. The total of seven people in space tied the record set by the Soyuz 6, Soyuz 7 and Soyuz 8 flights of 1969. Once the American ASTP crew landed 24 July 1975, the Soviets had a near six-year monopoly on crewed space flights until the launch of the first Space Shuttle, STS-1, on 12 April 1981.

The Salyut living conditions were starting to degrade by July 1975, with the environmental control system failing, windows fogged over and green mold growing on the station walls. The crew donned exercise suits and increased their exercise period to over two hours a day, and on 18 July 1975 began to prepare the station for uncrewed flight. The Soyuz craft was activated on 24 July 1975 and the crew returned to Earth two days later, on 26 July 1975. It landed at 56 km at the East of Arkalyk, Kazakhstan. The cosmonauts exited the capsule under their own power, but it was two days before Klimuk could take a 10-minute walk, and a week before he made a full recovery.

Soyuz-18 Rock in Antarctica is named after the mission.

<text>John Ellis &quot;Jeb&quot; Bush (born February 11, 1953) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007. A member of the Bush political family, he was an unsuccessful candidate for president of the United States in the 2016 Republican primaries.

Bush, who grew up in Houston, was the second son of former president George H. W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush, and a younger brother of former president George W. Bush. He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned a degree in Latin American affairs. In 1980, he moved to Florida and pursued a career in real estate development. In 1987, Bush became Florida&#x27;s secretary of commerce. He served until 1988. At that time, he joined his father&#x27;s successful campaign for the presidency.

In 1994, Bush made his first run for office, losing the election for governor by less than two percentage points to the incumbent Lawton Chiles. Bush ran again in 1998 and defeated lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay with 55 percent of the vote. He ended up succeeding MacKay after Chiles died in office 23 days shy of his retirement. He ran for reelection in 2002, defeating Bill McBride and winning with 56 percent, to become Florida&#x27;s first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as governor, Bush pushed an ambitious Everglades conservation plan, supported caps for medical malpractice litigation, launched a Medicaid privatization pilot program, and instituted reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice.

Bush announced his presidential candidacy on June 15, 2015. He suspended his campaign on February 20, 2016, shortly after the South Carolina primary, and endorsed Senator Ted Cruz on March 23, 2016. He was critical of President Donald Trump during the 2016 campaign, and has remained so during Trump&#x27;s presidencies.

==Early life==
Jeb Bush was born on February 11, 1953, in Midland, Texas. When he was six years old, the family relocated to the Tanglewood neighborhood of Houston, Texas. The nickname &quot;Jeb&quot; is composed of his initials J.E.B. (John Ellis Bush).

He grew up with two younger brothers, Neil and Marvin, one younger sister, Dorothy, one older brother, George, who is seven years older, and, for the first eight months of his life, an older sister, Robin. Jeb Bush initially attended Grady Elementary School in Houston. Following in the footsteps of his father and older brother George, at the age of 14 years in late 1967, Bush began attending high school at the Andover, Massachusetts boarding school Phillips Academy, Andover. Bush completed ninth grade in Houston, but was advised to repeat it at Andover, and was nearly expelled due to poor grades. Bush recreationally used marijuana, hashish, and cigarettes during his high school years, although he made the honor roll by the end of his senior year and served as captain of the tennis team.

At the age of 17, Bush taught English as a second language and assisted in the building of a school in Ibarrilla, a small village outside of León, Guanajuato, Mexico, as part of Andover&#x27;s student exchange summer program. While in Mexico, he met his future wife, Columba Garnica Gallo.

Bush, who had largely avoided criticizing or supporting the Vietnam War, registered for the draft after his graduation from high school in 1971. In the fourth and final draft lottery drawing, on February 2, 1972, for men born in 1953 and to be inducted during 1973, Bush received a draft number of 26 on a calendar-based scale that went to 365. But no new draft orders were issued after 1972, because the U.S. changed to an all-volunteer military beginning in 1973.

Though many in his family had attended Yale University, Bush chose to attend the University of Texas at Austin, beginning in September 1971. He played on the Texas Longhorns varsity tennis team in 1973. Bush graduated Phi Beta Kappa and &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Latin American studies. He completed his coursework in two and a half years.

==Early career==
In 1974, Bush went to work in an entry-level position in the international division of Texas Commerce Bank, which was founded by the family of James Baker. In November 1977, he was sent to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to open a new operation for the bank, where he served as branch manager and vice president.

Following the 1980 presidential election, Bush and his family moved to Miami-Dade County, Florida. He took a job in real estate with Armando Codina, a 32-year-old Cuban immigrant and self-made millionaire. Codina had made a fortune in a computer business, and then formed a new company, The Codina Group, to pursue opportunities in real estate. During his time with the company, Bush focused on finding tenants for commercial developments. Codina eventually made Bush his partner in a new development business, which quickly became one of South Florida&#x27;s leading real estate development firms. As a partner, Bush received 40% of the firm&#x27;s profits. In 1983, Bush said of his move from Houston to Miami: &quot;On the personal side, my mother-in-law and sister-in-law were already living here.&quot; On the professional side, &quot;I want to be very wealthy, and I&#x27;ll be glad to tell you when I&#x27;ve accomplished that goal.&quot;

During Bush&#x27;s years in Miami, he was involved in many different entrepreneurial pursuits, including working for a mobile phone company, serving on the board of a Norwegian-owned company that sold fire equipment to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, becoming a minority owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, buying a shoe company that sold footwear in Panama, and getting involved in a project selling water pumps in Nigeria.

Bush was a lobbyist for Miguel Recarey, who ran International Medical Centres (IMC), a Florida-based health maintenance organization (HMO). Recarey &quot;employed&quot; Bush as a real estate consultant and paid him a 75,000 fee for finding the company a new location, although the move never took place. Bush did, however, lobby the Reagan administration vigorously and successfully on behalf of Recarey and IMC to waive a rule of Medicare enrollee proportion. Recarey received US$781 million in Medicare payments for 197 000 enrollees but did not pay doctors and hospitals for their care. As of 2015 Recarey was a fugitive living in Spain. The IMC fraud was one of the largest in Medicare history.

==Early political career==

Bush volunteered for his father&#x27;s campaigns in 1980 and 1988. During the 1980 campaign, Bush worked as an unpaid volunteer, and expressed great admiration for his father. In the mid-1980s, Bush got his start in Florida politics as the chairman of the Dade County Republican Party. Dade County played an important role in the 1986 election of Bob Martinez to the governor&#x27;s office. In return, Martinez appointed Bush as Florida&#x27;s Secretary of Commerce. He served in that role from 1987 to 1988, before resigning to work on his father&#x27;s presidential campaign.

Bush frequently communicated with his father&#x27;s staff from 1981 through 1992. The younger Bush recommended Dexter Lehtinen for the post of U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and set up a meeting between the Bush Administration and Motorola. He also advocated for Cuban exiles living in South Florida, and supported the Cuban embargo. In 1990, Bush urged his father to pardon Orlando Bosch, a Cuban exile who had been convicted of firing a rocket into a Polish ship which was on passage to Cuba. Bosch was released from prison and granted residency in the U.S.

In 1989, Bush was the campaign manager of Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American to serve in Congress, in her special election.

==1994 gubernatorial bid==
In 1994, Bush launched an unsuccessful bid for the governor&#x27;s office against incumbent Democratic governor Lawton Chiles. Bush ran that year as a conservative. At one point, he was asked what he would do for African Americans, and Bush responded: &quot;It&#x27;s time to strive for a society where there&#x27;s equality of opportunity, not equality of results. So I&#x27;m going to answer your question by saying: probably nothing.&quot; Bush led through much of the campaign. Then with just a few weeks before election day, Bush ran a campaign ad featuring the mother of a 10-year-old girl who had been abducted and murdered many years before. The ad opened with pictures of the girl and then shifted to her mother who gave a description of her daughter&#x27;s case and then said &quot;Her killer is still on death row and we&#x27;re still waiting for justice. We won&#x27;t get it from Lawton Chiles because he&#x27;s too liberal on crime. . . Lawton Chiles has let us down. . . I know Jeb Bush. He&#x27;ll make criminals serve their sentences and enforce the death penalty. Lawton Chiles won&#x27;t.&quot; The ad caused a storm of controversy. Florida prosecutors and former Supreme Court justices toured the state with Chiles saying that Bush didn&#x27;t know what he was talking about. It was compared, including by a rankled Chiles, to the Willie Horton ad run on behalf of Bush&#x27;s father in 1988. Bush further caused himself problems after being asked by reporters shortly after the ad started airing if signing death warrants immediately would have changed the outcome of the case by saying &quot;No.&quot; With polls showing that voters had doubts about Bush&#x27;s integrity, Chiles began pounding on the theme that Bush could not be trusted. In every commercial, no matter what the subject, Chiles ended with the tagline: &quot;That&#x27;s why we can&#x27;t trust Jeb Bush with our future.&quot;

At the candidates last debate, the only one of the campaign held in prime time, moderator Tim Russert asked Bush how he could continue to justify running the ad that was &quot;by your own admission, misleading.&quot; Bush responded that the ad was no longer being aired because it had &quot;completed,&quot; but that he would have kept it on the air longer. He tried to justify running it by saying that Chiles was in his opinion, &quot;liberal on crime,&quot; and hadn&#x27;t yet acted on some other death warrants. Chiles said when it was his turn to respond that he had supported the death penalty all his life and that he had executed as many people as governor, eight, as the previous two administrations; that &quot;as Governor, I hold the phone as they walk into the death chamber, I give the last command before they pull the switch.&quot; And then he said: &quot;You put on this ad, Jeb. You knew it was false. You even admitted it was false. . . I&#x27;m ashamed that you would use the agony of a mother and the loss of her daughter in an ad like this. It&#x27;s demagoguery, pure and simple. Every paper in the state has looked at that ad; everyone of them has said it is a new low. Your father had the record in the Willie Horton ad, but you&#x27;ve outdone that. And Jeb, I&#x27;ll tell you how long you ran that ad, you ran that ad til&#x27; your polls started telling you you were taking a beating on it, and you still are taking a beating on it! It was a mistake, you shouldn&#x27;t have done it,&quot; as whoops and applause rang out from Chiles partisans in the audience (incidentally, the girl in the ad&#x27;s convicted killer would not be executed until 2013, during the administration of Governor Rick Scott).

Bush lost the election by only 63,940 votes out of 4,206,076 that were cast for the major party candidates (2,135,008; 51% to 2,071,068; 49%). In the same election year, his older brother, George, was elected Governor of Texas. Following his election loss, Bush joined the board of the Heritage Foundation and continued to work with Codina Partners. Alongside T. Willard Fair, the president of the Urban League&#x27;s Miami affiliate, Bush helped to establish Florida&#x27;s first charter school.

==Governor of Florida==

Bush ran again for governor in 1998, defeating Democrat Buddy MacKay, who was lieutenant governor. Bush ran for reelection in 2002 to become Florida&#x27;s first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as governor, Bush was credited with initiating environmental improvements, such as conservation in the Everglades, supporting caps for medical malpractice litigation, moving medicaid recipients to private systems, and instituting reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice. Bush was governor when his brother George won an intensely fought election recount in Florida to become president. Bush recused himself from any official role in the recount.

===1998 election bid===

In 1998, Bush defeated his Democratic opponent, Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay, by over 418,000 votes (2,191,105; 55 percent to 1,773,054; 45 percent) to become Governor of Florida. He campaigned as a &quot;consensus-building pragmatist&quot;. Simultaneously, his brother, George W. Bush won a re-election victory for a second term as Governor of Texas, and they became the first siblings to govern two states simultaneously since Nelson and Winthrop Rockefeller governed New York and Arkansas from 1967 to 1971.

In the 1998 election, Bush garnered 61 percent of the Hispanic vote and 14 percent of the African American vote.

===2002 re-election bid===

Bush was unopposed in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary, and in the general election he faced Democratic challenger Bill McBride. They met for two debates, in the most expensive Florida gubernatorial election yet. Voting went smoothly. Bush defeated McBride 56 percent to 43 percent, a greater margin of victory than in 1998.

Bush won 44 percent of the state&#x27;s Jewish vote in the 2002 race. Bush also won the white female vote in the swing-voting battleground of Central Florida&#x27;s I-4 corridor. However, he was not able to replicate the same success with African American voters (like he had earlier in 1998), winning only 8 percent of the African American vote. He became the first Republican governor of Florida to win re-election.

===Tenure===
====Economic policy====
While governor, Bush presided over a state government that reduced taxes by 19 billion and he vetoed 2 billion in new spending, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. An analysis conducted by economist Martin Sullivan, which eliminated the effects of the federal estate tax repeal (which did not require legislative action to go into effect) and inflation, estimated the cumulative reduction in taxes by the state at closer to 13 billion during Bush&#x27;s tenure, resulting in tax savings by 2006 of 140 per person, per year. A substantial amount of the tax savings in the higher estimate came from the phasing out of the federal estate tax law implemented in 2001 under President George W. Bush, for a total tax savings of 848 million per year; Jeb Bush did not push for a replacement with a state tax. The biggest reduction in taxes was due to the elimination of the state&#x27;s Intangible Personal Property Tax, which applied to holdings of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds.

During Bush&#x27;s tenure, the state also increased its reserves from 1.3 billion to 9.8 billion, which coincided with Florida receiving the highest possible bond rating for the first time. According to Kurt Wenner, VP of research at Florida Tax Watch, Bush was governor during one of the strongest revenue periods for the state of Florida, due in part to the boom in property values, so that revenue grew despite the tax cuts he implemented.

Bush reduced the state&#x27;s government workforce by 11 percent. In May 2006, as part of a 448.7 million line-item veto of state funding, he cut a total of 5.8 million in grants to public libraries, pilot projects for library homework help and web-based high-school texts, and funding for a joint-use library in Tampa.

As Governor of Florida, Bush received grades of B in 2000, A in 2002, B in 2004, and C in 2006 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America&#x27;s governors.

====Education policy====
Bush&#x27;s administration emphasized public education reform. His &quot;A+ Plan&quot; established heightened standards, required testing of all students, and graded all Florida schools. From 1998 to 2005, reading scores of 4th grade students in Florida on the National Assessment of Educational Progress increased 11 points, compared to 2.5 points nationally, according to the Maine Heritage Policy Center, a conservative think tank which opposes standardized testing.

Bush has been a proponent of school vouchers and charter schools, especially in areas of the state with failing public schools, although to date very few schools have received failing grades from the state. He established the McKay Scholarship Program which provides vouchers for students with learning disabilities to attend a school of their choice. He also established the A+ Opportunity Scholarship Program which provided vouchers to students. This program was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court in 2006.

Bush helped create the Corporate Income Tax Credit Scholarship which provides corporations with tax credits for donations to Scholarship Funding Organizations. Those organizations must spend 100% of the donations on scholarships for low income students.

Bush declined to raise taxes for education, which led him to oppose a ballot initiative to amend the Florida Constitution to cap growing school class sizes. Bush said he had &quot;a couple of devious plans if this thing passes&quot;. Despite his opposition, the amendment passed.

In higher education, Bush approved three new medical schools during his tenure and also put forth the &quot;One Florida&quot; proposal, an initiative that had the effect of ending affirmative action admissions programs at state universities. These moves were among the concerns that led to the faculty of the University of Florida to deny Bush an honorary degree, while the University of Florida Alumni Association made him an honorary alumnus.

====Health policy====
As governor, Bush proposed and passed into law major reform to the medical liability system. The Florida Senate, a majority of which were Republican, opposed Bush&#x27;s proposed caps on non-economic damages for injury and wrongful death. Bush insisted, and called the legislature into five special sessions. The contentious debate even included a senior Bush staffer calling for primary opposition to Republicans who disagreed with the Governor on the reforms. Eventually, the legislature agreed to the caps and Bush&#x27;s reforms passed. In 2014, after Bush left office, the Florida Supreme Court ruled the damage cap – the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of the 2003 legislation that Bush had pushed for – to be a violation of the state Constitution&#x27;s equal protection clause, discriminating against &quot;those who are most grievously injured, those who sustain the greatest damage and loss, and multiple claimants.&quot;

Bush passed a reform to Florida&#x27;s Medicaid system that moved recipients into private managed care systems.

Bush was involved in the Terri Schiavo case, involving a woman with massive brain damage, who was on a feeding tube for over 15 years, and whose husband and legal guardian, Michael Schiavo, wished to remove the tube. This move was opposed by Terri Schiavo&#x27;s parents in the courts. Bush signed &quot;Terri&#x27;s Law&quot;, legislation passed by the Florida legislature that authorized him, as governor, to keep Schiavo on life support. The law was ruled unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court on September 23, 2004. That decision was appealed to the federal courts. On January 24, 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case, thus allowing the Florida court&#x27;s ruling to stand.

While Governor of Florida, Bush was opposed to abortion. He supported a law requiring parental notification for teen abortions and requested that the courts appoint a guardian for the unborn child of a mentally disabled woman who had been raped. Choose Life, a pro-life advocacy group based in Ocala, Florida, submitted a specialty license plate application—previously vetoed by Governor Lawton Chiles—which passed both houses and was signed into law by Bush on June 8, 1999.

====Other policies====

Bush signed legislation to restore the Everglades in 2000 as part of a 8 billion project in conjunction with the federal government. He also set aside over one million acres of land for conservation as part of a land purchase program.

In 2001, Bush eliminated civil service protection for over 16,000 state jobs, which had the effect of making it easier to fire employees in those positions. In addition, he issued an executive order which removed racial preferences in state contracting.

In 2004, Bush supported an unsuccessful bill to allow illegal immigrants to be issued drivers licenses by the state.

Bush supported more than a dozen new protections for gun owners. In 2005, he signed into law Florida&#x27;s stand-your-ground law, which was the first such state law in the United States.

Bush is an advocate of capital punishment and 21 prisoners were executed during his term. After the execution of Ángel Nieves Díaz was seemingly botched—it took 37 minutes to complete, and required a second injection of the lethal chemicals—he suspended all executions in Florida on December 15, 2006.

During Bush&#x27;s tenure, the racial and gender diversity of the state&#x27;s judicial bench increased. However, according to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, Democrats criticized some of Bush&#x27;s judicial appointments as being &quot;overtly partisan and political&quot;.

====Veto of high-speed rail and other vetoes====
Bush often used the line-item veto to limit state spending. He exercised his veto to stop other legislation as well (such as a bill about &quot;parenting coordinators&quot;).

In 1995, the Florida state legislature created the High-Speed Rail Authority (HSRA) and came up with a public-private partnership model. Government would build the system leveraging state dollars with federal funds and tax-free bonding. The private sector was to invest money in the project, help design and build the network, and be given the franchise to operate the trains (known as design-build-operate-maintain, or DBOM). Trains would be privately owned, similar to how the airline industry operates in a publicly financed airport.

The rail system and its planning was estimated to cost $7–$8 billion. The Florida HSRA and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) reached an agreement with a consortium that included the Fluor Corporation and Bombardier Transportation. The consortium agreed to invest $300 million and utilize the DBOM functionality. The state of Florida would float state bonds, and FDOT would commit $70 million annually (increasing three percent yearly to account for inflation) to service the bonds for the next thirty years. Federal monies would pay for the interest on the bonds, and the state monies would satisfy the principal. When the high-speed railroad was running, operating surpluses would also be applied to the debt.

The high-speed rail project nearly came to fruition until Bush became governor in 1999 and ended the project his second day in office, stating that the venture posed too much risk and cost for Florida taxpayers. State legislators reacted by adding the project on the 2000 ballot as a constitutional amendment which was ultimately passed by voters. The amendment directed Bush and legislature to start building the railroad system by 2003. Bush vetoed funding for both the project and the board, and led a high-profile campaign to repeal the constitutional requirement that mandated the construction of the high-speed system. Voters repealed the constitutional amendment. Many who voted believed they were supporting the train, though in fact a &quot;yes&quot; vote was to approve the repeal.

FDOT spokesperson Nazih Haddah commented that &quot;the rhetoric was inflammatory and misleading. It was really exaggerating tactics that were used to defeat this. The financing and the project were sound. It really squandered a great opportunity for this state.&quot; Other public officials stated that Bush&#x27;s underhanded tactics were emblematic of his willingness to protect moneyed interests – including developers, energy producers and highway builders – who opposed a shift toward mass transit and helped fund the repeal effort. &quot;It&#x27;s that arrogance of kind of the 1%,&quot; said Orlando transportation engineer Ian Lockwood.

====Public opinion polling====
According to &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, Bush averaged a 58 percent job approval rating during his eight years in office. He left office with a high partisan gap in his ratings: 70 percent among Republicans and 32 percent among Democrats. He also appealed to a vast majority of independents: 66 percent of those voters graded his governorship in the A or B tier.

In a November 1999 polling survey by the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Bush was rated &quot;excellent or good&quot; by 60 percent of Florida voters, rated &quot;fair&quot; by 26 percent of voters, and rated &quot;poor&quot; by ten percent of voters. In another polling survey by &quot;The Florida Voter&quot; in April 2000, Bush&#x27;s overall ratings dropped to 54 percent of voters approving and 31 percent disapproving of his governorship. A &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; survey in August placed Bush&#x27;s approval rating at 57 percent and disapproval rating at 24 percent. In June 2001, the month Bush announced he would run for a second term, his approval rating remained steady in the mid-50s. In August, a Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy survey saw Bush&#x27;s approval rating fall to 49 percent, the first time during his tenure that a majority of voters did not approve of his governorship. According to a polling survey conducted by &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; in January 2002, Bush was rated &quot;excellent or good&quot; by 58 percent of voters, rated &quot;fair&quot; by 27 percent of voters, and rated &quot;poor&quot; by 14 percent of voters.

In a March 2002 &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; polling survey, when voters were asked, &quot;do you approve or disapprove the job Jeb Bush is doing as governor&quot;, 56 percent of voters said they approved of Bush&#x27;s governorship, while 35 percent said they disapproved. A Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy survey in June 2002 found Bush with a 62 percent approval rating. In a July poll by &quot;The Florida Voter&quot;, 52 percent of voters said they approved of Bush, a heavy decline from the previous month. In an October survey by &quot;The Tarrance Group&quot;, Bush garnered an approval rating of 57 percent going into his reelection bid. The results of the election were almost an exact match to the poll, with Bush receiving 56 percent of the vote. In a &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; survey in June 2003, Bush was rated &quot;excellent&quot; by 14 percent of voters, rated &quot;good&quot; by 40 percent of voters, rated &quot;fair&quot; by 29 percent of voters, and rated &quot;poor&quot; by 9 percent of voters.

In an April 2004 survey by the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Bush was rated &quot;excellent or good&quot; by 54 percent of voters, rated &quot;fair&quot; by 23 percent of voters, and rated &quot;poor&quot; by 23 percent of voters. In an August polling survey by &quot;SurveyUSA&quot;, Bush garnered a 56 percent approval rating. After the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season concluded, a &quot;Strategic Vision&quot; survey saw his approval rating jump to 61 percent. In another &quot;SurveyUSA&quot; survey in September 2005, Bush&#x27;s approval rating declined to 53 percent. A Quinnipiac University polling survey conducted in November 2005 also concluded that Bush&#x27;s approval rating was at 53 percent. In a March 2006 survey by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy, Bush was rated &quot;excellent or good&quot; by 63 percent of voters, rated &quot;fair&quot; by 21 percent of voters, and rated &quot;poor&quot; by 16 percent of voters. In October 2006, the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; asked voters to grade Governor Bush by letter; in the poll 56 percent of voters graded Bush with an A or a B, 23 percent graded him with a C, 10 percent graded him with a D, and 7 percent graded him an F. In a November poll by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy, Bush&#x27;s approval rating reached its highest ever at 64 percent.

==Post-governorship==
===Impact on political party===

According to political scientist Susan MacManus from the University of South Florida, &quot;In Florida, [Bush is] still perceived as conservative, especially on fiscal issues and even on social issues.&quot;

Outside of Florida, fellow Republican leaders throughout the country have sought Bush&#x27;s aid both on and off the campaign trail. Bush&#x27;s out-of-state campaign visits include Kentucky, where Republican challenger Ernie Fletcher appeared with Bush and won that state&#x27;s governorship in 2003, ending a 32-year streak of Democratic governors. In the first few months of 2014, Bush campaigned for New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), and David Jolly who won a special congressional election in Florida.

Bush has been criticized by some in the Tea Party as not being sufficiently conservative, as he supports positions on immigration and Common Core that are unpopular with some conservatives. Bush publicly criticized the national Republican party for its adherence to &quot;an orthodoxy that doesn&#x27;t allow for disagreement&quot; on June 11, 2012. In comments shared with Bloomberg View, Bush suggested that Ronald Reagan and his father would &quot;have had a hard time&quot; finding support in the contemporary GOP.

In October 2013, Bush called for passage of immigration reform. In April 2014, Bush said of illegal immigration: &quot;It&#x27;s an act of love. It&#x27;s an act of commitment to your family. I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime. There should be a price paid, but it shouldn&#x27;t rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families.&quot;

===Political interests===
From 2004 to 2007, Bush served as a board member for the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). Created by Congress, the board&#x27;s purpose is to establish policy on reports examining K-12 students&#x27; academic progress in America&#x27;s public and private schools. Since then Bush&#x27;s education foundation has advocated for the Common Core State Standards Initiative. In October 2013, referring to opponents of the standards, Bush said that while &quot;criticisms and conspiracy theories are easy attention grabbers&quot;, he instead wanted to hear their solutions to the problems in American education.

In May 2006, Bush was approached to become the next commissioner of the National Football League. The outgoing commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, was searching for replacements. In response, Bush said on May 24, 2006, that &quot;I&#x27;m Governor of the state of Florida and I intend to be Governor until I leave—which is January 2007.&quot; Roger Goodell eventually became the new NFL commissioner.

In September 2024, Bush was one of several former governors to sign an open letter to all 50 current governors urging them to certify their states’ votes after the upcoming November election.

===Business activities===

According to Fox Business, Bush earned nearly half of the 29 million he earned between 2007 and when he decided to run for Republican presidential nomination in December 2014, from Wall Street banks and companies. In April 2007, Bush joined Tenet Healthcare&#x27;s board of directors. The following August, Bush joined investment bank, Lehman Brothers, as an adviser in its private equity group. Bush has also served on the board of InnoVida, Swisher Hygiene, and Rayonier and has served as an adviser to Barclays. Bush would later return 270,000 in consultancy fees he had been paid by InnoVida after they declared bankruptcy.

As of 2014, Bush had received more than 2 million from his work for Tenet, a company that expected to receive 100 million in new earnings in 2014 because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and that &quot;aggressively encouraged Americans to sign up for insurance under the program...&quot; Bush has reportedly objected to the ACA at company meetings, but has kept his personal views separate from what is best for Tenet. Bush owns several international stocks.

==2016 presidential campaign==
Bush had been considered a potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election since the end of the 2012 election. On October 2, 2014, George W. Bush said that his brother &quot;wants to be President&quot;. On December 16, 2014, Bush announced via Facebook that he would be &quot;actively exploring&quot; a 2016 run to become President of the United States and at the end of the year resigned from several corporate boards.

In February 2015, Bush released several thousand emails from his time as governor online. Most of the emails are in the public record under Florida&#x27;s Sunshine Laws. However, Bush created controversy by releasing some emails that included some personal details such as social security numbers, names, and addresses, as well as the contents of the messages. Bush&#x27;s campaign team subsequently redacted the personal information.

By extending the exploration mode of his potential candidacy to a six-month period (his scheduled announcement came one day short of six months into his exploratory phase), Bush used his time to get acquainted with the press, court donors, and prepare a strategy. In doing this, he navigated several campaign finance laws which limit donations and prohibit coordination with Super PACs. This included delaying his official announcement to run, in order to circumvent the cap on primary donations of $2,700 per individual. In May 2015, it was reported that Bush had been raising money since January 2015, estimated to be close to 100 million, for his super PAC, Right to Rise. 

Bush announced his candidacy on June 15, 2015, at a multicultural campus of Miami Dade College. According to &quot;Reuters&quot;, Bush characterized himself as a moderate Republican who still has conservative principles; he promised immigration reform, spoke fluent Spanish, mentioned his wife&#x27;s Mexican origins, and criticized Hillary Clinton. David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute, said: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty hard for [Republicans] to win the White House if current Hispanic voting trends continue. (Bush) has some unique abilities to appeal to those voters and he&#x27;s going to maximize them.&quot;

After a series of poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush spent his remaining money and campaign effort on the South Carolina primary. He placed fourth with under 8% of the vote. That night, Bush suspended his campaign, ending his presidential bid, and subsequently endorsed Texas senator Ted Cruz. In an analysis of what went wrong, &quot;Politico&quot; argues: &quot;His slow, awkward stumble from August through October encapsulates everything that caused the operation viewed as &#x27;Jeb!, Inc.&#x27; to fail. Bush was on the wrong side of the most galvanizing issues for Republican primary voters, he himself was a rusty and maladroit campaigner and his campaign was riven by internal disagreements and a crippling fear that left them paralyzed and unable to react to Trump.&quot; In May 2016, Bush announced he would vote neither for Trump nor Clinton.

==Political positions==
Bush has addressed myriad political issues over the course of his career, many of them during his governorship. In conjunction with his 2015 bid for the presidency, he has revisited many issues that he addressed before, as well as discussing many new ones.

===Domestic issues===
Bush believes abortions should only be legal in the case of rape or incest or if the life of the mother is in danger. He does not support public funding for abortion clinics.

Bush generally rejects the scientific consensus on climate change, which is that climate change is real, progressing, dangerous, and primarily caused by human activity. While he has stated that &quot;I think global warming may be real&quot;, he has claimed that &quot;it is not unanimous among scientists that it is disproportionately manmade&quot;, and said that &quot;What I get a little tired of on the left is this idea that somehow science has decided all this so you can&#x27;t have a view.&quot; &quot;National Journal&quot; wrote that Bush &quot;does not acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change&quot;.

Bush favors repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or &quot;Obamacare&quot;) and replacing it with a &quot;market-oriented&quot; alternative. Bush has called the current law a &quot;monstrosity&quot;, saying that it is &quot;flawed to its core&quot;. Bush has proposed some sort of state- or local-government funded &quot;catastrophic coverage&quot; system, in which &quot;if you have a hardship that goes way beyond your means of paying for it, ... the government is there or an entity is there to help you deal with that.&quot; After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA in &quot;King v. Burwell&quot; in June 2015, Bush stated that the decision was &quot;not the end of the fight&quot; against the law.

In 2015, Bush took the position that people in the United States illegally should have a path to legal status, but not a path to citizenship, and said that legal status and avoiding deportation should require immigrants to pay fines, get work permits, pay taxes, not receive government assistance, learn English, and not commit crimes. He supports tougher enforcement of immigration laws, including prosecution of businesses that try to hire illegal aliens.

Bush, an opponent of same-sex marriage, disagreed with the &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; Supreme Court decision, and believes that the issue should be decided by the states rather than by the federal government and that it is not a constitutional right. He holds that businesses should have the right to refuse to provide services for same-sex weddings on religious grounds. In July 2015, Bush said he supported lifting the military&#x27;s ban on allowing transgender people to openly serve in the military, so long as &quot;the military&#x27;s comfortable with this&quot; and it did not impact morale.

Overall, Bush is for expanding gun owners&#x27; rights. As Governor, Bush adopted a &quot;tough on crime&quot; approach. In the 1998 gubernatorial election, he ran on a 10-20-life platform which imposed stronger mandatory minimum sentences for individuals who used guns in crimes. Bush is a supporter of the death penalty. In his unsuccessful 1994 campaign for Florida governor, Bush promised to sign many more death warrants as governor. One of the &quot;central themes&quot; of Bush&#x27;s 1994 campaign was his proposal to shorten the appeals period in capital cases. During Bush&#x27;s term as governor, some 21 prisoners were executed. In 2015, Bush said he was conflicted about the death penalty. In his 1994 campaign, Bush proposed publishing the names of juvenile delinquents so the public would &quot;know who the thugs are in their neighborhoods.&quot; In 2002, Bush opposed a Florida ballot measure that would have allowed nonviolent drug offenders to enter treatment programs instead of prison. Bush&#x27;s then-24-year-old daughter had been arrested the same year on drug-related charges and underwent treatment.

Bush admitted smoking marijuana in his teenage years. &quot;Forty years ago I smoked marijuana and I admitted it,&quot; said Bush. &quot;I&#x27;m sure other people did it and didn&#x27;t want to admit it in front of 40 million people.&quot; He also agreed that his decision to take marijuana was &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;wrong.&quot; Bush believes each state should be allowed to decide whether it is appropriate to legalize marijuana or not. Bush opposes net neutrality. In September 2020, Bush told &quot;The Carlos Watson Show&quot; that he was interested in the concept of a universal basic income, as popularized by 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang.

===Economic issues===
Bush supports a decrease in capital gains taxes and property taxes. He supports cutting taxes for all Americans and believes they do better with less government interference. Bush also is a supporter of welfare restrictions. He supports the following: a four-year limit of benefits, a requirement that able-bodied recipients participate in work-related activities in order to receive benefits, and limiting benefits given to recipients if they have additional children while on welfare.

Bush favors gradually raising the retirement age (i.e., the age for collecting Social Security retirement benefits) from 65 to 68 or 70.

Bush is a frequent critic of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

===International relations and security===
In May 2015, Bush stated that he would have ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq had he been president at the time: &quot;I would have [authorized the invasion], and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody. And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got.&quot; He also indicated that the lack of focus on post-invasion security was a mistake. He later stated that &quot;knowing what we know now, ...I would not have engaged&quot;. &quot;I would not have gone into Iraq&quot;, he said. He also argued that the invasion—though perhaps inspired by faulty intelligence—had been beneficial, saying the world was &quot;significantly safer&quot; without Saddam Hussein in power.

In 2015, Bush said that he does not support a further major commitment of U.S. troops in Iraq to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS or ISIL), saying that such a deployment is not needed to defeat ISIS. He has not, however, ruled out such a deployment in the future. Bush favors building a new U.S. base in Iraq&#x27;s al-Anbar province, and has said that some U.S. troops ought to be embedded with Iraqi armed forces to help train them and identify targets as joint terminal attack controllers (JTACs). Bush has not commented on adding to the approximately 3,500 U.S. troops in Iraq now.

In a speech, Bush said his brother, former president George W. Bush, was his main adviser on policy with the Middle East. Bush later clarified that he was referring to policy on Israel, rather than on the Middle East as a whole.

Bush supports the continued collection of metadata of phone calls by the National Security Agency. He also supports the USA Patriot Act, and criticized efforts by Senator Rand Paul and others to stop its reauthorization. Bush stated that Paul was &quot;wrong&quot; about the Patriot Act and stated that: &quot;The Patriot Act has kept us safe, plain and simple. The metadata program has kept us safe, plain and simple. There&#x27;s been no violation of civil liberties.&quot;

Bush has called for increased military spending, expressing the belief that 2.5% of GDP is an insufficient amount.

Bush has called the April 2015 Iran nuclear deal framework a &quot;horrific deal&quot; and said he would likely terminate any final agreement should he become president. He has argued that the deal would put Iran into a position where it could intimidate the Middle East. Bush condemned the July 2015 final nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1 world powers, calling it &quot;appeasement.&quot; However, Bush stated that he would not seek to revoke the agreement on his first day in office.

Bush supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital. He tweeted: &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and I applaud @POTUS for seeing through America&#x27;s promise to relocate its embassy there. This is an important show of solidarity with Israel, one of our nation&#x27;s greatest allies.&quot;

==Civic and charitable activities==
After losing a 1994 election for Governor of Florida against Lawton Chiles, Bush pursued policy and charitable interests. He &quot;volunteered time to assist the Miami Children&#x27;s Hospital, the United Way of Dade County and the Dade County Homeless Trust&quot;.

Bush served from 2012 to 2015 as co-chair of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. He has also worked with The James Madison Institute (JMI), a free market public policy think tank based in Tallahassee, Florida. He helped the institute in numerous ways and still has his think tank working in conjunction with it. In June 2008, Bush&#x27;s Foundation for Excellence in Education partnered with JMI to hold a summit called Excellence in Action: A National Summit on Education Reform.

In 1996, The Foundation For Florida&#x27;s Future published a book that Bush had co-written, &quot;Profiles in Character&quot; (), a clear parallel to John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. The foundation also published and distributed policy papers, such as &quot;A New Lease on Learning: Florida&#x27;s First Charter School&quot;, which Bush co-wrote. Bush subsequently wrote the foreword to another book, published by the conservative Heritage Foundation and written by Nina Shokraii Rees, &quot;School Choice 2000: What&#x27;s Happening in the States&quot; ().

Bush co-founded the first charter school in the State of Florida: Liberty City Charter School, a grades K-6 elementary school. in a Miami neighborhood that, in 1980, was the site of the first major race riot since the Civil Rights era. The school&#x27;s co-founder, working alongside Bush, was T. Willard Fair, a local black activist and head of the Greater Miami Urban League. The Liberty City Charter School was closed in 2008 after falling more than 1 million in debt.

In 2000, Bush established the Points of Light program to recognize an &quot;exemplary volunteer, organization, or person&quot;.

Bush is the honorary chairman of the Annual AT&amp;T Jeb Bush Florida Golf Classic, a fundraiser that benefits the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. He first became involved in the benefit after meeting with committee member Lawson Dutton, whose child suffered from cystic fibrosis. Supporters raised more than 722,000 in 2014 at the 19th annual Jeb Bush Florida Classic, exceeding their goals in attendance and revenues raised. Since the event&#x27;s inception 19 years ago, the total revenue netted has reached over 7.478 million.

==Personal life==

In the city of León, Mexico, where he was teaching English during 1970 as part of a foreign exchange program, Bush met Columba Garnica Gallo. They were married on February 23, 1974, in Austin, Texas. As of 2014, the family residence is in Coral Gables, Florida. Bush is fluent in Spanish.

The Bushes have three children: George Prescott (born April 24, 1976, in Texas), went to Gulliver Preparatory School, studied at Rice University, and earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Texas School of Law. In the 2014 election, he was elected Commissioner of the Texas General Land Office. Noelle Lucila Bush (born 1977) is his only daughter. In November 2015, while campaigning in New Hampshire, Bush detailed Noelle&#x27;s struggles with drug abuse. His other son, Jeb Bush Jr. (born 1983), who attended Bolles School, works for a Miami, Florida, commercial real estate firm. Bush has four grandchildren, two through his elder son, and two through his younger son.

In 1995, Bush converted from Episcopalianism to Catholicism. In 2004, he became a Fourth Degree Knight of Columbus. Bush, a member of Father Hugon Council 3521 in Tallahassee, has joined the Father Hugon Assembly.

In April 2018, upon his mother Barbara Bush&#x27;s death, Bush delivered a eulogy on behalf of the family at her funeral.

<text>John Drake Sloat (July 26, 1781 – November 28, 1867) was a commodore in the United States Navy who, in 1846, claimed California for the United States.

==Life==
He was born at the family home of Sloat House in Sloatsburg, New York, of Dutch ancestry. He was orphaned at an early age, his father, Captain John Sloat, having been mistakenly shot and killed by one of his sentries two months before he was born, and his mother dying a few years later. 

Appointed midshipman in the Navy in 1800, he was sailing master of the frigate under Commodore Stephen Decatur during the War of 1812, and was promoted to lieutenant for conspicuous gallantry in the capture of the frigate . Sloat then commanded the schooner during which he fought the March 1825 naval campaign against the pirate ship of Roberto Cofresí. He later served on the ships and , and from 1828 commanded the sloop with the rank of master commandant, to which he had been promoted in 1826. He was promoted to captain in 1837, and from 1840 to 1844 was in charge of the Portsmouth Navy Yard.

=== California ===
In 1844 Sloat was appointed to command the Pacific Squadron, and in 1845, as tensions with Mexico grew, he was instructed to land in Alta California and claim it for the United States if war broke out. Receiving a report of fighting on the Texas border while off Mazatlán, he raced north (the British were reportedly interested in California too), engaged in a skirmish called the Battle of Monterey, raised the flag over the Customs House at Monterey on July 7, 1846, and issued a proclamation announcing that California was now part of the United States. He was a military Governor of California for only twenty-two days, before handing over the office to Robert F. Stockton.

Later, his poor health forced Sloat to take commands ashore, where he commanded the Norfolk Navy Yard 1847–1851, directed the construction of the Stevens Battery in 1855, and helped plan the Mare Island Navy Yard. He retired with the rank of captain in December 1861, and was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list in July 1866. Sloat was a Freemason, and belonged to Saint Nicholas lodge No. 321 in New York City. He died in New Brighton, New York, and was buried in Brooklyn&#x27;s Green-Wood Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Two destroyers were named in his honor as well as the World War II Liberty ship, the SS John Drake Sloat.

A memorial window dedicated to him was unveiled at St. Peter&#x27;s Chapel, Mare Island in 1907. Sloat was on the 1852 board that selected Mare Island to be the site of the first U.S. naval base on the Pacific.

The town, Sloat, California, in Plumas County, California was named for him in 1910.

A major street, Sloat Boulevard, and the Commodore Sloat Elementary School, both in San Francisco, California are named for him.

John Sloat Elementary School located in Sacramento, California is named for him.

Streets located in Monterey, California, East Garrison, California, Sacramento, California, and the Carthay Circle neighborhood of Los Angeles bear his name.

There is a monument erected in his honor on the Presidio of Monterey U.S. Army post.

His hometown of Sloatsburg, New York is named after his grandfather, Stephen Sloat.

<doc id="189327" wikidata="Q1848400" url="?curid=189327" title="SpiderMonkey">
<text>SpiderMonkey is an open-source JavaScript and WebAssembly engine by the Mozilla Foundation. The engine powers the Firefox web browser and has used multiple generations of JavaScript just-in-time (JIT) compilers, including TraceMonkey, JägerMonkey, IonMonkey, and the current WarpMonkey.

It is the first JavaScript engine, written by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications, and later released as open source and currently maintained by the Mozilla Foundation. Its design allows it to be embedded in applications beyond web browsers, with implementations including MongoDB database system, Adobe Acrobat, and the GNOME desktop environment.

== History ==
Eich &quot;wrote JavaScript in ten days&quot; in 1995,
having been &quot;recruited to Netscape with the promise of &#x27;doing Scheme&#x27; in the browser&quot;.
(The idea of using Scheme was abandoned when &quot;engineering management [decided] that the language must &#x27;look like Java.) In late 1996, Eich, needing to &quot;pay off [the] substantial technical debt&quot; left from the first year, &quot;stayed home for two weeks to rewrite Mocha as the codebase that became known as SpiderMonkey&quot;. (Mocha was the original working name for the language.)
In 2011, Eich transferred management of the SpiderMonkey code to Dave Mandelin.

===Versions===
==Standards==
SpiderMonkey implements the ECMA-262 specification (ECMAScript). ECMA-357 (ECMAScript for XML (E4X)) was dropped in early 2013.

==Internals==
SpiderMonkey is written in C/C++ and contains an interpreter, the WarpMonkey JIT compiler, and a garbage collector.

===TraceMonkey===
TraceMonkey was the first JIT compiler written for the JavaScript language. Initially introduced as an option in a beta release and introduced in Brendan Eich&#x27;s blog on August 23, 2008, the compiler became part of the mainline release as part of SpiderMonkey in Firefox 3.5, providing &quot;performance improvements ranging between 20 and 40 times faster&quot; than the baseline interpreter in Firefox 3.

Instead of compiling whole functions, TraceMonkey was a tracing JIT, which operates by recording control flow and data types during interpreter execution. This data then informed the construction of trace trees, highly specialized paths of native code.

Improvements to JägerMonkey eventually made TraceMonkey obsolete, especially with the development of the SpiderMonkey type inference engine. TraceMonkey is absent from SpiderMonkey from Firefox 11 onward.

===JägerMonkey===
JägerMonkey, internally named MethodJIT, was a whole-method JIT compiler designed to improve performance in cases where TraceMonkey could not generate stable native code. It was first released in Firefox 4 and eventually entirely supplanted TraceMonkey. It has itself been replaced by IonMonkey.

JägerMonkey operated very differently from other compilers in its class: while typical compilers worked by constructing and optimizing a control-flow graph representing the function, JägerMonkey instead operated by iterating linearly forward through SpiderMonkey bytecode, the internal function representation. Although this prohibits optimizations that require instruction reordering, JägerMonkey compiling has the advantage of being very fast, which is useful for JavaScript since recompiling due to changing variable types is frequent.

Mozilla implemented a number of critical optimizations in JägerMonkey, most importantly polymorphic inline caches and type inference.

The difference between TraceMonkey and JägerMonkey JIT techniques and the need for both was explained in a hacks.mozilla.org article. A more in-depth explanation of the technical details was provided by Chris Leary, one of SpiderMonkey&#x27;s developers, in a blog post . More technical information can be found in other developer&#x27;s blogs: dvander, dmandelin.

===IonMonkey===
IonMonkey was a JavaScript JIT compiler of Mozilla, which was aimed to enable many new optimizations that were impossible with the prior JägerMonkey architecture.

IonMonkey was a more traditional compiler: it translated SpiderMonkey bytecode into a control-flow graph, using static single assignment form (SSA) for the intermediate representation. This architecture enabled well-known optimizations from other programming languages to be used for JavaScript, including type specialization, function inlining, linear-scan register allocation, dead code elimination, and loop-invariant code motion.

The compiler can emit fast native code translations of JavaScript functions on the ARM, x86, and x86-64 platforms. It has been the default engine since Firefox 18.

===OdinMonkey===
OdinMonkey is the name of Mozilla&#x27;s new optimization module for asm.js, an easily compilable subset of JavaScript. OdinMonkey itself is not a JIT compiler, it uses the current JIT compiler. It&#x27;s included with Firefox from release 22.

===WarpMonkey===
The WarpMonkey JIT replaces the former IonMonkey engine from version 83. It is able to inline other scripts and specialize code based on the data and arguments being processed.
It translates the bytecode and Inline Cache data into a Mid-level Intermediate Representation (Ion MIR) representation. This graph is transformed and optimized before being lowered to a Low-level Intermediate Representation (Ion LIR). This LIR performs register allocation and then generates native machine code in a process called Code Generation.
The optimizations here assume that a script continues to see data similar what has been seen before. The Baseline JITs are essential to success here because they generate ICs that match observed data. If after a script is compiled with Warp, it encounters data that it is not prepared to handle it performs a bailout. The bailout mechanism reconstructs the native machine stack frame to match the layout used by the Baseline Interpreter and then branches to that interpreter as though we were running it all along. Building this stack frame may use special side-table saved by Warp to reconstruct values that are not otherwise available.

==Use==
SpiderMonkey is intended to be embedded in other applications that provide host environments for JavaScript. An incomplete list follows:
* Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, and other applications that use the Mozilla application framework
**Forks of Firefox including the Pale Moon, Basilisk and Waterfox web browsers.
*Data storage applications:
**MongoDB moved from V8 to SpiderMonkey in version 3.2
**Riak uses SpiderMonkey as the runtime for JavaScript MapReduce operations
**CouchDB database system (written in Erlang). JavaScript is used for defining maps, filters, reduce functions and viewing data, for example in HTML format.
*Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash Professional, and Adobe Dreamweaver. Adobe Acrobat DC uses Spidermonkey 24.2 with ECMA-357 support forward ported.
* GNOME desktop environment, version 3 and later
* Yahoo! Widgets, formerly named Konfabulator
* FreeSWITCH, open-source telephony engine, uses SpiderMonkey to allow users to write call management scripts in JavaScript
* PythonMonkey uses SpiderMonkey to allow users to write programs where JavaScript and Python functions, types, and events interoperate and (where possible) share memory storage. 
* The text-based web browser ELinks uses SpiderMonkey to support JavaScript
* Parts of SpiderMonkey are used in the Wine project&#x27;s JScript (re-)implementation

<text>Quantum indeterminacy is the apparent &quot;necessary&quot; incompleteness in the description of a physical system, that has become one of the characteristics of the standard description of quantum physics. Prior to quantum physics, it was thought that
Quantum indeterminacy can be quantitatively characterized by a probability distribution on the set of outcomes of measurements of an observable. The distribution is uniquely determined by the system state, and moreover quantum mechanics provides a recipe for calculating this probability distribution.

Indeterminacy in measurement was not an innovation of quantum mechanics, since it had been established early on by experimentalists that errors in measurement may lead to indeterminate outcomes. By the later half of the 18th century, measurement errors were well understood, and it was known that they could either be reduced by better equipment or accounted for by statistical error models. In quantum mechanics, however, indeterminacy is of a much more fundamental nature, having nothing to do with errors or disturbance.

== Measurement ==
An adequate account of quantum indeterminacy requires a theory of measurement. Many theories have been proposed since the beginning of quantum mechanics and quantum measurement continues to be an active research area in both theoretical and experimental physics. Possibly the first systematic attempt at a mathematical theory was developed by John von Neumann. The kinds of measurements he investigated are now called projective measurements. That theory was based in turn on the theory of projection-valued measures for self-adjoint operators that had been recently developed (by von Neumann and independently by Marshall Stone) and the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics (attributed by von Neumann to Paul Dirac).

In this formulation, the state of a physical system corresponds to a vector of length 1 in a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; over the complex numbers. An observable is represented by a self-adjoint (i.e. Hermitian) operator &quot;A&quot; on &quot;H&quot;. If &quot;H&quot; is finite dimensional, by the spectral theorem, &quot;A&quot; has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. If the system is in state &quot;ψ&quot;, then immediately after measurement the system will occupy a state that is an eigenvector &quot;e&quot; of &quot;A&quot; and the observed value &quot;λ&quot; will be the corresponding eigenvalue of the equation . It is immediate from this that measurement in general will be non-deterministic. Quantum mechanics, moreover, gives a recipe for computing a probability distribution Pr on the possible outcomes given the initial system state is &quot;ψ&quot;. The probability is
formula_1
where &quot;E&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) is the projection onto the space of eigenvectors of &quot;A&quot; with eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;.

=== Example ===

In this example, we consider a single spin 1/2 particle (such as an electron) in which we only consider the spin degree of freedom. The corresponding Hilbert space is the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space C2, with each quantum state corresponding to a unit vector in C2 (unique up to phase). In this case, the state space can be geometrically represented as the surface of a sphere, as shown in the figure on the right.

The Pauli spin matrices
formula_2
are self-adjoint and correspond to spin-measurements along the 3 coordinate axes.

The Pauli matrices all have the eigenvalues +1, −1.
* For &quot;σ&quot;1, these eigenvalues correspond to the eigenvectors formula_3
* For &quot;σ&quot;3, they correspond to the eigenvectors formula_4

Thus in the state
formula_5
&quot;σ&quot;1 has the determinate value +1, while measurement of &quot;σ&quot;3 can produce either +1, −1 each with probability 1/2. In fact, there is no state in which measurement of both &quot;σ&quot;1 and &quot;σ&quot;3 have determinate values.

There are various questions that can be asked about the above indeterminacy assertion.
# Can the apparent indeterminacy be construed as in fact deterministic, but dependent upon quantities not modeled in the current theory, which would therefore be incomplete? More precisely, are there &quot;hidden variables&quot; that could account for the statistical indeterminacy in a completely classical way?
# Can the indeterminacy be understood as a disturbance of the system being measured?
Von Neumann formulated the question 1) and provided an argument why the answer had to be no, &quot;if&quot; one accepted the formalism he was proposing. However, according to Bell, von Neumann&#x27;s formal proof did not justify his informal conclusion. A definitive but partial negative answer to 1) has been established by experiment: because Bell&#x27;s inequalities are violated, any such hidden variable(s) cannot be &quot;local&quot; (see Bell test experiments).

The answer to 2) depends on how disturbance is understood, particularly since measurement entails disturbance (however note that this is the observer effect, which is distinct from the uncertainty principle). Still, in the most natural interpretation the answer is also no. To see this, consider two sequences of measurements: (A) that measures exclusively &quot;σ&quot;1 and (B) that measures only &quot;σ&quot;3 of a spin system in the state &quot;ψ&quot;. The measurement outcomes of (A) are all +1, while the statistical distribution of the measurements (B) is still divided between +1, −1 with equal probability.

=== Other examples of indeterminacy ===
Quantum indeterminacy can also be illustrated in terms of a particle with a definitely measured momentum for which there must be a fundamental limit to how precisely its location can be specified. This quantum uncertainty principle can be expressed in terms of other variables, for example, a particle with a definitely measured energy has a fundamental limit to how precisely one can specify how long it will have that energy.
The magnitude involved in quantum uncertainty is on the order of the Planck constant ().

== Indeterminacy and incompleteness ==
Quantum indeterminacy is the assertion that the state of a system does not determine a unique collection of values for all its measurable properties. Indeed, according to the Kochen–Specker theorem, in the quantum mechanical formalism it is impossible that, for a given quantum state, each one of these measurable properties (observables) has a determinate (sharp) value. The values of an observable will be obtained non-deterministically in accordance with a probability distribution that is uniquely determined by the system state. Note that the state is destroyed by measurement, so when we refer to a collection of values, each measured value in this collection must be obtained using a freshly prepared state.

This indeterminacy might be regarded as a kind of essential incompleteness in our description of a physical system. Notice however, that the indeterminacy as stated above only applies to values of measurements not to the quantum state. For example, in the spin 1/2 example discussed above, the system can be prepared in the state &quot;ψ&quot; by using measurement of &quot;σ&quot;1 as a &quot;filter&quot; that retains only those particles such that &quot;σ&quot;1 yields +1. By the von Neumann (so-called) postulates, immediately after the measurement the system is assuredly in the state &quot;ψ&quot;.

However, Albert Einstein believed that quantum state cannot be a complete description of a physical system and, it is commonly thought, never came to terms with quantum mechanics. In fact, Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen showed that if quantum mechanics is correct, then the classical view of how the real world works (at least after special relativity) is no longer tenable. This view included the following two ideas:
# A measurable property of a physical system whose value can be predicted with certainty is actually an element of (local) reality (this was the terminology used by EPR).
# Effects of local actions have a finite propagation speed.
This failure of the classical view was one of the conclusions of the EPR thought experiment in which two remotely located observers, now commonly referred to as Alice and Bob, perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a spin singlet state. It was a conclusion of EPR, using the formal apparatus of quantum theory, that once Alice measured spin in the &quot;x&quot; direction, Bob&#x27;s measurement in the &quot;x&quot; direction was determined with certainty, whereas immediately before Alice&#x27;s measurement Bob&#x27;s outcome was only statistically determined. From this it follows that either value of spin in the &quot;x&quot; direction is not an element of reality or that the effect of Alice&#x27;s measurement has infinite speed of propagation.

== Indeterminacy for mixed states ==

We have described indeterminacy for a quantum system that is in a pure state. Mixed states are a more general kind of state obtained by a statistical mixture of pure states. For mixed states
the &quot;quantum recipe&quot; for determining the probability distribution of a measurement is determined as follows:

Let &quot;A&quot; be an observable of a quantum mechanical system. &quot;A&quot; is given by a densely
defined self-adjoint operator on &quot;H&quot;. The spectral measure of &quot;A&quot; is a projection-valued measure defined by the condition
: formula_6
for every Borel subset &quot;U&quot; of R. Given a mixed state &quot;S&quot;, we introduce the &quot;distribution&quot; of &quot;A&quot; under &quot;S&quot; as follows:
: formula_7

This is a probability measure defined on the Borel subsets of R that is the probability distribution obtained by measuring &quot;A&quot; in &quot;S&quot;.

== Logical independence and quantum randomness ==

Quantum indeterminacy is often understood as information (or lack of it) whose existence we infer, occurring in individual quantum systems, prior to measurement. &quot;Quantum randomness&quot; is the statistical manifestation of that indeterminacy, witnessable in results of experiments repeated many times. However, the relationship between quantum indeterminacy and randomness is subtle and can be considered differently.

In &quot;classical physics&quot;, experiments of chance, such as coin-tossing and dice-throwing, are deterministic, in the sense that, perfect knowledge of the initial conditions would render outcomes perfectly predictable. The ‘randomness’ stems from ignorance of physical information in the initial toss or throw. In diametrical contrast, in the case of &quot;quantum physics&quot;, the theorems of Kochen and Specker, the inequalities of John Bell, and experimental evidence of Alain Aspect, all indicate that quantum randomness does not stem from any such &quot;physical information&quot;.

In 2008, Tomasz Paterek et al. provided an explanation in &quot;mathematical information&quot;. They proved that quantum randomness is, exclusively, the output of measurement experiments whose input settings introduce &quot;logical independence&quot; into quantum systems.

Logical independence is a well-known phenomenon in Mathematical Logic. It refers to the null logical connectivity that exists between mathematical propositions (in the same language) that neither prove nor disprove one another.

In the work of Paterek et al., the researchers demonstrate a link connecting quantum randomness and &quot;logical independence&quot; in a formal system of Boolean propositions. In experiments measuring photon polarisation, Paterek et al. demonstrate statistics correlating predictable outcomes with logically dependent mathematical propositions, and random outcomes with propositions that are logically independent.

In 2020, Steve Faulkner reported on work following up on the findings of Tomasz Paterek et al.; showing what logical independence in the Paterek Boolean propositions means, in the domain of Matrix Mechanics proper. He showed how indeterminacy&#x27;s &quot;indefiniteness&quot; arises in evolved density operators representing mixed states, where measurement processes encounter irreversible &#x27;lost history&#x27; and ingression of ambiguity.

<text>Lana Lang is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. She is a &quot;Superman&quot; supporting character, a childhood friend and love interest of the young Clark Kent. She was created by writer Bill Finger and artist John Sikela, and first appeared in &quot;Superboy&quot; #10 (September/October 1950). The character has occasionally gained superhuman powers and assumes the superhero identities of Insect Queen and Superwoman.

Lana has appeared in other-media adaptations of &quot;Superman&quot;, typically as a teenager. These portrayals include that by Diane Sherry in &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, Annette O&#x27;Toole in its sequel &quot;Superman III&quot;, Stacy Haiduk in the television series &quot;Superboy&quot;, Kristin Kreuk in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, and Emmanuelle Chriqui in the television series &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Bill Finger and artist John Sikela, the character first appears in &quot;Superboy&quot; #10 (September/October 1950). Across decades of Superman comics and adaptations into other media, Lana has most consistently been depicted as Superman&#x27;s teenage romantic interest growing up in Smallville; as an adult, she is a friend of Superman in his civilian identity as Clark Kent.

Lana is one of many &quot;Superman&quot; characters with the alliterative initials &quot;LL&quot;, the most notable other examples being Superman&#x27;s primary love interest Lois Lane and archnemesis, Lex Luthor. In the Silver Age, she regularly appeared in comic books depicting the adventures of Superman&#x27;s teenaged self, Superboy, and also appeared as an adult in numerous Superman titles, vying with Lois Lane for his attention. In modern revisions of DC Comics continuity, she and Clark are shown to have remained friends since their teenage years. The story varies across different revisions of Superman&#x27;s origin story. For example, in &quot;&quot;, Lana becomes privy to Clark&#x27;s unusual abilities at an early age and becomes his earliest confidant outside of his parents and the futuristic Legion of Super-Heroes.

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age and Bronze Age===
====Earth-One version====

In the original Superboy stories, Lana was the girl who lived next door to the Kent family in Smallville, and was a romantic interest of Superboy. In the Silver Age stories, Lana often behaved like a younger version of Lois Lane, spending much of her time trying to prove that Superboy and Clark Kent were one and the same.

At one point, Lana once rescued an insect-like alien trapped by a fallen tree in Smallville. In gratitude, the alien gave her a &quot;bio-genetic&quot; ring which allowed Lana to gain insect (and insect-like, such as arachnids) characteristics. Lana created a yellow honeybee-like costume and mask, and took the name &quot;Insect Queen&quot;, under which identity Lana had several adventures.

Lana also had various adventures with Superboy, and several with the futuristic superhero team the Legion of Super-Heroes. Also appearing in some Silver Age stories was Lana&#x27;s uncle, Professor Potter, an eccentric inventor.

After Clark and Lana graduated from high school, Lana went to college, and eventually became a television reporter for Metropolis TV station WMET-TV. As an adult, Lana became a rival to Lois Lane for Superman&#x27;s affection in various 1960s stories, often appearing in the Lois Lane comics series &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, Lana became an anchorwoman for WGBS-TV&#x27;s evening news in Metropolis, as a co-anchor to Clark Kent. Her attraction to Superman during this time had also died off, leaving Superman to Lois Lane. Lana later became romantically linked to the alien super-hero Vartox. Eventually, she and Clark Kent became romantically involved in stories prior to the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

====Earth-Two version====
In the early 1980s, with the use of the multiverse system DC had in place, Lana Lang was also shown in several stories to have had an Earth-Two counterpart (Earth-Two at the time the home of the Justice Society of America and DC&#x27;s Golden Age versions of its characters, versus its mainstream universe of &quot;Earth-One&quot;). The Earth-Two Lana Lang was introduced in &quot;Superman Family&quot; #203. In this story, Lana Lang joins the &quot;Daily Star&quot; as a television critic. On Earth-Two Lana&#x27;s father left Smallville and moved to Metropolis as a young man, so Clark did not know Lana in his youth.

Later, she became an Insect Queen like her Earth-One counterpart; in this case, Lana had received a mystic amulet from her archaeologist father, the amulet having been created to allow a pharaoh to control and divert the locust hordes that threatened ancient Egypt. However, the sound of approaching insect wings was set to energize the charm associated with the amulet; by unfortunate coincidence, the sound of Superman&#x27;s super-speed flying was similar enough to activate the spell. Lana was thus compelled to create a chitinous golden-brown costume (woven by silkworms under her control) and adopt a villainous alter ego, the Insect Queen. After an initial clash with Superman, the Insect Queen fell under the mental influence of Superman&#x27;s enemy, the Ultra-Humanite, who kept her under the spell&#x27;s compulsion and prevented her from reverting to normal. Earth-Two&#x27;s Superman located an antidote to the spell, which Lois Lane used to remove the compulsion (&quot;Superman Family&quot; #213), letting Lana break free of Ultra&#x27;s influence and making her able to use the amulet&#x27;s power at her own discretion. The Earth-2 Insect Queen would later use her abilities to aid Superman in times of need. This version of Lana Lang was retconned out of existence after the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

===Modern Age===
After the 1985-1986 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was written, various aspects of Lana&#x27;s history were retconned, starting with comics writer John Byrne&#x27;s miniseries &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, which was designed to rewrite Superman&#x27;s origin from scratch. In the post-Crisis version of events, Lana was a childhood friend of Clark, with a certain degree of romantic tension in the air as Lana had long pined after Clark, who had loved her only platonically in return.

After they graduated from high school Clark took Lana on a private walk, saying that he had to tell her something important, which Lana honestly expected to be a marriage proposal. He then divulged to her that he had superpowers, displayed by flying her around the world, before explaining that he felt he had to leave Smallville to help humanity as a whole. Kissing her goodbye &quot;like a brother&quot;, Lana was left in considerable shock, not only over the revelation of Clark&#x27;s superpowers, but also over the final realization that he held no reciprocal romantic feelings towards her, leaving Lana heartbroken and alone. When Lana finally aired her grievance with him years later (&quot;The Man of Steel&quot; #6), Clark felt very badly over how he had hurt her.

When Clark appeared in public as Superman some years later, the lonely and depressed Lana deduced his true identity and became something of a stalker, to the extent that Lex Luthor noticed the frequency with which she appeared in the vicinity of the hero and actually had her tortured in an attempt to gain whatever inside knowledge of Superman she might have. Lana bravely kept Clark&#x27;s identity a secret and upon his rescuing her their relationship became more healthy once again, albeit still at a distance. A long-term conspiracy of the Oan-created androids, the Manhunters, from whose control Lana and the rest of Smallville&#x27;s children born around the same time as her were eventually freed, proved to be the cause of this stalking. Unlike the pre-Crisis Earth-One continuity, Lana did not go on to have a journalistic career or compete with Lois for Superman&#x27;s affections, nor play a significant role in Clark&#x27;s life in Metropolis.

Lana&#x27;s relationship with Clark is again altered in 2003&#x27;s &quot;&quot; limited series by Mark Waid, which again revises Superman&#x27;s origins. This storyline, which takes some inspiration from the TV show &quot;Smallville&quot; (such as the appearance of Ma and Pa Kent), also shows Clark and Lana to have had a mutual romantic relationship during their youth. At the start of the storyline, Lana has already left Smallville prior to Clark&#x27;s return from his world journey. Upon his arrival home, Clark is told that Lana left some time prior and no one has heard from her since. Following this storyline, there is never again any mention of her history regarding Clark or Superman.

Lana&#x27;s &quot;Birthright&quot; history has been yet again re-made following the events of the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, which has revived Clark&#x27;s pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Superboy alter-ego. In this new history, Lana&#x27;s two obnoxious brothers, whom she lacked in previous versions, often interrupted her romantic relationship with Clark. The full extent of her history and her connection to Superboy/Clark has not been fully disclosed. Again, her previous history has not been mentioned since this revision.

Years later, the post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Lana eventually married Pete Ross. The two settled into a quiet life in Smallville, where they had a son they named after their mutual friend, Clark. They picked this name for their son after Lana asked Clark to save his life when a car accident caused him to be born eight weeks premature. Although the attack of the Brainiac-controlled Doomsday interrupted Clark&#x27;s efforts to take the baby to receive care, Brainiac&#x27;s subsequent attempts to use the baby&#x27;s DNA to create a new body for himself brought the baby to full term. Pete began a career in politics that got him elected to the Senate. In 2000, Senator Ross became Lex Luthor&#x27;s vice presidential running mate in Luthor&#x27;s bid to become President, and after the two won, Lana moved to Washington, D.C. Eventually, Luthor was forced from his office, and Pete Ross became President (and Lana the First Lady). As she and Pete began to drift apart, Lana began to subtly attempt to regain Clark&#x27;s affections, much to the anger of his (now) wife Lois Lane. Pete and Lana briefly reunited after Superman saved them from a murder attempt by the villainous Ruin.

In &quot;Superman&quot; #654, Perry White reported that Lana had become CEO of Lexcorp following the ousting of founder Lex Luthor. In Superman/Batman #49, it is revealed that she sold Kryptonite to the government to prevent Lexcorp from going under and had caches of Kryptonite placed all over the planet, as a last-ditch defense if Superman should ever go rogue. When Superman and Batman come to remove the Kryptonite, Lana refuses to hand it over and pushes a button which turns the caches into &quot;dirty bombs&quot; which spread Kryptonite molecules through the entire planet, forcing all Kryptonians to vacate. However, Toyman uses special nanobots to remove all of the Kryptonite molecules, undoing the damage. Superman meets with Lana again, with Lana telling him she was left with no choice. Superman responds by telling her that, while he does sometimes wonder what things would have been like if he had married her rather than Lois, there is a reason he is with Lois instead of her: Lois would never have pushed the button. After Superman flies off, someone is shown watching Lana crying on a screen, saying to her &quot;you did perfect&quot;. In Superman/Batman #63 suggests that this was Gorilla Grodd, when Batman mentions that &quot;Grodd finally finished what he started when he controlled Lana all those years ago&quot;. However, this scenario is later revealed to be a simulation created in the Batcomputer.

She later tries to help Superman, facing the time-traveling strongman Atlas, by sending the Luthor Squad. This act activates a dormant program inside the Lexcorp mainframes, a holographic version of Luthor. The holographic copy of Luthor informs Lana that by helping Superman she has violated the Lexcorp standard contract of employment (&quot;very, very fine print&quot;), that forbids Lexcorp employees to use Lexcorp resources for helping Kryptonians, under the penalty of termination. Lana is given five minutes to leave the building, or they will shoot her to death.

In 2008, a new &quot;Supergirl&quot; writer Sterling Gates told Newsarama about Lana Lang: &quot;We&#x27;re integrating Supergirl&#x27;s book more into the Superman universe, and that includes having a supporting cast that overlaps with that world. I&#x27;m very interested in tying her back in to Metropolis and making sure that her world is a part of the Superman universe. Cat Grant will be a regular supporting cast member, as will Lana Lang&quot;.

Lana takes it upon herself to reach out to Supergirl. She offers her advice and friendship. Around the same time, Perry White has been actively pursuing Lana to take over the Business section of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, a position which Lana was afraid to accept, following her bad experience with Lexcorp. Eventually, Lana and Supergirl decide together that Lana will accept the position, and that Supergirl will take on the secret identity of Linda Lang, niece of Lana Lang. Lana now lives in Metropolis with Supergirl, and is working as the editor of the Business section of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

She briefly returns to Smallville to attend Jonathan Kent&#x27;s funeral. However, unable to muster enough resolve to patch up things with Clark, Lana leaves before giving him her condolences.

While attending a student journalism award ceremony with Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant, Lana suddenly collapses, with blood pouring out her nose.; She receives a call from her doctor telling her that he has &quot;bad news&quot; for her. After Lana has another collapse, she is taken to the hospital and brought into surgery. She apparently dies on the operating table, but black insect-like creatures later encase her body in a cocoon, which then starts to crack open. A gigantic cocoon-like structure soon engulfs the hospital, and an army of giant insects takes hostage a number of workers as well as the Science Police and the Guardian. Supergirl is soon captured and awakens bound and gagged at the feet of Lana, whom the Insect Queen now possesses. The Queen reveals to Supergirl that during her last encounter with Lana, she injected her with a portion of her DNA and has been slowly taking control of her body for the past year, with the ultimate goal of capturing a Kryptonian to use as a template for an army of hybrid insects. Supergirl breaks free and is able to expel the Queen from Lana&#x27;s body with help from Kryptonian technology, and Lana returns to her normal state. While Lana is recovering, Supergirl visits her. Supergirl tells Lana she can no longer be a part of her family because of her lies about her condition. Lana and &quot;Linda&quot; have since reconciled and are currently living in the Hammersmith tower building in Metropolis.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, DC Comics rebooted their continuity. In this new timeline, Lana is a childhood friend of Clark and has been privy to Clark&#x27;s unusual abilities from an early age. They also share mutual romantic feelings for each other during their youth, and they would have gone to the Senior Prom together if that had not been the night that Clark&#x27;s parents died. Lana eventually leaves Clark behind in Smallville to make her own mark on the world, but not before reassuring him that she will always love him. In the present day continuity, Lana works as an electrical engineer on various projects around the world. It is hinted that adult Clark still harbors romantic feelings for Lana.

In &quot;The New 52: Futures End&quot;, Lang was among the countless Earth 2 refugees who escaped Darkseid and his Parademon army&#x27;s destruction of their home world and relocated to Prime Earth. Ending up working in the Cadmus Island sub-basement under King Faraday, Lana was able to conceal her meta-human biology from everyone, except Cole Cash. Lana and Cole eventually escaped the island together but were then forced to visit the Earth Registration Authority, where it was reported that Cole Cash had died nine years prior, forcing him to re-register under the legal name &quot;Cole Lang&quot; - Lana&#x27;s husband and an Earth-2 native. Shortly afterwards, Lana adopted Susan Lang, formerly Fifty Sue, a super-powered little girl she had met on Cadmus Island.

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics started a company-wide crossover event titled Rebirth. A pre-Flashpoint Clark Kent discovered Lana under a memorial for Superman, where she revealed that she had made a promise to move Clark&#x27;s remains next to his family&#x27;s in Smallville, Kansas. The Pre-Flashpoint Clark had her take him to the Fortress of Solitude to see if he could revive Superman as he had assumed but realized that he couldn&#x27;t. He then took Lana to Smallville and helped her to re-bury Superman&#x27;s remains.

It is subsequently revealed that, apparently due to their presence at the death of the New 52 Clark Kent, Lana and Lois have acquired powers, each calling themselves &#x27;Superwoman&#x27;, with Lois demonstrating Superman&#x27;s traditional powers while Lana manifests a form similar to the more recent &#x27;Superman Red&#x27;, able to absorb and generate multiple forms of energy. Although Lana initially plans to operate in secret, after Lois is killed, she begins taking on a more active role as Superwoman. She continues to function as Superwoman but is ultimately de-powered and returns to normal life.

=== Dawn of DC ===
In the Dawn of DC series &quot;Steelworks&quot;, Lana Lang marries John Henry Irons and is exposed to zero-point energy that causes her to regain her powers. During &quot;House of Brainiac&quot;, she is captured by Brainiac before being rescued.

==Reception==
The character of Lana Lang has been analyzed as a portrayal of women in American comics. Her depiction in comics is seen in contrast to Lois Lane, in that &quot;everything that woman are thought to be that the plot does not allow Lois spills over into Lana&#x27;s character. Thus, the exaggeratedly feminine nature of Lana&#x27;s speech and appearance- her form-fitting, sometimes revealing outfits for example- stands in contrast to Lois&#x27; sportier clothes and straightforward speech.&quot;

<text>Sourdough or sourdough bread is a bread made by allowing the dough to ferment using naturally occurring lactobacillaceae and yeast before baking. The fermentation process produces lactic acid, which gives the bread a sour taste and improves its keeping-qualities.

Sourdough is one of the most ancient forms of bread, and it was the standard method of breadmaking for most of human history. It was replaced by barm during the Middle Ages, which was then replaced by industrially produced baker&#x27;s yeast in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==History==
In the &quot;Encyclopedia of Food Microbiology&quot;, Michael Gaenzle writes: &quot;One of the oldest sourdough breads dates from 3700 BCE and was excavated in Switzerland, but the origin of sourdough fermentation likely relates to the origin of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent and Egypt several thousand years earlier&quot;, and &quot;Bread production relied on the use of sourdough as a leavening agent for most of human history; the use of baker&#x27;s yeast as a leavening agent dates back less than 150 years&quot;. Sourdough remained the usual form of leavening down into the European Middle Ages until being replaced by barm from the beer brewing process, and after 1871 by purpose-cultured yeast.

Bread made from 100% rye flour, popular in northern Europe, is typically leavened with sourdough rather than baker’s yeast, as rye lacks sufficient gluten to support yeast leavening. Instead, rye bread’s structure relies on the starch in the flour and other carbohydrates known as pentosans. However, rye amylase remains active at higher temperatures than wheat amylase, which can cause the bread’s structure to weaken as the starches break down during baking. The lowered pH of a sourdough starter inactivates the amylases when heat alone cannot, allowing the carbohydrates to gel and set properly in the bread structure.

In southern Europe, sourdough remains traditional for certain breads like panettone. However, in the 20th century, sourdough became less common, replaced by the faster-acting baker’s yeast. Sometimes, this yeast is supplemented with longer fermentation periods to allow some bacterial activity, which adds flavor. During the 2010s, sourdough fermentation regained popularity as a major method in bread production, often used alongside baker’s yeast as a leavening agent.

French bakers brought sourdough techniques to Northern California during the California Gold Rush, and it remains a part of the culture of San Francisco today. (The nickname remains in &quot;Sourdough Sam&quot;, the mascot of the San Francisco 49ers.) Sourdough has long been associated with the 1849 gold prospectors, though they were more likely to make bread with commercial yeast or baking soda. The &quot;celebrated&quot; San Francisco sourdough is a white bread characterized by a pronounced sourness, and indeed the strain of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; in sourdough starters is named &quot;Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot; (previously &quot;Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot;), alongside the sourdough yeast &quot;Kasachstania humilis&quot; (previously &quot;Candida milleri&quot;) found in the same cultures.

The sourdough tradition was carried into the Department of Alaska in the United States and the Yukon Territory in Canada during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1898. Conventional leavenings such as yeast and baking soda were much less reliable in the conditions faced by the prospectors. Experienced miners and other settlers frequently carried a pouch of starter either around their neck or on a belt; these were fiercely guarded to keep from freezing. However, freezing does not kill a sourdough starter; excessive heat does. Old hands came to be called &quot;sourdoughs&quot;, a term that is still applied to any Alaskan or Klondike old-timer. The significance of the nickname&#x27;s association with Yukon culture was immortalized in the writings of Robert Service, particularly his collection of &quot;Songs of a Sourdough&quot;.

In English-speaking countries, where wheat-based breads predominate, sourdough is no longer the standard method for bread leavening. It was gradually replaced, first by the use of barm from beer making, then, after the confirmation of germ theory by Louis Pasteur, by cultured yeasts. Although sourdough bread was superseded in commercial bakeries in the 20th century, it has undergone a revival among artisan bakers and, more recently, in industrial bakeries. In countries where there is no legal definition of sourdough bread, the dough for some products named or marketed as such is leavened using baker&#x27;s yeast or chemical raising agents as well as, or instead of, a live sourdough starter culture. The Real Bread Campaign calls these products sourfaux.

Manufacturers of non-sourdough breads make up for the lack of yeast and bacterial culture by introducing into their dough an artificially made mix known as bread improver or flour improver.

== Modern culture ==

Sourdough baking has a devoted community today. Many devotees share starters and tips via the Internet. Hobbyists often share their work on social media. Sourdough cultures contain communities of living organisms, with a history unique to each individual starter, and bakers can feel an obligation to maintain them. The different yeasts present in the air in any region also enter sourdough, causing starters to change depending on location.

Some devotees find interest in history. Sourdough expert Ed Wood isolated millennia-old yeast from an ancient Egyptian bakery near the pyramids of Giza, and many individual starters, such as Carl Griffith&#x27;s 1847 starter, have been passed down through generations. &quot;I like the throwback of traditional bread, the things our great grandmothers ate,&quot; writes professional baker Stacie Kearney. Some bakers describe starters generations old, though Griffith&#x27;s seems exceptional.
Sourdough baking became more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, as increased interest in home baking caused shortages of baker&#x27;s yeast in stores, whereas sourdough can be propagated at home. 

Sourdough baking requires minimal equipment and simple ingredients – flour, salt, and water – but invites practice. Purism is a part of the appeal. As described by one enthusiast, &quot;If you take flour, water, (wild) yeast and salt, and play around with time and temperature, what comes out of the oven is something utterly transformed.&quot; Many bakers feed their starters on elaborate schedules, and many name them. Some approach sourdough as science, attempting to optimize flavor and acidity with careful measurements, experimentation, and correspondence with professional microbiologists. Some lineages of starter are freely shared, and others can be purchased, but many prefer to cultivate their own. Some techniques for doing so are fiercely debated, such as the use of commercial yeast to jump-start a culture while capturing wild yeasts, or adding grapes or milk.

==Preparation==
===Starter===
The preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment (the &quot;starter&quot; or &quot;leaven&quot;, also known as the &quot;chief&quot;, &quot;chef&quot;, &quot;head&quot;, &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;sponge&quot;), a fermented mixture of flour and water, containing a colony of microorganisms including wild yeast and lactobacilli. The purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters, as the ratio of water to flour in the starter (&quot;hydration&quot;) varies. A starter may be a liquid batter or a stiff dough.

Flour naturally contains a variety of yeasts and bacteria. When wheat flour comes into contact with water, the naturally occurring enzyme amylase breaks down the starch into the sugars glucose and maltose, which sourdough&#x27;s natural yeast can metabolize. With sufficient time, temperature, and refreshments with new or fresh dough, the mixture develops a stable culture. This culture will cause a dough to rise. The bacteria ferment starches that the yeast cannot metabolise, and the by-products, chiefly maltose, are metabolised by the yeast, which produces carbon dioxide gas, leavening the dough.

Obtaining a satisfactory rise from sourdough takes longer than a dough leavened with baker&#x27;s yeast because the yeast in a sourdough is less vigorous. In the presence of lactic acid bacteria, however, some sourdough yeasts have been observed to produce twice the gas of baker&#x27;s yeast. The acidic conditions in sourdough, along with the bacteria also producing enzymes that break down proteins, result in weaker gluten and may produce a denser finished product.

===Refreshment/feeding of the starter===

As it ferments, sometimes for several days, the volume of the starter is increased by periodic additions of flour and water, called &quot;refreshments&quot; or referred to as a &quot;feeding&quot;. As long as this starter culture is fed flour and water regularly, it will remain active.

The ratio of fermented starter to fresh flour and water is critical in the development and maintenance of a starter. This ratio is called the &quot;refreshment ratio&quot;. Higher refreshment ratios are associated with greater microbial stability in the sourdough. In San Francisco sourdough, the ratio is 40% of the total weight, which is roughly equivalent to 67% of the new-dough&#x27;s weight. A high refreshment ratio keeps acidity of the refreshed dough relatively low. Acidity levels of below pH 4.0 inhibit lactobacilli and favor acid-tolerant yeasts.

A starter prepared from scratch with a salted wheat-rye dough takes about 54 hours at to stabilise at a pH between 4.4 and 4.6. 4% salt inhibits &quot;L. sanfranciscensis&quot;, while &quot;C. milleri&quot; can withstand 8%.

A drier and cooler starter has less bacterial activity and more yeast growth, which results in the bacterial production of more acetic acid relative to lactic acid. Conversely, a wetter and warmer starter has more bacterial activity and less yeast growth, with more lactic acid relative to acetic acid. The yeasts produce mainly CO2 and ethanol. High amounts of lactic acid are desired in rye and mixed-rye fermentations, while relatively higher amounts of acetic acid are desired in wheat fermentations. A dry, cool starter produces a sourer loaf than a wet, warm one. Firm starters (such as the Flemish Desem starter, which may be buried in a large container of flour to prevent drying out) tend to be more resource-intensive than wet ones.

===Intervals between refreshments===
A stable culture in which &quot;F. sanfranciscensis&quot; is the dominant bacterium requires a temperature between and refreshments every 24 hours for about two weeks. Refreshment intervals of longer than three days acidify the dough and may change the microbial ecosystem.

The intervals between refreshments of the starter may be reduced in order to increase the rate of gas (CO2) production, a process described as &quot;acceleration.&quot; In this process, the ratio of yeasts to lactobacilli may be altered. Generally, if once-daily refreshment-intervals have not been reduced to several hours, the percentage amount of starter in the final dough should be reduced to obtain a satisfactory rise during proof.

Faster starter processes, requiring fewer refreshments, have been devised, sometimes using commercial sourdough starters as inoculants. These starters generally fall into two types. One is made from traditionally maintained and stable starter doughs, often dried, in which the ratios of microorganisms are uncertain. Another is made from microorganisms carefully isolated from Petri dishes, grown into large, homogeneous populations in fermentors, and processed into combined baker&#x27;s products with numerically defined ratios and known quantities of microorganisms well suited to particular bread styles.

Maintaining metabolically active sourdough with high leavening activity typically requires several refreshments per day, which is achieved in bakeries that use sourdough as sole leavening agents but not by amateur bakers that use the sourdough only weekly or even less frequently.

=== Local methods ===
Bakers have devised several ways of encouraging a stable culture of micro-organisms in the starter. Unbleached, unbromated flour contains more micro-organisms than more processed flours. Bran-containing (wholemeal) flour provides the greatest variety of organisms and additional minerals, though some cultures use an initial mixture of white flour and rye or whole wheat flour or &quot;seed&quot; the culture using unwashed organic grapes (for the wild yeasts on their skins). Grapes and grape must are also sources of lactic acid bacteria, as are many other edible plants. Basil leaves are soaked in room-temperature water for an hour to seed traditional Greek sourdough. Using water from boiled potatoes is said to increase the activity of the bacteria by providing additional starch.

The piped drinking water supplied in most urban areas is treated by chlorination or chloramination, adding small amounts of substances that inhibit potentially dangerous micro-organisms but are harmless to animals. Some bakers recommend unchlorinated water for feeding cultures. Because a sourdough fermentation relies on microorganisms, using water without these agents may produce better results. Bottled drinking water is suitable; chlorine, but not chloramines, can be removed from tap water by boiling it for a time, or simply by leaving it uncovered for at least 24 hours. Chlorine and chloramines can both be removed by activated carbon filters.

Adding a small quantity of malt provides maltase and simple sugars to support the yeasts initially.

Bakers often make loaves with fermented dough from a previous batch (which they call &quot;mother dough&quot;, &quot;mother sponge&quot;, &quot;chef&quot;, or &quot;seed sour&quot;) rather than making a new starter every time they bake. The original starter culture may be many years old. Because of their pH level and the presence of antibacterial agents, such cultures are stable and able to prevent colonization by unwanted yeasts and bacteria. For this reason, sourdough products inherently keep fresh for a longer time than other breads, and are good at resisting spoilage and mold without the additives required to retard spoiling of other types of bread.

The flavour of sourdough bread varies from place to place according to the method used, the hydration of the starter and the final dough, the refreshment ratio, the length of the fermentation periods, ambient temperature, humidity, and elevation, all of which contribute to the microbiology of the sourdough.

===Baking===
The starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough, by mixing flour and water to the starter. This creates an active leaven, which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is bubbly and floats in water. The leaven is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency. The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the total flour weight, though formulas may vary. Using a smaller ratio of cold un-feed starter in the range of 5% to 10% can also create good sourdough loaves, however, the fermentation time will be longer and can result in improved flavor. The dough is shaped into loaves, left to rise, and then baked. A number of &#x27;no knead&#x27; methods are available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time sourdough bread takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking. This process is known as &#x27;retardation&#x27; to slow down the proofing process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread.

Because the rise time of most sourdough starters is longer than that of breads made with baker&#x27;s yeasts, sourdough starters are generally unsuitable for use in a bread machine. However, sourdough that has been proofed over many hours, using a sourdough starter or mother dough, can then be transferred to the machine, utilizing only the baking segment of the bread-making program, bypassing timed mechanical kneading by the machine&#x27;s paddle. This may be convenient for single loaf production, but the complex blistered and slashed crust characteristics of oven-baked sourdough bread cannot be achieved in a bread making machine, as this usually requires the use of a baking stone in the oven and misting of the dough to produce steam. Furthermore, ideal crust development requires loaves of shapes not achievable in a machine&#x27;s loaf tin.

==Biology and chemistry==


Sourdough is a stable culture of lactic acid bacteria and yeast in a mixture of flour and water. Broadly speaking, the yeast produces gas (carbon dioxide) which leavens the dough, and the lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, which contributes flavor in the form of sourness. The lactic acid bacteria metabolize sugars that the yeast cannot, while the yeast metabolizes the by-products of lactic acid fermentation. During sourdough fermentation, many cereal enzymes, particularly phytases, proteases and pentosanases, are activated through acidification and contribute to biochemical changes during sourdough fermentation.

===Lactic acid bacteria===
Every starter consists of different lactic acid bacteria which are introduced to the starter through the environment, water, and flour used to create the starter. The lactic acid bacteria are a group of gram-positive bacteria capable of converting carbohydrate substrates into organic acids and producing a wide range of metabolites. Organic acids, including propionic, formic, acetic acid, and lactic acid, create an unfavorable environment for the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.

Lactic acid bacteria commonly found in sourdough include &quot;Leuconostoc&quot;, &quot;Pediococcus&quot;, &quot;Weissella&quot; and other genera. But by far, the most prevalent species belong to the very large and diverse genus, &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;.

Lactic acid bacteria are a group comprising aerotolerant anaerobes, meaning anaerobes that can multiply in the presence of oxygen, and microaerophiles, meaning microbes that multiply at levels of oxygen lower than atmospheric.

Major lactic acid bacteria in sourdough are heterofermentative (producing more than one product) organisms and convert hexoses by the phosphoketolase pathway to lactate, CO2 and acetate or ethanol; heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria are usually associated with homofermentative (producing mainly one product) lactobacilli, particularly &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Companilactobacillus&quot; species.

===Yeasts===
The most common yeast species in sourdough are &quot;Kazachstania exigua&quot; (&quot;Saccharomyces exiguus&quot;), &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, &quot;K. exiguus&quot; and &quot;K. humilis&quot; (previously &quot;Candida milleri&quot; or &quot;Candida humilis&quot;).

===Type I sourdough===

Traditional sourdoughs used as sole leavening agent are referred to as Type I sourdough; examples include sourdoughs used for San Francisco Sourdough Bread, Panettone, and rye bread. Type I sourdoughs are generally firm doughs, have a pH range of 3.8 to 4.5, and are fermented in a temperature range of . &quot;Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot; was named for its discovery in San Francisco sourdough starters, though it is not endemic to San Francisco. &quot;F. sanfranciscensis&quot; and &quot;Limosilactobacillus pontis&quot; often highlight a lactic-acid bacterial flora that includes &quot;Limosilactobacillus fermentum&quot;, &quot;Fructilactobacillus fructivorans&quot;, &quot;Levilactobacillus brevis&quot;, and &quot;Companilactobacillus paralimentarius&quot;. The yeasts &quot;Saccharomyces exiguus&quot;, &quot;Kasachstania humilis&quot;, or &quot;Candida holmii&quot; usually populate sourdough cultures symbiotically with &quot;Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot;. The yeast &quot;S. exiguus&quot; is related to the yeasts &quot;C. milleri&quot; and &quot;C. holmii&quot;. &quot;Torulopsis holmii&quot;, &quot;Torula holmii&quot;, and &quot;S. rosei&quot; are synonyms used prior to 1978. &quot;C. milleri&quot; and &quot;C. holmii&quot; are physiologically similar, but DNA testing established them as distinct. Other yeasts reported found include &quot;C. humilis&quot;, &quot;C. krusei&quot;, &quot;Pichia anomaola&quot;, &quot;C. peliculosa&quot;, &quot;P. membranifaciens&quot;, and &quot;C. valida&quot;. There have been changes in the taxonomy of yeasts in recent decades. &quot;F. sanfranciscensis&quot; requires maltose, while &quot;C. milleri&quot; is maltase negative and thus cannot consume maltose. &quot;C. milleri&quot; can grow under conditions of low pH and relatively high acetate levels, a factor contributing to sourdough flora&#x27;s stability.

In order to produce acetic acid, &quot;F. sanfrancisensis&quot; needs maltose and fructose. Wheat dough contains abundant starch and some polyfructosanes, which enzymes degrade to &quot;maltose, fructose and little glucose.&quot; The terms &quot;fructosan, glucofructan, sucrosyl fructan, polyfructan, and polyfructosan&quot; are all used to describe a class of compounds that are &quot;structurally and metabolically&quot; related to sucrose, where &quot;carbon is stored as sucrose and polymers of fructose (fructans).&quot; Yeasts have the ability to free fructose from glucofructans which compose about 1–2% of the dough. Glucofructans are long strings of fructose molecules attached to a single glucose molecule. Sucrose can be considered the shortest glucofructan, with only a single fructose molecule attached. When &quot;L. sanfrancisensis&quot; reduces all available fructose, it stops producing acetic acid and begins producing ethanol. If the fermenting dough gets too warm, the yeasts slow down, producing less fructose. Fructose depletion is more of a concern in doughs with lower enzymatic activities.

A Belgian study of wheat and spelt doughs refreshed once every 24 hours and fermented at in a laboratory environment provides insight into the three-phase evolution of first-generation-to-stable sourdough ecosystems. In the first two days of refreshment, atypical genera &quot;Enterococcus&quot; and &quot;Lactococcus&quot; bacteria highlighted the doughs. During days 2–5, sourdough-specific bacteria belonging to the genera &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, &quot;Pediococcus&quot;, and &quot;Weissella&quot; outcompete earlier strains. Yeasts grew more slowly and reached population peaks near days 4–5. By days 5–7, &quot;well-adapted&quot; &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; strains such as &quot;L. fermentum&quot; and &quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; had emerged. At their peaks, yeast populations were in the range of about 1–10% of the lactobacilli populations or 1:10–1:100. One characteristic of a stable dough is that the heterofermentative have outcompeted homofermentative lactobacilli. &quot;F. sanfranciscensis&quot; has typically not been identified in spontaneous sourdoughs, even after multiple cycles of back-slopping; it was rapidly introduced in wheat sourdoughs, however, when plant materials were used to start the fermentation.

Investigations of wheat sourdough found that &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; died off after two refreshment cycles. &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; has less tolerance to acetic acid than other sourdough yeasts. Continuously maintained, stable sourdough cannot be unintentionally contaminated by &quot;S. cerevisiae.&quot;

===Type II sourdough===
In Type II sourdoughs, baker&#x27;s yeast or &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; is added to leaven the dough; &quot;L. pontis&quot; and &quot;Limosilactobacillus panis&quot; in association with &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species are dominant members of type II sourdoughs. They have a pH less than 3.5, and are fermented within a temperature range of for several days without feedings, which reduces the flora&#x27;s activity. This process was adopted by some in industry, in part, due to simplification of the multiple-step build typical of Type I sourdoughs.

In Type II sourdoughs, yeast growth is slowed or stopped due to higher fermentation temperatures. These doughs are more liquid and once fermented may be chilled and stored for up to a week. They are pumpable and used in continuous bread production systems.

===Type III sourdough===
Type III sourdoughs are Type II sourdoughs subjected to a drying process, usually either spray or drum drying, and are mainly used at an industrial level as flavoring agents. They are dominated by &quot;drying-resistant [lactic acid bacteria] such as &quot;Pediococcus pentosaceus&quot;, &quot;L. plantarum&quot;, and &quot;L. brevis&quot;.&quot; The drying conditions, time and heat applied, may be varied in order to influence caramelization and produce desired characteristics in the baked product.

==Types of bread==
There are many breads that use techniques similar to that used in the making of sourdough bread. Danish rugbrød (&quot;rye bread&quot;) is a dense, dark bread best known from its use in the Danish smørrebrød (open-faced sandwiches). The Mexican &quot;birote salado&quot; started out in the city of Guadalajara as a short French baguette that replaces the yeast with a sourdough fermentation process, yielding a bread that is crunchy outside but soft and savory inside. Amish friendship bread uses a sourdough starter that includes sugar and milk. It is also leavened with baking powder and baking soda. An Amish sourdough is fed with sugar and potato flakes every 3–5 days. German pumpernickel is traditionally made from a sourdough starter, although modern pumpernickel loaves often use commercial yeasts, sometimes spiked with citric acid or lactic acid to inactivate the amylases in the rye flour. Flemish desem bread (the word means &#x27;starter&#x27;) is a whole-wheat sourdough. Whole-wheat sourdough flatbreads are traditionally eaten in Azerbaijan. In Ethiopia, teff flour is fermented to make injera. A similar variant is eaten in Somalia, Djibouti, and Yemen (where it is known as lahoh). In India, idlis and dosa are made from a sourdough fermentation of rice and black gram.

==Possible fermentation effects==

Sourdough bread has a relatively low glycemic index compared with other types of bread. The activity of cereal enzymes during sourdough fermentation hydrolyses phytates, which improves the absorption of some dietary minerals and vitamins, most of which are found in the bran.

Sourdough fermentation reduces wheat components that may contribute to non-celiac wheat sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome. Sourdough fermentation and lactic acid bacteria may be useful to improve the quality of gluten-free breads, such as by enhancing texture, aroma, and shelf life.

A review of the health effects of sourdough published in 2023 concluded that: &quot;...although a broad range of sourdough related health benefits are praised in publications, social media and by bakers, a sound evidence base for measurable effects on health related clinical endpoints has not been established&quot;.

<doc id="189347" wikidata="Q368645" url="?curid=189347" title="Richard Long (artist)">
<text>Sir Richard Julian Long, (born 2 June 1945) is an English sculptor and one of the best-known British land artists.

Long is the only artist to have been short-listed four times for the Turner Prize. He was nominated in 1984, 1987 and 1988, and then won the award in 1989 for &quot;White Water Line&quot;. He lives and works in Bristol, the city in which he was born.

Long studied at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art before going on to create work using various media including sculpture, photography and text. His work is on permanent display in Britain at the Tate and Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery as well as galleries in America, Switzerland and Australia.

Long&#x27;s work has broadened the idea of sculpture to be a part of performance art and conceptual art. His work typically is made of earth, rock, mud, stone and other nature based materials. In exhibitions his work is typically displayed with the materials or through documentary photographs of his performances and experiences.

==Early life and education==

Long was born in Bristol, in south-west England. Between 1962 and 1965 he studied at the West of England College of Art, and then, from 1966 to 1968, at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in London, where he studied under Anthony Caro and Phillip King and became closely associated with fellow student Hamish Fulton.

==Work==
Several of his works were based around walks that he has made, and as well as land based natural sculpture, he uses the mediums of photography, text and maps of the landscape he has walked over. Long has been taking these walks since the mid 1960s where he has walked in places such as the Sahara Desert, Australia, Iceland and near his home in Bristol, United Kingdom. His work has proven to be revolutionary as it has changed how society views sculpture. His work has influenced the boundaries of sculpture to not be limited to only &quot;traditional&quot; materials and to be able to use alternative materials in his work. Not only is he using alternative materials such as rock and earth, but he also changed what art is, as the actual art piece can be the process of creating the art itself.

In his work, often cited as a response to the environments he walked in, the landscape would be deliberately changed in some way, as in &quot;A Line Made by Walking&quot; (1967), and sometimes sculptures were made in the landscape from rocks or similar found materials and then photographed. Other pieces consist of photographs or maps of unaltered landscapes accompanied by texts detailing the location and time of the walk it indicates.

His piece &quot;Delabole Slate Circle&quot;, acquired from the Tate Modern in 1997, is a central piece in Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. The piece is nearly 2 metres in diameter and is composed of 168 pieces of slate that came from the Delabole quarry in Cornwall, United Kingdom. The piece can be configured differently, however Long has specified a few rules on how it should be put together. All pieces of stone must touch so that they can be locked together and stable, as well as the pieces must form a circle. The connection of the slates and the geometric shape illustrates a common theme that Long portrays in his work about the relationship between man and nature. Long explains, &quot;you could say that my work is ... a balance between the patterns of nature and formalism of human, abstract ideas of lines and circles. It is where my human characteristics meet the natural forces and patterns of the world, and that is really the kind of subject of my work.&quot;


At Houghton Hall in Norfolk, the Marquess of Cholmondeley commissioned a sculpture to the east of the house. Long&#x27;s land art there consists of a circle of Cornish slate at the end of a path mown through the grass.

Permanent installations include &quot;Riverlines&quot; (2006) at the Hearst Tower in New York, US (at about 35 x 50 feet (11 x 15 metres) this was at the time the biggest wall work he had ever made); &quot;Planet Circle&quot; (1991) at the Museum de Pont, Tilburg, Netherlands; and &quot;White Water Falls&quot; (2012) in the Garvan Institute in Sydney, Australia.

In 2009, a retrospective of Long&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Heaven and Earth,&quot; appeared at the Tate Britain. In 2015, a major solo exhibition Richard Long: Time and Space, at the Arnolfini, celebrated his work in his hometown of Bristol.

==Walked-line pieces==
Long has created several pieces which hearken back to the original 1967 piece &quot;A Line Made by Walking&quot;. Some are circles or organic paths. Some exist in snow, dust, and even charred grass.

==Art market==
Long&#x27;s &quot;Whitechapel Slate Circle&quot; (1981) brought a record price for the artist in 1989 when it sold for $209,000 at Sotheby&#x27;s in New York. At another auction in 1992, the piece was estimated far more modestly at $120,000 to $160,000, but bidding never exceeded $110,000; instead, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. purchased it in 1994 through dealer Anthony d&#x27;Offay.

<doc id="189351" wikidata="Q43473" url="?curid=189351" title="Angkor Wat">
<text>Angkor Wat (; , &quot;City/Capital of Temples&quot;) is a Hindu-Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia. Located on a site measuring within the ancient Khmer capital city of Angkor, it was originally constructed in 1150 CE as a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Vishnu. It was later gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards the end of the century.

Angkor Wat was built at the behest of the Khmer king Suryavarman II in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura (present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire, as his state temple and eventual mausoleum. Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the devas in Hindu mythology and is surrounded by a moat more than . Enclosed within an outer wall long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west with scholars divided as to the significance of this. 

The temple complex fell into disuse before being restored in the 20th century with various international agencies involved in the project. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs and devatas adorning its walls. The Angkor area was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1992. Considered by some experts to be the largest religious structure in the world, it is regarded as one of the best examples of Khmer architecture and a symbol of Cambodia, depicted as a part of the Cambodian national flag. The Angkor Wat is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than 2.5 million visitors every year.

== Etymology==
The modern name &quot;Angkor Wat&quot;, means &quot;Temple City&quot; or &quot;City of Temples&quot; in Khmer language. &quot;Angkor&quot; ( ), meaning &quot;city&quot; or &quot;capital city&quot;, is a vernacular form of the word &quot;nokor&quot; ( ), which comes from the Sanskrit/Pali word &quot;nagara&quot; (Devanāgarī: नगर). &quot;Wat&quot; ( ) is the word for &quot;temple grounds&quot;, also derived from Sanskrit/Pali &quot;vāṭa&quot; (Devanāgarī: वाट), meaning &quot;enclosure&quot;. The original name of the temple was &quot;Vrah Viṣṇuloka&quot; or &quot;Parama Viṣṇuloka&quot; meaning &quot;the sacred dwelling of Vishnu&quot;. The term might also mean &quot;The king who has gone to the supreme world of Vishnu&quot;, referring to Suryavarman II posthumously and intended to venerate his glory and memory.

== History==
=== Construction===

Angkor Wat was commissioned by the Khmer king Suryavarman II (ruled 1113–) in the early 12th century in Yaśodharapura (present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer Empire. The construction of the temple commenced in 1122 CE and was completed in 1150 CE. The temple complex was constructed on the suggestion of Divākarapaṇḍita (1040–). The temple was dedicated to Hindu god Vishnu and the original religious motifs were derived from Hinduism. It was built as the king&#x27;s state temple in the capital city. While there are no foundation stela or any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple&#x27;s name that have been found, its original name is unknown and it may have been known as &quot;Vrah Viṣṇuloka&quot; after the presiding deity. The work on the temple ceased after the king&#x27;s death, leaving some of the bas-relief decoration unfinished. 

=== Buddhist temple===
In 1177, approximately 27 years after the death of Suryavarman II, Angkor was sacked by the Chams, the traditional enemies of the Khmer. Thereafter, the Khmer empire was restored by Jayavarman VII, who established a new capital at Angkor Thom and the Bayon as the state temple, situated to the north. The temple was dedicated to Buddhism as the king&#x27;s wife Indratevi was a devout Mahayana Buddhist who encouraged him to convert. Angkor Wat was therefore also gradually converted into a Buddhist site with many Hindu sculptures replaced by Buddhist art.

After the transformation from a Hindu centre of worship to Buddhism towards the end of the 12th century, Angkor Wat continues to be a Buddhist center till the present day. Historical records show that Chinese envoy Zhou Daguan and traveller Zheng He visited the Angkor Wat in the 13-14th centuries. Zheng He studied the temple architecture which was later incorporated in the Dabaoen Temple and Galazed Pagoda. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the 16th century, it was never completely abandoned. Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century, discovered in the Angkor area, state that Japanese Buddhist pilgrims had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. The inscription also tells of Ukondayu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year at Angkor Wat in 1632.

=== European rediscovery ===
In the 16th century, Portuguese traders and missionaries discovered a vast stone city hidden in the northern Cambodian forests, abandoned for over 150 years. This city contained temples, including Angkor Wat—the largest religious monument—which dominated the site. One of the first recorded visitors was António da Madalena, a Capuchin friar who explored the ruins in 1586. Three years later, he relayed his observations to Diogo do Couto, the official historian of the Portuguese Indies. Do Couto documented the friar’s account in his historical writings as follows:

In 1860, the temple was effectively rediscovered by French naturalist and explorer Henri Mouhot with the help of French missionary Father Charles-Émile Bouillevaux. Mouhot popularised the site in the West through the publication of travel notes, in which he wrote:

Mouhot&#x27;s work was published posthumously in 1864 through the Royal Geographical Society with descriptions of Angkor under the title &quot;Travels in the Central Parts of Indo-China, Siam, Cambodia and Laos&quot;. In 1861, German anthropologist Adolf Bastian undertook a four-year trip to Southeast Asia and his account of this trip titled &quot;The People of East Asia,&quot; ran to six volumes and was published in 1868. The books detailed the Angkor monuments but lacked drawings of the Angkorian sites.

France adopted Cambodia as a protectorate on 11 August 1863 partly due to the artistic legacy of Angkor Wat and other Khmer monuments in the Angkor region and invaded Siam. This quickly led to Cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country including Siem Reap, Battambang, and Sisophon which were under Siamese rule from 1795 to 1907. Following excavations at the site, there were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement such as cooking utensils, weapons, or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites.

=== Restoration and challenges ===
In the 20th century, a considerable effort was launched to clear the plant overgrowth and restore the temple complex. Conservation d&#x27;Angkor (Angkor Conservancy) was established by the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient (EFEO) in 1908. The Conservation d&#x27;Angkor was responsible for the research, conservation, and restoration activities carried out at Angkor until the early 1970s with major restoration works undertaken in the 1960s. Cambodia gained independence from France on 9 November 1953 and has controlled Angkor Wat since then. 

Restoration work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War when the Khmer Rouge took control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s. Work on Angkor was abandoned during the Khmer Rouge era and the Conservation d&#x27;Angkor was disbanded in 1975. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces caused a few bullet holes in bas reliefs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, far more damage was done to the reliefs by art thieves working out of Thailand who lopped off many sculptures and other structures, including earlier reconstructions. As with most other ancient temples in Cambodia, Angkor Wat also faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth, fungi, ground movements, war damage, and theft, though the war damage to Angkor Wat&#x27;s temples was limited compared to the rest of Cambodia&#x27;s temple ruins.

Between 1986 and 1992, the Archaeological Survey of India carried out restoration work on the temple as France did not recognise the Cambodian government at the time. Criticisms have been raised about both the early French restoration attempts and the later Indian work, with concerns over the damage done to the stone surface by the use of various chemicals and cement.

In 1992, the site was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Simultaneously, Angkor Wat was listed in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage in Danger (later removed in 2004) following an appeal for help by Norodom Sihanouk together with an appeal by UNESCO to the international community to save Angkor. Zoning of the area was designated to protect the Angkor site in 1994, Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap (APSARA) was established in 1995 to protect and manage the area, and a law to protect Cambodian heritage was passed in 1996.

In the 21st century, teams from several countries including France, India, Japan and China are involved in Angkor Wat conservation projects. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) was launched to protect the devatas, and other bas-reliefs that decorate the temple from further damage when the organization&#x27;s survey found that around 20% of the reliefs were in very poor condition mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone, but also in part also due to earlier restoration efforts. Microbial biofilms degraded sandstone at Angkor Wat. Other work involved the repair of collapsed sections of the structure and prevention of further collapse. For example, the west facade of the upper level was buttressed by scaffolding in 2002. A Japanese team completed the restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005. Replicas have been made to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures.

In December 2015, it was announced that a research team from the University of Sydney found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers that were built and demolished during the construction of Angkor Wat, as well as a massive structure, with wooden fortifications, of unknown purpose on its south side. The findings included evidence of low-density residential occupation, a road grid, ponds and mounds in the region. These discoveries indicated that the temple precinct, bounded by a moat and wall, may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite, as was previously thought.

== Architecture ==
Angkor Wat is a Hindu-Buddhist temple complex. Located on a site measuring within the ancient Khmer capital city of Angkor, it is considered as the largest religious structure in the world by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. 

=== Site and plan ===

Angkor Wat is a unique combination of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire&#x27;s state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries, most of which were originally derived from religious beliefs of Hinduism. The construction of Angkor Wat suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple. This is observed in the temple&#x27;s east–west orientation, and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the solstice at sunrise. The Angkor Wat temple&#x27;s main tower aligns with the morning sun of the spring equinox. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, the home of the gods according to Hindu mythology: the central quincunx of towers symbolise the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.

Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led scholars including Maurice Glaize and George Coedès to hypothesize that Suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple. Further evidence for this view is provided by the bas-reliefs, which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction—&quot;prasavya&quot; in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic funeral services. Archaeologist Charles Higham also describes a container that may have been a funerary jar that was recovered from the central tower. It has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse. Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of Angkor depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat&#x27;s alignment was due to its dedication to Vishnu, who was associated with the west.

Drawing on the temple&#x27;s alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, researcher Eleanor Mannikka argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under King Suryavarman II: &quot;as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king&#x27;s power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above.&quot; Mannikka&#x27;s suggestions have been received with a mixture of interest and scepticism in academic circles. She distances herself from the speculations of others, such as Graham Hancock, that Angkor Wat is part of a representation of the constellation Draco. The oldest surviving plan of Angkor Wat dates to 1715 and is credited to Fujiwara Tadayoshi. The plan is stored in the Suifu Meitoku-kai Shokokan Museum in Mito, Japan.

=== Style ===
Angkor Wat is the prime example of the classical style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. Architecturally, the elements characteristic of the style include the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, pediments, extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more static and less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.

The temple has drawn praise for the harmony of its design. According to Maurice Glaize, the temple &quot;attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions. It is a work of power, unity, and style.&quot; Architect Jacques Dumarçay believes the layout of Angkor Wat borrows Chinese influence in its system of galleries which join at right angles to form courtyards. However, the axial pattern embedded in the plan of Angkor Wat may be derived from Southeast Asian cosmology in combination with the mandala represented by the main temple.

=== Features ===
==== Outer enclosure ====
The temple complex is surrounded by an outer wall, by and high. It is encircled by a apron of open ground and a moat wide and over in perimeter. The moat extends from east to west and from north to south. Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge. There are gopuras at each of the cardinal points with the western one being the largest and consisting of three partially ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper.

Under the southern tower is a statue known as &quot;Ta Reach&quot;, originally an eight-armed statue of Vishnu that may have occupied the temple&#x27;s central shrine. Galleries run between the towers and two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as &quot;elephant gates&quot;, as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with lotus rosettes. The west face of the wall is decorated with dancing figures and the east face of the wall consists of windows with balusters, decorated with dancing figures, animals and devatas.

The outer wall encloses a space of , which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by people from the city and the royal palace to the north of the temple. Similar to other secular buildings of Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so nothing remains of them except the outline of some of the streets with most of the area now covered by vegetation. A causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with naga shaped balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the outside on either side. Each side also features a library with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.

==== Central structure ====
The temple stands on a raised terrace within the walled enclosure. It is made of three rectangular galleries rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. The two inner galleries each have four large towers at their ordinal corners (that is, North-west, North-east, South-east, and South-west) surrounding a higher fifth tower. This pattern is sometimes called a quincunx and is believed to represent the mountains of Meru. Because the temple faces west, the features are set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason, the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.

Mannikka interprets the galleries as being dedicated to the king, Brahma, the moon, and Vishnu. Each gallery has a gopura with the outer gallery measuring by , with pavilions at the corners. The gallery is open to the outside of the temple, with columned half-galleries extending and buttressing the structure. Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called &quot;Preah Poan&quot; (meaning &quot;The Thousand Buddhas&quot; gallery). Buddha images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions relating to the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in Khmer but others in Burmese and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water. North and south of the cloister are libraries.

Beyond, the second and inner galleries are connected to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace, again a later addition. From the second level upwards, devata images are abound on the walls, singly or in groups of up to four. The second-level enclosure is by , and may originally have been flooded to represent the ocean around Mount Meru. Three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery. The steep stairways may represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods. This inner gallery, called the &quot;Bakan&quot;, is a square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers.

The roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or garudas. Carved lintels and pediments decorate the entrances to the galleries and the shrines. The tower above the central shrine rises to a height of above the ground; unlike those of previous temple mountains, the central tower is raised above the surrounding four. The shrine itself, originally occupied by a statue of Vishnu and open on each side, was walled in when the temple was converted to Theravada Buddhism, the new walls featuring standing Buddhas. In 1934, the conservator George Trouvé excavated the pit beneath the central shrine: filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure, but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of gold leaf two metres above ground level.

==== Decoration ====

Integrated with the architecture of the building, one of the causes for its fame is Angkor Wat&#x27;s extensive decoration, which predominantly takes the form of bas-relief friezes. The inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large-scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Higham has called these &quot;the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving&quot;. From the north-west corner anti-clockwise, the western gallery shows the Battle of Lanka from the Ramayana, in which Rama defeats Ravana; and the Kurukshetra War from the Mahabharata, depicting the mutual annihilation of the Kaurava and Pandava armies. On the southern gallery, the only historical scene, a procession of Suryavarman II is depicted along with the 32 hells and 37 heavens of Hinduism.

On the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the Churning of the Sea of Milk, showing 92 asuras and 88 devas using the serpent Vasuki to churn the sea of milk under Vishnu&#x27;s direction. Mannikka counts only 91 asuras and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the winter solstice to the spring equinox, and from the equinox to the summer solstice. It is followed by reliefs showing Vishnu defeating asuras, which was a 16th-century addition. The northern gallery shows Krishna&#x27;s victory over Bana.

Angkor Wat is decorated with depictions of apsaras and devatas with more than 1,796 documented depictions of devatas in the research inventory. The architects also used small apsara images () as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (full-body portraits measuring approximately ) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery, and decorative flowers depicted in the reliefs, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.

===Construction techniques===
By the 12th century, Khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of sandstone rather than brick or laterite as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are sandstone blocks, while laterite was used for the outer wall and hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested. The monument was made of five to ten million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each. The sandstone was quarried and transported from Mount Kulen, a quarry approximately northeast.

The route has been suggested to span along a canal towards Tonlé Sap lake, another crossing the lake, and finally against the current along Siem Reap River, making a total journey of . In 2011, Etsuo Uchida and Ichita Shimoda of Waseda University in Tokyo discovered a shorter canal connecting Mount Kulen and Angkor Wat using satellite imagery and believe that the Khmer used this route instead.

Most of the surfaces, columns, lintels and roofs are carved with reliefs illustrating scenes from Indian literature including unicorns, griffins, winged dragons pulling chariots, as well as warriors following an elephant-mounted leader, and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hairstyles. The gallery wall is decorated with almost of bas reliefs. Holes on some of the Angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets which were highly prized in ancient times and were prime targets for robbers. Based on experiments, the labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone probably ran into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power.

== Symbolism and popular culture ==

Due to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts, the Angkor Wat has become a prominent image that is associated with Cambodia, and in this way has become a symbol of Cambodia itself. A depiction of Angkor Wat has been a part of Cambodian national flag since the introduction of the first version in 1863. 

From a historical and trans-cultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not become a symbol of national pride by itself but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage productions. Angkor Wat caught the attention and imagination of a wider audience in Europe when the pavilion of French protectorate of Cambodia, as part of French Indochina, recreated the life-size replica of Angkor Wat presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. It was on display in the plaster cast museum of Louis Delaporte called &quot;musée Indo-chinois&quot; which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.

== Myths ==
According to the 13th-century Chinese traveller Zhou Daguan, some believed that the temple was constructed in a single night by a divine architect. In 1622, &quot;The Poem of Angkor Wat&quot; composed in Khmer language describes the beauty of Angkor Wat and propagates a legend around the construction of the complex, supposedly a divine castle built for legendary Khmer king Preah Ket Mealea by Hindu god Preah Pisnukar (or Braḥ Bisṇukār, Vishvakarman). In the 17th century, the Japanese believed that the temple was the location of the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which was originally located in the kingdom of Magadha, India. According to another myth, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered by Indra to serve as a palace for his son Precha Ket Mealea. 

== Tourism ==


Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination. In 1993, there were only 7,650 visitors to the site and by 2004, government figures show that 561,000 foreign visitors had arrived in Siem Reap province that year, approximately 50% of all foreign tourists in Cambodia. The number reached over a million in 2007 and over two million by 2012. Angkor Wat received over two million foreign tourists in 2013 and 2.6 million by 2018.

The site was managed by the private SOKIMEX group between 1990 and 2016, which rented it from the Cambodian government. The influx of tourists has caused damage such as graffiti on the walls. Ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—as of 2000 approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the entire Angkor site was spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the Cambodian authorities.

Since Angkor Wat has seen significant growth in tourism throughout the years, UNESCO and its International Co-ordinating Committee for the Safeguarding and Development of the Historic Site of Angkor (ICC), in association with representatives from the Royal Government and APSARA, organised seminars to discuss the concept of &quot;cultural tourism&quot;, emphasising the importance of providing high-quality accommodation and services to the tourists and for the Cambodian government to benefit economically, while also incorporating the richness of Cambodian culture. In 2001, this incentive resulted in the concept of the &quot;Angkor Tourist City&quot; which would be developed about traditional Khmer architecture, contain leisure and tourist facilities, and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists.

The prospect of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism developments in the area have neglected construction regulations and that more of these projects have the potential to damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town&#x27;s water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has also been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for infrastructure has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the atmosphere of their town have been compromised to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture. At the ASEAN Tourism Forum 2012, it was agreed that Borobudur and Angkor Wat would become sister sites and the provinces sister provinces.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to travel restrictions being introduced across the world, which had a severe impact on Cambodia&#x27;s tourism sector. As a result, visitors to Angkor Wat plummeted, leaving the usually crowded complex almost deserted. Cambodia, including Angkor Wat, reopened to international visitors in late 2021, but as of the end of 2022 had only received a fraction of its pre-pandemic traffic: a total of 280,000 tourists visited the complex in 2022, versus 2.6 million in 2018. In 2023, the temple saw an increase in numbers over the previous year, having over 400,000 tourists by late July. Tourists reenacting the 2011 game series &quot;Temple Run&quot; in mid-2024 for social media have drawn criticism from conservationists who warn that it risks damaging Angkor Wat&#x27;s structures and carvings and is culturally insensitive.

<text>Edward FitzGerald, 7th Duke of Leinster, etc. (6 May 1892 – 8 March 1976), known as Lord Edward FitzGerald before 1922, was Ireland&#x27;s Premier Peer of the Realm.

==Life==
Leinster was the youngest of the three sons born to Gerald, 5th Duke of Leinster, and his wife, the former Lady Hermione Duncombe.

He served in World War I, including taking part in the Gallipoli campaign.

He inherited the Dukedom in February 1922, upon the death of his eldest brother, Maurice FitzGerald, 6th Duke of Leinster, who never married and was confined to a mental institution at the time of his death.

An addicted gambler, Leinster enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle, including motor racing. He had already signed away his possible reversionary rights to the family&#x27;s ancestral seat, Carton House, near Maynooth in County Kildare, not expecting that he would inherit the property and the title. He chose to live in England and his estates remained in the possession of the beneficiary, Sir Harry Mallaby-Deeley, 1st Baronet, during the Duke&#x27;s lifetime.

In 1936, Leinster testified at a bankruptcy hearing that he had travelled to the United States in 1928 in order to find an heiress to marry and that during his trip he &quot;entertained lavishly on borrowed money in efforts to find an American wife who would pay off his debts&quot;. Two heiresses appeared to be interested but both eventually declined to become Duchess of Leinster.

Unable to repay his debts, the duke spent the final years of his life living in a small bedsit in Pimlico. He died by suicide in 1976 by taking an overdose of pentobarbital.

==Personal life==
The Duke of Leinster married four times, his wives being:
#The first wife was May Juanita Etheridge (4 August 1892 – 11 February 1935), a chorus girl and actress on the London Stage nicknamed the &quot;Pink Pajama Girl&quot;, whom he married, in London, on 12 June 1913. She was daughter of Jesse Edward Etheridge, a salesman, buried at Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve, Gloucestershire, and son of a George Etheridge and wife ..., and his wife, the former Theresa Grace Harriett Ann Summerell. They separated in 1922, whereupon the duke paid his estranged wife approximately $50 a week, &quot;on condition that she live in retirement and make no effort to communicate with her son&quot;. The duke sued the duchess for divorce in 1926, citing a George Frederick Newell as co-respondent. The couple finally divorced in 1930, with Stanley Williams, &quot;a young chef&quot;, being named as co-respondent. After the end of her marriage, the duchess took the name May Murray by deed poll.. In 1935 she committed suicide by an overdose of sleeping draught. The Leinsters had one child, a son,
#*Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Duke of Leinster (27 May 1914 – 3 December 2004)
#The second wife was (Agnes) Raffaelle Van Neck (14 December 1902 – 28 December 1993, London), an American socialite, who was the former wife of Clare Van Neck and the only child of Robert Davidson Kennedy and his first wife, the former May Nutting. The Duke and Mrs Van Neck married in London on 1 December 1932; they divorced in 1946, after some years of living in Scotland, the duke saying, &quot;She said she could not live with black-faced sheep and lochs, and I saw a certain amount of truth in that&quot;.
#The third wife was Jessie Wessel, a former actress and music-hall performer, known professionally as Denise Orme (1884–1960). She was the maternal grandmother of Prince Aga Khan IV. Born Jessie Smither, daughter of a bartender named Alfred Smither, she had become a music-hall performer and then married and divorced firstly Danish diplomat Theodor William Wessel, and secondly The 3rd Baron Churston; Leinster became her third husband on 11 March 1946. By this marriage, the duke acquired seven stepchildren, including Joan Yarde-Buller, known at that time (1936–49) as Princess Taj-ud-dawlah, mother of Prince Aga Khan IV (born 1936).
#The fourth wife was Vivien Irene Conner, a waitress (19 February 1920 – Brighton, Sussex, 1992), the former wife of George William Conner and a daughter of Thomas Felton. She and the duke married in 1965. By this marriage, the duke had a stepson, Tony Conner.

The duke had an illegitimate son by Yvonne Denison Percy Probyn (later known as Yvonne FitzGerald), daughter of Col. J. Percy Probyn:
*Adrian Dighton Desmond FitzGerald (born 1952), who wed twice. His wives and children were:
**Colleen Theresa Cross, married 1972, divorced 1975. They had one child,
***Kirsty FitzGerald (born 1973), wife of Andrew Keetch
**Linda Jane Harris Clark, married 1982, divorced 1992

<text>Rosenheim is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the south of Bavaria, Germany.
Neighboring districts are, clockwise from the west, Miesbach, Munich, Ebersberg, Mühldorf, and Traunstein, with the Austrian province Tirol across the southern border.
The district entirely surrounds the city of Rosenheim, which is independently administered but hosts the district&#x27;s administration; both the city and the district share the &quot;RO&quot; designation for their license plates.

==History==
The district was created in 1972 when the former districts Rosenheim, Bad Aibling, and parts of Wasserburg am Inn were merged.

==Geography==
The Rosenheim district is located in the foothills of the Alps, the Chiemgau. The landscape is dominated by moraines created by the Inn Glacier in the last glacial period, including many lakes. To the east of the district is the largest of these lakes, the Chiemsee. The main rivers in the district are the Inn and the Mangfall, which meet in the city of Rosenheim.

Mountain ranges in the south of the district include the &quot;Chiemgauer Alpen&quot; and the &quot;Mangfallgebirge&quot;, which also contains the &quot;Wendelstein&quot;, at the highest elevation in the district.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms includes the distinctive Bavarian fusily at the top. The crossed leaves of the water lily on the left are taken from the Frauenchiemsee coat of arms, symbolizing the Chiemsee area of the district, and the red lion represents the city of Wasserburg. The coat of arms was granted in 1976.

<doc id="189369" wikidata="Q615485" url="?curid=189369" title="Birthday attack">
<text>A birthday attack is a bruteforce collision attack that exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory. This attack can be used to abuse communication between two or more parties. The attack depends on the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts and a fixed degree of permutations (pigeonholes). Let formula_1 be the number of possible values of a hash function, with formula_2. With a birthday attack, it is possible to find a collision of a hash function with formula_3 chance in formula_4 where formula_5 is the bit length of the hash output, and with formula_6 being the classical preimage resistance security with the same probability. There is a general (though disputed) result that quantum computers can perform birthday attacks, thus breaking collision resistance, in formula_7.

Although there are some digital signature vulnerabilities associated with the birthday attack, it cannot be used to break an encryption scheme any faster than a brute-force attack.

==Understanding the problem==

As an example, consider the scenario in which a teacher with a class of 30 students (n = 30) asks for everybody&#x27;s birthday (for simplicity, ignore leap years) to determine whether any two students have the same birthday (corresponding to a hash collision as described further). Intuitively, this chance may seem small. Counter-intuitively, the probability that at least one student has the same birthday as &quot;any&quot; other student on any day is around 70% (for n = 30), from the formula formula_8.

If the teacher had picked a &quot;specific&quot; day (say, 16 September), then the chance that at least one student was born on that specific day is formula_9, about 7.9%.

In a birthday attack, the attacker prepares many different variants of benign and malicious contracts, each having a digital signature. A pair of benign and malicious contracts with the same signature is sought. In this fictional example, suppose that the digital signature of a string is the first byte of its SHA-256 hash. The pair found is indicated in green – note that finding a pair of benign contracts (blue) or a pair of malicious contracts (red) is useless. After the victim accepts the benign contract, the attacker substitutes it with the malicious one and claims the victim signed it, as proven by the digital signature.

=== Relation to the balls into bins problem ===
The birthday attack can be modelled as a variation of the balls into bins problem, where balls (hash function inputs) are randomly placed into bins (hash function outputs). A hash collision occurs when at least two balls are placed into the same bin.

==Mathematics==
Given a function formula_10, the goal of the attack is to find two different inputs formula_11 such that formula_12. Such a pair formula_11 is called a collision. The method used to find a collision is simply to evaluate the function formula_10 for different input values that may be chosen randomly or pseudorandomly until the same result is found more than once. Because of the birthday problem, this method can be rather efficient. Specifically, if a function formula_15 yields any of formula_16 different outputs with equal probability and formula_16 is sufficiently large, then we expect to obtain a pair of different arguments formula_18 and formula_19 with formula_12 after evaluating the function for about formula_21 different arguments on average.

We consider the following experiment. From a set of &quot;H&quot; values we choose &quot;n&quot; values uniformly at random thereby allowing repetitions. Let &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;; &quot;H&quot;) be the probability that during this experiment at least one value is chosen more than once. This probability can be approximated as 
: formula_22
where formula_23 is the number of chosen values (inputs) and formula_16 is the number of possible outcomes (possible hash outputs).

Let &quot;n&quot;(&quot;p&quot;; &quot;H&quot;) be the smallest number of values we have to choose, such that the probability for finding a collision is at least &quot;p&quot;. By inverting this expression above, we find the following approximation

: formula_25

and assigning a 0.5 probability of collision we arrive at

: formula_26

Let &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) be the expected number of values we have to choose before finding the first collision. This number can be approximated by

: formula_27

As an example, if a 64-bit hash is used, there are approximately different outputs. If these are all equally probable (the best case), then it would take &#x27;only&#x27; approximately 5 billion attempts () to generate a collision using brute force. This value is called birthday bound and it could be approximated as 2&quot;l&quot;/2, where &quot;l&quot; is the number of bits in H. Other examples are as follows:
:&quot;Table shows number of hashes n&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)&quot; needed to achieve the given probability of success, assuming all hashes are equally likely. For comparison, &#x27; to &#x27; is the uncorrectable bit error rate of a typical hard disk. In theory, MD5 hashes or UUIDs, being roughly 128 bits, should stay within that range until about 820 billion documents, even if its possible outputs are many more.&quot;

It is easy to see that if the outputs of the function are distributed unevenly, then a collision could be found even faster. The notion of &#x27;balance&#x27; of a hash function quantifies the resistance of the function to birthday attacks (exploiting uneven key distribution.) However, determining the balance of a hash function will typically require all possible inputs to be calculated and thus is infeasible for popular hash functions such as the MD and SHA families.
The subexpression formula_28 in the equation for formula_29 is not computed accurately for small formula_30 when directly translated into common programming languages as codice_1 due to loss of significance. When codice_2 is available (as it is in C99) for example, the equivalent expression codice_3 should be used instead. If this is not done, the first column of the above table is computed as zero, and several items in the second column do not have even one correct significant digit.

===Simple approximation===
A good rule of thumb which can be used for mental calculation is the relation

:formula_31

which can also be written as

:formula_32.

or

:formula_33.

This works well for probabilities less than or equal to 0.5.

This approximation scheme is especially easy to use when working with exponents. For instance, suppose you are building 32-bit hashes (formula_34) and want the chance of a collision to be at most one in a million (formula_35), how many documents could we have at the most?

:formula_36

which is close to the correct answer of 93.

==Digital signature susceptibility==
Digital signatures can be susceptible to a birthday attack or more precisely a chosen-prefix collision attack. A message formula_37 is typically signed by first computing formula_38, where formula_10 is a cryptographic hash function, and then using some secret key to sign formula_38. Suppose Mallory wants to trick Bob into signing a fraudulent contract. Mallory prepares a fair contract formula_37 and a fraudulent one formula_42. She then finds a number of positions where formula_37 can be changed without changing the meaning, such as inserting commas, empty lines, one versus two spaces after a sentence, replacing synonyms, etc. By combining these changes, she can create a huge number of variations on formula_37 which are all fair contracts.

In a similar manner, Mallory also creates a huge number of variations on the fraudulent contract formula_42. She then applies the hash function to all these variations until she finds a version of the fair contract and a version of the fraudulent contract which have the same hash value, formula_46. She presents the fair version to Bob for signing. After Bob has signed, Mallory takes the signature and attaches it to the fraudulent contract. This signature then &quot;proves&quot; that Bob signed the fraudulent contract.

The probabilities differ slightly from the original birthday problem, as Mallory gains nothing by finding two fair or two fraudulent contracts with the same hash. Mallory&#x27;s strategy is to generate pairs of one fair and one fraudulent contract. For a given hash function formula_47 is the number of possible hashes, where formula_48 is the bit length of the hash output. 
The birthday problem equations do not exactly apply here. For a 50% chance of a collision, Mallory would need to generate approximately formula_49 hashes, which is twice the number required for a simple collision under the classical birthday problem.

To avoid this attack, the output length of the hash function used for a signature scheme can be chosen large enough so that the birthday attack becomes computationally infeasible, i.e. about twice as many bits as are needed to prevent an ordinary brute-force attack.

Besides using a larger bit length, the signer (Bob) can protect himself by making some random, inoffensive changes to the document before signing it, and by keeping a copy of the contract he signed in his own possession, so that he can at least demonstrate in court that his signature matches that contract, not just the fraudulent one.

Pollard&#x27;s rho algorithm for logarithms is an example for an algorithm using a birthday attack for the computation of discrete logarithms.

===Reverse attack===
The same fraud is possible if the signer is Mallory, not Bob. Bob could suggest a contract to Mallory for a signature. Mallory could find both an inoffensively-modified version of this fair contract that has the same signature as a fraudulent contract, and Mallory could provide the modified fair contract and signature to Bob. Later, Mallory could produce the fraudulent copy. If Bob doesn&#x27;t have the inoffensively-modified version contract (perhaps only finding their original proposal), Mallory&#x27;s fraud is perfect. If Bob does have it, Mallory can at least claim that it is Bob who is the fraudster.

<doc id="189371" wikidata="Q1061596" url="?curid=189371" title="Lactobacillus">
<text>Lactobacillus is a genus of gram-positive, aerotolerant anaerobes or microaerophilic, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacteria. Until 2020, the genus &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; comprised over 260 phylogenetically, ecologically, and metabolically diverse species; a taxonomic revision of the genus assigned lactobacilli to 25 genera (see below).

&quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species constitute a significant component of the human and animal microbiota at a number of body sites, such as the digestive system and the female genital system. In women of European ancestry, &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species are normally a major part of the vaginal microbiota. &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; forms biofilms in the vaginal and gut microbiota, allowing them to persist in harsh environmental conditions and maintain ample populations. &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; exhibits a mutualistic relationship with the human body, as it protects the host against potential invasions by pathogens, and in turn, the host provides a source of nutrients. Lactobacilli are among the most common probiotic found in food such as yogurt, and the bacteria are diverse in their application in maintaining human well-being, by helping to treat diarrhea, vaginal infections, and skin disorders such as eczema.

== Metabolism ==

Lactobacilli are homofermentative, i.e., hexoses are metabolized by glycolysis to lactate as the major end product, or heterofermentative, i.e., hexoses are metabolized by the Phosphoketolase pathway to lactate, CO2, and acetate or ethanol as major end products. Most lactobacilli are aerotolerant and some species respire if heme and menaquinone are present in the growth medium. Aerotolerance of lactobacilli is manganese-dependent and has been explored (and explained) in &quot;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&quot; (previously &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum)&quot;. Lactobacilli generally do not require iron for growth.

The &quot;Lactobacillaceae&quot; are the only family of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that includes homofermentative and heterofermentative organisms; in the &quot;Lactobacillaceae&quot;, homofermentative or heterofermentative metabolism is shared by all strains of a genus. &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species are all homofermentative, do not express pyruvate formate lyase, and most species do not ferment pentoses. In &quot;L. crispatus&quot;, pentose metabolism is strain specific and acquired by lateral gene transfer.

==Genomes==
The genomes of lactobacilli are highly variable, ranging in size from 1.2 to 4.9 Mb (megabases). Accordingly, the number of protein-coding genes ranges from 1,267 to about 4,758 genes (in &quot;Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis&quot; and &quot;Lentilactobacillus parakefiri&quot;, respectively). Even within a single species, there can be substantial variation. For instance, strains of &quot;L. crispatus&quot; have genome sizes ranging from 1.83 to 2.7 Mb, or 1,839 to 2,688 open reading frames. &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; contains a wealth of compound microsatellites in the coding region of the genome, which are imperfect and have variant motifs. Many lactobacilli also contain multiple plasmids. A recent study has revealed that plasmids encode the genes which are required for adaptation of lactobacilli to the given environment.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; currently contains 44 species which are adapted to vertebrate hosts or to insects. In recent years, other members of the genus &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; (formerly known as the &quot;Leuconostoc&quot; branch of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;) have been reclassified into the genera &quot;Atopobium&quot;, &quot;Carnobacterium&quot;, &quot;Weissella&quot;, &quot;Oenococcus&quot;, and &quot;Leuconostoc&quot;. The &quot;Pediococcus&quot; species &quot;P. dextrinicus&quot; has been reclassified as a &quot;Lapidilactobacillus dextrinicus&quot; and most lactobacilli were assigned to &quot;Paralactobacillus&quot; or one of the 23 novel genera of the &quot;Lactobacillaceae.&quot; Two websites inform on the assignment of species to the novel genera or species (http://www.lactobacillus.uantwerpen.be/; http://www.lactobacillus.ualberta.ca/).

==Phylogeny==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature and the phylogeny is based on whole-genome sequences.

== Human health ==
=== Vaginal tract ===
&quot;Lactobacillus&quot; s.s. species are considered &quot;keystone species&quot; in the vaginal flora of reproductive-age women. Most, but not all, healthy women have vaginal floras dominated by one of four species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;: &quot;L. iners&quot;, &quot;L. crispatus&quot;, &quot;L. gasseri&quot;, and &quot;L. jensenii&quot;. Other women have a more diverse mix of anaerobic microorganisms and are still considered to have a healthy microbiome.

=== Interactions with pathogens ===
Lactobacilli produce lactic acid, which contributes to the vaginal acidity, and this lowered pH is generally accepted to be the main mechanism controlling the composition of the vaginal microflora.

Lactobacilli are also proposed to produce hydrogen peroxide, which inhibits the growth and virulence of the fungal pathogen &quot;Candida albicans&quot; &quot;in vitro&quot;, though this is arguably not the main mechanism &quot;in vivo&quot;.

&quot;In vitro&quot; studies have also shown that lactobacilli reduce the pathogenicity of &quot;C. albicans&quot; through the production of organic acids and certain metabolites. Both the presence of metabolites, such as sodium butyrate, and decrease in environmental pH caused by the organic acids reduce the growth of hyphae in &quot;C. albicans&quot;, which reduces its pathogenicity. Lactobacilli also reduce the pathogenicity of &quot;C. albicans&quot; by reducing &quot;C. albicans&quot; biofilm formation. On the other hand, following antibiotic therapy, certain &quot;Candida&quot; species can suppress the regrowth of lactobacilli at body sites where they cohabitate, such as in the gastrointestinal tract.

In addition to its effects on &quot;C. albicans&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; sp. also interact with other pathogens. For example, &quot;Limosilactobacillus reuteri&quot; (formerly &quot;Lactobacillus reuteri&quot;) can inhibit the growth of many different bacterial species by using glycerol to produce the antimicrobial substance called reuterin. Another example is &quot;Ligilactobacillus salivarius (&quot;formerly &quot;Lactobacillus salivarius&quot;), which interacts with many pathogens through the production of salivaricin B, a bacteriocin.

=== Probiotics ===
Because of the interactions with other microbes, fermenting bacteria like lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are now in use as probiotics with many applications.

Lactobacilli administered in combination with other probiotics provides benefits in cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although the extent of efficacy is still uncertain. The probiotics help treat IBS by re-establishing homeostasis when the gut microbiota experiences unusually high levels of opportunistic bacteria. In addition, lactobacilli can be administered as probiotics during cases of infection by the ulcer-causing bacterium &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;. &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; is linked to cancer, and antibiotic resistance impedes the success of current antibiotic-based eradication treatments. When probiotic lactobacilli are administered along with the treatment as an adjuvant, its efficacy is substantially increased and side effects may be lessened. In addition, lactobacilli with other probiotic organisms in ripened milk and yogurt aid development of immunity in the intestine mucus in humans by raising the number of immunoglobulin A (IgA (+)) antiodies.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition associated with bile acid-induced oxidative stress and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in esophageal tissues that cause inflammation and DNA damage. In an experimental model of GERD, &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species &quot;(L. acidophilus&quot;, &quot;L. plantarum&quot;, and &quot;L. fermentum&quot;) facilitated the repair of DNA damage caused by bile-induced ROS. For patients with GERD, there is significant interest in the anti-inflammatory effect of lactobacilli that may help prevent progression to Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma.
Given the known microbial associations, lactobacilli are currently available as probiotics to help control urogenital and vaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV). Lactobacilli produce bacteriocins to suppress th pathogenic growth of certain bacteria, as well as lactic acid, which lowers the vaginal pH to around 4.5 or less, hampering the survival of other bacteria. 

In children, lactobacilli such as &quot;Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus&quot; (previously &quot;L. rhamnosus&quot;) are associated with a reduction of atopic eczema, also known as dermatitis, due to anti-inflammatory cytokines secreted by this probiotic bacteria. 

=== Oral health ===

Some lactobacilli have been associated with cases of dental caries (cavities). Lactic acid can corrode teeth, and the &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; count in saliva has been used as a &quot;caries test&quot; for many years. Lactobacilli characteristically cause existing carious lesions to progress, especially those in coronal caries. The issue is, however, complex, as recent studies show probiotics can allow beneficial lactobacilli to populate sites on teeth, preventing streptococcal pathogens from taking hold and inducing dental decay. The scientific research of lactobacilli in relation to oral health is a new field and only a few studies and results have been published. Some studies have provided evidence of certain lactobacilli which can be a probiotic for oral health. Some species, but not all, show evidence in defense to dental caries. Due to these studies, there have been applications of incorporating such probiotics in chewing gum and lozenges. There is also evidence of certain lactobacilli that are beneficial in the defense of periodontal disease such as gingivitis and periodontitis.

== Food production ==
Species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; (and related genera) comprise many food fermenting lactic acid bacteria and are used as starter cultures in industry for controlled fermentation in the production of wine, yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, pickles, beer, cider, kimchi, cocoa, kefir, and other fermented foods, as well as animal feeds and the bokashi soil amendment. &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species are dominant in yogurt, cheese, and sourdough fermentations. 

Their importance in fermentation comes from both metabolism of the food itself, as well as the inhibition of growth of other potentially pathogenic microbes. The antibacterial and antifungal activity of lactobacilli relies on production of bacteriocins and low molecular weight compounds that inhibit these microorganisms.

Sourdough bread is made either spontaneously, by taking advantage of the bacteria naturally present in flour, or by using a &quot;starter culture&quot;, which is a symbiotic culture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria growing in a water and flour medium. The bacteria metabolize sugars into lactic acid, which lowers the pH of their environment and creates the signature sourness associated with yogurt, sauerkraut, etc.

In many traditional pickling processes, vegetables are submerged in brine, and salt-tolerant lactobacilli feed on natural sugars found in the vegetables. The resulting mix of salt and lactic acid is a hostile environment for other microbes, such as fungi, and the vegetables are thus preserved, remaining edible for long periods.

Lactobacilli, especially &quot;Pediococcus&quot; and &quot;L. brevis&quot;, are some of the most common beer spoilage organisms. They are, however, essential to the production of sour beers such as Belgian lambics and American wild ales, giving the beer a distinct tart flavor.

Scientist Elie Metchnikoff won a Nobel prize in 1908 for his work on LAB, the connection to food, and possible usage as a probiotic.

<text>Actuarial science is the discipline that applies mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, pension, finance, investment and other industries and professions.

Actuaries are professionals trained in this discipline. In many countries, actuaries must demonstrate their competence by passing a series of rigorous professional examinations focused in fields such as probability and predictive analysis.

Actuarial science includes a number of interrelated subjects, including mathematics, probability theory, statistics, finance, economics, financial accounting and computer science. Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. The science has gone through revolutionary changes since the 1980s due to the proliferation of high speed computers and the union of stochastic actuarial models with modern financial theory.

Many universities have undergraduate and graduate degree programs in actuarial science. In 2010, a study published by job search website CareerCast ranked actuary as the #1 job in the United States. The study used five key criteria to rank jobs: environment, income, employment outlook, physical demands, and stress. In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked actuary as the third-best job in the business sector and the eighth-best job in STEM.

==Subfields==
===Life insurance, pensions and healthcare===
Actuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, life insurance, and annuities. These long term coverages required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, as well as the development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This led to the development of an important actuarial concept, referred to as the present value of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern financial economics.

* In traditional life insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of mortality, the production of life tables, and the application of compound interest to produce life insurance, annuities and endowment policies. Contemporary life insurance programs have been extended to include credit and mortgage insurance, key person insurance for small businesses, long term care insurance and health savings accounts.
* In health insurance, including insurance provided directly by employers, and social insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of rates of disability, morbidity, mortality, fertility and other contingencies. The effects of consumer choice and the geographical distribution of the utilization of medical services and procedures, and the utilization of drugs and therapies, is also of great importance. These factors underlay the development of the Resource-Base Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) at Harvard in a multi-disciplined study. Actuarial science also aids in the design of benefit structures, reimbursement standards, and the effects of proposed government standards on the cost of healthcare.
* In the pension industry, actuarial methods are used to measure the costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of pension plans. The strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and long-term bond rates, the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements, collective bargaining; the employer&#x27;s old, new and foreign competitors; the changing demographics of the workforce; changes in the internal revenue code; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses; and equally importantly, both the short and long term financial and economic trends. It is common with mergers and acquisitions that several pension plans have to be combined or at least administered on an equitable basis. When benefit changes occur, old and new benefit plans have to be blended, satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations, and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths. Benefit plans liabilities have to be properly valued, reflecting both earned benefits for past service, and the benefits for future service. Finally, funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States.
* In social welfare programs, the Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT), Social Security Administration plans and directs a program of actuarial estimates and analyses relating to SSA-administered retirement, survivors and disability insurance programs and to proposed changes in those programs. It evaluates operations of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, conducts studies of program financing, performs actuarial and demographic research on social insurance and related program issues involving mortality, morbidity, utilization, retirement, disability, survivorship, marriage, unemployment, poverty, old age, families with children, etc., and projects future workloads. In addition, the Office is charged with conducting cost analyses relating to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, a general-revenue financed, means-tested program for low-income aged, blind and disabled people. The office provides technical and consultative services to the Commissioner, to the board of trustees of the Social Security Trust Funds, and its staff appears before Congressional Committees to provide expert testimony on the actuarial aspects of Social Security issues.

===Applications to other forms of insurance===
Actuarial science is also applied to property, casualty, liability, and general insurance. In these forms of insurance, coverage is generally provided on a renewable period, (such as a yearly). Coverage can be cancelled at the end of the period by either party.

Property and casualty insurance companies tend to specialize because of the complexity and diversity of risks. One division is to organize around personal and commercial lines of insurance. Personal lines of insurance are for individuals and include fire, auto, homeowners, theft and umbrella coverages. Commercial lines address the insurance needs of businesses and include property, business continuation, product liability, fleet/commercial vehicle, workers compensation, fidelity and surety, and D&amp;O insurance. The insurance industry also provides coverage for exposures such as catastrophe, weather-related risks, earthquakes, patent infringement and other forms of corporate espionage, terrorism, and &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot; (e.g., satellite launch). Actuarial science provides data collection, measurement, estimating, forecasting, and valuation tools to provide financial and underwriting data for management to assess marketing opportunities and the nature of the risks. Actuarial science often helps to assess the overall risk from catastrophic events in relation to its underwriting capacity or surplus.

In the reinsurance fields, actuarial science can be used to design and price reinsurance and retrocession arrangements, and to establish reserve funds for known claims and future claims and catastrophes.

===Actuaries in criminal justice===
There is an increasing trend to recognize that actuarial skills can be applied to a range of applications outside the traditional fields of insurance, pensions, etc. One notable example is the use in some US states of actuarial models to set criminal sentencing guidelines. These models attempt to predict the chance of re-offending according to rating factors which include the type of crime, age, educational background and ethnicity of the offender. However, these models have been open to criticism as providing justification for discrimination against specific ethnic groups by law enforcement personnel. Whether this is statistically correct or a self-fulfilling correlation remains under debate.

Another example is the use of actuarial models to assess the risk of sex offense recidivism. Actuarial models and associated tables, such as the MnSOST-R, Static-99, and SORAG, have been used since the late 1990s to determine the likelihood that a sex offender will re-offend and thus whether he or she should be institutionalized or set free.

===Actuarial science related to modern financial economics===
Traditional actuarial science and modern financial economics in the US have different practices, which is caused by different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies, and by different regulations.

Regulations are from the Armstrong investigation of 1905, the Glass–Steagall Act of 1932, the adoption of the Mandatory Security Valuation Reserve by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which cushioned market fluctuations, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, (FASB) in the US and Canada, which regulates pensions valuations and funding.

==History==
Historically, much of the foundation of actuarial theory predated modern financial theory. In the early twentieth century, actuaries were developing many techniques that can be found in modern financial theory, but for various historical reasons, these developments did not achieve much recognition.

As a result, actuarial science developed along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, as opposed to the arbitrage-free risk-neutral valuation concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the discount rate assumption). This concept is inconsistent with financial economics.

The potential of modern financial economics theory to complement existing actuarial science was recognized by actuaries in the mid-twentieth century. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a distinct effort for actuaries to combine financial theory and stochastic methods into their established models. Ideas from financial economics became increasingly influential in actuarial thinking, and actuarial science has started to embrace more sophisticated mathematical modelling of finance. Today, the profession, both in practice and in the educational syllabi of many actuarial organizations, is cognizant of the need to reflect the combined approach of tables, loss models, stochastic methods, and financial theory. However, assumption-dependent concepts are still widely used (such as the setting of the discount rate assumption as mentioned earlier), particularly in North America.

Product design adds another dimension to the debate. Financial economists argue that pension benefits are bond-like and should not be funded with equity investments without reflecting the risks of not achieving expected returns. But some pension products do reflect the risks of unexpected returns. In some cases, the pension beneficiary assumes the risk, or the employer assumes the risk. The current debate now seems to be focusing on four principles:
# financial models should be free of arbitrage.
# assets and liabilities with identical cash flows should have the same price. This is at odds with FASB.
# the value of an asset is independent of its financing.
# how pension assets should be invested

Essentially, financial economics state that pension assets should not be invested in equities for a variety of theoretical and practical reasons.

===Pre-formalisation===
Elementary mutual aid agreements and pensions arose in antiquity. Early in the Roman empire, associations were formed to meet the expenses of burial, cremation, and monuments—precursors to burial insurance and friendly societies. A small sum was paid into a communal fund on a weekly basis, and upon the death of a member, the fund would cover the expenses of rites and burial. These societies sometimes sold shares in the building of columbāria, or burial vaults, owned by the fund—the precursor to mutual insurance companies. Other early examples of mutual surety and assurance pacts can be traced back to various forms of fellowship within the Saxon clans of England and their Germanic forebears, and to Celtic society. However, many of these earlier forms of surety and aid would often fail due to lack of understanding and knowledge.

===Initial development===
The 17th century was a period of advances in mathematics in Germany, France and England. At the same time there was a rapidly growing desire and need to place the valuation of personal risk on a more scientific basis. Independently of each other, compound interest was studied and probability theory emerged as a well-understood mathematical discipline. Another important advance came in 1662 from a London draper, the father of demography, John Graunt, who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group, or cohort, of people of the same age, despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual. This study became the basis for the original life table. One could now set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy how much each person in the group should contribute to a common fund assumed to earn a fixed rate of interest. The first person to demonstrate publicly how this could be done was Edmond Halley (of Halley&#x27;s comet fame). Halley constructed his own life table, and showed how it could be used to calculate the premium amount someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life annuity.

===Early actuaries===
James Dodson&#x27;s pioneering work on the long term insurance contracts under which the same premium is charged each year led to the formation of the Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorship (now commonly known as Equitable Life) in London in 1762. William Morgan is often considered the father of modern actuarial science for his work in the field in the 1780s and 90s. Many other life insurance companies and pension funds were created over the following 200 years. Equitable Life was the first to use the word &quot;actuary&quot; for its chief executive officer in 1762. Previously, &quot;actuary&quot; meant an official who recorded the decisions, or &quot;acts&quot;, of ecclesiastical courts. Other companies that did not use such mathematical and scientific methods most often failed or were forced to adopt the methods pioneered by Equitable.

===Technological advances===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, calculations were performed without computers. The computations of life insurance premiums and reserving requirements are rather complex, and actuaries developed techniques to make the calculations as easy as possible, for example &quot;commutation functions&quot; (essentially precalculated columns of summations over time of discounted values of survival and death probabilities). Actuarial organizations were founded to support and further both actuaries and actuarial science, and to protect the public interest by promoting competency and ethical standards. However, calculations remained cumbersome, and actuarial shortcuts were commonplace. Non-life actuaries followed in the footsteps of their life insurance colleagues during the 20th century. The 1920 revision for the New-York based National Council on Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Insurance rates took over two months of around-the-clock work by day and night teams of actuaries. In the 1930s and 1940s, the mathematical foundations for stochastic processes were developed. Actuaries could now begin to estimate losses using models of random events, instead of the deterministic methods they had used in the past. The introduction and development of the computer further revolutionized the actuarial profession. From pencil-and-paper to punchcards to current high-speed devices, the modeling and forecasting ability of the actuary has rapidly improved, while still being heavily dependent on the assumptions input into the models, and actuaries needed to adjust to this new world .

<doc id="189379" wikidata="Q1049350" url="?curid=189379" title="Laryngeal theory">
<text>The laryngeal theory is a theory in historical linguistics positing that the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language included a number of laryngeal consonants that are not reconstructable by direct application of the comparative method to the Indo-European family. The &quot;missing&quot; sounds remain consonants of an indeterminate place of articulation towards the back of the mouth, though further information is difficult to derive. Proponents aim to use the theory to:
* Produce greater regularity in the reconstruction of PIE phonology than from the reconstruction that is produced by the comparative method. 
* Extend the general occurrence of the Indo-European ablaut to syllables with reconstructed vowel phonemes other than *e or *o.

In its earlier form (see below), the theory proposed two sounds in PIE. Combined with a reconstructed *e or *o, the sounds produce vowel phonemes that would not otherwise be predicted by the rules of ablaut. 

The theory received considerable support after the deciphering of Hittite, which revealed it to be an Indo-European language. Many Hittite words were shown to be derived from PIE, with a phoneme represented as corresponding to one of the hypothetical PIE sounds. Subsequent scholarly work has established a set of rules by which an ever-increasing number of reflexes in daughter languages may be derived from PIE roots. The number of explanations thus achieved and the simplicity of the postulated system have both led to widespread acceptance of the theory.

In its most widely accepted version, the theory posits three laryngeal phonemes in PIE: h₁, h₂, and h₃ (see below). Daughter languages other than Hittite did not preserve the laryngeals themselves, but inherited sounds derived from the merger of these laryngeals with PIE short vowels and the subsequent loss of those laryngeals.

The phonemes are now recognized as consonants, related to articulation in the general area of the larynx, where a consonantal gesture may affect vowel quality. They are regularly known as laryngeal, but the actual place of articulation for each consonant remains a matter of debate. (see below).

The laryngeals got their name because they were believed by Hermann Möller and Albert Cuny to have had a pharyngeal, epiglottal, or glottal place of articulation, involving a constriction near the larynx. While this is still possible, many linguists now think of laryngeals, or some of them, as having been velar or uvular.

The evidence for their existence is mostly indirect, as will be shown below, but the theory serves as an elegant explanation for several properties of the PIE vowel system that made no sense without the theory, such as the independent schwas (as in &#x27;father&#x27;). Also, the hypothesis that PIE schwa &quot;*ə&quot; was a consonant, not a vowel, provides an explanation for some apparent exceptions to Brugmann&#x27;s law in Indo-Aryan languages.

==History==
The beginnings of the theory were proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure in 1879, in an article chiefly demonstrating that and were separate phonemes in PIE.

In the course of his analysis, Saussure proposed that what had then been reconstructed as long vowels and , alternating with , was an ordinary type of PIE ablaut. That is, it was an alternation between &quot;e&quot; grade and zero grade like in &quot;regular&quot; ablaut (further explanations below), but followed by a previously unidentified element. This element accounted for both the changed vowel colour and the lengthening (short becoming long or ).

So, rather than reconstructing , and as others had done before, Saussure proposed alternating with and with , where and represented the unidentified elements. Saussure called them simply , which was the term for what are now in English more usually called resonants; that is, the six elements present in PIE which can be either consonants (non-syllabic) or vowels (syllabic) depending on the sounds they are adjacent to: *&quot;y w r l m n&quot;.

These views were accepted by a few scholars, in particular Hermann Möller, who added important elements to the theory. Saussure&#x27;s observations, however, did not achieve any general currency, as they were still too abstract and had little direct evidence to back them up.

This changed when Hittite was discovered and deciphered in the early 20th century. Hittite phonology included two sounds written with symbols from the Akkadian syllabary conventionally transcribed as , as in &#x27;I put, am putting&#x27;. This consonant did not appear to be related to any of the consonants then reconstructed for PIE, and various unsatisfactory proposals were made to explain this consonant in terms of the PIE consonant system as it had then been reconstructed.

It remained for Jerzy Kuryłowicz to propose that these sounds lined up with Saussure&#x27;s conjectures. He suggested that the unknown consonant of Hittite was, in fact, a direct reflex of the that Saussure had proposed.

Their appearance explained some other matters as well: For example, why verb roots containing only a consonant and a vowel always have long vowels. For example, in &quot;give&quot;, the new consonants allowed linguists to decompose this further into . This not only accounted for the patterns of alternation more economically than before (by requiring fewer types of ablaut) but also brought the structure of these roots into line with the basic PIE pattern which required roots to begin and end with a consonant.

The lateness of the discovery of these sounds by Indo-Europeanists is largely because Hittite and the other Anatolian languages are the only Indo-European languages for which at least some are attested directly and consistently as consonantal sounds. Otherwise, their presence is to be inferred mostly through the effects they have on neighboring sounds, and on patterns of alternation that they participate in. When a laryngeal is attested directly, it is usually as a special type of vowel and not as a consonant, best exemplified in Greek where syllabic laryngeals (when they appeared next to only consonants) developed as such: &gt; e, &gt; a, and &gt; o.

==Varieties of laryngeals==
There are many variations of the laryngeal theory. Some scholars, such as Oswald Szemerényi, reconstruct just one laryngeal. Some follow Jaan Puhvel&#x27;s reconstruction of eight or more.

===Basic laryngeal set===
Most scholars work with a basic three:

*, the neutral laryngeal
*, the a-colouring laryngeal
*, the o-colouring laryngeal

===Additional laryngeals===
Some scholars suggest the existence of a fourth consonant, , which differs from in not being reflected as Anatolian but being reflected, to the exclusion of all other laryngeals, as Albanian &quot;h&quot; when word-initial before an originally stressed vowel.

E.g. PIE &#x27;testicle&#x27; yields Albanian &#x27;testicle&#x27; but Hittite &#x27;testicle&#x27; whereas PIE &#x27;&quot;bear&#x27; yields Albanian &#x27;bear&#x27; but Hittite (=/hartka-/) &#x27;cultic official, bear-person&#x27;.

When there is an uncertainty whether the laryngeal is or , the symbol may be used.

* doublet
Another such theory, but much less generally accepted, is Winfred P. Lehmann&#x27;s view, based on inconsistent reflexes in Hittite, that was two separate sounds. (He assumed that one was a glottal stop and the other a glottal fricative.)

==Direct evidence for laryngeals==
Some direct evidence for laryngeal consonants comes from Anatolian. 
In PIE *a is a fairly rare sound, and in an uncommonly large number of good etymologies, it is word-initial. Thus PIE (traditional) &#x27;in front of and facing&#x27; &gt;
* Greek &#x27;against&#x27;
* Latin &#x27;in front of, before&#x27;
* Sanskrit &#x27;near; in the presence of&#x27;.

But in Hittite there is the noun &#x27;front, face&#x27;, with various derivatives ( &#x27;first&#x27;, and so on), pointing to a PIE root-noun &#x27;face&#x27; (of which would be the locative singular).

However, it does not follow that all reconstructed forms with initial should automatically be rewritten .

Similarly, the traditional PIE reconstruction for &#x27;sheep&#x27; is (a &quot;y&quot;-stem, not an &quot;i&quot;-stem) whence Sanskrit , Latin , Greek . But Luwian has , indicating instead the reconstruction .

===Lyco-Carian chain shift===
In the Anatolian languages Lycian and Carian, there was a chain shift such that &gt; k &gt; c. In other words, PIE is reflected as in these languages, and PIE *k as . Alwin Kloekhorst takes this as evidence that PIE originally had a value of , but Martin Joachim Kümmel is skeptical of Kloekhorst&#x27;s hypothesis and prefers to model the laryngeals as fricatives.

==Pronunciation==
Considerable debate still surrounds the pronunciation of the laryngeals and various arguments have been given to pinpoint their exact place of articulation. Firstly the effect these sounds have had on adjacent phonemes is well documented. The evidence from Hittite and Uralic is sufficient to conclude that these sounds were guttural, pronounced rather back in the vocal tract. The same evidence is also consistent with the assumption that they were fricative sounds (as opposed to approximants or stops), an assumption that is strongly supported by the behaviour of laryngeals in consonant clusters.

===*h₁===
J.E. Rasmussen suggested a consonantal realization for as the voiceless glottal fricative with a syllabic allophone (mid central unrounded vowel). This is supported by the closeness of to (with which it combines in Greek), its failure (unlike and ) to create an auxiliary vowel in Greek and Tocharian when it occurs between a semivowel and a consonant, and the typological likelihood of an given the presence of aspirated consonants in PIE.

 theorized, based on inconsistent reflexes in Hittite, that there were two sounds: a glottal stop and an &quot;h&quot; sound as in English &quot;hat,&quot; similar to reconstructing and as varying between geminate uvular stops and fricatives in PIE, which is typologically likely given the assumed correspondence of the three PIE laryngeals to the Proto-Uralic laryngeal (possibly velar *x), Finnic *h &lt; Pre-Finnic *š and k (including word-initially) alike in Jorma Koivulehto&#x27;s theories about PIE loans into Proto-Uralic. Robert S. P. Beekes suggested that is always a glottal stop .

Alwin Kloekhorst argued that the Hieroglyphic Luwian sign no. 19 (𔐓, conventionally transcribed &quot;á&quot;) stood for (distinct from , sign no. 450: 𔗷 &quot;a&quot;) and represents the reflex of ; this would support the hypothesis that was, at least in some cases, . Later, Kloekhorst claimed that also Hittite preserves PIE as a glottal stop , visible in words like Hittite &#x27;he is&#x27; &lt; PIE , where an extra initial vowel sign (plene spelling) is used. This hypothesis has been met with serious criticism; &quot;e.g.&quot;, from Elisabeth Rieken, Craig Melchert, and Mark Weeden.

Zsolt Simon supported Kloekhorst&#x27;s thesis by suggesting that plene spelling in Cuneiform Luwian can be explained in a similar way. Additionally, Simon&#x27;s 2013 article revises the Hieroglyphic Luwian evidence and concludes that although some details of Kloekhorst&#x27;s arguments could not be maintained, his theory can be confirmed.

An idea occasionally advanced that the laryngeals were dorsal fricatives corresponding directly to the three traditionally reconstructed series of dorsal stops (palatal, velar, and labiovelar; i.e., that the laryngeals , and are more accurately written , , and respectively) suggests a further possibility, a palatal fricative .

===*h₂===
From what is known of such phonetic conditioning in contemporary languages, notably Semitic languages, (the a-colouring laryngeal) could have been a pharyngeal fricative such as and . Pharyngeal consonants (like &quot;heth&quot; in the Semitic abjads) often cause a-colouring in the Semitic languages.

Uvular fricatives may also colour vowels, thus is also a noteworthy candidate. Weiss (2016) suggests that this was the case in Proto-Indo-European proper, and that a shift from uvular into pharyngeal may have been a common innovation of the non-Anatolian languages (before the consonant&#x27;s eventual loss). Rasmussen (1983) suggested a consonantal realization for as a voiceless velar fricative , with a syllabic allophone , i.e. a near-open central vowel.

Kloekhorst proposes, based on evidence from Anatolian languages, that was originally a geminate uvular stop (he also holds the view that the traditionally voiceless stops of PIE were in fact geminate, as in Hittite), although he judges it plausible that already in PIE it had a fricative allophone.

===*h₃===
Likewise it is generally assumed that was rounded (labialized) due to its o-colouring effects. It is often taken to have been voiced based on the perfect form from the root &quot;drink&quot; and Cowgill&#x27;s law in Proto-Germanic (PIE &quot;→&quot; PPGmc &quot;→&quot; PGmc , &quot;us two&quot;). Rasmussen chose a consonantal realization for as a voiced labialized velar fricative , with a syllabic allophone , i.e. a close-mid central rounded vowel. Kümmel instead suggests .

Kloekhorst reconstructs as the basic value, which in his view would be the labialized counterpart to (see above).

==Support for theory from daughter languages==
The hypothetical existence of laryngeals in PIE finds support in the body of daughter language cognates which can be most efficiently explained through simple rules of development.

===Direct reflexes of laryngeals===
Unambiguous examples are confined to Anatolian languages. Words with Hittite (&quot;hh&quot;), Luwian &quot;h&quot; and Lycian &quot;x&quot; are explained as reflexes of PIE roots with .

Some Hittitologists have also proposed that was preserved in Hittite as , although only word initially and after a resonant. Kortlandt holds that was preserved before all vowels except *o. Similarly, Kloekhorst believes they were lost before resonants as well.

====In Germanic====
Reconstructed instances of *kw in Proto-Germanic have been explained as reflexes of PIE (and possibly ), a process known as Cowgill&#x27;s law. The proposal has been challenged but is defended by Don Ringe.

====In Albanian====
In the Albanian language, a minority view proposes that some instances of word-initial &quot;h&quot; continue a laryngeal consonant.

====In Western Iranian====
Martin Kümmel has proposed that some initial and in contemporary Western Iranian languages, commonly thought to be prothetic, are instead direct survivals of , lost in epigraphic Old Persian but retained in marginal dialects ancestral among others to Modern Persian.


===Proposed indirect reflexes===
In all other daughter languages, a comparison of the cognates can support only hypothetical intermediary sounds derived from PIE combinations of vowels and laryngeals. Some indirect reflexes are required to support the examples above where the existence of laryngeals is uncontested.

The proposals in this table account only for attested forms in daughter languages. Extensive scholarship has produced a large body of cognates which may be identified as reflexes of a small set of hypothetical intermediary sounds, including those in the table above. Individual sets of cognates are explicable by other hypotheses but the sheer bulk of data and the elegance of the laryngeal explanation have led to widespread acceptance in principle.

====Vowel coloration and lengthening====
In the proposed Anatolian-language reflexes above, only some of the vowel sounds reflect PIE . In the daughter languages in general, many vowel sounds are not obvious reflexes. The theory explains this as the result of H coloration and H loss.

:1 H coloration. PIE e}} is coloured (i.e. its sound value is changed) before or after and , but not when next to .

:2 H loss. Any of the three laryngeals (symbolized here as H) is lost before a short vowel. Laryngeals are also lost before another consonant (symbolized here as C), with consequent lengthening of the preceding vowel.

The results of H coloration and H loss are recognized in daughter-language reflexes such as those in the table below:


====Greek triple reflex vs schwa====
Between three phonological contexts, Greek reflexes display a regular vowel pattern that is absent from the supposed cognates in other daughter languages.

Before the development of laryngeal theory, scholars compared Greek, Latin and Sanskrit (then considered earliest daughter languages) and concluded the existence in these contexts of a schwa (ə) vowel in PIE, the &quot;schwa indogermanicum&quot;. The contexts are: 1. between consonants (short vowel); 2. word initial before a consonant (short vowel); 3. combined with a liquid or nasal consonant [r, l, m, n] (long vowel).

:1 Between consonants
::Latin displays a and Sanskrit i, whereas Greek displays e, a, or o.

:2 Word initial before a consonant
::Greek alone displays e, a, or o.

:3 Combined with a liquid or nasal
::Latin displays a liquid/nasal consonant followed by ā; Sanskrit displays either īr/ūr or the vowel ā alone; Greek displays a liquid/nasal consonant followed by ē, ā (in dialects such as Doric), or ō.

Laryngeal theory provides a more elegant general description than reconstructed schwa by assuming that the Greek vowels are derived through vowel colouring and H loss from PIE , , and , constituting a triple reflex.
:1 Between consonants
::An explanation is provided for the existence of three vowel reflexes in Greek corresponding to single reflexes in Latin and in Sanskrit.

:2 Word initial
::The assumption of *HC- in PIE yields an explanation for a dichotomy exhibited below between cognates in the Anatolian, Greek, and Armenian languages reflexes with initial a and cognates in the remaining daughters which lack that syllable, The theory assumes initial in the PIE root, which has been lost in most of the daughter languages.

::These presumed sonorant reflexes are completely distinct from those deemed to have developed from single phonemes. 
The phonology of the sonorant examples in the previous table can only be explained by the presence of adjacent phonemes in PIE. Assuming the phonemes to be a following , , or allows the same rules of vowel coloration and H-loss to apply to both PIE and PIE sonorants.

====Support from Greek ablaut====
The hypothetical values for sounds with laryngeals after H coloration and H loss (such as seen above in the triple reflex) draw much of their support for the regularization they allow in ablaut patterns, specifically the uncontested patterns found in Greek.

=====Ablaut in the root=====
In the following table, each row shows undisputed Greek cognates sharing the three ablaut grades of a root. The four sonorants and the two semivowels are represented as individual letters, other consonants as C and the vowel or its absence as (V).
The reconstructed PIE e grade and zero grade of the above roots may be arranged as follows:
An extension of the table to PIE roots ending in presumed laryngeals allows many Greek cognates to follow a regular ablaut pattern.

=====Ablaut in the suffix=====
The first row of the following table shows how uncontested cognates relate to reconstructed PIE stems with e-grade or zero-grade roots, followed by e grade or zero grade of the suffix . The remaining rows show how the ablaut pattern of other cognates is preserved if the stems are presumed to include the suffixes , , and .

==== Intervocalic H loss ====

In the preceding sections, forms in the daughter languages were explained as reflexes of laryngeals in PIE stems. Since these stems are judged to have contained only one vowel, the explanations involved H loss either when a vowel preceded or when a vowel followed. However, the possibility of H loss between two vowels is present when a stem combines with an inflexional suffix.

It has been proposed that PIE H loss resulted in hiatus, which in turn was contracted to a vowel sound distinct from other long vowels by being disyllabic or of extra length.

=====Early Indo-Iranian disyllables=====
A number of long vowels in Avestan were pronounced as two syllables, and some examples also exist in early Sanskrit, particularly in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. These can be explained as reflexes of contraction following a hiatus caused by the loss of intervocalic H in PIE.

=====Proto-Germanic trimoraic o=====

The reconstructed phonology of Proto-Germanic (PG), the ancestor of the Germanic languages, includes a long phoneme, which is in turn the reflex of PIE . As outlined above, laryngeal theory has identified instances of PIE as reflexes of earlier , or before a consonant.

However, a distinct long PG phoneme has been recognized with a different set of reflexes in daughter languages. The vowel length has been calculated by observing the effect of the shortening of final vowels in Gothic.

Reflexes of trimoraic or overlong are found in the final syllable of nouns or verbs, and are thus associated with inflectional endings. Thus four PG sounds are proposed, shown here with Gothic and Old English reflexes:

A different contrast is observed in endings with final *z:

Laryngeal theory preserves regularities in declensions and conjugations by explaining the trimoraic sound as a reflex of H loss between vowels followed by contraction. Thus
* by H loss *oHo &gt; *oo &gt; *ô;
* by H coloration and H loss *eh₂e &gt; *ae &gt; *â &gt; *ô.

(Trimoraic *ô is also reconstructed as word final in contexts that are not explained by laryngeal theory.)

=====Balto-Slavic long vowel accent=====
The reconstructed phonology of the Balto-Slavic languages posits two distinct long vowels in almost exact correspondence to bimoraic and trimoraic vowels in Proto-Germanic. The Balto-Slavic vowels are distinguished not by length but by intonation; long vowels with circumflex accent correspond to Proto-Germanic trimoraic vowels. A significant proportion of long vowels with an acute accent (also described as with acute register) correspond to Proto-Germanic bimoric vowels. These correspondences have led to the suggestion that the split between them occurred in the last common ancestor of the two daughters.

It has been suggested that acute intonation was associated with glottalization, a suggestion supported by glottalized reflexes in Latvian. This could lend support to a theory that laryngeal consonants developed into glottal stops before their disappearance in Balto-Slavic and Proto-Germanic.

==== H loss adjacent to other sounds ====

=====After stop consonants=====
A significant number of instances of voiceless aspirates in the Indo-Iranian languages may be explained as reflexes of PIE stop consonants immediately followed by laryngeals (*CH &gt; *Cʰ).

=====After resonants=====
PIE resonants (sonorants) , , , are predicted to become consonantal allophones , , , when immediately followed by a vowel. Using R to symbolize any resonant (sonorant) and V for any vowel, *R̥V&gt;*RV. Instances in the daughter languages of a vocalic resonant immediately followed by a vowel (RV) can sometimes be explained as reflexes of PIE *R̥HV with a laryngeal between the resonant and the vowel giving rise to a vocalic allophone. This original vocalic quality was preserved following H loss.

=====Next to semivowels=====
Laryngeal theory has been used to explain the occurrence of a reconstructed sound change known as Holtzmann&#x27;s law or sharpening (German ) in North Germanic and East Germanic languages. The existing theory explains that PIE semivowels and were doubled to Proto-Germanic and , and that these in turn became and respectively in Gothic and and in early North Germanic languages. However, the existing theory had difficulty in predicting which instances of PIE semivowels led to sharpening and which instances failed to do so. The new explanation proposes that words exhibiting sharpening are derived from PIE words with laryngeals.

Many of these techniques rely on the laryngeal being preceded by a vowel, and so they are not readily applicable for word-initial laryngeals except in Greek and Armenian. However, occasionally languages have compounds in which a medial vowel is unexpectedly lengthened or otherwise shows the effect of the following laryngeal. This shows that the second word originally began with a laryngeal and that this laryngeal still existed at the time the compound was formed.

==Support for theory from external borrowings==
Further evidence of the laryngeals has been found in Uralic languages, and some marginal cases also in Kartvelian. While the protolanguages of these families have not been convincingly demonstrated to be genetically related to PIE, some word correspondences have been identified as likely borrowings from very early Indo-European dialects to early Uralic and Kartvelian dialects. In a few such instances, laryngeal consonants reconstructed in PIE stems show correspondences with overt dorsal or laryngeal consonants in the Proto-Uralic and Proto-Kartvelian forms, in effect suggesting that these forms result from very old PIE borrowings where the consonantal nature of the PIE laryngeals was preserved.

===Laryngeals reflected in the Kartvelian languages===
The evidence for the preservation of laryngeals by borrowings into Proto-Kartvelian is meagre, but intriguing.

It has been suggested that some examples of an initial Proto-Kartvelian sequence *&quot;γw&quot;- may reflect sequences of the form *&quot;h&quot;x&quot;w&quot;- borrowed from PIE—cp. e.g. PK *&quot;γweb&quot;- &#x27;to weave&#x27; alongside PIE &#x27;id.&#x27;, PK *&quot;γwel&quot;- &#x27;to turn, to twist&#x27; alongside PIE &#x27;to turn, to roll&#x27;—although evidence for sequences in most of the proposed PIE source terms is controversial and other possible explanations for Proto-Kartvelian *&quot;γw&quot;- sequences exist.

A separate suggestion proposes that the PIE -colouring laryngeal is reflected as Proto-Kartvelian *&quot;x&quot; in two fruit names borrowed from PIE &#x27;apple&#x27;, namely Proto-Kartvelian * &#x27;pear&#x27; and *&quot;sxmart&#x27;l̥&quot;- &#x27;medlar&#x27;, the latter etymologically the &#x27;rotten (*&quot;t&#x27;l̥&quot;-) pear&#x27;.

===Laryngeals reflected in the Uralic languages===
Evidence for the PIE laryngeals has been suggested in ancient loans into Proto-Uralic. Work particularly associated with research of the scholar Jorma Koivulehto has identified several additions to the list of Finnic loanwords from an Indo-European source or sources whose particular interest is the apparent correlation of PIE laryngeals with three postalveolar phonemes (or their later reflexes) in the Finnic forms. If so, this would suggest great antiquity for the borrowings; since no attested Indo-European language neighbouring Uralic has consonants as reflexes of laryngeals, this would bolster the idea that laryngeals were phonetically distinct consonants.

However, Koivulehto&#x27;s theories are not universally accepted and have been sharply criticized (e.g. by Finno-Ugricist Eugene Helimski) because many of the reconstructions involve a great deal of far-fetched hypotheses and the chronology is not in good agreement with the history of Bronze Age and Iron Age migrations in the Eastern Europe established by archaeologists and historians.

Three Uralic phonemes have been posited to reflect PIE laryngeals. In post-vocalic positions both the postalveolar fricatives that ever existed in Uralic are represented: firstly a possibly velar one, theoretically reconstructed much as the PIE laryngeals (conventionally marked *x), in the very oldest borrowings and secondly a grooved one (*š as in &quot;shoe&quot; becoming modern Finnic &quot;h&quot;) in some younger ones. The velar plosive &quot;k&quot; is the third reflex and the only one found word-initially. In intervocalic position, the reflex &quot;k&quot; is probably younger than either of the two former ones. The fact that Finno-Ugric may have plosive reflexes for PIE laryngeals is to be expected under well documented Finnic phonological behaviour and does not mean much for tracing the phonetic value of PIE laryngeals.

The correspondences do not differentiate between , and . Thus
# PIE laryngeals correspond to the PU laryngeal *x in wordstems like:
#*Finnish &#x27;woman&#x27; / &#x27;female&#x27; &lt; PU *näxi-/*naxi- &lt; PIE [] = /-/ &gt; Sanskrit &#x27;goddess&#x27;, OIr. &quot;mná&quot; (gen. of &quot;ben&quot;), ~ Greek &quot;gunē&quot; &#x27;woman&#x27; (cognate to Engl. &quot;queen&quot;)

# PIE laryngeals correspond to Finnic *h, whose normal origin is a Pre-Finnic fricative *š in wordstems like:

# PIE laryngeals correspond to Pre-Finnic *k in wordstems like:

#*Finnish &#x27;to perceive, sense&#x27; &lt; PreFi *koki- &lt; PIE [] = // &gt; Greek &quot;opsomai&quot; &#x27;look, observe&#x27; (cognate to Lat. &#x27;eye&#x27;)
#*Finnish &#x27;to go, walk, wander&#x27; ~ Hungarian &#x27;to go, walk, proceed&#x27; &lt; PFU *kulki- &lt; PIE *kʷelH-e/o- &gt; Greek &quot;pelomai&quot; &#x27;(originally) to be moving&#x27;, Sanskrit &#x27;goes, walks, wanders (about)&#x27;, cognate Lat. &#x27;to till, cultivate, inhabit&#x27;
#*Finnish - &#x27;do, make&#x27; ~ Hungarian , &#x27;to do, make, put, place&#x27; &lt; PFU *teki- &lt; PIE &gt; Greek &quot;títhēmi&quot;, Sanskrit &#x27;put, place&#x27;, but &#x27;do, make&#x27; in the western IE languages, e.g. the Germanic forms &quot;do&quot;, German , etc., and Latin (though OE and into Early Modern English &quot;do&quot; still sometimes means &quot;put&quot;, and or still does in Dutch and colloquial German).

This list is not exhaustive, especially when one also considers several etymologies with laryngeal reflexes in Finno-Ugric languages other than Finnish. For most cases no other plausible etymology exists. While some single etymologies may be challenged, the case for this oldest stratum itself seems conclusive from the Uralic point of view, and corresponds well with all that is known about the dating of the other most ancient borrowings and contacts with Indo-European populations. Yet acceptance for this evidence is far from unanimous among Indo-European linguists, some even regard the hypothesis as controversial (see above). If, on the other hand, the Indo-Uralic hypothesis is supported, the explanation of why the correspondences do not differentiate between , and is that Pre-PIE or Indo-Hittite innovated this difference as a part of developing ablaut, where the zero grade matched ( and [h]), the front-unrounded full (&quot;e&quot;) grade matched (mainstream &gt; and &lt; ) and the back-rounded full (&quot;o&quot;) grade matched (Kümmel&#x27;s uvular &gt; pharyngeal fricative and ).

===PIE laryngeals and Proto-Semitic===
Several linguists have posited a relationship between PIE and Semitic, almost right after the discovery of Hittite. Among these were Hermann Möller, though a few had argued that such a relationship existed before the 20th century, like Richard Lepsius in 1836. The postulated correspondences between the IE laryngeals and that of Semitic assist in demonstrating their evident existence. Given here are a few lexical comparisons between the two respective proto-languages based on Václav Blažek, who discusses these correspondences in the context of a proposed relation between IE and Afroasiatic, the language family to which the Semitic languages belong:

# Semitic &quot;ʼ-b-y&quot; &#x27;to want, desire&#x27; ~ PIE [] &#x27;to fuck&#x27;
# Semitic &quot;ʼ-m-m/y&quot; ~ PIE [] &#x27;to take&#x27;
# Semitic &quot;ʼin-a&quot; &#x27;in&#x27;, &#x27;on&#x27;, &#x27;by&#x27; ~ PIE [] &gt; Sanskrit , ~ Greek &quot;enōpḗ&quot; 
# Semitic &quot;ʼanāku&quot; ~ PIE &#x27;I&#x27;
# Semitic &quot;ʻ-d-w&quot; &#x27;to pass (over), move, run&#x27; ~ PIE [] &#x27;to pass through&#x27;
# Semitic &quot;ʻ-l-y&quot; &#x27;to rise, grow, go up, be high&#x27; ~ PIE [] &#x27;to grow, nourish&#x27;
# Semitic &quot;ʻ-k-w&quot;: Arabic ʻakā &#x27;to rise, be big&#x27; ~ PIE [] &#x27;to grow, nourish&#x27;
# Semitic &quot;ʻl&quot; &#x27;next, in addition&#x27; ~ PIE [] &#x27;in&#x27;
# Semitic: Arabic &quot;ʻanan&quot; &#x27;side&#x27;, &quot;ʻan&quot; &#x27;from, for; upon; in&#x27; ~ PIE [] &#x27;on&#x27;

==Comments==

The Greek forms &quot;ánemos&quot; and&quot; árotron&quot; are particularly valuable because the verb roots in question are extinct in Greek as verbs. This means that there is no possibility of some sort of analogical interference, as, for example, happened in the case of Latin &quot;plow&quot;, whose shape has been distorted by the verb &quot;to plow&quot; (the exact cognate to the Greek form would have been *&quot;aretrum&quot;). It used to be standard to explain the root vowels of Greek &quot;thetós, statós, dotós&quot; &quot;put, stood, given&quot; as analogical. Most scholars nowadays probably take them as original, but in the case of &quot;wind&quot; and &quot;plow&quot;, the argument cannot even come up.

Regarding Greek &quot;híeros&quot;, the pseudo-participle affix *-&quot;ro&quot;- is added directly to the verb root, so - &gt; *&quot;isero&quot;- &gt; *&quot;ihero&quot;- &gt; &quot;híeros&quot; (with regular throwback of the aspiration to the beginning of the word), and Sanskrit . There seems to be no question of the existence of a root *&quot;eysH&quot;- &quot;vigorously move/cause to move&quot;. If the word began with a laryngeal, and most scholars would agree that it did, it would have to be , specifically; and that is a problem. A root of the shape is not possible. Indo-European had no roots of the type , , , i.e., with two copies of the same consonant. But Greek attests an earlier (and rather more widely attested) form of the same meaning, &quot;híaros&quot;. If we reconstruct , all of our problems are solved in one stroke. The explanation for the &quot;híeros/híaros&quot; business has long been discussed, without much result; laryngeal theory now provides the opportunity for an explanation which did not exist before, namely the metathesis of the two laryngeals. It is still only a guess, but it is a much simpler and more elegant guess than the guesses available before.

The syllabic *&quot;&quot; in &quot;father&quot; might not be isolated. Certain evidence shows that the kinship affix seen in &quot;mother, father&quot; etc. might have been instead of . The laryngeal syllabified after a consonant (thus Greek &quot;patḗr&quot;, Latin , Sanskrit ; Greek &quot;thugátēr&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;daughter&quot;) but lengthened a preceding vowel (thus say Latin &quot;māter&quot; &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;frāter&quot; &quot;brother&quot;) — even when the &quot;vowel&quot; in question was a syllabic resonant, as in Sanskrit &quot;husbands&#x27; wives&quot; &lt; - &lt; -).

==Laryngeals in morphology==

Like any other consonant, laryngeals feature in the endings of verbs and nouns and derivational morphology, the only difference being the greater difficulty of telling what&#x27;s going on. Indo-Iranian, for example, can retain forms that pretty clearly reflect a laryngeal, but there is no way of knowing which one.

The following is a rundown of laryngeals in Proto-Indo-European morphology.

* is seen in the instrumental ending (probably originally indifferent to number, like English expressions of the type &quot;by hand&quot; and &quot;on foot&quot;). In Sanskrit, feminine &quot;i&quot;- and &quot;u&quot;-stems have instrumentals in -&quot;ī, -ū&quot;, respectively. In the Rigveda, there are a few old &quot;a&quot;-stems (PIE &quot;o&quot;-stems) with an instrumental in -&quot;ā;&quot; but even in that oldest text the usual ending is -, from the &quot;n&quot;-stems.
::Greek has some adverbs in -&quot;ē&quot;, but more important are the Mycenaean forms like &quot;e-re-pa-te&quot; &quot;with ivory&quot; (i.e. &quot;elephantē? -ě?&quot;)

::The marker of the neuter dual was *-&quot;iH&quot;, as in Sanskrit &quot;bharatī&quot; &quot;two carrying ones (neut.)&quot;, &quot;nāmanī&quot; &quot;two names&quot;, &quot;yuge&quot; &quot;two yokes&quot; (&lt;&quot; yuga-i&quot;? *&quot;yuga-ī&quot;?). Greek to the rescue: the Homeric form &quot;ósse&quot; &quot;the (two) eyes&quot; is manifestly from *&quot;h₃ekʷ-ih₁&quot; (formerly *&quot;okʷ-ī&quot;) via fully regular sound laws (intermediately *&quot;okʷye&quot;).

::&quot;*-eh₁&quot;- derives stative verb senses from eventive roots: PIE &quot;sit (down)&quot;: *&quot;sed-eh₁&quot;- &quot;be in a sitting position&quot; (&gt; Proto-Italic *&quot;sed-ē-ye-mos&quot; &quot;we are sitting&quot; &gt; Latin ). It is attested in Celtic, Italic, Germanic (the Class IV weak verbs), and Baltic/Slavic, with some traces in Indo-Iranian (In Avestan the affix seems to form past-habitual stems).

::It seems likely, though it is less certain, that this same underlies the nominative-accusative dual in &quot;o&quot;-stems: Sanskrit &quot;vṛkā&quot;, Greek &quot;lúkō&quot; &quot;two wolves&quot;. (The alternative ending -&quot;āu&quot; in Sanskrit cuts a small figure in the Rigveda, but eventually becomes the standard form of the &quot;o&quot;-stem dual.)

:: derives desiderative stems as in Sanskrit &quot;jighāṃsati&quot; &quot;desires to slay&quot; &lt; (root , Sanskrit &quot;han&quot;- &quot;slay&quot;). This is the source of Greek future tense formations and (with the addition of a thematic suffix *-&quot;ye/o&quot;-) the Indo-Iranian one as well: &quot;bhariṣyati&quot; &quot;will carry&quot; &lt; .

::&quot;*-yeh₁-/*-ih₁&quot;- is the optative suffix for root verb inflections, e.g. Latin (old) &quot;siet&quot; &quot;may he be&quot;, &quot;sīmus&quot; &quot;may we be&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;syāt&quot; &quot;may he be&quot;, and so on.

* is seen as the marker of the neuter plural: *&quot;-h₂&quot; in the consonant stems, *-&quot;eh₂&quot; in the vowel stems. Much levelling and remodelling are seen in the daughter languages that preserve any ending at all, thus Latin has generalized *-&quot;ā&quot; throughout the noun system (later regularly shortened to -&quot;a&quot;), Greek generalized -&quot;ǎ&quot; &lt; .

::The categories masculine/feminine plainly did not exist in the most original form of Proto-Indo-European, and there are very few noun types which are formally different in the two genders. The formal differences are mostly to be seen in adjectives (and not all of them) and pronouns. Both types of derived feminine stems feature : a type that is patently derived from the &quot;o&quot;-stem nominals; and an ablauting type showing alternations between and . Both are peculiar in having no actual marker for the nominative singular, and at least as far as the *-&quot;eh₂&quot;- type, two features seem clear: it is based on the &quot;o&quot;-stems, and the nom.sg. is probably in origin a neuter plural. (An archaic trait of Indo-European morpho-syntax is that plural neuter nouns construe with &quot;singular&quot; verbs, and quite possibly *&quot;yugeh₂&quot; was not so much &quot;yokes&quot; in our sense, but &quot;yokage; a harnessing-up&quot;.) Once that much is thought of, however, it is not easy to pin down the details of the &quot;&quot;ā&quot;-stems&quot; in the Indo-European languages outside of Anatolia, and such an analysis sheds no light at all on the / stems, which (like the -stems) form feminine adjective stems and derived nouns (e.g. Sanskrit &quot;devī&quot;- &quot;goddess&quot; from &quot;deva&quot;- &quot;god&quot;) but unlike the &quot;&quot;ā&quot;-stems&quot; have no foundation in any neuter category.

:: seems to have formed factitive verbs, as in &quot;to renew, make new again&quot;, as seen in Latin &quot;novāre&quot;, Greek &quot;neáō&quot; and Hittite &quot;ne-wa-aḫ-ḫa-an-t-&quot; (participle) all &quot;renew&quot; but all three with the pregnant sense of &quot;plow anew; return fallow land to cultivation&quot;.

:: marked the 1st person singular, with a confusing distribution: in the thematic active (the familiar -&quot;ō&quot; ending of Greek and Latin, and Indo-Iranian -&quot;ā(mi))&quot;, and also in the perfect tense (not really a tense in PIE): as in Greek &quot;oîda&quot; &quot;I know&quot; &lt; . It is the basis of the Hittite ending , as in &quot;I take&quot; &lt; (original embellished with the primary tense marker with subsequent smoothing of the diphthong).

* may be tentatively identified in a directive case. No such case is found in Indo-European noun paradigms, but such a construct accounts for a curious collection of Hittite forms like &quot;(in)to the sky&quot;, &quot;to, into the ground&quot;, &quot;to the sea&quot;. These are sometimes explained as &quot;o&quot;-stem datives in -&quot;a&quot; &lt; *-&quot;ōy&quot;, an ending attested in Greek and Indo-Iranian, among others, but there are serious problems with such a view, and the forms are highly coherent, functionally. And there are also appropriate adverbs in Greek and Latin (elements lost in productive paradigms sometimes survive in stray forms, like the old instrumental case of the definite article in English expressions like &quot;the more the merrier&quot;): Greek &quot;ánō&quot; &quot;upwards, &quot;kátō&quot; &quot;downwards&quot;, Latin &quot;whither?&quot;, &quot;to that place&quot;; and perhaps even the Indic preposition/preverb &quot;â&quot; &quot;to(ward)&quot; which has no satisfactory competing etymology. (These forms must be distinguished from the similar-looking ones formed to the ablative in *-&quot;ōd&quot; and with a distinctive &quot;fromness&quot; sense: Greek &quot;ópō&quot; &quot;whence, from where&quot;.)

==Criticism==
Throughout its history, the laryngeal theory in its various forms has been subject to extensive criticism and revision.

The original argument of Saussure was not accepted by anyone in the Neogrammarian school, primarily based at the University of Leipzig, then reigning at the cutting-edge of Indo-European linguistics. Several of them attacked the &quot;Mémoire&quot; savagely. Hermann Osthoff&#x27;s criticism was particularly virulent, often descending into personal invective.

For the first half-century of its existence, the laryngeal theory was widely seen as &quot;an eccentric fancy of outsiders&quot;. In Germany, it was roundly rejected. Among its early proponents were Hermann Möller, who extended Saussure&#x27;s system with a third, non-colouring laryngeal, Albert Cuny, Holger Pedersen, and . The fact that these scholars were engaged in highly speculative long-range linguistic comparison further contributed to its isolation.

Although the founding fathers were able to provide some indirect evidence of a lost consonantal element (for example, the origin of the Indo-Iranian voiceless aspirates in *CH sequences and the ablaut pattern of the heavy bases, *CeRə- ~ *CR̥̄- in the traditional formulation), the direct evidence so crucial for the Neogrammarian thinking was lacking. Saussure&#x27;s structural considerations were foreign to the leading contemporary linguists.

After Jerzy Kuryłowicz&#x27;s convincing demonstration that the Hittite language preserved at least some of Saussure&#x27;s , the focus of the debate shifted. It was still unclear how many laryngeals are to be posited to account for the new facts and what effect they have had exactly. Kuryłowicz, after a while, settled on four laryngeals, an approach further accepted by Edward Sapir, Edgar Sturtevant, and – through them – much of American linguistics. The three-laryngeal system was defended, among others, by Walter Couvreur and by Émile Benveniste. Many individual proposals were made, which assumed up to ten laryngeals, such as that of André Martinet. While some scholars, like and Giuliano Bonfante, attempted to disregard Anatolian evidence altogether, the &quot;minimal&quot; serious proposal (with roots in Pedersen&#x27;s early ideas) was put forward by Hans Hendriksen, , and later Ladislav Zgusta, who assumed a single /H/ phoneme with no vowel-colouring effects.

However, by the 2000s a widespread agreement was reached in the field – though not unanimous – on reconstructing Möller&#x27;s three laryngeals. One of the last major critics of this approach was Oswald Szemerényi, who subscribed to a theory similar to Zgusta&#x27;s.

Today, the laryngeal theory is almost universally accepted in this new standard form. Nevertheless, marginal attempts to undermine its bases are occasionally undertaken.

<text>The was a short civil war fought in order to resolve a dispute about Japanese Imperial succession. The dispute was also about the degree of control exercised by the Fujiwara clan who had become hereditary Imperial regents during the Heian period.

&quot;Hōgen no ran&quot; produced a series of unanticipated consequences. It created a foundation from which the dominance of the samurai clans would come to be established. It is considered the beginning in a chain of events which would produce the first of three samurai-led governments in the history of Japan.

==Context==
A simmering power struggle in the Imperial court was focused on three figures in 1155. After the former Emperor Toba and the former Emperor Sutoku abdicated, each intended to continue to wield various kinds of power behind the throne during the reign of Emperor Konoe in cloistered rule. However, when young Konoe died, the dynamics of the contending factions changed.

* August 23, 1155 (&quot;Kyūju 2, 24th day of the 7th month&quot;) : In the 14th year of Konoe&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (近衛天皇14年), the emperor died; and despite an ensuing dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by a younger brother, the 4th son of former-Emperor Toba. Shortly after that, Emperor Go-Shirakawa is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

When Go-Shirakawa ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne, a new phase of this multi-faceted power struggle began to unfold. A bitter dispute between two of Toba&#x27;s sons was paralleled by divisions within the several &quot;kuge&quot; families and others. Toba had forced one of his sons to abdicate in favor of the son of another consort; and after 1142, former Emperor Sutoku harbored the expectation that his son would follow Emperor Konoe on the throne. Sutoku&#x27;s hopes were frustrated by the elevation of another brother who would become known as Go-Shirakawa.

* July 20, 1156 (&quot;Hōgen 1, 2nd day of the 7th month&quot;): The former-Emperor Toba died at the age of 54.

After the death of the Toba, forces loyal to reigning Emperor Go-Shirakawa and the forces supporting retired former Emperor Sutoku disputed the accession of Go-Shirakawa and his continued possession of the throne. The opposing groups were also contending over continuation of cloistered government.

==Battle==
Go-Shirakawa and Sutoku were rival sons of Toba. Fujiwara no Tadamichi, first son of regent Fujiwara no Tadazane, sided with Go-Shirakawa while his younger brother Fujiwara no Yorinaga sided with Sutoku. Each rival side in turn beckoned the Minamoto and Taira clans of samurai. Minamoto no Tameyoshi, head of the Minamoto clan, and Taira no Tadamasa, head of the Taira contingent, sided with Sutoku and Yorinaga. Minamoto no Yoshitomo, first son of Minamoto no Tameyoshi, and Taira no Kiyomori, head of the Taira clan and nephew of Taira no Tadamasa, sided with Go-Shirakawa and Tadamichi.

* July 28, 1156 (&quot;Hōgen 1, 10th day of the 7th month&quot;): Both forces faced each other in Kyōto. On the Sutoku side, Minamoto no Tametomo (son of Minamoto no Tameyoshi and younger brother of Yoshitomo) suggested a night attack on an enemy palace, but Fujiwara no Yorinaga rejected this strategy. Meanwhile, their enemy Minamoto no Yoshitomo suggested the same, and followed through on it.
* July 29, 1156 (&quot;Hōgen 1, 11th day of the 7th month&quot;): At night, Kiyomori and Yoshitomo led 600 cavalry and attacked Sutoku in the Siege of Shirakawa-den. Kiyomori attacked the West gate where Tametomo defended it. Tametomo repulsed Kiyomori&#x27;s force with his outstanding archery units.

Then Yoshitomo attacked Tametomo but he was also repulsed. Sutoku&#x27;s samurai fought hard, and a fierce battle continued. Yoshitomo suggested that they set the enemy palace on fire. This was done and, fighting both the flames and Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s forces, Sutoku&#x27;s samurai fled, leaving Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s allies victorious on the battlefield.

==Outcome==
The forces of the reigning Emperor Go-Shirakawa went on to defeat the forces of the former Emperor Sutoku. This made way for Go-Shirakawa to abdicate while still continuing to exercise unfettered Imperial powers. Go-Shirakawa became the new cloistered emperor in 1158, and he would continue to exercise power throughout the reigns of five emperors: Emperor Nijō, Emperor Rokujō, Emperor Takakura, Emperor Antoku, and Emperor Go-Toba. His influence only ceased with his death in 1192. Sutoku was banished to Sanuki Province of Shikoku; Fujiwara no Yorinaga was killed in battle, and Minamoto no Tameyoshi and Taira no Tadamasa were executed. Tametomo survived the battle and was forced to flee.

Minamoto no Yoshitomo became head of his clan after the death of his father and together with Taira no Kiyomori, succeeded in establishing the two samurai clans as major new political powers in Kyoto.

===Legacy===
The outcome of the Hōgen Rebellion and the rivalry established between the Minamoto and Taira clans led to the Heiji Rebellion in 1159.

The Kamakura period epic &quot;Tale of the Disturbance in Hōgen&quot; is about the exploits of the samurai who participated in the Hōgen Rebellion. Together with the &quot;Tale of the Disturbance in Heiji&quot; and the &quot;Tale of Heike&quot;, these war stories (&quot;gunki monogatari&quot;) describe the rise and fall of the Minamoto and Taira samurai clans.

<doc id="189384" wikidata="Q553449" url="?curid=189384" title="Thomas Sowell">
<text>Thomas Sowell ( ; born June 30, 1930) is an American economist, economic historian, social philosopher and political commentator. He is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. With widely published commentary and books—and as a guest on TV and radio—he is a well-known voice in the American conservative movement as a prominent black conservative. He was a recipient of the National Humanities Medal from President George W. Bush in 2002.

Sowell was born in Gastonia, North Carolina, and grew up in Harlem, New York City. Due to poverty and difficulties at home, he dropped out of Stuyvesant High School and worked various odd jobs, eventually serving in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War. Afterward, he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard University in 1958. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in economics from Columbia University the next year and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1968. In his academic career, he held professorships at Cornell University, Brandeis University and the University of California, Los Angeles. He has also worked at think tanks including the Urban Institute. Since 1977, he has worked at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he is the Rose and Milton Friedman Senior Fellow on Public Policy.

Sowell was an important figure to the conservative movement during the Reagan era, influencing fellow economist Walter E. Williams and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. He was offered a position as Federal Trade Commissioner in the Ford administration and was considered for posts including U.S. Secretary of Education in the Reagan administration, but declined both times.

Sowell is the author of more than 45 books (including revised and new editions) on a variety of subjects including politics, economics, education and race and he has been a syndicated columnist in more than 150 newspapers. His views are described as conservative, especially on social issues; libertarian, especially on economics; or libertarian-conservative. He has said he may be best labeled as a libertarian, though he disagrees with the &quot;libertarian movement&quot; on some issues, such as national defense.

== Early life ==
Sowell was born in 1930 into a poor family in segregated Gastonia, North Carolina. His father died shortly before he was born, leaving behind Sowell&#x27;s mother, a housemaid who already had four children. A great-aunt and her two grown daughters adopted Sowell and raised him. His mother died a few years later of complications while giving birth to another child. In his autobiography, &quot;A Personal Odyssey,&quot; Sowell wrote that his childhood encounters with white people were so limited that he did not know blond was a hair color. He recalls that his first memories were living in a small wooden house in Charlotte, North Carolina, which he stated was typical of most black neighborhoods. It was located on an unpaved street and had no electricity or running water. When Sowell was nine years old, he and his extended family moved from North Carolina to Harlem, New York City, for greater opportunities, joining in the large-scale trend of African-American migration from the American south to the north. Family quarrels forced him and his aunt to room in other people&#x27;s apartments.

Sowell qualified for Stuyvesant High School, a prestigious academic high school in New York City; he was the first in his family to study beyond the sixth grade. However, he was forced to drop out at age 17 because of financial difficulties and family quarreling. He worked a number of odd jobs, including long hours at a machine shop, and as a delivery man for Western Union. He also tried out for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1948. Sowell was drafted into the armed services in 1951 during the Korean War and was assigned to the U.S. Marine Corps. Although Sowell opposed the war and experienced racism, he was able to find fulfillment as a photographer, which eventually became his favorite hobby. He was honorably discharged in 1952.

=== Higher education and early career ===
After leaving military service, Sowell completed high school, took a civil service job in Washington, DC, and attended night classes at Howard University, a historically black college. His high scores on the College Board exams and recommendations by two professors helped him gain admission to Harvard University, where he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. He earned a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University the following year. Sowell had initially chosen Columbia University to study under George Stigler, who would later receive the Nobel Prize in Economics, but when he learned that Stigler had moved to the University of Chicago, he followed him there and studied for his doctorate under Stigler upon arriving in the fall of 1959.

Sowell has said that he was a Marxist &quot;during the decade of my 20s&quot;. One of his earliest professional publications was a sympathetic examination of Marxist thought vs. Marxist–Leninist practice. What began to change his mind toward supporting free market economics, he said, was studying the possible impact of minimum wages on unemployment of sugar industry workers in Puerto Rico, as a U.S. Department of Labor intern. Workers at the department were surprised by his questioning, he said, and he concluded that &quot;they certainly weren&#x27;t going to engage in any scrutiny of the law&quot;.

Sowell received his Doctor of Philosophy in economics from the University of Chicago in 1968. His dissertation was titled &quot;Say&#x27;s Law and the General Glut Controversy&quot;.

== Academic career ==
From 1965 to 1969, Sowell was an assistant professor of economics at Cornell University. Writing 30 years later about the 1969 seizure of Willard Straight Hall by black students at Cornell, Sowell characterized the students as &quot;hoodlums&quot; with &quot;serious academic problems [who were] admitted under lower academic standards&quot;, and noted &quot;it so happens that the pervasive racism that black students supposedly encountered at every turn on campus and in town was not apparent to me during the four years that I taught at Cornell and lived in Ithaca.&quot;

Sowell has taught economics at Howard University, Rutgers, Cornell, Brandeis University, Amherst College, and the University of California, Los Angeles. At Howard, Sowell wrote, he was offered the position as head of the economics department, but he declined. Since 1980, he has been a Senior Fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he holds a fellowship named after Rose and Milton Friedman, his mentor. The Hoover appointment, because it did not involve teaching, gave him more time for his numerous writings. In addition, Sowell appeared several times on William F. Buckley Jr.&#x27;s show &quot;Firing Line&quot;, during which he discussed the economics of race and privatization. Sowell has written that he gradually lost faith in the academic system, citing low academic standards and counterproductive university bureaucracy, and he resolved to leave teaching after his time at the University of California, Los Angeles. In &quot;A Personal Odyssey&quot;, he recounts, &quot;I had come to Amherst, basically, to find reasons to continue teaching. What I found instead were more reasons to abandon an academic career.&quot;

In an interview, Sowell said he had been offered a position as Federal Trade Commissioner by the Ford administration in 1976, but that after pursuing the opportunity, he withdrew from consideration to avoid the political games surrounding the position. He said in another interview that he was offered the post of United States Secretary of Education but declined. In 1980, after Reagan&#x27;s election, Sowell and Henry Lucas organized the Black Alternatives Conference to bring together black and white conservatives; one attendee was a young Clarence Thomas, then a congressional aide. Sowell was appointed as a member of the Economic Policy Advisory Committee of the Reagan administration, but resigned after the first meeting, disliking travel from the West Coast and lengthy discussions in Washington; of his decision to resign, Sowell cited &quot;the opinion (and the example) of Milton Friedman, that some individuals can contribute more by staying out of government&quot;.

In 1987, Sowell testified in favor of federal appeals court judge Robert Bork during the hearings for Bork&#x27;s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. In his testimony, Sowell said that Bork was &quot;the most highly qualified nominee of this generation&quot; and that what he viewed as judicial activism, a concept that Bork opposed as a self-described originalist and textualist, &quot;has not been beneficial to minorities.&quot;

In a review of Sowell&#x27;s 1987 book, &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot;, Larry D. Nachman in &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine described Sowell as a leading representative of the Chicago school of economics.

== Writings and thought ==
Themes of Sowell&#x27;s writing range from social policy on race, ethnic groups, education, and decision-making, to classical and Marxian economics, to the problems of children perceived as having disabilities.

Sowell had a nationally syndicated column distributed by Creators Syndicate that was published in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Post&quot;, and other major newspapers, as well as online on websites such as &quot;RealClearPolitics&quot;, &quot;Townhall&quot;, &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot;, and the &quot;Jewish World Review&quot;. Sowell commented on current issues, which include liberal media bias; judicial activism and originalism; abortion; minimum wage; universal health care; the tension between government policies, programs, and protections and familial autonomy; affirmative action; government bureaucracy; gun control; militancy in U.S. foreign policy; the war on drugs; multiculturalism; mob rule; and the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. According to &quot;The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education&quot;, Sowell was the most cited black economist between 1991 and 1995, and second most cited between 1971 and 1990.

He was a frequent guest on &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, in conversations with Walter E. Williams, who was a substitute host for Limbaugh.

On December 27, 2016, Sowell announced the end of his syndicated column, writing that, at age 86, &quot;the question is not why I am quitting, but why I kept at it so long&quot;, and cited a desire to focus on his photography hobby.

The TV show &quot;Free to Choose,&quot; distributed by the Free to Choose Network, features Sowell along with Milton Friedman and a number of other panelists as they discuss the relationship between freedom and individual economic choices. A documentary detailing his career entitled &quot;Thomas Sowell: Common Sense in a Senseless World&quot; was released by the Free to Choose Network in 2021.

=== Economic and political ideology ===
Until the spring of 1972, Sowell was a registered Democrat, after which he then left the Democratic Party and resolved not to associate with any political party again, stating &quot;I was so disgusted with both candidates that I didn&#x27;t vote at all.&quot; Though he is often described as a black conservative, Sowell said, &quot;I prefer not to have labels, but I suspect that &#x27;libertarian&#x27; would suit me better than many others, although I disagree with the libertarian movement on a number of things.&quot; He has been described as one of the most prominent advocates of contemporary classical liberalism along with Friedrich Hayek and Larry Arnhart. Sowell primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism. Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation. Sowell described his study of Karl Marx in his autobiography; as a former Marxist who early in his career became disillusioned with it, he emphatically opposes Marxism, providing a critique in his book &quot;Marxism: Philosophy and Economics&quot; (1985).

Sowell has also written a trilogy of books on ideologies and political positions, including &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot;, in which he speaks on the origins of political strife; &quot;The Vision of the Anointed&quot;, in which he compares the conservative/libertarian and liberal/progressive worldviews; and &quot;The Quest for Cosmic Justice&quot;, in which, as in many of his other writings, he outlines his thesis of the need felt by intellectuals, politicians, and leaders to fix and perfect the world in utopian and ultimately, he posits, disastrous fashions. Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote &quot;Intellectuals and Society&quot;, building on his earlier work, in which he discusses what he argues to be the blind hubris and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas.

His book &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a &quot;landmark work&quot;, selected for this prize &quot;because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government&quot;. In announcing the award, the centre acclaimed Sowell, whose &quot;contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.&quot; Friedrich Hayek wrote: &quot;In a wholly original manner [Sowell] succeeds in translating abstract and theoretical argument into highly concrete and realistic discussion of the central problems of contemporary economic policy.&quot;

Sowell opposes the imposition of minimum wages by governments, arguing in his book &quot;Basic Economics&quot; that &quot;Unfortunately, the real minimum wage is always zero, regardless of the laws, and that is the wage that many workers receive in the wake of the creation or escalation of a government-mandated minimum wage, because they either lose their jobs or fail to find jobs when they enter the labor force.&quot; He goes further to argue that minimum wages disproportionately affect &quot;members of racial or ethnic minority groups&quot; that have been discriminated against. He asserts that &quot;Before federal minimum wage laws were instituted in the 1930s, the black unemployment rate was slightly lower than the white unemployment rate in 1930. But then followed the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933 and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938 – all of which imposed government-mandated minimum wages, either on a particular sector or more broadly... By 1954, black unemployment rates were double those of whites and have continued to be at that level or higher. Those particularly hard hit by the resulting unemployment have been black teenage males.&quot;

Sowell also favors decriminalization of all drugs. He opposes gun control laws, arguing, &quot;On net balance, they do not save lives, but cost lives.&quot;

=== Race and ethnicity ===
Sowell has supported conservative political positions on race, and is known for caustic, sarcastic criticism of liberal black civil rights figures. Sowell has argued that systemic racism is an untested, questionable hypothesis, writing, &quot;I don&#x27;t think even the people who use it have any clear idea what they&#x27;re saying&quot;, and compared it to propaganda tactics used by Joseph Goebbels because if it is &quot;repeated long enough and loud enough&quot;, people &quot;cave in&quot; to it.

In several of his works—including &quot;The Economics and Politics of Race&quot; (1983), &quot;Ethnic America&quot; (1981), &quot;Affirmative Action Around the World&quot; (2004), and other books—Sowell challenges the notion that black progress is due to progressive government programs or policies. He claims that many problems identified with black people in modern society are not unique, neither in terms of American ethnic groups, nor in terms of a rural proletariat struggling with disruption as it became urbanized, as discussed in his &quot;Black Rednecks and White Liberals&quot; (2005). He is critical of affirmative action and race-based quotas.
He takes issue with the notion of government as a helper or savior of minorities, arguing that the historical record shows the opposite. In &quot;Affirmative Action Around the World&quot;, Sowell holds that affirmative action affects more groups than is commonly understood, though its impacts occur through different mechanisms, and has long since ceased to favor blacks.

In &quot;Intellectuals and Race&quot; (2013), Sowell argues that intelligence quotient (IQ) gaps are hardly startling or unusual between, or within, ethnic groups. He notes that the roughly 15-point gap in contemporary black–white IQ scores is similar to that between the national average and the scores of certain ethnic white groups in years past, in periods when the nation was absorbing new immigrants.

=== Late-talking and the Einstein syndrome ===
Sowell&#x27;s book &quot;The Einstein Syndrome: Bright Children Who Talk Late&quot; was published in 2021 as a follow-up to his &quot;Late-Talking Children&quot;. In it, Sowell discusses what he calls the &quot;Einstein syndrome&quot;, which refers to the phenomenon of late-talking children. Sowell says these children are frequently misdiagnosed with autism or pervasive developmental disorder. He includes the research of Stephen Camarata and Steven Pinker, among others. Sowell says this trait affected many historical figures who developed prominent careers, such as physicists Albert Einstein, Edward Teller, and Richard Feynman; mathematician Julia Robinson; and musicians Arthur Rubinstein and Clara Schumann. According to Sowell, some children develop unevenly (asynchronous development) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the brain. This may temporarily &quot;rob resources&quot; from neighboring functions such as language development.

=== Politics ===
In a 2009 column titled &quot;The Bush Legacy&quot;, Sowell assessed President George W. Bush as &quot;a mixed bag&quot; but &quot;an honorable man.&quot;

Sowell said the media was &quot;filtering and spinning&quot; its coverage regarding abortions and has spoken out against sex-selective abortion. In 2018, he named George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ronald Reagan, and Calvin Coolidge as presidents he liked.

==== Donald Trump ====
Sowell was strongly critical of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and grudgingly endorsed Ted Cruz in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, criticizing him as well, stating that &quot;we can only make our choices among those actually available&quot;. During the 2016 Republican primary, Sowell criticized Trump, questioning whether Trump had &quot;any principles at all, other than promoting Donald Trump?&quot; Two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Sowell recommended voting for Trump over Hillary Clinton, because he would be &quot;easier to impeach&quot;. In 2018, when asked on his thoughts of Trump&#x27;s presidency, Sowell replied, &quot;I think he&#x27;s better than the previous president.&quot;

During interviews in 2019, Sowell defended Trump against charges of racism.

==== Joe Biden presidential nomination ====
In 2020, Sowell wrote that if the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, it could signal a point of no return for the United States, a tipping point akin to the fall of the Roman Empire. In an interview in July 2020, he stated that &quot;the Roman Empire overcame many problems in its long history but eventually it reached a point where it could no longer continue, and much of that was from within, not just the barbarians attacking from outside.&quot; Sowell wrote that if Biden became president, the Democratic Party would have an enormous amount of control over the nation, and if this happened, they could twin with the &quot;radical left&quot; and ideas such as defunding the police could come to fruition.

=== Education ===
Sowell has written about education throughout his career. He has argued for the need for reform of the school system in the United States. In his book &quot;Charter Schools and Their Enemies&quot; (2020), Sowell compares the educational outcomes of school children educated at charter schools with those at conventional public schools. In his research, Sowell first explains the need and his methodology for choosing comparable students—both ethnically and socioeconomically—before listing his findings. He presents the case that charter schools on the whole do significantly better in terms of educational outcomes than conventional schools.

Sowell argues that many U.S. schools are failing children; contends that &quot;indoctrination&quot; has taken the place of proper education; and argues that teachers&#x27; unions have promoted harmful education policies. Sowell contends that many schools have become monopolies for educational bureaucracies.

In his book &quot;Education: Assumptions Versus History&quot; (1986), Sowell analyzes the state of education in U.S. schools and universities. In particular, he examines the experiences of blacks and other ethnic groups in the American education system and identifies the factors and patterns behind both success and failure.

== Reception ==
Classical liberals, libertarians, and other conservatives of different disciplines have received Sowell&#x27;s work positively. Among these, he has been noted for originality, depth and breadth, clarity of expression, and thoroughness of research. Sowell&#x27;s publications have been received positively by economists Steven Plaut, Steve H. Hanke James M. Buchanan; and John B. Taylor; philosophers Carl Cohen and Tibor Machan; science historian Michael Shermer; essayist Gerald Early; political scientists Abigail Thernstrom and Charles Murray; psychologists Steven Pinker and Jonathan Haidt; and Josef Joffe, publisher and editor of Steve Forbes, in a 2015 column, stated that &quot;it&#x27;s a scandal that economist Thomas Sowell has not been awarded the Nobel Prize. No one alive has turned out so many insightful, richly researched books.&quot;

Nathan J. Robinson stated that Sowell &quot;is not given much attention by mainstream scholars in the academy, and few of his books are reviewed by major liberal-leaning publications.&quot; He suggested this may be because &quot;[h]is books rarely engage with the major academic literature on the subject he&#x27;s writing about&quot; and he often &quot;leaves out crucial pieces of data that would make his position look weaker&quot;, citing his writing on minimum wage policy and unemployment as an example. Economist James B. Stewart wrote a critical review of &quot;Black Rednecks and White Liberals&quot;, calling it &quot;the latest salvo in Thomas Sowell&#x27;s continuing crusade to represent allegedly dysfunctional value orientations and behavioral characteristics of African Americans as the principal reasons for persistent economic and social disparities.&quot; He also criticized it for downplaying the impact of slavery. Particularly in black communities in the 1980s Sowell became, in historian Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s words, &quot;persona non grata, someone known to talk &quot;about&quot;, rather than with, African Americans&quot;. Economist Bernadette Chachere, law professor Richard Thompson Ford, and sociologists William Julius Wilson and Richard Coughlin have criticized some of his work.

Criticisms include neglecting discrimination against women in the workforce in &quot;Rhetoric or Reality?&quot;, the methodology of &quot;Race and Culture: A World View&quot;, and portrayal of opposing theories in &quot;Intellectuals and Race&quot;. Economist Jennifer Doleac criticized &quot;Discrimination and Disparities&quot;, arguing that statistical discrimination is real and pervasive (Sowell argues that existing racial disparities are mostly due to accurate sorting based on underlying characteristics, such as education) and that government intervention can achieve societal goals and make markets work more efficiently. Columnist Steven Pearlstein criticized &quot;Wealth, Poverty and Politics&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Sowell was married to Alma Jean Parr from 1964 to 1975, and married Mary Ash in 1981. He has two children.

<text>Quark is a fictional character in the American television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. He was played by Armin Shimerman and is a member of the extraterrestrial race known as the Ferengi, who are stereotypically capitalist and motivated only by profit.

== Depiction==

Quark was introduced on television in 1993, in the two-part &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; premiere &quot;Emissary&quot;.

Talking about his depiction of Quark, Shimerman said the character developed significantly during the start of the sixth season of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, during a story arc in which the Dominion took control of the Deep Space Nine station:

Max Grodénchik, who was cast as Quark&#x27;s brother Rom, originally auditioned for the role of Quark; he later said, &quot;I got to know Armin a bit during the audition process. He had so much more history with the show.&quot;

Karen Westerfield did the makeup for Quark during all of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.&quot; Shimerman said, “I always say that Karen helped create Quark as much as I did”. He also said of Westerfield, “It was her idea to put the maroon shading around my eyes. The makeup accented the eyes, so you could see the eyes better. The other Ferengi characters didn’t have that, and it made a huge difference.”

===Career===
Before opening a bar, known as &quot;Quark&#x27;s Bar, Grill, Gaming House and Holosuite Arcade&quot;, Quark served as a cook aboard a Ferengi freighter for eight years, according to the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Profit and Loss&quot;. According to his own admission, he was rising to the top of the Ferengi Business world as an assistant to the Grand Nagus until he made the mistake of making love to his boss’s sister which resulted in him becoming a cook. He came to the station while it was named Terok Nor during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. Originally, Quark admired the Cardassian race for their version of morality, but later he seemed to take pity on the downtrodden Bajoran people, selling them food and equipment just above cost, which could have gotten him into serious trouble if the Cardassians had found out. When the station changed hands at the end of the occupation, he decided to leave. Commander Sisko, feeling that Quark&#x27;s Bar (which offered holosuites and gambling) would encourage commercial tourism to boost the station&#x27;s economy, extorted Quark into staying, using Quark&#x27;s nephew Nog as a bargaining chip, in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; pilot episode, &quot;Emissary.&quot;

Quark engages in a variety of shady deals, but neither Sisko nor Odo, Quark&#x27;s nominal nemesis and head of station security, take serious action against him, partially because his value outweighs his numerous illegal activities, which for the most part harm no one. Furthermore, the station&#x27;s status as, technically, the property of Bajor and thus only nominally a Federation station, sometimes prevented Sisko from prosecuting Quark to the full extent of Federation law; Sisko was not allowed such latitude with criminals who were also Federation citizens, such as his own lover, Kasidy Yates, whom Sisko was once obliged to arrest for dealing in illicit replicators when, on the same occasion, he was obliged to allow Quark relative amnesty for dealing in illicit &quot;weapons&quot;. In the episode &quot;Business as Usual&quot;, Sisko admits that he had &quot;cut [Quark] a &quot;lot&quot; of slack in the past [and] even looked away once or twice when [he] could have come down hard.&quot; However, Sisko&#x27;s leniency does not stop Odo from regularly interfering with Quark&#x27;s illegal doings. A shrewd businessman, Quark often quotes the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition. In one episode, &quot;Civil Defense&quot;, when Quark and Odo are trapped in Odo&#x27;s office as Deep Space Nine is about to explode, Quark mourns the fact that despite a lifetime of plotting and faithfully following the Rules of Acquisition the only thing he owns is a bar; Odo tries to cheer Quark up by saying that although he has known of Ferengi who are richer than Quark, Quark is the most devious Ferengi Odo has ever met.

When the Bajoran wormhole is discovered, Quark helps broker deals between several Gamma Quadrant races and the Ferengi. The Alpha Quadrant&#x27;s first knowledge of the Dominion comes through his business dealings in the Gamma Quadrant with the Karemma of the Dominion. Quark becomes Grand Nagus for a brief period when it appears that Zek had died; however, Zek&#x27;s death turns out to be a ruse and Quark is promptly deposed. Along with Commander Sisko, Quark is also among the first to encounter the genetically engineered soldiers of the Dominion, the Jem&#x27;Hadar.

Quark repeatedly clashes with FCA (Ferengi Commerce Authority) liquidator Brunt, who believes that Quark is detrimental to Ferengi society and beliefs. The two meet initially in a scandal involving Quark&#x27;s mother Ishka, who had earned profit despite this being illegal for a female. Following this, Brunt is responsible for Quark receiving a savage beating at the hands of Nausicaan thugs. The attack is meant to coerce Quark into dissolving the employee union founded by his brother, Rom. Instead, Quark secretly honors many of the union&#x27;s demands. Later, when Quark is falsely diagnosed with a fatal disease, Brunt anonymously buys the Ferengi bartender&#x27;s remains six days in advance. When Quark discovers he is not dying and backs out of the contract, Brunt revokes Quark&#x27;s business license with glee, but Quark&#x27;s friends supply him with all the equipment necessary to continue operating his bar anyway. (Body Parts) (The license is later reinstated as part of a deal between Quark and Brunt to break up Zek and Ishka, who had begun a relationship.) When Brunt almost becomes Grand Nagus, Quark temporarily becomes a female named Lumba to convince FCA commissioner Nilva that allowing Ferengi females to wear clothing is an opportunity for profit. Brunt does not believe the charade for a minute, but Nilva is deceived and chases &quot;her&quot; amorously. After Quark is accidentally transported 400 years into the past to Roswell, New Mexico 1947 he dreams of altering the space-time continuum by the creation of a vast Ferengi economic Empire across the universe with himself in charge of it (&quot;Little Green Men&quot;). In a concluding episode of the series, &quot;The Dogs of War&quot;, Quark is horrified to learn from Brunt that the Grand Nagus has &quot;reformed&quot; Ferengi world with such &quot;innovations&quot; as prices of official bribes; taxes, social welfare and the institution of a &quot;Congress&quot; of 240 business partners.(In comic relief Both Quark and Brunt pray that Ferenginar turn back to unrestrained capitalism). Quark vows to return the Ferengi world back to unchecked exploitation of capitalism when he becomes Grand Nagus but is stunned when it is his brother Rom who becomes &quot;Grand Nagus&quot; instead. In the last episode of the series, Quark literally has the last line of the series when he remarks that the more things seem to change, the more they stay the same. (&quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;)

Quark, Rom and Nog do not understand or speak English/Federation Standard, but rather rely on Universal Translators implanted near their ears (&quot;Little Green Men&quot;).

===Family, friends, and romantic interests===

Quark loved his brother Rom, and occasionally even found him useful. Nonetheless, in true Ferengi fashion, he treated Rom with little respect and ordered him about like a servant. Quark was also fond of swindling Rom out of his share of the bar&#x27;s profits. They were partners in many other business ventures, although Quark routinely made sure to keep Rom in the dark about the true nature of their dealings. Quark&#x27;s nephew, Nog, also briefly worked in his uncle&#x27;s bar, before departing for Starfleet Academy. Rom eventually succeeded Zek as Grand Nagus, largely through the machinations of Ishka.

Quark&#x27;s relationship with his mother Ishka was tumultuous at best. She drove him to distraction with her untraditional ways. Ishka insisted upon wearing clothing and making profit. She was the financial mastermind in the family. However, Quark&#x27;s father Keldar refused to listen to her advice simply because she was female. Ishka reluctantly revealed to Quark that he was a lot like her, while Rom was more like his father. She became Zek&#x27;s lover and trusted advisor.

Throughout the series, Quark was often locked in a battle of wits with station security chief Odo, who regularly foiled Quark&#x27;s criminal schemes. The two eventually developed a grudging respect for each other. When Odo finally left the station to rejoin the Great Link at the end of the series, Quark came to say goodbye, and made a toast to Odo. Quark also had a firm friendship with Jadzia Dax, with whom he often played tongo. Although Quark presented himself as amoral and ruthless, he deeply cared for his friends. In &quot;Move Along Home&quot; when he was apparently forced to sacrifice one of four crew members (Sisko, Dax, Bashir and Kira) in a strange alien game, he refused to make a choice, begging for their lives.

Quark has a cousin, Gaila, who is an arms dealer and has become successful enough to buy his own moon. Gaila appears in two episodes, &quot;Business as Usual&quot; and &quot;The Magnificent Ferengi,&quot; portrayed by Josh Pais.

Quark has had his share of romances throughout the series. In the first season, he was involved with Vash, a corrupt archaeologist first introduced in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. He was married to (and divorced from) a Klingon (Grilka) in an incident that also garnered him considerable respect from the Klingon community for his bravery, when he exposed how her husband&#x27;s rival had tried to attack his House through business measures rather than a straightforward duel and then provoked said rival into trying to kill Quark in a duel when Quark was unarmed and had freely acknowledged that he would lose. He had a Cardassian love interest (Natima Lang), was shown on several occasions to be attracted to both Major Kira Nerys and Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax, and once tried to seduce a Vulcan member of the Maquis (although this may have been motivated by his own efforts to find out more about the group). He also had a platonic affair with Pel, a female Ferengi posing as a male in order to make profit.

In the non-canon novels set after the series, Quark starts a romantic relation with Ro Laren who has taken Odo&#x27;s place as head of security.

The Mirror Universe version of Quark appeared only once, in the episode &quot;Crossover&quot;. At first he appears much the same as his regular counterpart (although mirror Quark has no idea what &#x27;gold pressed latinum&#x27;, a staple of Ferengi currency, is), but it is soon revealed that mirror Quark is actively helping Terran slaves escape the cruelty of the Klingon/Cardassian Alliance. This version of Quark is eventually caught and executed when his activities are discovered.

==Guest appearances==
Armin Shimerman appeared as Quark in the 7th-season &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Firstborn&quot;, where in conversation it is clear Riker already knew him, and in the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; pilot episode &quot;Caretaker&quot;. He is referenced in the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; episode &quot;Stardust City Rag&quot; when a &quot;Quark&#x27;s Bar&quot; is seen on the planet &quot;Freecloud&quot; in the Alpha Doradus system. Shimerman voiced Quark on the animated series in a guest appearance on &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; Season 3 episode &quot;Hear All, Trust Nothing&quot;, where it is revealed that the Freecloud establishment is one of 21 franchised locations Quark has established across the Alpha Quadrant.

==Expanded Universe media==
Quark is featured in &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels published by Pocket Books. This includes books written by Shimerman.

==Reception==
In 2016, Screen Rant rated Quark as the 17th best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall, highlighting the character as a commentary on the human condition. In 2018, The Wrap ranked Quark as the 25th best main cast character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall, calling him a &quot;valuable ally to Sisko when the chips are down&quot;.

In her 1998 book &quot;The Soul of Popular Culture&quot;, Mary Lynn Kittelson noted that Quark allowed Star Trek writers to discuss controversial topics of money, profit and capitalism. M. Keith Booker in his 2018 book &quot;Star Trek: A Cultural History&quot; described Quark as &quot;Star Trek&#x27;s most important Ferengi character&quot;, &quot;major character of DS9&quot; who is also &quot;the first main Star Trek character not to be a crew member&quot;. He noted that Quark&#x27;s primary purpose in the show is comedic relief.

<doc id="189387" wikidata="Q944859" url="?curid=189387" title="Heiji rebellion">
<text>The was a short civil war between rival subjects of the cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa of Japan in 1160 fought in order to resolve a dispute about political power. It was preceded by the Hōgen Rebellion in 1156. &quot;Heiji no ran&quot; is seen as a direct outcome of the earlier armed dispute; but unlike &quot;Hōgen no ran,&quot; which was a dispute between Emperors in which members of the same clan fought on different sides, this was rather a struggle for power between two rival samurai clans. It is also seen as a precursor of a broader civil war.

==Context==
Following the Hōgen rebellion, in which retired Emperor Sutoku attempted to seize power and enthrone his son, Emperor Go-Shirakawa reigned for only three years before abdicating on September 5, 1158. (&quot;Hōgen 3, 11th day of the 8th month&quot;) Shortly thereafter, Emperor Nijō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

After Nijō was formally enthroned, the management of all affairs continued to rest entirely in the hands of Go-Shirakawa, as per the system of Cloistered Emperor (insei). Fujiwara no Nobuyori and Fujiwara no Michinori (Shinzei) emerged as leading and rival advisors in this period, with Shinzei in a pre-eminent role. Further, while both the Taira and the surviving elements of Minamoto had helped Go-Shirakawa retain power, the Minamoto felt that the Taira were more greatly favoured by the court, under Shinzei&#x27;s influence, and chafed at the ordered executions of those parts of the clan who were loyal to Sutoku (especially Minamoto no Tameyoshi).

In late 1159, Taira no Kiyomori, head of the Taira clan, left Kyōto with his family, on a personal pilgrimage. This left the ambitious Fujiwara no Nobuyori, with allies from the Minamoto clan, a perfect opportunity to effect an uprising.

* January 19 – February 5, 1160 (&quot;Heiji 1, 9th–26th day of the 12th month&quot;): The &quot;Heiji&quot; rebellion, also known as the &quot;Heiji&quot; disturbance or the &quot;Heiji&quot; insurrection or the &quot;Heiji&quot; war.

==Combat==
In an attack on Sanjō Palace, the residence of the retired Emperor, Nobuyori and his Minamoto allies abducted the former emperor Go-Shirakawa and set fire to the Palace. After a pursuit, this also resulted in Shinzei&#x27;s death.

Minamoto no Yoshitomo and Fujiwara no Nobuyori moved the abducted Go-Shirakawa to the Imperial palace with Emperor Nijo, placing both under house arrest. Nobuyori had himself declared imperial chancellor, and began to see his plans for political power fall into place.

However, Kiyomori was informed and made haste to return. The Minamoto did not plan well enough militarily, and were unprepared to defend the city against Kiyomori&#x27;s return. Upon his return, the Minamoto made no decisive moves and hesitated.

Kiyomori made some peace proposals to Nobuyori. However, this was a plot. While Nobuyori was careless, the Emperor Nijō and the former emperor Go-shirakawa escaped to Kiyomori&#x27;s side.

Kiyomori received an imperial grant from the emperor for attacking Yoshitomo and Nobuyori. Taira no Shigemori (the eldest son of Kiyomori) led 3,000 cavalry and attacked the Imperial Palace where Yoshitomo and Nobuyori were staying. Nobuyori ran away immediately, but Minamoto no Yoshihira (the eldest son of Yoshitomo) fought back and a fierce battle ensued. Yoshihira fought hard and chased Shigemori within the Imperial Palace.

The Taira force retreated and the Minamoto force left the Imperial Palace in pursuit. This was a feint by Kiyomori. A detached Taira force occupied the Imperial Palace. The Minamoto force was cut off from any way of retreat. The Minamoto force charged at Rokuhara at a base of Kiyomori&#x27;s. It became a fierce battle, but finally the Minamoto force fled in disorderly retreat.

==Outcome==
Ultimately, Taira no Kiyomori defeated Yoshitomo. Yoshitomo was eventually betrayed and killed by a retainer while escaping from Kyōto in Owari. Yoshitomo&#x27;s two sons, Minamoto no Tomonaga and Minamoto no Yoshihira were also casualties. However three of his other sons, Yoritomo (then only 13 years old, and future founding Shogun of the Kamakura Shogunate 25 years later), Noriyori and Yoshitsune were spared.

Afterwards, Taira no Kiyomori banished Yoshitomo&#x27;s son Minamoto no Yoritomo, seized Minamoto wealth and land, and eventually formed the first of four samurai-dominated governments during the feudal history of Japan.

===Legacy===
The Heiji rebellion further weakened Imperial authority, placing power in the hands of the Taira samurai clan. It led to outright enmity between the Minamoto and Taira. The combination of this enmity and Go-Shirakawa&#x27;s resentment of Taira power led to the Genpei War, ending with the decisive Taira defeat at the Battle of Dan-no-ura in 1185. 
The Kamakura period epic &quot;Tale of Heiji&quot; describes the exploits of the samurai who participated in the Heiji Rebellion. Together with the &quot;Tale of Hōgen&quot; and the &quot;Tale of Heike&quot;, these war stories (&quot;gunki monogatari&quot;) describe the rise and fall of the Minamoto and Taira samurai clans.

<text>Sam Youd (16 April 1922 – 3 February 2012) was a British writer best known for science fiction written under the name of John Christopher, including the novels &quot;The Death of Grass&quot;, &quot;The Possessors&quot;, and the young-adult novel series &quot;The Tripods&quot;. He won the Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize in 1971 and the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1976.

Youd also wrote under variations of his own name and under the pseudonyms Stanley Winchester, Hilary Ford, William Godfrey, William Vine, Peter Graaf, Peter Nichols, and Anthony Rye.

==Biography==
Sam Youd was born in Huyton, Lancashire (though Youd is an old Cheshire surname). Youd was educated at Peter Symonds&#x27; School in Winchester, Hampshire, then served in the Royal Corps of Signals from 1941 to 1946. A scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation made it possible for him to pursue a writing career, beginning with &quot;The Winter Swan&quot; (Dennis Dobson, 1949), published under the name Christopher Youd. He wrote science fiction short stories as John Christopher from 1951, and his first book under that name was &quot;The Twenty-Second Century&quot;, a collection of science fiction stories; a few of the stories included had first appeared in magazines under the name Sam Youd. His first science fiction novel, &quot;Year of the Comet&quot;, was published by Michael Joseph in 1955, also under the name John Christopher. His second novel under the Christopher pseudonym, &quot;The Death of Grass&quot; (Michael Joseph, 1956) was Youd&#x27;s first major success as a writer. It was published in the United States the following year as &quot;No Blade of Grass&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1957). An American magazine published &quot;Year of the Comet&quot; later that year and it was issued in 1959 as an Avon paperback entitled &quot;Planet in Peril&quot;. Youd continued to use the pen name John Christopher for the majority of his writing and all of his science fiction. &quot;The Death of Grass&quot; has been reissued many times, most recently in the Penguin Modern Classics (2009).

In 1966 Youd started writing science fiction for adolescents, using the name John Christopher in every case. The Tripods trilogy (1967–68), &quot;The Lotus Caves&quot; (1969), &quot;The Guardians&quot; (1970) and the &quot;Sword of the Spirits&quot; trilogy (1971–72) were all well received. He won the annual Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize for &quot;The Guardians&quot;. In 1976 he won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, youth fiction category, for the same novel in its German translation, &quot;Die Wächter&quot;.

In 1946 he married Joyce Fairbairn, with whom he had five children (one son and four daughters). He divorced in 1978, marrying Jessica Ball.

Youd lived for many years in Rye, East Sussex and died in Bath, Somerset, on 3 February 2012, of complications from bladder cancer.

==Film and television adaptations==

&quot;The Death of Grass&quot; was adapted as a film by Cornel Wilde under its American title, &quot;No Blade of Grass&quot; (1970). &quot;The Tripods&quot; was partially developed into a British TV series. &quot;Empty World&quot; was developed into a 1987 TV movie in Germany, &quot;Leere Welt&quot;. &quot;The Guardians&quot; was made into a 1986 TV series in Germany, &quot;Die Wächter&quot;. &quot;The Lotus Caves&quot; was in development in 2007 as a film from Walden Media, to have been directed by Rpin Suwannath. Later, in 2013, a TV pilot based loosely on &quot;The Lotus Caves&quot; was developed by Bryan Fuller and titled &quot;High Moon&quot;. The pilot did not get picked up as a series, but was released on SyFy and Netflix in 2014.

<text>USS &quot;Boise&quot; (CL-47) was a light cruiser of the in the United States Navy. The cruiser was named for Boise, the capital city of the state of Idaho. Commissioned in 1938, she saw extensive service during World War II, taking part in fighting in the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters. Following the war the ship was decommissioned in 1946 and lay idle until sold to Argentina in 1951. Renamed ARA &quot;Nueve de Julio&quot;, the ship remained in service with the Argentinian Navy until 1978, after which she was taken to Brownsville, Texas and scrapped in 1983.

==Construction and career==

===Commissioning and Interwar period===

&quot;Boise&quot; was launched on 3 December 1936 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, sponsored by Miss Salome Clark, the daughter of Governor Clark of Idaho. The ship commissioned on 12 August 1938 with Captain Benjamin Vaughan McCandlish in command.

In February 1939, following a shakedown cruise to Monrovia, Liberia and Cape Town, Union of South Africa, &quot;Boise&quot; joined Cruiser Division 9 (CruDiv 9), Battle Force, at San Pedro, California. Until November 1941, she operated alternately off the west coast and in Hawaiian waters. She then escorted a convoy to Manila, Philippine Islands, arriving on 4 December.

===World War II===
The outbreak of war on 8 December 1941 found &quot;Boise&quot; off Cebu Island. On 9 January 1942 Task Force 5 (TF 5) was in northern Australian waters. &quot;Boise&quot; with the task force commander, Rear Admiral Glassford aboard, departed Darwin that day with and destroyers , , , and escorting the Dutch ship that was transporting hastily re-stowed supplies, artillery and artillerymen of the Headquarters Battery, 26th Field Artillery Brigade and the 1st Battalion, 131st Field Artillery that had arrived with the Pensacola Convoy to Surabaya. She rejoined the other elements of TF 5 in the East Indies, but on 21 January 1942 she struck an uncharted shoal in Sape Strait and had to retire to Colombo, Ceylon; Bombay, India; and Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs, which in essence saved her from being destroyed with the rest of the Allied ships during the various battles around Java. Her repairs completed, she sailed on 22 June to escort a convoy to Auckland, New Zealand.

&quot;Boise&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor and was tasked to conduct a raiding cruise in Japanese waters in hopes of creating an impression, including generating radio traffic, of a striking force heading for Japan to draw attention away from preparations for Guadalcanal. &quot;Boise&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 27 July and was expected to begin this raid on the Japanese sampan patrol line guarding approaches to Honshu about east of Tokyo on 5 August. She completed the raid on 8 August. Two seaplanes that had to land on the water at sunset were lost, one being found by the Japanese with indications this caused apprehension of a strike force preparing to attack Japan.

In August, she escorted a convoy to Fiji and New Hebrides. From 14 to 18 September, she helped cover the landing of Marine reinforcements on Guadalcanal.

On the night of 11–12 October 1942, during the Battle of Cape Esperance, the task force of which &quot;Boise&quot; was part encountered a force of Japanese cruisers and destroyers to the west of Guadalcanal. In the engagement &quot;Boise&quot; was hit a number of times, twice by fire from a Japanese heavy cruiser from about range. One hit exploded upon impact on her armor causing little damage. The other penetrated under the waterline and exploded in the magazine located between number I and II turrets causing a powder fire and flooding, putting turrets I, II, and III out of action and causing a number of casualties including 107 killed.

Under the command of Captain &quot;Mike&quot; Moran, who was later awarded the Navy Cross for his leadership during the battle, &quot;Boise&quot; made her way to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she underwent repairs from 19 November 1942 to 20 March 1943. The gunfire damage was the first case available for complete Bureau of Ships analysis. It was discovered that one of the shells was of English manufacture.

&quot;Boise&quot; departed on 8 June for the Mediterranean, arriving at Algiers, Algeria on 21 June. From 10 July to 18 August, she acted as a cover and fire support ship for the Amphibious Battle of Gela during the Invasion of Sicily. In September, she took part in the Italian mainland landings at Taranto (9–10 September) and Salerno (12–19 September). She returned to New York on 15 November, and once again steamed to the South Pacific, arriving at Milne Bay, New Guinea on 31 December.

During January–September 1944, she took part in operations along the northern shore of New Guinea, including:
Madang-Alexishafen bombardment (25–26 January);
Humboldt Bay landings (22 April);
shelling the Wakde and Sawar Airfields to neutralize the danger of air attack on newly won Allied positions (29–30 April);
Battle of Wakde-Toem landings (15–25 May);
Battle of Biak landings (25 May – 10 June);
Battle of Noemfoor landings (1–2 July);
Battle of Sansapor landings (27 July – 31 August);
and the Battle of Morotai landings (1–30 September).
The cruiser then moved north, as the battle front advanced into the Philippines, taking part in:
Leyte invasion (20–24 October);
Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October);
Mindoro landings (12–17 December);
Leyte-Mindoro covering action (26–29 December);
Lingayen Gulf landings, with General Douglas MacArthur embarked (4–13 January 1945);
Luzon covering force (14–31 January);
Bataan-Corregidor occupation (13–17 February);
and Zamboanga landings (8–12 March).
She then moved to Borneo for the Tarakan landings (27 April – 3 May).

From 3–16 June, she carried General MacArthur on a tour of the Central and Southern Philippines and Brunei Bay, Borneo, and then returned to San Pedro, California, arriving on 7 July. There she remained, undergoing overhaul and training until October. She sailed on 3 October for the east coast, arriving at New York on 20 October. &quot;Boise&quot; remained there until decommissioned on 1 July 1946.

===Argentine Navy===

&quot;Boise&quot; was sold to Argentina on 11 January 1951, along with , where they were commissioned as (&quot;9 July&quot;, Argentina&#x27;s Independence Day) and (later renamed &quot;General Belgrano&quot;) respectively.

During her years as an Argentinian warship, she took part of the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot;, shelling oil depots and military facilities around the coastal city of Mar del Plata, on 19 September 1955. She was accidentally rammed by &quot;General Belgrano&quot; on exercises in 1956, which resulted in damage to both cruisers.

&quot;Nueve de Julio&quot; remained in service with the Argentine Navy until 1978, when she was decommissioned and towed to Brownsville, Texas.

==Awards==
&quot;Boise&quot; received 11 battle stars for her service in World War II.

<text>François Sébastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt (; 14 October 1733 – 21 July 1798), a Walloon, joined the army of the Habsburg monarchy and soon fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Later in his military career, he led Austrian troops in the war against Ottoman Turkey. During the French Revolutionary Wars he saw extensive fighting and rose to the rank of Field Marshal.

==Early career==
In the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) he distinguished himself, earning rapid promotion, and received the Military Order of Maria Theresa decoration. At the conclusion of the peace (Treaty of Hubertusburg, 15 February 1763), though still under thirty, he had already become an Oberst (colonel).

During the revolt in the Netherlands in 1787, Clerfayt, as a Walloon by birth, came under great pressure to abandon Emperor Joseph II. But he resisted all overtures, and in the following year went to fight in the Austro-Turkish War with the rank of Feldmarschal-Leutnant (lieutenant field marshal). In an independent command Clerfayt achieved great success, defeating the Turks at Mehadia and Calafat. On 10 November 1788, the emperor appointed him to the rank of &quot;Feldzeugmeister&quot;.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
In 1792, as one of the most distinguished of the emperor&#x27;s generals, he received the command of the Austrian contingent in army of the duke of Brunswick, and at La Croix-aux-Bois his corps inflicted a reverse on the troops of the French Revolution. In the Netherlands, he commanded the center at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November. He opened the campaign of 1793 with the victory of Aldenhoven and the relief of Maastricht, and on 18 March 1793 proved instrumental in causing the complete defeat of Charles Dumouriez at the Battle of Neerwinden. In October, however, his victorious career suffered a reverse at the Battle of Wattignies.
He participated in the Flanders Campaign against Charles Pichegru in 1794. Leading a flanking column from the north, he fought at the Battle of Tourcoing on 17–18 May. A French force under Dominique Vandamme slowed his progress until Joseph Souham defeated the Anglo-Austrian army on the southern part of the battlefield. Souham then turned against Clerfayt and compelled him to retreat to the northeast. In the course of the campaign. Clerfayt succeeded Prince Josias of Coburg in the supreme command, but he failed to make headway against the French, and had to recross the Rhine.

A Feldmarschall from 22 April 1795, he commanded on the middle Rhine against Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and this time the fortunes of war changed. Clerfayt beat Jourdan at Höchst and brilliantly relieved Mainz. But the Austrian Foreign Minister Johann Thugut did not approve Clerfayt&#x27;s action in concluding an armistice with the French, so the field marshal resigned his command and became a member of the Aulic Council in Vienna. He died in 1798.

Clerfaytgasse in Hernals, Vienna is named after him.

==Commentary==
A brave and skillful soldier, Clerfayt perhaps achieved more than any other Austrian commander (except the Archduke Charles of Austria) in the hopeless struggle of small dynastic armies against a French &quot;nation in arms&quot;.

<doc id="189395" wikidata="Q5601716" url="?curid=189395" title="Greedy reductionism">
<text>Greedy reductionism, identified by Daniel Dennett, in his 1995 book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dangerous Idea&quot;, is a kind of erroneous reductionism. Whereas &quot;good&quot; reductionism means explaining a thing in terms of what it reduces to (for example, its parts and their interactions), greedy reductionism occurs when &quot;in their eagerness for a bargain, in their zeal to explain too much too fast, scientists and philosophers ... underestimate the complexities, trying to skip whole layers or levels of theory in their rush to fasten everything securely and neatly to the foundation&quot;. Using the terminology of &quot;cranes&quot; (legitimate, mechanistic explanations) and &quot;skyhooks&quot; (essentially, fake—e.g. supernaturalistic—explanations) built up earlier in the chapter, Dennett recapitulates his initial definition of the term in the chapter summary on p. 83: &quot;Good reductionists suppose that all Design can be explained without skyhooks; greedy reductionists suppose it can all be explained without cranes.&quot;

==Examples==
A canonical example of greedy reductionism, labelled as such by Dennett himself, is the (radical) behaviorism of B. F. Skinner. It is often said of this school of thought (which dominated the field of psychology, at least in the Anglo-American world, for part of the twentieth century) that it denied the existence of mental states such as beliefs, although at least in Skinner&#x27;s original version it merely denied the theoretical utility (or necessity) of postulating such states in order to explain behavior. Notably, Skinner himself characterized his views as anti-reductionist: in &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot; and other works (e.g. &quot;About Behaviorism&quot; and chapter 19 of &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot;), he wrote that while mental and neurological states did exist, behavior could be explained without recourse to either. As Dennett says, &quot;Skinner proclaimed that &quot;one simple iteration&quot; of the fundamental Darwinian process—operant conditioning—could account for all mentality, all learning, not just in pigeons but in human beings. ... Skinner was a greedy reductionist, trying to explain &quot;all&quot; the design (and design power) in a single stroke&quot;.

In his earlier book &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;, Dennett argued that, without denying that human consciousness exists, we can understand it as coming about from the coordinated activity of many components in the brain that are themselves unconscious. In response, critics accused him of &quot;explaining away&quot; consciousness because he disputes the existence of certain conceptions of consciousness that he considers overblown and incompatible with what is physically possible. This is perhaps what motivated Dennett to make the greedy/good distinction in his follow-up book, to freely admit that reductionism can go overboard while pointing out that not all reductionism goes this far. 

A departure from strict reductionism in the opposite direction from greedy reductionism is called nonreductive physicalism. Nonreductive physicalists deny that a reductionistic analysis of a conscious system like the human mind is sufficient to explain all of the phenomena which are characteristic of that system. This idea is expressed in some theories that say consciousness is an emergent epiphenomenon that cannot be reduced to physiological properties of neurons. Those nonreductive physicalists, such as Colin McGinn, who claim the true relationship between the physical and the mental may be beyond scientific understanding—and therefore a &quot;mystery&quot;—have been dubbed mysterians by Owen Flanagan.

== Nothing-buttery ==

An older name for &#x27;greedy reductionism&#x27; is &quot;nothing-buttery&quot;, an expression based on the repeated phrase &quot;such-and-such is nothing but...&quot;. For example, in the article title, &quot;Consciousness is Nothing But a Word&quot;.

This 1955 example of the phrase demonstrates its use in its characteristic context:Yet one occasionally hears it said that the brain is nothing but a machine. The assertion is usually made in a slurring tone which implies that the brain has been overrated in some unspecified way and is supposed to put an end to further discussion. One investigator calls this &quot;nothing buttery&quot; thinking. It is certainly a grave insult to the brain—and to the machines.The expression began to be used in US English from 1953, and in UK English from the beginning of the 1960s. Its usage peaked in about 1970, but the phrase continues to be used up to the present.

The related expression &quot;nothing-but-ism&quot; appeared earlier, in the 1930s. One of its earliest documented uses was in a 1935 review by W. J. H. Sprott of Carl Jung&#x27;s book &quot;Man in Search of a Soul&quot; in the journal &quot;Mind&quot;. Sprott praised Jung&#x27;s book because &quot;it does not attempt to explain away spiritual aspiration, the antithesis of &#x27;nothing-but&#x27;-ism&quot;.

Although in the 1970s the phrase &quot;nothing-buttery&quot; had already been in use for at least twenty years, it is often associated with the scholar Donald Mackay, who popularized its use at that time and debated publicly with B. F. Skinner.

<doc id="189396" wikidata="Q599881" url="?curid=189396" title="Minamoto clan">
<text>was a noble surname bestowed by the Emperors of Japan upon members of the imperial family who were excluded from the line of succession and demoted into the ranks of the nobility since 814. Several noble lines were bestowed the surname, the most notable of which was the Seiwa Genji, whose descendants established the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates following the Heian era. The Minamoto was one of the four great clans that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian period in Japanese history—the other three were the Fujiwara, the Taira, and the Tachibana.

In the late Heian period, Minamoto rivalry with the Taira culminated in the Genpei War (1180–1185 AD). The Minamoto emerged victorious and established Japan&#x27;s first shogunate in Kamakura under Minamoto no Yoritomo, who appointed himself as &quot;shōgun&quot; in 1192, ushering in the Kamakura period (1192–1333 AD) of Japanese history. The name &quot;Genpei&quot; comes from alternate readings of the &quot;kanji&quot; &quot;Minamoto&quot; (源 &quot;Gen&quot;) and &quot;Taira&quot; (平 &quot;Hei&quot;).

The Kamakura Shogunate was overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo in the Kenmu Restoration of 1333. Three years later the Kenmu government would then itself be overthrown by the Ashikaga clan, descendants of the Seiwa Genji who established the Ashikaga shogunate (1333 to 1573).

The Minamoto clan is also called the , or less frequently, the , using the on&#x27;yomi readings of for &quot;Minamoto&quot;, while means &quot;clan&quot;, and is used as a suffix for &quot;extended family&quot;.

== History ==
The Emperors of Japan bestowed noble surnames upon members of the imperial family who were excluded from the line of succession and demoted into the ranks of the nobility. In May 814, the first emperor to grant the surname &quot;Minamoto&quot; was Emperor Saga, to his seventh son—Minamoto no Makoto, in Heian-Kyō (modern Kyōto). The practice was most prevalent during the Heian period (794–1185 AD), although its last occurrence was during the Sengoku period. The Taira were another such offshoot of the imperial dynasty, making both clans distant relatives. The most prominent of the several Minamoto families, the Seiwa Genji, descended from Minamoto no Tsunemoto (897–961), a grandson of Emperor Seiwa. Tsunemoto went to the provinces and became the founder of a major warrior dynasty. Minamoto no Mitsunaka (912–997) formed an alliance with the Fujiwara. Thereafter the Fujiwara frequently called upon the Minamoto to restore order in the capital, Heian-Kyō (modern Kyōto).Mitsunaka&#x27;s eldest son, Minamoto no Yorimitsu (948–1021), became the protégé of Fujiwara no Michinaga; another son, Minamoto no Yorinobu (968–1048) suppressed the rebellion of Taira no Tadatsune in 1032. Yorinobu&#x27;s son, Minamoto no Yoriyoshi (988–1075), and grandson, Minamoto no Yoshiie (1039–1106), pacified most of northeastern Japan between 1051 and 1087.

The Seiwa Genji&#x27;s fortunes declined in the Hōgen Rebellion (1156), when the Taira executed most of the line, including Minamoto no Tameyoshi. During the Heiji Disturbance (1160), the head of the Seiwa Genji, Minamoto no Yoshitomo, died in battle. Taira no Kiyomori seized power in Kyoto by forging an alliance with the retired emperors Go-Shirakawa and Toba and infiltrating the &quot;kuge&quot;. He sent Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199), the third son of Minamoto no Yoshimoto of the Seiwa Genji, into exile. In 1180, during the Genpei War, Yoritomo mounted a full-scale rebellion against the Taira rule, culminating in the destruction of the Taira and the subjugation of eastern Japan within five years. In 1192, he received the title &quot;shōgun&quot; and set up the first &quot;bakufu&quot; in the history of Japan at Kamakura—Kamakura shogunate.

The later Ashikaga (founders of the Ashikaga shogunate of Muromachi period), Nitta, Takeda, and Tokugawa (founders of the Tokugawa shogunate of Edo period) clans claim descents from the Minamoto clan (Seiwa Genji branch).

The protagonist of the classical Japanese novel &quot;The Tale of Genji (The Tale of Minamoto clan)—&quot;Hikaru Genji, was bestowed the name Minamoto for political reasons by his father the emperor and was delegated to civilian life and a career as an imperial officer.

The Genpei War is also the subject of the early Japanese epic &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; (&quot;Heike Monogatari&quot;).
== Members of the Minamoto clan (Genji clan) ==
Even within royalty there was a distinction between princes with the title , who could ascend to the throne, and princes with the title , who were not members of the line of imperial succession but nevertheless remained members of the royal class (and therefore outranked members of Minamoto clans). The bestowing of the Minamoto name on a (theretofore-)prince or his descendants excluded them from the royal class altogether, thereby operating as a reduction in legal and social rank even for &quot;ō&quot;-princes not previously in the line of succession.

Many later clans were formed by members of the Minamoto clan, and in many early cases, progenitors of these clans are known by either family name. There are also known monks of Minamoto descent; these are often noted in genealogies but did not carry the clan name (in favour of a dharma name).

The Minamoto is the ancestor and parent clan of many notable descendant clans, some of which are Ashikaga, Tokugawa, Matsudaira, Nitta, Takeda, Shimazu, Sasaki, Akamatsu, Kitabatake, Tada, Ota, Toki, Yamana, Satomi, Hosokawa, Satake, Yamamoto, Hemi, Ogasawara, Yasuda, Takenouchi, Hiraga, Imagawa, Miyake, etc.

There were 21 branches of the clan, each named after the emperor from whom it descended. Some of these lineages were populous, but a few did not produce descendants.

===Saga Genji===
The Saga Genji are descendants of Emperor Saga. As Saga had many children, many were bestowed the &quot;uji&quot; Minamoto, declassing them from imperial succession. Among his sons, Makoto, Tokiwa, and Tōru took the position of Minister of the Left (&quot;sadaijin&quot;); they were among the most powerful in the Imperial Court in the early Heian period. Some of Tōru&#x27;s descendants in particular settled the provinces and formed &quot;buke&quot;. Clans such as the Watanabe, Matsuura, and Kamachi descend from the Saga Genji.

Noted Saga Genji and descendants include:
* Minamoto no Makoto, seventh son of the Emperor
* Minamoto no Hiromu, eighth son of the Emperor
** Minamoto no Hitoshi, grandson of Hiromu
* Minamoto no Tokiwa, son of the Emperor
** Minamoto no Okoru, first son of Tokiwa
* Minamoto no Sadamu, son of the Emperor
** Minamoto no Shitagō, great-grandson of Sadamu
* Minamoto no Hiroshi, son of the Emperor
* Minamoto no Tōru, son of the Emperor
** Minamoto no Anbō (secular name Minamoto no Shitagō), great-grandson of Tōru
** Watanabe no Tsuna (his official name was Minamoto no Tsuna, who resided at Watanabe in Settsu province, and took the name of the place), great-great-grandson of Tōru
*** Matsuura Hisashi, great-grandson of Tsuna
** Minamoto no Koreshige, grandson of Tōru
*** Minamoto no Mitsusue, great-great-grandson of Koreshige
* Minamoto no Tsutomu, son of the Emperor
* Minamoto no Hiraku, son of the Emperor
History records indicate that at least three of Emperor Saga&#x27;s daughters were also made Minamoto (Minamoto no Kiyohime, Minamoto no Sadahime, and Minamoto no Yoshihime), but few records concerning his daughters are known.
===Ninmyō Genji===
They were descendants of Emperor Ninmyō. His sons Minamoto no Masaru and Minamoto no Hikaru were udaijin. Among Hikaru&#x27;s descendants was Minamoto no Atsushi, adoptive father of the Saga Genji&#x27;s Watanabe no Tsuna and father of the Seiwa Genji&#x27;s Minamoto no Mitsunaka&#x27;s wife.

===Montoku Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Montoku. Among them, Minamoto no Yoshiari was a sadaijin, and among his descendants were the Sakado clan who were Hokumen no Bushi.

===Seiwa Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Seiwa. The most numerous of them were those descended from Minamoto no Tsunemoto, son of Prince Sadazumi. Hachimantarō Yoshiie of the Kawachi Genji was a leader of a &quot;buke&quot;. His descendants set up the Kamakura shogunate, making his a prestigious pedigree claimed by many &quot;buke&quot;, particularly for the direct descendants in the Ashikaga clan (that set up the Ashikaga shogunate) and the rival Nitta clan. Centuries later, Tokugawa Ieyasu would claim descent from the Seiwa Genji by way of the Nitta clan.
===Yōzei Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Yōzei. While Minamoto no Tsunemoto is termed the ancestor of the Seiwa Genji, there is evidence (rediscovered in the late 19th century by Hoshino Hisashi) suggesting that he was actually the grandson of Emperor Yōzei rather than of Emperor Seiwa. This theory is not widely accepted as fact, but as Yōzei was deposed for reprehensible behaviour, there would have been a compelling motive to claim descent from more auspicious origins if it were the case.

===Kōkō Genji===

These were descendants of Emperor Kōkō. The great-grandson of his firstborn Prince Koretada, Kōshō, was the ancestor of a line of &quot;busshi&quot;, from which various styles of Buddhist sculpture emerged. Kōshō&#x27;s grandson Kakujo established the Shichijō Bussho workshop.

===Uda Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Uda. Two sons of Prince Atsumi, Minamoto no Masanobu and Minamoto no Shigenobu became &quot;sadaijin&quot;. Masanobu&#x27;s children in particular flourished, forming five &quot;dōjō&quot; houses as &quot;kuge&quot;, and as &quot;buke&quot; the Sasaki clan of the Ōmi Genji, and the Izumo Genji.
===Daigo Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Daigo. His son Minamoto no Takaakira became a &quot;sadaijin&quot;, but his downfall came during the Anna incident. Takaakira&#x27;s descendants include the Okamoto and Kawajiri clans. Daigo&#x27;s grandson Minamoto no Hiromasa was a reputed musician.

===Murakami Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Murakami. His grandson Morofusa was an &quot;udaijin&quot; and had many descendants, among them several houses of &quot;dōjō kuge&quot;. Until the Ashikaga clan took it during the Muromachi period, the title of &quot;Genji no Chōja&quot; always fell to one of Morofusa&#x27;s progeny.
===Reizei Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Reizei. Though they are included among the listing of 21 Genji lineages, no concrete record of the names of his descendants made Minamoto is known to survive.

===Kazan Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Kazan. They became the &quot;dōjō&quot; Shirakawa family, which headed the Jingi-kan for centuries, responsible for the centralised aspects of Shinto.
===Sanjō Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Sanjō&#x27;s son Prince Atsuakira. Starting with one of them, Minamoto no Michisue, the position of &quot;Ōkimi-no-kami&quot; (chief genealogist of the imperial family) in the Ministry of the Imperial Household was passed down hereditarily.

===Go-Sanjō Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Go-Sanjō&#x27;s son Prince Sukehito. Sukehito&#x27;s son Minamoto no Arihito was a &quot;sadaijin&quot;. Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s vassal Tashiro Nobutsuna, who appears in the &quot;Tale of the Heike&quot;, was allegedly Arihito&#x27;s grandson (according to the &quot;Genpei Jōsuiki&quot;).
===Go-Shirakawa Genji===
This line consisted solely of Emperor Go-Shirakawa son Mochihito-ō (Takakura-no-Miya). As part of the succession dispute that led to the opening hostilities of the Genpei War, he was declassed (renamed &quot;Minamoto no Mochimitsu&quot;) and exiled.

===Juntoku Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Juntoku&#x27;s sons Tadanari-ō and Prince Yoshimune. The latter&#x27;s grandson Yoshinari rose to &quot;sadaijin&quot; with the help of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.
===Go-Saga Genji===
This line consisted solely of Emperor Go-Saga&#x27;s grandson Prince Koreyasu. Koreyasu-ō was installed as a puppet &quot;shōgun&quot; (the seventh of the Kamakura shogunate) at a young age, and was renamed &quot;Minamoto no Koreyasu&quot; a few years later. After he was deposed, he regained royal status, and became a monk soon after, thereby losing the Minamoto name.
===Go-Fusakusa Genji===
These were descendants of Emperor Go-Fukakusa&#x27;s son Prince Hisaaki (the eighth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate). Hisaaki&#x27;s sons Prince Morikuni (the next &quot;shōgun&quot;) and Prince Hisayoshi were made Minamoto. Hisayoshi&#x27;s adopted &quot;nephew&quot; (actually Nijō Michihira&#x27;s son) Muneaki became a &quot;gon-dainagon&quot; (acting &quot;dainagon&quot;).

===Ōgimachi Genji===
These were non-royal descendants of Emperor Ōgimachi. At first they were &quot;buke&quot;, but they later became &quot;dōjō-ke&quot;, the Hirohata family.

<doc id="189399" wikidata="Q1079102" url="?curid=189399" title="Taira clan">
<text>The was one of the four most important clans that dominated Japanese politics during the Heian period of Japanese history – the others being the Minamoto, the Fujiwara, and the Tachibana. The clan is divided into four major groups, named after the emperors they descended from: Kanmu Heishi, Ninmyō Heishi, Montoku Heishi, and Kōkō Heishi, the most influential of which was the Kanmu Heishi line.

In the twilight of the Heian period, the Taira controlled the boy emperor Antoku (himself the grandson of the powerful &quot;Kugyō&quot; Taira no Kiyomori) and had effectively dominated the Imperial capital of Heian. However, they were opposed by their rivals the Minamoto clan (the Genji), which culminated in the Genpei War (1180–1185 AD). The five-year-long war concluded with a decisive Taira defeat in the naval Battle of Dan-no-Ura, which resulted in the deaths of Antoku and Taira leaders. Following the war, the victorious Minamoto established Japan&#x27;s first shogunate in Kamakura. The name &quot;Genpei&quot; comes from alternate readings of the &quot;kanji&quot; &quot;Minamoto&quot; (源 &quot;Gen&quot;) and &quot;Taira&quot; (平 &quot;Hei&quot;).

The clan is commonly referred to as or , using the character&#x27;s On&#x27;yomi for &quot;Taira&quot;, while means &quot;clan&quot;, and is used as a suffix for &quot;extended family&quot;. The clan is the namesake of &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, an epic account of the Genpei War.

==History==

Along with the Minamoto, Taira was one of the honorary surnames given by the emperors of the Heian period (794–1185) to their children and grandchildren who were not considered eligible for the throne.

The clan was founded when the Imperial Court grew too large, and the emperor ordered that the descendants of previous emperors from several generations ago would no longer be princes but would instead be given noble surnames and ranks. The decision became applicable during the reign of Emperor Kanmu (782–805) and thus, together with the Minamoto clan, the Taira clan was born.

Some grandchildren of Emperor Kanmu were the first to bear the name of Taira, after 825. Later, descendants of Emperor Nimmyo, Emperor Montoku and Emperor Koko also received the surname. The specific hereditary lines of these emperors are referred to by the posthumous name of the emperor followed by Heishi, for example &quot;Kanmu Heishi&quot;.

The Kanmu Heishi line has two major branches. One was founded in 889 by Taira no Takamochi (great-grandson of the 50th Emperor Kanmu, who reigned from 781 to 806) proved to be the strongest and most dominant line during the Heian period. A great-grandson of Takamochi, Taira no Korehira, moved to Ise Province (currently part of Mie Prefecture) and established an important Daimyo dynasty. Masamori, his grandson; and Tadamori, his great-grandson, became loyal supporters of Emperor Shirakawa and Emperor Toba, respectively. Later, Tadamori&#x27;s son, Taira no Kiyomori, created what was considered the first samurai government in the history of Japan.

Taira no Kiyomori, son and heir of Tadamori, rose to the position of Daijō Daijin (great Minister of State), after his victories in the Hōgen Rebellion (1156) and the Heiji Rebellion (1160). Kiyomori succeeded in enthroning his youngest grandson as Emperor Antoku in 1180, an act that led to the Genpei War (Genpei no Sōran, 1180–1185). The last leader of the Kanmu Heishi bloodline, was eventually destroyed by Minamoto no Yoritomo&#x27;s armies at the Battle of Dan-no-ura, the last battle of the Genpei War. This story is told in the Heike Monogatari.

This branch of the Kanmu Heishi had many collateral branches, including Hōjō, Chiba, Miura and Hatakeyama.

The other major branch of Kanmu Heishi was founded by Takamune-ō (804–867), the eldest son of Prince Imperial Kazurahara and grandson of Emperor Kanmu, who received the title of Taira no Ason in the year 825. Members of this branch served as middle-class kuge in the Imperial Court of Kyoto.

The Oda clan at the time of Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582) also claimed Taira descent, they were descendants of Taira no Chikazane, grandson of Taira no Shigemori (1138–1179).

== Genpei War ==
During the Heiji Rebellion (1160), the Seiwa Genji leader, Minamoto no Yoshitomo, died in battle. Taira no Kiyomori gained power in Kyoto forging alliances with retired emperors Shirakawa and Toba. Kiyomori sent Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199), the third son of Yoshitomo, into exile. In 1180, Yoritomo organized a large-scale rebellion against the rule of the Taira (the Genpei War or &quot;Taira-Minamoto&quot;), culminated with the destruction of the Taira by the Minamoto clan and the subjugation of eastern Japan in five years. In 1192, Minamoto no Yoritomo received the title shogun and created the first bakufu based in Kamakura (Kanagawa Prefecture).

== Branches ==

<doc id="189405" wikidata="Q232564" url="?curid=189405" title="Cundinamarca Department">
<text>Department of Cundinamarca (, ) is one of the departments of Colombia. Its area covers (not including the Capital District) and it has a population of 2,919,060 as of 2018. It was created on August 5, 1886, under the constitutional terms presented on the same year. Cundinamarca is located in the center of Colombia.

Cundinamarca&#x27;s capital city is Bogotá, the capital of Colombia. This is a special case among Colombian departments, since Bogotá is not legally a part of Cundinamarca, yet it is the only department that has its capital designated by the Constitution (if the capital were to be ever moved, it would take a constitutional reform to do so, instead of a simple ordinance passed by the Cundinamarca Assembly). In censuses, the populations for Bogotá and Cundinamarca are tabulated separately; otherwise, Cundinamarca&#x27;s population would total over 11 million.

== Etymology ==
The name of Cundinamarca comes from &quot;Kuntur marqa&quot;, an indigenous expression, probably derived from Quechuan and means &quot;condor&#x27;s nest&quot;.

== Geography ==
Most of Cundinamarca is on the Eastern Cordillera (&quot;Cordillera Oriental&quot;), just south of Boyacá, bordered by the Magdalena River on the west, reaching down into the Orinoco River basin on the east, and bordering on Tolima to the south. The capital district of Bogotá is nearly completely surrounded by Cundinamarca territory and was formed by carving up Cundinamarca. Because of this and other border changes, the present department of Cundinamarca is much smaller than the original state.

== Demography and ethnography ==
=== Municipalities with over 50,000 inhabitants ===

==== Municipal population position ====
According to the latest census conducted in 2005, 2,280,037 people live in Cundinamarca, excluding 6,776,009 of the capital, Bogotá.
The city of Bogotá and the municipalities of Soacha, La Calera, Cota, Chía, Madrid, Funza, Mosquera, Fusagasugá, Facatativá and Zipaquirá form a single metropolitan area.

==== Important cities ====
Cundinamarca is made up of 116 municipalities, six of which recorded a population of over 100,000 and could be considered as cities: Soacha, Fusagasugá, Girardot, Facatativá, Zipaquirá and Chia, while Bogotá District is in the category of capital.

* Metropolitan Area of Bogotá: Comprises the towns of Soacha, Facatativá, Chia, Madrid, Funza, and Mosquera, among others. Its activities are centered in the industrial sector. Estate activity is important especially in the suburbs closer to Bogotá: Chía, La Calera and Tocancipá.
* Girardot: In the far southwest and bordering Department of Tolima, is the capital of the Upper Magdalena Province. Its main economic activity is trade, as a result of a major tourist dynamics and its proximity to major agricultural areas of Tolima. It has a college and important trade fairs and events.
* Fusagasugá is located between Bogotá and Girardot, and it is an hour of each city. The capital city of the Province of Sumapaz, it is an important focus of agricultural marketing and regional services, standing out as an educational city with a large university and an increasing population trend. Its economy is mainly focused on trade and agricultural marketing, with a significant production of ornamental plants and flowers for export, for which it is known as the garden city of Colombia.
* Zipaquirá: Despite being part of the metropolitan area of Bogotá, it has managed to position itself as one of the most important centers of Colombia&#x27;s salt mining industry. Its economy is focused on commerce and services.

Other major towns are Ubaté due to high livestock and dairy production. Guaduas, is an important cultural center. Chocontá and Fred are agricultural centers.

== Provinces ==

Cundinamarca has 15 provinces and the Capital District (Bogotá), which simultaneously acts as capital of the Republic, capital of the Department and a separately administered District (or Department) in itself.

<text>Darryl Eugene Strawberry (born March 12, 1962) is an American former professional baseball right fielder who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Throughout his career, Strawberry was one of the most feared sluggers in the sport, known for his prodigious home runs and his intimidating presence in the batter&#x27;s box with his frame and his long, looping swing that elicited comparisons to Ted Williams.

Strawberry, who was nicknamed &quot;the Straw Man&quot; or &quot;Straw&quot;, helped lead the New York Mets to a World Series championship in and the New York Yankees to two World Series championships in and . He was also suspended three times by MLB for substance abuse, leading to many narratives about his massive potential going unfulfilled. A popular player during his career, Strawberry was voted to the All-Star Game eight straight times from 1984 to 1991. Strawberry was formerly an analyst for SportsNet New York. His memoir, &quot;Straw: Finding My Way&quot;, written with author John Strausbaugh, was published in April 2009.

==Early life and education==
Strawberry was born to Henry and Ruby Strawberry in Los Angeles, California. He played high school baseball for the Crenshaw High School Cougars along with Chris Brown. As an 18-year-old out of Los Angeles’ Crenshaw High School, Strawberry signed a letter of intent with Oklahoma State, to play baseball for Gary Ward. Alas, a couple of months later, Strawberry was the first overall pick in the amateur draft, and he signed with the Mets in July 1980. Darryl&#x27;s older brother Michael Strawberry was also a star baseball athlete who would play professional baseball.

==Professional baseball career==
===Early career===
The New York Mets selected Strawberry with the first overall selection in the 1980 Major League Baseball draft. Darryl&#x27;s older brother, Michael Strawberry, was also selected in that draft, going to the Dodgers in the 31st round.

Employing a distinctive batting stance with a high leg kick, Strawberry rose through the Mets system and reached the major league level in 1983, posting 26 home runs, 7 triples, and 74 runs batted in, while hitting for a .257 average. He was named the National League&#x27;s Rookie of The Year. In 1984, he made it to the All-Star game for the first of 8 consecutive appearances (the first 5 as a starter), and he once again hit 26 home runs, this time driving in 97 runs.

===Prime years===
Strawberry&#x27;s Mets from 1984–1990 formed one of the premier teams in the National League, finishing either first or second in the division every year.

During the period from 1983 to 1990, Strawberry was very popular, with his image used on action figures (Kenner&#x27;s &quot;Starting Lineup&quot;), posters and banners.

On May 11. 1985, Strawberry suffered torn ligaments in his thumb, making a diving catch off of Ozzie Virgil of the Philadelphia Phillies. This required surgery, and Strawberry missed the team&#x27;s next 43 games, not returning until June 28. The injury was devastating to the Mets, who went only 20-23 (.465) without Strawberry (as opposed to 78-41 [.655] in all other games) and lost the National League East title to the St. Louis Cardinals by only three games.

On October 1, 1985, the Mets began a 3-game series in St. Louis, trailing the Cardinals by three games with only six remaining to play. It seemed that they would need to sweep the series in order to have a chance at the title. After starting pitchers Ron Darling of the Mets and John Tudor of the Cardinals dueled scorelessly into extra innings, Strawberry provided the only run of the Mets&#x27; 1-0 victory in the 11th inning, hitting a massive home run off of Ken Dayley that hit the clock on the scoreboard in the right field stands of Busch Stadium. (The Mets won the next game, 5-2, behind Dwight Gooden, but lost the final game, 4-3, despite five hits by Keith Hernandez.) For the season, Strawberry hit 29 home runs and drove in 79 runs; his .947 OPS would have been 2nd in the National League (behind Pedro Guerrero of the Los Angeles Dodgers) if the injury had not limited him to 470 plate appearances.

The 1986 Mets jumped to an early lead (a 4-game sweep of the Cardinals in St. Louis was pivotal) and cruised easily to the divisional title, setting a team record with 108 wins.
Strawberry hit 27 home runs and had 93 RBIs, as the Mets defeated the Houston Astros in the National League Championship Series and rallied after losing the first two games at home to defeat the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. With the Mets having rallied to take a 6-5 lead in the 8th inning of Game 7, Strawberry hit a home run off of Al Nipper to seal the victory and the series. He took a notably-slow home run trot around the bases, leading to Nipper throwing at him and igniting a brawl between the teams during spring training, the next season.

In 1987, Strawberry hit 39 home runs and stole 36 bases, joining the exclusive 30–30 club at the time becoming one of only 10 players in baseball history to accomplish the feat. (Teammate Howard Johnson [36 HR, 32 SB] also accomplished the feat; to this day, Strawberry and Johnson are the only teammates to have ever gone 30/30 in the same season.) In addition to that, he hit 32 doubles and drove in 104 runs. Despite this, the 1987 team, plagued by pitching injuries, missed the playoffs.

On Opening Day in 1988, Strawberry hit a massive home run (estimated at 525 ft.) that struck the roof of Olympic Stadium in Montreal. For the season, Strawberry once again hit 39 home runs (despite a general decline in home run totals in all of baseball from the atypical 1987 season) to lead the National League for a second time. Strawberry also led the league in slugging percentage at .545 and OPS at .911 and finished second with 101 runs batted in. He finished a very close second in MVP voting to the Dodgers&#x27; Kirk Gibson. Strawberry led the Mets to the playoffs, losing to the Dodgers in seven games in the National League Championship Series.

In 1989, Strawberry&#x27;s offensive numbers declined: he had 29 home runs and 77 runs batted in, but only had a .225 average. Nevertheless, the Mets came in a close second place to the Chicago Cubs in the National League East.

In 1990, Strawberry rebounded by hitting 37 home runs, driving in 108 runs and batting for a .277 average. His Mets, however, came once again in a close second place in the National League East, losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates by three games. Strawberry himself finished third in MVP voting that season.

Despite his accomplishments, Strawberry was sometimes criticized for disruptive behavior. He got into a physical altercation on team picture day with team captain Keith Hernandez and in the midst of a war of words with infielder Wally Backman, threatened to &quot;bust that little redneck in the face&quot;. On multiple occasions, he overslept and was late for, or missed, team workouts.

Strawberry signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers on November 8, 1990, inking a lucrative five-year $22.25 million contract. In California, he was named &quot;Big Brother of The Year&quot; for 1991. After hitting 28 home runs and bringing in 99 runs batted in a successful first year for the Dodgers, injuries and personal problems kept him sidelined for much of the next two seasons, hitting five home runs in each season.

By the end of the 1991 season, he had 280 lifetime homers at the age of only 29, drawing comparisons to then home run king Hank Aaron.

===Later years===
Strawberry&#x27;s numbers tailed off considerably after 1991; over the next two years he only played in 75 games. In 1994, he was released in May by the Dodgers after failing to show up to a game. Later that season he signed with the San Francisco Giants, where he saw limited playing time as he tried to make a comeback, hitting only four home runs and driving in 17 runs that year.

After a suspension at the beginning of 1995 after testing positive for cocaine, Strawberry signed with the New York Yankees for the stretch run. The next year, Darryl signed with the Saint Paul Saints of the Northern League on May 3, 1996, in an attempt to rehabilitate. On June 2, the Saints faced the Duluth–Superior Dukes at Wade Stadium, where Strawberry hit his first home run for the Saints, at a distance of 522&#x27; off pitcher Pat Ahearne. Soon thereafter, he found himself back with the Yankees, who signed him on July 4, 1996.

With the Yankees, he showed flashes of his former brilliance, belting 11 home runs in a part-time role and helping his team win the World Series in 1996 alongside former Mets teammates Dwight Gooden and David Cone. His second career three-homer game came against the Chicago White Sox on August 6 of that season.

He had a big series against the Baltimore Orioles in the 1996 ALCS as he blasted three home runs with five RBIs and a .417 average in four games. In 1997, he did not have any home runs, with his playing time limited by injuries. He played in just 11 games that year, collecting just two runs batted in.

In 1998, he had 24 home runs, once again helping the Yankees win the World Series and playing 100 games for the first time since 1991. However, he suffered abdominal pain for around two months, which he did not disclose to his teammates or staff, and his playing time declined late in the season. Strawberry was diagnosed with colon cancer during the American League Division Series (ALDS), and he was replaced on the roster by rookie Ricky Ledée. In 1999, he made a comeback from his cancer treatment, but saw limited playing time, hitting 3 home runs. He did however hit a crucial 3-run home run against the Texas Rangers in the ALDS, helping the Yankees advance to the ALCS.

Strawberry was set to return to the Yankees in 2000, but after testing positive for cocaine in February while attending spring training, Strawberry was ordered to leave the team while waiting for commissioner Bud Selig to make a decision on a possible suspension. Six days after news of the positive test broke, Selig announced that Strawberry would be suspended for the entire 2000 season, effectively ending his career.

===Career accomplishments===
Strawberry was the starting right fielder in five straight All-Star games and appeared in a total of nine All-Star games. He batted .333 with two stolen bases and two runs in 12 career All-Star at-bats. He had two three-home run games in his career, both of which came against Chicago teams and were almost 11 years to the day between each other. The first came against the Cubs on August 5, 1985, and the second was on August 6, 1996, against the White Sox.

He is one of only five Major League Baseball players to hit two pinch-hit grand slams in the same season. The others are his former coach Davey Johnson, who did it as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies, as well as Mike Ivie of the San Francisco Giants, Ben Broussard of the Cleveland Indians, and Brooks Conrad of the Atlanta Braves.

He is one of only three players in MLB history, along with former Yankees teammate Ricky Ledée and José Vizcaíno, to have played for all four of the former and current New York-based MLB teams: the Mets, Yankees, Dodgers and Giants. However, of the three, Strawberry is the only one to have played solely for the four teams with New York heritage; Ledée and Vizcaino were journeymen who played for numerous other teams.

==Post-playing life==
Strawberry attended the Mets&#x27; 1986 World Champion team reunion on August 19, 2006, where the team received a standing ovation from fans at Shea Stadium in an on-field ceremony. He worked as an instructor for the New York Mets in 2005 and 2008, and was inducted to the Mets Hall of Fame in 2010.

He has made regular appearances at the New York Yankees&#x27; Old Timer&#x27;s Day, most recently in 2023.

He threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Shea Stadium before Game 1 of the National League Championship Series between the Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals on October 12, 2006. He was given a rousing ovation by the Shea Stadium crowd. He served as an anchor on the Mets pre- and post- game shows on SNY in 2007 and 2008, eventually settling into a part-time analysis role for the 2009 season.

He opened his own restaurant, Strawberry&#x27;s Sports Grill, in Douglaston, Queens in August 2010. The restaurant closed in October 2012.

On August 24, 2023, the Mets announced plans to retire Strawberry&#x27;s number 18 - along with the number 16 of former teammate Dwight Gooden - in a ceremony during the 2024 baseball season. His number was retired on June 1, 2024. In his acceptance speech, Strawberry apologized to Mets fans for leaving to sign with the Dodgers, saying it was &quot;the greatest mistake I ever made&quot;.

==Personal life==
Strawberry is an evangelical born-again Christian and has appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. In 1999, he and Tiny Lister appeared on evangelist Benny Hinn&#x27;s television program giving their testimonies. Strawberry has also appeared on &quot;The 700 Club&quot; to talk about his life and his newfound Christian faith. He eventually became an ordained minister.

Strawberry frequently donates to charity and was a headliner of the BGC Charity Day event at BGC Partners in 2010.

In October 2005, his wife Charisse filed for divorce. After a second divorce, he married his third wife, Tracy Boulware, in October 2006; the couple shares a vigorous Christian faith.

In 2006, he moved to St. Peters, Missouri with his third wife Tracy whom he met in a drug recovery convention. After they were married they founded &quot;The Darryl Strawberry Foundation&quot;, an organization dedicated to children with autism. Strawberry&#x27;s son, Darryl &quot;D.J.&quot; Strawberry, Jr., born in 1985, was a star shooting guard with the Maryland Terrapins men&#x27;s basketball team and was drafted by the Phoenix Suns in the 2007 NBA draft. Strawberry has another son, Jordan, who played college basketball for the Mercer Bears.

Strawberry has stated that his father was an alcoholic who was verbally and physically abusive to him and his brothers. He attributes his initial alcohol and drug use to the pain he endured as a child and his subsequent substance abuse to the pressures of performing in New York.

On September 26, 2020, Strawberry led a prayer in the 2020 Franklin Graham Prayer March.

===Legal and health problems===
Strawberry has described himself as having struggled with a sex addiction. After retirement he admitted to routinely having sex between innings of MLB games in which he played.

On December 19, 1995, Strawberry was charged in California with failing to make child support payments. When he missed a June 5, 1996, deadline to pay the child support, a Los Angeles judge set a trial date of July 17, at which time Strawberry agreed to use his signing bonus to pay the debt.

In August 1998, Strawberry was sued by attorney Robert Shapiro for failing to pay $100,000 in legal fees, dating back to 1994, when Shapiro represented him in a contract with the Dodgers.

On October 1, 1998, Strawberry was diagnosed with colon cancer. Two days later, he had surgery to remove a tumor. On October 14, doctors announced that cancer had been detected in a lymph node so he would also have to undergo chemotherapy.

On April 3, 1999, Strawberry was arrested in Tampa, Florida for soliciting sex from a policewoman posing as a prostitute and for having a small amount of cocaine. On April 24, he was suspended for 140 days by Major League Baseball for the incident. On May 29, he pleaded no contest to the charges and was sentenced to 21 months probation and community service.

On July 28, 2000, a C.T. scan suggested that Strawberry&#x27;s cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. The next month, he had surgery to remove a tumor near his left kidney on August 7.

On September 11, 2000, in Tampa, Florida, Strawberry tried to drive to see his probation officer after taking painkillers. While driving, he blacked out, rear-ended another car, and then tried to drive away. An off-duty police officer witnessed the episode and arrested him at gunpoint. The next day, Strawberry admitted to the charges and his probation was changed to two years of house arrest. On November 21, he was sentenced to a year of probation and community service. On October 25, 2000, Strawberry left a Tampa drug treatment center to use drugs with a female friend, violating his house arrest and parole. On November 9, he was sentenced to 40 days in jail with credit for time served. On November 3, 2000, Strawberry told a judge in Tampa that he had lost his will to live and had stopped chemotherapy. On November 30, he was released from jail and sent back to rehab. On April 2, 2001, Strawberry was arrested for again disappearing from his house arrest drug treatment center in Tampa. On May 1, he was sentenced to more time at a drug treatment center.

On March 12, 2002, Strawberry was back in jail for violating several non-drug rules at the drug treatment center where he was on probation in Ocala, Florida. On April 29, he was ordered to serve the 22-month suspended prison sentence from 1999. On April 8, 2003, he was released from prison after 11 months.

In September 2005, Strawberry was charged with filing a false police report after he claimed his SUV was stolen. He admitted that he had lied on the report but was not arrested because it was a misdemeanor.

On or about March 11, 2024, Strawberry suffered a heart attack, underwent a stent procedure and reported that he was recovering in a hospital in Lake St. Louis, Missouri. He recovered and was able to attend the ceremony where the Mets retired Gooden&#x27;s number 16 on April 14, as well as his own retirement ceremony on June 1.

==In media==

Strawberry appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; seven times: five times by himself, once with Don Mattingly, and once with Dwight Gooden.

In 1988, he was featured heavily in the William Goldman and Mike Lupica book &quot;Wait Till Next Year&quot;, which looked at life inside the Mets over a whole season (among other New York sports teams). It gives a frank account of both his importance to the team and his problematic behavior.

In 2004, the Rebecca Gilman play &quot;The Sweetest Swing in Baseball&quot; premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London. The lead character ‒ Dana, as portrayed by Gillian Anderson ‒ adopts the personality and speech of Darryl Strawberry in an attempt to pass herself off as schizophrenic. The title is a reference to Strawberry&#x27;s playing skills.

Strawberry appeared, as himself, in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;. He was a featured pro on the second season of the physical reality game show &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot;. He currently does occasional commentary for baseball on SportsNet New York.

In 2010, Strawberry appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Apprentice&quot; with Sharon Osbourne, Cyndi Lauper, Bret Michaels, and others. At the end of the third episode, Strawberry was fired after he admitted he was the weakest contestant, was tired, and wanted to go home. Donald Trump sent him home. After Strawberry made a successful return in the season finale to assist Bret Michaels, the show made a donation of $25,000 to The Darryl Strawberry Foundation. Strawberry placed 12th.

On February 8, 2011, Strawberry appeared along with Clara Hughes and Stephane Richer on a Canadian documentary by Michael Landsberg to talk about his battle with depression.

On Wednesday, November 15, 2017, Strawberry appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; to talk about his new book &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Me&quot;, which sheds light on addiction and recovery.

<text>The Hales Trophy, officially the North Atlantic Blue Riband Challenge Trophy is an award for the fastest Atlantic crossing by a commercial passenger vessel.

The award was created in 1935 when Harold K. Hales, a British politician and owner of Hales Brothers shipping company, donated the trophy to be a permanent, tangible expression of the Blue Riband, the unofficial accolade then given for this feat. Hales also wished to formalize the rules regarding the contest, which up to then had no official form, though they were, by tradition, widely recognized. The rules for the Hales Trophy were different from the traditional rules for the Blue Riband, and changed several times. For example, the Hales Trophy was originally only awarded for westbound records.

The trophy was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders during the express liner era; to the Italian liner &quot;Rex&quot; in 1935, the French &quot;Normandie&quot; in 1936, and the American &quot;United States&quot; in 1952. Cunard&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, Blue Riband holder in 1936 and again from 1938 until 1952, did not receive the award for various reasons.

Following the retirement of &quot;United States&quot; in 1969 the award languished, until revived in 1990 for the Incat built passenger/car ferry &quot;Hoverspeed Great Britain&quot; when she established a new speed record for a commercial vessel on her eastbound delivery voyage without passengers that year. The trophy has been won twice since then, each time by an Incat built vessel.

==The trophy==
In 1935, Harold K. Hales (1868–1942), a member of the UK Parliament and owner of a shipping company, commissioned a Sheffield goldsmith to produce a large trophy to be presented to the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic. The four-foot-tall, nearly 100-pound Hales Trophy is made of solid silver and heavy gilt fashioned with a globe resting on two winged figures of Victory standing on a base of carved green onyx, with an enamelled blue ribbon encircling the middle, and decorated with models of galleons, modern ocean liners and statues of Neptune and Amphitrite, god and goddess of the sea. The trophy is surmounted by a figure depicting speed pushing a three-stacked liner against a figure symbolizing the forces of the Atlantic, which is represented in blue enamel with the traditional ocean liner route indicated by a red enamelled line.

==History==
The rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the Blue Riband, in that the trophy was to be awarded only to a passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction. Other rule changes further complicated the situation. For example, before the trophy was finished, Hales made arrangements to present the trophy to the owners of &quot;Rex&quot;, the then Blue Riband record-holder. In the meantime, &quot;Normandie&quot; took the record and Hales changed the rules so that any new claimant must wait three months to give the current holder a chance to beat the new record. In August 1935, the trophy was presented to the &quot;Rex&quot;, and then transferred to the &quot;Normandie&quot; two months later. Cunard White Star&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mary&quot; was the next winner, but Cunard White Star refused to accept the trophy. The &quot;Queen&quot;&#x27;s captain explained that, &quot;We don&#x27;t believe in racing on the Atlantic, or in blue ribands, or trophies and the like.&quot; Hales again changed the rules so that the trophy could only be won by a &quot;non-British ship&quot;.

Hales died in 1942 and the location of the trophy was unknown when the United States Lines (USL) started planning the maiden voyage of its new record breaker, the &quot;United States&quot;. The trophy was found at the Sheffield goldsmith where it had been originally made. In 1952, USL accepted the trophy at a ceremony attended by 400 guests. It was displayed in USL&#x27;s New York City headquarters until after the &quot;United States&quot; was taken out of service in 1969. Ten years later, the trophy was transferred to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy&#x27;s museum as a relic.
In 1986, Richard Branson was successful in setting a new eastbound transatlantic speed record in the powerboat &quot;Challenger II&quot;. He was not awarded the Hales trophy because his boat was not a commercial vessel. In 1990, the catamaran passenger/car ferry &quot;Hoverspeed Great Britain&quot; was scheduled to take a delivery voyage from her Australian builders to begin cross channel operations. Her owners confirmed with the Hales trophy trustees in the UK that their vessel would be eligible for the trophy if they beat the &quot;United States&quot; record, even though the ship would not actually carry passengers on the trip. The trustees ruled that the ship still met the criteria. After &quot;Hoverspeed Great Britain&#x27;s&quot; successful voyage, the Maritime Museum considered challenging the decision on the grounds that Hales donated the award for ships providing Atlantic passenger service, but decided not to because of the cost of legal fees. In 1992, the Italian powerboat &quot;Destriero&quot; made a voyage at , breaking &quot;Challenger II&#x27;s&quot; record, though she was not awarded the Hales Trophy either. In June 1998 the trophy was won by &quot;Catalonia&quot; on her delivery voyage (without passengers) at , followed a month later by the current holder of the Hales Trophy, the catamaran &quot;Cat-Link V&quot; (now &quot;Skane Jet&quot;) for a 1998 delivery voyage at . The trophy resided on the premises of the owners of &quot;Cat-Link V&quot;, Scandlines, until 2010 when they opted to put it on display in the lobby of The Danish Shipowners&#x27; Association, Amaliegade 33, Copenhagen. The Association, of which Scandlines is a member, then had it for a couple of years. An interactive screen was created and installed, telling the highlights of the trophy&#x27;s history, and a longer printed version with illustrations was placed next to the trophy case for all interested to take home. The trophy was subsequently returned to Scandlines&#x27; main office in Copenhagen, where it still stands.

Several replicas of the Hales Trophy exist. 
In 1998 Carnival Cruise Lines commissioned a replica for display on its cruise ship MS &quot;Paradise&quot;. They also had a duplicate made, for permanent loan to the Merchant Marine Academy Museum.
INCAT, the builders of the last three winners of the Hales Trophy, are in possession of a museum quality replica which is displayed at their Fast Ferry Museum in Hobart, Tasmania. The formal records of the Hales Trophy Trustees are now lodged with Lloyds Register in London. Anyone wishing to access the formal records should contact Lloyds Register regarding obtaining permission to inspect the Hales Trophy Trust records.

<text>was the second &quot;shōgun&quot; (1202–1203) of Japan&#x27;s Kamakura shogunate, and the first son of first shōgun Yoritomo. His Dharma name was Hokke-in-dono Kingo Da&#x27;i Zengo (法華院殿金吾大禅閤).

== Life ==
Minamoto no Yoriie was born to Hōjō Masako at Hiki Yoshikazu&#x27;s residence in Kamakura. Before he was born, his father Yoritomo had Hōjō Tokimasa and his men carry stones to build the Dankazura on Wakamiya Ōji to pray for the child&#x27;s safe delivery. When Yoriie later himself had an heir, Ichiman, the child was also born at the Hiki mansion to Hiki&#x27;s daughter Wakasa no Tsubone, a fact which further consolidated an already strong emotional bond. From this relationship Hiki gained considerable influence when Yoriie became shōgun, incurring the hostility of Hōjō Tokimasa, who was instead close to Yoriie&#x27;s younger brother Senman (future third shōgun Sanetomo), and who was in his turn trying to leverage that relationship for political advantage. His childhood name was Manju (万寿).

When he was young, he was interested in military arts like fencing, and horse-riding. After his father&#x27;s death in 1199, the 17-year-old became head of the Minamoto clan and was appointed &quot;sei-i taishōgun&quot; in 1202. He was, however, criticized for his abandonment of his father&#x27;s policies, and his mother forbade him from any political activity. On June 30, 1203, his remaining powers were formally taken from him and assumed by a council of 13 elders, headed by his grandfather Hōjō Tokimasa. He ordained as a Buddhist monk. Yoriie, in turn, plotted with the Hiki to subjugate the Hōjō clan. However, he failed, and was put under house arrest, where he was forced to abdicate. Then on July 17, 1204, he was assassinated in his mansion in Izu. Yoriie was succeeded by his younger brother Sanetomo, the last of the Minamoto shogun to rule over Kamakura.

==Hiki Yoshikazu&#x27;s rebellion==

Seriously ill, Yoriie proposed to name both his younger brother, Minamoto no Sanetomo, and his young son Minamoto no Ichiman to succeed him; the two would split power, governing separate parts of the country. It seemed natural to them that Hiki would then be the regent, even if unofficially, of young Ichiman. Hiki suggested to Yoriie that they arrange to have Sanetomo killed. Hōjō Masako, Yoriie&#x27;s mother and wife of the first shōgun Yoritomo, allegedly overheard the conversation.

On a pretext, Hōjō Tokimasa invited Hiki Yoshikazu to his home and assassinated him. A battle between the clans ensued, the Hiki were defeated by a coalition of the Hōjō, Wada, Miura and Hatakeyama clans and were exterminated.

Yoriie died in Shuzenji, a small town in what was later called Izu Province, assassinated by his grandfather Hōjō Tokimasa.

==The sons of Yoriie==
Yoriie had two sons, Ichiman and Kugyō. Both of his sons would end up dead, like their father they would fall victim to the power struggle that followed Yoritomo&#x27;s death. Ichiman (1198–1203) was the eldest. His mother, Wakasa no Tsubone, was Hiki Yoshikazu&#x27;s daughter, and the child was brought up by the Hiki clan. It is said that he died in a fire that destroyed the Hiki residence.

Yoriie&#x27;s second son Yoshinari, his only son to reach adulthood, was forced to become a Buddhist monk. In 1219, Yoshinari murdered his uncle Sanetomo on the stairs leading to the shrine of Tsurugaoka Hachimangū in the shogunal capital of Kamakura, an act for which he was himself slain on the same day.

==Family==
* Father: Minamoto no Yoritomo
* Mother: Hōjō Masako
* Wife: Wakasa no Tsubone (d. 1203)
* Children:
** Minamoto no Ichiman
** Kugyō

==Eras of Yoriie&#x27;s &quot;bakufu&quot;==
The years in which Yoriie was shōgun are all within only one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;: &quot;Kennin&quot; (1201–1204).

<doc id="189412" wikidata="Q3025364" url="?curid=189412" title="Harrison Bergeron">
<text>&quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; is a satirical dystopian science-fiction short story by American writer Kurt Vonnegut, first published in October 1961. Originally published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, the story was republished in the author&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; collection in 1968.

==Plot==
In the year 2081, the Constitution dictates that all Americans are fully equal and not allowed to be smarter, better-looking, or more physically able than anyone else. This is due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th amendments. Diana Moon Glampers, the Handicapper General, and her agents enforce the equality laws by forcing citizens to wear &quot;handicaps&quot; such as ugly masks for those who are too beautiful, earpiece radios for the intelligent that broadcast irritating noises meant to disrupt thoughts, and heavy weights for the strong or athletic.

George and Hazel Bergeron have a 14-year old son named Harrison. He takes after his father, who is highly intelligent and physically strong. The government removes Harrison from his home. His parents are barely aware because of Hazel&#x27;s low intelligence and George&#x27;s mandated handicaps.

George and Hazel watch a ballet on TV one day. Some dancers are weighed down to counteract their gracefulness and masked to hide their attractiveness. George&#x27;s thoughts are continually interrupted by the different noises emitted by his handicap radio. Hazel urges George to lie down and rest his &quot;handicap bag,&quot; (which is a cloth bag filled with birdshot locked around his neck). She suggests taking a few of the weights out of the bag, but George resists because it is against the law and he will have to endure two years of prison and pay a $2,000 fine per every birdshot he takes out.

On TV, a reporter with a speech impediment (like all announcers) struggles to read a bulletin and hands it to the ballerina wearing the most grotesque mask and heaviest weights. She begins reading in her natural, beautiful voice before switching to a more unpleasant one; it would be unfair for her to use such a beautiful voice. Harrison&#x27;s escape from prison is announced, and a full-body photograph of him is shown upright after several tries to face it upright by the showrunners. He is tall and burdened by of handicaps.

George recognizes his son for a moment, before having the thought eliminated by his radio. Harrison storms the TV studio in an attempt to overthrow the government. He declares himself emperor and rips off both of his own handicaps and those of the ballerina who previously read the news bulletin, who elects to be his empress when given the option. Bergeron then orders the present musicians within the television studio to play their best music while the two of them dance. 

Suddenly, the Handicapper General bursts into the studio and kills Harrison and the Empress on the spot with two shotgun blasts while they are in the middle of a long kiss. She threatens the musicians at gunpoint to put on their handicaps again before the TV goes dark. George, who left to get a beer, returns. He asks Hazel why she is crying, to which she replies that something sad happened on television that she cannot remember.

==Characters==
*Harrison Bergeron is the fourteen-year-old son of George Bergeron and Hazel Bergeron, who is tall, a genius, and an extraordinarily handsome, athletic, strong, and brave person. 
*George Bergeron is Harrison&#x27;s father and Hazel&#x27;s husband. A very smart and sensitive character, he is handicapped artificially by the government. 
*Hazel Bergeron is Harrison&#x27;s mother and George&#x27;s wife. Hazel has what is described as perfectly average intelligence, which means that she cannot think deeply about anything. 
*The Ballerina, a beautiful dancer who was burdened with an especially ugly mask and excessive weights, as she is the fairest, most beautiful and most graceful of the dancers. 
*Diana Moon Glampers is the Handicapper General. Vonnegut re-used the name for a character in &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
The story has been adapted for the screen several times.

*PBS adapted several stories, including &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, in &quot;Between Time and Timbuktu&quot; (1972), with Avind Haerum in the title role.
*In 1995, Showtime produced a full-length made-for-television adaptation entitled &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot;, starring Sean Astin as the title character and Christopher Plummer as John Klaxon. The adaptation diverged from the plot considerably, featuring Harrison being recruited by the National Administration Center, a secret cabal of geniuses within the government who ensure that the handicapped America functions. Working for the television division, Harrison becomes dissatisfied with the status quo and attempts to start another American revolution by taking over the nation&#x27;s television broadcasting. He broadcasts old unhandicapped movies and music, while encouraging people to remove the brain-handicapping &quot;bands&quot; on their heads.
*In 2006, a short film also entitled &quot;Harrison Bergeron&quot; was released.
*In 2009, another short film called &quot;2081&quot; was based on the original story and starred Armie Hammer as Harrison Bergeron. Joe Crowe, managing editor of the online magazine &quot;Revolution Science Fiction&quot;, described the movie as &quot;stirring and dramatic&quot; and said it &quot;gets right to the point, and nails the adaptation in about 25 minutes.&quot;
*In 2024, an &quot;acoustic&quot; adaptation of Harrison Bergeron was produced for radio and streaming audiences by audio producer and documentarian, Greg Barron. It was published on sounddawg.net, strictly adhering to the original story text to create a new storytelling experience tailored to audio media.

== Cultural references ==
In 2005, the story was quoted by attorneys in a brief before the Kansas Supreme Court. Vonnegut was quoted as saying that while he did not mind the story being used in the suit, he disagreed with the lawyers&#x27; interpretation of it.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia quoted the story in &quot;PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin&quot;.

A 2013 academic paper criticizing the new hyperandrogenism policies of the International Association of Athletics Federations and the International Olympic Committee was entitled &quot;The Harrison Bergeron Olympics&quot; and several non-academics had similar criticisms.

<doc id="189414" wikidata="Q174249" url="?curid=189414" title="Minamoto no Sanetomo">
<text>was the third &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate. He was the second son of the Kamakura shogunate founder, Minamoto no Yoritomo. His mother was Hōjō Masako and his older brother was the second Kamakura shogun Minamoto no Yoriie.

His childhood name was . He was the last head of the Minamoto clan of Japan. His Dharma name was .

He was an accomplished &quot;waka&quot; poet.

== Early life ==
After the death of Yoritomo in 1199, Sanetomo&#x27;s maternal grandfather Hōjō Tokimasa usurped the political and military power of the Shogunate, relegating the position and title of &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot;, or &quot;shōgun&quot;, to a figurehead. Through hereditary succession, Sanetomo&#x27;s older brother Yoriie became &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot; in 1202, only to be stripped of the title a year later and put under house arrest for plotting against the Hōjō clan. This was presumably to keep the &quot;shōgun&quot; a child and thus needing a regent (&quot;shikken&quot;) to make decisions in his place. Shortly thereafter, in 1203, Sanetomo became head of the Minamoto clan and was appointed &quot;Sei-i Taishōgun&quot;.

A year later, Yoriie was assassinated by the Hōjō. Sanetomo was never more than a puppet for his mother Hōjō Masako and maternal uncle Hōjō Yoshitoki, who used him as a pawn in their war with their father Tokimasa; Tokimasa tried to depose his grandson a number of times, beginning in 1205, causing Sanetomo to fear for his life thereafter.

=== &quot;Waka&quot; poet ===
Sanetomo, understanding his own powerlessness and not wanting to meet the same fate as his elder brother, put his time and energy into writing waka poetry and gaining posts within the powerless but honorary imperial court. Sanetomo was a talented poet, writing over 700 poems between the age 17 and 22 while he was tutored by Fujiwara no Teika. He published his private waka collection &quot;Kinkai Wakashū&quot;, even having one of his tanka included in the anthology &quot;Ogura Hyakunin Isshu&quot; (&quot;100 Poems by 100 Poets&quot;), a collection of Japanese poems of the Heian and early Kamakura periods. Sanetomo reached the third-highest post of the imperial court, &quot;Udaijin&quot; (Minister of the Right or &quot;vice-premier&quot;) in 1218.

Eventually, Sanetomo lapsed into inactivity and despair, plagued by fear of assassination and tormented by his chronic alcoholism (an addiction which Priest Eisai once tried to break by replacing alcohol with tea).

=== Death ===


Under heavy snow on the evening of February 13, 1219 (&quot;Jōkyū 1, 27th day of the 1st month&quot;), Sanetomo was coming down from the Senior Shrine at Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū after participating in a ceremony celebrating his nomination to Udaijin. His nephew and son of deposed Yoriie, Kugyō, came out from beside the stone stairway of the shrine and assassinated him. For his act, he was himself beheaded a few hours later, thus bringing the Seiwa Genji line of the Minamoto clan and their rule in Kamakura to a sudden end.

Minamoto no Sanetomo was succeeded by Kujō Yoritsune, son-in-law of Yoriie, as fourth &quot;shōgun&quot; of the Kamakura shogunate.

<doc id="189416" wikidata="Q80021" url="?curid=189416" title="Daugavpils">
<text>Daugavpils (see also other names) is a state city in southeastern Latvia, located on the banks of the Daugava River, from which the city derives its name. The parts of the city to the north of the river belong to the historical Latvian region of Latgale, and those to the south lie in Selonia. It is the second-largest city in the country after the capital Riga, which is located some northwest and is the ninth most populous city in the Baltic states.

Daugavpils is located relatively close to Belarus and Lithuania (distances of and , respectively), and some from the Latvian border with Russia. Daugavpils is a major railway junction and industrial centre, and was an historically important garrison city lying approximately midway between Riga and Minsk, and between Warsaw and Saint Petersburg.

Daugavpils, then called Dyneburg, was the capital of Polish Livonia while in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the first partition of Poland in 1772, the city became part of the Russian Empire. Since the Second World War, it has maintained an overwhelmingly Russian-speaking population, with Latvians and Poles being significant minorities. Historically, German and Yiddish were additional prominent native languages.

==Names==
In the Latvian language, the current name &quot;Daugavpils&quot; () references &quot;Daugava&quot; and the Latvian word &quot;pils&quot; (meaning &quot;castle&quot; - cognate with Lithuanian &quot;pilis&quot;, with Greek &quot;polis&quot; and with Old Prussian &quot;pils&quot;).

Historically, several names in various languages have identified Daugavpils. Some are still in use today.

* (); historically (), ()
* 
* 
* 
* , sometimes 
* (&quot;Daugavpils&quot;) ; historically: (), (), (), ()

===Chronology of name changes===
* Dünaburg (1275–1656)
* Borisoglebov (1656–1667)
* Dünaburg (1667–1893)
* Dvinsk (1893–1920)
* Daugavpils (since 1920)

==History==
The town&#x27;s history began in 1275 when the Livonian Order, led by Ernst von Ratzeburg, built Dünaburg Castle up the Daugava river from where Daugavpils is now situated. In 1281–1313 the castle was ruled by Lithuania . In 1561 it again became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and, subsequently, of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569 (see Duchy of Livonia). In 1621 Daugavpils became the capital of the newly formed Inflanty Voivodeship, which existed until the First Partition of Poland (1772). In 1577 the Russian tsar Ivan the Terrible captured and destroyed Dünaburg castle.

That same year, a new castle and a town were built downriver, by the Polish King and the Grand Duke of Lithuania Stephen Báthory. In 1582 Daugavpils was granted Magdeburg town rights. In 1654, Russia invaded Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, seizing much of the eastern lands. Russian troops besieged Daugavpils in April and May 1655, but did not capture the city; it was only taken by Swedish troops on July 11, 1655, who invaded Poland at that time. When the Russo-Swedish war started, the Russians captured Daugavpils on 10 August 1656, renamed the town &quot;Borisoglebov&quot; and controlled the region for 11 years, between 1656 and 1667. Russia returned the area of Latgale to Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth following the Treaty of Andrusovo (1667). Called Dyneburg, the city became the capital of the Inflanty Voivodeship, also known as the Duchy of Livonia, and the starostwo of Dyneburg. It was a place of local sejmik&#x27;s gatherings. Roman Catholic Bishop of Inflanty, who was always residing outside of diocese, moved his seat to Dyneburg at the end of 17th century. At the end of the 18th century, 540 people lived in the city itself, but counting the population of the suburbs the number was 1,373.

It became part of the Russian Empire after the First Partition of Poland in 1772. It was the uyezd administrative center as part of the Pskov Governorate (1772-1776), Polotsk (1776-1796), Belarusian (1796-1802), and finally Vitebsk (1802-1917), first as Dinaburg, then Dvinsk later during Russian rule.

From 1784 onwards, the city had a large and active Jewish population, among them a number of prominent figures. According to the Russian census of 1897, out of a total population of 69,700, Jews numbered 32,400 (ca. 44% percent).

The construction of the Daugavpils fortress began in 1810 and was completed in 1878. The new centre of the city was built southeast of the fortress in the 19th century according to the project endorsed in St. Petersburg in 1826. The city was located on the Saint Petersburg-Warsaw railway line, to which it was connected in 1860.

As part of the Russian Empire, the city was called &quot;Dvinsk&quot; from 1893 to 1920. The newly independent Latvian state renamed it &quot;Daugavpils&quot; in 1920. Latvians, Poles and Soviet troops fought the Battle of Daugavpils in the area from 1919 to 1920. Daugavpils and the whole of Latvia was under Soviet rule between 1940–41 and 1944–1991. Nazi Brandenburgers led the German attack against the town in 1941, speaking Russian and wearing Soviet uniforms, and Germany occupied it between 1941 and 1944. The Nazis established the Daugavpils Ghetto where the town&#x27;s Jews were forced to live. Most were murdered. During the Cold War the Lociki air-base operated northeast of Daugavpils itself. In the late Soviet era, there was a proposal to build a hydroelectric power station on the Daugava river that was successfully opposed by the nascent environmental movement in Latvia.

On 16 April 2010 an assassin shot vice-mayor Grigorijs Ņemcovs in the center of the city. He died almost immediately and the crime remains unsolved.

===Jewish history===
Prior to 1941, Daugavpils, called Dvinsk by its Jewish inhabitants, was home to the most prominent Jewish community in eastern Latvia. The city was already a Jewish center as early as the 1780s and by the time of the 1897 census, they numbered 32,400 (44% of the overall population of the city). The Jews of the town were very prosperous and ran 32 factories and there were 4000 artisans among them. By 1911 they had increased to 50,000. However, tens of thousands of Jews migrated away from Daugavpils; in the last census taken prior to the Second World War, in 1935, the Jewish population of Daugavpils numbered only 11,106 (24.6% of the overall population of the city).

The city not only boasted a large Jewish population but a rich religious culture including 40 synagogues. The city was home to two of the most prominent rabbis of their time: Joseph Rosen (1858–1936), known as the Rogatchover Gaon (genius from Rahachow), was famed for his commentaries on the works of Maimonides and on the Talmud. Famed for his acidic wit and penetrating genius, he led the towns Hasidic Jews. His &#x27;competitor&#x27;, the leader of the local Misnagdim (non-Hasidic Jews) was the Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk (1843–1926). Rabbi Meir Simcha was also renowned for his work on Maimonides (Or Somayach) as well as Bible commentary Meshech Chochma. In one famous comment he predicted that since some Jews had assimilated and viewed Berlin as their &#x27;Jerusalem&#x27; they would suffer persecution originating in Berlin.

Sarah Azariahu was born here in 1873. She was a leading figure in establishing equal rights for women in pre-state Israel.
Another famous Jewish resident, moving in a very different direction, was the abstract expressionist painter Mark Rothko. Born in Daugavpils in 1903 he immigrated at the age of 10 to the United States where he painted over 800 paintings in his unique style.

Rothko and many of his fellow Jews would have taken the train from Daugavpils to Libau, travelling westwards from Radviliškis on the Libau-Romny Railway, and would have crossed the seas by one of the steamships departing for New York via a regular service established in 1906 by the Russian American Line.

Jewish Daugavpils, a 16,000 strong community, already greatly diminished by emigration, came to an end following the Nazi German invasion on 26 June 1941. Falsely claiming that the Jews had conspired to set fire to the town and that they were assisting the Soviet army, the Germans and their Latvian collaborators carried out large executions on 28–29 June. During July the Jews were enslaved and forced to cut down timber. On 7–11 July Einsatzkommando 1b under Erich Ehrlinger executed many of the remaining Jews. Later in July the 14,000 remaining Jews were forced into a Ghetto along with those from nearby towns. By the end of August an additional 7000 Jews had died at the hands of the Nazis and the local Latvian collaborators. The largest execution took place in November 1941 and was followed by plagues that decimated the few survivors. Only about 1500 Jews remained in the city. These were murdered on 1 May 1942. When the town was liberated in 1944 only 100 survivors remained of a community of 16,000. For more on the Holocaust in Daugavpils see Daugavpils Ghetto.

In Daugavpils 85% of the voters supported the proposal to make Russian the second state language in the 2012 referendum.
Back in 1930 Daugavpils was one of the most ethnically diverse cities in Europe, with no ethnic group making up more than 30% of the total:

More than 1,000 teachers and engineers graduate from the University of Daugavpils (formerly Daugavpils Pedagogical University) and the local branch of Riga Technical University annually.
There is also a Polish gymnasium (academic secondary school) on Varšavas iela (Warsaw Street).

===Historical centre===
The historical centre of Daugavpils city is an architectural heritage of national importance (the construction work was carried out in the 19th century according to the project endorsed in St Petersburg in 1826).
The historical centre is the greatest attraction of the city and one of the most successful examples of balancing the aspects of ancient and modern times. Daugavpils is one of the few cities in Latvia which can pride itself on a unified ensemble of both classic and eclectic styles. The cultural heritage of architectural, artistic, industrial, and historical monuments combined with the picturesque surroundings create the essence of Daugavpils’ image and endow it with a special charm.

In 2020, the municipality allocated 70,000 euros for the restoration of eight historical buildings, including Art Nouveau and red brick buildings.

There are also several architectural, historical, and cultural monuments in Daugavpils. The most prominent are:

* Daugavpils fortress - built in the years 1810-1878, after the decree of Tsar Alexander I of Russia. In April 2013 the Mark Rothko Art centre was opened in the fortress. Formerly, the fortress hosted also the Baroque Daugavpils Jesuit Church, but it was destroyed in 1944 and the ruins were demolished in 1950s.
* St. Peter-in-Chains Catholic Church - the oldest preserved church in the city, built in 1845-1848 and rebuilt in 1924-1934.
* Alexander Nevsky Cathedral - Orthodox church built in 1999-2003 in place of the old Orthodox cathedral, which was built in 1856-1864 and destroyed in 1969.
* Daugavpils Synagogue - built in 1850
* Church Hill (Baznīci kalnas) - place where the churches of four christian denominations are located next to each other: Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, Martin Luther Cathedral, Ss. Boris and Gleb Cathedral and First Old Believers’ House of Prayer.
* Daugavpils Theatre - built in 1937-1938 by Verners Vitands and restored in 2007.
* Socialist realist buildings of the Daugavpils railway station and the University of Daugavpils
* Daugavpils Regional Studies and Art Museum

===Red brick buildings===

Daugavpils is exceptionally rich in red brick buildings. This style was developed by many outstanding architects. In Daugavpils, this variety of eclecticism is most widely represented in the buildings designed by Wilhelm Neumann, an architect of German origin who was the chief architect of the city from 1878 to 1895. Bright examples of brick architecture are the buildings at 1/3 Saules Street and at 8 Muzeja Street. The shape-forming techniques typical of eclecticism that were applied in the façades of these buildings even many decades later make one appreciate and admire the striking accuracy of detail.

==Transport==
&quot;Daugavpils satiksme AS&quot; oversees the city&#x27;s bus and tram networks.

The city&#x27;s railway station is the terminus of the Riga–Daugavpils Railway.

A former Soviet Air Force base is located at Lociki northeast of downtown Daugavpils with the potential to be redeveloped as a civilian or military/civilian airport, although no plans have come to fruition Griva Airfield is located 4 km NW of Daugavpils, next to the river. It&#x27;s movements mainly involve parachute jumping and paragliding.

==Government==

The head of the city government is the mayor of Daugavpils or, literally, &#x27;Council Chairman&#x27; (&quot;domes priekšsēdētājs&quot;). The incumbent since January 2021 is Andrejs Elksniņš, an independent formerly of the Harmony party. It is his third term in office, his initial term was ended after the coalition broke apart in September 2017 less than a month following the 2017 municipal elections and he was succeeded by of the Latvian Green Party (elected on the &quot;Our Party&quot; electoral list). &quot;Our Party&quot; governed in coalition with the Latgale Party of the previous mayor Jānis Lāčplēsis. Eigims was previously mayor from 2001–2003 as leader of the Light of Latgale party and briefly in 2009 as a member of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party.

The Council consists of 15 members who are elected every four years. The most recent election was in 2021.

==Economy==

Industry is important and local employers include the Daugavpils Locomotive Repair Plant (&quot;Daugavpils Lokomotīvju Remonta Rūpnīca&quot;), the Ditton Driving Chain Factory (&quot;Ditton pievadķēžu rūpnīca&quot;), &quot;DAUER&quot; group of metalworks, &quot;Latvijas Maiznieks&quot; commercial bakery, &quot;Ziegler GmbH&quot; machine works, &quot;Axon&quot; cable assembly plant, &quot;Nexis Fibers&quot; industrial yarn, &quot;Latgales alus SIA&quot; brewery and &quot;Fores&quot;, a manufacturer of windows and interior wood fittings.

The chemical industry was well developed during the Soviet era and largely disappeared after the return to capitalism in the 1990s. The &quot;Dauteks&quot; synthetic fibre plant was one of the largest in the USSR and was the second largest industrial employer in Latvia. The Ķīmija suburb built to house it&#x27;s workers in the 1960s was named after the plant. It was owned by the French company Rhodia in the early 2000s before closing entirely. A number of tax incentives exist to attract new industrial investment to eastern Latvia.

==Sports==
The Speedway Grand Prix of Latvia is currently held at the Latvijas Spīdveja Centrs with America&#x27;s triple World Champion Greg Hancock being the most successful rider in Latvia winning the GP in 2009, 2009 and 2013.

<text>Modesty Blaise is a British comic strip featuring a fictional character of the same name, created by author Peter O&#x27;Donnell and illustrator Jim Holdaway in 1963. The strip follows Modesty Blaise, an exceptional young woman with many talents and a criminal past, and her trusty sidekick Willie Garvin. It was adapted into films in 1966, 1982, and 2003, and from 1965 onwards, 11 novels and two short-story collections were written.

==Fictional character biography==

In 1945, a nameless girl escapes from a displaced person (DP) camp in Kalyros, Greece. She remembers nothing from her short past and wanders through post-World War II Mediterranean, the Middle East, and regions of North Africa, where she learns to survive the hard way. She befriends Lob, another wandering refugee, who is a Jewish Hungarian scholar from Budapest. He gives her an education and a first name: Modesty. Sometime later, Modesty chooses her last name, Blaise, after Merlin&#x27;s tutor from the Arthurian legends. When Lob dies is unclear, other than it being prior to her going to Tangier. &quot;The Xanadu Talisman&quot; mentions that Modesty has left Lob at a village to recover from a wound; she goes alone to sell a car tyre. In 1953, she takes control of a criminal gang in Tangier from Henri Louche and expands it into an international organization called the Network.

During the years that she runs the Network, she meets Willie Garvin. Despite his desperate lifestyle, she sees his potential and offers him a job. Inspired by her belief in him, he pulls through as her right-hand man in the Network and becomes Modesty&#x27;s most trusted friend. Theirs is a strictly platonic relationship, based on mutual respect and shared interests. He always calls her &quot;Princess&quot;, a form of address only he is allowed to use. Other members of the Network call Modesty &quot;Mam&#x27;selle&quot; (as in the French term &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; or &quot;Miss&quot;). Though their relationship has no sexual element, Modesty&#x27;s various lovers invariably treat Willie with frustrated envy, as he is the only man who remains vital to her life, while lovers come and go. By the same token, some of Willie&#x27;s girlfriends are initially jealous of Modesty, but later come to understand how the dynamic between them works (as in the case of Lady Janet).

She obtains British nationality by marrying for convenience and divorcing an Englishman in Beirut; the husband (James Turner) dies a year later of alcoholism. Having made a point of not dealing in secrets belonging to H.M. government, when she feels she has made enough money, she retires and moves to England and Willie Garvin follows suit. Bored by their new lives among the idle rich, they accept a request for assistance from Sir Gerald Tarrant, a high-ranking official of the British Secret Service. This is where the story really begins, although it is treated differently in the first comic strip and the first book. Modesty&#x27;s fortune is estimated at £500,000 as of 1963 (over £8.84 million in 2020). She lives in a penthouse in London overlooking Hyde Park, and also owns a villa in Tangier and a cottage two miles from Benildon, Wiltshire. She is 5 feet 6 inches (168 cm) tall and weighs 120 lb (54 kg) as revealed in &quot;La Machine&quot;.

Many of her adventures are based on capers in which Willie Garvin and she become involved as a result of their association with Tarrant. However, they may also help perfect strangers or fight various eccentric villains in exotic locations of their own volition if the cause fits their values; &quot;ghosts&quot; from their Network past also emerge to haunt them from time to time. Although Modesty and Willie do not hesitate to kill if necessary, they avoid deadly force whenever possible, often relying upon their extraordinary physical combat and weapons skills. There are many occasions in the comic strip and novels where the two decide ahead of time - with the final say up to Modesty - whether to use deadly force (&quot;for keeps&quot;) or less-lethal methods (&quot;for sleeps&quot;) depending on the level of the perceived threat. 
In Willie and Modesty&#x27;s fights, great emphasis is placed on unarmed combat and unusual weapons. Modesty&#x27;s weapon of choice is a &quot;kongo&quot; or yawara stick (which she often disguises either tied up in her hair or as a detachable clasp on her handbag), and as for firearms she begins by preferring the Colt .32 revolver and Mab Brevete .32 ACP auto pistol, although in later books, she switches to carrying a Star PD .45 auto pistol. Willie&#x27;s preferred weapon is the throwing knife, of which he usually carries two. Many other strange weapons (such as the quarterstaff, &quot;épée&quot;, blowgun, and sling) and unexpected fighting techniques are also featured.

In keeping with the &quot;floating timeline&quot; spirit of other long-running comic strip and literary characters, Modesty and Willie generally do not age over the decades, with Modesty always being depicted as being in her late 20s and Willie eight years older. The only exceptions to this rule occur in the comic strip origin story, &quot;In the Beginning&quot;; the 1996 short-story collection &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;, the final Modesty Blaise book, which contains five stories that take place where Modesty&#x27;s age moves from 20 to 52 (approximately); and the 2003 film &quot;My Name Is Modesty&quot;, which is a prequel depicting Modesty in her late teens.

==Comic strip==
Having conceived the idea after a chance meeting with a girl during his wartime service in the Middle East, O&#x27;Donnell elected to work with Jim Holdaway, with whom he had worked on the strip &quot;Romeo Brown&quot;, after a trial period of collaboration with Frank Hampson, creator of &quot;Dan Dare&quot;, left O&#x27;Donnell dissatisfied. &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; debuted in the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; on 13 May 1963. The strip was syndicated among a large number of newspapers ranging from the &quot;Johannesburg Star&quot; to the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, the &quot;Bombay Samachar&quot;, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; (Calcutta, India), &quot;The Star&quot; (Malaysia), &quot;The West Australian&quot; (Perth), &quot;The Evening Citizen&quot; (Glasgow, Scotland) and the &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot; (Birmingham, England).

After Jim Holdaway&#x27;s sudden death in 1970, the art of the strip was provided by Spanish artist Enrique Badía Romero. Eight years later, Romero quit to make time for his own comics projects, and after short attempts by John Burns and Patrick Wright, Neville Colvin drew the strip until 1986. Then Romero returned to the job and continued until the end of the strip.

The strip&#x27;s circulation in the United States was erratic, in part because of the occasional nude scenes, which were much less acceptable in the US than elsewhere, resulting in a censored version of the strip being circulated. (Modesty occasionally used a tactic that she called the &quot;Nailer,&quot; in which she appeared topless, distracting the bad guys long enough to give Willie or herself a chance to incapacitate them.) An example of this censorship appears in the introduction to the 2007 Titan Books reprint volume &quot;Death Trap&quot;, which illustrated two segments of the story arc, &quot;The Junk Men&quot; that were censored by the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; when it published the strip in 1977; in both cases a screen was drawn over scantily clad images of Willie and Modesty. Reportedly, O&#x27;Donnell did not approve of the changes, although they were made by the artist, Romero.
The final &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; strip ran in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; on 11 April 2001. Some of the newspapers that carried the series, feeling that it had become a tradition for their readers, began running it again from the beginning. O&#x27;Donnell, to give Romero some additional work, gave the artist permission to adapt one of his short stories (&quot;The Dark Angels&quot;) as a comic that was published in the Scandinavian anthology magazine &quot;Agent X9&quot; in 2002, later being reprinted in the US in a special issue of &quot;Comics Revue&quot;.

From 1 December 2008, the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, which had stopped including comic strips for some time, republished &quot;La Machine&quot;, using the original artwork. Following a change of ownership of the paper, they did not continue with subsequent stories.

=== Strip numbering ===
The ordinary strips are consecutive numbered from 1 to 10183. Outside this numbering are the two newspaper stories &quot;In the Beginning&quot; and &quot;The Killing Ground&quot; and the two comic-book stories &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; and &quot;The Dark Angels&quot;.

Outside the ordinary numbering is also a quantity of A-strips. An A-strip has the same number as the previous strip, but followed by an A. They were used on days when not all the newspapers running &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; were published. An A-strip is not vital for the continuity of the story and is often just supplementing the previous strip.

The first A-strip was 194A and was published during Christmas 1963 in Scottish newspapers.

Since December 1974, &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; has not been published on Saturdays. So, since then, and the story &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;, a sixth of the strips have been A-strips and have not had their premiere in &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;.

A single strip is numbered with an X suffix, strip number 3641X, and is similar to the A-strips.

== Reprints and comic book adaptations ==
Many reprint editions of the comic strip have appeared over the years, of varying quality. Most reprint the earliest strips, with strips from the 1980s and 1990s being the least often reprinted.

In Sweden the strip has been in continuous distribution since 1971 in a monthly comic adventure magazine called &quot;Agent X9&quot; (previously, Modesty had her own comic magazine &quot;Agent Modesty Blaise&quot; in Sweden from 1967 to 1970). Many of O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s stories premiered here (translated into Swedish), and the magazine continues to run a Modesty Blaise story every month, from the archives. When the daily strip was discontinued, artist Romero was given permission by O&#x27;Donnell to do a final Modesty Blaise story directly for &quot;Agent X9&quot; magazine. The two-parter was published in 2002 and based on an unused script by O&#x27;Donnell entitled &quot;The Dark Angels&quot;, which O&#x27;Donnell had previously adapted for the short story collection &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;. Romero also contributed original painted covers for the &quot;Agent X9&quot; magazine for many years.

In India Modesty has acquired a huge fan base and the stories have been published in various magazines starting in 1971. Modesty was featured in Kalki Magazine (1971), Kumudam Magazine (1972), Muthu Comics (1975), Lion Comics (1984 to date), Rani Comics (1990–2002) &amp; Comic World (1998) in the Tamil language. They were also published in English in Spectrum Comics (1985–1986). Though other magazines stopped/ceased publishing Modesty Blaise, Lion Comics continues to publish her stories regularly. Considering the medium, certain images from the stories were edited to make them suitable for child readers.

One of the earliest reprints in book form occurred in 1978 when Star Books—an imprint of WH Allen Limited—published two paperback-sized compilations of the Holdaway-era stories: 1) &quot;In the Beginning&quot;, &quot;The Black Pearl&quot;, and &quot;The Vikings&quot;, and 2) &quot;La Machine&quot; and &quot;The Long Lever&quot;. These reprints suffered from poor reproduction that rendered many panels illegible.

Between 1981 and 1986, Ken Pierce Books Inc. of the United States, in conjunction with Eclipse Comics, published eight volumes of comic book-sized reprints dubbed the &quot;First American Edition&quot; series. The first four books featured Holdaway-illustrated stories from the 1960s, while the last four featured strips from the early 1980s as illustrated by Neville Colvin. These books also suffered from reproduction problems that resulted in many panels being reprinted too light, making them difficult to read.

In 1994, DC Comics released a graphic novel adaptation of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (the novel), with art by Dan Spiegle and Dick Giordano ().

Manuscript Press published two volumes of late-1980s Romero strips in 2003 (&quot;Live Bait&quot; and &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;); it also published all of the stories not reprinted elsewhere in serialised form in its magazine publications &quot;Comics Revue&quot; and &quot;Modesty Blaise Quarterly&quot;, the former of which, as noted above, also published &quot;The Dark Angels&quot; for the first (and, to date, only) time in English. &quot;Comics Revue&quot; is continuing to reprint Modesty Blaise strips as of 2015, although a planned reprint of &quot;The Dark Angels&quot; in autumn 2014 was cancelled just before publication when the copyright holders withdrew permission.

The American magazine &quot;Comics Revue&quot; also continues to reprint the strip, and remains to date the only publisher to have released an English-language version of &quot;The Dark Angels&quot;.

=== Titan Books old series, 1985–1990 ===
Between 1984 and 1990, Titan Books of England published eight volumes of reprints of strips featuring art by Holdaway and Romero, covering the period 1963 to 1974. All of the covers were drawn by John M. Burns.

=== Titan Books new series, 2004–2017 ===
Beginning in March 2004, Titan launched a new series of reprint volumes. These new versions use larger images and reportedly come from better source material than the editions published between 1984 and 1990.

As well as an introduction to each story by Peter O&#x27;Donnell (books 1 to 16), Lawrence Blackmore (books 17 to 24), Simon Ward (book 25), Rick Norwood (book 26), Rebecca Chance (book 28), and Daphne Alexander and Kate McAll (book 30), most books include articles about the series. The individual story introductions are absent from books 27 and 29.

In October 2017, Titan completed its reprints of the entire newspaper strip run with the final stories from Romero&#x27;s second tenure. It is not yet known if the company has the rights to reprint &quot;The Dark Angels&quot;, a graphic novel-length story that was published in a European magazine after the retirement of the original strip, or the 1994 graphic novel adaptation of the first &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; novel published by DC Comics.

==Story list==
There were 99 storylines produced for the Modesty Blaise comic strip and all its printed forms over almost forty years, and every story was written solely by Peter O&#x27;Donnell. The strips and comic books were drawn by Jim Holdaway (JH), Enrique Badia Romero (ER), John M. Burns (JB), Patrick Wright (PW), Neville Colvin (NC), Dan Spiegle (DS) and Dick Giordano (DG).

===Differences between comic strip and books===
Although the books generally reflect the characters previously established in the comic strip, there are a number of detail differences. One example of this is how Modesty is initially recruited to work for Sir Gerald Tarrant – although the strip story &quot;La Machine&quot; (1963) and the book story &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; (1965) have similarities, and in both Tarrant achieves his aim by putting her under an obligation, in the strip story this relates to the validity of her marriage (and therefore her right to British nationality and residence) while in the book he provides her with information that enables her to rescue Willie Garvin and save his life. The name of her husband is given in the strip, with the marriage taking place in 1960 and him dying in 1961; in the novel he is unnamed and the marriage took place in 1962. The novels also include a more overt fantasy element than the strip, with characters demonstrating clairvoyant abilities in several novels (including Willie&#x27;s trademark ability to predict trouble when he feels his ears prickling, a trait also demonstrated in the comic), and a later story referencing the afterlife.

There are also cases where characters first appear in the books and then subsequently appear in the comic strip – Steve Collier first appears in &quot;I, Lucifer&quot; (1967) and his future wife Dinah in &quot;A Taste for Death&quot; (1969) but they do not appear in the strip until &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; (1989).

==Modesty Blaise Quarterly==

&quot;Comics Revue presents Modesty Blaise&quot; was a small press magazine sized comic book published by Manuscript Press which reprinted Modesty Blaise comic strip stories by O&#x27;Donnell and illustrated by the artists Jim Holdaway (JH), Enrique Badia Romero (ER), John M. Burns (JB), Patrick Wright (PW), Neville Colvin (NC). It published 25 issues between 1995 and 2000. With issue 23, all the MB stories had been reprinted in either &quot;Comics Revue presents Modesty Blaise&quot; or &quot;Comics Revue&quot;, so the contents of the last two issues was decided by reader vote. Issue 24 carried &quot;The Galley Slaves&quot; and 25 reprinted &quot;Butch Cassidy Rides Again&quot;.

== In other media ==
===Films===
After the initial popularity of the comic strip British Lion Films announced a &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; film to be written by Sidney Gilliat that was never made.

A film titled &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, loosely based on the comic strip, was filmed in 1966 as a comedy thriller. It was directed by Joseph Losey and starred Monica Vitti as Modesty, Terence Stamp as Willie Garvin, and Dirk Bogarde as Gabriel. Peter O&#x27;Donnell wrote the first draft of the screenplay for the film, but the script was heavily revised by others before shooting began, and the finished film bore very little resemblance to O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s vision in tone, theme, or characterisation. For example, a romance is established between Willie and Modesty, even though the comic strip firmly established only a platonic relationship between them. The film also incorporated several musical numbers. One sequence of the film establishes that the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; comic strip exists within the fictional universe of the film and is based upon the exploits of Vitti&#x27;s character, who is seen dressing up as the illustrated version of herself. The film was unsuccessful.

In 1982, a one-hour pilot was made for a proposed &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; television series, starring Ann Turkel as Modesty Blaise and Lewis Van Bergen as Willie Garvin. The film aired on the ABC Network to positive reviews, but no series resulted. This was a slightly more serious version of the stories than the campy 1966 comedy version. In this pilot the setting is moved from London to Hollywood, and both Willie and Tarrant are portrayed as Americans; Modesty&#x27;s nationality is left unrevealed but Turkel also plays her with an American accent.

In 2003, a direct-to-video film titled &quot;My Name Is Modesty&quot; was released under the &quot;Quentin Tarantino Presents...&quot; banner. The film was directed by Scott Spiegel and starred English actress Alexandra Staden as Modesty Blaise (to date the only British actress to play the role on screen). Although promoted as the first of a series, no others were made. One immediately noticeable difference between the film and the source material is that it is a prequel to Modesty&#x27;s established backstory as a crime boss; as such, the character of Willie Garvin is omitted.

Quentin Tarantino has been interested in directing a &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; film for many years, and at one point Neil Gaiman wrote a script treatment based upon O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s novel, &quot;I, Lucifer&quot;. So far, nothing has come of these plans. Tarantino &quot;sponsored&quot; the release of &quot;My Name Is Modesty&quot; by allowing it to be released under the label &quot;Quentin Tarantino presents ...&quot; In the Tarantino film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Vincent Vega is seen reading a copy of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;.
Nicole Kidman has also gone on record as being interested in making a &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; film, and Jennifer Lopez was reported to be pitching for the part in 2003.

===Novels and short story collections===
O&#x27;Donnell was invited to write a novelization of the 1966 film. The novel, released a year before the film itself and based on his original screenplay for the movie, fared considerably better than the film. During the following decades he would write a total of eleven Modesty Blaise novels and two collections of short stories. Several of the short stories either adapt comic strip stories, or would later be adapted into comic strip stories themselves. Characters cross over between the two media. Except for &quot;Pieces of Modesty&quot;, initially published as a Pan Books paperback, the books were originally issued in hardback (by Souvenir Press) and have subsequently gone through numerous paperback editions, with Pan the primary paperback publisher in the U.K. until the late 1970s.

O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s final book, &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;, is a short story collection. Intended by O&#x27;Donnell to be his literary finale, the final story depicts the deaths of Modesty and Willie (with an implied afterlife). O&#x27;Donnell, however, would continue to write the comic strip for several more years, and chose to end it on a more optimistic note, though the comic strip&#x27;s finale does not contradict the prose version.

Beginning in the early 2000s (decade), Souvenir Press began a series of paperback reprints of the Modesty Blaise book series, using the first edition hardback covers, and originally concluding with a reprint of &quot;Cobra Trap&quot; in 2006. Souvenir subsequently gained the rights to the short story collection &quot;Pieces of Modesty&quot; and issued their reprint of that book in March 2010, with a new cover design based on the original hardback cover from the first Modesty novel, at which point all the Blaise books fell under the same UK publisher for the first time.

In 2008, Penguin Books of India reprinted the full series.

The 2012 Charles Stross book &quot;The Apocalypse Codex&quot; is, according to the author, a tribute to Modesty Blaise.

===Audio formats===
&quot;Last Day in Limbo&quot; was adapted as a BBC World Service six-part radio drama in 1978 with Barbara Kellerman as Modesty, James Bolam as Willie and Richard Vernon as Tarrant.

&quot;I Had a Date with Lady Janet&quot; (the short story from &quot;Pieces of Modesty&quot;) was published as an audio tape reading by Pickwick Talking Books in the early 1980s, featuring John Thaw as Willie (the story, uniquely to the canon, is a first-person tale told from Willie Garvin&#x27;s point of view).

BBC Radio 4 has broadcast adaptations of three of the books in their &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot; slot, each in five fifteen-minute episodes, adapted by Stef Penney and produced/directed by Kate McAll, starring Daphne Alexander as Modesty, with music by Will Gregory, arranged by Ian Gardiner.

&quot;A Taste for Death&quot; was originally broadcast from 17 to 21 December 2012, featuring Carl Prekopp as Willie and Alun Armstrong as Tarrant, with Sam Dale (Simon Delicata), Geoffrey Streatfeild (Steve Collier), Samantha Dakin (Dinah Pilgrim), Alex Fearns (McWhirter), Jeff Mash (Skeet Lowery) and Nigel Anthony (Sir Howard Presteign).

&quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; was originally broadcast from 16 to 20 June 2014, featuring Neil Maskell as Willie and Alun Armstrong as Tarrant, with Ewan Bailey (Gabriel), Alex Fearns (McWhirter), Matthew Gravelle, John Hollingworth and Hannah Pakeman.

&quot;The Silver Mistress&quot; was originally broadcast from 13 to 17 February 2017, featuring Paul Bazely as Willie and Ian McNeice as Tarrant, with Clare Grogan (Clare), Ewan Bailey (Sexton/Colonel Jim), Sara Markland (Lady Janet/Angel) and John Ramm (Quinn).

== References to Modesty Blaise in other popular culture ==
* The theme song &quot;&quot;Modesty (Modesty Blaise Theme)&quot; from the Losey movie was sung by David and Jonathan, with music composed by John Dankworth and lyrics by Benny Green.

* The theme song appeared in instrumental form as a mambo by Latin jazz composer and vibist Cal Tjader and collaborator Eddie Palmieri on their 1966 album El Sonido Nuevo (The New Sound). 
* Rock group Sparks wrote and recorded a song intended as the theme tune for the aborted TV series. Using an amended title &quot;Modesty Plays&quot;&quot; to avoid trademark infringement, it was released originally in 1982 as a France-only single and subsequently in a new version on their 1986 album &quot;Music That You Can Dance To&quot;. Singer Russell Mael admits that he is actually singing &quot;Blaise&quot; not &quot;Plays&quot;.
* Closterkeller, a Polish Gothic band, recorded the song &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; on their 1992 album &quot;Blue&quot;, based on the Modesty Blaise character.

== Controversy ==
On 29 June 2020 strip no. 2548 drew controversy from readers of &quot;The West Australian&quot; newspaper for its dialogue, in which the villain in the story used offensive language to refer to Indigenous Australians. Strip no. 2548 and the associated story &quot;The Stone Age Caper&quot;, has a villain who makes racist statements. The story had previously been published by the newspaper in 2009. At that time, the only complaint about the story was that in one panel Modesty is shown topless. On 30 June 2020 the newspaper made a decision that, after 48 years, it would cease publishing &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;.

<text>Lucia Frederica Rijker (; born December 6, 1967) is a Dutch professional boxer, kickboxer, and actress.

Rijker was sometimes dubbed by the press &quot;The Most Dangerous Woman in the World&quot;.

==Early career==
Rijker was born in Amsterdam to a Surinamese father and a Dutch mother. She speaks four languages and is a Buddhist, dedicating time daily to meditation and chanting.

Rijker started her martial arts career at the early age of six, when she began training in judo. A year later, she was part of the Dutch National Softball Team. At fourteen, after picking up fencing a year earlier, Lucia became the Netherlands Junior Champion of that sport. When she was fifteen she began kickboxing and knocked out the reigning American kickboxing champion, Lily Rodriguez. Rijker eventually amassed a 36-0 (25 KO) record as a kickboxer, and won four different world titles. Her only defeat in a kickboxing ring was in an exhibition match at Sporthallen Zuid in Amsterdam in October 1994, when she fought male Muay Thai fighter Somchai Jaidee, who knocked her out in the second round.

==Career change==
After winning her first 14 fights, but failing to secure a match with Christy Martin, Rijker stepped away from boxing in 1999 to pursue a career in Hollywood. She appeared as Billie &#x27;The Blue Bear&#x27; Osterman in 2004&#x27;s Oscar-winning, female boxer-based film &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; and was featured in the documentary film &quot;Shadow Boxers&quot;. She played a minor role in &quot;Rollerball&quot; and had a brief cameo in the season 2 finale of &quot;The L Word&quot; as Dana&#x27;s trainer. She returned to &quot;The L Word&quot; in Season 5 as Dusty, Helena&#x27;s cellmate in prison. Rijker played a Romulan communications officer in the film &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Return to the ring==

She returned to the ring in February 2002, and later beat Jane Couch (20-4 going in; 25-6 as of December 2004) by decision (eight rounds) on June 21, 2003 for her 16th win. Win number 17 was a ten-round decision over &quot;Sun shine” Fettkether on May 20, 2004.

Rijker and Christy Martin were scheduled to fight on July 30, 2005 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. Major U.S. promoter Bob Arum (Top Rank Boxing&#x27;s head) had made their match the main event of a card (with otherwise male boxing matches) called &quot;Million Dollar Lady&quot;. Each woman was guaranteed $250,000 (U.S.), with the winner receiving an extra $750,000; however, on July 20, it was announced that she had ruptured an Achilles tendon while training for the fight; recovery time was estimated to be 4–7 months. The match was ultimately cancelled.

In 2006, Rijker stated that although not retired as a professional boxer, she would only consider one more fight - a bout with Laila Ali.

==Boxing records==
As of February 2007, she was undefeated in the ring; her boxing record is 17-0 (14 K.O.&#x27;s).

Rijker has been on the cover of numerous magazines including &quot;Inside Kung Fu&quot;. As a professional boxer, she has won the WIBF Welterweight Title, and has beaten name fighters such as Marcela Acuña (5th-round K.O.; Acuña was 0-1 going into the fight, and retired with a record of 42-6-1), and Deborah &quot;Sunshine&quot; Fettkether (10th-round decision; Fettkether was 8-4-3 going in).

==Current activities==
For several years, Rijker has been training under the world-famous boxing coach Freddie Roach. In 2012, she was hired as a striking coach to former UFC Champion Ronda Rousey.

She remains busy giving lectures and seminars to athletes and people from all walks of life to perform their best, while she maintais her top physical form and a strict diet.

Rijker once again gained media attention in June 2013, when she worked in the corner of female boxing challenger Diana Prazak in her WBC super featherweight title bout against local champion Frida Wallberg in Stockholm, Sweden. Prazak knocked Wallberg down twice in the eighth round prompting the referee to stop the fight. After a brief check by the ringside doctor, Wallberg started to collapse in her corner. Rijker immediately realized the seriousness of the situation and called the doctor back to the ring while she and Prazak assisted Wallberg. Wallberg had to be carried from the ring on a stretcher to hospital and underwent surgery with a cerebral hemorrhage. This event sparked controversy about the level of the provided medical attention and reignited debates about banning boxing in Sweden.

In 2014, Rijker was part of the inaugural class of the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

In 2019, Rijker became one of the first three women boxers (and the first Dutch woman boxer) elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame; 2019 was the first year that women were on the ballot.

In 2017, Rijker hosted the Dutch adaptation of Jamie&#x27;s Dream School; as well as in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

<text>Hot dark matter (HDM) is a theoretical form of dark matter which consists of particles that travel with ultrarelativistic velocities.

== Description ==
Dark matter is a form of matter that neither emits nor absorbs light. Within physics, this behavior is characterized by dark matter not interacting with electromagnetic radiation, hence making it &quot;dark&quot; and rendering it undetectable via conventional instruments in physics. 

Data from galaxy rotation curves indicate that approximately 80% of the mass of a galaxy cannot be seen, forcing researchers to innovate ways that &quot;indirectly&quot; detect it through dark matter&#x27;s effects on gravitational fluctuations. 

As we shall see below, it is useful to differentiate dark matter into &quot;hot&quot; (HDM) and &quot;cold&quot; (CDM) types–some even suggesting a middle-ground of &quot;warm&quot; dark matter (WDM). The terminology refers to the mass of the dark matter particles (which dictates the speed at which they travel): HDM travels faster than CDM because the HDM particles are theorized to be of lower mass.

== Role in galaxy formation ==

In terms of its application, the distribution of hot dark matter could also help explain how clusters and superclusters of galaxies formed after the Big Bang. Theorists claim that there exist two classes of dark matter: 

1) those that &quot;congregate around individual members of a cluster of visible galaxies&quot; and 

2) those that encompass &quot;the clusters as a whole.&quot; Because cold dark matter possesses a lower velocity, it could be the source of &quot;smaller, galaxy-sized lumps,&quot; as shown in the image. 

Hot dark matter, then, should correspond to the formation of larger mass aggregates that surround whole galaxy clusters. However, data from the cosmic microwave background radiation, as measured by the COBE satellite, is highly uniform, and such high-velocity hot dark matter particles cannot form clumps as small as galaxies beginning from such a smooth initial state, highlighting a discrepancy in what dark matter theory and the actual data are saying. Theoretically, in order to explain relatively small-scale structures in the observable Universe, it is necessary to invoke cold dark matter or WDM. In other words, hot dark matter being the sole substance in explaining cosmic galaxy formation is no longer viable, placing hot dark matter under the larger umbrella of mixed dark matter (MDM) theory.

== Neutrinos ==
An example of a hot dark matter particle is the neutrino. Neutrinos have very small masses, and do not take part in two of the four fundamental forces, the electromagnetic interaction and the strong interaction. They interact by the weak interaction, and most probably gravity, but due to the feeble strength of these forces, they are difficult to detect. A number of projects, such as the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory, in Gifu, Japan are currently studying these neutrinos.

<doc id="189427" wikidata="Q957900" url="?curid=189427" title="Percivall Pott">
<text>Percivall Pott (6 January 1714, in London – 22 December 1788) was an English surgeon, one of the founders of orthopaedics, and the first scientist to demonstrate that cancer may be caused by an environmental carcinogen, namely chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma. Many diseases are his namesake including Pott&#x27;s fracture, Pott&#x27;s disease of the spine, and Pott&#x27;s puffy tumour. It is believed that Pott&#x27;s standard of living contributed to the rise of the surgeon within social standings.

==Early life and education==
Percivall Pott was born the son of Percivall Pott senior in London. His father died when he was a child, but Joseph Wilcocks, Bishop of Rochester, who was a relative of his mother, paid for his education. He served his apprenticeship with Edward Nourse, assistant surgeon to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, and in 1736 was admitted to the Barbers&#x27; Company and licensed to practice. 

==Career==
He became assistant surgeon to St Bartholomew&#x27;s in 1744 and full surgeon from 1749 till 1787.
As the first surgeon of his day in England, excelling even his pupil, John Hunter, on the practical side, Pott introduced various important innovations in procedure, doing much to abolish the extensive use of escharotics and the cautery that was prevalent when he began his career.

In 1756, Pott sustained a broken leg after a fall from his horse. It is often assumed that his injury was the same one that later came to be known as Pott&#x27;s fracture, but in reality, Pott&#x27;s broken leg was a much more serious compound fracture of the tibia. As he lay in the muck, he sent a servant to buy a door from a nearby construction site, then had himself placed on the door and taken home. Surgeons cleaned the wound and discussed amputation, an operation which at the time had a very high rate of failure, as it often led to sepsis and death, but Pott prevailed on them to splint the leg, and he ultimately recovered completely. 

Percivall Pott&#x27;s dedication to his patients and standard of care garnered Pott high praise and fame. He is generally regarded as one of the two greatest surgeons of the 18th century along with his student John Hunter. 
Amid the patient wards, Pott also honed his writing skills and believed in patient education. He would distribute pamphlets, noting his observations and thoughts on topics ranging from &quot;head injuries, hydrocele, fistula, rupture, and fracture&quot;, in the hospital environment. These pamphlets were in high demand and would sell for more than one shilling and sixpence. Between the 1760s and the 1770s over fourteen of Pott&#x27;s pamphlets were in circulation.

In 1769 Pott published &quot;Some Few Remarks upon Fractures and Dislocations&quot;. The book was translated into French and Italian and had a far-reaching influence in Britain and France. His name was written in the annals of medicine, by first describing arthritic tuberculosis of the spine (Pott&#x27;s disease). He gave an excellent clinical description in his &quot;Remarks on that Kind of Palsy of the Lower Limbs&quot;. Among his other writings, the most noteworthy are &quot;A Treatise on Ruptures&quot; (1756), and &quot;Chirurgical Observations&quot;.

In 1765, he was elected Master of the Company of Surgeons, the forerunner of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.

In 1775, Pott found an association between exposure to soot and a high incidence of scrotal cancer later found to be a type of squamous cell carcinoma in chimney sweeps. This disease, later termed chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma due to Pott&#x27;s investigation, was the first occupational link to cancer, and Pott became the first person to associate a malignancy with an environmental carcinogen, implicating chimney soot as a direct contact carcinogen to skin. 

A manuscript copy of his 1779 lectures on surgery survives as part of the Manchester Medical Manuscripts Collection held by special collections at the University of Manchester Library with the reference MMM/15/2/6.

In 1786, he was honoured as the first Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Shortly after, he retired in 1787 and was named a governor of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital.

== Personal life ==

in 1740, Percivall Pott married Sarah Elizabeth Cruttenden (1725–1811), daughter of the wealthy merchant Robert Cruttenden and his wife Sarah Cliff. They lived together in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in London and had five sons and four daughters, including Joseph Pott, Archdeacon of London, Samuel, a leading newspaper editor and owner of &quot;Saunders Newsletter&quot;, and Mary (Polly), who married the long-serving Irish judge Robert Day.

Although little more is known about Percivall Pott&#x27;s private life, Pott is regularly described as having excellent character, and an archetypical English surgeon. It is believed that Pott&#x27;s standard of living (he was rich enough to give Polly a dowry of £5000) was a contributor to the rise of the surgeon within social standings.

== Chimney sweepers&#x27; carcinoma ==

Percivall Pott has influenced medicine and modern understanding of diseases. Many diseases are his namesake including: Pott&#x27;s fracture, Pott&#x27;s disease of the spine, and Pott&#x27;s puffy tumor. One disease which does not, yet is important to Pott&#x27;s legacy is chimney sweeper&#x27;s carcinoma. Pott quickly recognised the association between carcinoma and chimney sweeps and published his findings in a piece titled &quot;Chirurgical Observations relative to…the cancer of the scrotum.&quot; He wrote that the disease was, &quot; peculiar to a certain sort of people [ and ] which has not at least to my knowledge, been publicly noticed – I mean the chimney-sweepers ’ cancer. The disease, in these people, seems to derive its origin from a lodgment of soot in the rugae of the scrotum.&quot;
=== Discovery and identification credit ===

Scrotal cancer, although largely thought to have been identified by Percivall Pott, had been thought to have been described nearly 40 years before Pott&#x27;s &quot;Chirurgical Observations&quot; as a &quot;canker of privities&quot; per documentation in the burial records of the Parish of St. Botolph without Aldgate from 1589 to 1599. These descriptions are ambiguous and it is unclear which anatomical parts are considered &quot;privities&quot;. As such, most historians generally agree, that Bassius first correctly described scrotal cancer in 1731. Some historians argue that what Bassius considered scrotal cancer was in fact perineal abscesses to the scrotum as opposed to carcinoma. The minority of historians who agree with this fact, attribute the discovery of scrotal cancer to Treyling in 1740.

=== Surgery ===

As a surgeon, Pott was well respected and often assisted fellow surgeons. Pott was viewed as a mentor and even allowed other physicians and surgeons to live with him while under his guidance. Despite the surgical trends of his time, Pott did not agree with severe treatments and heroic medicine but rather preferred gentler forms. Percivall Pott&#x27;s son-in-law, James Earle, described Pott&#x27;s surgery as being &quot;divested of great part of its horrors, became, comparatively, a pleasing study.&quot;

=== Soot and occupational cancer ===

In addition to surgery, Pott&#x27;s focused on public health as well drawing his attention to the challenges of chimney sweeps in his community. He wrote, &quot;in their early infancy, they are most frequently treated with great brutality, and almost starved with cold and hunger; they are thrust up narrow, and sometimes hot chimneys, where they are bruised, burned and almost suffocated; and when they get to puberty, become peculiarly liable to a most noisome, painful, and fatal disease.&quot; Pott&#x27;s approach was unique amongst his contemporaries in that he did not simply note an association but approached chimney sweeps&#x27; carcinoma from a causal perspective. His work helped later identify soot as the disease-causing agent. Pott did not figure this out on his own, but rather pointed research in the right direction. During Pott&#x27;s time, there were many discussions pertaining to the cause of scrotal cancer. James Earle believed that the cancer was caused as a result of the soot entering and residing in the rugae of the scrotum. He famously argued this point based on a trend seen where gardeners who used soot to kill slugs had developed skin carcinoma on their hands. In 1878, George Lawson suggested that the cancer was caused by the friction generated by the chimney sweeper&#x27;s overalls against the scrotum while sifting through soot. This idea was explored by Passey in 1992 who demonstrated that it was the ethereal extract of soot which was capable of inducing sarcoma. Furthermore, Pott also identified that prepubescent boys were most vulnerable to the carcinoma. Pott rose to fame for these connections between occupational hazards and cancer malignancy even though the connection was not fully understood at the time. Pott&#x27;s &quot;Chirurgical Observations&quot; provided a framework to shape the modern understanding of &quot;Occupational cancers.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Percivall Pott&#x27;s work influenced a wave of research and change in public policies. After his initial publication, more clinical cases began to emerge rapidly over the following years. This triggered a series of &quot;Chimney Sweepers&#x27; Acts&quot; which aimed to protect chimney sweepers. These facilitated the formation of societies like the &quot;Society for Superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys, by Encouraging a New Method of Sweeping Chimneys and for Improving the Condition of Children and Others Employed by Chimney Sweepers&quot; in 1803 which included the likes of Dukes, Earls, and Royal Patrons.

Despite the outcry and public demands to change chimney sweeping practices, such as suggesting that young chimney sweeping boys be replaced with mechanical devices, insurance companies, and homeowners argued that Chimney Sweeper&#x27;s carcinoma was a small price to pay for the protection of the mass population against smoke and chimney fires. There was pressure for action as early as 1788, yet it was not until 1875 that Pott&#x27;s work finally began to influence change: in this year a decline in scrotal cancer incidence and mortality was noted.

Latter animal studies (1933) painting coal tar onto skin would demonstrate the role of the first proven chemical carcinogen benzo(a)pyrene, which occurs in high concentrations in smoke and chimney soot, with the process that Pott first identified. Pott&#x27;s early investigations thus contributed to the science of epidemiology and the Chimney Sweepers Act 1788.

<doc id="189429" wikidata="Q864663" url="?curid=189429" title="Biophilia hypothesis">
<text>The biophilia hypothesis (also called BET) suggests that humans possess an innate tendency to seek connections with nature and other forms of life. Edward O. Wilson introduced and popularized the hypothesis in his book, &quot;Biophilia&quot; (1984). He defines biophilia as the &quot;innate tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes&quot;. He argued that &quot;to explore and affiliate with life is a deep and complicated process in mental development. To an extent still undervalued in philosophy and religion, our existence depends on this propensity, our spirit is woven from it, hope rises on its currents&quot;. Wilson saw modern biology as converging with biophilia: &quot;Modern biology has produced a genuinely new way of looking at the world that is incidentally congenial to the inner direction of biophilia. In other words, instinct is in this rare instance aligned with reason. . . . to the degree that we come to understand other organisms, we will place a greater value on them, and on ourselves&quot;.

== Natural affinity for living systems ==
&quot;Biophilia&quot; is an innate affinity of life or living systems. The term was first used by Erich Fromm to describe a psychological orientation of being attracted to all that is alive and vital. Wilson uses the term in a related sense when he suggests that biophilia describes &quot;the connections that human beings subconsciously seek with the rest of life.&quot; He proposed the possibility that the deep affiliations humans have with other life forms and nature as a whole are rooted in our biology. Both positive and negative (including phobic) affiliations toward natural objects (species, phenomenon) as compared to artificial objects are evidence for biophilia.

Although named by Fromm, the concept of biophilia has been proposed and defined many times over. Aristotle was one of many to put forward a concept that could be summarized as &quot;love of life&quot;. Diving into the term &quot;philia&quot;, or friendship, Aristotle evokes the idea of reciprocity and how friendships are beneficial to both parties in more than just one way, but especially in the way of happiness.

The hypothesis has since been developed as part of theories of evolutionary psychology. Taking on an evolutionary perspective people are drawn towards life and nature can be explained in part due to our evolutionary history of residing in natural environments, only recently in our history have we shifted towards an urbanized lifestyle. These connections to nature can still be seen in people today as people gravitate towards, identify with, and desire to connect with nature. These connections are not limited to any one component part of nature, as people show connections to a wide range of natural things including plants, animals, and environmental landscapes. One possible explanation is that our ancestors who had stronger connections to nature would hold an evolutionary advantage over less connected people as they would have better knowledge and therefore access to food, water, and shelter. In a broader and more general sense research has suggested that our modern urban environments are not suited for minds that evolved in natural environments.

Human preferences toward things in nature, while refined through experience and culture, are hypothetically the product of biological evolution. For example, adult mammals (especially humans) are generally attracted to baby mammal faces with their large eyes and rounded features and find them appealing across species. Similarly, the hypothesis helps explain why ordinary people care for and sometimes risk their lives to save domestic and wild animals, and keep plants and flowers in and around their homes. In the book &quot;Children and Nature: Psychological, Sociocultural, and Evolutionary Investigations&quot; edited by Peter Kahn and Stephen Kellert, the importance of animals, especially those with which a child can develop a nurturing relationship, is emphasized particularly for early and middle childhood. The same book reports on the help that animals can provide to children with autistic-spectrum disorders.

== Indigenous perspectives on the human-nature connection ==
Many Indigenous cultures do not draw a sharp distinction between humans and nature. In these traditions, humans may be understood as an integral part of the natural world rather than as separate from it. Human practices and ways of life may be seen to be based in relationships of reciprocity involving all living beings and the environment.

At the heart of such belief systems is the concept of kinship, which extends beyond human relationships and includes elements of the natural world. Humans, other animals, plants and soil are seen as dependent on each other for survival and health. For example, the Haudenosaunee people express this idea through a &quot;Thanksgiving Address&quot;, a ceremony intended to honor all aspects of nature.

Some Indigenous cultures have developed what has been referred to as &quot;traditional ecological knowledge&quot;. This may include ostensibly sustainable stewardship practices such as controlled burns of vegetation, as employed in some traditional Native American and Aboriginal Australian societies. In Hawaii, the idea of Aloha_ʻĀina aloha has served as a guide for responsible resource use.

Indigenous and animist beliefs typically view nature as sacred. Specific sites, species, or phenomena holding deep significance. Emphasis is put on objectives such as reciprocity and balance. This may imply an idea of nature restoration through sustainable practices, rituals, and ceremonies. For instance, the Anishinaabe make offerings before harvesting wild rice.

== Biophilic design ==
In architecture, biophilic design is a sustainable design strategy that incorporates reconnecting people with the natural environment. It may be seen as a necessary complement to green architecture, which decreases the environmental impact of the built world but does not address human reconnection with the natural world.
Caperna and Serafini define biophilic design as that kind of architecture, which is able to supply our inborn need of connection to life and to the vital processes. Biophilic space has been defined as the environment that strengthens life and supports the sociological and psychological components. These spaces can have positive health effects on people including reducing mental health issues in stressful spaces such as prisons, reducing chronic pain, improving memory, and lowering blood pressure. Examples of this being studied in medical settings include having a window looking out to see living plants is also shown to help speed up the healing process of patients in hospitals. Similarly, having plants in the same room as patients in hospitals also speeds up their healing process.

== Biophilia and conservation ==
Because of our technological advancements and more time spent inside buildings and cars disconnects us from nature, biophilic activities and time spent in nature may be strengthening our connections as humans to nature, so people continue to have strong urges to reconnect with nature. 
The concern for a lack of connection with the rest of nature outside of us, is that a stronger disregard for other plants, animals and less appealing wild areas could lead to further ecosystem degradation and species loss. Therefore, reestablishing a connection with nature has become more important in the field of conservation. Examples would be more available green spaces in and around cities, more classes that revolve around nature and implementing smart design for greener cities that integrate ecosystems into them such as biophilic cities. These cities can also become part of wildlife corridors to help with migrational and territorial needs of other animals.

==Biophilia in fiction==
Canadian author Hilary Scharper explicitly adapted E.O. Wilson&#x27;s concept of biophilia for her ecogothic novel, &quot;Perdita&quot;. In the novel, Perdita (meaning &quot;the lost one&quot;) is a mythological figure who brings biophilia to humanity.

==Biophilia and technology==
American philosopher Francis Sanzaro has put forth the claim that because of advances in technological connectivity, especially the internet of things (IOT), our world is becoming increasingly driven by the biophilia hypothesis, namely, the desire to connect to forms of life. Sanzaro applies Wilson&#x27;s theories to trends in artificial intelligence and psychoanalysis and argues that technology is not an antithesis to nature, but simply another form of seeking intimacy with nature.
