<text>USS &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; (CVN-69) is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier currently in service with the United States Navy. Commissioned in 1977, the ship is the second of ten s currently in service, and is the first ship named after the 34th President of the United States and General of the Army, Dwight D. Eisenhower. The vessel was initially named simply as USS &quot;Eisenhower&quot;, much like the lead ship of the class, , but the name was changed to its present form on 25 May 1970. The carrier, like all others of her class, was constructed at Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia, with the same design as the lead ship, although the ship has been overhauled twice to bring her up to the standards of those constructed more recently.

Since commissioning, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; has participated in deployments including the Gulf War in the 1990s, and more recently in support of U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. The carrier currently serves as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 2.

==Design and construction==
On 29 June 1970, Newport News Shipbuilding (then Northrop Grumman Newport News) of Newport News, Virginia, was awarded the contract for construction. On 30 June 1975, her designation was changed from CVAN-69 to CVN-69. She was laid down as hull number 599 on 15 August 1970 at Newport News shipyard at a cost of $679 million ($ billion in dollars), launched 11 October 1975 after christening by Mamie Doud Eisenhower, Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s widow, and commissioned 18 October 1977, Captain William E. Ramsey in command. On commissioning, she replaced the aging World War II–era carrier in the fleet.

==Service history==
===1970s===
&quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; was initially assigned to the United States Atlantic Fleet, and, after receiving over a year of training, the ship was visited by President Jimmy Carter with his wife Rosalynn Carter, Defense Secretary Harold Brown and National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzeziński. In January 1979, she sailed for her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. During this deployment, while off the coast of Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin visited &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower,&quot; The carrier returned to Norfolk Naval Station in July of the same year.

===1980s===

Under the command of her second Commanding Officer, Captain James H. Mauldin, her second deployment occurred in 1980, when she was dispatched by President Carter to the Indian Ocean, in response to the Iran hostage crisis. She relieved sister-carrier &quot;Nimitz&quot; three days after the Iranian hostage rescue attempt. To help maintain morale, Captain Mauldin allowed the men aboard to participate in &quot;Flight Deck Olympics&quot;. The Navy also authorized a special ration of beer, consisting of two cans per man every continuous 93 days at sea. The two beers were well refrigerated and were handed out to each crewman during &quot;Steel Beach&quot; breaks. It was the first U.S. Navy&#x27;s six-pack cruise since World War II. Officers were flown by helicopter to British ships for their rum rations. Ike&#x27;s crew was awarded with the Navy Unit Commendation ribbon and the Navy Marine Corps Expeditionary medal in 1980 for this extended cruise. During this cruise, port visits to Kenya and Australia were cancelled due to conflicts in the region. Eventually, Ike visited Singapore after which it returned to the Indian Ocean for a total of over 320 days out at sea for 1980.

&quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; returned to the Mediterranean Sea for her third deployment, under the command of her third Captain E. W. Clexton Jr., from 5 January to 13 July 1982. During this deployment, 11 passengers and crew were lost when &quot;Mamie&quot;, her onboard logistics aircraft, crashed near Souda Bay, Crete, on 2 April. She also participated in the 24 June evacuation of the U.S. Embassy staff from Beirut, Lebanon, as that country descended into civil war.

&quot;Ike&quot; embarked on her fourth deployment from 27 April to 2 December 1983. In addition to several major exercises with NATO, Egyptian and U.S. Air Force personnel and assets, she came under direct threat of attack as Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qadhafi vowed to turn the Gulf of Sidra into a &quot;red gulf of blood&quot; should the ship enter the zone claimed by Libya. Further tensions between Libya, Chad, Sudan, and Egypt forced &quot;Ike&quot; to be ordered to the disputed area. Between 2 and 5 August, the ship&#x27;s Combat Air Patrol intercepted two MiG-23 Flogger and two Dassault-Breguet Mirage 5 aircraft headed toward the carrier in separate engagements. The Libyan aircraft immediately turned back toward their bases, ending both incidents. Diplomatic measures deflated the crisis days later. On 26 August, &quot;Ike&quot; sailed within sight of the embattled city of Beirut, Lebanon. The ship launched reconnaissance sorties in support of the U.S. Marines and other international peacekeepers coming under attack ashore. After 93 days at sea since her previous port visit, &quot;Ike&quot; visited Italy on 21 October. She once again had to make speed toward Beirut, just five days later on the 26th, because of suicide attacks that killed nearly 300 American and French troops on 23 October. &quot;Ike&quot; would remain on station until relieved by carriers and in mid November.
In May and June 1984, for the 40th anniversary of D-Day, &quot;Ike&quot; was deployed to Normandy, France and Portsmouth, England. The port visit in England included a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. After her fifth deployment &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; went into Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock in October 1985 for a major overhaul. The 18-month yard period included the addition of the Close-in Weapons System (CIWS), NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System, Naval Tactical Data System, anti-submarine warfare module, communications upgrades and rehabilitation of 1,831 berths in 25 compartments. She re-entered the fleet in April 1987.

On 29 February 1988, &quot;Ike&quot; started her sixth deployment to the Mediterranean. While returning to Norfolk, on 29 August 1988, she collided with an anchored Spanish bulk carrier, the &quot;Urduliz&quot;, while entering the harbor to dock at Norfolk Naval Station when wind and currents pushed the carrier off course, but only caused minor damage to both ships. &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard (Portsmouth, Virginia) in September 1988; she returned to the fleet in April 1989.

===1990s===

In 1990, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; completed her seventh Mediterranean deployment. The deployment became a commemorative event in the worldwide &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower Centennial&quot;, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the late president&#x27;s birth. During D-Day anniversary ceremonies off the coast of Normandy, President Eisenhower&#x27;s son John Eisenhower and D-Day veterans embarked in the ship, while Carrier Air Wing Seven conducted a memorial flyover of the American cemetery at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France.

====Gulf War====
In response to Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; became the first carrier to conduct sustained operations in the Red Sea, and only the second nuclear-powered aircraft carrier ever to transit the Suez Canal. &quot;Ike&quot; served as a ready striking force in the event Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia, and participated in maritime interception operations in support of a United Nations embargo against Iraq.

After completion of an extensive shipyard period and work-up, the carrier deployed 26 September 1991 to the Persian Gulf to continue multi-national operations with coalition forces in support of Operation Desert Storm. &quot;Ike&quot; returned to Norfolk on 2 April 1992, and, on 12 January 1993, entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul and conversion, returning to the fleet 12 November 1993.

====Post–Gulf War====

In September 1994, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and elements of the U.S. 10th Mountain Division first tested the concept of adaptive force packaging. The division&#x27;s soldiers and equipment were loaded on board, and the ship&#x27;s Army/Navy team headed for Port-au-Prince to lead Operation Uphold Democracy, the U.S.-led effort to restore the elected government of Haiti.

One month later, in October 1994, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; departed for a six-month deployment which included flying missions in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Deny Flight. This deployment marked the first time that women had deployed as crew members of a U.S. Navy combatant. &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, Carrier Air Wing Three (CVW-3), and the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 8 staff team included more than 400 women. The integration of women caused some negative headlines for the Navy. During the deployment, 15 women serving aboard had to be reassigned ashore because of pregnancy, earning the ship the nickname &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. There was also a case of a sailor who filmed himself having sex with a female.

&quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; returned to Newport News Shipbuilding on 17 July 1995 for an 18-month complex overhaul, completed on 27 January 1997. Among other upgrades, they installed a new Advanced combat direction system. The ship departed on her 10th deployment on 10 June 1998 and returned in December. In February 1999, she returned to the Norfolk Navy Shipyard for a six-month refitting and returned to the fleet in June. Upon completion in June 1999, she returned to full duty in the fleet.

In April 1995, the long-running game show &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; recorded two weeks of shows from the hangar bay of the &quot;Eisenhower&quot;. 

===2000s===
Deploying in February 2000 and returning that August on the &quot;Millennium Cruise&quot;, for the first time &quot;Ike&quot;″s embarked aircraft dropped ordnance in combat while enforcing Operation Southern Watch&#x27;s No-Fly Zone over Iraq.

On 3 October 2006 with Carrier Air Wing Seven (CVW-7), &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; returned to sea as flagship of RADM Allen G. Myers, commanding Carrier Strike Group Eight (CSG-8), which included guided-missile cruiser , guided-missile destroyers and , and fast-attack submarine . She visited Naples, Italy, and then Limassol, Cyprus, for three days in October 2006 before departing to the east. She entered the Persian Gulf in December 2006.

On 8 January 2007, a U.S. AC-130 gunship based out of Djibouti was dispatched to target Al-Qaeda operatives located in Somalia. &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; was deployed in the Indian Ocean to provide air cover for the operation and, if needed, to evacuate downed airmen and other casualties. She joined other U.S. and allied vessels from Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150), based out of Bahrain. A U.S. spokesperson did not say which particular ships comprised the cordon, but the task force included vessels from Canada, France, Germany, Pakistan, the UK and the US. Ships of CTF-150 from the U.S. Navy include the &quot;Ramage&quot; and the . The aim of CTF-150&#x27;s patrols is to &quot;... stop SICC leaders or foreign militant supporters escaping&quot; Somalia. In March 2007, following the Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; began battle group exercises off the Iranian coastline. The following month, in April, the ship was relieved by &quot;Nimitz&quot;.

On 4 October 2008 &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; Petty Officer 2nd Class Robert Lemar Robinson was killed aboard ship during training exercises off the coast of North Carolina. The sailor was struck and mortally wounded, by an airplane at 8:15 p.m. on the carrier&#x27;s flight deck.

On 21 February 2009, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; deployed for the Arabian Sea and environs rotating into the forward-deployed forces there. She served as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 8 commanded by Rear Admiral Kurt W. Tidd. Also embarked was Carrier Air Wing 7 and the staff of Commander, Destroyer Squadron 28. Other ships of Strike Group 8 were , , , , and . In addition to supporting Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, the strike group conducted maritime security operations including anti-piracy operations. On 16 May, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; became the first &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carrier to dock pier-side in Manama, Bahrain. The last carrier to moor pierside in Bahrain was in 1948. On 30 July 2009, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; returned to Naval Station Norfolk after an almost six-month-long deployment.

=== 2010s ===

On 2 January 2010, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; again deployed to the U.S. 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operation in the Middle East. She served as the flagship of the &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; Carrier Strike Group commanded by Rear Admiral Philip S. Davidson. While in theater, the strike group provided security cooperation, forward naval presence, maritime security, and crisis response. In addition to &quot;Ike&quot;, the strike group was made up of Carrier Air Wing 7; Commander, Destroyer Squadron 28; the guided-missile cruiser ; and guided-missile destroyers , , and . On 28 July 2010, &quot;Ike&quot; returned to her homeport in Norfolk.

The ship was placed in a planned incremental availability at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from September 2010 through June 2011. The ship was deployed again 7 June 2012 to the Middle East in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The ship returned to homeport 19 December 2012. On 22 February 2013, &quot;Ike&quot; and Strike Group 8 departed for another Mediterranean and Mid-East deployment. After pulling into Marseille, France in early March, the German became the first to fully integrate into an American strike group. &quot;Hamburg&quot;, commanded by Commander (FKpt) Ralf Kuchler (GN), remained with the strike group while it operated with the 5th fleet. The ship returned to homeport 3 July 2013. On 6 August the ship began an ammunition offload in preparation for an upcoming docked planned incremental availability (DPIA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. On 26 August 2014, the ship was moved to Berth 42-43 from Dry Dock #8 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, and as of 4 February 2015, the DPIA was four months behind schedule, with the ship planned to remain in the yard until at least April 2015. On 3 September 2015, the ship went back to sea.

On 8 June 2016, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and her Carrier Strike Group sailed the Atlantic Ocean into the U.S. 6th Fleet&#x27;s area of operations (AoR) in support of U.S. national security interests in Europe. On 22 November 2016, &quot;Military Times&quot; reported that since June 2016, when the ship entered the Persian Gulf after launching strikes from the eastern Mediterranean, the carrier&#x27;s Captain, Paul Spedero, reported that sorties from &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; had dropped nearly 1,100 bombs on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. &quot;Ike&quot; returned to homeport Norfolk 30 December.

On 18 March 2016, while she was sailing off the coast of Virginia, eight members of her deck crew were injured when the arresting gear cables failed and &quot;came apart&quot;, during the routine landing of an E-2 Hawkeye aircraft. Six of the injured deck crew were flown by helicopter to nearby shore-based hospitals, while the other two remained and were treated aboard ship. None of the eight suffered life-threatening injuries. The Hawkeye immediately resumed flight and landed safely at Chambers Field, Norfolk Naval Station, with no reports of injuries to her crew or damage to the aircraft.

In December 2016, the ship completed her 17th deployment to the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

===2020s===
On 13 January 2020, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; left Norfolk for her Composite Training Unit Exercise ahead of deploying. After exercising with Carrier Strike Group 10 until late February, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; immediately deployed to the Persian Gulf without returning to port, due to Dynamic Force Employment (DFE), a strategy to help make naval deployments less predictive.

On 26 June 2020, the ship surpassed the &#x27;s record of 160 consecutive days at sea without a port call by reaching its 161st day. This new mark is attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ship&#x27;s operational commitment to &quot;remain clean&quot; by avoiding any contact with ports that carried the potential of introducing the novel coronavirus into the crew. On 25 and 26 July 2020, the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) co-trained with USS &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; southeast of Crete.

On 3 March 2021, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;″s Strike Group conducted Exercise Lightning Handshake with Royal Moroccan Navy frigate and Royal Moroccan Air Force fighter jets. On 5 March, the underwent alongside her in the Strait of Gibraltar. On 2 April, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, with Carrier Air Wing 3 and her Carrier Strike Group, transited the Suez Canal into the Red Sea in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

====Israel-Hamas war====
On 14 October 2023, Lloyd Austin directed &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and her carrier strike group, which includes the cruiser , and destroyers , &quot;Mason&quot; and , to the eastern Mediterranean in response to Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas. This is the second carrier strike group to be sent to the region in response to the conflict, following and her group, which was dispatched only six days earlier.

She is currently under the command of Captain Christopher &quot;Chowdah&quot; Hill. To boost morale Captain Hill and senior officers have instituted a philosophy on the ship called “the Way of the Warrior Sailor.” In his communication as a leader, Hill said he uses &quot;rapid, relentless, repetitive, positive communication,&quot; or R3P. In doing so, Hill said he emphasizes the importance of acknowledging each sailor personally, highlighting the significance of their roles and reassuring them of their performance. &quot;What does morale get us? Morale gets us success in battle,&quot; Hill explained to &quot;CBS 60 Minutes&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s the ultimate goal. You know, it might allow you to do well on inspections, allow you to do well in your day-to-day activities. But ultimately, it&#x27;s about combat and success … And it&#x27;s working.&quot;

====United States–Houthi conflict (2023–present)====
On 26 December 2023, at 6:30 a.m., &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; launched Super Hornet aircraft and, together with the destroyer &quot;Laboon&quot;, destroyed 12 attack drones, three anti-ship missiles and two ground attack cruise missiles in the southern Red Sea, fired from Yemen&#x27;s Houthi rebels in an over 10 hour-action.

On 30 December, Danish container ship issued a distress call after coming under fire from four small ships commanded by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen. Attempts were also made to board &quot;Maersk Hangzhou&quot; by force, while a contracted security team defended the ship. &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and guided missile destroyer &quot;Gravely&quot; responded to a distress call from the container ship. Verbal commands were radioed to the Houthi ships, while helicopters from &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; were dispatched. After taking small arms fire, U.S. Navy helicopters returned fire, sinking three of the four Houthi ships. There was no damage to U.S. equipment or personnel. In the process of responding to the distress call, &quot;Gravely&quot; shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Yemen.

On 10 January 2024, the Houthis carried out more missile attacks against US and UK ships. All projectiles were shot down by &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and other ships. On 12 January, aircraft from Carrier Air Wing Three embarked on &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot;, participated in the 2024 missile strikes in Yemen against Houthi rebels. Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired by the cruiser &quot;Philippine Sea&quot; as well as the destroyers &quot;Mason&quot; and &quot;Gravely&quot;, and the submarine .

&quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; continued supporting Operation Prosperity Guardian and the 2024 missile strikes in Yemen until 26 April when she passed through the Suez Canal and entered the Eastern Mediterranean. She returned to the Red Sea in May to resume operations after a port call in Souda Bay, Crete. The Yemeni Supreme Political Council stated it launched two attacks on &quot;Dwight D Eisenhower&quot;, though American officials denied this, and no evidence has surfaced of such attacks. Fake footage of a damaged ship were shared across social media which were further amplified by pro-Chinese and pro-Russian social media accounts. Associated Press journalists toured the ship after the alleged attack and found no damage except a leak from a pipe in a dining room, and Captain Hill noted during the Taco Tuesday on the ship that Houthis have claimed to have sunk the ship multiple times before.

On 14 July 2024, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; returned to Naval Station Norfolk after a nine-month combat deployment. Aircraft from Carrier Air Wing 3 expended nearly 60 air-to-air missiles and 420 air-to-surface weapons during the deployment.

<text>The Society of the Friends of the Constitution (), renamed the Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality () after 1792 and commonly known as the Jacobin Club () or simply the Jacobins (; ), was the most influential political club during the French Revolution of 1789. The period of its political ascendancy includes the Reign of Terror, during which well over 10,000 people were put on trial and executed in France, many for political crimes.

Initially founded in 1789 by anti-royalist deputies from Brittany, the club grew into a nationwide republican movement with a membership estimated at a half million or more. The Jacobin Club was heterogeneous and included both prominent parliamentary factions of the early 1790s: The Mountain and the Girondins. In 1792–93, the Girondins were more prominent in leading France when they declared war on Austria and on Prussia, overthrew King Louis XVI, and set up the French First Republic. In May 1793, the leaders of the Mountain faction, led by Maximilien Robespierre, succeeded in sidelining the Girondin faction and controlled the government until July 1794. Their time in government featured high levels of political violence, and for this reason the period of the Jacobin/Mountain government is identified as the Reign of Terror. In October 1793, 21 prominent Girondins were guillotined. The Mountain-dominated government executed 17,000 opponents nationwide as a way to suppress the Vendée insurrection and the Federalist revolts, and to deter recurrences. In July 1794, the National Convention pushed the administration of Robespierre and his allies out of power and had Robespierre and 21 associates executed. In November 1794, the Jacobin Club closed.

In the years and decades after the revolution, the term &quot;Jacobin&quot; was used in an extended sense to denote political positions perceived as similar to those of the historical Jacobins and the Mountain in the National Convention. It was popular among conservative publicists as a pejorative to deride progressive politics, and among Anglophone progressives likewise as a pejorative denoting the violent excesses of the revolution, whereas they associated its positive features and principles with the Girondins. In Britain, the term faintly echoed negative connotations of Jacobitism, the pro-Catholic, monarchist, rarely insurrectional political movement that faded out decades earlier tied to deposed King James II of England and his descendants. The term &quot;Jacobin&quot; reached obsolescence and supersedence before the Russian Revolution, when the terms (Radical) Marxism, anarchism, socialism, and communism had overtaken it.

In modern France, the term &quot;Jacobin&quot; generally denotes a position of more equal formal rights, centralization, and moderate authoritarianism. It can be used to denote supporters of a role of the state in the transformation of society. It is, in particular, used as a self-identification by proponents of a state education system that strongly promotes and inculcates civic values. It is more controversially used by or for proponents of a strong nation-state capable of resisting undesirable foreign interference.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
When the Estates General of 1789 in France convened in May–June 1789 at the Palace of Versailles, the Jacobin club, originating as the &quot;Club Breton&quot;, comprised exclusively a group of Breton representatives attending those Estates General. Deputies from other regions throughout France soon joined. Early members included the dominating comte de Mirabeau, Parisian deputy Abbé Sieyès, Dauphiné deputy Antoine Barnave, Jérôme Pétion, the Abbé Grégoire, Charles Lameth, Alexandre Lameth, Artois deputy Robespierre, the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, and La Revellière-Lépeaux. At this time meetings occurred in secret, and few traces remain concerning what took place or where the meetings convened.

=== Transfer to Paris ===
By the March on Versailles in October 1789, the club, still entirely composed of deputies, reverted to being a provincial caucus for National Constituent Assembly deputies from Brittany. The club was re-founded in November 1789 as the &quot;Société de la Révolution&quot;, inspired in part by a letter sent from the Revolution Society of London to the Assembly congratulating the French on regaining their liberty.

To accommodate growing membership, the group rented for its meetings the refectory of the Dominican monastery of the “Jacobins” in the Rue Saint-Honoré, adjacent to the seat of the Assembly. They changed their name to &quot;Société des amis de la Constitution&quot; in late January, though by this time, their opponents had already concisely dubbed them &quot;Jacobins&quot;, a nickname originally given to French Dominicans because their first house in Paris was in the Rue Saint-Jacques.

=== Growth ===

Once in Paris, the club soon extended its membership to others besides deputies. All citizens were allowed to enter, and even foreigners were welcomed: the English writer Arthur Young joined the club in this manner on 18 January 1790. Jacobin Club meetings soon became a place for radical and rousing oratory that pushed for republicanism, widespread education, universal suffrage, separation of church and state, and other reforms.

On 8 February 1790, the society became formally constituted on this broader basis by the adoption of the rules drawn up by Barnave, which were issued with the signature of the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, the president. The club&#x27;s objectives were defined as such:
# To discuss in advance questions to be decided by the National Assembly.
# To work for the establishment and strengthening of the constitution in accordance with the spirit of the preamble (that is, of respect for legally constituted authority and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen).
# To correspond with other societies of the same kind which should be formed in the realm.

At the same time the rules of order of election were settled, and the constitution of the club determined. There was to be a president, elected every month, four secretaries, a treasurer, and committees elected to superintend elections and presentations, the correspondence, and the administration of the club. Any member who by word or action showed that his principles were contrary to the constitution and the rights of man was to be expelled.

By the 7th article the club decided to admit as associates similar societies in other parts of France and to maintain with them a regular correspondence. By 10 August 1790 there were already one hundred and fifty-two affiliated clubs; the attempts at counter-revolution led to a great increase of their number in the spring of 1791, and by the close of the year the Jacobins had a network of branches all over France. At the peak there were at least 7,000 chapters throughout France, with a membership estimated at a half-million or more. It was this widespread yet highly centralized organization that gave to the Jacobin Club great power.

=== Character ===

By early 1791, clubs like the Jacobins, the &quot;Club des Cordeliers&quot; and the &quot;Cercle Social&quot; were increasingly dominating French political life. Numbers of men were members of two or more of such clubs. Women were not accepted as members of the Jacobin Club (nor of most other clubs), but they were allowed to follow the discussions from the balconies. The rather high subscription of the Jacobin Club confined its membership to well-off men. The Jacobins claimed to speak on behalf of the people but were themselves not of &#x27;the people&#x27;: contemporaries saw the Jacobins as a club of the bourgeoisie.

As far as the central society in Paris was concerned, it was composed almost entirely of professional men (such as the lawyer Robespierre) and well-to-do bourgeoisie (like the brewer Santerre). From the start, however, other elements were also present. Besides the teenage son of the Duc d&#x27;Orléans, Louis Philippe, a future king of France, aristocrats such as the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, the prince de Broglie, and the vicomte de Noailles, and the bourgeoisie formed the mass of the members. The club further included people like &quot;père&quot; Michel Gérard, a peasant proprietor from Tuel-en-Montgermont, in Brittany, whose rough common sense was admired as the oracle of popular wisdom, and whose countryman&#x27;s waistcoat and plaited hair were later on to become the model for the Jacobin fashion.

The Jacobin Club supported the monarchy up until the very Eve of the Republic (20 September 1792). They did not support the petition of 17 July 1791 for the king&#x27;s dethronement, but instead published their own petition calling for replacement of King Louis XVI.

The departure of the conservative members of the Jacobin Club to form their own Feuillants Club in July 1791 to some extent radicalized the Jacobin Club.

=== Polarization between Robespierrists and Girondins ===

Late 1791, a group of Jacobins in the Legislative Assembly advocated war with Prussia and Austria. Most prominent among them was Brissot, other members were Pierre Vergniaud, Fauchet, Maximin Isnard, Jean-Marie Roland.

Maximilien Robespierre, also a Jacobin, strongly pleaded against war with Prussia and Austria – but in the Jacobin Club, not in the Assembly where he was not seated. Disdainfully, Robespierre addressed those Jacobin war promoters as &#x27;the faction from the Gironde&#x27;; some, not all of them, were indeed from department Gironde. The Jacobins finally rid itself of Feuillants in its midst; the number of clubs increased considerably, convening became a nationwide fad. In March 1792, in retaliation for their opposition to war with Austria the Feuillant ministers were forced out by the Girondins. The Assembly in April 1792 finally decided for war, thus following the &#x27;Girondin&#x27; line on it, but Robespierre&#x27;s place among the Jacobins had now become much more prominent. 

From then on, a polarization process started among the members of the Jacobin Club, between a group around Robespierre – after September 1792 called &#x27;Montagnards&#x27; or &#x27;Montagne&#x27;, in English &#x27;the Mountain&#x27; – and the Girondins. These groups never had any official status, nor official memberships. The Mountain was not even very homogenous in their political views: what united them was their aversion to the Girondins.

The Legislative Assembly, governing France from October 1791 until September 1792, was dominated by men like Brissot, Isnard and Roland: Girondins. But after June 1792, Girondins visited less and less the Jacobin Club, where Robespierre, their fierce opponent, grew more and more dominant.

=== Opposition between Montagnards and Girondins in the National Convention ===

On 21 September 1792, after the fall of the monarchy the title assumed by the Jacobin Club after the promulgation of the constitution of 1791 (&quot;Société des amis de la constitution séants aux Jacobins à Paris&quot;) was changed to &quot;Société des Jacobins, amis de la liberté et de l&#x27;égalité&quot; (Society of the Jacobins, Friends of Freedom and Equality). In the newly elected National Convention, governing France as of 21 September 1792, Maximilien Robespierre made his comeback in the center of French power. Together with his 25-year-old protégé Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, Marat, Danton and other associates they took places on the left side on the highest seats of the session room: therefore that group around and led by Robespierre was called The Mountain (French: &quot;la Montagne&quot;, &quot;les Montagnards&quot;).

Some historians prefer to identify a parliamentary group around Robespierre as Jacobins, which can be confusing because not all Montagnards were Jacobin and their primal enemies, the Girondins, were originally also Jacobins. By September 1792, Robespierre indeed had also become the dominant voice in the Jacobin Club. Since late 1791, the Girondins became opponents of Robespierre, taking their place on the right side of the session room of the convention. By this time, they stopped visiting the Jacobin Club.

Those parliamentary groups, such as the Montagnards and the Girondins, never had any official status. As a result, historians estimate the Girondins in the Convention at 150 men strong and the Montagnards at 120. The remaining 480 of the 750 deputies of the convention were called the Plain (French: &quot;la Plaine&quot;) and managed to keep some speed in the debates while Girondins and Montagnards were mainly occupied with nagging the opposite side. Most Ministries were manned by friends or allies of the Girondins, but while the Girondins were stronger than the Montagnards outside Paris, inside Paris the Montagnards were much more popular, implying that the public galleries of the convention were always loudly cheering for Montagnards, while jeering at Girondins speaking.

On 6 April 1793, the convention established the &quot;Comité de salut public&quot; (Committee of Public Prosperity, also translated as Committee of Public Safety) as sort of executive government of nine, later twelve members, always accountable to the National Convention. Initially, it counted no Girondins and only one or two Montagnards, but gradually the influence of Montagnards in the Committee grew.

=== Girondins disbarred from the National Convention ===

Early April 1793, Minister of War Pache said to the National Convention that the 22 leaders of the Girondins should be banned. Later that month, the Girondin Guadet accused the Montagnard Marat of &#x27;preaching plunder and murder&#x27; and trying &#x27;to destroy the sovereignty of the people&#x27;. A majority of the Convention agreed to put Marat on trial, but the court of justice quickly acquitted Marat. This apparent victory of the Montagnards intensified their antipathies of the Girondins, and more proposals were vented to get rid of the Girondins.

On both 18 and 25 May 1793, the acting president of the convention, Isnard, a Girondin, warned that the disturbances and disorder on the galleries and around the convention would finally lead the country to anarchy and civil war, and he threatened on 25 May: &quot;If anything should befall to the representatives of the nation, I declare, in the name of France, that all of Paris will be obliterated&quot;. The next day, Robespierre said in the Jacobin Club that the people should &quot;rise up against the corrupted deputies&quot; in the convention. On 27 May, both Girondins and Montagnards accused the other party of propagating civil war.

On 2 June 1793, the convention was besieged in its Tuileries Palace by a crowd of around 80,000 armed soldiers, clamorously on the hand of the Montagnards. In a chaotic session a decree was adopted that day by the convention, expelling 22 leading Girondins from the convention, including Lanjuinais, Isnard and Fauchet.

=== Montagnard rule and civil war ===

Around June 1793, Maximilien Robespierre and some of his associates (Montagnards) gained greater power in France. Many of them, like Robespierre himself, were Jacobin: Fouché, Collot d&#x27;Herbois, Billaud-Varenne, Marat, Danton, Saint-Just. Three other powerful Montagnards were not known as Jacobin: Barère, Hébert and Couthon. In &#x27;culture wars&#x27; and history writing after 1793 however, the group around Robespierre dominating French politics in June 1793–July 1794 was often designated as &#x27;Jacobins&#x27;.
Many of these Montagnards (and Jacobins) entered, or were already, in the &quot;de facto&quot; executive government of France, the Committee of Public Prosperity (or Public Safety): Barère was in it since April 1793 until at least October 1793, Danton served there from April until July 1793, Couthon and Saint-Just had entered the Committee in May, Robespierre entered it in July, Collot d&#x27;Herbois in September and Billaud-Varenne also around September 1793.
Robespierre for his steadfast adherence to and defence of his views received the nickname and reputation of &quot;l&#x27;Incorruptible&quot; (The Incorruptible or The Unassailable).

Several deposed Girondin-Jacobin Convention deputies, among them Jean-Marie Roland, Brissot, Pétion, Louvet, Buzot and Guadet, left Paris to help organize revolts in more than 60 of the 83 departments against the politicians and Parisians, mainly Montagnards, that had seized power over the Republic. The government in Paris called such revolts &#x27;federalist&#x27; which was not accurate: most did not strive for regional autonomy but for a different central government.

In October 1793, 21 former Girondin Convention deputies were sentenced to death for supporting an insurrection in Caen. In March 1794, the Montagnard Hébert and some followers were sentenced to death; in April the Montagnard Danton and 13 of his followers were sentenced to death; in both cases after insinuation by Robespierre in the Convention that those &quot;internal enemies&quot; were promoting &#x27;the triumph of tyranny&#x27;. Meanwhile, the Montagnard-dominated government resorted also to harsh measures to repress what they considered counter-revolution, conspiracy and &quot;enemies of freedom&quot; in the provinces outside Paris, resulting in 17,000 death sentences between September 1793 and July 1794 in all of France.

In late June 1794, three colleagues on the Committee of Public Prosperity/Safety – Billaud-Varenne, Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Carnot – called Robespierre a dictator. On 10 Thermidor, Year II (28 July 1794), at some time in the evening, Louis Legendre was sent out with troops to arrest leading members of the Montagnards at the Hôtel de Ville and the Jacobin Club itself where members had been gathering every Saturday evening. Robespierre and 21 associates including the Jacobin Saint-Just and the Montagnard Couthon were sentenced to death by the National Convention and guillotined.

Probably because of the high level of repressive violence – but also to discredit Robespierre and associates as solely responsible for it – historians have taken up the habit to roughly label the period June 1793–July 1794 as &#x27;Reign of Terror&#x27;. Later and modern scholars explain that high level of repressive violence occurred at a time when France was menaced by civil war and by a coalition of foreign hostile powers, requiring the discipline of the Terror to mold France into a united Republic capable of resisting this double peril.

=== Closure ===

With the execution of Robespierre and other leading Montagnards and Jacobins, began the Thermidorian Reaction. The Jacobins became targets of Thermidorian and anti-Jacobin papers, with Jacobins lamenting counterrevolutionary pamphlets &quot;poisoning public opinion&quot;. The Jacobins disavowed the support they gave Robespierre on 9 Thermidor, yet supported an unpopular return to the Terror. Meanwhile, the society&#x27;s finances fell into disarray and membership dipped to 600. Further, they were linked to ongoing trials of prominent members of the Terror involved in atrocities in Nantes, especially Jean-Baptiste Carrier.

Organized gangs formed, the &quot;jeunesse doree&quot; or Muscadins, who harassed and attacked Jacobin members, even assailing the Jacobin Club hall in Paris. On 21 Brumaire, the Convention refused to support enforcement of protection of the club. The Committee of General Security decided to close the Jacobins&#x27; meeting hall late that night, resulting in it being padlocked at four in the morning.

The next meeting day, 22 Brumaire (12 November 1794), without debate the National Convention passed a decree permanently closing the Jacobin Club by a nearly unanimous vote. Within a year 93% of the Jacobin clubs were closed throughout the country.

=== Reunion of Jacobin adherents ===
An attempt to reorganize Jacobin adherents was the foundation of the &quot;Réunion d&#x27;amis de l&#x27;égalité et de la liberté&quot;, in July 1799, which had its headquarters in the &quot;Salle du Manège&quot; of the Tuileries, and was thus known as the &quot;Club du Manège&quot;. It was patronized by Barras, and some two hundred and fifty members of the two councils of the legislature were enrolled as members, including many notable ex-Jacobins. It published a newspaper called the &quot;Journal des Libres&quot;, proclaimed the apotheosis of Robespierre and Babeuf, and attacked the Directory as a &quot;royauté pentarchique&quot;. But public opinion was now preponderantly moderate or royalist, and the club was violently attacked in the press and in the streets. The suspicions of the government were aroused; it had to change its meeting-place from the Tuileries to the church of the Jacobins (Temple of Peace) in the Rue du Bac, and in August it was suppressed, after barely a month&#x27;s existence. Its members avenged themselves on the Directory by supporting Napoleon Bonaparte.

== Influence ==
=== Political influence ===

The Jacobin movement encouraged sentiments of patriotism and liberty amongst the populace. The movement&#x27;s contemporaries, such as the King Louis XVI, located the effectiveness of the revolutionary movement not &quot;in the force and 1789
bayonets of soldiers, guns, cannons and shells but by the marks of political power&quot;. Ultimately, the Jacobins were to control several key political bodies, in particular the Committee of Public Safety and, through it, the National Convention, which was not only a legislature but also took upon itself executive and judicial functions. The Jacobins as a political force were seen as &quot;less selfish, more patriotic, and more sympathetic to the Paris Populace.&quot;

The Jacobin Club developed into a bureau for French republicanism and revolution, rejecting its original &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic policy and economic liberal approach in favour of economic interventionism. In power, they completed the abolition of feudalism in France that had been formally decided 4 August 1789 but had been held in check by a clause requiring compensation for the abrogation of the feudal privileges.

Robespierre entered the political arena at the very beginning of the Revolution, having been elected to represent Artois at the Estates General. Robespierre was viewed as the quintessential political force of the Jacobin Movement, thrusting ever deeper the dagger of liberty within the despotism of the Monarchy. As a disciple of Rousseau, Robespierre&#x27;s political views were rooted in Rousseau&#x27;s notion of the social contract, which promoted &quot;the rights of man&quot;. Robespierre particularly favored the rights of the broader population to eat, for example, over the rights of individual merchants. &quot;I denounce the assassins of the people to you and you respond, &#x27;let them act as they will.&#x27; In such a system, all is against society; all favors the grain merchants.&quot; Robespierre famously elaborated this conception in his speech on 2 December 1792: &quot;What is the first goal of society? To maintain the imprescribable rights of man. What is the first of these rights? The right to exist.&quot;

The ultimate political vehicle for the Jacobin movement was the Reign of Terror overseen by the Committee of Public Safety, who were given executive powers to purify and unify the Republic. The Committee instituted requisitioning, rationing, and conscription to consolidate new citizen armies. They instituted the Terror as a means of combating those they perceived as enemies within: Robespierre declared, &quot;the first maxim of your policy ought to be to lead the people by reason and the people&#x27;s enemies by terror.&quot;

The meeting place of the Fraternal Society of Patriots of Both Sexes was an old library room of the convent which hosted the Jacobins, and it was suggested that the Fraternal Society grew out of the regular occupants of a special gallery allotted to women at the Jacobin Club.

Georges Valois, founder of the first non-Italian fascist party Faisceau, claimed the roots of fascism stemmed from the Jacobin movement. This is disputed as the Jacobin&#x27;s were socially and politically liberal, against conservatism, and advocated for republicanism. The Jacobin movement is considered to be left-wing.

==== Left-wing politics ====
The political rhetoric and populist ideas espoused by the Jacobins would lead to the development of the modern leftist movements throughout the 19th and 20th century, with Jacobinism being the political foundation of almost all leftist schools of thought including anarchism, communism and socialism. The Paris Commune was seen as the revolutionary successor to the Jacobins. The undercurrent of radical and populist tendencies espoused and enacted by the Jacobins would create a complete cultural and societal shock within the traditional and conservative governments of Europe, leading to new political ideas of society emerging. Jacobin rhetoric would lead to increasing secularization and skepticism towards the governments of Europe throughout the 1800s. This complex and complete revolution in political, societal and cultural structure, caused in part by the Jacobins, had lasting impact throughout Europe, with such societal revolutions throughout the 1800s culminating in the Revolutions of 1848.

Jacobin populism and complete structural destruction of the old order led to an increasingly revolutionary spirit throughout Europe and such changes would contribute to new political foundations. Leftist organizations would take different elements from Jacobin&#x27;s core foundation. Anarchists took influence from the Jacobins use of mass movements, direct democracy and left-wing populism. The Jacobin philosophy of a complete dismantling of an old system, with completely radical and new structures, is historically seen as one of the most revolutionary and important movements throughout modern history.

=== Cultural influence ===
The cultural influence of the Jacobin movement during the French Revolution revolved around the creation of the Citizen. As commented in Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s 1762 book &quot;The Social Contract&quot;, &quot;Citizenship is the expression of a sublime reciprocity between individual and General will.&quot; This view of citizenship and the General Will, once empowered, could simultaneously embrace the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and adopt the French Constitution of 1793, then immediately suspend that constitution and all ordinary legality and institute Revolutionary Tribunals that did not grant a presumption of innocence.

The Jacobins saw themselves as constitutionalists, dedicated to the Rights of Man and in particular, to the declaration&#x27;s principle of &quot;preservation of the natural rights of liberty, property, security, and resistance to oppression&quot; (Article II of the Declaration). The constitution reassured the protection of personal freedom and social progress within French society. The cultural influence of the Jacobin movement was effective in reinforcing these rudiments, developing a milieu for revolution. The Constitution was admired by most Jacobins as the foundation of the emerging republic and of the rise of citizenship.

The Jacobins rejected both the church and atheism. They set up new religious cults, the Cult of Reason and later Cult of the Supreme Being, to replace Catholicism. They advocated deliberate government-organized religion as a substitute for both the rule of law and a replacement of mob violence as inheritors of a war that at the time of their rise to power threatened the very existence of the Revolution. Once in power, the Jacobins completed the overthrow of the Ancien Régime and successfully defended the Revolution from military defeat. They consolidated republicanism in France and contributed greatly to the secularism and the sense of nationhood that have marked all French republican regimes to this day. However, their ruthless and unjudicial methods discredited the Revolution in the eyes of many. The resulting Thermidorian Reaction shuttered all of the Jacobin clubs, removed all Jacobins from power and condemned many, well beyond the ranks of the Mountain, to death or exile.

<doc id="193424" wikidata="Q336101" url="?curid=193424" title="George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham">
<text>George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, 19th Baron de Ros (30 January 1628 – 16 April 1687) was an English statesman and poet who exerted considerable political power during the reign of Charles II of England.

A Royalist during the English Civil War, in 1651 he joined Charles II&#x27;s court-in-exile in France. He returned to England in 1657 after a disagreement with the king, but subsequently supported the Stuart Restoration in 1660. Buckingham was imprisoned by Charles on several occasions before rising to be one of his most influential advisors, becoming a key member of the Cabal ministry in 1668. In 1674 he was dismissed and driven into political opposition.

He was restored to the king&#x27;s favour in 1684, but took no major part in public life after the accession of James II a year later. Buckingham had a lifelong interest in science and poetry, and was the author of several satires and plays.
==Life==
===Early life===

George was the son of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, favourite of James I and Charles I, and his wife Katherine Manners. He was only seven months old when his father was assassinated at Portsmouth by the disaffected officer John Felton. Subsequently, he was brought up in the royal household of Charles I, together with his younger brother Francis and the King&#x27;s own children, the future Charles II and James II. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained the degree of Master of Arts in 1642. For a time he was taught geometry by Thomas Hobbes. During this time he was also acquainted with George Aglionby, whose influence he later accredited with persuading him to follow the English King in the Civil War.

=== Involvement in the English Civil War ===
In the Civil War he fought for the King, and took part in Prince Rupert of the Rhine&#x27;s attack on Lichfield Close in April 1643.

Under the care of the Earl of Northumberland, George and his brother travelled abroad and lived in Florence and Rome. When the Second English Civil War broke out they joined Royalists under the command of Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland in Surrey, in July 1648.

Holland scraped together a small force of 600 men and appointed Buckingham as his General of the Horse. This force was scattered after a minor engagement near Kingston upon Thames in which Buckingham&#x27;s brother Francis was killed. Buckingham himself escaped after a heroic stand against six Roundhead opponents, his back against an oak tree, which became the stuff of Cavalier legend. After another doomed combat at St Neots the Duke succeeded in escaping to the Netherlands.

=== Exile with Charles II ===
Because of his participation in the rebellion, his lands, which had been restored to him in 1647 on account of his youth, were confiscated and given to his future father-in-law, Thomas, Lord Fairfax. On 19 September 1649, Charles II conferred on him the Order of the Garter (KG) and admitted him to his Privy Council on 6 April 1650.

In opposition to Hyde, Buckingham supported the alliance with the Scottish Presbyterians, accompanied Charles to Scotland in June, and allied himself with the Marquess of Argyll, dissuading Charles from joining the Royalist plot of October 1650, and being suspected of betraying the plan to the covenanting leaders. That May, he had been appointed general of the eastern association in England, and was sent to raise forces abroad; the following year, he was chosen to lead the projected movement in Lancashire and to command the Scottish royalists. He fought alongside Charles at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651, but escaped alone to Rotterdam in October.

His subsequent negotiations with Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s government, and his readiness to sacrifice the interests of the church, separated him from the rest of Charles&#x27;s advisers and diminished his influence. His estrangement from the royal family was completed by his audacious courtship of the king&#x27;s widowed sister Mary, Princess of Orange, and by a money dispute with Charles.

=== Return and imprisonment ===
In 1657, he returned to England, and on 15 September married Mary, daughter of Anne and Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron, who had fallen in love with him although the banns of her intended marriage with Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Chesterfield were being called in church. Buckingham was soon suspected of organizing a Presbyterian plot against the government. An order was issued for his arrest on 9 October, despite Fairfax&#x27;s interest with Cromwell. He was placed under house arrest at York House in April 1658, escaped, and was rearrested on 18 August. He was then imprisoned in the Tower of London until his mother and father-in-law negotiated his release on 23 February 1659. He was freed after promising not to assist the enemies of the government, and on Fairfax&#x27;s security of £20,000. He joined Fairfax in his march against General John Lambert in January 1660, and afterwards claimed to have gained Fairfax to the cause of the Restoration.

=== After the Restoration===
The returning King Charles at first received Buckingham (who met him at his landing at Dover) coldly, but Buckingham was soon back in favour. He was appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber, carried the Sovereign&#x27;s Orb at the coronation on 23 April 1661, and was made Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire on 21 September. The same year, he accompanied Princess Henrietta to Paris to marry the Duke of Orleans, but made such shameless advances to her that he was recalled. On 28 April 1662, he was admitted to the privy council. His confiscated estates, amounting to £26,000 a year, were restored to him, and he was said to be the king&#x27;s richest subject. He helped suppress the projected insurrection in Yorkshire in 1663, went to sea in the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665, and took measures to resist the Dutch or French invasion in June 1666.

He was, however, debarred from high office by the influence of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, the Chancellor. Buckingham now plotted to effect the Chancellor&#x27;s ruin. He organized parties in both Houses of Parliament to support the Importation Act 1667 prohibiting the import of Irish cattle, partly to oppose Clarendon and partly to thwart the Duke of Ormonde. Having asserted during the debates that &quot;whoever was against the bill had either an Irish interest or an Irish understanding&quot;, he was challenged to a duel by Ormonde&#x27;s son Lord Ossory. Buckingham avoided the encounter, and Ossory was sent to the Tower. A short time afterwards, during a conference between the two Houses on 19 December, he came to blows with the Marquess of Dorchester: Buckingham pulled off the marquess&#x27;s periwig, and Dorchester also &quot;had much of the duke&#x27;s hair in his hand.&quot; According to Clarendon, no misdemeanour so flagrant had ever before offended the dignity of the House of Lords. The offending peers were both sent to the Tower, but were released after apologising; and Buckingham vented his spite by raising a claim to the title of Baron Ros, held by Dorchester&#x27;s son-in-law. His opposition to the government had lost him the king&#x27;s favour, and he was now accused of treasonable intrigues, and of having cast the king&#x27;s horoscope. His arrest was ordered on 25 February 1667, and he was dismissed from all his offices. He avoided capture until 27 June, when he gave himself up and was imprisoned in the Tower.

He was released by 17 July, was restored to favour and to his appointments on 15 September, and took an active part in the prosecution of Clarendon. When Clarendon fell, he became the chief minister, even though he held no high office except that of Master of the Horse, bought from the Duke of Albemarle in 1668.

Villiers was a signatory to &quot;The Several Declarations of The Company of Royal Adventurers of England Trading into Africa&quot;, a document published in 1667 which led to the creation of the Royal Africa Company.

In 1671 he was elected chancellor of Cambridge, and in 1672 high steward of the University of Oxford. He favoured religious toleration, and earned the praise of Richard Baxter; he supported a scheme of comprehension in 1668, and advised the Royal Declaration of Indulgence in 1672. He upheld the original jurisdiction of the Lords in Skinner&#x27;s Case. With these exceptions, Buckingham&#x27;s tenure of office was chiefly marked by scandals and intrigues. His illicit connection with the Countess of Shrewsbury led to a duel with her husband the Earl at Barn Elms on 16 January 1668, in which the Earl was fatally wounded. The tale that the countess witnessed the encounter disguised as a page appears to have no foundation; but Buckingham provoked outrage when he installed the &quot;widow of his own creation&quot; in his own and his wife&#x27;s house, and sent his wife to her father&#x27;s house.

Buckingham was thought to be behind the idea of obtaining the divorce of the childless queen, Catherine of Braganza (though this never happened). He intrigued against James, Duke of York, against Sir William Coventry—one of the ablest statesmen of the time, whose fall he procured by provoking Coventry to send him a challenge—and against the Duke of Ormonde, who was dismissed in 1669. He was even suspected of having instigated Thomas Blood&#x27;s attempt to kidnap and murder Ormonde, and was charged with the crime in the king&#x27;s presence by Ormonde&#x27;s son, Lord Ossory, who threatened to shoot him dead in the event of his father&#x27;s meeting with a violent end. Arlington, next to Buckingham himself the most powerful member of the &quot;Cabal&quot; and a favourite of the king, was less easy to overcome; and he derived considerable influence from the control of foreign affairs entrusted to him. Buckingham always had been an adherent of the French alliance, while Arlington concluded through Sir William Temple the Triple Alliance of 1668. On the complete &quot;volte-face&quot; and surrender made by Charles to France in 1670, Arlington, a Roman Catholic, was entrusted with the first Treaty of Dover of 20 May—which besides providing for the united attack on the Dutch Republic, included Charles&#x27;s undertaking to proclaim himself a Catholic and to reintroduce the Roman Catholic faith into England,—while Buckingham was sent to France to carry on the sham negotiations which led to the public treaties of 31 December 1670 and 2 February 1672. He was much pleased with his reception by Louis XIV, declared that he had &quot;more honours done him than ever were given to any subject&quot;, and, was presented with a pension of 10,000 livres a year for Lady Shrewsbury.

In June 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he accompanied Arlington to Nieuwerbrug to impose terms on the Prince of Orange, and when these were refused with Arlington arranged a new treaty, the Accord of Heeswijk with Louis. After all this activity he suffered a keen disappointment in being passed over for the command of the newly formed Blackheath Army in favour of the Duke of Schomberg. Buckingham was given command of a regiment, but resented serving under Schomberg. He now knew of the secret treaty of Dover, and towards the end of 1673, his jealousy of Arlington became open hostility. He threatened to impeach him, and endeavoured with the help of Louis to stir up a faction against him in parliament.

===Downfall ===
This, however, was unsuccessful, and in January 1674 both houses of Parliament attacked Buckingham. In the Lords, the trustees of the young Earl of Shrewsbury complained that Buckingham publicly continued his affair with the Countess, and that a son of theirs had been buried in Westminster Abbey with the title of Earl of Coventry; Buckingham and the countess were required to apologize and give security for £10,000 not to cohabit together again. In the House of Commons he was attacked as the promoter of the French alliance, of &quot;popery&quot; and arbitrary government. He defended himself chiefly by endeavouring to blame Arlington; but the house approved a petition to the king to remove Buckingham from his councils, presence and from employment forever. Charles, who had been waiting for a favourable opportunity, and who was enraged at Buckingham&#x27;s disclosures, quickly consented.

Buckingham retired, reformed his ways, attended church with his wife, began to pay his debts, became a &quot;patriot&quot;, and was claimed by the country or opposition party as one of their leaders. In the spring of 1675 he was conspicuous for his opposition to the Test Oath and for his abuse of the bishops, and on 16 November he introduced a bill for the relief of the nonconformists. On 15 February 1677 he was one of the four lords who tried to embarrass the government by raising the question of whether the parliament, not having assembled according to the act of Edward III once in the year, had not been dissolved by the recent prorogation. The motion was rejected and the four lords were ordered to apologize. When they refused, they were sent to the Tower, Buckingham, in particular, exasperating the House by ridiculing its censure. He was released in July, and immediately entered into intrigues with Paul Barillon, the French ambassador, with the object of hindering the grant of supplies to the king; and in 1678 he visited Paris to get the assistance of Louis XIV for the opposition&#x27;s cause.

He took an active part in prosecuting those implicated in the &quot;Popish Plot&quot;, and accused the lord chief justice (Sir William Scroggs) in his own court while on circuit of favouring the Roman Catholics. Because of this, a writ was issued for his arrest, but it was never served. He promoted the return of Whig candidates to Parliament, constituted himself the champion of the dissenters, and was admitted a Freeman of the City of London. He, however, separated himself from the Whigs on the exclusion question, probably on account of his dislike of the Duke of Monmouth and the Earl of Shaftesbury, was absent from the great debate in the Lords on 15 November 1680, and was restored to the king&#x27;s favour in 1684.

===Retirement===

He took no part in public life after James II&#x27;s accession, but returned to his manor of Helmsley in Yorkshire, probably because of poor health and exhausted finances. In 1685 he published a pamphlet, entitled &quot;A short Discourse on the Reasonableness of Man&#x27;s having a Religion&quot; in which after discussing the main subject he returned to his favourite topic, religious toleration. The tract provoked some rejoinders and was defended, amongst others, by William Penn, and by the author himself in &quot;The Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s Letter to the unknown author of a short answer to the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s Paper&quot; (1685). In hopes of converting him to Roman Catholicism, James sent him a priest, but Buckingham ridiculed his arguments. He died on 16 April 1687, from a chill caught while hunting, in the house of a tenant in Kirkbymoorside in Yorkshire (it is known as Buckingham House and it is located in the town centre), expressing great repentance and feeling himself &quot;despised by my country and I fear forsaken by my God&quot;.

The miserable picture of his end drawn by Alexander Pope is greatly exaggerated. Buckingham was buried on 7 June 1687 in Henry VII&#x27;s chapel in Westminster Abbey, with greater splendour than the late king. With his death, the family founded by the extraordinary rise to power and influence of the first duke ended. As he left no legitimate children, the title became extinct, and his great estate was completely dissipated; of the enormous mansion he constructed at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire only the arcaded terrace remains.

== Character ==

Buckingham was one of the archetypal Restoration rakes, part of the &quot;Merry Gang&quot; of courtiers whose other members included John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, Sir Charles Sedley, Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, and the playwrights William Wycherley and George Etherege. Following the tone set by the monarch himself, these men distinguished themselves in drinking, sex and witty conversation. Buckingham is often judged ostentatious, licentious, and unscrupulous, the &quot;Alcibiades of the seventeenth century&quot;. One occasion saw Buckingham invite a man to a pub in Newmarket to distract him while his friend Rochester sneaked into the man&#x27;s home, drugged his sister, robbed the house, seduced his wife, and then brought his wife to the pub so that Buckingham could also have sex with her. The woman&#x27;s husband later committed suicide.

But even the duke&#x27;s critics agree that he was good-humoured, good-natured, generous, an unsurpassed mimic, and the leader of fashion. His good looks and amusing wit made him irresistible to his contemporaries, in spite of his moral faults and even crimes. A contemporary observer at the Court of Charles II found him: &quot;Courteous, affable, generous, magnanimous...he is adored by the people...On the other hand he is an atheist, blasphemer, violent, cruel and infamous for his licentiousness, in which he is so wrapped up that there is no sex, nor age, nor condition of persons who are spared from it&quot;. His portrait has been drawn by Burnet, Count Hamilton in the &quot;Memoires de Grammont&quot;, John Dryden, Alexander Pope in the &quot;Epistle to Lord Bathurst&quot;, and Sir Walter Scott in &quot;Peveril of the Peak&quot;. John Reresby calls him &quot;the first gentleman of person and wit I think I ever saw&quot;, and Burnet bears the same testimony. Dean Lockier, after alluding to his unrivalled skill in riding, dancing and fencing, adds, &quot;When he came into the presence-chamber it was impossible for you not to follow him with your eye as he went along, he moved so gracefully&quot;. Racing and hunting were his favourite sports, and his name long survived in the hunting songs of Yorkshire.

The Duke was the patron of Abraham Cowley, Thomas Sprat, Matthew Clifford and William Wycherley. He dabbled in chemistry and set up the Vauxhall glassworks at Lambeth, (see below). John Dryden described him under the character of Zimri in lines in the poem &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; (to which Buckingham replied in &quot;Poetical Reflections on a late Poem ... by a Person of Honour&quot;, 1682):

&quot;He saw and approved the best&quot;, says Brian Fairfax, &quot;but did too often (Latin &gt; &quot;follow the worst&quot;)&quot;. Buckingham himself wrote &quot;Methinks, I see the wanton houres flee, And as they passe, turne back and laugh at me&quot;; his last recorded words, &quot;O! what a prodigal have I been of that most valuable of all possessions—Time!&quot;

==Works==
Buckingham wrote occasional verses, pamphlets, lampoons, satires and plays showing undoubted (but undeveloped) poetic gifts, a collection of which, containing however many pieces not from his pen, was first published by Tom Brown in 1704; while a few extracts from a commonplace book of Buckingham of some interest are given in an article in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; of January 1898. He was the author of &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;, an amusing and clever satire on the heroic drama and especially on Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot; (first performed on 7 December 1671, at the Theatre Royal, and first published in 1672), a deservedly popular play which was imitated by Henry Fielding in &quot;Tom Thumb the Great&quot;, and by Sheridan in &quot;The Critic&quot;. It is believed that Samuel Butler had a hand in it. Dryden had his revenge in his picture of Buckingham as Zimri in &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;. Buckingham also published two adapted plays: a version of John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Chances&quot; (1682) and &quot;The Restoration or Right will take place&quot;, from Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Philaster&quot; (publ. 1714); and also &quot;The Battle of Sedgmoor&quot; and &quot;The Militant Couple&quot; (publ. 1704). The latest edition of his works is that by T. Evans (2 vols. 8vo, 1775). Another work is named by Wood, &quot;A Demonstration of the Deity&quot;, of which there is now no trace.

== Scientific interests ==
The Duke had a lifelong interest in science, acquired during the civil war, while he was exiled in France. There, he carried out a variety of laboratory experiments assisted by Prince Charles (the future Charles II). He was especially interested in alchemy, and hoped to find a method of producing the philosopher&#x27;s stone This obsession with alchemy continued throughout his lifetime so that his frequent absences from court, mistakenly attributed to visits to a lover were, very often, periods when the Duke was engrossed in his experiments.

During his lifetime, Buckingham set up a number of laboratories, where he would carry out his experiments. The first was a purpose-built facility in the grounds of Fairfax Hall, which he had acquired through his marriage to Mary Fairfax, the daughter of Lord Fairfax. He also had a laboratory installed in Wallingord House, in Westminster, a property which was restored to him after the restoration of the monarchy. Later in life, when he was out of favour at court, he retired back to Fairfax Hall to pursue his favourite pastimes, hunting and working in his laboratory. Later still, when he was sent to the Tower, accused of treason, he was permitted to set up his own private laboratory, so he could continue with his experiments.

In addition to his personal interests, Buckingham was also involved with the wider scientific activities of the time. He was appointed a fellow of the Royal Society on 15 May 1661. The society listed his specialist expertise as &quot;Chemical&quot;. The duke maintained a regular but low-level interest in the society. For example, he was requested by the society, to instruct his chemist to distil charcoal for their weekly experiments and to supply a sample of unicorn horn for investigation by the members. Later, on 4 December 1666, the Earl of Northampton and the Bishop of Exeter were tasked with asking the Duke to accommodate the society with some rooms in York House, Strand.

The Duke had other scientific activities including his frequent visits to the king&#x27;s own laboratory, which was situated in Whitehall, where he would observe the experiments and dissections in the company of the king. Also, Buckingham acquired the Vauxhall Glassworks and enlarged the factory there. Evelyn praised the quality of its products, in his diary on 19 September 1676. However, unlike king Charles, he showed no interest in botany. John Evelyn, visiting Cliveden House (which Brian Fairfax considered to be one of Buckingham&#x27;s expensive Substructiones Insanae), on 23 July 1679, was disappointed to find a garden containing mainly ferns.
Unfortunately, the many hours the Duke spent in his laboratories damaged his health, so that later in life he showed the symptoms of mercury poisoning.

== Legacy==
Like his father, the younger Duke makes an appearance in Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;Musketeer&quot; novels. &quot;The Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot; sees him escorting Charles II&#x27;s sister, Henrietta, to France to be married to Philippe I, Duke of Orléans. He is soon smitten with the young lady, which Philippe perceives quickly, and appeals to his mother, Anne of Austria. Anne, whose love for Villiers Senior was chronicled in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, convinces him that it would be best for French-English relations if he returned home. While in France, however, he earns the enmity of Comte de Wardes, whose father was the lover of Milady de Winter, who was responsible for the old Villiers&#x27; death. De Wardes escorts him to a boat destined for England, but before departing, the two men duel and de Wardes is injured.

In the 2003 British television mini-series &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot;, Villiers is portrayed by the British actor Rupert Graves.

In the 2004 motion picture &quot;Stage Beauty&quot;, Ben Chaplin plays him.

<text>Andriyan Grigoryevich Nikolayev (Chuvash and ; 5 September 1929 – 3 July 2004) was a Soviet cosmonaut. In 1962, aboard Vostok 3, he became the third Soviet cosmonaut to fly into space. Nikolayev was an ethnic Chuvash and because of it considered the first Turkic cosmonaut.

==Early life==

Andrian Grigoryevich Nikolayev was born on 5 September 1929, in Shorshely, a village in the Chuvash region of the Volga River valley, and spent his time growing up on a collective farm.

== Education and career ==

Nikolayev supported his family following the death of his father in 1944, however this was not preferred by his mother, who preferred that he earn an education. Nikolayev later entered medical school before he joined the Soviet army. During his training Nikolayev was able to maintain a very calm state during stressful situations. Nikolayev&#x27;s calm made him a fair candidate for becoming a cosmonaut. His future colleagues Yuri Gagarin, Gherman Titov, and seventeen others joined him in March 1960. Nikolayev&#x27;s future wife was cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, and he reportedly kissed her goodbye before boarding Vostok 3.

==History==

Nikolayev flew on two space flights: Vostok 3 (becoming the third Soviet cosmonaut) and Soyuz 9. His call sign in these flights was Falcon (). On both, he set new endurance records for the longest time a human being had remained in orbit. He also served as backup for the Vostok 2 and Soyuz 8 missions. On 22 January 1969, Nikolayev survived an assassination attempt on Leonid Brezhnev, undertaken by a Soviet Army deserter, Viktor Ilyin. He left the cosmonaut corps on 26 January 1982.

Nikolayev was also the first person to make a television broadcast from space, in August 1962. Vostok 3 was part the first dual space flight, with Pavel Popovich on Vostok 4.

In the early days of space travel, it was usual to place trainee astronauts into isolation chambers to see how long they could last alone. They sat in silence unable to gauge time. Many men cracked but Nikolayev lasted the longest – four days – and became known as the Iron Man.

On 3 November 1963, he married Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman to fly in space (see Vostok 6). They had one daughter, Elena Andriyanovna (now a doctor of medicine), before their marriage collapsed. However, it was not until 1982 that they divorced.

In 2004, Nikolayev died of a heart attack in Cheboksary, the capital of Chuvashia in Russia. A scandal ensued. His daughter, who lives in Moscow, desired that he be interred in the cemetery at Star City. The President of Chuvashia had other ideas. After a farewell ceremony in Cheboksary, Nikolayev was buried in his native village of Shorshely. He has no family living in the republic. Plans are in the works to move the body to Star City.

Nikolayev was also a keen skier:
Service in the Air Force made us strong, both physically and morally. All of us cosmonauts took up sports and PT seriously when we served in the Air Force. I know that Yuri Gagarin was fond of ice hockey. He liked to play goal keeper. Gherman Titov was a gymnastics enthusiast, Andriyan Nikolayev liked skiing, Pavel Popovich went in for weight lifting. I don&#x27;t think I am wrong when I say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts.

<text>Sir Charles Harding Firth (16 March 1857 – 19 February 1936) was a British historian. He was one of the founders of the Historical Association in 1906. Esmond de Beer wrote that Firth &quot;knew the men and women of the seventeenth century much as a man knows his friends and acquaintances, not only as characters but also in the whole moral and intellectual world in which they lived.&quot;

==Career==
Born in Sheffield, Firth was educated at Clifton College and at Balliol College, Oxford. At university he received the Stanhope prize for an essay on Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley in 1877 and was a member of the exclusive Stubbs Society for high-achieving historians. He became lecturer at Pembroke College in 1887, and fellow of All Souls College in 1901. He was Ford&#x27;s lecturer in English history in 1900, was elected FBA in 1903 and became Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford in succession to Frederick York Powell in 1904. Firth&#x27;s historical work was almost entirely confined to English history during the time of the English Civil War and the Commonwealth; and although he is somewhat overshadowed by S. R. Gardiner, who wrote about the same period, his books were highly regarded.

==Teaching vs scholarship==
Firth was a great friend and ally of T. F. Tout, who was professionalising the History undergraduate programme at Manchester University, especially by introducing a key element of individual study of original sources and production of a thesis. Firth&#x27;s attempts to do likewise at Oxford brought him into bitter conflict with the college fellows, who had little research expertise of their own and saw no reason why their undergraduates should be made to acquire such arcane, even artisan, skills, given their likely careers. They saw Firth as a power-seeker for the university professoriate as against the role of the colleges as proven finishing-schools for the country and empire&#x27;s future establishment. Firth failed but the twentieth century saw universities go his and Tout&#x27;s way.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1892.

He served as president of the Royal Historical Society from 1913 to 1917.

His letters to Tout are in the latter&#x27;s collection in the John Rylands Library, Manchester University.

*The standard edition of Ludlow&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot; (1894).

He also edited the &quot;Clarke Papers&quot; (1891–1901), and Mrs Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson&quot; (1885), and wrote an introduction to the &quot;Stuart Tracts, 1603–1693&quot; (1903), besides contributions to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. In 1909 he published &quot;The Last Years of the Protectorate&quot;.

Godfrey Davies, who had been Firth&#x27;s student and then his research assistant at Oxford between 1910 and 1925, edited and published Firth&#x27;s posthumously published works.

<text>A chutney () is a spread typically associated with cuisines of the Indian subcontinent. Chutneys are made in a wide variety of forms, such as a tomato relish, a ground peanut garnish, yogurt, or curd, cucumber, spicy coconut, spicy onion, or mint dipping sauce.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;chutney&quot; derives from Hindi &quot;chaṭnī&quot;, deriving from &quot;chāṭnā&quot; &#x27;to lick&#x27; or &#x27;to eat with appetite&#x27;. In India, &quot;chutney&quot; refers to fresh and pickled preparations indiscriminately; however, several Indian languages use the word for fresh preparations only.

==Overview==
In India, chutneys can be either made alongside pickles that are matured in the sun for up to two weeks and kept up to a year or, more commonly, are freshly made from fresh ingredients that can be kept a couple of days or a week in the refrigerator.

In South India, Chutneys are also known as &quot;Pachadi&quot; (, , , ) which generally refers to traditional South Indian sauces or chutneys served as side dishes. Roughly translated, it refers to a plant which has been pounded or crushed.

Pachadis are made of fresh vegetables and are served on the side for dishes like idli, dosa, and pesarattu. Many kinds of vegetables are included. Sometimes the rind of a vegetable is used, such as the peel of the ridged gourd, known as &quot;&quot; in Telugu.

In Tamil Nadu, &quot;thogayal&quot; or &quot;thuvayal&quot; (Tamil) are preparations similar to chutney but with a pasty consistency. In Kerala it is also called &quot;chammanthi&quot; and in Telangana it is called &quot;tokku&quot; or also &quot;pacchadi&quot;. &quot;Thengai chutney,&quot; a coconut-based chutney, is the one being referred to when only &#x27;chutney&#x27; is said.

Medicinal plants that are believed to have a beneficial effect are sometimes made into chutneys, for example &quot;pirandai thuvayal&quot; or ridged gourd chutney (&quot;peerkangai thuvayal&quot; or &quot;beerakaaya tokku&quot;).

Bitter gourd can also serve as a base for a chutney which is like a relish or, as a dried powder.

Occasionally, chutneys that contrast in taste and colour can be served together—a favourite combination being a green mint and chili chutney with a contrasting sweet brown tamarind and date chutney.

Chutneys may be ground with a mortar and pestle or an &quot;ammikkal&quot; (Tamil). Spices are added and ground, usually in a particular order; the wet paste thus made is sautéed in vegetable oil, usually gingelly (sesame) or peanut oil. Electric blenders or food processors can be used as labour-saving alternatives to the stone grinding technique.

Western-style chutneys are usually fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction, with added flavourings. These may include sugar, salt, garlic, tamarind, onion or ginger. Western-style chutneys originated from Anglo-Indians at the time of the British Raj. They recreated Indian chutneys using English orchard fruits—sour cooking apples and rhubarb, for example. They would often contain dried fruit: raisins, currants, and sultanas.

They were a way to use a glut of ripened fruit and preserving techniques were similar to sweet fruit preserves using approximately an equal weight of fruit and sugar, the vinegar and sugar acting as preservatives.

South Indian chutney powders are made from roasted dried lentils to be sprinkled on &quot;idlis&quot; and &quot;dosas&quot;. Peanut chutneys can be made wet or as a dry powder.

Spices commonly used in chutneys include fenugreek, coriander (also called cilantro), cumin, and asafoetida (&quot;hing&quot;). Other prominent ingredients and combinations include coriander, capsicum, mint (coriander and mint chutneys are often called हरा &quot;hara&quot; chutney, Hindi for &quot;green&quot;), Tamarind or &quot;imli&quot; (often called &quot;meethi&quot; chutney, as मिठाई &quot;meethi&quot; in Hindi means &quot;sweet&quot;), sooth (or &quot;saunth&quot;, made with dates and ginger), coconut, onion, prune, tomato, red chili, green chili, mango, lime (made from whole, unripe limes), garlic, coconut, peanut, &quot;dahi&quot; (yogurt), green tomato, &quot;dhaniya&quot; &quot;pudina&quot; (cilantro and mint), peanut (&quot;shengdana&quot; chutney in Marathi), ginger, red chili powder, tomato onion chutney, cilantro, mint coconut chutney, and apricot.

A common chutney variant in Anglo-Indian cuisine uses a tart fruit such as sharp apples, rhubarb or damson pickle made milder by an equal weight of sugar (usually demerara, turbinado or brown sugar to replace jaggery in some Indian sweet chutneys). Vinegar was added to the recipe for English-style chutney that traditionally aims to give a long shelf life so that autumn fruit can be preserved for use throughout the year (as are jams, jellies and pickles) or to be sold as a commercial product. Indian pickles use mustard oil as a pickling agent, but Anglo-Indian style chutney uses malt or cider vinegar which produces a milder product. In Western cuisine, chutney is often eaten with hard cheese or with cold meats and fowl, typically in cold pub lunches.

Major Grey&#x27;s Chutney is a type of sweet and spicy chutney popular in the United States. The recipe was reportedly created by a 19th-century British Army officer of the same name (likely apocryphal) who presumably had resided for a period of time in the Raj. Its characteristic ingredients are mango, raisins, vinegar, lime juice, onion, tamarind extract, sweetening and spices. Several companies produce a Major Grey&#x27;s Chutney, in India, the UK and the US.

== History ==

Similar in preparation and usage to a pickle, simple spiced chutneys can be dated to 500 BC. Originating in India, As greater imports of foreign and varied foods increased into northern Europe, chutney fell out of favour in Britain. This combined with a greater ability to refrigerate fresh foods and an increasing number of glasshouses meant the British consumption of chutney and pickle was relegated to army usage and individuals residing in colonial India. Chutney resurged in popularity in England around the 1780s as an appetizer.

Diego Álvarez Chanca brought back chili peppers from the Americas to Spain in 1493. He had sailed with Columbus. After discovering their medicinal properties, Chanca developed a chutney to administer them. In the early 17th century, officials of the East India Company on the Indian subcontinent subsisted on preserved foodstuffs such as lime pickles, chutneys and marmalades. (Marmalades proved unpopular due to their sweetness. They were also rare due to a lack of available sugar.) Beginning in the 17th century, fruit chutneys were shipped to various European countries as luxury goods. These imitations were called &quot;mangoed&quot; fruits or vegetables, the word &#x27;chutney&#x27; being associated with the working class in these countries.

Major Grey&#x27;s Chutney is thought to have been developed by a British officer who had travelled to the Indian subcontinent. The formula was eventually sold to Crosse and Blackwell, a major British food manufacturer, probably in the early 1800s. In the 19th century, types of chutney like Major Grey&#x27;s or Bengal Club that catered to Western tastes were shipped to Europe from the Indian subcontinent. Generally, these chutneys are fruit, vinegar, and sugar cooked down to a reduction.

== By regions of India ==


=== In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana ===

* Vegetable pachadi is made with vegetables like bottle gourd, aubergine, and okra. The vegetable is cooked al dente and is ground with roasted red/green chiles, fenugreek seeds and mustard seeds.
* Green pachadi: The most popular one is Gongura pachadi made out of red sorrel leaves and roasted red chiles, and is unique to Andhra cuisine. Other than this, chukka koora (a type of sour leafy greens found in Andhra Pradesh) pachadi is also very popular.

=== In Karnataka ===
Thambuli is a type of sauce or chutney eaten in the Indian state of Karnataka. Thambuli is a curd based dish and is usually consumed with hot rice along with hot sambar. Thambuli is derived from the Kannada word thampu ( ----&gt;), meaning cool/cold. It is made mostly from greens and carrots, beetroot like vegetables as their main ingredients. It is prepared by grinding the vegetable with the spices and then mixing it with yogurt. All ingredients are used raw (as they are) without any cooking.

Thambuli/Tambli/Tambuli is a form of sauce or chutney. There are many varieties of Thumbuli: Menthe Thumbuli, shunti (ginger) thaumbuli, and various other herbal thambulis. The herbal thambuli is prepared with leaves like , , (all of them grown in all over Karnataka).

Many different seasonal vegetables/herbs can be used in the preparation of thambulis, such as doddapatre leaves (ajwain leaves/karibevu leaves), coriander leaves, poppy seeds, curry leaves and so on. Various recipes for the same exist, with slight variations in the ingredients. Thambuli/Tambli is generally prepared mild and not spicy. Fundamentally, thambuli/tambli has a few simple whole spices, roasted and ground with seasonal vegetables or herbs (some with coconut) added to buttermilk/curds. Tambuli is another authentic Karnataka recipe.

=== In Tamil Nadu ===
In Tamil Nadu, pachadi is eaten fresh and typically made of finely chopped and boiled vegetables such as cucumber or ash gourd, with coconut, green or red chillis and fried in oil with mustard seeds, ginger and curry leaves. Pachadi is commonly eaten with rice and lentil curry.

=== In Kerala ===
In Kerala, pachadi is prepared in curd similar to Tamil Nadu. Along with sour Pachadi, there exists a sweet variant in Kerala, made with pineapple, grapes or pumpkin. Many varieties made of the same key recipe exist in different parts of Kerala. It is served at restaurants along with vegetable thali rice. It is also included with Sadhya, especially with Kerala Sadhya popular during Onam and Vishu festivals.

<text>Frederick York Powell (4 January 1850 – 8 May 1904) was an English historian and scholar.

== Biography ==

He was born on 4 January 1850 at 43 Woburn Place, Bloomsbury, London, the son of Frederick Powell, a commissariat merchant, and his wife Mary Powell, daughter of Dr James Powell. He was educated at the Manor House School at Hastings, and Rugby School. He matriculated at the University of Oxford in 1868 as an unattached student, the following year joining Christ Church, where he took a first-class degree in law and modern history in 1872. Whilst at Oxford, he was a member of the exclusive Stubbs Society.

Powell was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1874.

He became law-lecturer and tutor of Christ Church, fellow of Oriel College, delegate of the Clarendon Press, and in 1894 he was made Regius Professor of Modern History in succession to James Anthony Froude. In June 1901 he received an honorary doctorate (LLD) from the University of Glasgow during celebrations for the university&#x27;s 450th jubilee.

Powell died on 8 May 1904 at Staverton Grange, Banbury Road, Oxford, and was buried in Wolvercote. Part of his collection of artefacts were deposited at the Pitt Rivers Museum.

==Associations==
Powell took an interest in French poetry, and Paul Verlaine, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Emile Verhaeren all lectured at Oxford under his auspices. He was also a connoisseur in Japanese art. In politics his sympathies were with the oppressed of all nationalities; he had befriended refugees after the Commune, counting among his friends Jules Vallès the author of &quot;Les Réfractaires&quot;; and he was also a friend of Stepniak and his circle.

Powell was a member of the Folklore Society and became its president in the year that he died. The society&#x27;s journal, which had published his papers, printed an obituary by Edward Clodd.

==Works==
Powell&#x27;s contributions to history were not extensive, but he was a particularly stimulating teacher. He had been attracted in his school days to the study of Scandinavian history and literature, and he was closely allied with Professor Guðbrandur Vigfússon (d. 1889), whom he assisted in his &quot;Icelandic Prose Reader&quot; (1897), &quot;Corpus Poeticum Boreale&quot; (1887), and &quot;Origines Islandicae&quot; (1905), and in the editing of the &quot;Grimm Centenary&quot; papers (1886).

==Family==
Powell married in 1874 Florence Batten (née Silke). She died in 1888. They had a daughter, Mariella.

<doc id="193435" wikidata="Q267683" url="?curid=193435" title="Thomas Sprat">
<text>Thomas Sprat, FRS (163520 May 1713) was an English churchman and writer, Bishop of Rochester from 1684.

==Life==
Sprat was born at Beaminster, Dorset, and educated at Wadham College, Oxford, where he held a fellowship from 1657 to 1670. Having taken orders he became a prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral in 1660. In the preceding year he had gained a reputation by his poem &quot;To the Happie Memory of the most Renowned Prince Oliver, Lord Protector&quot; (London, 1659), and he was afterwards well known as a wit, preacher and man of letters.

In 1669 Sprat became canon of Westminster Abbey, and in 1670 rector of Uffington, Lincolnshire. He was chaplain to Charles II in 1676, curate and lecturer at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, in 1679, canon of Chapel Royal, Windsor in 1681, Dean of Westminster in 1683 and Bishop of Rochester in 1684. He was appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal in 1685 and was Clerk of the Closet from 1685 to 1687.

Sprat was a member of James II&#x27;s ecclesiastical commission, and in 1688 he read the &quot;Declaration of Indulgence&quot; to empty benches in Westminster Abbey. The suggestion was that he was playing at being Vicar of Bray. Although he opposed the motion of 1689 declaring the throne vacant, he assisted at the coronation of William and Mary. As Dean of Westminster he directed Christopher Wren&#x27;s restoration of the abbey.

In 1692 a bizarre attempt was made to implicate Sprat in a plot to restore the deposed king James II. This became known as the &quot;flowerpot plot&quot; because it involved a conspirator—a man named Robert Young—forging Sprat&#x27;s signature on a document, smuggling it into the Bishop&#x27;s manor and hiding the paper under a flowerpot. The authorities were contacted about the document, which led to the Bishop&#x27;s arrest for high treason and the searching of his house—the forged document was eventually found where Young had said it would be. However, Sprat was soon freed when it became clear that there was no case to answer.

He died of apoplexy in 1713 at the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in Bromley, Kent and was buried on the south side of St Nicholas&#x27; Chapel in Westminster Abbey. The monument is by Francis Bird.

==Works==

Sprat&#x27;s major prose works are the &quot;Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier&#x27;s Voyage into England&quot; (London, 1665), a satirical reply to the strictures on Englishmen in Samuel de Sorbière&#x27;s book &quot;Relation d&#x27;un voyage en Angleterre&quot; (Paris, 1664), and a &quot;History of the Royal Society of London&quot; (London, 1667), which Sprat had helped to found. The &quot;History of the Royal Society&quot; elaborates the scientific purposes of the academy and outlines some of the strictures of scientific writing that set the modern standards for clarity and conciseness.

A collection of ten of his sermons was published in 1710. 

For his work on the history of science he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1663.

==Family==
He married Helen, the daughter of Devereux Wolseley of Ravenstone, Staffordshire and was the father of Thomas Sprat, Archdeacon of Rochester and Fellow of the Royal Society. Shortly after the elder Sprat&#x27;s death, his son was made a canon of Westminster Abbey.

<text>Terence Nelhams Wright (23 June 1940 – 8 March 2003), known as Adam Faith, was an English singer, actor, and financial journalist. As a British rock and roll teen idol, he scored consecutive No. 1 hits on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;What Do You Want?&quot; (1959) and &quot;Poor Me&quot; (1960). He became the first UK artist to lodge his initial seven hits in the top 5, and was ultimately one of the most charted acts of the 1960s. He was also one of the first UK acts to record original songs regularly.

Faith also maintained an acting career, appearing as Dave in the teen exploitation film &quot;Beat Girl&quot; (1960), the eponymous lead in the ITV television series &quot;Budgie&quot; (1971–1972) and Frank Carver in the BBC comedy drama &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (1992–1994).

==Early life and education==
Terence Nelhams Wright was born on 23 June 1940 at 4, East Churchfield Road, Acton, Middlesex (now included in London), England, son of coach driver Alfred Richard Nelhams and cleaner Ellen May (née Burridge), formerly wife of Cecil G. Wright, from whom she was separated but not divorced. Unmarried at the births of all their children, his parents were married in 1953.

Known as Terry Nelhams, he was unaware his name was Terence Nelhams Wright until he applied for a passport and obtained his birth certificate. The third in a family of five children, Nelhams grew up in a council house in a working class area of London, where he attended John Perryn Junior School. He had his first job at 12, delivering and selling newspapers part-time while still at school. His first full-time job was odd-job boy for a silk screen printer.

==Music career==
Faith became one of Britain&#x27;s significant early pop stars. At the time, he was distinctive for his hiccupping glottal stops and exaggerated pronunciation. He did not write his own material, and much of his early success was through partnership with songwriters Les Vandyke and John Barry, whose arrangements were inspired by the pizzicato arrangements for Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter Anymore&quot;.

Faith began his musical career in 1957, while working as a film cutter in London in the hope of becoming an actor, singing with and managing a skiffle group, the Worried Men. The group played in Soho coffee bars after work, and became the resident band at the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar, where they appeared on the BBC Television live music programme &quot;Six-Five Special&quot;. The producer, Jack Good, was impressed by the singer and arranged a solo recording contract with HMV under the name Adam Faith. According to Faith&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Good showed him a book of names, and the aspiring singer picked &quot;Adam&quot; from the boys&#x27; list, and &quot;Faith&quot; from the girls&#x27; list.

His debut record &quot;(Got a) Heartsick Feeling&quot; and &quot;Brother Heartache and Sister Tears&quot;, in January 1958, failed to make the charts. Good gave him a part in the stage show of &quot;Six-Five Special&quot;, along with the John Barry Seven but the show folded after four performances. His second release later that year was a cover of Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s &quot;High School Confidential&quot;, backed with the Burt Bacharach and Hal David penned &quot;Country Music Holiday&quot; but this also failed.

Faith returned to work as a film cutter at National Studios at Elstree until March 1959, when Barry invited him to audition for a BBC TV rock and roll show, &quot;Drumbeat&quot;. The producer, Stewart Morris, gave him a contract for three shows, extended to the full 22-week run. His contract with HMV had ended, and he sang one track, &quot;I Vibrate&quot;, on a six-track EP released by the Fontana record label. Barry&#x27;s manager, Eve Taylor, got him a contract with Top Rank, but his only record there, &quot;Ah, Poor Little Baby&quot;/&quot;Runk Bunk&quot; produced by Tony Hatch, failed to chart due to a lack of publicity caused by a national printing strike.

Despite the failure, Faith was becoming popular through television appearances. He became an actor by taking drama and elocution lessons. The script called for Faith to sing songs and, because Barry was arranging Faith&#x27;s recordings and live &quot;Drumbeat&quot; material, the film company asked him to write the score. That was the beginning of Barry&#x27;s notable career in film music.

Faith&#x27;s success on &quot;Drumbeat&quot; enabled another recording contract, with Parlophone. His next record in 1959, &quot;What Do You Want?&quot;, written by Les Vandyke and produced by Barry and John Burgess, received good reviews in the &quot;NME&quot; and other papers, as well as being voted a hit on &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;. This became his first number one hit in the UK Singles Chart, and his pronunciation of the word &#x27;baby&#x27; as &#x27;bay-beh&#x27; became a catchphrase.

&quot;What Do You Want?&quot; was the first number one hit for Parlophone, Faith the only pop act on the label. With his next two single releases, &quot;Poor Me&quot; (another chart topper) and &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Baby&quot; (a UK No. 2), Faith established himself as a prominent rival to Cliff Richard in British popular music.
A UK variety tour was followed by a 12-week season at Blackpool Hippodrome in the summer of 1960 and an appearance on the &quot;Royal Variety Show&quot;. In October, he appeared in the film &quot;Beat Girl&quot;.

Faith&#x27;s next release was a double A-side single, &quot;Made You&quot;/&quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;, which made the top ten, despite a BBC ban for &quot;Made You&quot; for &#x27;a lewd and salacious lyric&#x27;. His 1960 novelty record &quot;Lonely Pup (In a Christmas Shop&quot;), to coincide with his Christmas pantomime, gained a silver disc. His début album &quot;Adam&quot; was released on 4 November 1960 to critical acclaim for the inventiveness of Barry&#x27;s arrangements and Faith&#x27;s own performances. The material ranged from standards such as &quot;Summertime&quot;, &quot;Hit the Road to Dreamland&quot; and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; to more contemporary songs, such as Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, Johnny Worth&#x27;s &quot;Fare Thee Well My Pretty Maid&quot;, and Howard Guyton&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Time&quot;.

At the age of 20 and living with his parents, he bought a house close to Hampton Court for £6,000, where he moved with his family from their house in Acton. In December 1960, he became the first pop artist to appear on the TV interview series &quot;Face to Face&quot; with John Freeman. Faith made six further albums and 35 singles, with a total of 24 chart entries, of which 11 made the UK top ten, including his two number ones. Ten of the eleven singles that made the top ten actually also made the top 5. Faith managed to lodge twenty consecutive single releases on the UK Singles Chart, starting with &quot;What Do You Want?&quot; in November 1959 and culminating with &quot;I Love Being in Love with You&quot; in mid-1964; this was quite a feat for a British artist of Faith&#x27;s era.

Faith&#x27;s last top ten hit in the UK (in October 1963) was &quot;The First Time&quot; (UK No. 5), which was also his first single with his backing group in 1963 and 1964, the Roulettes, acquired to give Faith&#x27;s music a harder &#x27;beat group&#x27; edge more in keeping with the Merseybeat sound at that time sweeping the British charts. His 1974 single &quot;I Survived&quot; made the top 30 of the &quot;Capital Countdown&quot; on London&#x27;s Capital Radio.

Benefiting from the enthusiasm of American audiences for all artists British at the height of the British Invasion in 1964–1965, Faith managed to register one single in the top 40 of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright&quot; (which was not released as a single in his native UK). Faith&#x27;s teen pop became less popular in the mid-1960s in competition with the Beatles. His final top-40 single in the UK was &quot;Someone&#x27;s Taken Maria Away&quot; in 1965. In 1967, he recorded the psychedelic-sounding &quot;Cowman, Milk Your Cow&quot;, which was written by Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb and released as a single in September that same year. The following year, Faith parted company with EMI.

During the 1970s, Faith went into music management, managing Leo Sayer among others. Faith negotiated an advance for his own comeback album with Warner Bros. Records, using half of it to record the album &quot;I Survive&quot; (which failed to chart) and the other half to finance Sayer. Faith and his former drummer David Courtney co-produced Sayer&#x27;s initial hits &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; and &quot;One Man Band&quot;. Sayer later said in an interview with British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that &quot;[Faith] handled everything for me, but although he was a very good mentor, he was less trustworthy with my money. In the end, Adam Faith made more out of Leo Sayer than I did.&quot; Faith also co-produced Roger Daltrey&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Daltrey&quot; which included the hit single &quot;Giving It All Away&quot; penned by Sayer.

==Film, television, and theatre career==
While pursuing his musical career, Faith appeared in supporting roles in films such as &quot;Beat Girl&quot; (1960) and &quot;Never Let Go&quot; (1960), and television dramas such as the Rediffusion/ITV series &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;. In 1961, Faith starred in &quot;What a Whopper&quot;, supported by Sid James, Spike Milligan, Wilfrid Brambell, Carole Lesley and others well known at the time. A comedy about a writer staging a fake sighting of the Loch Ness Monster, it was written by Terry Nation, and had music by John Barry; Faith sang the title song and &quot;The Time Has Come&quot;. He also made a last-minute guest appearance in &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; (1961) with Sid James and Kenneth Connor.

In 1962, Faith co-starred opposite Donald Sinden and Anne Baxter in the film &quot;Mix Me a Person&quot;, playing a working-class youth falsely accused of murder. The thriller was rated X-certificate (the modern equivalent would be a UK 18-certificate) by the British Board of Film Censors. Following Faith&#x27;s 1968 departure from his record label EMI, he concentrated on acting, particularly repertory theatre. After a number of small parts, he was given a more substantial role in the play &quot;Night Must Fall&quot;, playing opposite Dame Sybil Thorndike. In autumn 1969, he took the lead in a touring production of &quot;Billy Liar&quot;. Faith starred as the eponymous hero in the early 1970s television series &quot;Budgie&quot; (LWT/ITV), about an ex-convict. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1971 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

Faith&#x27;s acting career declined after a 1973 motor car accident in which he almost lost a leg. He restarted with a role in &quot;Stardust&quot; (1974) as the manipulative manager of rock star David Essex, for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award. Despite this success, he remained reluctant to act for some years, and turned back to music-related ventures.

In 1980, he starred with Roger Daltrey in &quot;McVicar&quot;, and again played a rock band manager in &quot;Foxes&quot;, starring Jodie Foster as his daughter. Faith played the role of James Crane in the 1985 TV movie &quot;Minder on the Orient Express&quot; – part of the &quot;Minder&quot; franchise. From 1992 to 1994, he appeared in another TV series, &quot;Love Hurts&quot;, starring with Zoë Wanamaker. In 2002, he appeared in the BBC series &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Murder in Mind&quot;.
==Later years==
Faith married Jackie Irving in 1967 and they had one daughter, Katya Faith, who became a television producer. By the 1980s, Faith had become an investor and financial adviser. In 1986, he was hired as a financial journalist by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and its sister paper &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. Faith and business partner, Paul Killik, were the principal investors behind failed UK television station &quot;Money Channel&quot;. When the channel closed in June 2002, Faith was declared bankrupt, owing a reported £32 million. English film director and producer Michael Winner stated that Faith was his investment adviser, leading to significant losses on two different investments.

==Death==
Faith had heart surgery in 1986. On 7 March 2003, he became ill after his evening stage performance in the touring production of &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; at Stoke-on-Trent. Faith died, aged 62, of a heart attack early the next morning, 8 March 2003, at North Staffordshire Hospital. His last words have since become famous and are often quoted: &quot;Channel 5 is all shit, isn&#x27;t it? Christ, the crap they put on there. It&#x27;s a waste of space&quot;. It was reported after his death that the married star&#x27;s 23-year-old mistress had been in his hotel room the night he was taken ill.

<doc id="193439" wikidata="Q182115" url="?curid=193439" title="Mila Rodino">
<text>&quot;&quot; ( ; ) is the national anthem of Bulgaria. It was composed and written by Tsvetan Radoslavov as he left to fight in the Serbo-Bulgarian War in 1885. It was adopted in 1964. Its lyrics have been changed many times, most recently in 1990. On 12 July 1991, the anthem was shortened to its first verse along with the chorus.

Between 1886 and 1947, &quot;Šumi Marica&quot; was used as the Bulgarian national anthem; from 1951 to 1964, &quot;Bǎlgarijo Mila&quot; was used; and for a short time between 1947 and 1951, the march &quot;Republiko naša, zdravej!&quot; was used.

== History ==
=== Creation ===
The song was created by scientist and composer Tsvetan Radoslavov in 1885, after his participation in the Serbo-Bulgarian War. He was inspired to create the song based on his poems when he saw Serbian students singing their own patriotic song on their journey home. It was first printed in 1895 in Part I of &quot;Music Textbook&quot; by K. Mahan.

=== Adoption ===
In the 1960s, after the de-Stalinization process, the poet Georgi Dzhagarov began an effort to replace the previous anthem, which was based on the State Anthem of the Soviet Union and included references to Joseph Stalin. After discussing with Todor Zhivkov, General Secretary Zhivkov accepted the idea. On 29 March 1962, the Council of Ministers held a competition for the lyrics and the music for the new anthem, with the deadline for the submission of lyrics on 1 May 1963 and the music on 1 November 1963. The committee for the new anthem was selected by Zhivkov himself. The lyrics for the new anthem were finalized on 1 September 1963, and the music was finalized on 1 March 1964. The Council of Ministers also drew up a panel of experts to look at the projects submitted in advance and to put the best of the proposals to discussion amongst the committee.

After the proposals for the lyrics and the music were submitted, the committee was not satisfied, so they accepted the advice of Georgi Dzhagarov to use &quot;Mila Rodino&quot; as the music for the new anthem. The duty of composing lyrics was assigned to Georgi Dzhagarov and Dmitry Metodiev, while the melody of the anthem was revised with further harmonization by Philip Kutev and Alexander Raichev.

Under Zhivkov&#x27;s orders, Georgi Dzhagarov and Dimitar Metodiev resided in the Vrana Palace to compose the text of &quot;Mila Rodino&quot;.

During the composition of the lyrics, Georgi Dzhagarov was not particularly proud of his creation. He preferred the anthem without the mentions of the Soviet Union and the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party in the third verse of the anthem. An alternate version of the third verse can be found in Dzhagarov&#x27;s manuscript.
The final composition of the lyrics consisted of the original first verse and the chorus of the anthem by Tsvetan Radoslavov, as well as two new verses: the second verse references the fight for Bulgarian independence and the fight against fascism during World War II, and the third verse references the Communist Party of the Soviet Union along with the Communist Party of Bulgaria.

In 1964, before the affirmation of &quot;Mila Rodino&quot; as the national anthem, the decision met resistance from Petko Staynov. Staynov argued that the melody is of Ashkenazi Jewish origin and this makes the song not suitable for being the anthem of Bulgaria. Dobri Hristov countered the argument, stating that there are hundreds of melodies in Bulgarian songs which are borrowed from other people and thus became an integral part of the Bulgarian musical heritage. This statement led to Staynov being removed from the committee for the new anthem by Todor Zhivkov.

On 8 September 1964, &quot;Mila Rodino&quot; was finally affirmed by the Presidium of the National Assembly, with the Decree No. 534, as the national anthem of Bulgaria. The first performance of the song as the national anthem of Bulgaria took place on 9 September 1964, the 20th anniversary of the Socialist Revolution of 9 September.

== Proposals ==
During the discussion for the new constitution of Bulgaria in the 7th Grand National Assembly, there are some proposals submitted for a new anthem. The proposals include &quot;Šumi Marica&quot; and &quot;Vǎrvi, narode vǎzrodeni&quot;.

The most recent one was the petition by writer Nikola Indzhov to change the anthem of Bulgaria to &quot;Vǎrvi, narode vǎzrodeni&quot;, the anthem of the Bulgarian Enlightenment.

== Regulation ==
=== Current regulation ===
According to the Institutional Identity of the Administration of the State of Bulgaria, there are two versions of the anthem, the full and the abridged version.

* The official version of the anthem in an instrumental rendition for wind orchestra is performed by the Brass Orchestra of the National Guard.

The anthem cannot be used as part of another melody or song, nor to be remixed with different lyrics other than the legally established ones.

=== Original regulation ===
The first regulation on the anthem came from Decree No. 534 &quot;On the approval of the text and the music of the national anthem of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria&quot;, which was published on 8 September 1964.

==Lyrics==
===Current official===
The anthem currently officially consists of the first verse and chorus. During communist rule, two additional verses (II and III) were added that referred to Moscow (under direct instructions of Todor Zhivkov) and the Bulgarian Communist Party, as well as the fallen fighters for Bulgaria through the years. After the changes in 1989, this part of the anthem was removed and forbidden to be performed.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1975 was the 20th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 22 March 1975 in the in Stockholm, Sweden and presented by Karin Falck. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (SR), the contest was held in Sweden following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Waterloo&quot; by ABBA. Nineteen countries were represented at the contesta new record number of participants. made its first entry in the contest, and and returned after a one- and two-year absence, respectively. , after participating for the first time in the previous year&#x27;s event, opted not to participate in 1975, due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974.

The winner was the with the song &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot;, composed by Dick Bakker, written by and Eddy Ouwens, and performed by the group Teach-In. This was the Netherlands&#x27; fourth contest victory, matching the record number of contest wins previously set by France and . Having been the opening song of the contest, it was also the first time that a country had won from first position in the running order. The , , France and Luxembourg rounded out the top five positions, with the UK achieving a record-extending ninth second-place finish. A new voting system was introduced at this contest; each country gave 12 points to its favourite, 10 points to its second favourite, and then 8 points to 1 point to other countries in descending order of preference. This numerical order of awarded points has since been used in every subsequent edition of the contest.

== Location ==

The 1975 contest took place in Stockholm, Sweden, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Waterloo&quot; performed by ABBA. It was the first time that Sweden had hosted the event. The chosen venue was the , an exhibition centre in the Älvsjö district of southern Stockholm opened in 1971; in 1976 the venue was renamed to .

The Swedish broadcaster (SR) had initially been reluctant to stage the event, mainly due to the high costs that came with it which would have been placed on the organisation. There had also been considerable pressure and disquiet from left-wing groups in the country that initially opposed the amount of money being spent by the public broadcaster on a commercial event, which subsequently developed into a wider protest against the general commercialisation of music in Sweden; this led to street protests and a counter-festival, (), being held during the week of Eurovision 1975.

SR had attempted to negotiate with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and other participating broadcasters to enact a form of cost-sharing to fund the event, however a solution failed to materialise prior to the contest and SR was ultimately faced with funding the contest alone. These discussions, however, did eventually lead to the introduction of a new financing system for and future events, with the running costs of the event being split across all participating countries. However, fears of the potential costs required to host the event should Sweden have won again, coupled with the pressure from left-wing groups, meant that SR ultimately decided not to participate in the 1976 event.

== Participating countries ==


A total of 19 countries participated in the 1975 contesta new record number of participants. This included the first ever appearance of , and entries from and , which last participated in and , respectively. Broadcasters in , which participated for the first time in , and , last seen in the contest in 1972, had also considered participating in the contest, however no entries from these countries were ultimately submitted; Greece had reportedly decided against participating at a late stage, and may have opted to refuse to compete alongside Turkey following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.

Ellen Nikolaysen competed in the contest for a second time, having previously participated for as a member of the Bendik Singers. Additionally, John Farrar, a member of the Shadows, had previously supported the as a backing vocalist.


== Production and format ==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1975 was produced by SR. served as executive producer, served as producer and director, served as production designer and Mats Olsson served as musical director, leading the orchestra. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not send their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the EBU, the event was overseen by Clifford Brown as scrutineer.

Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration. As in 1973 and 1974, artists were able to perform in any language, and not necessarily that of the country their represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

Rehearsals in the contest venue for the competing entries began on 19 March 1975, with each participating act having a 50-minute slot on stage to perform through their entry with the orchestra. The first full rehearsals for all entries were held over two days on 19 and 20 March and conducted without their stage costumes. A second round of rehearsals, this time in full costume, was held for all acts on 21 March, with each country given 20 minutes on stage. This was followed that evening with a general dress rehearsal, including a dummy voting process. Technical rehearsals and a final dress rehearsal were held on the morning of 22 March. During the dress rehearsals some of the artists performed their songs in different languages to that which they would be presented during the live broadcast; specifically, the Yugoslav and Portuguese acts performed their entries in English in the dress rehearsal, and then in Slovene and Portuguese in the final, respectively. The Dutch entrants were given an additional rehearsal shortly before the live transmission; this was requested by Dick Bakker, the composer of the Dutch song. Bakker felt that during the general rehearsals the sound quality was noticeably poorer during their entry, the first to perform each time, and that the sound technicians needed time to fix their equipment, which was generally done during their rehearsal slot.

There was a tight security situation at the venue in the run-up to, and during, the event; the Swedish Security Service () had received intelligence reports that the contest may become a target of the West German far-left militant group the Red Army Faction (RAF). The threat to the contest did not ultimately materialise, however one month after the event the RAF targeted the West German embassy in Stockholm.

=== Voting procedure ===

Following the abandoned attempt at introducing a new voting system at the previous year&#x27;s event, plans for a new system to replace both the system used between 1971 and 1973 and that used in 1974 came to fruition in autumn 1974. A sub-group, comprising individuals from Germany&#x27;s ARD, Sweden&#x27;s SR, and Finland&#x27;s YLE, was set-up, and various new voting systems were proposed: ARD suggested that each country should identify its top nine entries and award points ranging between 1 and 10, while YLE proposed a scoring system to award points to eight countries, with the favourite of each country given 14 points, then 10, 7 and 5–1. The Finnish broadcaster also proposed as a compromise awarding to nine countries 10 and 8–1 points. Based on the above ideas, the UK&#x27;s BBC proposed the 12, 10 and 8–1 pattern which was later adopted for this contest, and which had been used in all subsequent editions .

Each country had a jury of eleven members ranging from ages 16 to 60, with a recommendation that there should be a balance between the sexes and that half should be under 25 years old. Each jury member awarded all songs a score between one and five immediately after they had been performed, with no abstentions allowed and without voting for the country they represented. The song which gained the most votes received 12 points, followed by 10 points to the song which got the second highest number of votes, and then between 8 and 1 points for the third- to tenth-placed songs. Ties for any of the positions would be decided by a show of hands. The order of presenting the points by each country&#x27;s spokesperson was done in performance order; it would not be until that the points would be awarded in ascending order, starting at 1 point and finishing with 12 points.

== Contest overview ==
The contest was held on 22 March 1975, beginning at 21:00 (CET) and lasting 2 hours and 12 minutes. The contest was presented by the Swedish television presenter, producer and director Karin Falck. Following the confirmation of the 19 participating countries, a draw was held in Geneva on 24 January 1975 to determine the running order (R/O) of the contest.

The contest was opened by a film montage portraying various cultural stereotypes of Sweden and the Swedish people. Each entry was preceded by a video postcard, which served as an introduction to that country&#x27;s entry and to create a transition between entries to allow stage crew to make changes on stage; the postcards showed each country&#x27;s entrant backstage painting a portrait of themselves and the flag of their nation onto a blank canvas. The interval act was entitled &quot;The World of John Bauer&quot; (), comprising a montage of examples of the Swedish illustrator&#x27;s work, particularly from his anthology &quot;Among Gnomes and Trolls&quot;, set to music from the orchestra. The medallions awarded to the winning songwriters were presented by the Secretary-General of the European Broadcasting Union .

The winner was the represented by the song &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot;, composed by Bakker, written by and Eddy Ouwens, and performed by Teach-In. It was the Netherlands&#x27; fourth contest win, following victories in , and ; the Netherlands thus joined and as the countries with the most contest wins at that point. It was additionally the first time that the song which was performed first had gone on to win the contest. The UK came second for a record-extending ninth time, and Malta, which had come last in its two previous contest appearances, achieved their best result to date with a twelfth-place finish. Turkey, meanwhile, finished in last place on its debut appearance.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1975 contest are listed below.

* José María Íñigo
* Sven Lindahl
* Ray Moore

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in performance order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below, with voting countries listed in the order in which they presented their votes.

=== 12 points ===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. The Netherlands received the maximum score of 12 points from six of the voting countries, with the UK receiving four sets of 12 points, Finland and France each receiving two sets of maximum scores, and Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland receiving one maximum score each.

== Broadcasts ==

Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

In addition to the participating nations, the contest was also reportedly aired, live or deferred, by broadcasters in Eastern European countries via Intervision, and in Australia, Denmark, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, Japan, Jordan, Morocco and South Korea. The contest was reported to have had a possible maximum audience of over 700 million people.

A planned broadcast in Chile by its public broadcaster was prevented by SR, following pressure from the Swedish Musicians&#x27; Union in opposition to the Chilean military dictatorship. Rolf Rembe, spokesman for the union, said that broadcasting the festival to Chile &quot;would give the impression that relations between Chile and world artists are normal&quot;.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<doc id="193442" wikidata="Q209751" url="?curid=193442" title="Eurovision Song Contest 1976">
<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1976 was the 21st edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in The Hague, Netherlands, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; by Teach-In. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (NOS), the contest was held at the Nederlands Congrescentrum on 3 April 1976 and was hosted by 1957 Dutch Eurovision winner Corry Brokken.

Eighteen countries took part in the contest with , and opting not to return to the contest after participating the previous year. Malta would not return to the contest again until 1991. On the other hand, and returned to the competition, having been absent since 1972 and 1974 respectively.

The won the contest this year with the song &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; by Brotherhood of Man. The song went on to become the biggest selling winning single in the history of the contest and won with 80.39% of the possible maximum score and an average of 9.65 of 12; a record under the voting system introduced in 1975.

== Location ==

The Hague is the seat of government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the capital city of the province of South Holland. It is also the third-largest city in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Located in the west of the Netherlands, The Hague is in the centre of the Haaglanden conurbation and lies at the southwest corner of the larger Randstad conurbation. The contest took place at the (presently known as the &quot;World Forum&quot;). The venue was constructed in 1969.

== Participating countries ==

Sweden, Malta and, Turkey all decided not to participate this year, while Austria and Greece returned to the contest, making for eighteen participating countries.

After many controversies related to the previous year&#x27;s contest, the Swedish broadcaster, Sveriges Radio (SR), decided not to participate, as they did not have enough money to host another contest if they won again. SR&#x27;s withdrawal forced the introduction of a new rule in which from 1977 onwards, registration and maintenance fees would be introduced for each of the participating broadcasters, which was meant for financing future contests. These demands forced the Maltese broadcaster to withdraw, as it had a very small budget for 1976. 

As the author and historian John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor notes in his book &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History&quot;, &quot;there had been public demonstrations in Sweden against the contest, which also played a part in SR&#x27;s decision not to take part&quot;.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed as lead artists representing the same country in past editions: Fredi had represented ; Anneli Koivisto as part of &quot;The Friends&quot; had represented as part of ; Peter, Sue and Marc had represented ; Sandra Reemer had represented the along Andres Holten; and Anne-Karine Strøm had represented as part of the Bendik Singers and .

== Format ==
Following the confirmation of the eighteen competing countries, the draw to determine the running order of the contest was held on 8 January 1976.

As with the Dutch hosted contest of 1970, each song was introduced by a pre-recorded film of the performing artist on location in their home nation. Unlike the 1970 films, the Dutch broadcaster made all of the films themselves, sending a crew to each nation to capture the footage. Both the artists from Monaco and Luxembourg were filmed in their respective nations, despite again not being from the country they were representing. Each film was preceded by an animated insert featuring the flags of the eighteen participating nations and ended with a profile shot of the artists.

The interval act was The Dutch Swing College Band led by Peter Schilperoort, who performed live on the stage, intercut with brief interviews with the artists from France, Israel, Austria, Belgium and Spain backstage in the green room conducted by Hans van Willigenburg. Willigenburg asked each of the five artists which song they thought would win, but only French singer Catherine Ferry was willing to give a definite answer; correctly predicting the United Kingdom.

The scoring system introduced in the previous year&#x27;s competition returned in 1976. Each jury voted internally and awarded 12 points to the highest scoring song, 10 to the second highest, then 8 to the third, and then 7 to 1 (from fourth to tenth best song, according to the jury). Unlike today, the points were not given in order (from 1 up to 12), but in the order the songs were performed. The current procedure was not established until 1980 (also held in The Hague).

== Contest overview ==

The following tables reflect the officially verified scores given by each jury, adjusted after the transmission. During the live broadcast, France failed to announce the 4 points they awarded to Yugoslavia, an error overlooked by the scrutineer, Clifford Brown. Thus in the live show, Norway were placed 17th and Yugoslavia 18th. After the broadcast, the scores were adjusted and the two nations swapped places, with Yugoslavia&#x27;s score being adjusted from 6 to 10 points, moving Norway down to last place.

In terms of points gained as a percentage of maximum available, the winning UK entry from Brotherhood of Man is statistically the most successful winning Eurovision entry since the introduction of the &#x27;douze points&#x27; scoring system inaugurated in 1975.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1976 contest are listed below.

* Jacques Harvey
* José María Íñigo
* Ray Moore

== Detailed voting results ==

=== 12 points ===
Below is a summary of all 12 points in the final:

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

The contest was reportedly broadcast in 33 countries, including the participating countries, EBU member broadcasters in Algeria, Morocco, Iceland, Tunisia, and Turkey; in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union via Intervision; and in Hong Kong, Japan, and Mexico. There were also reportedly 27 television and 17 radio commentator teams present at the contest. At least 25 radio stations from eight countries were reported to have broadcast the contest. There was an estimated global audience of 450 to 500 million television viewers and 80 million listeners.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<doc id="193444" wikidata="Q1679958" url="?curid=193444" title="James Anthony Froude">
<text>James Anthony Froude ( ; 23 April 1818 – 20 October 1894) was an English historian, novelist, biographer, and editor of &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. From his upbringing amidst the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement, Froude intended to become a clergyman, but doubts about the doctrines of the Anglican church, published in his scandalous 1849 novel &quot;The Nemesis of Faith&quot;, drove him to abandon his religious career. Froude turned to writing history, becoming one of the best-known historians of his time for his &quot;History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada&quot;.

Inspired by Thomas Carlyle, Froude&#x27;s historical writings were often fiercely polemical, earning him a number of outspoken opponents. Froude continued to be controversial up until his death for his &quot;Life of Carlyle&quot;, which he published along with personal writings of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle. These publications led to persistent gossip and discussion of the couple&#x27;s marital problems.

==Life and works==

===Early life and education (1818–1842)===
He was the son of Robert Hurrell Froude, archdeacon of Totnes, and his wife Margaret Spedding (died 1821). James Anthony was born at Dartington, Devon, on 23 April 1818. He was the youngest of eight children, including engineer and naval architect William Froude and Anglo-Catholic polemicist Richard Hurrell Froude, who was fifteen years his elder. By James&#x27;s third year his mother and five of his siblings had died of consumption, leaving James to what biographer Herbert Paul describes as a &quot;loveless, cheerless boyhood&quot; with his cold, disciplinarian father and brother Richard. He studied at Westminster School from the age of 11 until he was 15; there he was &quot;persistently bullied and tormented&quot;. Despite his unhappiness and his failure in formal education, Froude cherished the classics and read widely in history and theology.

Beginning in 1836, he was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, then the centre of the ecclesiastical revival now called the Oxford Movement. Here Froude began to improve personally and intellectually, motivated to succeed by a brief engagement in 1839 (although this was broken off by the woman&#x27;s father). He obtained a second-class degree in 1840 and travelled to Delgany, Ireland, as a private tutor. He returned to Oxford in 1842, won the Chancellor&#x27;s English essay prize for an essay on political economy, and was elected a fellow of Exeter College.

===Religious development and apostasy (1842–1849)===

Froude&#x27;s brother Richard Hurrell had been one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement, a group which advocated a Catholic rather than a Protestant interpretation of the Anglican Church. Froude grew up hearing the conversation and ideas of his brother with friends John Henry Newman and John Keble, although his own reading provided him with some critical distance from the movement.

During his time at Oxford and in Ireland, Froude became increasingly dissatisfied with the Movement. Froude&#x27;s experience living with an Evangelical clergyman in Ireland conflicted with the Movement&#x27;s characterisation of Protestantism, and his observations of Catholic poverty repulsed him. He increasingly turned to the unorthodox religious views of writers such as Spinoza, David Friedrich Strauss, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Goethe, and especially Thomas Carlyle.

Froude retained a favourable impression of Newman, however, defending him in the controversy over Tract 90 and later in his essay &quot;The Oxford Counter-Reformation&quot; (1881). Froude agreed to contribute to Newman&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the English Saints&quot;, choosing Saint Neot as his subject. However, he found himself unable to credit the accounts of Neot or any other saint, ultimately considering them mythical rather than historical, a discovery which further shook his religious faith.

Nevertheless, Froude was ordained deacon in 1845, initially intending to help reform the church from within. However, he soon found his situation untenable; although he never lost his faith in God or Christianity, he could no longer submit to the doctrines of the Church. He began publicly airing his religious doubts through his semi-autobiographical works &quot;Shadows of the Clouds&quot;, published in 1847 under the pseudonym &quot;Zeta&quot;, and &quot;The Nemesis of Faith&quot;, published under his own name in 1849. &quot;The Nemesis of Faith&quot; in particular raised a storm of controversy, being publicly burned in Oxford, at Exeter College, by William Sewell, and deemed &quot;a manual of infidelity&quot; by the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;. Froude was forced to resign his fellowship, and officials at University College London withdrew the offer of a mastership at Hobart Town, Australia, where Froude had hoped to work while reconsidering his situation. Froude took refuge from the popular outcry by residing with his friend Charles Kingsley at Ilfracombe.

His plight won him the sympathy of kindred spirits, such as George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, and later Mrs Humphry Ward. Ward&#x27;s popular 1888 novel &quot;Robert Elsmere&quot; was largely inspired by this era of Froude&#x27;s life.

===&quot;History of England&quot; (1850–1870)===
At Ilfracombe, Froude met and soon married Charlotte Grenfell, Kingsley&#x27;s sister-in-law, the daughter of Pascoe Grenfell. The couple moved first to Manchester and then to North Wales in 1850, where Froude lived happily, supported by his friends Arthur Hugh Clough and Matthew Arnold. Prevented from pursuing a political career because of legal restrictions on deacons (a position which was at the time legally indelible), he decided to pursue a literary career. He began by writing reviews and historical essays, with only sporadic publications on religious topics, for &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;. Froude soon returned to England, living at London and Devonshire, in order to research his &quot;History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada&quot;, on which he worked for the next twenty years. He worked extensively with original manuscript authorities at the Record Office, Hatfield House, and the village of Simancas, Spain.

Froude&#x27;s historical writing was characterised by its dramatic rather than scientific treatment of history, an approach Froude shared with Carlyle, and also by Froude&#x27;s intention to defend the English Reformation (which he asserted was &quot;the hinge on which all modern history turned&quot;; quotes in and the &quot;salvation of England&quot;) against the interpretations of Catholic historians. Froude focused on figures such as Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, although he became increasingly unfavourable to Elizabeth over the course of his research. Furthermore, he directly expressed both his antipathy towards Rome and his belief that the Church should be subordinated to the state. As a result, when the first volumes of Froude&#x27;s history were published in 1856 they drew the ire of liberals (who felt that Froude&#x27;s depiction of Henry VIII celebrated despotism) and Oxford High Churchmen (who opposed his position on the Church); this hostility was expressed in reviews from the &quot;Christian Remembrancer&quot; and the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;. The work was a popular success, however, and along with Froude&#x27;s 1858 repudiation of his early novels helped him regain much of the esteem he had lost in 1849. Following the death of Thomas Macaulay in 1859, Froude became the most famous living historian in England.

In 1862, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Beginning in 1864, Edward Augustus Freeman, a High Churchman, launched a critical campaign against Froude in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; and later in the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot;, somewhat damaging Froude&#x27;s scholarly reputation. In 1879, Freeman&#x27;s review in the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; of Froude&#x27;s &quot;Short Study of Thomas Becket&quot; incited Froude to respond with a refutation in &quot;The Nineteenth Century&quot; which largely discredited Freeman&#x27;s attacks and reaffirmed the value of Froude&#x27;s manuscript research.

In 1860, Froude&#x27;s wife Charlotte died; in 1861, he married her close friend Henrietta Warre, daughter of John Warre, MP for Taunton. Also in 1861, Froude became editor of &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; following the death of former editor John Parker, who was also Froude&#x27;s publisher. Froude retained this editorship for fourteen years, resigning it in 1874 at the request of Thomas Carlyle, with whom he was working. In 1869 Froude was elected Lord Rector of St. Andrews, defeating Benjamin Disraeli by a majority of fourteen. In 1870, following the passage of the Clerical Disabilities Act (c. 91, Vict. XXXIII &amp; XXXIV; &quot;Bouverie&#x27;s Act&quot;), which permitted priests and deacons to resign from Holy Orders, Froude was finally able to officially rejoin the laity.

In a prize-winning work published in 1981, the historian J. W. Burrow remarked of Froude that he was a leading promoter of the imperialist excitement of the closing years of the century, but that in the mass of his work even empire took second place to religion.

===Looking abroad (1870–1880)===

Soon after the completion of the &quot;History of England&quot; in 1870, Froude began research for a history of Ireland. As with his earlier work, &quot;English in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century&quot; was opinionated, favouring Protestantism over Catholicism and frequently attempting to justify British rule in Ireland, particularly under Oliver Cromwell (a deeply unpopular figure among Irish Catholics). Froude argued that Ireland&#x27;s issues were the result of too little control from authorities in London, and that an even greater amount of British control—an &quot;enlightened despotism&quot;—was needed to alleviate problems that were present in Ireland.

In September 1872, Froude accepted an invitation to lecture in the United States, where his work was also well-known. At that time, many Americans (particularly Irish Americans) were opposed to British rule in Ireland, and Froude hoped to change their views. The lectures, widely discussed, raised the expected controversy, with opposition led by the Dominican friar Thomas Nicholas Burke. Opposition caused Froude to cut his trip short, and he returned to England disappointed both by his impression of America and by the results of his lectures.

In England, too, Froude&#x27;s Irish history had its critics, most notably William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his &quot;History of England in the Eighteenth Century&quot;, the first volumes of which were published in 1878, and in reviews in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

In February 1874, shortly before completion of &quot;English in Ireland&quot;, Froude&#x27;s wife Henrietta died, after which Froude moved from London to Wales. As a means of diversion, Froude travelled to the Southern African Colony of Natal, unofficially for Colonial Secretary Lord Carnarvon, to report on the best means of promoting a confederation of the colonies and states of southern Africa. This region, seen as vital for the security of the Empire, was only partially under British control. Confederating the various states under British rule was seen as the best way of peacefully establishing total imperial control and ending the autonomy of the remaining independent states.

On his second trip to Southern Africa in 1875, Froude was an imperial emissary charged with promoting confederation, a position which conflicted at times with his habit of lecturing on his personal political opinions. In the Cape Colony, his public statements advocating the use of forced labour on the indigenous Xhosa people were particularly controversial given that the Cape Colony was under the rule of the relatively inclusive Molteno-Merriman Government, whose stated policy to treat its Xhosa citizens as &quot;fellow subjects with white men&quot; Froude accused of being &quot;rabid in its anti-Imperialist stance&quot;. Relations were not improved by Froude&#x27;s disdain for the Cape&#x27;s local politics and of the &quot;Cape politicians [who] strut about with their Constitution as a schoolboy newly promoted to a tail coat, and ... imagine that they have the privileges of perfect independence, while we are to defend their coasts and keep troops to protect them in case of Kaffir insurrection.&quot; Overall, though, the confederation scheme as promoted by Carnavon was not popular in the Southern African states, which were still simmering from the last bout of British imperial expansion (President Brand of the Orange Free State refused outright to even consider it).

However, in his travels through different parts of southern Africa, Froude gained some support through publicly agitating for pet local causes. &quot;Chameleon-like, his politics assumed the colour of his surroundings,&quot; was how the &quot;Cape Argus&quot; newspaper described his strategy.&#x27;
The Cape Colony was by far the largest and most powerful state in the region, and Froude thus sought audience with its prime minister, John Molteno, to convey Carnarvon&#x27;s request that he lead the region&#x27;s states into Carnarvon&#x27;s confederation scheme. However, Molteno rebuffed Froude, telling him that the confederation attempt was premature, that the country was &quot;not ripe for it&quot; and that his government would not support it in the politically volatile region. He made the additional point that any federation with the illiberal Boer republics would endanger the rights and franchise of the Cape&#x27;s black citizens, and that overall &quot;the proposals for confederation should emanate from the communities to be affected, and not be pressed upon them from outside.&quot;

Froude responded by openly allying with a radical white opposition party, the &quot;Eastern Cape Separatists,&quot; promising a baronetcy to its leader Paterson if he would overthrow the Cape&#x27;s elected government. In a public speech on 25 July 1876, challenging the Cape Government, he declared, &quot;We want you to manage your natives as they do in Canada and Australia.&quot; He also promised to create a separate white Eastern Cape, and to impose a forced labour system onto the Cape&#x27;s African population along &quot;Transvaal lines&quot; while confiscating Xhosa and Basotho land for redistribution to white farmers. Molteno, furious, condemned Froude&#x27;s statements, accused Froude of imperial interference in the Cape Colony&#x27;s democracy, and told the Colonial Office that he was prepared to sacrifice his job to keep the Cape out of such a confederation. Meanwhile, Merriman wrote to London accusing the &quot;Imperial Agent&quot; of desiring to subject and exterminate the Cape&#x27;s Xhosa citizens. The Ministers of the Cape Parliament went on to accuse Carnarvon of attempting to use the Cape to oppress the region and bring upon a war with the neighbouring Xhosa and Boer states. After Merriman confronted Froude in person, at an Uitenhage event which degenerated into fist fights, Froude gave no further public speeches.

Froude&#x27;s mission was thus ultimately considered unsuccessful, and caused considerable uproar in southern Africa. Nonetheless, Lord Carnarvon pushed ahead with his Confederation plan, which predictably failed and led to the confederation wars.

On his return to London, Froude announced, If anybody had told me two years ago that I should be leading an agitation within Cape Colony, I should have thought my informant delirious. The (Cape) Ministers have the appearance of victory, but we have the substance. Froude&#x27;s observations on Africa were presented in a Report to the Secretary of State and a series of lectures for the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, both of which were adapted into essays for inclusion in Froude&#x27;s essay collection &quot;Short Studies on Great Subjects&quot;.

In 1876 he was appointed to two Royal Commissions, the first into the &quot;Laws and Regulations relating to Home, Colonial, and International Copyright&quot; and the second &quot;into various matters connected with the Universities of Scotland.&quot;

===&quot;Life of Carlyle&quot; controversy (1881–1903)===

Froude had been a close personal friend as well as an intellectual disciple of Thomas Carlyle since 1861, and the two became even closer after the death of Carlyle&#x27;s wife Jane on 21 April 1866. Reading Jane&#x27;s diaries and letters, Carlyle was struck by her unhappiness and his own irritability and inconsideration for her, and he decided to atone by writing her a memorial. In 1871, Carlyle gave Froude this memorial along with a bundle of Jane&#x27;s personal papers, to be published after Carlyle&#x27;s death, if Froude so decided. Also, Carlyle appointed Froude one of his own literary executors, although he was (perhaps intentionally) ambiguous in his instructions.

Shortly after Carlyle&#x27;s death in 1881, Froude published Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Reminiscences of Jane Welsh Carlyle&quot;. Carlyle&#x27;s niece, Mrs. Alexander Carlyle, presented a note written by Carlyle in 1866 stating that the volume should not be published. On the basis of this note, she accused Froude of misconduct in publishing the volume, even though the fact that Carlyle had given the volume to Froude five years later suggested that he had changed his mind. Mrs. A. Carlyle also made claims of ownership over her uncle&#x27;s papers, and over the profits from their publication.

The conflict discouraged Froude from continuing his biography of Carlyle, as he wrote in 1881, &quot;So much ill will has been shown me in the case of the other letters that I walk as if on hot ashes, and often curse the day when I undertook the business.&quot; (quoted in ) However, he was implored by Carlyle&#x27;s brother James and sister Mrs. Austin to continue the work, and in 1882, published the first two volumes. Froude wrote his &quot;Life of Carlyle&quot; according to what he understood as Carlyle&#x27;s own biographical principles, describing not only Carlyle&#x27;s intellectual greatness but also his personal failings. Many readers, however, focused upon the latter, particularly Carlyle&#x27;s unhappy relationship with his wife which soon became a widely used illustration in discussions of the sexual politics of marriage. Controversy was heightened by Froude&#x27;s publication in 1883 of the &quot;Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle&quot;, Jane&#x27;s own writings, and the completion of the &quot;Life of Carlyle&quot; in 1884. Among the strongest critics of Froude&#x27;s biographical work was novelist Margaret Oliphant, who wrote in the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; of 1883 that biography ought to be the &quot;art of moral portrait painting&quot; and described the publication of Jane Carlyle&#x27;s papers as the &quot;betrayal and exposure of the secret of a woman’s weakness.&quot; (quoted in ) After Froude finished his work, ownership of the manuscript material was passed to Mrs. Alexander Carlyle, who quickly authorised alternative biographical volumes by Charles Eliot Norton that excised the offensive material.

The controversy persisted for so long that in 1903, nearly ten years after Froude&#x27;s death, his daughters decided to publish &quot;My Relations with Carlyle&quot;, which their father had written in 1887; in this pamphlet Froude attempted to justify his decisions as biographer, yet went further than his official biography had by speculating, based on &quot;gossip and rumor&quot; circulated by Geraldine Jewsbury, that Carlyle&#x27;s marriage was unconsummated due to impotence. This was disputed by James Crichton-Browne, who published &quot;Froude and Carlyle: The Imputation Considered Medically&quot; (1903) in &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot;, which gave Jewsbury&#x27;s unreliability, Jane&#x27;s unfitness to bear children, and the virility of Carlyle&#x27;s writings as arguments against Froude. Crichton-Browne later corroborated that after one of Jane&#x27;s illnesses, her personal doctor Richard Quain sent word to Carlyle that he could &quot;resume marital relations with his wife.&quot; Aileen Christianson, citing the correspondence of both Carlyles, states: &quot;It seems probable that they did have a sexual relationship, however curtailed in later marriage by illness and inclination, and that the later controversies over Thomas&#x27;s &#x27;impotence&#x27; or Jane&#x27;s &#x27;frigidity&#x27; were more to do with the posturing of the defenders of each side in the marriage than with the truth.&quot;

===&quot;Froudacity&quot;===
Following completion of the &quot;Life of Carlyle&quot;, Froude turned to travel, particularly to the British colonies, visiting South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the West Indies. From these travels he produced two books, &quot;Oceana, or, England and Her Colonies&quot; (1886) and &quot;The English in the West Indies, or The Bow of Ulysses&quot; (1888), which mixed personal anecdotes with Froude&#x27;s thoughts on the British Empire. Froude intended with these writings &quot;to kindle in the public mind at home that imaginative enthusiasm for the Colonial idea of which his own heart was full&quot;. However, these books caused great controversy, stimulating rebuttals and the coining of the term &quot;Froudacity&quot; by Afro-Trinidadian intellectual John Jacob Thomas, who used it as the title of, &quot;Froudacity. West Indian fables by J. A. Froude explained by J. J. Thomas&quot;, his book-length critique of &quot;The English in the West Indies&quot;.

===Later life (1885–1894)===
During this time Froude also wrote a historical novel, &quot;The Two Chiefs of Dunboy&quot;, which was the least popular of his mature works. As with his earlier book on Irish history, Froude used the book to turn an Irish hero into a villain with historical distortion. On the death of his adversary Edward Augustus Freeman in 1892, Froude was appointed, on the recommendation of Lord Salisbury, to succeed him as Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford. The choice was controversial, for Froude&#x27;s predecessors had been among his harshest critics, and his works were generally considered literary works rather than books of serious history suited for academia. Nevertheless, his lectures were very popular, largely because of the depth and variety of Froude&#x27;s experience and he soon became a Fellow of Oriel. Froude lectured mainly on the English Reformation, &quot;English Sea-Men in the Sixteenth Century&quot;, and Erasmus.

The demanding lecture schedule was too much for the ageing Froude. In 1894 he retired to Woodcot in Kingsbridge, Devonshire. He died on 20 October 1894 and is buried in Salcombe Cemetery.

==Family==
Froude was married twice: first in 1849 to Charlotte Maria Grenfell (d.1860), and upon her death, in 1861 to Henrietta Elizabeth Wade (d.1874). He was survived by one daughter (Margaret) of his first wife Charlotte Maria, née Grenfell, and by a son (Ashley Anthony Froude, C.M.G.) and a daughter (May) of his second wife Henrietta Elizabeth, née Warre.

Ashley Anthony Froude was born in 1863 at Paddington, London, England. He married Ethel Aubrey Hallifax, daughter of Albert Praed Hallifax and Isabella Aubrey Coker, in 1897 at Chelsea, London, England. He died on 17 April 1949. He was appointed Companion, Order of St. Michael and St. George (C.M.G.) and held the office of Justice of the Peace (J.P.). His son, John Aubrey Froude (b. 1898, d. 22 September 1914), died when H.M.S. Cressy on which he was serving was torpedoed by U.9.

<text>James Gairdner (22 March 1828 – 4 November 1912) was a British historian. He specialised in 15th-century and early Tudor history, and among other tasks edited the &quot;Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII&quot; series.

Son of John Gairdner, M.D. and brother of Sir William Tennant Gairdner, he was born and educated in Edinburgh. He entered the Public Record Office in London in 1846, remaining at work there until his retirement over fifty years later in 1900. Gairdner&#x27;s contributions to English history related chiefly to the reigns of Richard III, Henry VII and Henry VIII. For the Rolls Series he edited &quot;Letters and Papers illustrative of the Reigns of Richard III and Henry VII&quot; (London, 1861–1863), and &quot;Memorials of Henry VII&quot; (London, 1858). In association with J. S. Brewer, Gairdner prepared the first four volumes (in nine parts) of the &quot;Calendar of Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII&quot;, and, after Brewer&#x27;s death in 1879, Gairdner completed the series, with the assistance of R. H. Brodie, in 1910, in twenty-one volumes (in thirty-three parts), having calendared about a hundred thousand documents, from numerous sources, in several languages.

He published an edition of the &quot;Paston Letters&quot; (London, 1872–1875, and again 1896); and he edited the &quot;Historical collections of a Citizen of London&quot; (London, 1876), and &quot;Three 15th-century Chronicles&quot; (London, 1880) for the Camden Society. His other works included biographies of Richard III (London, 1878) and Henry VII (London, 1889, and subsequently); &quot;The Houses of Lancaster and York&quot; (London, 1874, and other editions); &quot;The English Church in the 16th century&quot; (London, 1902); and &quot;Lollardy and the Reformation in England&quot; (1908). He contributed some seventy-seven fifteenth- and sixteenth-century biographies to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, as well as articles for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the &quot;Cambridge Modern History&quot;, and the &quot;English Historical Review&quot;.

He also wrote &quot;The Life and Reign of Richard the Third&quot;, which argued that the negative portrayal by Shakespeare and More was basically correct. It was re-published with &quot;The Story of Perkin Warbeck&quot; appended in 1898.

Gairdner received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1897, and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1900 Birthday Honours.

<text>John Sherren Brewer, Jr. (March 1809 – February 1879) was an English clergyman, historian and scholar. He was a brother of E. Cobham Brewer, compiler of &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable&quot;.

== Birth and education ==
Brewer was born in Norwich, the son of a Baptist schoolmaster. He matriculated at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1827, graduating B.A. in 1833, M.A. 1835. He was ordained in the Church of England in 1837, and became chaplain to a central London workhouse. In 1839 he was appointed lecturer in classical literature at King&#x27;s College London, and in 1858 he became professor of English language and literature and lecturer in modern history, succeeding FD Maurice. In 1854, Maurice invited him to teach at the newly opened Working Men&#x27;s College; from 1869 to 1872 he was the College&#x27;s Vice Principal.

Brewer&#x27;s son Henry William Brewer (1836-1903) was a noted architectural artist. Henry William Brewer&#x27;s sons were the artist Henry Charles Brewer and the creator of etchings James Alphege Brewer.

== Journalism and history ==
From 1854 onwards, Brewer combined these duties with journalistic work on the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;Morning Post&quot; and &quot;Standard&quot;. In 1856 he was commissioned by the Master of the Rolls to prepare a calendar of the state papers of King Henry VIII, work demanding a vast amount of research. He was also made Reader, and subsequently Preacher, at the Rolls Chapel. He edited &quot;Fr. Rogeri Bacon Opera Quædam Hactenus Inedita&quot; (the edited Works of Roger Bacon) in 1859. In 1877 Benjamin Disraeli obtained for him the crown living of Toppesfield, Essex. There Brewer had time to continue his task of preparing his &quot;Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII&quot;, the &quot;Introductions&quot; to which (published separately, under the title &quot;The Reign of Henry VIII&quot;, in 1884) form a scholarly and authoritative history of Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. New editions of several standard historical works were also produced under Brewer&#x27;s direction.

<text>The Manchester Ship Canal is a inland waterway in the North West of England linking Manchester to the Irish Sea. Starting at the Mersey Estuary at Eastham, near Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, it generally follows the original routes of the rivers Mersey and Irwell through the historic counties of Cheshire and Lancashire. Several sets of locks lift vessels about to the canal&#x27;s terminus in Manchester. Landmarks along its route include the Barton Swing Aqueduct, the world&#x27;s only swing aqueduct, and Trafford Park, the world&#x27;s first planned industrial estate and one of the largest in Europe.

The rivers Mersey and Irwell were first made navigable in the early 18th century. Goods were also transported on the Runcorn extension of the Bridgewater Canal (from 1776) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (from 1830) but by the late 19th century the Mersey and Irwell Navigation had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable. Manchester&#x27;s business community viewed the charges imposed by Liverpool&#x27;s docks and the railway companies as excessive. A ship canal was proposed to give ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester. The region was suffering from the Long Depression; the canal&#x27;s proponents argued that the scheme would boost competition and create jobs. They gained public support for the scheme, which was first presented to Parliament as a bill in 1882. Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool, the canal&#x27;s supporters were unable to gain the necessary act of Parliament to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885.

Construction took six years, beginning in 1887, and cost just over £15 million (). When the ship canal opened in January 1894 (12 years after the first meeting of the Manchester Ship Canal company) it was the largest river navigation canal in the world and enabled the new Port of Manchester to become Britain&#x27;s third-busiest port despite being about inland. Changes to shipping methods and the growth of containerisation during the 1970s and 80s meant that many ships were too big to use the canal and traffic declined, resulting in the closure of the terminal docks at Salford. Although able to accommodate vessels from coastal ships to intercontinental cargo liners, the canal was not large enough for most modern vessels. By 2011 traffic had decreased from its peak in 1958 of of freight each year to about . The canal is now privately owned by Peel Holdings, whose plans include redevelopment, expansion and an increase in shipping from 8,000 containers a year to 100,000 by 2030 as part of their Atlantic Gateway project.

==History==
The canal was completed just as the Long Depression was coming to an end, but in its early years it was not the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for. At first gross revenue was less than a quarter of expected net revenue, and throughout at least the first nineteen years of the canal it was unable to make a profit or meet the interest payments to the Corporation of Manchester. Many ship owners were reluctant to dispatch ocean-going vessels along a &quot;locked cul-de-sac&quot; at a maximum speed of . The Ship Canal Company, which developed the canal, found it difficult to attract a diversified export trade, which meant that ships frequently had to return down the canal loaded with ballast rather than freight. However traffic gradually developed and the Canal became successful, paying dividends from 1921 onwards. As the import trade in oil began to grow during the 20th century the balance of canal traffic gradually switched towards the west, from Salford to Stanlow.
Unlike most other British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised. 

===Early history===
The idea that the rivers Mersey and Irwell should be made navigable from the Mersey Estuary in the west to Manchester in the east was first proposed in 1660 and revived in 1712 by the English civil engineer Thomas Steers. The necessary legislation was proposed in 1720, and the act of Parliament for the navigation, the Rivers Mercy and Irwell Navigation Act 1720 (7 Geo. 1. St. 1. c. 15), passed into law in 1721. Construction began in 1724, undertaken by the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company. By 1734 boats &quot;of moderate size&quot; were able to make the journey from quays near Water Street in Manchester to the Irish Sea, but the navigation was only suitable for small ships; during periods of low rainfall or when strong easterly winds held back the tide in the estuary, there was not always sufficient depth of water for a fully laden boat. The completion in 1776 of the Runcorn extension of the Bridgewater Canal, followed in 1830 by the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, intensified competition for the carriage of goods.

In 1825 an application had been made to Parliament for an act to allow the construction of a ship canal between the mouth of the River Dee and Manchester at a cost of £1 million, but &quot;the necessary forms not having been observed&quot;, it did not become law. In 1844 ownership of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation was transferred to the Bridgewater Trustees, and in 1872 it was sold to the Bridgewater Navigation Company for £1.112 million. The navigation had by then fallen into disrepair, its owners preferring instead to maintain the more profitable canal; in 1882 the navigation was described as being &quot;hopelessly choked with silt and filth&quot;, and was closed to all but the smaller boats for 264 out of 311 working days.

Along with deteriorating economic conditions in the 1870s and the start of a period known as the Long Depression, the dues charged by the Port of Liverpool and the railway charges from there to Manchester were perceived to be excessive by Manchester&#x27;s business community; it was often cheaper to import goods from Hull, on the opposite side of the country, than it was from Liverpool. A ship canal was proposed as a way to reduce carriage charges, avoid payment of dock and town dues at Liverpool, and bypass the Liverpool to Manchester railways by giving Manchester direct access to the sea for its imports and its exports of manufactured goods. Historian Ian Harford suggested that the canal may also have been conceived as an &quot;imaginative response to [the] problems of depression and unemployment&quot; that Manchester was experiencing during the early 1880s. Its proponents argued that reduced transport costs would make local industry more competitive and that the scheme would help create new jobs.

The idea was championed by Manchester manufacturer Daniel Adamson, who arranged a meeting at his home, The Towers in Didsbury, on 27 June 1882. He invited the representatives of several Lancashire towns, local businessmen and politicians, and two civil engineers: Hamilton Fulton and Edward Leader Williams. Fulton&#x27;s design was for a tidal canal, with no locks and a deepened channel into Manchester. With the city about above sea level, the docks and quays would have been well below the surrounding surface. Williams&#x27; plan was to dredge a channel between a set of retaining walls, and build a series of locks and sluices to lift incoming vessels up to Manchester. Both engineers were invited to submit their proposals, and Williams&#x27; plans were selected to form the basis of a bill to be submitted to Parliament later that year.

===Public campaign===
To generate support for the scheme, the provisional committee initiated a public campaign led by Joseph Lawrence, who had worked for the Hull and Barnsley Railway. His task was to set up committees in every ward in Manchester and throughout Lancashire, to raise subscriptions and sell the idea to the local public. The first meeting was held on 4 October in Manchester&#x27;s Oxford Ward, followed by another on 17 October in the St. James Ward. Within a few weeks meetings had been held throughout Manchester and Salford, culminating in a conference on 3 November attended by the provisional committee and members of the various Ward Committees. A large meeting of the working classes, attended by several local notables including the general secretaries of several trade unions, was held on 13 November at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester.

Regular night-time meetings were held across the region, headed by speakers from a range of professions. Harford suggests that the organisers&#x27; choice of orators represents their &quot;canny ability&quot; to choose speakers who might move their audiences to support their cause. By adopting techniques used by the Anti-Corn Law League, their strategy was ultimately successful: local offices were acquired, secretaries hired and further meetings organised. The weekly &quot;Ship Canal Gazette&quot;, priced at one penny, was by the end of the year being sold at newsagents in towns across Lancashire. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was part of a prolonged print campaign organised by the committee, to circulate leaflets and pamphlets, and write supportive letters to the local press, often signed with pseudonyms. One of the few surviving leaflets, &quot;The Manchester Ship Canal. Reasons why it Should be Made&quot;, argued against dock and railway rates, which were apparently levied &quot;with the object of protecting the interests of Railway kings, [so that] trade is handicapped, and wages kept low&quot;. By the end of 1882 the provisional committee comprised members from several of Manchester&#x27;s large industries, but notably few of the city&#x27;s wealthier inhabitants. The sympathetic &quot;Manchester City News&quot; reported that &quot;the rich men of South and East Lancashire, with a few notable exceptions, have not rivalled the enthusiasm of the general public&quot;.

===Bills===
The Mersey Docks Board opposed the committee&#x27;s first bill, presented late in 1882, and it was rejected by Parliament in January 1883 for breaching Standing Orders. Within six weeks the committee organised hundreds of petitions from a range of bodies across the country: one representing Manchester was signed by almost 200,000 people. The requirement for Standing Orders was dispensed with, and the represented bill allowed to proceed. Some witnesses against the scheme, worried that a canal would cause the entrance to the Mersey estuary to silt up, blocking traffic, cited the case of Chester harbour. This had silted up due to a man-made cut through the Dee estuary. Faced with conflicting evidence, Parliament rejected the bill. Later mass meetings were held, including a large demonstration at Pomona Gardens on 24 June 1884. Strong opposition from Liverpool led the House of Commons Committee to reject the committee&#x27;s second bill on 1 August 1884.
The unresolved question of what would happen to the Mersey estuary if the canal was built had remained a sticking point. During questioning, an engineer for the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board was asked how he would avoid such a problem. His reply, &quot;I should enter at Eastham and carry the canal along the shore until I reached Runcorn, and then I would strike inland&quot;, prompted Williams to change his design to include this suggestion. Despite continued opposition, the committee&#x27;s third bill, presented in November 1884, was passed by Parliament on 2 May 1885, and received royal assent on 6 August, becoming the (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. clxxxviii). Certain conditions were attached; £5 million had to be raised, and the ship canal company was legally obliged to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey &amp; Irwell Navigation within two years. The estimated cost of construction was £5.16 million, and the work was expected to take four years to complete.

===Financing===
The Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885 stipulated that the ship canal company&#x27;s £8 million share capital had to be issued within two years, otherwise the act would lapse. Adamson wanted to encourage the widest possible share ownership and believed the funds should be raised largely from the working population. Richard Peacock, vice-chairman of the Provisional Manchester Ship Canal Committee, said in 1882:


The act of Parliament forbade the company from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for ordinary people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten so they could be paid for in instalments. The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another act of Parliament to allow the company&#x27;s share capital to be restructured as £3 million of ordinary shares and £4 million of preference shares. Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. Barings and Rothschild jointly issued a prospectus for the sale of the preference shares on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully underwritten, allowing construction to begin. The first sod was cut on 11 November 1887, by Lord Egerton of Tatton, who had taken over the chairmanship of the Manchester Ship Canal Company from Adamson.

The canal company exhausted its capital of £8 million in four years when only half the construction work was completed. To avoid bankruptcy they appealed for funds to Manchester Corporation, which set up a Ship Canal Committee. On 9 March 1891, the corporation decided, on the committee&#x27;s recommendation, to lend the necessary £3 million, to preserve the city&#x27;s prestige. In return, the corporation was allowed to appoint five of the fifteen members of the board of directors. The company subsequently raised its estimates of the cost of completion in September 1891 and again in June 1892. An executive committee was appointed as an emergency measure in December 1891, and on 14 October 1892 the Ship Canal Committee resolved to lend a further £1.5 million on condition that Manchester Corporation had an absolute majority on the canal company&#x27;s board of directors and its various sub-committees. The corporation subsequently appointed 11 of the 21 seats, nominated Alderman Sir John Harwood as deputy director of the company, and secured majorities on five of the board&#x27;s six sub-committees. The cost to Manchester Corporation of financing the Ship Canal Company had a significant impact on local taxpayers. Manchester&#x27;s municipal debt rose by 67 per cent, resulting in a 26 per cent increase in rates between 1892 and 1895.

However well this arrangement served the corporation, by the mid-1980s it had become &quot;meaningless&quot;. Most of the company&#x27;s shares were controlled by the property developer John Whittaker, and in 1986 the council agreed to give up all but one of its seats in return for a payment of £10 million. The deal extricated Manchester Council from a politically difficult conflict of interest, as Whittaker was proposing to develop a large out of town shopping centre on land owned by the Ship Canal Company at Dumplington, the present-day Trafford Centre. The council opposed the scheme, believing that it would damage the city centre economy, but accepted that it was &quot;obviously in the interests of the shareholders&quot;.
===Construction===
Thomas Walker was appointed as a contractor, with Edward Williams as chief engineer and designer and general manager. The route was divided into eight sections, with one engineer responsible for each. The first reached from Eastham to Ellesmere Port. Mount Manisty, a large mound of earth on a narrow stretch between the canal and the Mersey northwest of Ellesmere Port, was constructed from soil taken from the excavations. It and the adjacent Manisty Cutting were named after the engineer in charge. The last section built was the passage from Weston Point through the Runcorn Gap to Norton; the existing docks at Runcorn and Weston had to be kept operational until they could be connected to the completed western sections of the ship canal.

For the first two years construction went according to plan, but Walker died on 25 November 1889. The work was continued by his executors, but the project suffered setbacks and was hampered by harsh weather and several serious floods. In January 1891, when the project had been expected to have been completed, a severe winter added to the difficulties; the Bridgewater Canal, the company&#x27;s only source of income, was closed after a fall of ice. The company decided to take over the contracting work and bought all the on-site equipment for £400,000. Some railway companies, whose bridges had to be modified to cross the canal, demanded compensation. The London and North Western Railway and Great Western Railway refused to cooperate, and between them, they demanded about £533,000 for the inconvenience. The Ship Canal Company was unable to demolish the older, low railway bridges until August 1893, when the matter went to arbitration. The railway companies were awarded just over £100,000, a fraction of their combined claims.


By the end of 1891, the ship canal was open to shipping as far as Saltport, the name given to wharves built at the entrance to the Weaver Navigation. The success of the new port was a source of consternation to merchants in Liverpool, who suddenly found themselves cut out of the trade-in goods such as timber, and a source of encouragement to shipping companies, who began to realise the advantages an inland port would offer. Saltport was rendered useless when the ship canal was completely filled with water in November 1893. The Manchester Ship Canal Police were formed the following month, and the canal opened to its first traffic on 1 January 1894. On 21 May, Queen Victoria performed the official opening, the last of three royal visits she made to Manchester. During the ceremony she knighted the Mayor of Salford, William Henry Bailey, and the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Anthony Marshall; Edward Leader Williams was knighted on 2 July by letters patent.

The ship canal took six years to complete at a cost of just over £15 million, (). It is still the longest river navigation canal and remains the world&#x27;s eighth-longest ship canal, only slightly shorter than the Panama Canal in Central America. More than 54 million cubic yards (41,000,000 m³) of material were excavated, about half as much as was removed during the building of the Suez Canal. An average of 12,000 workers were employed during construction, peaking at 17,000. Regular navvies were paid d per hour for a 10-hour working day, equivalent to about £16 per day in 2010. In terms of machinery, the project made use of more than of temporary rail track, 180 locomotives, more than 6000 trucks and wagons, 124 steam-powered cranes, 192 other steam engines, and 97 steam excavators. Major engineering landmarks of the scheme included the Barton Swing Aqueduct, the first swing aqueduct in the world, and a neighbouring swing bridge for road traffic at Barton, both of which are now Grade II* listed structures. In 1909 the canal&#x27;s depth was increased by to , equalling that of the Suez Canal.

===Operational history===
The Manchester Ship Canal enabled the newly created Port of Manchester to become Britain&#x27;s third-busiest port, despite the city being about inland. Since its opening in 1894, the canal has handled a wide range of ships and cargos, from coastal vessels to intra-European shipping and intercontinental cargo liners. The first vessel to unload its cargo on the opening day was the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, belonging to the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), which was also the first vessel registered at Manchester; the CWS operated a weekly service to Rouen.

Manchester Liners established regular sailings by large ocean-going vessels. In late 1898 the &quot;Manchester City&quot;, at 7,698 gross register tons, became the largest vessel to reach the terminal docks. Carrying cattle and general cargo, it was met by the Lord Mayor of Manchester and a large welcoming crowd. In 1968 Manchester Liners converted its fleet to container vessels only. To service them it built two dedicated container terminals next to No. 9 Dock. The four container vessels commissioned that year, each of 11,898 gross tons, were the largest ever to make regular use of the terminal docks at Salford. In 1974 the canal handled 2.9 million long tons (3.25 million short tons) of dry cargo, 27 per cent of which was carried by Manchester Liners. The dry tonnage was, and is still, greatly supplemented by crude and refined oil products transported in large tanker ships to and from the Queen Elizabeth II Dock at Eastham and the Stanlow Refinery just east of Ellesmere Port, and also in smaller tankers to Runcorn. The limitations imposed by the canal on the maximum size of container vessel meant that by the mid-1970s Manchester Liners was becoming uncompetitive; the company sold its last ship in 1985. Mersey Ferry operate the river cruise along Manchester Ship Canal.
The amount of freight carried by the canal peaked in 1958 at 18 million long tons (20 million short tons), but the increasing size of ocean-going ships and the port&#x27;s failure to introduce modern freight-handling methods resulted in that headline figure dropping steadily, and the closure of the docks in Salford in 1984. Total freight movements on the ship canal were down to 7.56 million long tons (8.47 million short tons) by 2000, and further reduced to 6.60 million long tons (7.39 million short tons) for the year ending September 2009.

The maximum length of vessel currently accepted is with a beam of and a maximum draft of . By contrast the similarly sized Panama Canal, completed a few years after the Manchester Ship Canal, was able to accept ships of up to in length with a beam of . Since June 2016, the Panama Canal has been able to handle vessels of in length with a beam of and a draft of , and cargo capacity up to . Ships passing under the Runcorn Bridge have a height restriction of above normal water levels.
==Present day==

In 1984 Salford City Council used a derelict land grant to purchase the docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company, rebranding the area as Salford Quays. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal&#x27;s upper reaches had declined to such an extent that its owners considered closing it above Runcorn. In 1993 the Ship Canal Company was acquired by Peel Holdings; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the Port of Liverpool. The company announced a £50 billion Atlantic Gateway plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester Ship Canal as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large distribution centre to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports predict that the number of containers transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.

==Route==

===Geography===
From Eastham, the canal runs parallel to, and along the south side of the Mersey estuary, past Ellesmere Port. Between Rixton east of the M6 motorway&#x27;s Thelwall Viaduct and Irlam, the canal joins the Mersey; thereafter it roughly follows the route the river used to take. At the confluence of the Mersey and Irwell near Irlam, the canal follows the old course of the River Irwell into Manchester.

===Locks, sluices and weirs===
Vessels travelling to and from the terminal docks, which are above sea level, must pass through several locks. Each set has a large lock for ocean-going ships and a smaller, narrower lock for vessels such as tugs and coasters. The entrance locks at Eastham on the Wirral side of the Mersey, which seal off the tidal estuary, are the largest on the canal. The larger lock is long by wide; the smaller lock is by . Four additional sets of locks lie further inland, long and wide and by for the smaller lock; each has a rise of approximately . The locks are at Eastham; Latchford, near Warrington; Irlam; Barton near Eccles and Mode Wheel, Salford.

Five sets of sluices and two weirs are used to control the canal&#x27;s depth. The sluices, located at Mode Wheel Locks, Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are designed to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists of a set of mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.

Woolston Siphon Weir, built in 1994 to replace an earlier structure and located on an extant section of the Mersey near Latchford, controls the amount of water in the Latchford Pond by emptying canal water into the Mersey. Howley Weir controls water levels downstream of Woolston Weir. Further upstream, Woolston Guard Weir enables maintenance to be carried out on both.

===Docks and wharfs===
Seven terminal docks were constructed for the opening of the canal. Four small docks were located on the south side of the canal near Cornbrook, within the Borough of Stretford: Pomona Docks No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The three main docks, built primarily for large ocean-going vessels, were in Salford, to the west of Trafford Road on the north bank of the canal, docks No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8. In 1905, No. 9 Dock was completed on the same site. Dock No. 5, known as Ordsall Dock, was part of Pomona Docks, but was dug on the Salford side of the river; it was never completed and was filled in around 1905.

Pomona Docks have also been filled in except for the still intact No. 3 Dock, and are largely derelict. A lock at No. 3 Dock connects it to the nearby Bridgewater Canal at the point where the two canals run in parallel. The western four docks have been converted into the Salford Quays development; ships using the Manchester Ship Canal now dock at various places along the canal side such as Mode Wheel (Salford), Trafford Park, and Ellesmere Port. Most ships have to terminate at Salford Quays, although vessels capable of passing under Trafford Road swing bridge (permanently closed in 1992) can continue up the River Irwell to Hunts Bank, near Manchester Cathedral.

In 1893 the Ship Canal Company sold a parcel of land just east of the Mode Wheel Locks to the newly established Manchester Dry Docks Company. The graving docks were constructed adjacent to the south bank of the canal, and a floating pontoon dock was built nearby. Each of the three graving docks could accommodate ocean-going ships of up to in length and in beam, equivalent to vessels of 8,000 gross register tons. Manchester Liners acquired control of the company in 1974, to ensure the availability of facilities for the repair of its fleet of ships.

===Trafford Park===
Two years after the opening of the ship canal, financier Ernest Terah Hooley bought the country estate belonging to Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford for £360,000 (£ in 2009). Hooley intended to develop the site, which was close to Manchester and at the end of the canal, as an exclusive housing estate, screened by woods from industrial units constructed along the frontage onto the canal.

With the predicted traffic for the canal slow to materialise, Hooley and Marshall Stevens (the general manager of the Ship Canal Company) came to see the benefits that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to both the ship canal and the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates, where he remained until 1930, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director.

Within five years Trafford Park, Europe&#x27;s largest industrial estate, was home to forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were grain silos; the grain was used for flour and as ballast for ships carrying raw cotton. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the Manchester Blitz in 1940) was Europe&#x27;s largest grain elevator. It had a capacity of 40,000 tons and its automatic conveying and spouting system could distribute grain into 226 bins. The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 it bought the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK&#x27;s largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos.

Inland from the canal the British Westinghouse Electric Company bought 11 per cent of the estate. Westinghouse&#x27;s American architect Charles Heathcote was responsible for much of the planning and design of their factory, which built steam turbines and turbo generators. By 1899 Heathcote had also designed fifteen warehouses for the Manchester Ship Canal Company.

===Manchester Ship Canal Railway===
During construction, a year after the death of Walker, the directors of the canal company and Walker&#x27;s trustees came to an agreement for the canal company to take ownership of the construction assets. These included the more than of temporary rail track, 180 locomotives and more than 6,000 trucks and wagons. These formed the basis of the Manchester Ship Canal Railway, which became the largest private railway in the United Kingdom.

The construction railway followed the route of the former River Irwell. To bring in construction materials, the construction railway had a connection to the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) east of Irlam railway station. Every month this allowed more than 10,000 tons of coal and 8,000 tons of cement to be delivered to sites along the canal excavation. All existing railway companies with lines along the route had been given notice that their lines had to either be abandoned by a given date or raised to give a minimum of clearance with all deviation construction costs to be paid by the MSC. The CLC Glazebrook to Woodley mainline passed over the River Mersey at Cadishead and so they decided to build a deviation. Construction of the Cadishead Viaduct began in 1892, approached via earth banks, with two brick arches accessing a multi-lattice iron girder centre span of in length. It opened to freight on 27 February 1893 and to passenger traffic on 29 May 1893. Following the withdrawal of passenger services in 1964, the line became freight only. When expensive repairs to the viaduct were needed in the early 1980s British Rail opted to close it, together with the line to Glazebrook.

At the end of construction, the canal company left in place the original construction railway route, and eventually developed track along of the canal&#x27;s length, mainly to its north bank. Built and operated mainly as a single-track line, the busiest section from Weaste Junction through Barton and Irlam, to Partington was all double-tracked. The railway&#x27;s access to Trafford Park was over the double-tracked Detroit Swing Bridge, which after closure of the MSC Railway in 1988 was floated down the canal to be placed in Salford Quays. The only major deviation was to allow construction of the CWS Irlam soap works and the adjacent Partington Steel &amp; Iron Co. works at Partington (both of which had their own private railways and locomotives), with the MSC Railway&#x27;s deviation route pushed south to run alongside the canal&#x27;s north bank and under the Irlam viaduct. The canal company also developed large complexes of sidings along the route, built to service freight to and from the canal&#x27;s docks and nearby industrial estates, especially at: Salford Docks; Trafford Park; Partington North Coaling Basin (both sides of the canal); Glazebrook sidings; and a small but busy marshalling yard east of Irlam locks. Unlike most other railway companies in the UK it was not nationalised in 1948, and at its peak it had 790 employees, 75 locomotives, 2,700 wagons and more than of track.

The MSC Railway was able to receive and despatch goods trains to and from all the UK&#x27;s mainline railway systems, using connecting junctions at three points in the terminal docks. Two were to the north of the canal, operated by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the London and North Western Railway. The third was to the south, operated by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), whereby the MSC Railway had taken over the old and abandoned route of the CLC, giving them a monopoly on traffic to the new soap works and steel mill.

The MSC Railway&#x27;s steam locomotives were designed to negotiate the tight curves of the sidings and industrial tracks on which they ran. Originally specifying 0-4-0 wheel arrangements, later 0-6-0 locomotives – purchased to cope with increasing traffic and loads – had flangeless centre axles, whilst the coupling rods had a hinged central section that permitted several inches of lateral play. A long term user of Hudswell Clarke, from their steam through to diesel locomotives, like many industrial railways later motive power was often provided by the purchase of refurbished former &quot;big-four&quot; operated types, with the advantage that crew were readily available to operate them. Post-WWII purchases included several war-surplus Hunslet &#x27;Austerity&#x27; 0-6-0 saddle tanks; the last steam locomotive types purchased for the MSC Railway. A fleet of diesel locomotives was bought between 1959 and 1966, including 18 0-4-0 diesels from the Rolls-Royce-owned Sentinel Waggon Works from 1964 to 1966. These enabled the MSC Railways to complete its conversion from steam on 6 July 1966, more than two years before British Railways.

However, as transshipment costs increased, and unprocessed bulk cargoes decreased in volume, the economics of road transport resulted in a gradual dwindling of traffic on the MSC Railway system, and hence contraction in the MSC Railway itself. Traffic reduction was added to by the 1969 closure of the CWS Irlam soap works; post nationalisation British Steel Corporation building their own line to Glazebrook to junction with BR; and severe reductions in traffic of ICI&#x27;s soda ash trains, British Tar Products and reduced domestic coal consumption. With the remaining engines stationed at Ellesmere Port and Stanlow, maintenance on the line from Irlam through to Partington was halted in late 1977, and all through traffic except engineering trains stopped on 21 December. The through line was officially closed to all traffic in 1978, but many of the sidings complexes remained; the last operational section of the MSC Railway, at Trafford Park, closed on 30 April 2009.

===Other features on the banks===
At Ellesmere Port the canal is joined by the Shropshire Union Canal, at a site now occupied by the National Waterways Museum. The area formerly consisted of a canal port linking the Shropshire Union Canal to the River Mersey. Designed by Thomas Telford, it remained operational until the 1950s. It was a &quot;marvellously self-contained world&quot; with locks, docks, warehouses, a blacksmith&#x27;s forge, stables, and cottages for the workers. Its Island Warehouse was built in 1871 to store grain. A few miles from Ellesmere Port, at Weston Point, near Runcorn, the ship canal also connects with the Weaver Navigation.

==Crossings==

Significant crossings of the Canal include:
* Runcorn Railway Bridge
* Silver Jubilee Bridge
* Mersey Gateway Bridge
* M6 motorway
* Warburton Toll Bridge
* Hulme Bridge Ferry between Irlam and Flixton
* M60 motorway
* Barton Swing Aqueduct and Barton Road Swing Bridge
* Latchford Viaduct which carried the Warrington and Stockport Railway over the canal until 1985. Since then has been closed but the viaduct including the lines remain in situ.

==Ecology==

The quality of water in the ship canal is adversely affected by several factors. The high population density of the Mersey Basin has, historically, placed heavy demands on sewage treatment and disposal. Industrial and agricultural discharges into the Irwell, Medlock, and Irk rivers are responsible for industrial contaminants found in the canal. Matters have improved since 1990 when the National Rivers Authority found the area between Trafford Road Bridge and Mode Wheel Locks to be &quot;grossly polluted&quot;. The water was depleted of dissolved oxygen, which in the latter half of the 20th century often resulted in toxic sediments normally present at the bottom of the turning basin in what is now Salford Quays rising to the surface during the summer months, giving the impression of solid ground. Previously, only roach and sticklebacks could be found in the canal&#x27;s upper levels, and then only during the colder parts of the year, but an oxygenation project implemented at Salford Quays from 2001, together with the gradual reduction of industrial pollutants from the Mersey&#x27;s tributaries, has encouraged the migration into the canal of fish populations from further upstream. The canal&#x27;s water quality remains low, with mercury and cadmium in particular present at &quot;extremely high levels&quot;. Episodic pollution and a lack of habitat remain problems for wildlife, although in 2005, for the first time in living memory, salmon were observed breeding in the River Goyt (a part of the Mersey&#x27;s catchment). In 2010 the Environment Agency issued a report concluding that the canal &quot;does not pose a significant barrier to salmon movement or impact on migratory behaviours&quot;.

Despite the canal&#x27;s poor water quality there are several nature reserves along its banks. Wigg Island, a former brownfield site east of Runcorn, contains a network of public footpaths through newly planted woodlands and meadows. Wildlife includes multiple butterfly and dragonfly species, kestrels, swallows and house martins. Further upstream the Moore Nature Reserve, which is bisected by the de-watered Runcorn to Latchford Canal, comprises lakes, woodland and meadows. The reserve is open to the public and contains a number of bird hides, from which native owls and woodpeckers may be viewed. Near Thelwall, Woolston Eyes (a corruption of the Saxon &quot;Ees&quot;), is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is used as a deposit for canal dredgings and is a habitat for many species of bird, including black-necked grebes, grasshopper warblers, blackcaps and common whitethroats. Great crested newts and adders are present, and local flora includes orchids and broad-leaved helleborines. Diving ducks are regular visitors to Salford Quays, where species such as pochard and tufted ducks feed on winter nights.

<doc id="193450" wikidata="Q2795" url="?curid=193450" title="Chemnitz">
<text>Chemnitz (; from 1953 to 1990: Karl-Marx-Stadt (); ; ) is the third-largest city in the German state of Saxony after Leipzig and Dresden, and the fourth-largest city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden. 

The city lies in the middle of a string of cities sitting in the densely populated northern foreland of the Elster and Ore Mountains, stretching from Plauen in the southwest via Zwickau, Chemnitz and Freiberg to Dresden in the northeast, and is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region. Located in the Ore Mountain Basin, the city is surrounded by the Ore Mountains to the south and the Central Saxon Hill Country to the north. The city stands on the Chemnitz River, which is formed through the confluence of the rivers Zwönitz and Würschnitz in the borough of Altchemnitz.

The name of the city as well as the names of the rivers are of Slavic origin. Chemnitz is the third-largest city in the Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialect area after Leipzig and Dresden. The city&#x27;s economy is based on the service sector and manufacturing industry. Chemnitz University of Technology has around 10,000 students.

Chemnitz is known for its many industrial age buildings and monuments, and is the European Capital of Culture of 2025.

== Toponymy ==
Chemnitz is named after the river Chemnitz, the main tributary of the Zwickau Mulde. The word &quot;Chemnitz&quot; derives from the Slavic expression for &quot;stone&quot; (), which is the root of the Upper Sorbian designations for the river (; &quot;stony [brook]&quot;), as well as for the city itself (also ). The term is composed of the stem , and the Slavic feminine suffix . The city is known in Czech as and in Polish sometimes as .

Chemnitz is one of many places worldwide whose name derives from the Slavic root such as Kamianske and Kamianets-Podilskyi in Ukraine, Kamensk-Uralsky and Kamensk-Shakhtinsky in Russia, Kamenica (Kosovo), Kamienna Góra (Poland), Kamenz (Kamjenc) (Germany), Kamień Pomorski (Poland), Kamieniec Ząbkowicki (Poland), Kamenitsa (Bulgaria), Kamenický Šenov (Czech Republic), Kamieńsk (Poland), Kamenskoye (Russia), and Kamenac (Croatia). Of these, Chemnitz has the largest population.

== History ==

===Beginnings===
The area was sparsely settled by Slavic tribes related to the modern Sorbs. The placename is first attested for the eponymous local river (1012/18: &quot;Caminizi fluvium&quot;). In 1143, a Benedictine monastery at &quot;Kameniz&quot; was founded, around which a settlement grew. Around 1170, the town was granted the rights of a free imperial city by emperor Frederick I.

===Meissen and Saxony===
In 1307, the town became subordinate to the Margraviate of Meissen, the predecessor of the Saxon state. In medieval times, Chemnitz became a centre of textile production and trade. More than one third of the population worked in textile production. In 1356 the Margraviate was succeeded by the Electorate of Saxony.

Geologist Georgius Agricola (1494–1555), author of several significant works on mining and metallurgy including the landmark treatise &quot;De Re Metallica&quot;, became city physician of Chemnitz in 1533 and lived here until his death in 1555. In 1546 he was elected a Burgher of Chemnitz and in the same year also was appointed Burgomaster (lord mayor), serving again in 1547, 1551, and 1553. In spite of having been a leading citizen of the city, when Agricola died in 1555 the Protestant Duke denied him burial in the city&#x27;s cathedral due to Agricola&#x27;s allegiance to his Roman Catholic faith. Agricola&#x27;s friends arranged for his remains to be buried in more sympathetic Zeitz, approximately 50 km away. Chemnitz became a famous trading and textile manufacturing town.

In 1806, with the end of the Holy Roman Empire, the Electorate was renamed as the Kingdom of Saxony, and this survived until the revolutions of 1918 which followed the Armistice ending the First World War.

By the early 19th century, Chemnitz had become an industrial centre (sometimes called &quot;the Saxon Manchester&quot;, , ). Important industrial companies were founded by Richard Hartmann, Louis Schönherr and Johann von Zimmermann. Chemnitz became a centre of innovation in the kingdom of Saxony and later in Germany. In 1913, Chemnitz had a population of 320,000 and, like Leipzig and Dresden, was larger at that time than today. After losing inhabitants due to the First World War Chemnitz grew rapidly again and reached its all-time peak of 360,250 inhabitants in 1930. Thereafter, growth was stalled by the world economic crisis.

===Weimar Republic===

As a working-class industrial city, Chemnitz was a powerful center of socialist political organization after the First World War. At the foundation of the German Communist Party the local Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany voted by 1,000 votes to three to break from the party and join the Communist Party behind their local leaders, Fritz Heckert and Heinrich Brandler. In March 1919 the German Communist Party had over 10,000 members in the city of Chemnitz. Chemnitz was one of the big German industrial centers. Due to the export traffic a modern marshalling yard was erected 1929 in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf. At that time it was a leading city in the European textile market. Auto Union (today Audi) was founded 1932 in Chemnitz.

===World War II===
Allied bombing destroyed 41 per cent of the built-up area of Chemnitz during the Second World War. Chemnitz contained factories that produced military hardware and a Flossenbürg forced labor subcamp (500 female inmates) for Astra-Werke AG. The oil refinery was a target for bombers during the Oil Campaign of World War II, and Operation Thunderclap attacks included the following raids:
* 14/15 February 1945: The first major raid on Chemnitz used 717 RAF bombers, but due to cloud cover most bombs fell over open countryside.
* 2/3–5 March: USAAF bombers attacked the marshalling yards.
* 5 March: 760 RAF bombers attacked.
The city was occupied by Soviet troops on 8 May 1945. 

The headquarters of the auto manufacturer Auto Union was based in Chemnitz from 1932 and its buildings were badly damaged. At the end of the war, the company&#x27;s executives fled and relocated the company in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, where it evolved into Audi, now a brand within the Volkswagen group.

The World War II bombings left most of the city centre in ruins and post-war, the East German reconstruction included large low-rise (and later high-rise ) housing. Some tourist sites were reconstructed during the East German era and after German reunification. Today over 50 % of the city´s buildings date back to before 1950.

===GDR===

After the dissolution of the Länder (states) in the GDR in 1952, Chemnitz became seat of a district (). On 10 May 1953, the city was renamed by decision of the East German government to (German: &quot;Karl Marx City&quot;) after Karl Marx, in recognition of its industrial heritage and the Karl Marx Year marking the 135th anniversary of his birth and the 70th anniversary of his death. GDR Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl said:

After the city centre was destroyed in World War II, the East German authorities attempted to rebuild it to symbolise the conceptions of urban development of a socialist city. The layout of the city centre at that time was rejected in favour of a new road network. However, the original plans were not completed. In addition, the rapid development of housing took priority over the preservation of old buildings. So in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the centre as well as the periphery, large areas were built in apartment-block style, for example . The old buildings of the period, which still existed especially in the Kassberg, and quarters, were neglected and fell increasingly into dereliction.

===After reunification===
On 23 April 1990, a referendum on the future name of the city was held: 76% of the voters voted for the old name &quot;&quot;. On 1 June 1990, the city was officially renamed.

After the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, the city of Chemnitz faced several difficult tasks. Many inhabitants migrated to the former West Germany and unemployment in the region increased sharply; in addition Chemnitz did not have adequate shopping facilities, but this was increasingly demanded. Large shopping centers were constructed on the city periphery to the early 1990s.

Chemnitz is the only major German city whose centre was re-planned after 1990, similar to the reconstruction of several other German cities in the immediate post-war years. Plans for the recovery of a compressed city centre around the historic town hall in 1991 led to an urban design competition. This was announced internationally by the city and carried out with the help of the partner city of . The mooted project on an essentially unused area of the former city would be comparable in circumference with the in Berlin.

Numerous internationally renowned architects such as , and provided designs for a new city centre. The mid-1990s began the development of the inner city brownfield around the town hall to a new town. In Chemnitz city more than 66,000 square meters of retail space have emerged. With the construction of office and commercial building on the construction site &quot;B3&quot; at the court, the last gap in 2010 was closed in city centre image. The intensive development included demolition of partially historically valuable buildings from the period and was controversial. Between 1990 and 2007 more than 250 buildings were leveled.

In late August 2018 the city was the site of a series of protests that attracted at least 8,000 people. The protests were attended by far-right and Neo-Nazi groups. News outlets reported about mob violence and riots. The protests started after two immigrants from the Middle East were arrested in connection with the murder of Daniel H., a 35 year old German man, the son of a German mother and a Cuban father, which had happened on 26 August. Violent clashes occurred between far-right protesters and far-left counter protesters, leading to injuries. The mobs outnumbered the local police presence. There were reports that rightist protesters chased down dark skinned bystanders and those that appeared to be foreigners on the streets before more police arrived and intervened. The riots were widely condemned by media outlets and politicians throughout Germany, and were &quot;described as reminiscent of civil war and Nazi pogroms.&quot;

The reports of mob violence and riots were criticized as incorrect later on. The German language Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung corrected its earlier reports, stating that there had evidently been no mob violence but there have been sporadic encroachments. Minister President of Saxony Michael Kretschmer came to the same conclusion: &quot;there were no mobs and man hunts&quot;.

One week after the protests, a free &quot;Concert against the Right&quot; under the motto &quot;We are more&quot; (#wirsindmehr) attracted an audience of some 65,000 people. A one-minute silence commemorated the murdered Daniel H., the son of a German mother and a Cuban father. The concert itself has been criticized for far-left activities and violent song texts of some of the participating bands.

== Culture and sights ==
The city won the bid to be one of the two European Capitals of Culture (in 2025) on 28 October 2020, beating Hanover, Hildesheim, Magdeburg and Nuremberg.

Theater Chemnitz offers a variety of theatre: opera (opera house from 1909), plays, ballet and (puppets), and runs concerts by the orchestra Robert-Schumann-Philharmonie (founded 1832).

Tourist sights include the Kassberg neighborhood with 18th and 19th century buildings and the Karl Marx Monument by Lev Kerbel, nicknamed (a Saxon dialect word for head) by the locals. Landmarks include the Old Town Hall with its Renaissance portal (15th century), the castle on the site of the former monastery, and the area around the opera house and the old university. The most conspicuous landmark is the red tower built in the late 12th or early 13th century as part of the city wall.

The Chemnitz petrified forest is located in the courtyard of Kulturkaufhaus Tietz. It is one of the very few in existence, and dates back several million years (details shown in the Museum of Natural Sciences &quot;Museum für Naturkunde Chemnitz&quot;, founded 1859). Also within the city limits, in the district of Rabenstein, is the smallest castle in Saxony, Rabenstein Castle.

The city has changed considerably since German reunification. Most of its industry is now gone and the core of the city has been rebuilt with many shops as well as huge shopping centres. Many of these shops are international brands, including Zara, H&amp;M, Esprit, , Leiser Shoes, and Peek &amp; Cloppenburg. The large (Red Tower) shopping centre is very popular with young people.

The Chemnitz Industrial Museum is an Anchor Point of ERIH, the European Route of Industrial Heritage. Additional unique industrial monuments are located at the &quot;Schauplatz Eisenbahn&quot; (Saxon Railway Museum and Museum of Technology Cable Running System) in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf. The State Museum of Archaeology Chemnitz opened in 2014 and is located in the former Schocken Department Stores (architect: Erich Mendelsohn; opening of the department store: 1930).

The , formerly a bank, opened on 1 December 2007. , who lived in Munich, had a collection of some 2,500 pieces of modern art, including many paintings and drawings by , and others. The other great art museum in Chemnitz is located near central railway station, it is called &quot;Museum am Theaterplatz&quot; (erected 1909 as &quot;König-Albert-Museum&quot;). The is a municipal botanical garden, and the is a non-profit garden specializing in arctic and alpine plants. Near the city center is the &quot;Villa Esche&quot; located (Henry-van-de-Velde-museum). This historical house was built in 1902 in art-nouveau-style by van de Velde.

The City is home of the SCHLINGEL International Film Festival, a yearly festival created in 1996 and that focuses on cinema for young audiences.

== Administrative divisions ==
The city of Chemnitz consists of 39 neighborhoods. The neighborhoods of Einsiedel, Euba, Grüna, Klaffenbach, Kleinolbersdorf-Altenhain, Mittelbach, Röhrsdorf and Wittgensdorf are at the same time localities within the meaning of Sections 65 to 68 of the Saxon Municipal Code. These neighborhoods came in the wake of the last incorporation wave after 1990 as formerly independent municipalities to the city of Chemnitz and therefore enjoy this special position compared to the other parts of the city. These localities each have a local council, which, depending on the number of inhabitants of the locality concerned, comprises between ten and sixteen members as well as a chairman of the same. The local councils are to hear important matters concerning the locality. A final decision is, however, incumbent on the city council of the city of Chemnitz. The official identification of the districts by numbers is based on the following principle: Starting from the city center (neighborhoods Zentrum and Schloßchemnitz), all other parts of the city are assigned clockwise in ascending order the tenth place of their index, the one-digit is awarded in the direction of city periphery in ascending order.

The city area does not include a unified, closed settlement area after numerous incorporations. The rural settlements of mainly eastern districts are separated from the settlement area of the Chemnitz city center, whereas this partly continues over the western city limits to Limbach-Oberfrohna and Hohenstein-Ernstthal.

== Politics ==
=== Mayor===
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Dieter Noll of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who served from 1990 to 1991, followed by Joachim Pilz (CDU) until 1993. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. Peter Seifert of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) served from 1993 until 2006. Between 2006 and 2020 Barbara Ludwig (SPD) has served as mayor. Sven Schulze (SPD) was elected mayor in 2020.

Comparable to in Berlin, a whole new quarter of the city was constructed in recent years. New buildings include the department store by , with a façade by and Peek &amp; Cloppenburg clothing store by and Partner.

<text>Purim (; , ; see Name below) is a Jewish holiday that commemorates the saving of the Jewish people from annihilation at the hands of an official of the Achaemenid Empire named Haman, as it is recounted in the Book of Esther (usually dated to the late-5th or 4th centuries BCE).

Haman was the royal vizier to the Persian king Ahasuerus (Xerxes I or Artaxerxes I; and in Old Persian, respectively). His plans were foiled by Mordecai of the tribe of Benjamin, and Esther, Mordecai&#x27;s cousin and adopted daughter who had become queen of Persia after her marriage to Ahasuerus. The day of deliverance became a day of feasting and rejoicing among Jews.

According to the Scroll of Esther, &quot;they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor&quot;. Purim is celebrated among Jews by:
*Exchanging gifts of food and drink, known as .
*Donating charity to the poor, known as .
*Eating a celebratory meal with alcoholic beverages, known as or &quot;Mishteh&quot;.
*Public recitation of the Scroll of Esther (), or &quot;reading of the Megillah&quot;, usually in synagogue.
*Reciting additions to the daily prayers and the grace after meals, known as .
*Applying henna (Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews).

Other customs include wearing masks and costumes, public celebrations and parades (), eating (), and drinking wine.

According to the Hebrew calendar, Purim is celebrated annually on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Adar (and it is celebrated in Adar II in Hebrew leap years, which occur 7 times in every 19 years), the day following the victory of the Jews over their enemies, the 13th of Adar, a date now observed in most years with the fast of Esther. 

In cities that were protected by a surrounding wall at the time of Joshua, Purim is celebrated on the 15th of the month of Adar on what is known as , since fighting in the walled city of Shushan continued through the 14th day of Adar. Today, only in Jerusalem Purim is observed on the 15th, and in several other biblical settlements (such as Hebron and Shilo) it is celebrated on both dates because of doubts regarding their status as cities surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua.

==Name==
&quot;Purim&quot; is the plural of the Hebrew word (loan from Akkadian &quot;puru&quot;) meaning &quot;lot&quot;. Its use as the name of this festival comes from Esther 3:6–7, describing the choice of date:

==Purim narrative==

The Scroll of Esther takes place over 9 years and begins with a six-month drinking feast given by King Ahasuerus of the Persian Empire for the army and Media and the satraps and princes of the 127 provinces of his kingdom, concluding with a seven-day drinking feast for the inhabitants of Shushan (Susa), rich and poor, and a separate drinking feast for the women organized by Queen Vashti in the pavilion of the royal courtyard.

At this feast, Ahasuerus becomes thoroughly drunk, and prompted by his courtiers, orders his wife Vashti to &#x27;display her beauty&#x27; before the nobles and populace, while wearing her royal crown. Vashti&#x27;s refusal embarrasses him in front of his guests and prompts him to demote her from her position as queen. Ahasuerus then orders all of the beautiful women throughout the empire to be presented to him, so that he can choose a new queen to replace Vashti. One of these is Esther, who was orphaned at a young age and is being fostered by her first cousin Mordecai, a member of the Sanhedrin. She finds favor in the King&#x27;s eyes, and is made his new wife. Esther does not reveal her origins or that she is Jewish, as Mordecai told her not to. Based on the choice of words used in the text some rabbinic commentators state that she was actually Mordecai&#x27;s wife. 

Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by two palace guards Bigthan and Teresh to kill Ahasuerus. They are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai&#x27;s service to the King is recorded in the daily record of the court.

Ahasuerus appoints Haman as his viceroy. Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman&#x27;s disfavor as he refuses to bow down to him. Having found out that Mordecai is Jewish, Haman plans to kill not just Mordecai but the entire Jewish minority in the empire. Obtaining Ahasuerus&#x27; permission and funds to execute this plan, he casts lots () to choose the date on which to do this—the 14th of the month of Adar. When Mordecai finds out about the plans, he puts on sackcloth and ashes, a sign of mourning, publicly weeping and lamenting, and many other Jews in Shushan and other parts of Ahasuerus&#x27; empire do likewise, with widespread penitence and fasting. Esther discovers what has transpired; there follows an exchange of messages between her and Mordecai, with Hatach, one of the palace servants, as the intermediary. Mordecai requests that she intercede with the King on behalf of the embattled Jews; she replies that nobody is allowed to approach the King, under penalty of death.

Esther says she will fast and pray for three days and asks Mordechai to request that all Jews of Persia fast and pray for three days together with her. She will then approach the King to seek his help, despite the law against doing so, and declares, &#x27;If I perish, I perish.&#x27; On the third day, she seeks an audience with Ahasuerus, during which she invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai&#x27;s refusal to bow to him; egged on by his wife Zeresh and unidentified friends, he builds a gallows for Mordecai, with the intention to hang him there the very next day.

That night, Ahasuerus suffers from insomnia, and when the court&#x27;s daily records are read to him to help him fall asleep, he learns of the services rendered by Mordecai in the earlier plot against his life. Ahasuerus asks whether anything was done for Mordecai and is told that he received no recognition for saving the King&#x27;s life. Just then, Haman appears, and King Ahasuerus asks him what should be done for the man that the King wishes to honor. Thinking that the King is referring to Haman himself, Haman says that the honoree should be dressed in the King&#x27;s royal robes and led around on the King&#x27;s royal horse. To Haman&#x27;s horror, the king instructs Haman to render such honors to Mordecai.

Later that evening, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther&#x27;s second banquet, at which she reveals that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, which includes her. Ahasuerus becomes enraged and instead orders Haman hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai. The previous decree against the Jewish people could not be nullified, so the King allows Mordecai and Esther to write another decree as they wish. They decree that Jewish people may preemptively kill those thought to pose a lethal risk. As a result, on 13 Adar, 500 attackers and 10 of Haman&#x27;s sons are killed in Shushan. Throughout the empire 75,000 of the Jewish peoples&#x27; enemies are killed. On the 14th, another 300 are killed in Shushan. No spoils are taken.

Mordecai assumes the position of second in rank to Ahasuerus, and institutes an annual commemoration of the delivery of the Jewish people from annihilation.

==Scriptural and rabbinical sources==

The primary source relating to the origin of Purim is the Book of Esther, which became the last of the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible to be canonized by the Sages of the Great Assembly. It is dated to the 4th century BCE and according to the Talmud was a redaction by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordechai.

The in the Mishnah (redacted CE) records the laws relating to Purim. The accompanying Tosefta (redacted in the same period) and Gemara (in the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmud redacted CE and CE respectively) record additional contextual details such as Queen Vashti having been the daughter of Belshazzar as well as details that accord with Josephus&#x27; such as Esther having been of royal descent. Brief mention of Esther is made in Tractate ( 139b) and idolatry relating to worship of Haman is discussed in Tractate ( 61b).

The work Esther Rabbah is a Midrashic text divided in two parts. The first part dated to CE provides an exegetical commentary on the first two chapters of the Hebrew Book of Esther and provided source material for the . The second part may have been redacted as late as the 11th century CE, and contains commentary on the remaining chapters of Esther. It, too, contains the additional contextual material found in the (a chronicle of Jewish history from Adam to the age of Titus believed to have been written by Josippon or Joseph ben Gorion).

==Historical views==
===Traditional historians===

The 1st-century CE historian Josephus recounts the origins of Purim in Book 11 of his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. He follows the Hebrew Book of Esther but shows awareness of some of the additional material found in the Greek version (the Septuagint) in that he too identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes and provides the text of the king&#x27;s letter. He also provides additional information on the dating of events relative to Ezra and Nehemiah. Josephus also records the Persian persecution of Jews and mentions Jews being forced to worship at Persian-erected shrines.

The Josippon, a 10th-century CE compilation of Jewish history, includes an account of the origins of Purim in its chapter 4. It too follows the original biblical account and includes additional traditions matching those found in the Greek version and Josephus (whom the author claims as a source) with the exception of the details of the letters found in the latter works. It also provides other contextual information relating to Jewish and Persian history such as the identification of Darius the Mede as the uncle and father-in-law of Cyrus.

A brief Persian account of events is provided by Islamic historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari in his &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot; (completed 915 CE). Basing his account on Jewish and Christian sources, al-Tabari provides additional details such as the original Persian form &quot;Asturya&quot; for &quot;Esther&quot;. He places events during the rule of Ardashir Bahman (Artaxerxes II), but confuses him with Ardashir al-Tawil al-Ba (Artaxerxes I), while assuming Ahasuerus to be the name of a co-ruler. Another brief Persian account is recorded by Masudi in &quot;The Meadows of Gold&quot; (completed 947 CE). He refers to a Jewish woman who had married the Persian King Bahman (Artaxerxes II), and delivered her people, thus corroborating this identification of Ahasuerus. He also mentions the woman&#x27;s daughter, Khumay, who is not known in Jewish tradition but is well remembered in Persian folklore. Al-Tabari calls her &quot;Khumani&quot; and tells how her father (Ardashir Bahman) married her. Ferdowsi in his &quot;Shahnameh&quot; ( CE) also tells of King Bahman marrying Khumay.

Modern Biblical scholarship generally identifies Ahasuerus with Xerxes I of Persia.

===Modern scholarship views===
Since the 1890s, several academics have suggested that Purim has its origin in a euhemerized Babylonian or Persian myth or festival (though which one is a subject of discussion). Other scholars find these hypotheses unlikely.

==Observances==

Purim has more of a national than a religious character, and its status as a holiday is on a different level from those days ordained holy by the Torah. Hallel is not recited. As such, according to some authorities, business transactions and even manual labor are allowed on Purim under certain circumstances. A special prayer ( – &quot;For the Miracles&quot;) is inserted into the Amidah prayers during evening, morning and afternoon prayer services, and is also included in the (&quot;Grace after Meals&quot;).

The four main mitzvot (obligations) of the day are:
# Listening to the public reading, usually in synagogue, of the Book of Esther in the evening and again in the following morning ()
# Sending food gifts to friends ()
# Giving charity to the poor ()
# Eating a festive meal ()

The three latter obligations apply only during the daytime hours of Purim.
===Reading of the Megillah===
The first religious ceremony which is ordained for the celebration of Purim is the reading of the Book of Esther (the &quot;Megillah&quot;) in the synagogue, a regulation which is ascribed in the Talmud (Megillah 2a) to the Sages of the Great Assembly, of which Mordecai is reported to have been a member. Originally this regulation was only supposed to be observed on the 14th of Adar; later, however, Rabbi Joshua ben Levi (3rd century CE) prescribed that the Megillah should also be read on the eve of Purim. Further, he obliged women to attend the reading of the Megillah, because women were also part of the miracle. The commentaries offer two reasons as to why women played a major role in the miracle. The first reason is that it was through a lady, Queen Esther, that the miraculous deliverance of the Jews was accomplished (Rashbam). The second reason is that women were also threatened by the genocidal decree and were therefore equal beneficiaries of the miracle (Tosafot).
The Talmud prescribed three benedictions before the reading and one benediction after the reading. The Talmud added other provisions. For example, the reader is to pronounce the names of the ten sons of Haman in one breath, to indicate their simultaneous death. An additional custom that probably began in medieval times is that the congregation recites aloud with the reader the verses Esther 2:5, Esther 8:15–16, and Esther 10:3, which relate the origin of Mordecai and his triumph.

The Megillah is read with a cantillation (a traditional chant) which is different from that which is used in the customary reading of the Torah. Besides the traditional cantillation, there are several verses or short phrases in the Megillah that are chanted in a different chant, the chant that is traditionally used during the reading of the book of Lamentations. These verses are particularly sad, or they refer to Jews being in exile. When the Megillah reader jumps to the melody of the book of Lamentations for these phrases, it heightens the feeling of sadness in the listener.

In some places, the Megillah is not chanted, but is read like a letter, because of the name (&quot;epistle&quot;), which is applied to the Book of Esther. It has been also customary since the time of the early medieval era of the Geonim to unroll the whole Megillah before reading it, to give it the appearance of an epistle. According to halakha (Jewish law), the Megillah may be read in any language intelligible to the audience.

According to the Mishnah (Megillah 30b), the story of the attack on the Jews by Amalek, the progenitor of Haman, is also to be read.

====Blessings before Megillah reading====
Before the reading of the Megillah on Purim, both at night and again in the morning, the reader of the Megillah recites the following three blessings and at the end of each blessing the congregation then responds by answering &quot;Amen&quot; after each of the blessings. At the morning reading of the Megillah the congregation should have in mind that the third blessing applies to the other observances of the day as well as to the reading of the Megillah:

====Blessing and recitations after Megillah reading====
After the Megillah reading, each member of the congregation who has heard the reading recites the following blessing. This blessing is not recited unless a was present for the Megillah reading:

After the nighttime Megillah reading the following two paragraphs are recited:

The first one is an acrostic poem that starts with each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, starting with &quot;Who balked () the counsel of the nations and annulled the counsel of the cunning. When a wicked man stood up against us (), a wantonly evil branch of Amalek&#x27;s offspring ...&quot; and ending with &quot;The rose of Jacob () was cheerful and glad, when they jointly saw Mordechai robed in royal blue. You have been their eternal salvation (), and their hope throughout generations.&quot;

The second is recited at night, but after the morning Megillah reading only this is recited:

The rose of Jacob was cheerful and glad, when they jointly saw Mordechai robed in royal blue. You have been their eternal salvation, and their hope throughout generations.

At night and in the morning:

====Women and Megillah reading====

Women have an obligation to hear the Megillah because &quot;they also were involved in that miracle.&quot; Orthodox communities, including most Modern Orthodox ones, however, generally do not allow women to lead the Megillah reading. Rabbinic authorities who hold that women should not read the Megillah for themselves, because of an uncertainty as to which blessing they should recite upon the reading, nonetheless agree that they have an obligation to hear it read. According to these authorities if women, or men for that matter, cannot attend the services in the synagogue, the Megillah should be read for them in private by any male over the age of thirteen. Often in Orthodox communities there is a special public reading only for women, conducted either in a private home or in a synagogue, but the Megillah is read by a man.

Some Modern Orthodox leaders have held that women can serve as public Megillah readers. Women&#x27;s megillah readings have become increasingly common in more liberal Modern Orthodox Judaism, though women may only read for other women, according to Ashkenazi authorities.

====Blotting out Haman&#x27;s name====
When Haman&#x27;s name is read out loud during the public chanting of the Megillah in the synagogue, which occurs 54 times, the congregation engages in noise-making to blot out his name. The practice can be traced back to the Tosafists (the leading French and German rabbis of the 13th century). In accordance with a passage in the Midrash, where the verse &quot;Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek&quot; is explained to mean &quot;even from wood and stones.&quot; A custom developed of writing the name of Haman, the offspring of Amalek, on two smooth stones, and knocking them together until the name was blotted out. Some wrote the name of Haman on the soles of their shoes, and at the mention of the name stamped with their feet as a sign of contempt. Another method was to use a noisy ratchet, called a (from the Hebrew , meaning &quot;noise&quot;) and in Yiddish a . Some of the rabbis protested against these uproarious excesses, considering them a disturbance of public worship, but the custom of using a ratchet in the synagogue on Purim is now almost universal, with the exception of Spanish and Portuguese Jews and other Sephardic Jews, who consider them an improper interruption of the reading.

===Food gifts and charity===
The Book of Esther prescribes &quot;the sending of portions one man to another, and gifts to the poor&quot;. According to halakha, each adult must give at least two different foods to one person, and at least two charitable donations to two poor people. The food parcels are called (&quot;sending of portions&quot;), and in some circles the custom has evolved into a major gift-giving event.

To fulfill the mitzvah of giving charity to two poor people, one can give either food or money equivalent to the amount of food that is eaten at a regular meal. It is better to spend more on charity than on the giving of . In the synagogue, regular collections of charity are made on the festival and the money is distributed among the needy. No distinction is made among the poor; anyone who is willing to accept charity is allowed to participate. It is obligatory for the poorest Jew, even one who is himself dependent on charity, to give to other poor people.

===Purim meal and festive drinking===

On Purim day, a festive meal called the is held.

There is a longstanding custom of drinking wine at the feast. The Talmud (b. Megillah 7b) records that &quot;Rava said: A person is obligated to become intoxicated on Purim, until they cannot distinguish between &#x27;Blessed be Mordecai&#x27; and &#x27;Cursed be Haman&#x27;&quot;. Several interpretations arose among the late medieval authorities, although in general the classical sources are unanimous in rejecting intoxicated excess; only beginning with the Hasidic masters was drunkenness occasionally endorsed. Maimonides writes that one must &quot;drink wine until drunk, and pass out from drink&quot;; according to one view, he is interpreting the Talmud this way (a sleeping person cannot distinguish), but according to another, he is intentionally contradicting it. Joseph Karo writes that one must &quot;never become drunk, as this is totally forbidden and leads to terrible sins. Rather, one must drink slightly more than usual&quot;, while Moses Isserles writes that one may drink more or less, so long as the intent is pure. Yechiel Michel Epstein suggests that &quot;until&quot; should be read exclusively, so that one is obligated to become drunk but not so drunk that they cannot distinguish Mordecai and Haman.

===Fasts===

The Fast of Esther, observed before Purim, on the 13th of Adar, is an original part of the Purim celebration, referred to in Esther 9:31–32. The first who mentions the Fast of Esther is Aḥai of Shabḥa (8th century CE) in &quot;She&#x27;iltot&quot; 4; the reason there given for its institution is based on an interpretation of Esther 9:18, Esther 9:31 and Talmud Megillah 2a: &quot;The 13th was the time of gathering&quot;, which gathering is explained to have had also the purpose of public prayer and fasting. Some, however, used to fast three days in commemoration of the fasting of Esther; but as fasting was prohibited during the month of Nisan, the first and second Mondays and the Thursday following Purim were chosen. The fast of the 13th is still commonly observed; but when that date falls on Shabbat, the fast is pushed back to the preceding Thursday, Friday being needed to prepare for Sabbath and the following Purim festival.

==Customs==
===Greetings===
It is common to greet one another on Purim in Hebrew with (, in Yiddish with () or in Ladino with . The Hebrew greeting loosely translates to &#x27;Happy Purim Holiday&#x27; and the Yiddish and Ladino translate to &#x27;Happy Purim&#x27;.

===Masquerading===

The custom of masquerading in costumes and the wearing of masks probably originated among the Italian Jews at the end of the 15th century. The concept was possibly influenced by the Roman carnival and spread across Europe. The practice was only introduced into Middle Eastern countries during the 19th century. The first Jewish codifier to mention the custom was Judah Minz. Iranian Jews use traditional Persian costumes and masks. 

The primary reason for masquerading is that it alludes to the hidden aspect of the miracle of Purim, which was &quot;disguised&quot; by natural events but was really the work of the Almighty. Since charity is a central feature of the day, when givers and/or recipients disguise themselves this also allows greater anonymity thus preserving the dignity of the recipient. 

Additional explanations are based on:
*Targum on Esther (Chapter 3) which states that Haman&#x27;s hate for Mordecai stemmed from Jacob&#x27;s &#x27;dressing up&#x27; like Esau to receive Isaac&#x27;s blessings;
*Others who &quot;dressed up&quot; or hid whom they were in the story of Esther:
**Esther not revealing that she is a Jewess;
**Mordecai wearing sackcloth;
**Mordecai being dressed in the king&#x27;s clothing;
**&quot;[M]any from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them&quot; (); on which the Vilna Gaon comments that those gentiles were not accepted as converts because they only made themselves look Jewish on the outside, as they did this out of fear;
*To recall the episodes that only happened in &quot;outside appearance&quot; as stated in Talmud Megillah 12a) that the Jews bowed to Haman only from the outside, internally holding strong to their Jewish belief, and likewise, God only gave the appearance as if he was to destroy all the Jews while internally knowing that he will save them.

===Burning of Haman&#x27;s effigy===
As early as the 5th century, there was a custom to burn an effigy of Haman on Purim. Prohibitions were issued against such displays under the reign of Flavius Augustus Honorius (395–423) and of Theodosius II (408–450). The custom was popular during the Geonic period (9th and 10th centuries), and a 14th century scholar described how people would ride through the streets of Provence holding fir branches and blowing trumpets around a puppet of Haman which was hanged and later burnt. The practice continued into the 20th century, with children treating Haman as a sort of &quot;Guy Fawkes.&quot; In the early 1950s, the custom was still observed in Iran and some remote communities in Kurdistan where young Muslims would sometimes join in.

===Purim spiel===
A Purim &quot;spiel&quot; (Purim play) is a comic dramatization that attempts to convey the saga of the Purim story. By the 18th century, in some parts of Eastern Europe, the Purim plays had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance for which the story of Esther was little more than a pretext. Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical stories. Today, Purim spiels can revolve around anything relating to Jews, Judaism, or even community gossip that will bring cheer and comic relief to an audience celebrating the day.

===Songs===
Songs associated with Purim are based on sources that are Talmudic, liturgical and cultural. Traditional Purim songs include (&quot;When [the Hebrew month of] Adar enters, we have a lot of joy&quot;—Mishnah Taanith 4:1) and (&quot;The Jews had light and gladness, joy and honor&quot;—Esther 8:16). The prayer is sung at the conclusion of the Megillah reading. A number of children&#x27;s songs (with non-liturgical sources) also exist: &quot;Once There Was a Wicked Wicked Man&quot;, , &quot;Chag Purim, Chag Purim, Chag Gadol Hu LaYehudim&quot;, , , , , , , , , .

===Traditional foods===

On Purim, Ashkenazi Jews and Israeli Jews (of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic descent) eat triangular pastries called hamantaschen (&quot;Haman&#x27;s pockets&quot;) or (&quot;Haman&#x27;s ears&quot;). A sweet pastry dough is rolled out, cut into circles, and traditionally filled with a raspberry, apricot, date, or poppy seed filling. More recently, flavors such as chocolate have also gained favor, while non-traditional experiments such as pizza hamantaschen also exist. The pastry is then wrapped up into a triangular shape with the filling either hidden or showing.

Among Sephardic Jews, a fried pastry called fazuelos is eaten, as well as a range of baked or fried pastries called Orejas de Haman (Haman&#x27;s Ears) or Hojuelas de Haman. The Sephardic Jewish community in Jerusalem traditionally served Baklavas, Kadayıf, Travadicos, Figuela, Tichpichtil, and Ma&#x27;amoul during Purim. &quot;Travadicos&quot; is a term for a deep-fried version of &quot;bourekitas&quot; that is soaked in honey and filled with nuts. This name is used among Jews in Turkey, while for Jews in Greece, the same dish is known as &quot;bourekitas de muez&quot;. 

Seeds, nuts, legumes and green vegetables are customarily eaten on Purim, as the Talmud relates that Queen Esther ate only these foodstuffs in the palace of Ahasuerus, since she had no access to kosher food.

Kreplach, a kind of dumpling filled with cooked meat, chicken or liver and served in soup, are traditionally served by Ashkenazi Jews on Purim. &quot;Hiding&quot; the meat inside the dumpling serves as another reminder of the story of Esther, the only book of Hebrew scriptures besides The Song of Songs that does not contain a single reference to God, who seems to hide behind the scenes. Some Sephardic Jews traditionally eat cooked green fava beans in remembrance of Esther, who, in Ahasuerus&#x27; palace, could not consume meat and thus had to rely on vegetarian dishes. In the Middle Ages, European Jews would eat , a type of blintz or waffle. Arany galuska, a dessert consisting of fried dough balls and vanilla custard, is traditional for Jews from Hungary and Romania, as well as their descendants.

Special breads are baked among various communities. In Moroccan Jewish communities, a Purim bread called &quot;ojos de Haman&quot; (&quot;eyes of Haman&quot;) is sometimes baked in the shape of Haman&#x27;s head, and the eyes, made of eggs, are plucked out to demonstrate the destruction of Haman. Among Polish Jews, &quot;koilitch&quot;, a raisin Purim challah that is baked in a long twisted ring and topped with small colorful candies, is meant to evoke the colorful nature of the holiday.

===Torah learning===
There is a widespread tradition to study the Torah in a synagogue on Purim morning, during an event called &quot;Yeshivas Mordechai Hatzadik&quot; to commemorate all the Jews who were inspired by Mordechai to learn Torah to overturn the evil decree against them. Children are especially encouraged to participate with prizes and sweets due to the fact that Mordechai taught many children Torah during this time.

==In Jerusalem==

===Shushan Purim===
Shushan Purim falls on Adar 15 and is the day on which Jews in Jerusalem celebrate Purim. The day is also universally observed by omitting the tachanun prayer and having a more elaborate meal than on ordinary days.

Purim is celebrated on Adar 14 because the Jews in unwalled cities fought their enemies on Adar 13 and rested the following day. However, in Shushan, the capital city of the Achaemenid Empire, the Jews were involved in defeating their enemies on Adar 13–14 and rested on the 15th (Esther 9:20–22). In commemoration of this, it was decided that while the victory would be celebrated universally on Adar 14, for Jews living in Shushan, the holiday would be held on Adar 15. Later, in deference to Jerusalem, the Sages determined that Purim would be celebrated on Adar 15 in all cities a wall had enclosed at the time of Joshua&#x27;s conquest of Canaan. This criterion allowed the city of Jerusalem to retain its importance for Jews, and although Shushan was not walled at the time of Joshua, it was made an exception since the miracle occurred there.

Today, there is debate as to whether outlying neighborhoods of Jerusalem are obliged to observe Purim on the 14th or 15th of Adar. Further doubts have arisen as to whether other cities were sufficiently walled in Joshua&#x27;s era. It is therefore customary in certain towns including Hebron, Safed, Tiberias, Acre, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Beersheva, Beit She&#x27;an, Beit Shemesh, Gaza, Gush Halav, Haifa, Jaffa, Lod, Ramlah, and Shechem to celebrate Purim on the 14th and hold an additional &quot;megillah&quot; reading on the 15th with no blessings. In the diaspora, Jews in Baghdad, Damascus, Prague, and elsewhere celebrate Purim on the 14th and hold an additional &quot;megillah&quot; reading on the 15th with no blessings. Since today we are not sure where the walled cities from Joshua&#x27;s time are, the only city that currently celebrates only Shushan Purim is Jerusalem; however, Rabbi Yoel Elizur has written that residents of Bet El and Mevo Horon should observe only the 15th, like Jerusalem.

Outside of Jerusalem, Hasidic Jews don their holiday clothing on Shushan Purim, and may attend a &quot;tish&quot; and even give &quot;mishloach manot&quot;; however, this is just a custom and not a religious obligation.

===Purim Meshulash===
Purim Meshulash, or the three-fold Purim, is a somewhat rare calendric occurrence that affects how Purim is observed in Jerusalem (and, in theory at least, in other cities that were surrounded by a wall in ancient times).

When Shushan Purim (Adar 15) falls on the Sabbath, the holiday is celebrated over a period of three days. The &quot;megilla&quot; reading and distribution of charity takes place on the Friday (Adar 14), which day is called Purim dePrazos. The &quot;Al ha-Nissim&quot; prayer is only recited on Sabbath (Adar 15), which is Purim itself. The weekly Torah portion (&quot;Tetzaveh&quot; or &quot;Ki Tissa&quot; in regular years, &quot;Tzav&quot; in leap years) is read as usual, while the Torah portion for Purim is read for &quot;maftir,&quot; and the &quot;haftarah&quot; is the same as read the previous Shabbat, Parshat Zachor. On Sunday (Adar 16), called Purim Meshullash, &quot;mishloach manot&quot; are sent and the festive Purim meal is held.

The minimum interval between occurrences of Purim Meshulash is three years (1974 to 1977; 2005 to 2008; will occur again 2045 to 2048). The maximum interval is 20 years (1954 to 1974; will occur again 2025 to 2045). Other possible intervals are four years (1977 to 1981; 2001 to 2005; 2021 to 2025; will occur again 2048 to 2052); seven years (1994 to 2001; will occur again 2123 to 2130); 13 years (1981 to 1994; 2008 to 2021; will occur again 2130 to 2143); and 17 years (1930 to 1947; will occur again 2275 to 2292).

==Other Purims==

===Purim Katan===
During leap years on the Hebrew calendar, Purim is celebrated in the second month of Adar. (The Karaites, however, celebrate it in the first month of Adar.) The 14th of the first Adar is then called &quot;Purim Katan&quot; (&quot;Little Purim&quot; in Hebrew) and the 15th is &quot;Shushan Purim Katan&quot;, for which there are no set observances but it has a minor holiday aspect to it. The distinctions between the first and the second Purim in leap years are mentioned in the Mishnah. Certain prayers like Tachanun, Eil Erech Apayim (when 15 Adar I is a Monday or Thursday) and Lam&#x27;nazteach (Psalm 20) are omitted during the service. When 15th Adar I is on Shabbat, &quot;Av Harachamim&quot; is omitted. When either 13th or 15th Adar I falls on Shabbat, &quot;Tzidkas&#x27;cha&quot; is omitted at Mincha. Fasting is prohibited.

===Communal and familial Purims===

Historically, many Jewish communities around the world established local &quot;Purims&quot; to commemorate their deliverance from catastrophe or an antisemitic ruler or edict. One of the best known is &quot;Purim Vinz&quot;, traditionally celebrated in Frankfurt one week after the regular Purim. Purim Vinz commemorates the Fettmilch uprising (1616–1620), in which one Vincenz Fettmilch attempted to exterminate the Jewish community. According to some sources, the influential Rabbi Moses Sofer (the &quot;Chasam Sofer&quot;), who was born in Frankfurt, celebrated Purim Vintz every year, even when he served as a rabbi in Pressburg.

Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller (1579–1654) of Kraków, Poland, asked that his family henceforth celebrate a private Purim, marking the end of his many troubles, including having faced trumped-up charges. Since Purim is preceded by a fast day, the rabbi also directed his descendants to have a (private) fast day, the 5th day of Tamuz, marking one of his imprisonments (1629), this one lasting for 40 days.

The Jewish community of Hebron has celebrated two historic Purims, both from the Ottoman period. One is called Window Purim, or Purim Taka, in which the community was saved when a bag of money mysteriously appeared in a window, enabling them to pay off an extortion fee to the Ottoman Pasha. Many record the date being the 14th of the month, which corresponds the date of Purim on 14 Adar. The other was called The Purim of Ibrahim Pasha, in which the community was saved during a battle.

Other historic Purim celebrations in Jewish history have occurred in Yemen, Italy, Vilna and other locations.

==In modern history==
Adolf Hitler banned and forbade the observance of Purim. In a speech made on 10 November 1938 (the day after Kristallnacht), the Nazi politician and prominent anti-Semite Julius Streicher surmised that just as &quot;the Jew butchered 75,000 Persians&quot; in one night, the same fate would have befallen the German people had the Jews succeeded in inciting a war against Germany; the &quot;Jews would have instituted a new Purim festival in Germany&quot;.

Nazi attacks against Jews were often coordinated with Jewish festivals. On Purim 1942, ten Jews were hanged in Zduńska Wola to &quot;avenge&quot; the hanging of Haman&#x27;s ten sons. In a similar incident in 1943, the Nazis shot ten Jews from the Piotrków ghetto. On Purim eve that same year, over 100 Jewish doctors and their families were shot by the Nazis in Częstochowa. The following day, Jewish doctors were taken from Radom and shot nearby in Szydłowiec. In 1942, on Purim, the Nazis murdered over 5000 Jews, mostly children, in the Minsk Ghetto. All of the victims were shot and buried alive by the Nazis.

Still, the Nazi regime was defied and Purim was celebrated in Nazi ghettos and elsewhere.

In an apparent connection made by Hitler between his Nazi regime and the role of Haman, Hitler stated in a speech made on 30 January 1944, that if the Nazis were defeated, the Jews would celebrate &quot;a second Purim&quot;. Indeed, Julius Streicher was reported to remark ironically &quot;Purimfest 1946&quot; as he ascended the scaffold to the gallows after Nuremberg. According to Rabbi Mordechai Neugroschel, there is a code in the Book of Esther which lies in the names of Haman&#x27;s 10 sons. Three of the Hebrew letters—a tav, a shin and a zayin—are written smaller than the rest, while a vav is written larger. The outsized vav—which represents the number six—corresponds to the sixth millennium of the world since creation, which, according to Jewish tradition, is the period between 1240 and 2240 CE. As for the tav, shin and zayin, their numerical values add up to 707. Put together, these letters refer to the Jewish year 5707, which corresponds to the secular 1946–1947. In his research, Neugroschel noticed that ten Nazi defendants in the Nuremberg Trials were executed by hanging on 16 October 1946, which was the date of the final judgement day of Judaism, Hoshana Rabbah. Additionally, Hermann Göring, an eleventh Nazi official sentenced to death, committed suicide, parallel to Haman&#x27;s daughter in Tractate Megillah.

There is a tale in the Hasidic Chabad movement that Joseph Stalin died as a result of some metaphysical intervention of the seventh Chabad leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, during the recitation of a discourse at a public Purim farbrengen. Stalin was suddenly paralyzed on 1 March 1953, which corresponds to Purim 1953, and died four days later. Due to Stalin&#x27;s death, nationwide pogroms against Jews throughout the Soviet Union were averted, as Stalin&#x27;s infamous doctors&#x27; plot was halted.

The 1991 Gulf War, during which Iraq launched 39 Scud missiles against Israel, ended on Purim.

The Cave of the Patriarchs massacre took place during Purim of 1994. The Dizengoff Center suicide bombing took place on the eve of Purim killing 13 on 4 March 1996.

In 2024, ahead of Purim, Israel&#x27;s Education Ministry issued a directive to schools and kindergartens about avoiding &quot;panic-inducing costumes&quot; in view of the ongoing Gaza war. Also, many places in Israel decided to cancel Purim events.

==In the media==
The 1960 20th Century-Fox film &quot;Esther and the King&quot; stars Joan Collins as Esther and Richard Egan as Ahasuerus. It was filmed in Italy by director Raoul Walsh. The 2006 movie &quot;One Night with the King&quot; chronicles the life of the young Jewish girl, Hadassah, who goes on to become the Biblical Esther, the Queen of Persia, and saves the Jewish nation from annihilation at the hands of its arch enemy while winning the heart of the fiercely handsome King Xerxes.

The 2006 comedy film &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; employs a film-within-a-film device in which the fictitious film being produced is titled &quot;Home for Purim&quot;, and is about a Southern Jewish family&#x27;s Purim celebration. However, once the film receives Oscar buzz, studio executives feel it is &quot;too Jewish&quot; and force the film to be renamed &quot;Home for Thanksgiving.&quot;

<text>The kroon (sign: KR; code: EEK) was the official currency of Estonia for two periods in history: 1928–1940 and 1992–2011. Between 1 January and 14 January 2011, the kroon circulated together with the euro, after which the euro became the sole legal tender in Estonia. The kroon was subdivided into 100 cents (&quot;senti&quot;; singular &quot;sent&quot;).

The word &quot;kroon&quot; (, “crown”) is related to that of the Nordic currencies (such as the Swedish krona and the Danish and Norwegian krone) and derived from the Latin word &quot;corona&quot; (&quot;crown&quot;). The kroon succeeded the mark in 1928 and was in use until the Soviet invasion in 1940 and Estonia&#x27;s subsequent incorporation into the Soviet Union when it was replaced by the Soviet ruble. After Estonia regained its independence, the kroon was reintroduced in 1992 and replaced by the euro in 2011.

==First kroon, 1928–1940==

===History===
The kroon became the currency of Estonia on 1 September 1928 after having been a unit of account since 1924. It replaced the mark at a rate of 100 marks = 1 kroon. The kroon was subdivided into 100 &quot;senti&quot;.

In 1924, the kroon was pegged to the Swedish krona at par, with a gold standard of 2,480 KR = 1 kilogram of pure gold. The standard received real coverage with the reserves backing the kroon. The issue of treasury notes and exchange notes was terminated. In order to secure the credibility of the kroon, the Bank of Estonia exchanged kroon for foreign currency. All these measures restored confidence in the domestic banking and monetary sector, contributing to the economic reinvigoration of the country and to the improvement of the reputation of the Estonian state in the international arena.

During the Great Depression in 1933, the kroon went off the gold standard, devalued 35% and obtained a currency peg with sterling at £1 stg = 18.35 KR. The Estonian kroon kept this peg and circulated until the Soviet occupation of 1940. The kroon was exchanged for the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 Rbl = 0.8 KR.

===Banknotes and coins===
In 1928, the first coins of this currency were issued, nickel-bronze 25 senti pieces. These were followed by bronze 1 sent in 1929, silver 2 krooni in 1930, bronze 5 senti and nickel-bronze 10 senti in 1931, silver 1 kroon in 1933, bronze 2 senti and aluminium-bronze 1 kroon in 1934, nickel-bronze 20 senti in 1935, nickel-bronze 50 senti in 1936.

On 25 July 1940, 4 days after the founding of the Estonian SSR, the last Estonian pre-WW II coin, the new 1 sent (date 1939), was issued.

In 1927, before the kroon was officially introduced, 100 mark banknotes circulated overprinted as &quot;ÜKS KROON&quot; (1 kroon). Eesti Pank introduced 10 krooni notes in 1928, followed by 5 KR and 50 KR in 1929, 20 KR in 1932 and 100 KR in 1935.
==Second kroon, 1992–2010==

===History===
The kroon was reintroduced as Estonia&#x27;s currency on 20 June 1992, replacing the Soviet rouble at a rate of 1 KR = 10 Rbls. (Each person was able to change a maximum of 1,500 Rbls to 150 KR.) Initially, the Estonian kroon was pegged to the Deutsche Mark at a rate of 8 KR = DM 1. After the introduction of the euro the fixed exchange rate of DM 1.95583 to the euro led to an exchange rate of 15.64664 KR to the euro. On 28 June 2004, as Estonia joined the ERM II-system, the central parity of the Estonian kroon was revalued (by less than 0.001%) to 15.6466 KR per euro. On 1 January 2011 the euro replaced the kroon as the official currency of Estonia. The kroon circulated alongside the euro until 15 January 2011 at which point it ceased to be legal tender. However, the Eesti Pank will indefinitely exchange kroon banknotes and coins in any amount into euro.

===Banknotes===
In 1992, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 100, and 500 krooni. Some of the 5, 10, 25, 100, and 500 krooni notes were dated 1991. In 1994, a 50 KR note was introduced. Unlike others, the 1 KR and 50 KR notes were issued only once.

Notes in circulation before being replaced by the euro:
*1 KR (1992),
*2 KR (1992, 2006, 2007),
*5 KR (1991, 1992, 1994),
*10 KR (1991, 1992, 1994, 2006, 2007),
*25 KR (1991, 1992, 2002, 2007),
*50 KR (1994),
*100 KR (1991, 1992, 1994, 1999, 2007),
*500 KR (1991, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2007).

===Coins===

In 1992, coins were introduced (some dated 1991) in denominations of 5, 10, 20, &amp; 50 senti, as well as 1 KR. The 1 KR was struck in cupronickel, the others in aluminum-bronze. However, in 1997, nickel-plated steel 20 senti were introduced, followed by aluminum-bronze 1 KR in 1998. 5 senti coins were not issued after 1994 but were still legal tender. The cupronickel 1 KR coins from 1992, 1993 and 1995 were demonetized on 31 May 1998 because they were too similar in weight and composition to DM 1 coins, and new 1 KR coins were issued. The 5 KR coins were commemorative pieces and were rarely seen in circulation.

Coins in circulation before being replaced by the euro:
*5 senti (1991, 1992, 1995)
*10 senti (1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2008)
*20 senti (1992, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2008)
*50 senti (1992, 2004, 2006, 2007)
*1 kroon (1992, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2008)
*5 krooni (1993, 1994).

<doc id="193459" wikidata="Q1770846" url="?curid=193459" title="Samuel Rawson Gardiner">
<text>Samuel Rawson Gardiner (4 March 1829 – 24 February 1902) was an English historian who specialized in 17th-century English history as a prominent foundational historian of the Puritan revolution and the English Civil War.

==Life==
The son of Rawson Boddam Gardiner, he was born in Ropley, Hampshire. He was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford, where he obtained a first class in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot;. He was subsequently elected to fellowships at All Souls (1884) and Merton (1892). For some years he was professor of modern history at King&#x27;s College London, and devoted his life to the subject. In 1896 he was elected to give the first series of Ford Lectures at Oxford University. He died in Sevenoaks, aged 72.

==Puritan Revolution==
Gardiner published his history of the Puritan Revolution and English Civil War in three series of 19 volumes, originally published under different titles, beginning with the accession of King James I of England. Following Gardiner&#x27;s death, it was completed in two volumes by Charles Harding Firth as &quot;The Last Years of the Protectorate&quot; (1909).

The series is &quot;History of England from the Accession of James I to the Outbreak of the Civil War, 1603–1642&quot; (10 vols. 1883–4); &quot;History of the Great Civil War, 1642–1649&quot; (5 vols. 1893); and &quot;History of the Commonwealth and Protectorate, 1649–1660&quot; (4 vol. 1903). Gardiner&#x27;s treatment of the subject is exhaustive and philosophical, taking in political and constitutional history, the changes in religion, thought and sentiment, their causes and their tendencies. Of his original sources, many exist only in manuscript, and his researches in public and private collections of manuscripts at home, and in the archives of Simancas, Venice, Rome, Brussels and Paris, were tireless and productive.

Gardiner may have been drawn to the period by the fact that he was descended from Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton, but it is said that his judgments were unbiased, and his appreciations of character reveal fine perception and broad sympathies, as shown in his analyses of the characters of James I, Francis Bacon, William Laud, and Thomas Wentworth, as well as Oliver Cromwell.

On constitutional matters, Gardiner is considered to write with an insight achieved by the study of political philosophy, discussing in a masterly fashion the dreams of idealists and the schemes of government proposed by statesmen. Throughout his work he gives a prominent place to everything which illustrates human progress in moral and religious, as well as political conceptions, and specially to the rise and development of the idea of religious toleration, finding much of his source material in the writings of obscure pamphleteers, whose essays indicate currents of public opinion. His record of the relations between England and other states proves his thorough knowledge of contemporary European history, and is rendered specially valuable by his researches among manuscript sources which have enabled him to expound for the first time some intricate pieces of diplomacy.

Gardiner&#x27;s work is long and minute. He is apt to attach an exaggerated importance to some of the authorities which he was the first to bring to light, to see a general tendency in what may only be the expression of an individual eccentricity, to rely too much on ambassadors&#x27; reports which may have been written for some special end, to enter too fully into the details of diplomatic correspondence. His style is clear and unadorned, with more than a hint of Tacitus; he appeals to the intellect rather than to the emotions, and is seldom picturesque, though in describing a few famous scenes, such as the execution of Charles I, he writes with pathos and dignity.

By some estimations, the minuteness of his narrative detracts from its interest; though his arrangement is generally good, here and there the reader finds the thread of a subject broken by the intrusion of incidents not immediately connected with it, and does not pick it up again without an effort. And Gardiner has the defects of his supreme qualities, of his fairness and critical ability as a judge of character; his work lacks enthusiasm, and leaves the reader cold and unmoved. Yet, apart from its sterling excellence, it is not without beauties, for it is marked by loftiness of thought, a love of purity and truth, and refinement in taste and feeling.

Gardiner wrote other books, mostly on the same period, but his great history is that by which he is widely known, and considered a worthy result of a life of unremitting labor, and a noted example of historical scholarship. His position as a historian was formally acknowledged. In 1882 he was given a civil list pension of £150 per annum, &quot;in recognition of his valuable contributions to the history of England&quot;; he was honorary D.C.L. of Oxford, LL.D. of Edinburgh, and Ph.D. of Göttingen, and honorary Student of Christ Church, Oxford; and in 1894 he declined the appointment of Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, lest its duties should interfere with the accomplishment of his history.

Historian John Morrill said:
:Gardiner was a brilliant historian, who tested the veracity, accuracy, and biases of every source and picked his way through the evidence with a care and clarity of exposition which brooks no equal for this or any other period.

A standard modern study of Gardiner is Mark Nixon, &quot;Samuel Rawson Gardiner and the Idea of History&quot; (Royal Historical Society/Boydell Press, 2010).

In his paper the transplantation to Connaught He is clearly excusing the racist language and tactics of English soldiers who were demanding more &quot; native Irish are removed from Ireland&quot; by drawing an analogy &quot;between the Irish and equally loathsome Midianites&quot;.

==Evaluation of Oliver Cromwell==
As a foremost historian of the era, Gardiner&#x27;s evaluation of Oliver Cromwell is especially significant. No figure in English history has called forth a greater range of evaluations.

On the positive side Gardiner concluded: 
:&quot;The man—it is ever so with the noblest—was greater than his work. In his own heart lay the resolution to subordinate self to public ends, and to subordinate material to moral and spiritual objects of desire. He was limited by the defects which make imperfect the character and intellect even of the noblest and the wisest of mankind. He was limited still more by the unwillingness of his contemporaries to mould themselves after his ideas. The blows that he had struck against the older system had their enduring effects. Few wished for the revival of the absolute kingship, of the absolute authority of a single House of Parliament, or of the Laudian system of governing the Church...The living forces of England—forces making for the destruction of those barriers which he was himself breaking through, buoyed him up—as a strong and self-confident swimmer, he was carried onward by the flowing tide.&quot;

:&quot;In the latter portion of the Protector&#x27;s career it was far otherwise. His failure to establish a permanent Government was not due merely to his deficiency in constructive imagination. It was due rather to two causes: the umbrage taken at his position as head of an army whose interference in political affairs gave even more offence than the financial burdens it imposed on a people unaccustomed to regular taxation; and the reaction which set in against the spiritual claims of that Puritanism of which he had become the mouthpiece…. It was no reaction against the religious doctrines or ecclesiastical institutions upheld by the Protector that brought about the destruction of his system of government... So far as the reaction was not directed against militarism, it was directed against the introduction into the political world of what appeared to be too high a standard of morality, a reaction which struck specially upon Puritanism, but which would have struck with as much force upon any other form of religion which, like that upheld by Laud, called in the power of the State to enforce its claims. Even though Oliver was in his own person no sour fanatic, as Royalist pamphleteers after the Restoration falsely asserted; it is impossible to deny that he strove by acts of government to lead men into the paths of morality and religion beyond the limit which average human nature had fixed for itself.&quot;

:&quot;In dealing with foreign nations his mistake on this head was more conspicuous, because he had far less knowledge of the conditions of efficient action abroad than he had at home. It may fairly be said that he knew less of Scotland than of England, less of Ireland than of Great Britain, and less of the Continent than of any one of the three nations over which he ruled. It has sometimes been said that Oliver made England respected in Europe. It would be more in accordance with truth to say that he made her feared.&quot;

:&quot;Oliver&#x27;s claim to greatness can be tested by the undoubted fact that his character receives higher and wider appreciation as the centuries pass by. The limitations on his nature—the one-sidedness of his religious zeal, the mistakes of his policy—are thrust out of sight, the nobility of his motives, the strength of his character, and the breadth of his intellect, force themselves on the minds of generations for which the objects for which he strove have been for the most part attained, though often in a different fashion from that which he placed before himself. Even those who refuse to waste a thought on his spiritual aims remember with gratitude his constancy of effort to make England great by land and sea; and it would be well for them also to be reminded of his no less constant efforts to make England worthy of greatness.&quot;

==Family==

Gardiner married twice. First to Isabell Irving, daughter of Rev Edward Irving. After her death in 1878, he married fellow historian Bertha Cordey in 1883.

<text>Decarboxylation is a chemical reaction that removes a carboxyl group and releases carbon dioxide (CO2). Usually, decarboxylation refers to a reaction of carboxylic acids, removing a carbon atom from a carbon chain. The reverse process, which is the first chemical step in photosynthesis, is called carboxylation, the addition of CO2 to a compound. Enzymes that catalyze decarboxylations are called decarboxylases or, the more formal term, carboxy-lyases (EC number 4.1.1).

== In organic chemistry ==
The term &quot;decarboxylation&quot; usually means replacement of a carboxyl group () with a hydrogen atom:
Decarboxylation is one of the oldest known organic reactions. It is one of the processes assumed to accompany pyrolysis and destructive distillation. 

Overall, decarboxylation depends upon stability of the carbanion synthon , although the anion may not be a true chemical intermediate. Typically, carboxylic acids decarboxylate slowly, but carboxylic acids with an α electron-withdrawing group (e.g. βketo acids, βnitriles, αnitro acids, or arylcarboxylic acids) decarboxylate easily. Decarboxylation of sodium chlorodifluoroacetate generates difluorocarbene:

Decarboxylations are an important in the malonic and acetoacetic ester synthesis. The Knoevenagel condensation and they allow keto acids serve as a stabilizing protecting group for carboxylic acid enols. 

For the free acids, conditions that deprotonate the carboxyl group (possibly protonating the electron-withdrawing group to form a zwitterionic tautomer) accelerate decarboxylation. A strong base is key to ketonization, in which a pair of carboxylic acids combine to the eponymous functional group:
Transition metal salts, especially copper compounds, facilitate decarboxylation via carboxylate complex intermediates. Metals that catalyze cross-coupling reactions thus treat aryl carboxylates as an aryl anion synthon; this synthetic strategy is the decarboxylative cross-coupling reaction. 

Upon heating in cyclohexanone, amino acids decarboxylate. In the related Hammick reaction, uncatalyzed decarboxylation of a picolinic acid gives a stable carbene that attacks a carbonyl electrophile. 

Oxidative decarboxylations are generally radical reactions. These include the Kolbe electrolysis and Hunsdiecker-Kochi reactions. The Barton decarboxylation is an unusual radical reductive decarboxylation.

As described above, most decarboxylations start with a carboxylic acid or its alkali metal salt, but the Krapcho decarboxylation starts with methyl esters. In this case, the reaction begins with halide-mediated cleavage of the ester, forming the carboxylate.

== In biochemistry ==
Decarboxylations are pervasive in biology. They are often classified according to the cofactors that catalyze the transformations. Biotin-coupled processes effect the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA. Thiamine (T:) is the active component for decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids, including pyruvate:
:
Pyridoxal phosphate promotes decarboxylation of amino acids. Flavin-dependent decarboxylases are involved in transformations of cysteine.
Iron-based hydroxylases operate by reductive activation of using the decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate as an electron donor. The decarboxylation can be depicted as such:
:

===Decarboxylation of amino acids===
Common biosynthetic oxidative decarboxylations of amino acids to amines are:
* tryptophan to tryptamine
* phenylalanine to phenylethylamine
* tyrosine to tyramine
* histidine to histamine
* serine to ethanolamine
* glutamic acid to GABA
* lysine to cadaverine
* arginine to agmatine
* ornithine to putrescine
* 5-HTP to serotonin
* L-DOPA to dopamine

Other decarboxylation reactions from the citric acid cycle include:
* pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (see pyruvate decarboxylation)
* oxalosuccinate to α-ketoglutarate
* α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA.

===Fatty acid synthesis===

Straight-chain fatty acid synthesis occurs by recurring reactions involving decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA.

==Case studies==

Upon heating, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid decarboxylates to give the psychoactive compound Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol. When cannabis is heated in vacuum, the decarboxylation of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) appears to follow first order kinetics. The log fraction of THCA present decreases steadily over time, and the rate of decrease varies according to temperature. At 10-degree increments from 100 to 140 °C, half of the THCA is consumed in 30, 11, 6, 3, and 2 minutes; hence the rate constant follows Arrhenius&#x27; law, ranging between 10−8 and 10−5 in a linear log-log relationship with inverse temperature. However, modelling of decarboxylation of salicylic acid with a water molecule had suggested an activation barrier of 150 kJ/mol for a single molecule in solvent, much too high for the observed rate. Therefore, it was concluded that this reaction, conducted in the solid phase in plant material with a high fraction of carboxylic acids, follows a pseudo first order kinetics in which a nearby carboxylic acid precipitates without affecting the observed rate constant. Two transition states corresponding to indirect and direct keto-enol routes are possible, with energies of 93 and 104 kJ/mol. Both intermediates involve protonation of the alpha carbon, disrupting one of the double bonds of the aromatic ring and permitting the beta-keto group (which takes the form of an enol in THCA and THC) to participate in decarboxylation.

In beverages stored for long periods, very small amounts of benzene may form from benzoic acid by decarboxylation catalyzed by the presence of ascorbic acid.

The addition of catalytic amounts of cyclohexenone has been reported to catalyze the decarboxylation of amino acids. However, using such catalysts may also yield an amount of unwanted by-products.

<text>Amberg-Sulzbach () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It surrounds but does not include the city of Amberg. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Neustadt an der Waldnaab, Schwandorf, Neumarkt, Nürnberger Land and Bayreuth.

== History ==
The history is linked with the history of the Upper Palatinate and the city of Amberg.

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former district of Amberg and the district-free city of Sulzbach-Rosenberg (the latter lost its status as a district-free city in this administrative reform).

== Geography ==
The district is located in the geographical centre of Bavaria, 40 km east of Nuremberg. The main axis of the region is the Vils River (an affluent of the Naab) crossing the district from north to south. West of the river, the land rises to the Franconian Jura, while there are gentle hills on the eastern side in the angle between Naab and Vils. The district is mainly covered by forests, especially in its western half.

== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms displays:
* The Palatine Lion, which was the heraldic animal of the Upper Palatinate
* The lilies, which were a symbol of the counts of Sulzbach
* The mining tools are a reminder of the mining history of the Upper Palatinate

Let me not be misunderstood: richly as the valleys wave with corn, and beautiful as is the general aspect of modern Palestine, vestiges of the ancient cultivation are every where visible... proofs far more than sufficient that the land still enjoys her Sabbaths, and only waits the return of her banished children, and the application of industry commensurate with her agricultural capabilities, to burst once more into universal luxuriance—all that she ever was in the days of Solomon.&quot;

It would be of manifest importance to the Sultan to encourage the Jews to return and settle in Palestine because the wealth which they would bring with them would increase the resources of the Sultan&#x27;s dominions; and the Jewish people, if returning under the sanction and protection, and at the invitation of the Sultan, would be a check upon any future evil designs of Mehemet Ali (of Egypt) or his successor...

The man who should restore the Hebrew race to their country would be the Messiah – the real saviour of prophecy!&quot; He did not add formally that he aspired to play this part, but it was evidently implied.

<text>Sir Thomas Fairfax (1612-1671) was an English soldier from Yorkshire who led Parliament&#x27;s New Model Army from 1645 to 1650 during the Civil War against King Charles I. Because of his dark visage, he was known as &quot;Black Tom&quot; to his loyal troops.

He was the eldest son and heir of Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron, (Lord Fairfax) and succeeded to that title as 3rd Lord Fairfax in 1648 on the death of his father, although he was generally known as &quot;Sir Thomas Fairfax&quot; to distinguish them. He adopted the profession of arms as a young man, when he served under Horace Vere in the Netherlands. In 1637, he married Vere&#x27;s daughter Anne.

Fairfax was recalled to English service in 1639, for the first of King Charles&#x27; disastrous Bishops Wars against Scotland. When these defeats led to the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642, Lord Fairfax declared for Parliament and was named general of Parliament&#x27;s forces in the north, with Sir Thomas his second-in command. Sir Thomas later moved to join Parliament&#x27;s stronger Eastern Association army, with which he achieved several significant victories, notably the decisive Battle of Marston Moor. In January 1645, when Parliament &quot;new modelled&quot; its armies, he was named commander-in-chief, and under his leadership the Army forced the surrender of the king in 1646.

When Royalist uprisings broke out in 1648, Fairfax first subdued the insurgents in Kent, then laid siege to Colchester in Essex. After the radicals in the Army and their supporters in Parliament proposed in 1649 to try the king, Fairfax refused to participate in the trial and attempted to prevent the execution. In 1650, he resigned his commission and retired to his estate.

By 1660, seeing England fallen into disputes for power among rival factions, he backed General George Monck in his campaign that led to the restoration of the monarchy under King Charles II.

Not long afterward, he retired again from public life until his death in 1671.

==Origins==
Thomas Fairfax was born to a Yorkshire family that could trace its descent to the 13th century. His grandfather, Thomas Fairfax, 1st Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1560-1640) fought under the Earl of Essex in the defense of the Protestant Netherlands against Spain. His grandson Thomas was born on 17 January 1612 at Denton Hall, Yorkshire, to Ferdinano Fairfax and his first wife, Mary, daughter of Edmund Sheffield, 1st Earl of Mulgrave. There was a younger brother, Charles, born 22 March 1614. 

He was educated at St John&#x27;s College Cambridge, matriculating at age 14 in 1626. and admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn for the study of law on 26 May 1628. But his grandfather, old Lord Thomas Fairfax, wanted to see this grandson and namesake follow him into the wars for Protestantism, and young Thomas joined the forces of Horace Vere in the Netherlands by 1630.

During the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the Netherlands became a military school for British soldiers. In his few years of service there, young Thomas Fairfax came to know many of the future commanders of the Civil War, on all sides of the conflict. On his arrival he took part in the siege of Bois-le-Duc. However, Horace Vere retired in 1632 after the siege of Maastricht. Fairfax had sufficiently impressed him that the old general gave him his daughter Anne; they were married at Hackney on 20 June 1637. Their daughter Mary was born the next year on 30 July.

==Bishops Wars==
In 1639, he commanded a troop of Yorkshire dragoons which marched with King Charles I against the Scots in the First Bishops&#x27; War, which ended with the Pacification of Berwick before any fighting took place. In the Second Bishops&#x27; War the following year, the English army was routed at the Battle of Newburn. Fairfax fled with the rest of the defeated army, but was nevertheless knighted in January 1641 for his services.

==Pre-Civil War events==
The Fairfaxes, father and son, though serving at first under King Charles I, were opposed to the arbitrary prerogative of the Crown, and Sir Thomas declared that &quot;his judgment was for the Parliament as the king and kingdom&#x27;s great and safest council&quot;. Charles endeavoured to raise a guard for his own person at York, intending it, as the events afterwards would prove, to form the nucleus of an army. Fairfax was employed to present a petition to his sovereign, entreating him to listen to the voice of his parliament, and to discontinue the raising of troops. This was at a great meeting of the freeholders and farmers of Yorkshire convened by the king on Heworth Moor near York. Charles attempted to ignore the petition, pressing his horse forward, but Fairfax followed him and placed the petition on the pommel of the king&#x27;s saddle.

==Civil War==
When the civil war began in 1642, his father, Lord Fairfax, was appointed general of the Parliamentary forces in the north, and Sir Thomas was then made lieutenant-general of the horse under him. Both father and son distinguished themselves in the Yorkshire campaigns.

In 1643, a minor battle between Royalists for Charles I and a small group of Roundheads under Fairfax, who were en route from Tadcaster to Leeds, took place at Seacroft. Fairfax was obliged to retreat across Bramham moor, and summed up the Battle of Seacroft Moor as &#x27;the greatest loss we ever received&#x27;.

Sometimes severely defeated, but more often successful, and always energetic, prudent and resourceful, father and son contrived to keep up the struggle until the crisis of 1644, when York was held by the Marquess of Newcastle against the combined besieging forces of the English Parliamentarians and the Scottish Covenanters, while Prince Rupert hastened with all available forces to the relief of the besieged garrison. A gathering of eager national forces within a few square miles of ground naturally led to a battle, and Marston Moor (2 July 1644) proved decisive for the struggle in the north. The younger Fairfax bore himself with the greatest gallantry in the battle and, though severely wounded, managed to join Oliver Cromwell and the victorious cavalry on the other wing. One of his brothers, Colonel Charles Fairfax, was killed in action. But the Marquess of Newcastle fled the kingdom, and the Royalists abandoned all hope of retrieving their affairs. The city of York was taken, and nearly the whole of the north would submit to the Parliament.

In the West, South and South West of England, however, the Royalist cause remained strong. The war had lasted two years, and the nation began to complain of the contributions that were exacted of and the excesses that were committed by the military. Dissatisfaction was expressed with the military commanders and, as a preliminary step to reform, the Self-denying Ordinance was passed. This involved the removal of the Earl of Essex from the supreme command, along with other Members of Parliament. This was then followed by the New Model Ordinance, which replaced the locally raised Parliamentary regiments with a unified army. Sir Thomas Fairfax was selected as the new Lord General, with Cromwell as his Lieutenant-General and cavalry commander. After a short preliminary campaign, the New Model Army justified its existence, and &quot;the rebels&#x27; new brutish general&quot;, as the king had called him, proved his capacity as commander-in-chief in the decisive Battle of Naseby (14 June 1645). The king fled to Wales. Fairfax besieged Leicester, and was successful at Taunton, Bridgwater and Bristol. The whole of the west was soon reduced.
Fairfax arrived in London on 12 November 1645. In his progress towards the capital he was accompanied by applauding crowds. Complimentary speeches and thanks were presented to him by both houses of parliament, along with a jewel of great value set with diamonds, and a sum of money. The king had returned from Wales and established himself at Oxford, where there was a strong garrison but, ever vacillating, he withdrew secretly, and proceeded to Newark to throw himself into the arms of the Scots Covenanter army there. Oxford capitulated in June 1646 following the final siege, and by the end of September 1646 Charles had neither army nor garrison in England, following the surrender of Thomas Blagge at Wallingford Castle after a siege conducted by Fairfax. In January 1647, the King was delivered up by the Covenanters to the commissioners of England&#x27;s parliament. Fairfax met the king beyond Nottingham, accompanying him during the journey to Holdenby, treating him with the utmost consideration in every way. &quot;The general&quot;, said Charles, &quot;is a man of honour, and keeps his word which he had pledged to me.&quot;

With the collapse of the Royalist cause came a confused period of negotiations between the Parliament and the King, between the King and the Scots, and between the Presbyterians and the Independents in and out of Parliament. In these negotiations the New Model Army soon began to take a most active part. The Lord General was placed in the unpleasant position of intermediary between his own officers and Parliament. In July the person of the King was seized by Cornet Joyce, a subaltern of cavalry—an act which sufficiently demonstrated the hopelessness of controlling the army by its Articles of War.
Fairfax was more at home in the field than at the head of a political committee, and, finding events too strong for him and that his officers were rallying around the more radical and politically shrewd Cromwell, he sought to resign his commission as commander-in-chief. He was, however, persuaded to retain it. He thus remained the titular chief of the army party, and with the greater part of its objects he was in complete, sometimes most active, sympathy. Shortly before the outbreak of the Second Civil War, Fairfax succeeded his father in the barony and in the office of governor of Hull. In the field against the English Royalists in 1648 he displayed his former energy and skill, and his operations culminated in the successful siege of Colchester, after the surrender of which place he approved the execution of the Royalist leaders Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, holding that these officers had broken their parole. At the same time, Cromwell&#x27;s great victory of Preston crushed the faction of the Scots Covenanters who had made an engagement with the king, the Engagers.

John Milton, in a sonnet written during the siege of Colchester, called upon the Lord General to settle the kingdom, but the crisis was now at hand. Fairfax was in agreement with Cromwell and the army leaders in demanding the punishment of Charles, and he was still the effective head of the army. He approved, if he did not take an active part in, Pride&#x27;s Purge (6 December 1648), but on the last and gravest of the questions at issue he set himself in deliberate and open opposition to the policy of the officers. He was placed at the head of the judges who were to try the King, and attended the preliminary sitting of the court, but absented himself after this. The most likely explanation is that when he saw that they were serious about intending to execute the king he declined to have anything to do with this.

In calling over the court, when the crier pronounced the name of Fairfax, it is said that his wife, Anne Fairfax, shouted from the gallery that &quot;he had more wit than to be there&quot;. Later when the court said that they were acting for &quot;all the good people of England&quot;, she shouted &quot;No, nor the hundredth part of them!&quot;. This resulted in an investigation and Anne was asked or required to leave the court. It was said that Anne could not forbear, as Bulstrode Whitelocke says, to exclaim aloud against the proceedings of the High Court of Justice. In February 1649 Fairfax was elected Member of Parliament for Cirencester in the Rump Parliament. Anne was later approached to intercede on the King&#x27;s behalf to prevent his execution.

Fairfax&#x27;s last service as Commander-in-chief was the suppression of the Leveller mutiny at Burford in May 1649. He had given his adhesion to the new order of things, and had been reappointed Lord General, but he merely administered the affairs of the army; when in 1650 Scots Covenanter Kirk Party eventually declared for Charles II, and the Council of State resolved to send an army to Scotland in order to prevent an invasion of England, Fairfax resigned his commission. Cromwell desired to see him continue as Commander-in-chief, as did those planning the war, but Fairfax could not support the war. Cromwell was appointed his successor, &quot;Captain-general and Commander-in-chief of all the forces raised or to be raised at authority of Parliament within the Commonwealth of England.&quot;

==Interregnum ==

During the Commonwealth of England in 1654, Fairfax was elected MP for the newly created constituency of West Riding in the First Protectorate Parliament. He received a pension of £5,000 a year, and lived in retirement at his Yorkshire home of Nunappleton until after the death of the Lord Protector in 1658. Nunappleton and Fairfax&#x27;s retirement there, as well as his personality, are the subject of Andrew Marvell&#x27;s country house poem, &quot;Upon Appleton House&quot;. The troubles of the later Commonwealth recalled Lord Fairfax to political activity, and in 1659 he was elected MP for Yorkshire in the Third Protectorate Parliament.

==Restoration ==
For the last time Fairfax&#x27;s appearance in arms helped to shape the future of the country, when George Monck invited him to assist in the operations about to be undertaken against John Lambert&#x27;s army. In December 1659 he appeared at the head of a body of Yorkshire gentlemen, and such was the influence of Fairfax&#x27;s name and reputation that 1,200 horse quit Lambert&#x27;s colours and joined him. This was speedily followed by the breaking up of all Lambert&#x27;s forces, and that day secured the restoration of the monarchy. For these actions, along with his honourable conduct in the civil war, he was spared from the wave of Royalist retributions. In April 1660 Fairfax was re-elected MP for Yorkshire in the Convention Parliament. He was put at the head of the commission appointed by the House of Commons to wait upon Charles II at The Hague and urge his speedy return. His actions assisted the Stuart Restoration. Fairfax provided the horse which Charles rode at his coronation.

==Later life==
The remaining eleven years of the life of Lord Fairfax were spent in retirement at his seat in Yorkshire. His wife died in 1665 and Fairfax died at Nun Appleton Priory in 1671. He was buried at St James&#x27; Church, Bilbrough, near York.

==Writings==
Fairfax had a taste for literature. He translated some of the Psalms, and wrote poems on solitude, the Christian warfare, the shortness of life, etc. During the last year or two of his life he wrote two Memorials which have been published—one on the northern actions in which he was engaged in 1642–44, and the other on some events in his tenure of the chief command. At York and at Oxford he endeavoured to save the libraries from pillage, and he enriched the Bodleian with some valuable manuscripts. His correspondence was edited by G.W. Johnson and published in 1848–49 in four volumes.

The metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell wrote &quot;Upon Appleton House, To My Lord Fairfax&quot;, nominally about Fairfax&#x27;s home, but also his character as well as England during his era.

==Family==

Fairfax married Hon. Anne de Vere, daughter of Horace Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury and Mary Tracy, on 20 June 1637. They had a daughter, Hon. Mary Fairfax (30 July 163820 October 1704), who married George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham.

Fairfax was succeeded as Lord Fairfax by a cousin, Henry Fairfax, 4th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.

==Analysis==
As a soldier he was exact and methodical in planning, in the heat of battle &quot;so highly transported that scarce any one durst speak a word to him&quot;, chivalrous and punctilious in his dealings with his own men and the enemy. Honour and conscientiousness were equally the characteristics of his private and public character. But his modesty and distrust of his powers made him less effectual as a than as a soldier, and above all he is placed at a disadvantage by being both in war and peace overshadowed by his associate Cromwell, who was politically talented and able to manipulate public antipathy against Charles to lead to his execution, something Fairfax never wanted.

==In fiction==
Fairfax, played by actor Dougray Scott, is a pivotal character in the 2003 film &quot;To Kill a King&quot;, as well as in Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1953 historical fiction &quot;Simon&quot;, being portrayed as inspiring and fair. He also appears as a central character in Sutcliff&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Rider of the White Horse&quot;, which gives an account of the early stage of the Civil War from the point of view of his wife, and in Howard Brenton&#x27;s 2012 play &quot;55 Days&quot;. Douglas Wilmer portrayed him in the 1970 Ken Hughes film &quot;Cromwell&quot;.

He was played by Jerome Willis in the 1975 historical film &quot;Winstanley&quot;. He appears in Michael Arnold&#x27;s novel &quot;Marston Moor&quot;, which includes an account of Fairfax&#x27;s adventures in the eponymous battle. He was also a central character, played by Nigel Anthony, in the 1988 BBC Radio production of Don Taylor&#x27;s play &quot;God&#x27;s Revolution&quot;.

<doc id="193474" wikidata="Q5208898" url="?curid=193474" title="Dahlia 'Moonfire'">
<text>&quot;Dahlia&quot; ″Moonfire″ is a &quot;Dahlia&quot; cultivar with very dark, almost black leaves like &quot;Dahlia&quot; &#x27;Bishop of Llandaff&#x27;. It is classified as Group 10 Miscellaneous. The orange-yellow flower heads are 80 mm wide and sit on stems of up to 85 cm height.

The cultivar was originally developed in The Netherlands, but mistakenly supplied to Bridgmere Nurseries (UK) as an unnamed seedling, where it was named by Chris Sanders. It turned out that the cultivar was grown on Dutch trial grounds under the name &#x27;Sunshine&#x27;. As the International Dahlia Register has three inadequately described cultivars labelled &#x27;Sunshine&#x27;, it was not possible to connect &#x27;Moonfire&#x27; with one of these cultivars.

<text>The Grammy Award for Record of the Year is presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to sales or chart position.&quot; The Record of the Year award is one of the four &quot;General Field&quot; categories at the awards (alongside Best New Artist, Song of the Year and Album of the Year) presented annually since the 1st Annual Grammy Awards in 1959.

Arrangers, songwriters, musicians and background singers of a winning recording can apply for a Winners Certificate. Songwriters can only apply for a certificate if it is a new song.

Since the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013, mastering engineers are considered nominees and award recipients in this category.

Although &quot;&quot; often refers to any recording of music, Record of the Year differs from Song of the Year or Album of the Year:

* Record of the Year is awarded for a single or for one track from an album. This award goes to the performing artist, the producer, recording engineer and/or mixer for that song. In this sense, &quot;record&quot; means a particular recorded song, not its composition or an album of songs.
* Song of the Year is also awarded for a single or individual track, but the recipient of this award is the songwriter who actually wrote the lyrics and/or melodies to the song. &quot;Song&quot; in this context means the song as composed, not its recording.
* Album of the Year is awarded for a whole album, and the award is presented to the artist, songwriter, producer, recording engineer, and mastering engineer for that album. In this context, &quot;album&quot; means a recorded collection of songs (a multi-track LP, CD, or download package), not the individual songs or their compositions.

==History and description==
The Record of the Year awards have been awarded since 1959. It is one of the four most prestigious Grammy Awards. Despite both the Song of the Year award and Record of the Year being awarded for a single or for one track from an album, this award goes to the performer and production team of the song whereas the Song of the Year award goes only to the composer(s) of the song. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide, the award is given for commercially released singles or tracks of new vocal or instrumental recordings. Tracks from a previous year&#x27;s album may be entered provided the track was not entered the previous year and provided the album did not win a Grammy Award to the artist(s), producer(s), recording engineer(s) and/or mixer(s) if other than the artist. Associate producers and executive producers are not eligible&quot;.

The honorees through its history have been:
*1959–1965: Artist only.
*1966–1998: Artist and producer.
*1999–2012: Artist, producer, recording engineer and mixing engineer
*2013–present: Artist, producer, recording engineer, mixing engineer and mastering engineer

The category has expanded to include eight nominees in 2019.

== Achievements ==

Tom Coyne holds the record for most wins in this category as a mastering engineer at four times (2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018) and was the only person to win the award four consecutive years. Only two artists have won three times: Paul Simon (&quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; in 1969, &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; in 1971, both as part of Simon &amp; Garfunkel; and &quot;Graceland&quot; in 1988) and Bruno Mars (&quot;Uptown Funk&quot; in 2016, with Mark Ronson; &quot;24K Magic&quot; in 2018; and &quot;Leave the Door Open&quot; in 2022, as part of Silk Sonic). Four engineers/mixers have won the award three times Tom Elmhirst has won three times as an engineer/mixer (2008, 2012 and 2017), Şerban Ghenea (2016, 2018 and 2022), John Hanes (2016, 2018 and 2022), and Charles Moniz (2016, 2018 and 2022)

Roberta Flack was the first artist to win Record of the Year in two consecutive years: in 1973 (&quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;) and 1974 (&quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;) from two different studio albums. This happened again when U2 won in 2001 (&quot;Beautiful Day&quot;) and 2002 (&quot;Walk On&quot;), the only occurrence of an artist winning the award in two consecutive years with records from the same album. Billie Eilish became the first musician ever to complete the feat with recordings from a studio album, as well as a non-album single: in 2020 (&quot;Bad Guy&quot;) and 2021 (&quot;Everything I Wanted&quot;).

Other artists to receive multiple Grammys for Record of the Year are Henry Mancini (&quot;Moon River&quot; and &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;); Simon &amp; Garfunkel (&quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;); The 5th Dimension (&quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; and &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;); Eric Clapton (&quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Change the World&quot;); Norah Jones (&quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot; and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;); Adele (&quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;).

Mark Ronson is the only performer to win the award both as the main credit artist and as a record producer, winning as lead artist for his respective song, &quot;Uptown Funk&quot; (featuring Bruno Mars); and as a producer for &quot;Rehab&quot; by Amy Winehouse.

Beyoncé is the most nominated artist for Record of the Year with nine nominations. Beyoncé also has the most Record of the Year nominations among female artists with nods for &quot;Say My Name&quot; as part of Destiny&#x27;s Child and seven times as a solo act with &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; (featuring Jay-Z), &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Formation&quot;, &quot;Black Parade&quot;, &quot;Savage&quot; (with Megan Thee Stallion), &quot;Break My Soul&quot; and &quot;Texas Hold &#x27;Em&quot;; however, she is yet to win one. Frank Sinatra holds the record for most nominations as a male artist with nominations for &quot;Witchcraft&quot;, &quot;High Hopes&quot;, &quot;Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Easy&quot;, &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;, &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot; (with Nancy Sinatra), and &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;&quot;; he received this accolade once in 1967, with &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. The Beatles have the most Record of the Year nominations as a group, with five nominations: &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Now and Then&quot;; but never won the award.

The first woman to win the award was Astrud Gilberto in 1965, for &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; (with Stan Getz). Roberta Flack was the first female artist to win the award twice. Flack, Norah Jones, Adele, and Billie Eilish are the only women to win the award more than once for their recordings, winning for &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; and &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot; and &quot;Here We Go Again&quot; (with Ray Charles); and &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;; and &quot;Bad Guy&quot; and &quot;Everything I Wanted&quot;, respectively (Flack was also nominated for &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;; Adele nominated for &quot;Chasing Pavements&quot; and &quot;Easy on Me&quot;; and Eilish nominated for &quot;Happier Than Ever&quot;, &quot;What Was I Made For?&quot; and &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;). Additionally, both Florence LaRue and Marilyn McCoo also receive this accolade twice as part of The 5th Dimension, for &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot; and &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;.

At 17 years old, Lorde became the youngest main artist to be nominated for &quot;Royals&quot; in 2014, with Billie Eilish becoming the youngest winner at 18 years old for &quot;Bad Guy&quot; in 2020.

Christopher Cross and Billie Eilish are the only artists to receive Grammys for Record of the Year as well as Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist in a single ceremony. Adele was the first artist to win the awards for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist on separate occasions. Only seven artists took the Record of the Year and Best New Artist awards during the same ceremony: Bobby Darin (&quot;Mack the Knife&quot; in 1960), Christopher Cross (&quot;Sailing&quot; in 1981), Sheryl Crow (&quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; in 1995), Norah Jones (&quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot; in 2003), Amy Winehouse (&quot;Rehab&quot; in 2008), Sam Smith (&quot;Stay with Me (Darkchild Version)&quot; in 2015) and Billie Eilish (&quot;Bad Guy&quot; in 2020).

Frank Sinatra holds the record for most consecutive years being nominated for Record of the Year, with four. Additionally, Roberta Flack, Steve Winwood, Post Malone, Billie Eilish, and Doja Cat are the only artists to receive three consecutive nominations for Record of the Year. 

The person to appear on the most consecutive Records of the Year was Hal Blaine, the prolific studio drummer who played on six consecutive winners from 1966 to 1971: &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;, &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;, and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;.

Thirty-two of the winning songs have also won the award for Song of the Year.

==Process==
From 1995 to 2021, members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences nominated their choices for record of the year. A list of the top twenty records was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who then selected the top five records to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot. The rest of the members then voted on a winner from the five nominees. In 2018, it was announced the number of nominated tracks will be increased to eight. In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for record of the year would be decided by votes from members. Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10. However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. This allowed &quot;Montero (Call Me by Your Name)&quot; by Lil Nas X and &quot;I Still Have Faith in You&quot; by ABBA to be nominated as they were the records that received the most votes besides the other eight nominees. As of the 2024 ceremony, the number of nominees has been reduced back to eight.

<doc id="193486" wikidata="Q152690" url="?curid=193486" title="Maeve Binchy">
<text>Anne Maeve Binchy Snell (28 May 1939 – 30 July 2012) was an Irish novelist, playwright, short story writer, columnist, and speaker. Her novels were characterised by a sympathetic and often humorous portrayal of small-town life in Ireland, and surprise endings. Her novels, which were translated into 37 languages, sold more than 40 million copies worldwide. Her death at age 73, announced by Vincent Browne on Irish television late on 30 July 2012, was mourned as the death of one of Ireland&#x27;s best-loved and most recognisable writers.

She appeared in the US market, featuring on &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Best Seller list&quot; and in Oprah&#x27;s Book Club. Recognised for her &quot;total absence of malice&quot; and generosity to other writers, she finished third in a 2000 poll for World Book Day, ahead of Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Stephen King.

==Biography==

===Overview===

====Early life and family====
Anne Maeve Binchy was born on 28 May 1939 in Dalkey, Dublin, the oldest of the four children of William and Maureen (née Blackmore) Binchy. Her siblings include one brother, William Binchy, Regius Professor of Laws at Trinity College Dublin, and two sisters: Irene &quot;Renie&quot; (who predeceased Binchy), and Joan, Mrs. Ryan. Her uncle was the historian D. A. Binchy (1899–1989). Educated at St Anne&#x27;s (then located at No 35 Clarinda Park East), Dún Laoghaire, and later at Holy Child Killiney, she went on to study at University College Dublin (where she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history). She worked as a teacher of French, Latin, and history at various girls&#x27; schools, then as a journalist at &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and later became a writer of novels, short stories, and dramatic works.

In 1968, her mother died of cancer at age 57. After Binchy&#x27;s father died in 1971, she sold the family house and moved to a bedsit in Dublin.

====Israel/Faith====
Her parents were Catholics, and Binchy attended a convent school. However, a trip to Israel profoundly affected both her career and her faith. She later said to &quot;Vulture&quot;:
In 1963, I worked in a Jewish school in Dublin, teaching French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and worked in a kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was going out to the Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It&#x27;s not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.

One Sunday, attempting to locate where the Last Supper is supposed to have occurred, she climbed a mountainside to a cavern guarded by a Brooklyn-born Israeli soldier. She wept with despair. The soldier asked, &quot;What&#x27;ya expect, ma&#x27;am – a Renaissance table set for 13?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes! That&#x27;s just what I did expect&quot;. This experience caused her to renounce her Catholic faith, and eventually become agnostic.

====Marriage====
Binchy, described as &quot;six feet tall, rather stout, and garrulous&quot;, although she actually grew to 6&#x27;1&quot;, said in an interview with Gay Byrne of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; that, growing up in Dalkey, she never felt herself to be attractive; &quot;as a plump girl I didn&#x27;t start on an even footing to everyone else&quot;. After her mother&#x27;s death, she expected to lead a life of spinsterhood, saying &quot;I expected I would live at home, as I always did.&quot; She continued, &quot;I felt very lonely, the others all had a love waiting for them and I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

However, when recording a piece for &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; in London she met children&#x27;s author Gordon Snell, then a freelance producer with the BBC. Their friendship blossomed into a cross-border romance, with her in Ireland and him in London, until she eventually secured a job in London through &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. She and Snell married in 1977 and, after living in London for a time, moved to Ireland. They lived together in Dalkey, not far from where she had grown up, until Binchy&#x27;s death. She described her husband as a &quot;writer, a man I loved and he loved me and we got married and it was great and is still great. He believed I could do anything, just as my parents had believed all those years ago, and I started to write fiction and that took off fine. And he loved Ireland, and the fax was invented so we writers could live anywhere we liked, instead of living in London near publishers.

====Letter to the president====
Files in Ireland&#x27;s National Archives, released to the public in 2006, feature a request from Maeve Binchy to President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh asking if he could &quot;receive&quot; her. She wrote, &quot;I know you are extremely busy but I often see in the paper that you &#x27;received&#x27; so-and-so and was wondering very simply could I be received too.&quot; This request came while she was working for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in London in 1975.

===Health===
In 2002, Binchy suffered health problems related to a heart condition, which inspired her to write &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;. The book, about what Binchy terms &quot;a heart failure clinic&quot; in Dublin and the people involved with it, reflects many of her own experiences and observations in the hospital. Towards the end of her life, Binchy&#x27;s website stated &quot;My health isn&#x27;t so good these days and I can&#x27;t travel around to meet people the way I used to. But I&#x27;m always delighted to hear from readers, even if it takes me a while to reply.&quot;

==Death==
Binchy died on 30 July 2012. She was 73 and had suffered from various maladies, including painful osteoarthritis. As a result of the arthritis she had a hip operation. A month before her death she suffered a severe spinal infection (acute discitis), and she finally succumbed to a heart attack. Gordon was by her side when she died in a Dublin hospital. Just ahead of that evening&#x27;s &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot; and TV3&#x27;s late evening news, Vincent Browne and then Alan Cantwell, who respectively anchor these shows, announced to Irish television viewers that Binchy had died earlier that evening.

Immediate media reports described Binchy as &quot;beloved&quot;, &quot;Ireland&#x27;s most well-known novelist&quot; and the &quot;best-loved writer of her generation&quot;. Fellow writers mourned their loss, including Ian Rankin, Jilly Cooper, Anne Rice, and Jeffrey Archer. Politicians also paid tribute. President Michael D. Higgins stated: &quot;Our country mourns.&quot; Taoiseach Enda Kenny said, &quot;Today we have lost a national treasure.&quot; Minister of State at the Department of Health Kathleen Lynch, appearing as a guest on &quot;Tonight with Vincent Browne&quot;, said Binchy was, for her [Lynch&#x27;s] money, as worthy an Irish writer as James Joyce or Oscar Wilde, and praised her for selling so many more books than they managed.

In the days after her death, tributes were published from such writers as John Banville, Roddy Doyle, and Colm Tóibín. Banville contrasted Binchy with Gore Vidal, who died the day after her, observing that Vidal &quot;used to say that it was not enough for him to succeed, but others must fail. Maeve wanted everyone to be a success.&quot; Numerous tributes appeared in publications on both sides of the Atlantic, including &quot;The Guardian&quot; and CBC News.

Shortly before her death, Binchy told &quot;The Irish Times&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t have any regrets about any roads I didn&#x27;t take. Everything went well, and I think that&#x27;s been a help because I can look back, and I do get great pleasure out of looking back ... I&#x27;ve been very lucky and I have a happy old age with good family and friends still around.&quot; Just before dying, she read her latest short story at the Dalkey Book Festival. She once said she would like to die &quot;... on my 100th birthday, piloting Gordon and myself into the side of a mountain&quot;.

Despite being agnostic, Binchy was given a traditional Requiem Mass which took place at the Church of the Assumption, in her hometown of Dalkey. She was later cremated at Mount Jerome Cemetery and Crematorium.

==Work==

===Journalism===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reports: Binchy&#x27;s &quot;writing career began by accident in the early 1960s, after she spent time on a kibbutz in Israel. Her father was so taken with her letters home that &quot;he cut off the &#x27;Dear Daddy&#x27; bits,&quot; Ms. Binchy later recounted, and sent them to an Irish newspaper, which published them.&quot; Donal Lynch observed of her first paying journalism role: the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; &quot;was impressed enough to commission her, paying her £16, which was then a week-and-a-half&#x27;s salary for her.&quot;
In 1968, Binchy joined the staff at &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and worked there as a writer, columnist, the first Women&#x27;s Page editor then the London editor, later reporting for the paper from London before returning to Ireland.

Binchy&#x27;s first published book is a compilation of her newspaper articles titled &quot;My First Book&quot;. Published in 1970, it is now out of print. As Binchy&#x27;s bio posted at Read Ireland describes: &quot;The Dublin section of the book contains insightful case histories that prefigure her novelist&#x27;s interest in character. The rest of the book is mainly humorous, and particularly droll is her account of a skiing holiday, &#x27;I Was a Winter Sport.&#x27;&quot;

===Literature===
In all, Binchy published 16 novels, four short-story collections, a play, and a novella. A 17th novel, &quot;A Week in Winter&quot;, was published posthumously. Her literary career began with two books of short stories: &quot;Central Line&quot; (1978) and &quot;Victoria Line&quot; (1980). She published her debut novel &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; in 1982. In 1983, it sold for the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy and her husband were two months behind with the mortgage at the time. However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as fast as she could talk – ultimately became one of Ireland&#x27;s richest women.

Her first book was rejected five times. She would later describe these rejections as &quot;a slap in the face [...] It&#x27;s like if you don&#x27;t go to a dance you can never be rejected but you&#x27;ll never get to dance either&quot;.

Most of Binchy&#x27;s stories are set in Ireland, dealing with the tensions between urban and rural life, the contrasts between England and Ireland, and the dramatic changes in Ireland between World War II and the present day. Her books have been translated into 37 languages.

While some of Binchy&#x27;s novels are complete stories (&quot;Circle of Friends&quot;, &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot;), many others revolve around a cast of interrelated characters (&quot;The Copper Beech&quot;, &quot;Silver Wedding&quot;, &quot;The Lilac Bus&quot;, &quot;Evening Class&quot;, and &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;). Her later novels, &quot;Evening Class&quot;, &quot;Scarlet Feather&quot;, &quot;Quentins&quot;, and &quot;Tara Road&quot;, feature a cast of recurring characters.

Binchy announced in 2000 that she would not tour any more of her novels, but would instead be devoting her time to other activities and to her husband, Gordon Snell. Five further novels were published before her death: &quot;Quentins&quot; (2002), &quot;Nights of Rain and Stars&quot; (2004), &quot;Whitethorn Woods&quot; (2006), &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; (2008), and &quot;Minding Frankie&quot; (2010). Her final novel, &quot;A Week in Winter&quot;, was published posthumously in 2012. In 2014 a collection of 36 unpublished short stories that she had written over a period of decades was published under the title &quot;Chestnut Street&quot;.

Binchy wrote several dramas specifically for radio and the silver screen. Additionally, several of her novels and short stories were adapted for radio, film, and television. (See List of Works: Films, radio and television.)

==Public appearances==
Binchy appeared on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; on Saturday 20 March (based on chronology, this would have been 1982) in connection with the publication of the &quot;Dublin 4&quot; short story collection. &quot;Then the conversation broadened and Gay Byrne asked about some aspects of my work, the royal weddings&quot;, Binchy later recalled in a letter she sent to the programme. &quot;I said how much I had liked Charles&#x27;s wedding and hated Anne&#x27;s – about covering the election in Ireland and how I had been one of the very few journalists watching FitzGerald and Haughey on the night of the Great Debate...&quot;

Following the publication of &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot;, the programme sought Binchy to reappear to explain her success. In advance of her appearance she sent Mary O&#x27;Sullivan, who was working on the programme, a letter (the same one referred to above) setting out her earnings in some detail, since Binchy thought this would be of relevance. She received an initial 5,000 Irish pounds for &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot;. The paperback rights were sold for a British record for a first novel with a prepublication advance of £52,000 from Coronet. Viking Press paid Binchy $200,000 for the U.S. hardcover edition. The Literary Guild of America paid a further $50,000. The French publisher paid Binchy 50,000 francs. Binchy wrote to O&#x27;Sullivan, &quot;I thought it would be better if you knew the exact figures, then you could decide what was and what was not relevant&quot;. O&#x27;Sullivan republished the letter in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Living&quot; supplement in 2020 but mentioned that the last page, which followed on from Binchy referring to what she intended to do with all her money, was missing.

In 1994, Binchy appeared on &quot;Morningside&quot; with Peter Gzowski.

In 1999, Binchy appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. In 2009, she appeared on &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, also presented by Gay Byrne. Binchy and her husband had a cameo appearance together in &quot;Fair City&quot; on 14 December 2011, during which the couple dined in The Hungry Pig.

==Awards and honours==
In 1978, Binchy won a Jacob&#x27;s Award for her RTÉ play, &quot;Deeply Regretted By&quot;. A 1993 photograph of her by Richard Whitehead belongs to the collection of the National Portrait Gallery and a painting of her by Maeve McCarthy, commissioned in 2005, is on display in the National Gallery of Ireland.

In 1999, she received the British Book Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2000, she received a People of the Year Award. In 2001, &quot;Scarlet Feather&quot; won the W H Smith Book Award for Fiction, defeating works by Joanna Trollope and then Booker winner Margaret Atwood, amongst other contenders.

In 2007, she received the Irish PEN Award, joining writers including John B. Keane, Brian Friel, Edna O&#x27;Brien, William Trevor, John McGahern and Seamus Heaney.

In 2010, she received a lifetime achievement award from the Irish Book Awards. In 2012, she received an Irish Book Award in the &quot;Irish Popular Fiction Book&quot; category for &quot;A Week in Winter&quot;.

===Posthumous===
There were posthumous proposals to name a new Liffey crossing &quot;Binchy Bridge&quot; in memory of the writer. Ultimately the bridge was named for trade unionist Rosie Hackett.

In September 2012, a new garden behind the Dalkey Library in County Dublin was dedicated in memory of Binchy.

In 2014, University College Dublin announced the first annual Maeve Binchy Travel Award. The €4000 award will help student winners &quot;pursue a novel travel trip to enhance their writing skills&quot;.

====Films====
*&quot;Circle of Friends&quot; (1995 film) – Hollywood film starring Chris O&#x27;Donnell and Minnie Driver, based on Binchy&#x27;s fifth novel, &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; (1990) with a radical change of ending.

In addition, the plot of the Danish film &quot;Italian for Beginners&quot; (2000) was taken in part from Binchy&#x27;s novel &quot;Evening Class&quot; without credit or payment to her; the production company later settled with Binchy for a payment of an undisclosed amount.

====Radio====
Since 1968, Binchy was a &quot;frequent and hugely popular contributor to RTÉ Radio&quot;. A press release dated 31 July 2012 and posted in that organisation&#x27;s online Press Centre reads:

::&quot;RTÉ Radio 1 provided the platform for Maeve&#x27;s many forays into the world of drama. In 2005 RTÉ 2fm DJ Gerry Ryan was among the cast of Surprise, a four-part radio drama written by Maeve. Other radio drama work included the award-winning Infancy and Tia Maria, starring Oscar winner Kathy Bates. Maeve was a driving force behind the RTÉ Radio 1 Human Rights Drama Seasons, while her story The Games Room was adapted for RTÉ Radio 1 by Anne-Marie Casey in 2009.&quot;

<text>Mandaeans (Mandaic: ࡌࡀࡍࡃࡀࡉࡉࡀ) ( ), also known as Mandaean Sabians ( ) or simply as Sabians ( ), are an ethnoreligious group who are followers of Mandaeism. They believe that John the Baptist was the final and most important prophet. They may have been among the earliest religious groups to practice baptism, as well as among the earliest adherents of Gnosticism, a belief system of which they are the last surviving representatives today. The Mandaeans were originally native speakers of Mandaic, an Eastern Aramaic language, before they nearly all switched to Mesopotamian Arabic or Persian as their main language.

After the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies in 2003, the Mandaean community of Iraq, which before the war numbered 60,000–70,000 persons, collapsed due to the rise of Islamic extremism and the absence of protection against it, with most of the community relocating to Iran, Syria and Jordan, or forming diaspora communities beyond the Middle East. Mandaeans have been forcibly converted to Islam, making them apostates from Islam if they revert to their religion, thereby risking being murdered. Such Mandaeans have voiced feeling unsafe in any Muslim country for this reason.

The remaining community of Iranian Mandaeans has also been dwindling as a result of religious persecution over the decades. Unlike other religious minorities such as Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, Mandaeans have no protection from persecution whatsoever, similar to Baháʼís in Iran. By 2007, the population of Mandaeans in Iraq had fallen to approximately 5,000.
There are estimated to be 60,000–100,000 Mandaeans worldwide. About 10,000 Mandaeans live in Australia and between 10,000 and 20,000 in Sweden, making them the countries with the most Mandaeans. There are about 2,500 Mandaeans in Jordan, the largest Mandaean community in the Middle East outside of Iraq and Iran.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Mandaean&quot; comes from the Mandaic word &quot;manda&quot;, meaning &quot;to have knowledge&quot;.

In Muslim countries, Mandaeans are sometimes also called Sabians ( ), a Quranic epithet historically claimed by several religious groups (see also below). The etymology of the Arabic word is disputed. According to one interpretation, it is the active participle of the Arabic root -- (&#x27;to turn to&#x27;), meaning &#x27;converts&#x27;. Another widely cited hypothesis is that it is derived from an Aramaic root meaning &#x27;to baptize&#x27;.

==History==
===Origin===
According to a theory first proposed by Ignatius of Jesus in the 17th century, the Mandaeans originated in Judea and later migrated east to the Mesopotamian Marshes. This theory was gradually abandoned, but was revived in the early 20th century through the first translation of Mandaean texts, which Biblical scholars like Rudolf Bultmann believed capable of shedding new light on the development of early Christianity. However, most New Testament scholars rejected the Judean origin thesis, which by World War II was again largely deserted by scholars. It was revived in the 1960s by Rudolf Macúch; it is now accepted by Mandaean scholars such as Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley and Şinasi Gündüz. According to Macúch, the eastward migration from the Roman province of Judea to southern Iraq took place in the first century CE, while other scholars such as Kurt Rudolph think it probably took place in the third century.

There are also other theories. Kevin van Bladel has argued that the Mandaeans originated in Sasanian-ruled Mesopotamia in the fifth century. According to Carlos Gelbert, Mandaeans formed a vibrant community in Edessa in late antiquity. Brikha Nasoraia, a Mandaean priest and scholar, accepts a two-origin theory in which he considers the contemporary Mandaeans to have descended from both a line of Mandaeans who had originated from the Jordan Valley, as well as another group of Mandaeans (or Gnostics) who were indigenous to southern Mesopotamia. Thus, the historical merging of the two groups gave rise to the Mandaeans of today.

There are several indications of the ultimate origin of the Mandaeans. Early religious concepts and terminologies recur in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and &quot;Yardena&quot; (Jordan) has been the name of every baptismal water in Mandaeism. &quot;Mara ḏ-Rabuta&quot; (Mandaic: &quot;Lord of Greatness&quot;, one of the names for Hayyi Rabbi) is found in the Genesis Apocryphon (1Q20) II, 4. They formally refer to themselves as &quot;Naṣuraiia&quot; (), meaning guardians or possessors of secret rites and knowledge. Another early self-appellation is &quot;bhiria zidqa&quot;, meaning &#x27;elect of righteousness&#x27; or &#x27;the chosen righteous&#x27;, a term found in the Book of Enoch and Genesis Apocryphon II, 4. As Nasoraeans, Mandaeans believe that they constitute the true congregation of &quot;bnia nhura&quot;, meaning &#x27;Sons of Light&#x27;, a term used by the Essenes. The &quot;bit manda&quot; (beth manda) is described as &quot;biniana rba ḏ-šrara&quot; (&quot;the Great building of Truth&quot;) and &quot;bit tušlima&quot; (&quot;house of Perfection&quot;) in Mandaean texts such as the &quot;Qulasta&quot;, &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;, and the &quot;Mandaean Book of John&quot;. The only known literary parallels are in Essene texts from Qumran such as the &quot;Community Rule&quot;, which has similar phrases such as the &quot;house of Perfection and Truth in Israel&quot; (&quot;Community Rule&quot; 1QS VIII 9) and &quot;house of Truth in Israel.&quot; 

The Mandaic language, a Southeastern Aramaic dialect, exhibits significant inherited features from Akkadian (like the Aramaic dialects of the Assyrians), particularly from the Late Babylonian phase. Phonetic, grammatical, and lexicographic elements traceable to Akkadian strongly suggest that the origins of Mandaic and its speakers, the Mandaeans, are deeply rooted in Mesopotamia. While Mandaic has historically been classified alongside Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic, Assyrian neo-Aramaic and Syriac as part of Eastern Aramaic, recent linguistic analysis has led to the recognition of a distinct Southeastern Aramaic branch. This classification is based on clear isoglosses in phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicography that separate the Mandaic language.

The roots of the Mandaic language extend back to the early Parthian period, with no compelling evidence of Western Aramaic linguistic influence in Mandaic or the Aramaic of the Assyrians. The Mandaeans are thought to descend from an Assyro-Babylonian population, further reinforcing the connection between Mandaic and its Mesopotamian heritage. This distinction highlights the uniqueness of Mandaic within the broader Aramaic linguistic landscape. Although there appears to be strong religious connections between the Mandaeans with both ancient Assyro-Babylonian beliefs and Gnostic Jewish sects, such as the Elcasaites, linguistically the Mandaeans speak what can be considered a pure form of Babylonian Aramaic.

A priest holds the title of Rabbi and a place of worship is called a &quot;Mashkhanna&quot;. According to Mandaean sources such as the Haran Gawaita, the &quot;Nasuraiia&quot; inhabited the areas around Jerusalem and the River Jordan in the 1st century CE. There is archaeological evidence that attests to the Mandaean presence in pre-Islamic Iraq. Scholars, including Kurt Rudolph, connect the early Mandaeans with the Jewish sect of the Nasoraeans. Mandaeans believe that their religion predates Judaism. According to Mandaean scripture, the Mandaeans descend directly from Shem, Noah&#x27;s son, in Mesopotamia and also from John the Baptist&#x27;s original Nasoraean Mandaean disciples in Jerusalem. According to the Mandaean Society in America, Mani (the founder of Manichaeism) was influenced by the Mandaeans, and a pre-Manichaean presence of the Mandaean religion is more than likely.
Gerard Russell quotes Rishama Sattar Jabbar Hilo, &quot;Ours is the oldest religion in the world. It dates back to Adam.&quot; Russell adds, &quot;He [Rishama Sattar Jabbar Hilo] traced its history back to Babylon, though he said it might have some connection to the Jews of Jerusalem.&quot; The Mandaean Synod of Australia led by Rishama Salah Choheili states:
===Parthian and Sasanian period===

A number of ancient Aramaic inscriptions dating back to the 2nd century CE were uncovered in Elymais. Although the letters appear quite similar to the Mandaean ones, it is impossible to know whether the inhabitants of Elymais were Mandaeans. Rudolf Macúch believes Mandaean letters predate Elymaic ones. Under Parthian and early Sasanian rule, foreign religions were tolerated and Mandaeans appear to have enjoyed royal protection. The situation changed by the ascension of Bahram I in 273, who under the influence of the zealous Zoroastrian high priest Kartir persecuted all non-Zoroastrian religions. It is thought that this persecution encouraged the consolidation of Mandaean religious literature.
The persecutions instigated by Kartir seems to temporarily erase Mandaeans from recorded history. Their presence, however can still be found in Mandaean magical bowls and lead strips which were produced from the 3rd to the 7th century.

===Islamic period===
The Mandaeans re-emerged at the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in , when their leader, Anush bar Danqa, is said to have appeared before the Muslim authorities, showing them a copy of the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;, the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be John the Baptist, who is also mentioned in the Quran by the name Yahya ibn Zakariya. Consequently, the Muslim caliph provided them acknowledgement as People of the Book (, adherents of religions recognized as guided by previous revelations). However, this account is likely apocryphal: since it mentions that Anush bar Danqa traveled to Baghdad, it must have occurred after the founding of Baghdad in 762, if it took place at all.

Mandaeans appear to have flourished during the early Islamic period, as attested by the voluminous expansion of Mandaic literature and canons. Tib near Wasit is particularly noted as an important scribal center. Yaqut al-Hamawi describes Tib as a town inhabited by &#x27;Nabatean&#x27; (i.e. Aramaic speaking) &#x27;Sabians&#x27; (see below) who consider themselves to be descendants of Seth.

The status of the Mandaeans was questioned by the Abbasid caliph al-Qahir Billah (899–950 CE), even though they had received recognition as People of the Book. To avoid further investigation by the authorities, the Mandaeans paid a bribe of 50,000 dinars and were left alone. It appeared that the Mandaeans were even exempt from paying the Jizya, otherwise imposed upon non-Muslims.

It has been suggested by some scholars that Harranian intellectuals who worked at the Abbasid court such as Thābit ibn Qurra may have been Mandaeans, though most scholars believe they were adherents of the pagan astral religion of Harran.

===Early modern period===
Early contact with Europeans came about in the mid-16th century, when Portuguese missionaries encountered Mandaeans in Southern Iraq and controversially designated them &quot;Christians of St. John&quot;. In the next centuries Europeans became more acquainted with the Mandaeans and their religion.

The Mandaeans suffered persecution under the Qajar rule in the 1780s. The dwindling community was threatened with complete annihilation, when a cholera epidemic broke out in Shushtar and half of its inhabitants died. The entire Mandaean priesthood perished and Mandaeism was restored due to the efforts of few learned men such as Yahya Bihram. Another danger threatened the community in 1870, when the local governor of Shushtar massacred the Mandaeans against the will of the Shah.
=== Modern Iraq and Iran ===

Following the First World War, the Mandaeans were still largely living in rural areas in the lower parts of British protected Iraq and Iran. Owing to the rise of Arab nationalism, Iraqi Mandaeans seen the increase use of Arabic, with Mandaic being dropped as a language by the Mandaeans, with the rise of secularism in Iraq, more Mandaeans aimed to follow the secular way of life, with a lot of Iraqi Mandaeans abandoning daily baptisms, instead weekly ones, and for some monthly. By the 70s to 80s the Mandaeans were also forced to abandon their stances on the cutting of hair and forced military service, which are strictly prohibited in Mandaeaism. 

Mandeans, who mostly lived in rural parts of Maysan Governorate, migrated to large cities such as Baghdad and Basra. This caused a major change in the community, as they transitioned from traditionalism to modernism. The future generation entered the world of politics. Some of them became leaders in the Communist Party. Some of them entered the Baath Party and the rest of the parties. During the time of Abdul Karim Qasim persecution decreased. Later under Saddam Hussein, the Mandaean community flourished in Iraq. They were given permission to practice their religion and the government allocated them lands to build their places of worship. A decree was issued in 1972, allowing Mandeans to have holiday and enjoy during their festivals.

In Iraq, Mandaeans were renowned goldsmiths and silversmiths, particularly in Baghdad, where they operated shops in Al-Nahr Street, Shorjah, Qishla, Rusafa, Al-Karimat, Al-Azramli, and Al-Fahhama on the Al-Karkh side. Many Mandaeans also held prominent positions in the government. Lamia Abbas Amara served as Iraq’s cultural attaché and deputy permanent representative to UNESCO in Paris from 1973 to 1975. Poet Abdul Razzaq Abdul was a cultural advisor to the Ministry of Culture and Information, while astronomer Abdul Azim Al-Sabti played a key role in establishing the Erbil Observatory on Mount Korek, the largest observatory in the Middle East. In 2001, Saddam granted them the title of &quot;Golden Sect&quot;. He pledged to build more Mandaean temples. Rishama Sattar Jabbar Hilow met Saddam in 2001, an event televised in Iraq. The Sabian–Mandaean Mandi in Baghdad was built on the land donated by the government.

According to local sources, their population until 2003 was 75,000. The 2003 American invasion of Iraq and the war that followed brought more troubles to Mandaeans, as the security situation deteriorated. Many members of the Mandaean community, who were known as goldsmiths, were targeted by criminal gangs for ransoms. The rise of ISIS forced thousands to flee the country, after they were given the choice of conversion or death. It is estimated that around 90% of Iraqi Mandaeans were either killed or have fled after the U.S. led invasion.

The Mandaeans of Iran lived chiefly in Ahvaz, Iranian Khuzestan, but have moved as a result of the Iran–Iraq War to other cities such as Tehran, Karaj and Shiraz. The Mandaeans, who were traditionally considered as People of the Book (members of a protected religion under Islamic rule), lost this status after the Iranian Revolution. However, despite this, Mandaeans still maintain successful businesses and factories in areas such as Ahwaz. In April 1996, the cause of the Mandaeans&#x27; religious status in the Islamic Republic was raised. The parliament came to the conclusion that Mandaeans were included in the protected status of People of the Book alongside Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians and specified that, from a legal viewpoint, there is no prohibition against Muslims associating with Mandaeans, whom the parliament identified as being the Sabians mentioned explicitly in the Quran. That same year, Ayatollah Sajjadi of Al-Zahra University in Qom posed three questions regarding the Mandaeans&#x27; beliefs and seemed satisfied with the answers. These rulings, however, did not lead to Mandaeans regaining their more officially recognized status as People of the Book. In 2009, Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwā recognizing the Mandaeans as People of the Book.

:&quot;Further information (in Arabic): Mandaeans in Iraq&quot;

Prior to the Iraq War, the Iraqi Mandaean community was centered in southern Iraq in cities such as Nasiriyah, Amarah, Qal&#x27;at Saleh, Wasit, and Basra, as well as in Baghdad (particularly the district of Dora). Historically, Mandaean quarters had also existed in southern Iraqi towns such as Qurna and Suq al-Shuyukh. Many also live across the border in Southwestern Iran in the cities of Ahvaz and Khorramshahr. Mandaean emigration from Iraq began during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule, but accelerated greatly after the American-led invasion and subsequent occupation. Since the invasion Mandaeans, like other Iraqi ethno-religious minorities (such as Assyrians, Armenians, Yazidi, Roma and Shabaks), have been subjected to violence, including murders, kidnappings, rapes, evictions, and forced conversions. Mandaeans, like many other Iraqis, have also been targeted for kidnapping since many worked as goldsmiths. Mandaeism is pacifistic and forbids its adherents from carrying weapons. During the 20th century in Iraq, most Mandaeans lived in large towns and cities, although a minority also lived in rural villages in the marshlands of southern Iraq.

Many Iraqi Mandaeans have fled the country in the face of this violence, and the Mandaean community in Iraq faces extinction. Out of the over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s, fewer than 5,000 to 10,000 remain there as of 2007. In early 2007, more than 80% of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan as a result of the Iraq War. In 2019, an Al-Monitor study estimated the Iraqi Mandaean population to be 3,000, 400 of which lived in the Erbil Governorate, which is 5% or less than the pre-Iraq war Mandaean population.

Mandaeans in the past were renowned silver and gold smiths, blacksmiths and boatbuilders, even before the Abbasid Caliphate when they gained fame as intellectuals in the cultural and scientific fields. In modern Iraq, Mandaeans have gained prominence as academics, writers, artists, poets, physicians, engineers and jewelers.

===Iranian Mandaeans===
The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press. Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.

Until the Iranian Revolution, Mandaeans were mainly concentrated in the Khuzestan Province, where the community used to coexist with the local Arab population. Other than the main cities of Ahvaz and Khorramshahr, Mandaean communities also existed in towns such as Chogha Zanbil in Shush County, Shushtar, and Abadan, as well as Mahshahr, Shadegan, Behbahan, and Susangerd (Khafajiyeh). Mandaean communities had also formerly existed in Dezful, Hamidiyeh, Hoveyzeh, Karun, and Abadan. They were mainly employed as goldsmiths, passing their skills from generation to generation. After the fall of the shah, its members faced increased religious discrimination, and many emigrated to Europe and the Americas.

In Iran, the &quot;Gozinesh&quot; Law (passed in 1985) has the effect of prohibiting Mandaeans from fully participating in civil life. This law and other &quot;gozinesh&quot; provisions make access to employment, education, and a range of other areas conditional upon a rigorous ideological screening, the principal prerequisite for which is devotion to the tenets of Islam. These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized, such as the Mandaeans, Yarsanis and Baháʼís.

In 2002, the US State Department granted Iranian Mandaeans protective refugee status. Since then, roughly 1,000 have emigrated to the US, now residing in cities such as San Antonio, Texas. On the other hand, the Mandaean community in Iran has increased over the last decade because of the exodus from Iraq of the main Mandaean community, which used to be 50,000–70,000 strong.

====Notable Iranian Mandaeans====
*Ganzibra Jabbar Choheili (1923–2014), head of the Mandaean community in Iran until his death in 2014.
*Rishama Salah Choheili, the current patriarch and head of the Mandaean community in Australia

===Other Middle Eastern Mandaeans===
Following the Iraq War, the Mandaean community dispersed mostly throughout Jordan, Syria, and Iran. Mandaeans in Jordan number about 2,500 (2018) and in Syria there are about 1,000 remaining (2015).

===Diaspora===

There are Mandaean diaspora populations in Sweden (c. 10,000–20,000), Australia (c. 10,000), the US (c. 4,000–7,000), the UK (c. 2,500), New Zealand and Canada. There are also Mandaeans living in Germany, the Netherlands (in Nijmegen, The Hague, etc.), Denmark, Finland, France, and smaller communities in Norway and Italy.

====Australia====

The Sydney metropolitan area in Australia has one of the largest Mandaean diaspora communities in the world. The community is centered in Greater Western Sydney suburbs such as Penrith and Liverpool. In Liverpool, the main mandi (Beth Manda) is Ganzibra Dakhil Mandi. The Sabian Mandaean Association of Australia has purchased land by the banks of the Nepean River at Wallacia, New South Wales in order to build a new mandi.

====Sweden====

Sweden became a popular destination because a Mandaean community existed there before the war and the Swedish government has a liberal asylum policy toward Iraqis. There are between 10,000 and 20,000 Mandaeans in Sweden (2019). The scattered nature of the Mandaean diaspora has raised fears among Mandaeans for the religion&#x27;s survival. Mandaeism does not allow conversion, and the religious status of Mandaeans who marry outside the faith and their children is disputed.

On September 15, 2018, the Beth Manda Yardna was consecrated in Dalby, Scania, Sweden.

====United States====

In the United States, Mandaean communities are centered in San Antonio (c. 2,500), New York City, San Diego, Winnetka, California, Austin, Texas, Worcester, Massachusetts (c. 2,500), Warren, Michigan, Chicago, and other major metropolitan areas. There is a mandi in Detroit.

The status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call upon the US government to extend refugee status to the community. In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an op-ed piece in which Swarthmore professor Nathaniel Deutsch called for the Bush administration to take immediate action to preserve the community. Iraqi Mandaeans were given refugee status by the US State Department in 2007. Since then, more than 2500 have entered the US, many settling in Worcester, Massachusetts. The community in Worcester is believed to be the largest in the United States and the second largest community outside the Middle East. About 2,600 Mandaeans from Iran have been settled in Texas since the Iraq War.

==Religion==
Mandaeans are a closed ethno-religious community, practicing Mandaeism, which is a monotheistic, Gnostic, and ethnic religion (Aramaic &quot;manda&quot; means &quot;knowledge,&quot; and is conceptually related to the Greek term &quot;gnosis&quot;.) Its adherents revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. Mandaeans consider Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem and John the Baptist to be prophets with Adam the founder of the religion and John being the greatest and final prophet.

The Mandaeans group existence into two main categories: light and darkness. They have a dualistic view of life, that encompasses both good and evil; all good is thought to have come from the World of Light (i.e. lightworld) and all evil from the World of Darkness. In relation to the body–mind dualism coined by Descartes, Mandaeans consider the body, and all material, worldly things, to have come from the dark, while the soul (sometimes referred to as the mind) is a product of the lightworld.

Mandaeans believe that there is a constant battle or conflict between the forces of good and evil. The forces of good are represented by &quot;Nhura&quot; (Light) and &quot;Maia Hayyi&quot; (Living Water) and those of evil are represented by &quot;Hshuka&quot; (darkness) and &quot;Maia Tahmi&quot; (dead or rancid water). The two waters are mixed in all things in order to achieve a balance. Mandaeans also believe in an afterlife or heaven called &quot;Alma d-Nhura&quot; (World of Light).

In Mandaeism, the World of Light is ruled by a Supreme God, known as Hayyi Rabbi (&#x27;The Great Life&#x27; or &#x27;The Great Living God&#x27;). Other names used are (&#x27;Lord of Greatness&#x27;), (&#x27;The Great Mind&#x27;), (&#x27;King of Light&#x27;) and (&#x27;The First Life&#x27;). God is so great, vast, and incomprehensible that no words can fully depict how awesome God is. It is believed that an innumerable number of uthras (angels or guardians), manifested from the light, surround and perform acts of worship to praise and honor God. They inhabit worlds separate from the lightworld and some are commonly referred to as emanations and are subservient beings to &#x27;The First Life&#x27;; their names include Second, Third, and Fourth Life (i.e. Yōšamin, Abathur, and Ptahil).

The Lord of Darkness (Krun) is the ruler of the World of Darkness formed from dark waters representing chaos. A main defender of the darkworld is a giant monster, or dragon, with the name Ur, and an evil, female ruler also inhabits the darkworld, known as Ruha. The Mandaeans believe these malevolent rulers created demonic offspring who consider themselves the owners of the seven planets and twelve zodiac constellations.

According to Mandaean beliefs, the material world is a mixture of light and dark created by Ptahil, who fills the role of the demiurge, with help from dark powers, such as Ruha, the Seven, and the Twelve. Adam&#x27;s body (believed to be the first human created by God in Abrahamic tradition) was fashioned by these dark beings, however his soul (or mind) was a direct creation from the Light. Therefore, many Mandaeans believe the human soul is capable of salvation because it originates from the lightworld. The soul, sometimes referred to as the &#x27;inner Adam&#x27; or &quot;Adam kasia&quot;, is in dire need of being rescued from the dark, so it may ascend into the heavenly realm of the lightworld. Baptisms are a central theme in Mandaeism, believed to be necessary for the redemption of the soul. Mandaeans do not perform a single baptism, as in religions such as Christianity; rather, they view baptisms as a ritual act capable of bringing the soul closer to salvation. Therefore, Mandaeans are baptized repeatedly during their lives. John the Baptist is a key figure for the Mandaeans; they consider him to have been a Nasoraean Mandaean. John is referred to as their greatest and final teacher.
==Scholarship==

According to Edmondo Lupieri, as stated in his article in &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;,

Lupieri believes Mandaeism is a post-Christian southern Mesopotamian Gnostic off-shoot and claims that Zazai d-Gawazta to be the founder of Mandaeism in the 2nd century. Jorunn J. Buckley refutes this by confirming scribes that predate Zazai who copied the Ginza Rabba. In addition to Edmondo Lupieri, Christa Müller-Kessler argues against the Palestinian origin theory of the Mandaeans claiming that the Mandaeans are Mesopotamian. Edwin Yamauchi believes Mandaeism&#x27;s origin lies in the Transjordan where a group of &#x27;non-Jews&#x27; migrated to Mesopotamia and combined their Gnostic beliefs with indigenous Mesopotamian beliefs at the end of the 2nd century CE. Kevin van Bladel claims that Mandaeism originated no earlier than 5th century Sassanid Mesopotamia, a thesis which has been criticized by James F. McGrath. Al-Zuhairy (1998) believes that the roots of Mandaeism lies in Mesopotamia, inherited from the Sumerians, and the present form of Mandaeism likely emerged in Mesopotamia in the 3rd century BCE.

The Mandaean author Aziz Sbahi in his book, &quot;The Origins of Sabians and their Religious Beliefs&quot;, traced the Mandaeans to the Babylonian Era. Sbahi, who is known more as a secretary of the Iraqi Communist Party, acknowledges that Mandaeism may have been affected by religions in Mesopotamia and the Dead Sea region. Sbahi believes that Mandaeism originated in surroundings that had Hellenic, Babylonian, Gnostic and Judaic influence. However, due to Sbahi&#x27;s lack of knowledge of the Mandaic language, he read only secondary sources on the Mandaeans. Brikha Nasoraia, a Mandaean priest and scholar, believes in a two-origin theory in which he considers the contemporary Mandaeans to have descended from both proto-Mandaeans originating in the Jordan valley as well as another group of Mandaeans (or Gnostics) indigenous to southern Mesopotamia.

Scholars specializing in Mandaeism such as Kurt Rudolph, Mark Lidzbarski, Rudolf Macúch, Ethel S. Drower, Eric Segelberg, James F. McGrath, Charles G. Häberl, Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, and Şinasi Gündüz argue for an Israelite origin. The majority of these scholars believe that the Mandaeans likely have a historical connection with John the Baptist&#x27;s inner circle of disciples. Charles Häberl, who is also a linguist specializing in Mandaic, finds Jewish Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek and Latin influence on Mandaic and accepts Mandaeans having a &quot;shared Israelite history with Jews&quot;. In addition, scholars such as Richard August Reitzenstein, Rudolf Bultmann, G. R. S. Mead, Samuel Zinner, Richard Thomas, J. C. Reeves, Gilles Quispel, and K. Beyer also argue for a Judea/Palestine or Jordan Valley origin for the Mandaeans. James McGrath and Richard Thomas believe there is a direct connection between Mandaeism and pre-exilic traditional Israelite religion. Lady Ethel S. Drower &quot;sees early Christianity as a Mandaean heresy&quot; and adds &quot;heterodox Judaism in Galilee and Samaria appears to have taken shape in the form we now call gnostic, and it may well have existed some time before the Christian era.&quot; Barbara Thiering questions the dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls and suggests that the Teacher of Righteousness (leader of the Essenes) was John the Baptist. Jorunn J. Buckley accepts Mandaeism&#x27;s Israelite or Judean origins and adds:
==Other names==
===Sabians===

During the 9th and 10th centuries several religious groups came to be identified with the mysterious Sabians (sometimes also spelled &#x27;Sabaeans&#x27; or &#x27;Sabeans&#x27;, but not to be confused with the Sabaeans of South Arabia) mentioned in the Quran alongside the Jews, the Christians, and the Zoroastrians as a &#x27;people of the book&#x27; (). These religious groups, which included the Mandaeans but also various pagan groups in Harran (Upper Mesopotamia) and the marshlands of southern Iraq, claimed the name in order to be recognized by the Muslim authorities as a people of the book deserving of legal protection (). The earliest source to unambiguously apply the term &#x27;Sabian&#x27; to the Mandaeans was al-Hasan ibn Bahlul () citing the Abbasid vizier Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Muqla (–940). However, it is not clear whether the Mandaeans of this period already identified themselves as Sabians or whether the claim originated with Ibn Muqla.

Some modern scholars have identified the Sabians mentioned in the Quran as Mandaeans, although many other possible identifications have been proposed. Some scholars believe it is impossible to establish their original identity with any degree of certainty. Mandaeans continue to be called Sabians to this day.

===Nasoraeans===

The Haran Gawaita uses the name Nasoraeans for the Mandaeans arriving from Jerusalem meaning guardians or possessors of secret rites and knowledge. Scholars such as Kurt Rudolph, Rudolf Macúch, Mark Lidzbarski and Ethel S. Drower connect the Mandaeans with the Nasaraeans described by Epiphanius, a group within the Essenes according to Joseph Lightfoot. Epiphanius says (29:6) that they existed before Christ. That is questioned by some, but others accept the pre-Christian origin of the Nasaraeans.

==Language==

Neo-Mandaic is the contemporary language spoken by some Mandaeans, while Classical Mandaic is the liturgical language of Mandaeism. However, most Mandaeans currently do not speak conversational Neo-Mandaic in everyday life, but rather the languages of their host countries, such as Arabic, Farsi, or English.

<doc id="193497" wikidata="Q862646" url="?curid=193497" title="Bill Werbeniuk">
<text>William Alexander Werbeniuk ( ; 14 January 1947 – 20 January 2003) was a Canadian professional snooker and pool player. Recognisable for his girth, he was nicknamed &quot;Big Bill&quot;. Werbeniuk was a four-time World Championship quarter-finalist and also a UK Championship semi-finalist, reaching a career high world ranking of #8 for the 1983–84 season.

==Early life==
William Werbeniuk was born on 14 January 1947 in Winnipeg. His paternal grandfather had immigrated to Canada from Ukraine; his father, according to Werbeniuk, &quot;was one of the biggest fences in Canada&quot; and &quot;committed armed robberies, peddled drugs, every larceny in the language.&quot; His father also owned Pop&#x27;s Billiards on Logan Avenue in Winnipeg, where Werbeniuk began playing snooker as a child. Werbeniuk spent a portion of his youth travelling with Cliff Thorburn and playing pool for money.

==Career==
Werbeniuk won the Amateur Championship in 1973, with a 16–15 victory against Robert Paquette after being 12–15 behind. This qualified him for the North American Amateur Championship. He won the North American Amateur Championship by defeating Cliff Thorburn 26–22, winning five of the last six frames after the pair were level at 21–21.

His playing record included a 9–8 quarter-final loss to John Pulman in the 1975 Canadian Open and quarter-final losses in the 1978 and 1979 World Championships to Ray Reardon and John Virgo respectively. He reached the semi-finals of the UK Championships (when it opened to non-UK based residents) but lost 9–3 to the reigning world champion Terry Griffiths. He suffered a third World quarter-final defeat to Reardon in 1981 by 13–10.

In the 1983 Lada Classic, Bill reached his first major final, but was beaten by Steve Davis 9–5. Werbeniuk again reached the quarter-finals of the World Championships, in the same year, losing 13–11 to Alex Higgins, and reached his second major final in the summer, losing 7–3 to compatriot Cliff Thorburn in the Winfield Masters in Australia.

===Alcohol consumption===
Werbeniuk was noted for the copious amounts of alcohol he consumed before and during matches – at least six pints before a match and then one pint for each frame. In total, he drank between 40 and 50 pints of lager per day. Doctors advised Werbeniuk to drink alcohol to counteract a familial benign essential tremor. Later in his career he also took propranolol, a beta blocker, to cope with the effects of his alcohol consumption on his heart.

Werbeniuk was reported to have successfully claimed the cost of 6 pints of lager before every match as a tax deductible expense.

Some of Werbeniuk&#x27;s alleged feats of drinking include:
76 cans of lager during a game with John Spencer in Australia in the 1970s;
43 pints of lager in a snooker match/drinking contest against Scotsman Eddie Sinclair in which, after Sinclair had passed out following his 42nd pint, Werbeniuk was reported to say &quot;I&#x27;m away to the bar now for a proper drink&quot;; 
28 pints of lager and 16 whiskies over the course of 11 frames during a match against Nigel Bond, in January 1990 – after which Werbeniuk then consumed an entire bottle of Scotch to &quot;drown his sorrows&quot; after losing the match.

===Split trouser incident===
A memorable incident occurred during a televised match against Dennis Taylor in the World Team Tournament. Werbeniuk tried to stretch across the table, but due to his size was having some difficulty. Eventually he split his trousers. The ripping noise it made caused many in the audience, including his opponent, to laugh out loud. Werbeniuk took it in good humour, asking the audience &quot;who did that?&quot; as if insinuating that the noise was attributed to flatulence.

===Trick shots===
In another incident, playing against Joe Johnson, Werbeniuk made what the announcer termed the &quot;pot of the century&quot; when he potted a long red by jumping the cue ball so that it bounced in front of and over an interposing red, knocking the object red in. Later in the match, he got an unusual fluke, when he missed a simple brown to the top corner, but it cannoned out of the pocket, off the opposite cushion and into the centre pocket on the same side.

===Use of propranolol===
Werbeniuk was ranked 8th in the world in 1983 and reached the quarter-finals of the World Snooker Championship four times before propranolol was banned in snooker competition, as it was classified as a performance-enhancing drug by the International Olympic Committee, the anti-doping rules of which were adopted by World Snooker. Werbeniuk said that his use was medicinal only and under doctor&#x27;s orders, but was fined and sanctioned anyway.

His career effectively over, he returned to Vancouver, where he lived with his mother and brother. A bankruptcy order was filed against him in 1991, and he lived on disability benefits.

==Death==
Werbeniuk died of heart failure on 20 January 2003, six days after his 56th birthday.

<text>Cleethorpes () is a seaside town on the estuary of the Humber in North East Lincolnshire, Lincolnshire, England with a population of 29,678 in 2021. It has been permanently occupied since the 6th century, with fishing as its original industry, then developing into a resort in the 19th century. Before becoming a unified town, Cleethorpes was made up of the three small villages of Itterby, Oole and Thrunscoe.

The town lies on the Greenwich meridian and its average annual rainfall is amongst the lowest in the British Isles.

In 2021, The Trainline named Cleethorpes beach the second best seaside destination in the UK that is reachable by train, just behind Margate.

==History==

Before becoming a unified town, Cleethorpes was made up of three small villages: Itterby, Oole and Thrunscoe, which were part of a wider parish called Clee (centred on Old Clee) named from &quot;clee&quot;, an old form of the word &quot;clay&quot;. The name &quot;Cleethorpes&quot; is of comparatively recent origin, combining the parish &quot;Clee&quot; with &quot;thorp&quot;, an Old English/Old Norse word for &quot;village&quot;. The earliest attestations are 1552 for singular &quot;Clethorpe&quot; (meaning Itterby) and 1588 for plural &quot;Clethorpes&quot; (including Oole, adjacent to Itterby; later also Thrunscoe slightly to the south).

Whilst there are Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in the area, permanent occupation appears to date from the 6th century, with substantial communities appearing only in the 9th century when the Danes arrived.

The manor of Itterby was purchased in 1616 by the trustees of Peter Blundell&#x27;s charity for the benefit of scholars and fellows at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge from Blundell&#x27;s School, Tiverton.

Cleethorpes developed as a fishing village. By the time of the 1801 census the population was 284. The 1820s saw the first developments of Cleethorpes as a health holiday resort, with sea-bathing and the taking of medicinal waters becoming fashionable. By 1831 the population had increased to 497.
In 1842 the (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. &quot;1&quot; ) was enacted. of land were divided among land owners and eight new roads developed. In 1848 Cleethorpes was described as &lt;br&gt;&quot;...much resorted to as a bathing-place, for which it is highly eligible; the air is pure, the scenery good and besides a few lodging-houses and smaller inns, there is a large hotel, built some years since, on an eminence embracing extensive views of the sea, the Humber, and the Yorkshire coast. Many of the population are employed in the oyster-fisheries.&quot;

The resort expanded following the linking of the town by railway with industrial towns in Yorkshire. Cleethorpes Pier opened in 1873 and the promenade in 1885. Cleethorpes with Thrunscoe was created as a Local Board of Health District in 1873, and under the Local Government Act of 1894 it became an urban district. Its headquarters was established at Cleethorpes Town Hall in 1905.

In 1916 the urban district was renamed &quot;Cleethorpes&quot;, and in 1922 and 1927 the town&#x27;s boundaries were extended to include part of Humberston (as far as North Sea Lane) and the Beacon Hill area of Weelsby parish. In 1936 Cleethorpes was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough.

Cleethorpes successfully resisted attempts by Grimsby to absorb it and in 1974 it became the Borough of Cleethorpes within the new county of Humberside. However, when Humberside County Council was abolished in 1996, Cleethorpes Borough Council was joined with Grimsby Borough Council as the unitary authority of North East Lincolnshire. In 2009 North East Lincolnshire Council agreed to market the towns of Grimsby, Immingham and Cleethorpes, under the &#x27;Greater Grimsby&#x27; banner.

Local residents from Lincolnshire and the Yorkshire and Humber area affectionately refer to Cleethorpes and its residents as &quot;Meggies&quot;. Cleethorpes can also be known as &quot;down beach&quot;.

==Redevelopment==

The Winter Gardens, a venue for a variety of events, was demolished in 2007 and replaced by 47 flats. During a mass boycott of punk bands in the 1970s the Winter Gardens was just one of five U.K. venues that allowed the likes of the Clash, AC/DC and the Sex Pistols to perform. The old mini steam railway running from the seafront Leisure centre to St Anthony&#x27;s bank has been extended and significantly improved whilst a cafe, taphouse, and gallery has been added to the boating lake, many ducks and geese use the boating lake to breed making it a pleasant place to visit. A large open air show ground has been built close to the eastern end of the boating lake often showing live bands and hosting special events, most notably hosting the London 2012 Olympic torch relay.

A new RNLI station is set to be completed on the Central Promenade by 2025.

The old Cleethorpes bathing pool was demolished and replaced in the eighties with a modern leisure centre. Facilities include a large indoor wave pool, badminton and squash courts, a gym and sports hall. The local badminton club meets here.

A greyhound racing track was opened around the outside of the stock car racing track in 1981, which was on the site of the former Cleethorpes Marineland &amp; Zoo which closed in 1977. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club NGRC) and was known as a &quot;flapping track&quot;, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. In 1983, there were plans to build new kennels and join the NGRC but racing only lasted until midway through 1986. The stock cars closed in the mid-1990s.

==Landmarks==
The seaside resort of Cleethorpes lies on the Humber Estuary; thus the sea at Cleethorpes is the mouth of the Humber. There are several hundred metres of sand at low tide.

The sea front provides views of shipping traffic entering and leaving the Humber for the ports of Grimsby, Immingham, Hull and Goole.

Two large fortifications, the Humber Forts, are visible in the mouth of the river. On a clear day, the lighthouse situated on Spurn Point can be seen with the naked eye from the North Beach.

There is a Royal National Lifeboat Institution station near the pier and next to the Coastguard on Central Promenade. Work began on a new, larger RNLI station in 2022. Cleethorpes Rescue also protect the beach.
Cleethorpes has a large boating lake with many varieties of ducks, swans and geese. There is also a local nature reserve: Cleethorpes Country Park, situated between the resort and the village of Humberston. To the south of Cleethorpes, near Humberston, is a yacht club.

The Cleethorpes Leisure Centre was opened in 1983 to replace the open bathing pool that was wrecked by storms on 11 January 1978. The leisure centre contains a 33-metre pool, 1.8 metres deep, as well as a water slide and a wave machine. The building also contains a gym and a sports hall. In 2012, major work was carried out to the roof of the building due to water damage.

Ross Castle, a mock ruin of a castle built in 1885 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, was named after Edward Ross, secretary of the railway company. Its height was the highest point on the cliffs. After a period of closure, the castle was renovated, re-opening in June 2008 to the public. Possibilities of a further closure have been raised after a woman fell to her death on 9 January 2009.

In 2007 the town was the Royal Horticultural Societies Britain in Bloom award winner in the coastal category. The town was also received a Silver-Gilt award, a Tourism Award (for Lollipop Road Train) and Jeff Blanchard the Shredded Wheat Community Champions award.

A statue of the Boy with the Leaking Boot was given to the town in 1918 by John Carlborn. It is reported that he was a Swedish immigrant to Cleethorpes who had built up a successful shipping business, and that the statue was a copy of one in the Hasselbacken Restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden. The Cleethorpes statue now stands in a pond in the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Gardens, on Kingsway. It was stolen and replaced in 2002 and 2008, and vandalised in October 2011. In July 2012, two youths were recorded on CCTV as they frolicked naked in the pond and destroyed the fountain. A replacement statue was made by a local garden ornaments manufacturer and installed with improved security in September 2012. A nearby pub was named &quot;The Leaking Boot&quot;, but was destroyed by fire in June 2009.

In 2019, a community alleyway on Kew Road was vandalized. The alley is known for hosting Cleethorpes In Bloom competition, and was a recipient of many awards over the past few years.

<text>Veliko Tarnovo (, ; &quot;Great Tarnovo&quot;) is a city in north central Bulgaria and the administrative centre of Veliko Tarnovo Province. It is the historical and cultural capital of Bulgaria.

Often referred to as the &quot;City of the Tsars&quot;, Veliko Tarnovo is located on the Yantra River and is famously known as the historical capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, attracting many tourists with its unique architecture. The old part of the town is situated on three hills, Tsarevets, Trapezitsa, and Sveta Gora, rising amidst the meanders of the Yantra. On Tsarevets are the palaces of the Bulgarian emperors and the Patriarchate, the Patriarchal Cathedral, and also a number of administrative and residential edifices surrounded by thick walls.

Trapezitsa is known for its many churches and as the former main residence of the nobility. During the Middle Ages, the town was among the main European centres of culture and gave its name to the architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School, painting of the Tarnovo Artistic School, and to literature. Veliko Tarnovo is an important administrative, economic, educational, and cultural centre of Northern Bulgaria.

==Etymology==

The most widespread theory for the name&#x27;s origin holds that its original names of &quot;Tarnovgrad&quot; (Търновград) and &quot;Tarnovo&quot; (Търново) come from the Old Bulgarian тръневъ (&quot;tranev&quot;) or тръновъ (&quot;tranov&quot;), meaning &quot;thorny&quot;. The suffix &quot;grad&quot; means &quot;city&quot; in Bulgarian and in many Slavic languages. In 1965, the word велико (&quot;veliko&quot;), meaning &quot;great&quot;, was added to the original name in honour of the town&#x27;s status as an old capital of Bulgaria. This also helps distinguish it from the town of Malko Tarnovo. In Ottoman Turkish, it was called &quot;طرنوه&quot; (Modern Turkish: Tırnova).

== Symbols ==

The anthem of the city is Shishman&#x27;s song, dedicated to the last Bulgarian king of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom. The coat of arms of Tarnovo depicts a figure with three lions. Purple color was used for the flag of the city, because during the excavations in the church St. Forty Martyrs, purple clothes of rulers were found. There is also a key and a necklace of Veliko Tarnovo. The first known coat of arms of the city is from 1921 by Dimitar Bagrilov.

== History ==

=== Prehistory and antiquity ===

Veliko Tarnovo is one of the oldest settlements in Bulgaria, with a history of more than five millennia. The first traces of human presence, dating from the 3rd millennium BC, were discovered on Trapezitsa Hill.

=== First Bulgarian state ===
Tarnovo was a stronghold of the First Bulgarian Empire. A number of coins, specimens and ceramics from the First Bulgarian State were found on the hills on which the capital city of Tarnovgrad stretched. The city was important for the first Bulgarian state. There was an important military garrison in it. In the church of St. Forty Martyrs specimens were found that historians believe are the work of Bulgarians from Volga Bulgaria.

=== Uprising of Asen and Peter ===
The Uprising of Asen and Peter began on 26 October 1185, the feast day of St. Demetrius of Thessaloniki, and ended with the restoration of Bulgaria with the creation of the Second Bulgarian Empire, ruled by the Asen dynasty. Old Tarnovo would serve as the capital.

=== Medieval Bulgarian rule ===
Veliko Tarnovo, originally &quot;Tarnovgrad&quot; (Търновград), grew quickly to become the strongest Bulgarian fortification and most prosperous city during the second half of the High and the Late Middle Ages and also most important political, economic, cultural and religious centre of the empire. In the 14th century, the city was described by Bulgarian cleric Gregory Tsamblak as &quot;a very large city, handsome and surrounded by walls, with 12,000 to 15,000 inhabitants&quot;., the fortress of Tsarevets being the primary fortress and strongest bulwark from 1185 to 1393, housing the royal and the patriarchal palaces.

In the 14th century, as the Byzantine Empire weakened, Tarnovo claimed to be the Third Rome, based on its preeminent cultural influence in Southeastern Europe.

As the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire, Tarnovo was a quasi-cosmopolitan city, with many foreign merchants and envoys. Tarnovo is known to have had Armenian, Jewish and Roman Catholic (&quot;Frankish&quot;) merchant quarters, besides a dominant Bulgarian population. The discovery of three Gothic heads of statuettes indicates there may have also been a Catholic church.

=== Ottoman rule ===

The political upsurge and spiritual development of Tarnovo were halted when the Ottoman Empire captured the city on 17 July 1393. The siege lasted for three months, with the Bulgarian Patriarch Evtimiy leading the defence. Three years later, the Ottomans conquered the entire Bulgarian Empire.

Bulgarian resistance against Ottoman rule remained centred in Tarnovo (then known as &quot;Tırnova&quot;) until the end of the 17th century. Two major anti-Ottoman uprisings – in 1598 and in 1686 – started in the city. Tarnovo was consecutively a district (&quot;sanjak&quot;) capital in the Rumelia Eyalet, in the Silistria Eyalet, and finally in the Danube Vilayet.


Tarnovgrad, along with the rest of present-day Bulgaria, remained under Ottoman rule until the 19th century, when national identity and culture reasserted themselves as a strengthening resistance movement. The goal of the establishment of an independent Bulgarian church and nation motivated the 1875 and 1876 uprisings in the city. On 23 April 1876, the April uprising marked the beginning of the end of the Ottoman occupation. It was soon followed by the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878).
=== Third Bulgarian State ===

On 7 July 1877, Russian general Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko liberated Veliko Tarnovo, ending the 480-year rule of the Ottoman Empire. In 1878, the Treaty of Berlin created a Principality of Bulgaria between the Danube and the Stara Planina range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of Veliko Tarnovo. Due to the capture of Tarnovo by Russian forces, the Muslim refugees fled to Anatolia.

On 17 April 1879, the first National Assembly convened in Veliko Tarnovo to ratify the state&#x27;s first constitution, known as the Tarnovo Constitution, resulting in the transfer of parliament from Tarnovgrad to Sofia, which today remains the Bulgarian capital.

In deference to the city&#x27;s past, Tsar Ferdinand, of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, chose the Forty Holy Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo as the place to declare the complete independence of Bulgaria on 5 October 1908.

In 1965, the city, then officially known as &quot;Tarnovo&quot;, was renamed &quot;Veliko Tarnovo&quot; (Great Tarnovo) to commemorate its rich history and importance.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria ===

During Communist rule, the city underwent considerable changes, with some 10,000 of its population thought to have become members of the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) by the end of the 1940s. A number of its churches and private enterprises were closed, while the major industries were nationalized. In the early 1950s, the city underwent an intensive process of urbanization, expanding to the west. From the same period also dates the idea of creating a large urban area in Northern Bulgaria encompassing the neighboring city of Veliko Tarnovo and the towns of Gorna Oryahovitsa and Lyaskovets (popularly known as &quot;Targolyas&quot;).

In 1963, the University of Veliko Tarnovo &quot;St. Cyril and St. Methodius&quot; opened as one of the largest institutions of higher education in the country. Urbanization continued during the 1970s, as the engineering, electronic, medical, computer, and furniture industries expanded in the region, adding the neighborhoods of Akacia and Kartala to the city&#x27;s landscape.

<text>A toddler is a child approximately 1 to 3 years old, though definitions vary. The toddler years are a time of great cognitive, emotional and social development. The word is derived from &quot;toddle&quot;, which means to walk unsteadily, as children at this age do.

== Developmental milestones ==
Toddler development can be broken down into a number of interrelated areas. There is reasonable consensus about what these areas may include:
* Physical: growth or an increase in size.
* Gross motor: the control of large muscles which enable walking, running, jumping and climbing.
* Fine motor: the ability to control small muscles; enabling the toddler to feed themselves, draw and manipulate objects.
* Vision: the ability to see near and far and interpret what is seen.
* Hearing and speech: the ability to hear and receive information and listen (interpret), and the ability to understand and learn language and use it to communicate effectively.
* Social: the ability to interact with the world through playing with others, taking turns and fantasy play.

Although it is useful to chart defined periods of development, development exists on a continuum, with considerable differences between individual children. There is a wide range of what may be considered &#x27;normal&#x27; development. However, according to experts, there are specific milestones that should be achieved by certain ages and stages in life in order to properly grow and develop. Medical experts also point out that children develop in their own time and suggest that carers should not worry too much if a child fails to reach all the milestones for their age range. Premature birth or illness during infancy may also slow down a young child&#x27;s development.

Below follows a rough breakdown of the kinds of skills and attributes which young children can be expected to have developed by different points during the toddler period.
===Early milestones and intelligence===

It has long been known that markedly late achievement of developmental milestones is related to intellectual or physical disabilities. However, it was thought for a long time that within the general population no relationship between the age of passing developmental milestones and later intelligence is seen. It was only more recently discovered that early passing of developmental milestones indicates in general a higher level of intelligence. A study from 2007 based on more than 5,000 children born in the United Kingdom in 1946 showed that for every month earlier a child learned to stand, there was a gain of one half of one intelligence quotient point at age 8. Also a later 2018 study found a relationship between milestone achievement and intelligence in adulthood (in this case, the milestone used was being able to name objects/animals in pictures at less than 18 months, 18–24 months, and later than 24 months). The IQ of children who were able to form a sentence at less than 24 months of age averaged 107 points, whereas children who were able to form a sentence later than 24 months of age in young adulthood (20–34 years old) had an average IQ of 101. Early passing developmental milestones and the head circumference up to the age of 3 years explained about 6% of variance in IQ in adulthood. In comparison, parental socioeconomic status and the child&#x27;s sex explained about 23% of the variance in IQ. However, experts advise against rushing children through milestones, as long as they are reaching them within a normal range.

==Toilet training==

# Readiness: The child should be physiologically and psychologically capable. Physiologic preparedness describes the ability of the child to perform tasks such as controlling their anal and urethral sphincter, sitting upright, and walking. Psychological readiness describes the child&#x27;s motivation to become toilet trained and their ability to understand and follow directions.
# Process training.
# Parental response.

== Squatting ==
Young children squat instinctively as a continuous movement from standing up whenever they want to lower themselves to ground level. One- and two-year-olds can commonly be seen playing in a stable squatting position, with feet wide apart and bottom not quite touching the floor, although at first they need to hold on to something to stand up again.

==Language==
Talking is the next milestone of which parents are typically aware. A toddler&#x27;s first word often occurs around 12 months, but this is only an average. The child will then continue to steadily add to his or her vocabulary until around the age of 18 months when language increases rapidly. He or she may learn as many as 7–9 new words a day. Around this time, toddlers generally know about 50 words. At 21 months is when toddlers begin to incorporate two word phrases into their vocabulary, such as &quot;I go&quot;, &quot;mama give&quot;, and &quot;baby play&quot;. Before going to sleep they often engage in a monologue called crib talk in which they practice conversational skills. At this age, children are becoming very proficient at conveying their wants and needs to their parents in a verbal fashion.

==Emotions and self-image==
There are several other important milestones that are achieved in this time period that parents tend not to emphasize as much as walking and talking. Gaining the ability to point at whatever it is the child wants you to see shows huge psychological gains in a toddler. This generally happens before a child&#x27;s first birthday.

This age is sometimes referred to as &quot;the terrible twos&quot;, because of the temper tantrums for which they are famous. This stage can begin as early as nine months old depending on the child and environment. Toddlers tend to have temper tantrums because they have such strong emotions but do not know how to express themselves the way that older children and adults do. Immediate causes can include physical factors such as hunger, discomfort and fatigue or a child&#x27;s desire to gain greater independence and control of the environment around them. The toddler is discovering that they are a separate being from their parent and are testing their boundaries in learning the way the world around them works. Although the toddler is in their exploratory phase, it is also important to understand that the methods used by the parents for communicating with the toddler can either set off a tantrum or calm the situation. Research has shown that parents with histories of maltreatment, violence exposure, and related psychopathology may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively and in a developmentally appropriate manner to their toddlers&#x27; tantrums and thus may benefit from parent-child mental health consultation. This time between the ages of two and five when they are reaching for independence repeats itself during adolescence.

Self-awareness is another milestone that helps parents understand how a toddler is reacting. Around 18 months of age, a child will begin to recognize himself or herself as a separate physical being with his/her own thoughts and actions. A parent can test if this milestone has been reached by noticing if the toddler recognizes that their reflection in a mirror is in fact themselves. One way to test this is the rouge test: putting lipstick on the child&#x27;s face and showing them their own reflection. Upon seeing the out-of-the-ordinary mark, if the child reaches to his or her own face, the child has achieved this important milestone. Along with self recognition comes feelings of embarrassment and pride that the child had not previously experienced.

<text>The Death of a Dictionary is the debut album by alternative rock band Public Affection. An EP titled &quot;Divided Mind, Divided Planet&quot; followed before the band changed their name to Live.

==History==
The album was released in June 1989, when the band members graduated from high school, via their own label, Action Front Records. Just 1,000 copies of the album were made, all on cassette, and it is long out of print. The track &quot;Good Pain&quot; was eventually reworked for inclusion on the first Live EP, &quot;Four Songs&quot;, and their debut album &quot;Mental Jewelry.&quot; Aside from &quot;Good Pain&quot;, the remainder of the songs are still only officially available on this cassette, although the album is widely available on the internet via download.

<text>Science is the peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and one of the world&#x27;s top academic journals. It was first published in 1880, is currently circulated weekly and has a subscriber base of around 130,000. Because institutional subscriptions and online access serve a larger audience, its estimated readership is over 400,000 people.

&quot;Science&quot; is based in Washington, D.C., United States, with a second office in Cambridge, UK.

== Contents ==

The major focus of the journal is publishing important original scientific research and research reviews, but &quot;Science&quot; also publishes science-related news, opinions on science policy and other matters of interest to scientists and others who are concerned with the wide implications of science and technology. Unlike most scientific journals, which focus on a specific field, &quot;Science&quot; and its rival &quot;Nature&quot; cover the full range of scientific disciplines. According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;″s 2023 impact factor was 44.7.

Studies of methodological quality and reliability have found that some high-prestige journals including &quot;Science&quot; &quot;publish significantly substandard structures&quot;, and overall &quot;reliability of published research works in several fields may be decreasing with increasing journal rank&quot;.

Although it is the journal of the AAAS, membership in the AAAS is not required to publish in &quot;Science&quot;. Papers are accepted from authors around the world. Competition to publish in &quot;Science&quot; is very intense, as an article published in such a highly cited journal can lead to attention and career advancement for the authors. Fewer than 7% of articles submitted are accepted for publication.

==History==

&quot;Science&quot; was founded by New York journalist John Michels in 1880 with financial support from Thomas Edison and later from Alexander Graham Bell. (Edison received favorable editorial treatment in return, without disclosure of the financial relationship, at a time when his reputation was suffering due to delays producing the promised commercially viable light bulb.) However, the journal never gained enough subscribers to succeed and ended publication in March 1882. Alexander Graham Bell and Gardiner Greene Hubbard bought the magazine rights and hired young entomologist Samuel H. Scudder to resurrect the journal one year later. They had some success while covering the meetings of prominent American scientific societies, including the AAAS. However, by 1894, &quot;Science&quot; was again in financial difficulty and was sold to psychologist James McKeen Cattell for .

In an agreement worked out by Cattell and AAAS secretary Leland O. Howard, &quot;Science&quot; became the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1900. During the early part of the 20th century, important articles published in &quot;Science&quot; included papers on fruit fly genetics by Thomas Hunt Morgan, gravitational lensing by Albert Einstein, and spiral nebulae by Edwin Hubble. After Cattell died in 1944, the ownership of the journal was transferred to the AAAS.

After Cattell&#x27;s death in 1944, the journal lacked a consistent editorial presence until Graham DuShane became editor in 1956. In 1958, under DuShane&#x27;s leadership, &quot;Science&quot; absorbed &quot;The Scientific Monthly&quot;, thus increasing the journal&#x27;s circulation by over from 38,000 to more than 61,000. Physicist Philip Abelson, a co-discoverer of neptunium, served as editor from 1962 to 1984. Under Abelson the efficiency of the review process was improved and the publication practices were brought up to date. During this time, papers on the Apollo program missions and some of the earliest reports on AIDS were published.

Biochemist Daniel E. Koshland Jr. served as editor from 1985 until 1995. From 1995 until 2000, neuroscientist Floyd E. Bloom held that position. Biologist Donald Kennedy became the editor of &quot;Science&quot; in 2000. Biochemist Bruce Alberts took his place in March 2008. Geophysicist Marcia McNutt became editor-in-chief in June 2013. During her tenure the family of journals expanded to include &quot;Science Robotics&quot; and &quot;Science Immunology&quot;, and open access publishing with &quot;Science Advances&quot;. Jeremy M. Berg became editor-in-chief on July 1, 2016. Former Washington University in St. Louis Provost Holden Thorp was named editor-in-chief on Monday, August 19, 2019.

In February 2001, draft results of the human genome were simultaneously published by &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; with &quot;Science&quot; publishing the Celera Genomics paper and &quot;Nature&quot; publishing the publicly funded Human Genome Project. In 2007, &quot;Science &quot;(together with &quot;Nature&quot;) received the Prince of Asturias Award for Communications and Humanity. In 2015, Rush D. Holt Jr., chief executive officer of the AAAS and executive publisher of &quot;Science&quot;, stated that the journal was becoming increasingly international: &quot;[I]nternationally co-authored papers are now the norm—they represent almost 60 percent of the papers. In 1992, it was slightly less than 20 percent.&quot;

==Availability==

The latest editions of the journal are available online, through the main journal website, only to subscribers, AAAS members, and for delivery to IP addresses at institutions that subscribe; students, K–12 teachers, and some others can subscribe at a reduced fee. However, research articles published after 1997 are available for free (with online registration) one year after they are published i.e. delayed open access. Significant public-health related articles are also available for free, sometimes immediately after publication. AAAS members may also access the pre-1997 Science archives at the &quot;Science&quot; website, where it is called &quot;Science Classic&quot;. Institutions can opt to add Science Classic to their subscriptions for an additional fee. Some older articles can also be accessed via JSTOR and ProQuest.

The journal also participates in initiatives that provide free or low-cost access to readers in developing countries, including HINARI, OARE, AGORA, and Scidev.net.

Other features of the &quot;Science&quot; website include the free &quot;ScienceNow&quot; section with &quot;up to the minute news from science&quot;, and &quot;ScienceCareers&quot;, which provides free career resources for scientists and engineers. Science Express (Sciencexpress) provides advance electronic publication of selected &quot;Science&quot; papers.

<text>William H. Calvin (born April 30, 1939) is an American theoretical neurophysiologist and professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. He is known for popularizing neuroscience and evolutionary biology, including the hybrid of those two fields, neural Darwinism. He relates abrupt climate change to human evolution and more recently has been working on global climate change issues.

In his 1996 book &quot;How Brains Think: Evolving Intelligence, Then and Now&quot;, Calvin writes as an advocate of the idea that brain-based Darwinian processes are what provides brains with what are called &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot;. Calvin starts with the harmless division of brain processes into two types, those that depend on &quot;cerebral ruts&quot; (hardware) and those that dance more freely through the brain and so are able to function like &quot;software&quot;; Calvin usually calls these &quot;firing patterns&quot;.

In his research monograph &quot;The Cerebral Code&quot;, Calvin suggests that the pattern of action potentials in any particular neocortical minicolumn can be replicated and spread through the cortex like a piece of software code and be &quot;played&quot; on the millions of other minicolumns in the same way one can play a million copies of a compact disc (CD) on a million CD players – the key difference being that while all CD players are designed to do basically the same task, the various cortical minicolumns can all have their own unique &quot;ruts&quot; and the copies of the firing patterns are not exact duplicates.

This allows for a &quot;cerebral symphony&quot; rather than just a million-fold amplification of the same tune and a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; process whereby those firing patterns that resonate best with the existing pool of &quot;ruts&quot; will dominate one&#x27;s consciousness and generate intelligent behavior (&quot;Our long train of connected thoughts is why our consciousness is so different from what came before.&quot;).

In writing about what mind will become, in &quot;A Brief History of the Mind&quot; he notes, &quot;We will likely shift gears again, juggling more concepts and making decisions even faster, imagining courses of action in greater depth. Ethics are possible only because of a human level of ability to speculate, judge quality, and modify our possible actions accordingly.&quot;

William H. Calvin has advanced the view that use of the Acheulean hand axe in hominids was a major factor in the evolution in human intelligence.

<text>The Río de la Plata (; ), also called the River Plate or La Plata River in English, is the estuary formed by the confluence of the Uruguay River and the Paraná River at Punta Gorda. It empties into the Atlantic Ocean and forms a funnel-shaped indentation on the southeastern coastline of South America. Depending on the geographer, the Río de la Plata may be considered a river, an estuary, a gulf, or a marginal sea. If considered a river, it is the widest in the world, with a maximum width of .
The river is about long and widens from about at its source to about at its mouth. It forms part of the border between Argentina and Uruguay. The name Río de la Plata is also used to refer to the populations along the estuary, especially the main port cities of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, where Rioplatense Spanish is spoken and tango culture developed. The coasts of the river are the most densely populated areas of Uruguay and Argentina.

==Geography==
The Río de la Plata begins at the confluence of the Uruguay and Paraná rivers at Punta Gorda and flows eastward into the South Atlantic Ocean. No clear physical boundary marks the river&#x27;s eastern end; the International Hydrographic Organization defines the eastern boundary of the Río de la Plata as &quot;a line joining Punta del Este, Uruguay and Cabo San Antonio, Argentina&quot;.

Though it is generally spoken of as a river, the Río de la Plata is considered by some geographers to be a large bay or marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean. For those who regard it as a river, it is the widest in the world, with a maximum width of about and a total surface area of about .

===Islands and shoals===
The upper river contains several islands, including Oyarvide Island and the Solís Islands in Argentine waters and Juncal Island, Islote el Matón, Martín García Island and Timoteo Domínguez Island in Uruguayan waters. Because of deposition of sediments from the heavy stream load carried down from the river&#x27;s tributaries, the islands in the Río de la Plata generally grow over time.

A submerged shoal, the Barra del Indio, divides the Río de la Plata into an inner freshwater riverine portion and an outer brackish estuarine portion. The shoal is located approximately between Montevideo and Punta Piedras (the northwest end of Samborombón Bay). The inner fluvial zone is about long and up to wide, with a depth which varies from about ; the depth of the outer estuary zone increases from . The river&#x27;s discharge is strong enough to prevent saltwater from penetrating to the inner portion.

==Hydrology==
The Río de la Plata behaves as an estuary in which freshwater and seawater mix. The freshwater comes principally from the Paraná River (one of the world&#x27;s longest rivers and La Plata&#x27;s main tributary) as well as from the Uruguay River and other smaller streams. Currents in the Río de la Plata are dominated by tides reaching to its sources and beyond, into the Uruguay and Paraná rivers. Both rivers are tidally influenced for about . The tidal ranges in the Río de la Plata are small, but its great width allows for a tidal prism important enough to dominate the flow regime despite the huge discharge received from the tributary rivers.

The river is a salt wedge estuary in which saltwater, being denser than freshwater, penetrates into the estuary in a layer below the freshwater, which floats on the surface. Salinity fronts, or haloclines, form at the bottom and on the surface, where fresh and brackish waters meet. The salinity fronts are also pycnoclines due to the water density discontinuities. They play an important role in the reproductive processes of fish species.

===Drainage basin===

The Río de la Plata&#x27;s drainage basin (sometimes called the Platine basin or Platine region) is the - hydrographical area that drains to the Río de la Plata. It includes areas of southeastern Bolivia, southern and central Brazil, the entire country of Paraguay, most of Uruguay, and northern Argentina. Making up about one fourth of the continent&#x27;s surface, it is the second largest drainage basin in South America (after the Amazon basin) and one of the largest in the world.

===Tributaries===

The main rivers of the La Plata basin are the Paraná River, the Paraguay River (the Paraná&#x27;s main tributary), and the Uruguay River.

The Paraná River&#x27;s main tributaries include the Paranaíba River, Grande River, Tietê River, Paranapanema River, Iguazu River, Paraguay River, and the Salado River, after which it ends in the large Paraná Delta. The Paraguay River flows through the Pantanal wetland, after which its main tributaries include the Pilcomayo River and the Bermejo River, before it ends in the Paraná. The Uruguay&#x27;s main tributaries include the Pelotas River, Canoas River, Ibicuí River, and the Río Negro. Another significant tributary to the Río de la Plata is the Salado del Sur River.

==History==
===Indigenous people===
Nomadic aboriginal people inhabited the Río de la Plata region for thousands of years before European settlers arrived, and their descendants continue to live in the region to this day.

===European exploration===
The Río de la Plata was first explored by the Portuguese in 1512–13. The Spanish first explored it in 1516, when the navigator Juan Díaz de Solís traversed it during his search for a passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, calling it the Mar Dulce, or &quot;freshwater sea&quot;. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan briefly explored the estuary in 1520 before his expedition continued its circumnavigation, and in 1521, Cristóvão Jacques also explored the Plate River estuary and ascended the Parana River for the first time, entering it for about to near the present city of Rosario.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johson/Silva&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Explorer Sebastian Cabot made a detailed study of the river and its tributaries and gave it its modern name. He explored the Paraná and Uruguay rivers between 1526 and 1529, ascending the Paraná as far as the present-day city of Asunción, and also explored up the Paraguay River. Cabot acquired silver trinkets trading with the Guaraní near today&#x27;s Asunción, and these objects (together with legends of a &quot;Sierra de la Plata&quot; in the South American interior brought back by earlier explorers) inspired him to rename the river &quot;Río de la Plata&quot; (&quot;River of Silver&quot;).

The first European colony was the city of Buenos Aires, founded by Pedro de Mendoza on 2 February 1536. This settlement, however, was quickly abandoned; the failure to establish a settlement on the estuary led to explorations upriver and the founding of Asunción in 1537. The area was visited by Francis Drake&#x27;s fleet in early 1578, in the early stages of his circumnavigation. Buenos Aires was re-founded by Juan de Garay on 11 June 1580.

===Colonial period===

During the colonial era, the Río de la Plata was made the center of the Governorate of the Río de la Plata. The Río de la Plata region, particularly Buenos Aires, was a significant site of trade throughout the 17th century. The Crown initially intended Buenos Aires to be a military establishment for the protection of the Potosí mines, but it soon became evident that a settlement large enough to provide military defense would attract trade. The primary export was silver from the mines of Potosí, and imports generally included European luxury goods, slaves, and sugar. This trade occurred outside of the fleet system authorized by the Spanish Crown, and therefore was generally considered &quot;illicit.&quot; However, under the monarchy of the Spanish Habsburgs, the line between licit and illicit trade was quite blurry. Crown officials and military outposts in Buenos Aires often relied upon profits from illicit trade to support their administrative structures.

Under the Bourbon monarchy, the governorate was elevated to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776. This occurred as a result of the Bourbon Reforms, which attempted to restore the decaying wealth of the Spanish Crown. The reforms elevated the status of trade along the Río de la Plata and expanded what constituted &quot;legal&quot; trade so that the Crown could tax trade which had previously been &quot;contraband.&quot; However, the plan did not go as intended. Although trade along the Río de la Plata flourished, very little silver was actually remitted to the Crown. Then, Spanish war with Britain and the simultaneous eruption of revolts in the mining regions of Peru led to a shortage of silver, putting strain on the merchant class of Buenos Aires. This caused a schism between merchants who wanted to try to continue reviving the Spanish Empire through silver trade and those who wanted to move on from silver and prioritize agricultural exports, ultimately tearing at the fabric of the Río de la Plata region&#x27;s relationship with the Spanish Empire.

In 1806 and 1807 the river was the scene of an important British invasion that aimed to occupy the area and was defeated by the local garrison and population.

===Revolutionary period===
Conflict in the region intensified after the independence of the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies in the first quarter of the 19th century. Interests in the territories and the navigation rights over the Platine region played a major role in many armed conflicts throughout the century, including the Argentine civil wars, the Cisplatine and Platine wars, and the Paraguayan War. The river was blockaded by Brazil from 1826 to 1828, by the French from 1838 to 1840 and by an Anglo-French alliance from 1845 to 1850.

===Cisplatine War===
During the Cisplatine War, the Río de la Plata was blockaded by the Imperial Brazilian Navy, aiming to cripple Argentine finances and resupply their positions in Colonia del Sacramento and Montevideo. Squadrons of the newly independent United Provinces of the River Plate, led by the Irish-Argentine admiral William Brown attempted to break the blockade despite numerical inferiority.

====Battle of Punta Colares (1826)====

In the first major naval engagement of the war, an Argentine squadron left port in the early hours of February 9 to challenge the blockade. The battle was inconclusive, with the Argentine fleet breaking contact and the Brazilian admiral failing to give chase.

====Battle of Quilmes (1826)====

In July 29, a Brazilian fleet led by the English admiral James Norton engaged Brown&#x27;s fleet near Ensenada. Norton split his force, catching the Argentine line between two fires and causing significant casualties. William Brown&#x27;s flagship, the frigate &quot;25 de Mayo&quot;, sank after the battle as a result of the damage received.

====Battle of Juncal (1827)====

In 8–9 February, an Argentine fleet led by Brown engaged the Third Division of the Imperial Navy on the Uruguay River, inflicting heavy casualties against a disorganized Brazilian squadron. The Argentines routed the Third Division, capturing or destroying fifteen Brazilian vessels whilst losing none and frustrating the Brazilian attempt to control the Uruguay river.

====Battle of Monte Santiago (1827)====

Near the coast of Ensenada in April 7, four Argentine vessels led by Brown slipped out of port in an unsuccessful attempt to surprise a large Brazilian fleet under the command of Norton. Two brigs were sunk, and a schooner was heavily damaged, resulting in a decisive Brazilian victory that ensured the Imperial blockade of the Río de la Plata until the Preliminary Peace Convention of 1828.

The blockade caused serious problems to the export-oriented economy of Buenos Aires but indirectly contributed to rural provinces such as Córdoba, allowing producers to sell native products to Buenos Aires at an increased price.

===World War II===

====Battle of the River Plate (1939)====

In the first naval battle of the Second World War the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was engaged by the Royal Navy (RN) cruisers and , and the Royal New Zealand Navy cruiser , off the estuary of the River Plate in December 1939. The German ship retired up the estuary with a crippled fuel system and put into port at Montevideo. A few days later, rather than fight when believing himself outgunned, her captain scuttled her in the estuary. This engagement was part of the early Battle of the Atlantic.

==English names==
The historical English name &quot;River Plate&quot; uses an obsolete sense of the word &quot;plate&quot;, which was used extensively as a term for &quot;silver&quot; or &quot;gold&quot; from the 12th century onwards, especially in Early Modern English. The estuary has been known as the &quot;River Plate&quot; or &quot;Plate River&quot; in English since at least the time of Francis Drake. This English version of the name served as an inspiration for one of Argentina&#x27;s most important football clubs, Club Atlético River Plate.

A more literal translation of the name is &quot;Silver River&quot;, though this is virtually never used in practice.

==Fauna==
The Río de la Plata is a habitat for the loggerhead sea turtle, green sea turtle, leatherback sea turtle, the rare La Plata dolphin, and many species of fish.

<text>Joan Apsley (1578 – 14 December 1599), the maiden name of Joan Boyle, was the first wife of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork.

She was one of two daughters and co-heirs of William Apsley, of Limerick, one of the council to the first President of the province of Munster. Joan was the heiress of lands in Galbally, with a fortune greater than that of Richard Boyle. Joan was said to have been &quot;charmed by Mr. Boyle&#x27;s conversation,&quot; and her father allowed them to marry. She married Boyle at Limerick on 6 November 1595, she being 17 and he 28. This marriage brought her husband an estate worth £500 a year, &quot;the beginning and foundation of my fortune&quot;, which he continued to receive until at least 1632.

She died during childbirth aged 21 in Mallow, Ireland and was buried with her still-born son in Buttevant church, County Cork, Ireland. Boyle&#x27;s detractors maintained that unlike many of his other close relatives whom he took great care to commemorate, Richard took no trouble to have Joan, his first wife commemorated after her death. Boyle commemorated Joan in the south chapel, known as the Chantry of our Blessed Saviour, of St. Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church in Youghal, which he purchased in 1606 to make it into a mortuary chapel for his family. This tomb, completed in 1619, depicts Joan kneeling at her husband&#x27;s feet dressed in &quot;a richly brocaded purple gown.&quot; This led to the conviction among some that his monumental commemorative endeavours were motivated by how they could help achieve his personal objectives, rather than sentimental, as Joan&#x27;s connections were of no direct use to him after her death.

His strongest commemoration of Joan might be in the name he gave his fourth daughter but this may of course have been given in memory of his mother.

<text>The Humber Forts are two large fortifications in the mouth of the Humber Estuary in northern England: Bull Sand Fort () and Haile Sand Fort ().

==History==
The two forts were planned in 1914, at the start of the First World War, to protect the sea entrance to the Humber Estuary. They stand above the water and have a diameter of . There was accommodation for 200 soldiers. Started in May 1915, they took more than four years to build and construction was not finished until December 1919, a year after the war ended.

During the Second World War the forts were reactivated and modernised. They were regularly attacked by enemy aircraft. During this time, they installed submerged netting to prevent enemy submarines from travelling up the estuary to Hull or Grimsby. The forts were finally abandoned by the military in 1956.

===Bull Sand Fort===
Bull Sand Fort is from shore off Spurn Head. It is a 4-storey concrete building with of armour on the seaward side, and originally armed with four 6-inch guns. It was built with great difficulty as its sandbank is below low water.

In 1987 it was given a Grade II Listed Building status. In 1997 it was sold to the Streetwise Charitable Trust, who intended to restore the fort for use as a drug rehabilitation facility. The plan failed eventually. The trust no longer operates. Administratively, it is within the East Riding of Yorkshire and civil parish of Easington.

In July 2022, it was listed for sale by auction, with a guide price of £50,000, through Savills estate agents. The fort was sold for £490,000.

===Haile Sand Fort===
Haile Sand Fort or Sand Haile Fort is the smaller of the two and is situated around the low-water mark between Cleethorpes and Humberston on the Lincolnshire coast.

In February 2016 the fort was put on the market. It remained unsold until it was put up for auction in October 2018. It was sold for £117,000 at the auction to an unnamed purchaser.

<doc id="193537" wikidata="Q57246" url="?curid=193537" title="Hermann Minkowski">
<text>Hermann Minkowski ( ; ; 22 June 1864 – 12 January 1909) was a mathematician and professor at the University of Königsberg, the University of Zürich, and the University of Göttingen, described variously as German, Polish, Lithuanian-German, or Russian. He created and developed the geometry of numbers and elements of convex geometry, and used geometrical methods to solve problems in number theory, mathematical physics, and the theory of relativity.

Minkowski is perhaps best known for his foundational work describing space and time as a four-dimensional space, now known as &quot;Minkowski spacetime&quot;, which facilitated geometric interpretations of Albert Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity (1905).

==Personal life and family==
Hermann Minkowski was born in the town of Aleksota, the Suwałki Governorate, the Kingdom of Poland, since 1864 part of the Russian Empire, to Lewin Boruch Minkowski, a merchant who subsidized the building of the choral synagogue in Kovno, and Rachel Taubmann, both of Jewish descent. Hermann was a younger brother of the medical researcher Oskar (born 1858). In different sources Minkowski&#x27;s nationality is variously given as German, Polish, or Lithuanian-German, or Russian.

To escape Jewish persecution in the Russian Empire, the family moved to Königsberg in 1872, where the father became involved in rag export and later in manufacture of mechanical clockwork tin toys (he operated his firm Lewin Minkowski &amp; Son with his eldest son Max).

Minkowski studied in Königsberg and taught in Bonn (1887–1894), Königsberg (1894–1896) and Zürich (1896–1902), and finally in Göttingen from 1902 until his death in 1909. He married Auguste Adler in 1897 with whom he had two daughters; the electrical engineer and inventor Reinhold Rudenberg was his son-in-law.

Minkowski died of appendicitis in Göttingen on 12 January 1909. Max Born delivered the obituary on behalf of the mathematics students at Göttingen. David Hilbert&#x27;s obituary of Minkowski illustrates the deep friendship between the two mathematicians:
The main-belt asteroid 12493 Minkowski and M-matrices are named in Minkowski&#x27;s honor.

==Education and career==
Minkowski was educated in East Prussia at the &quot;Albertina&quot; University of Königsberg, where he earned his doctorate in 1885 under the direction of Ferdinand von Lindemann. In 1883, while still a student at Königsberg, he was awarded the Mathematics Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for his manuscript on the theory of quadratic forms. Due to the very young age of 18, which was unheard of in the mathematics community, and his obscurity as a mathematician at the time, his sharing the award with eminent English mathematician Henry Smith (who was certainly a great deal more famous than Hermann and to whom the prize was awarded posthumously) caused severe unrest among English mathematicians. The prize committee, despite the numerous complaints, never changed their decision. He also became a friend of another renowned mathematician, David Hilbert. His brother, Oskar Minkowski (1858–1931), was a well-known physician and researcher.

Minkowski taught at the universities of Bonn, Königsberg, Zürich, and Göttingen. At the &quot;Eidgenössische Polytechnikum&quot;, today the ETH Zurich, he was one of Einstein&#x27;s teachers.

Minkowski explored the arithmetic of quadratic forms, especially concerning &quot;n&quot; variables, and his research into that topic led him to consider certain geometric properties in a space of &quot;n&quot; dimensions. In 1896, he presented his &quot;geometry of numbers&quot;, a geometrical method that solved problems in number theory. He is also the creator of the Minkowski Sausage and the Minkowski cover of a curve.

In 1902, he joined the Mathematics Department of Göttingen and became a close colleague of David Hilbert, whom he first met at university in Königsberg. Constantin Carathéodory was one of his students there.

==Work on relativity==
By 1908 Minkowski realized that the special theory of relativity, introduced by his former student Albert Einstein in 1905 and based on the previous work of Lorentz and Poincaré, could best be understood in a four-dimensional space, since known as the &quot;Minkowski spacetime&quot;, in which time and space are not separated entities but intermingled in a four-dimensional space–time, and in which the Lorentz geometry of special relativity can be effectively represented using the invariant interval formula_1 (see History of special relativity).

The mathematical basis of Minkowski space can also be found in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space already known in the 19th century, because isometries (or motions) in hyperbolic space can be related to Lorentz transformations, which included contributions of Wilhelm Killing (1880, 1885), Henri Poincaré (1881), Homersham Cox (1881), Alexander Macfarlane (1894) and others (see History of Lorentz transformations).

The beginning part of his address called &quot;Space and Time&quot; delivered at the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (21 September 1908) is now famous:

<doc id="193539" wikidata="Q459553" url="?curid=193539" title="Chetumal">
<text>Chetumal (, , ; , ) is a city on the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. It is the capital of the state of Quintana Roo and the municipal seat of the Municipality of Othón P. Blanco. In 2020 it had a population of 169,028 people.

The city is situated on the western side of Chetumal Bay, near the mouth of the Río Hondo. Chetumal is an important port for the region and operates as Mexico&#x27;s main trading gateway with the neighboring country of Belize. Goods are transported via a road connecting Chetumal with Belize City to the south, and also via coastal merchant ships. There is a commercial airport, Chetumal International Airport, with airline service. Because of its location on the Caribbean coastline, it is vulnerable to tropical cyclones; Hurricane Janet and Hurricane Dean, both Category 5 storms, made landfall near Chetumal in 1955 and 2007 respectively.

==History==
In Pre-Columbian times, a city called Chactemal (sometimes rendered as &quot;Chetumal&quot; in early European sources), probably today&#x27;s Santa Rita in Belize, was the capital of a Maya state of the same name that roughly controlled the southern quarter of modern Quintana Roo and the northeast portion of Belize. This original Chetumal is now believed to have been on the other side of the Río Hondo, in modern Belize, not at the site of modern Chetumal.

During the Spanish conquest of Yucatán, the Maya state of Chetumal fought off several Spanish expeditions before finally being subjugated in the late 16th century.

The 1840s revolt of the indigenous Maya people against Mexican rule, known as the Caste War of Yucatán, drove all the Hispanic people from this region; many settled in Corozal Town, British Honduras (modern Belize).

The current site of Chetumal was established as a Mexican port town in 1898, originally under the name Payo Obispo. At the invitation of founder Othon P. Blanco, the early town was populated by settlers from Belize (including Caste War refugees and Englishmen).

The name of the town was officially changed to Chetumal in 1936.

Two hurricanes in the 1940s leveled the entire town; Chetumal was devastated a third time in 1955 by Hurricane Janet. After this, the town was rebuilt with more solid construction, with concrete blocks replacing wood as the usual material.

The population of Chetumal was small (about 5,000 in 1950) until the construction of highways linking it to the rest of Mexico in the 1960s and 1970s; the city then boomed with substantial migration from other parts of Mexico.

===Foundation===
The government of Porfirio Díaz decided to end the Maya revolt situation, resolving to fight the rebel Maya and to achieve this it definitively established the boundaries with British Honduras at the Rio Hondo, according to a treaty signed in 1893, also separated the new one from the state of Yucatan Federal Territory of Quintana Roo and sent the army to fight the Maya.

The first step in combating them was to prevent the trafficking of arms from Belize and to assert Mexican sovereignty at that end of the territory, so it was decided to build a fort and customs section at the point where the Hondo River feeds into Chetumal Bay, which they named Payo Obispo in honor of Payo Enríquez de Rivera, who as bishop of Guatemala had visited the region in the 1660s. An officer of the navy, Othón P. Blanco, suggested that as it was an unexplored place and without any certainty of what the terrain would be like, it would be better to send to the place a pontoon then anchored at the point of the bay or the Hondo River, which could serve as a barracks and customs section while a permanent establishment was being achieved, as the pontoon would allow for rapid mobility and increased surveillance. Blanco&#x27;s suggestion was accepted and he was also appointed command of such pontoon and chief of the operation; the pontoon was built in New Orleans and Blanco gave it the name Pontón Chetumal, in memory of the Maya name for the region. He left New Orleans in late 1897 and, after making stops in Progreso, Yucatan and Cozumel, arrived at the mouth of the Hondo River on 22 January 1898.

Othón P. Blanco quickly organized the garrison and ordered the clearing of the coast, covered with mangrove, to establish a permanent population on the mainland, and also came into contact with Mexicans residing in Corozal and survivors of the Bacalar massacre and communicated their intentions to establish a new population, inviting them to return to Mexico.

Finally, Othón P. Blanco officially founded the new town, on 5 May 1898, with neighbors from Corozal and other parts of the peninsula and gave it the name &quot;Payo Obispo&quot;&#x27;, as the region was already known. On the origin of this name it is mentioned that it comes from Fray Payo Enríquez de Rivera, who was Archbishop of Mexico and Viceroy of New Spain, but that when he was Bishop of Guatemala he came to pay a visit to Bacalar, landing at the point that received his name.

===Early years===
Payo Obispo was in the beginning a small border town, mainly dedicated to border surveillance and whose economic activities were concentrated on the exploitation of jungle resources such as Manilkara zapota and chicle, communication with the interior was only by sea, to the port of Vigía Chico, where a railway linked with the capital of the territory, Santa Cruz de Bravo, or further north Cozumel or Progress.

The houses were woodland Caribbean English style, as in Belize or Jamaica, built above ground level and painted brightly and with wooden latticework on the windows. Drinking water was collected from the rain through cisterns, of which each house used to have one, although a large public cistern was later built.

===Development===

The final development of Payo Obispo occurred when the governor of Yucatan, Salvador Alvarado decided to return to the Maya the city of Santa Cruz de Bravo, which at that time belonged to Yucatan after the suppression of the Territory of Quintana Roo and that by being 1915 the capital was moved accordingly to Payo Obispo, thereby increasing population and economic activity, as government units were established in the population.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the exploration and development of Quintana Roo was greatly disseminated, as it was one of the last undeveloped places in the country and many considered it conducive to the establishment of the new models advocated by the Mexican Revolution, however, on the grounds of financial reasons, the federal government once again abolished the Quintana Roo Territory and divided it between Yucatan and Campeche, with Payo Obispo being left in the latter state, Payo Obispo then led the movement that demanded the restoration of federal territory, a request answered by Lázaro Cárdenas, who visited the city in 1934 as a candidate for president and who once had taken office, re-established the territory in 1935.

The new governor, Rafael E. Melgar, greatly promoted the development of the city, he is due the construction of the first concrete buildings, these being the Government Palace, the Morelos Hospital and the Belisario Domínguez School, also developed promoting the establishment of worker cooperatives dedicated to logging, rubber and chewing gum, among other products and which motivated the start of emigration to Quintana Roo, promoted in addition to increasing population of the territory. In addition, and according to the postulates of the time, Melgar decided to remove all names of religious origin to the towns and cities of the territory, being renamed Payo Obispo according to decree of 16 February 1937 with the new name of Chetumal. The development promoted by Melgar declined to a greater or lesser extent during the following governments and for various reasons, but the growth of the city continued to increase.
On 27 September 1955, the Category 5 Hurricane Janet struck the city, destroying it almost completely. Most wooden buildings were destroyed and around 500 inhabitants perished. After the hurricane, Chetumal was rebuilt as a modern city, leaving behind its Anglo-Caribbean wooden architecture.

During the governments of Aarón Merino Fernández, Javier Rojo Gómez and David Gustavo Gutiérrez, the development continued to establish electric light, paving and terrestrial communications, as well as a large emigration from other parts of the country, promoted by the federal government, especially that of Luis Echeverría Álvarez, with the intention of promoting the Federal Territory in state of the Federation, which was finally made on October 8 of 1974, becoming Chetumal in the capital of the new Quintana Roo state.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Chetumal has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;), with a pronounced wet season from May to October, and a dry season from November to April.

==Contemporary Chetumal==
Chetumal is a growing city with an international airport. The city has a Museum of Maya Culture as well as a zoo, the Payo Obispo Zoo, which belongs to the children of Quintana Roo.

Chetumal&#x27;s economy has been influenced by its proximity to the border with Belize. A goods and services tax-free zone (Corozal Free Zone) established on the Belizean side attracts many visitors to Chetumal and also provides a ready market for Chetumal&#x27;s retailers and traders. However, a certain vacuum was created by the lower free zone prices forcing many Chetumal retailers to close their doors. Merchandise bought elsewhere was hard to sell at higher prices than the competition. Chetumal itself was also once a free zone and a notable destination for people from other parts of Mexico seeking to purchase high-value and bulk goods, free of government duty charges (a policy that was deliberately implemented to attract this business). The city retains a significant retail trade for the region, which supports many local businesses.
A large indoor mall, the Plaza de las Américas, houses a modern movie theater (which belongs to the Mexican chain Cinepolis), various department store chains, fast-food outlets, and a Chedraui supermarket.

In addition to its retail economy, Chetumal is also the capital of the state of Quintana Roo. Since it is the location of all of the state&#x27;s central offices, there is a large population of government employees whose consumption of local goods and services injects additional revenue into the Chetumal economy. As Capital of the state, Chetumal receives a good share of the foreign currencies brought in by the considerable floating population composed of European, Asian and North American tourists.

The city has a music school which offers lessons of various instruments as well as music theory and history. The school is the main music school of the state and is the home of the Junior symphonic orchestra of the state Quintana Roo (&quot;Orquesta sinfonica juvenil del estado de Quintana Roo&quot;) which is directed by Silvia Alcantara Chavero.

The city houses two theaters. The &quot;Teatro Minerva&quot;, which is an open-air theater and belongs to the state&#x27;s music school, and the &quot;Teatro Constituyentes&quot;, which is a private-owned theater.

There is a Country club, which features tennis, football and basketball courts, a gym, a swimming pool, a steam-bath and a lounge for parties.

In the early 1990s, the University of Quintana Roo was established at Chetumal, providing training and advanced tertiary degrees over a range of subjects.

<text>Sōtō Zen or is the largest of the three traditional sects of Zen in Japanese Buddhism (the others being Rinzai and Ōbaku). It is the Japanese line of the Chinese Cáodòng school, which was founded during the Tang dynasty by Dòngshān Liángjiè. It emphasizes Shikantaza, meditation with no objects, anchors, or content. The meditator strives to be aware of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference.

The Japanese brand of the sect was imported in the 13th century by Dōgen Zenji, who studied Cáodòng Buddhism () abroad in China. Dōgen is remembered today as the ancestor of Sōtō Zen in Japan along with Keizan Jōkin.

With about 14,000 temples, Sōtō is one of the largest Japanese Buddhist organizations. Sōtō Zen is now also popular in the West, and in 1996 priests of the Sōtō Zen tradition formed the Soto Zen Buddhist Association based in North America.

==History==

===Chinese origins===
The original Chinese version of Sōtō-shū, i.e. the Caodong-school (曹洞宗) was established by the Tang dynasty monk Dongshan Liangjie (洞山良价 Ja: Tōzan Ryōkai) in the ninth century.

One prevalent view is that the sect&#x27;s name was originally formed by taking one character each from the names of Dongshan and his disciple Caoshan Benji (曹山本寂, &quot;Tōzan Ryōkai&quot;), and was originally called Dongcao sect (with the characters in transposed order). However, to paraphrase the &quot;Dongshan Yulu&quot; (《洞山語録》, &quot;Record of the Dialogues of Dongshan&quot;), the sect&#x27;s name denotes &#x27;colleagues (曹) of the teachings above the caves (洞)&#x27; who together follow the &quot;black wind (teachings of Taoism?)&quot; and admire the masters of various sects.

Perhaps more significantly for the Japanese brand of this sect, Dōgen among others advocated the reinterpretation that the &quot;Cao&quot; represents not Caoshan, but rather &quot;Huineng of Caoxi temple&quot; ; zh:曹溪慧能). The branch that was founded by Caoshan died off, and Dōgen was a student of the other branch that survived in China.

A precursor to the sect is Shítóu Xīqiān (Ch. 石頭希遷, ca.700 – ca.790), the attributed author of the poem Sandokai, which formed the basis of Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi of Dongshan Liangjie (Jp. Tōzan Ryōkai) and the teaching of the Five Ranks.

===Kamakura (1185–1333)===
Starting with Dōgen, a partial lineage chart is as follows:





====Dōgen====
The Caodong-teachings were brought to Japan in 1227, when Dōgen returned to Japan after studying Ch&#x27;an in China and settled at Kennin-ji in Kyoto. Dōgen had received Dharma transmission from Tiantong Rujing at Qìngdé Temple, where Hongzhi Zhengjue once was abbot. Hongzhi&#x27;s writings on &quot;silent illumination&quot; had greatly influenced Dōgen&#x27;s own conception of shikantaza.

Dōgen did return from China with various kōan anthologies and other texts, contributing to the transmission of the koan tradition to Japan. In the first works he wrote he emphasised the practice of zazen, which brought him into trouble at Kennin-ji:
In 1243 Dōgen founded Eihei-ji, one of the two head temples of Sōtō-shū today, choosing...
Daily routine was copied from Chinese practices, which went back to the Indian tradition:
====Ejō====

Dōgen was succeeded around 1236 by his disciple Koun Ejō (1198–1280), who originally was a member of the Daruma school of Nōnin, but joined Dōgen in 1229. Ejō started his Buddhist studies at Mount Hiei, the center of Tendai studies. Following his stay there he studied Pure Land Buddhism under Shōkū, whereafter he joined the Daruma school of Nōnin by then led by Kakuan., and later Dōgen&#x27;s community in 1234.

Ejō composed a journal in colloquial Japanese called the , or simply &quot;Zuimonki&quot; for short, recollecting conversations he had with Dōgen. The recorded conversations emphasize the primacy of an austere Zen Buddhism, and resisted efforts from outside to incorporate other practices such as building Buddhist statues, or erecting new temples, and contrast with a different journal, the , an apocraphyl journal attributed to Gikai.

====Gikai====
A large group from the Daruma-school under the leadership of Ekan joined the Dogen-school in 1241, after severe conflicts with the Tendai and Rinzai schools. Among this group were Gikai, Gien and Giin, who were to become influential members of Dōgen&#x27;s school.

After the death of Ejō, a controversy called the &quot;sandai sōron&quot; occurred. In 1267 Ejō retired as Abbot of Eihei-ji, giving way to Gikai, who was already favored by Dogen. Gikai too originally was a member of the Daruma school, but joined Dōgen&#x27;s school in 1241, together with a group from the Nōnin school led by Ekan. Gikai introduced esoteric elements into the practice:

Opposition arose, and in 1272 Ejō resumed the position of abbot. After his death in 1280, Gikai became abbot again, strengthened by the support of the military for magical practices. Opposition arose again, and Gikai was forced to leave Eihei-ji, and exiled to Kaga Province, Daijō-ji (in Ishikawa Prefecture). He was succeeded by Gien, who was first trained in the Daruma-school of Nōnin. His supporters designated him as the third abbot, rejecting the legitimacy of Gikai.

====Keizan====

The second most important figure in Sōtō, Keizan, belonged to this dissident branch. Keizan received ordination from Ejō when he was, twelve years old, shortly before Ejō&#x27;s death When he was seventeen he went on a pilgrimage for three years throughout Japan. During this period, he studied Rinzai, Shingon and Tendai. After returning to Daijō-ji, Keizan received dharma transmission from Gikai in 1294, and established Joman-ji. In 1303 Gikai appointed Keizan as abbot of Daijō-ji, a position he maintained until 1311.

Keizan enlarged the Shingon-temple Yōkō-ji in Ishikawa prefecture, turning it into a Zen monastery in 1312. Thereafter he inherited the Shingon temple Shogaku-ji in 1322, renaming it Sōji-ji, which was recognized as an official monastery. In 1324 he put Gasan Jōseki in charge of Sojo-ji, and returned to Yōkō-ji. Yōko-ji was Keizan&#x27;s main temple, but Sōji-ji thrived better, thanks to Gasan Jōseki

Though today Dōgen is referred as the founder of Sōtō, for a long period Sōtō history recognized several important ancestors, next to Dōgen. In 1877 the heads of the Sōtō community acknowledged Keizan for a brief period as the overall founder of the Sōtō sect.

Dogen is known as the &quot;koso&quot;, where Keizan is known as the &quot;taiso&quot;;
====Sōtō centers====
At the end of the Kamakura period, Dōgen&#x27;s school centered around four centers, namely Eihei-ji, Daijo-ji monastery, and the temples Yoko-ji and Sōji-ji. Sōji-ji became the most influential center of the Dōgen school.

===Muromachi (or Ashikaga) (1336–1573)===
During the Muromachi period the Rinzai school was the most successful of the schools, since it was favoured by the &quot;shōgun&quot;. But Soto too spread out over Japan.

====Gasan and Sotetsu====
Gasan Jōseki (1275–1365) and Meiho Sotetsu were Keizan&#x27;s most prominent students.

Gasan too started his Buddhist studies at mount Hiei. He became head of Soji-ji in 1324. Gasan adopted the Five Ranks of Tung-shan as a fit vehicle to explain the Mahayana teachings.

Sotetsu became head of Yoko-ji in 1325. Initially his influence soon grew. In 1337 Sotetsu was appointed as abbot of Daijo-ji.

===Azuchi-Momoyama (1573–1600) and Edo (or Tokugawa) (1600–1868)===
After a period of war Japan was re-united in the Azuchi–Momoyama period. Neo-Confucianism gained influence at the expense of Buddhism, which came under strict state control. The power of Buddhism decreased during the Tokugawa period. Buddhism had become a strong political and military force in Japan and was seen as a threat by the ruling clan. Measures were taken to control the Buddhist organisations, and to limit their power and influence. The temple hierarchy system was centralized and unified.

Japan closed the gates to the rest of the world. New doctrines and methods were not to be introduced, nor were new temples and schools. The only exception was the Ōbaku lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the Edo period by Ingen, a Chinese monk. The presence of these Chinese monks also influenced the existing Zen-schools, spreading new ideas about monastic discipline and the rules for dharma transmission.

The Sōtō school started to place a growing emphasis on textual authority. In 1615 the bakufu declared that &quot;Eheiji&#x27;s standards (&quot;kakun&quot;) must be the rule for all Sōtō monks&quot;. In time this came to mean all the writings of Dōgen, which thereby became the normative source for the doctrines and organisation of the Sōtō school.

A key factor in this growing emphasis on Dogen was Manzan&#x27;s appeal to change the rules for dharma transmission, based on arguments derived from the Shōbōgenzō. From its beginnings, Sōtō-shū has laid a strong emphasis on the right lineage and dharma transmission. In time, dharma transmission became synonymous with the transmission of temple ownership. When an abbot changed position, becoming abbot of another temple, he also had to discard his lineage and adopt the lineage of his new temple. This was changed by Manzan Dokahu (1636–1714), a Sōtō reformer, who ...
Dōgen scholarship came to a central position in the Sōtō sect with the writings of Menzan Zuihō (1683–1769), who wrote over a hundred works, including many commentaries on Dōgen&#x27;s major texts and analysis of his doctrines. Menzan promoted reforms of monastic regulations and practice, based on his reading of Dōgen.

Another reformation was implemented by Gentō Sokuchū (1729–1807), the 11th abbot of Eihei-ji, who tried to purify the Sōtō school, de-emphasizing the use of kōans. In the Middle Ages kōan study was widely practiced in the Sōtō school. Gentō Sokuchū started the elevation of Dōgen to the status he has nowadays, when he implemented new regulations, based on Dōgen&#x27;s regulations.

This growing status of Dōgen as textual authority also posed a problem for the Sōtō school:
===Meiji Restoration (1868–1912) and Imperial expansionism===
During the Meiji period (1868–1912) Japan abandoned its feudal system and opened up to Western modernism. Shinto became the state religion, and Buddhism was coerced to adapt to the new regime. Rinzai and Sōtō Zen chose to adapt, with embarrassing consequences when Japanese nationalism was endorsed by the Zen institutions. War endeavours against Russia, China and finally during the Pacific War were supported by the Zen establishment.

Within the Buddhist establishment the Western world was seen as a threat, but also as a challenge to stand up to. Parties within the Zen establishment sought to modernize Zen in accord with Western insights, while simultaneously maintaining a Japanese identity.

During this period a reappraisal of Dōgen started. The memory of Dōgen was used to ensure Eihei-ji&#x27;s central place in the Sōtō organisation, and &quot;to cement closer ties with lay people&quot;. In 1899 the first lay ordination ceremony was organized in Eihei-ji. Eihei-ji also promoted the study of Dōgen&#x27;s works, especially the Shōbōgenzō, which changed the view of Dōgen in Sōtō&#x27;s history. An image of Dōgen was created that suited the specific interests of Eihei-ji:
===Lay interests===
Funerals continue to play an important role as a point of contact between the monks and the laity. Statistics published by the Sōtō school state that 80 percent of Sōtō laymen visit their temple only for reasons having to do with funerals and death, while only 17 percent visit for spiritual reasons and a mere 3 percent visit a Zen priest at a time of personal trouble or crisis.

===Monastic training===
In a piece of advice to western practitioners, Kojun Kishigami Osho, a dharma heir of Kōdō Sawaki, writes:
According to Kishigami, practice may as well be undertaken elsewhere:

==Spread in the western world==
In the 20th century Sōtō Zen spread out to the west.

===Shunryū Suzuki===

Shunryū Suzuki played a central role in bringing Sōtō to the west. Suzuki studied at Komazawa University, the Sōtō Zen university in Tokyo. In 1959 Suzuki arrived in California to attend to Soko-ji, at that time the sole Sōtō temple in San Francisco. His book &quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; has become a classic in western Zen culture. Suzuki&#x27;s teaching of Shikantaza and Zen practice led to the formation of the San Francisco Zen Center, one of the largest and most successful Zen organizations in the West. The training monastery of the San Francisco Zen center, at Tassajara Hot Springs in central California, was the first Buddhist Monastery to be established outside Asia. Today SFZC includes Tassajara Monastery, Green Gulch Farm, and City Center. Various Zen Centers around the U.S. are part of the dharma lineage of San Francisco Zen Center and maintain close organizational ties with it.

Suzuki&#x27;s assistant Dainin Katagiri was invited to come to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he moved in 1972 after Suzuki&#x27;s death. Katagiri and his students built four Sōtō Zen centers within Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

===Sanbo Kyodan===

The Sanbo Kyodan is a lay Zen sect with elements of both the Soto and the Rinzai traditions started by Haku&#x27;un Yasutani, and later Kōun Yamada. It was renamed Sanbo-Zen International in 2014.

In Europe the Sanbo Kyodan has been influential via Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle, and via students of disgraced Zen monk Dennis Genpo Merzel, especially in the Netherlands.

===Antai-ji===

The Antaiji-based lineage of Kōdō Sawaki is also widespread. Sawaki&#x27;s student and successor as abbot Kōshō Uchiyama was the teacher of Shōhaku Okumura who established the Sanshin Zen Community in Bloomington, Indiana, and his student Gudō Wafu Nishijima was Brad Warner&#x27;s teacher. Another of Sawaki&#x27;s students, Taisen Deshimaru, travelled to France where he became Kaikyosokan (head of Japanese Soto Zen for a particular country or continent) in Europe. Deshimaru founded the Association Zen Internationale in 1970, which is now the oldest and largest Zen association in Europe, with affiliated sanghas in France, Spain, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and other countries.

===Soto Zen Buddhist Association===
The larger majority of North American Sōtō priests joined in 1996 to form the Soto Zen Buddhist Association. While institutionally independent of the Japanese Sōtōshū, the Sōtō Zen Buddhist Association works closely with what most members see as their parent organization. With about one hundred fully transmitted priests, the Sōtō Zen Buddhist Association now represents about 80% of Western Sōtō teachers. The Soto Zen Buddhist Association approved a document honoring the women ancestors in the Zen tradition at its biannual meeting on October 8, 2010. Female ancestors, dating back 2,500 years from India, China, and Japan, may now be included in the curriculum, ritual, and training offered to Western Zen students.

==Practice==
Daily services in Sōtō monasteries include chanting of sutras and dharanis.

===Shikantaza===
In the Sōtō school of Zen, Shikantaza, meditation with no objects, anchors, or content, is the primary form of practice. The meditator strives to be aware of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference.

Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found throughout Dōgen&#x27;s works:
Other important texts promoting zazen are the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;, and the &quot;Principles of Zazen&quot; and the &quot;Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen&quot;.

===Sōtō versus Rinzai===
Sōtō Zen was often given the derogatory name &quot;farmer Zen&quot; because of its mass appeal. Some teachers of Zen would say that it was called &quot;farmer Zen&quot; because of its down-to-earth approach, while the Rinzai school was often called &quot;samurai Zen&quot; because of the larger samurai following. The latter term for the Rinzai can be somewhat misleading, however, as the Sōtō school also had samurai among its rosters.

==Texts==

===Sutras===
Sōtō Zen, like all of Zen, relies on the Prajnaparamita Sutras, as well as general Mahayana Buddhist sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra, the Brahma Net Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra. Zen is influenced in large part by the Yogacara school of philosophy as well as the Huayan school.

Until the promotion of Dogen studies in modern times, the study of Chinese texts was prevalent in Sōtō:
=== Sōtō Zen texts ===
Shih-t&#x27;ou Hsi-ch&#x27;ien&#x27;s (Shitou Xiqien, Sekito Kisen, 700–790) poem &quot;The Harmony of Difference and Sameness&quot; is an important early expression of Zen Buddhism and is chanted in Sōtō temples to this day.

One of the poems of Tung-shan Liang-chieh, the founder of Sōtō, &quot;The Song of the Jewel Mirror Awareness&quot; is also chanted in Sōtō temples. Another set of his poems on the Five Positions (Five Ranks) of Absolute and Relative is important as a set of kōans in the Rinzai school.

Other texts typically chanted in Sōtō Zen temples include the Heart Sutra (Hannyashingyō), and Dōgen&#x27;s Fukanzazengi (Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen).

====Dōgen====
Dōgen&#x27;s teaching is characterized by the identification of practice as enlightenment itself. This is to be found in the Shōbōgenzō. The popularity of this huge body of texts is from a relatively recent date:
The study of Dōgen, and especially his Shobogenzo, has become the norm in the 20th century:
==Organisation==

The Sōtō-shū organisation has an elaborate organisation. It consists of about 15,000 temples. There are circa 30 training centers, where Sōtō monks can train to become an oshō or priest and run their own temple.

===Head and parliament===
Sōtō-shu has a centralised organisation, run by a head:
===Temples===
Contemporary Sōtō-shū has four classes of temples:
# , head temples, namely Eihei-ji and Sōji-ji;
# &quot;Kakuchi&quot;, teaching monasteries, where at least once a year an &quot;ango&quot; (ninety-day retreat) takes place;
# &quot;Hōchi&quot;, dharma temples;
# &quot;Jun hōchi&quot;, ordinary temples.

While Eihei-ji owes its existence to Dōgen, throughout history this head temple has had significantly fewer sub-temple affiliates than the Sōji-ji. During the Tokugawa period, Eiheiji had approximately 1,300 affiliate temples compared to Sōji-ji&#x27;s 16,200. Furthermore, out of the more than 14,000 temples of the Sōtō sect today, 13,850 of those identify themselves as affiliates of Sōji-ji. Additionally, most of the some 148 temples that are affiliates of Eiheiji today are only minor temples located in Hokkaido—founded during a period of colonization during the Meiji period. Therefore, it is often said that Eiheiji is a head temple only in the sense that it is head of all Sōtō dharma lineages.

===Legal status===
The Sōtū-shū is an &quot;umbrella (hokatsu) organization for affiliated temples and organizations&quot;. It has &quot;three sets of governing documents&quot;:
# Sōtōshū Constitution (Sotoshu shuken);
# Regulations for the Religious Juridical Person Sōtōshu (Shūkyō hōnin Sōtōshū kisoku);
# Sōtōshū Standard Procedures (Sōtōshū kitei).
