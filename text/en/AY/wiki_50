<text>Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), known professionally as 50 Cent, is an American rapper, actor, and television producer. Born in South Jamaica, a neighborhood of Queens, Jackson began pursuing a musical career in 1996. In 1999–2000, he recorded his debut album &quot;Power of the Dollar&quot; for Columbia Records; however, he was struck by nine bullets during a shooting in May 2000, causing its release to be cancelled and Jackson to be dropped from the label. His 2002 mixtape, &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Back?&quot;, was discovered by Detroit rapper Eminem, who signed Jackson to his label Shady Records, an imprint of Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records that same year.

His debut studio album, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; (2003), was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. Peaking atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one singles &quot;In da Club&quot; and &quot;21 Questions&quot; (featuring Nate Dogg), and received nonuple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). That same year, he launched the record label G-Unit Records, namesake of a hip hop group he formed two years prior; the label&#x27;s initial signees were its members, fellow East Coast rappers Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. His second album, &quot;The Massacre&quot; (2005), was met with similar success and supported by his third number-one single, &quot;Candy Shop&quot; (featuring Olivia). He adopted a lighter, further commercially oriented approach for his third and fourth albums, &quot;Curtis&quot; (2007) and &quot;Before I Self Destruct&quot; (2009)—both were met with critical and commercial declines—and aimed for a return to his roots with his fifth album, &quot;Animal Ambition&quot; (2014), which was met with mixed reviews. He has since focused on his career in television and media, having executive-produced and starred in the television series &quot;Power&quot; (2014–2020), as well as its numerous spin-offs under his company G-Unit Films and Television Inc.

Jackson has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and earned several accolades, including a Grammy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, thirteen &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards. In his acting career, Jackson first starred in the semi-autobiographical film &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; (2005), which was critically panned. He was also cast in the war film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; (2006), and the crime thriller &quot;Righteous Kill&quot; (2008). &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Jackson as 17th on their &quot;50 Greatest Rappers&quot; list in 2023, and named him the sixth top artist of the 2000s decade. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&quot;&#x27; and &quot;In da Club&quot; in its lists of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the 2000s&quot; and &quot;100 Best Songs of the 2000s&quot; at numbers 37 and 13, respectively.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in the borough of Queens, New York City, and raised in its South Jamaica neighborhood by his mother Sabrina. Sabrina, a drug dealer, raised Jackson until she died in a fire when Jackson was eight years old. Jackson revealed in an interview that his mother was a lesbian. After his mother&#x27;s death and his father&#x27;s departure, Jackson was raised by his grandparents.

He began boxing at about age 11, and when he was 14, a neighbor opened a boxing gym for local youth. &quot;When I wasn&#x27;t killing time in school, I was sparring in the gym or selling crack on the strip,&quot; Jackson remembered. He sold crack during primary school. &quot;I was competitive in the ring and hip-hop is competitive too ... I think rappers condition themselves like boxers, so they all kind of feel like they&#x27;re the champ.&quot;

At age 12, Jackson began dealing narcotics when his grandparents thought he was in after-school programs, and brought guns and drug money to school. In the tenth grade, he was caught by metal detectors at Andrew Jackson High School: &quot;I was embarrassed that I got arrested like that ... After I got arrested I stopped hiding it. I was telling my grandmother [openly], &#x27;I sell drugs.

On June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine, and a starting pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp and earned his GED. He has said that he did not use cocaine himself. Jackson adopted the nickname &quot;50 Cent&quot; as a metaphor for change. The name was inspired by Kelvin Martin, a 1980s Brooklyn robber known as &quot;50 Cent&quot;; Jackson chose it &quot;because it says everything I want it to say. I&#x27;m the same kind of person 50 Cent was. I provide for myself by any means.&quot;

==Career==
===1996–2002: Rise to fame, shooting, and early mixtapes===
Jackson began rapping in a friend&#x27;s basement, where he used turntables to record over instrumentals. In 1996, a friend introduced him to Jam Master Jay of Run-DMC, who was establishing Jam Master Jay Records. Jay taught him how to count bars, write choruses, structure songs, and make records. Jackson&#x27;s first appearance was on &quot;React&quot; with Onyx, for their 1998 album &quot;Shut &#x27;Em Down&quot;. He credited Jam Master Jay for improving his ability to write hooks, and Jay produced Jackson&#x27;s first (unreleased) album. In 1999, after Jackson left Jam Master Jay, the platinum-selling producers Trackmasters signed him to Columbia Records. They sent him to an upstate New York studio, where he produced 36 songs in two weeks; 18 were included on his 2000 album, &quot;Power of the Dollar&quot;. Jackson founded Hollow Point Entertainment with former G-Unit member Bang &#x27;Em Smurf.

Jackson&#x27;s popularity began to grow after the successful, controversial underground single &quot;How to Rob&quot;, which he wrote in a half-hour car ride to a studio. The track comically describes how he would rob famous artists. Jackson explained the song&#x27;s rationale: &quot;There&#x27;s a hundred artists on that label, you gotta separate yourself from that group and make yourself relevant.&quot; Rappers Jay-Z, Kurupt, Sticky Fingaz, Big Pun, Wyclef Jean, and the Wu-Tang Clan responded to the track, and Nas invited Jackson to join him on his &quot;Nastradamus&quot; tour. Although &quot;How to Rob&quot; was intended to be released with &quot;Thug Love&quot; (with Destiny&#x27;s Child), two days before he was scheduled to film the &quot;Thug Love&quot; music video, Jackson was shot and hospitalized.

On May 24, 2000, Jackson was attacked by a gunman outside his grandmother&#x27;s former home in South Jamaica. After getting into a friend&#x27;s car, he was asked to return to the house to get some jewelry; his son was in the house, and his grandmother was in the front yard. Jackson returned to the back seat of the car, and another car pulled up nearby; an assailant walked up and fired nine shots at close range with a 9mm handgun. Jackson was shot in the hand, arm, hip, both legs, chest, and left cheek. His facial wound resulted in a swollen tongue, the loss of a wisdom tooth and a slightly slurred voice; his friend was wounded in the hand. They were driven to a hospital, where Jackson spent 13 days. The alleged attacker, Darryl &quot;Homicide&quot; Baum, Mike Tyson&#x27;s close friend and bodyguard, was killed three weeks later.

Jackson recalled the shooting: &quot;It happens so fast that you don&#x27;t even get a chance to shoot back ... I was scared the whole time ... I was looking in the rear-view mirror like, &#x27;Oh shit, somebody shot me in the face! It burns, burns, burns.&#x27;&quot; In his autobiography, &quot;From Pieces to Weight: Once upon a Time in Southside Queens&quot;, he wrote: &quot;After I got shot nine times at close range and didn&#x27;t die, I started to think that I must have a purpose in life ... How much more damage could that shell have done? Give me an inch in this direction or that one, and I&#x27;m gone.&quot; Jackson used a walker for six weeks and fully recovered after five months. When he left the hospital, he stayed in the Poconos with his girlfriend and son, and his workout regime helped him develop a muscular physique.

In the hospital, Jackson signed a publishing deal with Columbia Records before he was dropped from the label and blacklisted by the recording industry because of his song, &quot;Ghetto Qu&#x27;ran&quot;. Unable to work in a U.S. studio, he went to Canada. With business partner Sha Money XL, Jackson recorded over thirty songs for mixtapes to build a reputation. In a HitQuarters interview, Marc Labelle of Shady Records A&amp;R said that Jackson used the mixtape circuit to his advantage: &quot;He took all the hottest beats from every artist and flipped them with better hooks. They then got into all the markets on the mixtapes and all the mixtape DJs were messing with them.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s popularity increased, and in 2002 he released the mixtape &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Back?&quot;. He then released &quot;50 Cent Is the Future&quot; backed by G-Unit, a mixtape revisiting material by Jay-Z and Raphael Saadiq.

===2002–2007: Mainstream breakthrough, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&quot;&#x27;, and &quot;The Massacre&quot;===
In 2002, Eminem heard Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Back?&quot; album, received from Jackson&#x27;s attorney (who was working with Eminem&#x27;s manager, Paul Rosenberg). Impressed, Eminem invited Jackson to fly to Los Angeles and introduced him to Dr. Dre. After signing a $1 million record deal, Jackson released &quot;No Mercy, No Fear&quot;. The mixtape featured one new track, &quot;Wanksta&quot;, which appeared on Eminem&#x27;s &quot;8 Mile&quot; soundtrack. Jackson was also signed by Violator Management and Sha Money XL&#x27;s Money Management Group.

50 Cent released his debut album, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; (described by AllMusic as &quot;probably the most hyped debut album by a rap artist in about a decade&quot;), in February 2003. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted its &quot;dark synth grooves, buzzy keyboards and a persistently funky bounce&quot;, with Jackson complementing the production in &quot;an unflappable, laid-back flow&quot;. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 872,000 copies in its first four days. The lead single, &quot;In da Club&quot; (noted by &quot;The Source&quot; for its &quot;blaring horns, funky organs, guitar riffs and sparse hand claps&quot;), set a &quot;Billboard&quot; record as the most listened-to song in radio history within a week.
Interscope began funding and distributing for Jackson&#x27;s label, G-Unit Records, in 2003. He signed Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck as members of G-Unit, and The Game was later signed in a joint venture with Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Entertainment. G-Unit Records replaced Jackson&#x27;s previous imprint, Rotten Apple Entertainment. 50 Cent executive produced Lloyd Banks&#x27;s June 2004 debut studio album, &quot;The Hunger for More&quot;, which achieved Platinum status in America. 50 Cent also contributed vocals to Lloyd Banks&#x27;s hit single, &quot;On Fire&quot;. In March 2005, 50 Cent&#x27;s second commercial album, &quot;The Massacre&quot;, sold 1.14 million copies in its first four days (the highest in an abbreviated sales cycle) and was number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for six weeks. He was the first solo artist with three singles in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top five in the same week with &quot;Candy Shop&quot;, &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; and &quot;How We Do&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;50&#x27;s secret weapon is his singing voice - the deceptively amateur-sounding tenor croon that he deploys on almost every chorus&quot;. 50 Cent&#x27;s video game, &quot;50 Cent: Bulletproof&quot; was released in November 2005. 50 Cent portrays himself and provides his likeness and voice in the video game, with the video game also featuring music from his first two studio albums.

After The Game&#x27;s departure Jackson signed Olivia and rap veterans Mobb Deep to G-Unit Records, with Spider Loc, M.O.P., 40 Glocc and Young Hot Rod later joining the label, who all eventually departed the label. Jackson expressed an interest in working with rappers other than G-Unit, such as Lil&#x27; Scrappy of BME, LL Cool J of Def Jam, Mase of Bad Boy and Freeway of Roc-A-Fella, and recorded with several.

===2007–2010: &quot;Curtis&quot;, sales battle with Kanye West, and &quot;Before I Self Destruct&quot;===
In September 2007, 50 Cent released his third album, &quot;Curtis&quot;, which was inspired by his life before &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&quot;&#x27;. It debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 691,000 copies during its first week. It sold behind Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Graduation&quot;, released the same day; the outcome of this highly-publicized sales battle between Jackson and West has been accredited to the commercial decline of the gangsta rap and &quot;bling era&quot; style that previously dominated mainstream hip-hop.

On the September 10, 2008, episode of &quot;Total Request Live,&quot; Jackson said his fourth studio album, &quot;Before I Self Destruct&quot;, would be &quot;done and released in November&quot;. He released &quot;Ok, You&#x27;re Right&quot;, produced by Dr. Dre for &quot;Before I Self Destruct&quot;, on May 18, 2009, and was scheduled to appear in a fall 2009 episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;. On September 3, 2009, Jackson posted a video for the Soundkillers&#x27; Phoenix- produced track, &quot;Flight 187&quot;, introducing his mixtape and book (&quot;The 50th Law&quot;). The song, with lyrics inspiring speculation about tension between Jackson and Jay-Z, was a bonus track on the iTunes version of &quot;Before I Self Destruct&quot;. &quot;Before I Self Destruct&quot; was released on November 9, 2009 and debuted at number 5 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, giving 50 Cent his fourth consecutive top 5 album in the U.S.

===2010–2015: New musical directions, new business ventures, and &quot;Animal Ambition&quot;===

In a Contactmusic.com interview, Jackson said he was working on a Eurodance album, &quot;Black Magic&quot;, inspired by European nightclubs: &quot;First they played hip-hop which suddenly changed to uptempo songs, known as Eurodance&quot;. He later said he had changed his next album to &quot;The Return of the Heartless Monster&quot; after writing different material when he returned home from the Invitation Tour in 2010, shelving &quot;Black Magic&quot;. On September 3, Jackson supported Eminem on his and Jay-Z&#x27;s The Home &amp; Home Tour, performing &quot;Crack A Bottle&quot; with Eminem and Dr. Dre amid rumors of tension between Jackson and Dre.

He &quot;recorded 20 songs to a whole different album concept&quot; before putting them aside, wanting his new album to have the &quot;aggression&quot; of &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin″&quot;. Jackson tweeted that the album was &quot;80 percent done&quot; and fans could expect it in the summer of 2011. It was ultimately delayed a year due to disagreements with Interscope Records, with Jackson saying that he would release it in November 2011 with a different title than &quot;Black Magic&quot;. Eminem would appear on the album, and Jackson said he was working with new producers such as Boi-1da and Alex da Kid. Cardiak, who produced Lloyd Banks&#x27; &quot;Start It Up&quot;, confirmed that he produced a song for the upcoming album.

Jackson released a song, &quot;Outlaw&quot;, from his fifth album on the Internet on June 16, 2011. The single, produced by Cardiak, was released on iTunes on July 19 (although Jackson tweeted that it was not the album&#x27;s first single). The rapper planned to write a semi-autobiographical young-adult novel about bullying, different from his previous books which focused on his life and the rules of power. According to the book&#x27;s publisher, the first-person novel (about a 13-year-old schoolyard bully &quot;who finds redemption as he faces what he&#x27;s done&quot;) was scheduled for publication in January 2012.

In a series of tweets, Jackson said that the delay of his fifth album was due to disagreements with Interscope Records, later suggesting that it would be released in November 2011 with his headphone line (SMS by 50). He speculated to MTV News about not renewing his five-album contract with Interscope: &quot;I don&#x27;t know ... It will all be clear in the negotiations following me turning this actual album in. And, of course, the performance and how they actually treat the work will determine whether you still want to stay in that position or not.&quot;

On June 20, 2011, Jackson announced the release of &quot;Before I Self Destruct II&quot; after his fifth album. Although he planned to shoot a music video for the fifth album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I&#x27;m On It&quot;, on June 26 the video was never filmed. Jackson told Shade45, &quot;I did four songs in Detroit with Eminem. I did two with Just Blaze, a Boi-1da joint, and I did something with Alex da Kid. We made two that are definite singles and the other two are the kinds of records that we been making, more aimed at my core audience, more aggressive, more of a different kind of energy to it.&quot; He released &quot;Street King Energy Track #7&quot; in September 2011 to promote Street King, his charity-based energy drink. An announcement that Jackson was shooting a music video for &quot;Girls Go Wild&quot;, the fifth-album lead single featuring Jeremih, was made on September 28, 2011.

Jackson&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Street King Immortal&quot;, was initially scheduled for a summer 2012 release and postponed until November 13. Disagreements with Interscope Records about its release and promotion led to its temporary cancellation. Its first promo single, &quot;New Day&quot; with Dr. Dre and Alicia Keys, was released on July 27. The song was produced by Dr. Dre, mixed by Eminem and written by 50 Cent, Alicia Keys, Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; and Dr. Dre. A solo version by Keys was leaked by her husband, Swizz Beatz. &quot;My Life&quot;, the album&#x27;s second promo single (with Eminem and Maroon 5 lead singer Adam Levine), was released on November 26, 2012.

In January 2014, Jackson said he planned to release &quot;Animal Ambition&quot; in the first quarter of the year, followed by &quot;Street King Immortal&quot;. On February 20, he left Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope, signing with Caroline and Capitol Music Group. According to Jackson, although he owed Interscope another album, he was released from his contract because of his friendship with Eminem and Dr. Dre: &quot;I&#x27;m a special case and situation. It&#x27;s also because of the leverage of having the strong relationships with Eminem and Dr. Dre. They don&#x27;t want me to be uncomfortable. They value our friendship to the point that they would never want [to jeopardize] it over that little bit of money.&quot;

That day, he announced that &quot;Animal Ambition&quot; would be released on June 3 and released its first track. The song, &quot;Funeral&quot;, was released with a video on Forbes.com. Produced by Jake One, it is a continuation of &quot;50 Bars&quot; from a previous album; two more tracks were scheduled for release on March 18. At South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, Jackson performed &quot;Hold On&quot; from the new album. That song and &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry &#x27;Bout It&quot; were released with accompanying videos on March 18. According to Jackson, prosperity would be a theme of the album: &quot;This project, I had to search for a concept, a really good concept, in my perspective, and that was prosperity. I outlined all the things that would be a part of prosperity, positive and negative [for &quot;Animal Ambition&quot;].&quot;

&quot;Animal Ambition&quot; debuted at number four on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, giving 50 Cent his fifth consecutive top five album in the country, while also debuting at number one on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Independent Albums chart.

===2015–2021: &quot;Street King Immortal&quot;, bankruptcy, and departure from Interscope===

On May 14, 2015, Jackson revealed in an interview that the first single from &quot;Street King Immortal&quot;, would be previewed Memorial Day weekend and would likely be released in June. Jackson released &quot;Get Low&quot; on May 20, 2015, as the intended first single from his sixth studio album, &quot;Street King Immortal&quot;. The song, produced by Remo the Hitmaker, features vocals from fellow American rappers 2 Chainz and T.I., as well as American singer Jeremih. He announced bankruptcy on July 13, 2015.

On March 31, 2017, Interscope Records released 50 Cent&#x27;s final album for the label, a greatest hits album titled &quot;Best Of&quot;.

In 2020, Jackson led the executive-producer duties for late rapper Pop Smoke&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon&quot;, having been one of Pop Smoke&#x27;s biggest inspirations. The album was released on July 3, 2020. Jackson curated the album, desiring to finish it after Pop had died. He contacted many of the artists involved, and also features on one of the album tracks, &quot;The Woo&quot;. The Woo also features vocals from fellow American rapper Roddy Ricch.

In 2020, it was reported that Jackson was producing two television series for Starz, an anthology about hip hop and a biographical drama about sports agent Nicole Lynn.

In 2021, he became one of the headliners of the music festival &quot;Golden Sand&quot; in Riviera Maya.

In a July 2021 interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, 50 Cent confirmed that he had officially decided to shelve his &quot;Street King Immortal&quot; album after it spent a decade in development hell. He even confirmed that he plans to release a completely new project.

=== 2021–present: Focusing on acting and media production, Super Bowl LVI halftime show performance ===
In May 2021, Curtis Jackson moved to Houston. This was thought to be for lower taxes, no income tax, and for the rapper scene, as well as other ventures such as writing new screenplays. Also, Jackson, Horizon United Group, and Houston Independent School District began a partnership on a project that would help high school students learn the business skills that define successful entrepreneurship.
While living in Houston, Curtis Jackson was in the process of writing screenplays for new crime shows.

In August 2021, he was confirmed to be starring in the upcoming &quot;Expend4bles&quot; film.

In September 2021, Starz released &quot;BMF&quot;, a series based on two brothers in Detroit who ran a drug trafficking and money laundering operation from the mid-1980s until 2005. Jackson is the executive producer of the show, which is based on a true story.

On February 13, 2022, 50 Cent was a surprise performer in the Super Bowl LVI halftime show, receiving a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live) in September for the performance.

==Artistry==
Jackson cites Boogie Down Productions, Big Daddy Kane, The Juice Crew, EPMD and KRS-One as his rapping influences, while citing LL Cool J as an inspiration behind his writing of &quot;21 Questions&quot;. Jackson also states that he drew influences from Nas, Rakim and The Notorious B.I.G. while working on &quot;Animal Ambition&quot;.

==Business ventures==
Jackson has had a highly successful business career. He is financially invested in a highly diversified variety of industries. Jackson is now involved in artist and talent management, record, television, and film production, footwear, apparel, fragrances, liquor, video games, mobile apps, book publishing, headphones, along with health drinks and dietary supplements. His broad business and investment portfolio contains investments in a variety of sectors including real estate, financial market investments, mining, boxing promotion, vodka, fragrances, consumer electronics and fashion.

He established his own record label G-Unit Records in 2003 following his mainstream success. In November 2003, he signed a five-year deal with Reebok to distribute a G-Unit Sneakers line for his G-Unit Clothing Company. In an interview, Jackson said his businesses had a habit of doing well as he saw all of his ventures both past and present as revolving around his alter ego.

Jackson has also started a book publishing imprint, G-Unit Books on January 4, 2007, at the Time Warner Building in New York. He has written a number of books including a memoir, &quot;From Pieces To Weight&quot; in 2005 where it sold 73,000 copies in hardcover and 14,000 copies in paperback; a crime novel and a book with Robert Greene titled &quot;The 50th Law&quot;, an urban take on &quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot;. In November 2011, Jackson released 50 Cent&#x27;s Playground, a young adult fiction novel about a bullied, violent boy and his gay mother.

One of Jackson&#x27;s first business ventures was a partnership with Glacéau to create an enhanced water drink called Formula 50. In October 2004, Jackson became a beverage investor when he was given a minority share in the company in exchange for becoming a spokesperson after learning that he was a fan of the beverage. The health conscious Jackson noted that he first learned of the product while at a gym in Los Angeles, and stated that &quot;they do such a good job making water taste good&quot;. After becoming a minority shareholder and celebrity spokesperson, Jackson worked with the company to create a new grape flavored &quot;Formula 50&quot; variant of VitaminWater and mentioned the drinks in various songs and interviews. In 2007, Coca-Cola purchased Glacéau for $4.1 billion and, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Jackson, who was a minority shareholder, earned $100 million from the deal after taxes.

Though he no longer has an equity stake in the company, Jackson continues to act as a spokesperson for VitaminWater, supporting the product including singing about it at the BET Awards and expressing his excitement over the company&#x27;s continuing to allow his input on products.
He joined Right Guard to introduce a body spray (Pure 50 RGX) and endorsed Magic Stick condoms, planning to donate part of their proceeds to increasing HIV awareness. Jackson signed a multi-year deal with Steiner Sports to sell his memorabilia, and announced plans for a dietary-supplement company in conjunction with his film &quot;Spectacular Regret&quot; in August 2007.
Jackson has founded two film production companies: G-Unit Films in 2003 and Cheetah Vision in 2008. Cheetah Vision produces low budget action thrillers for foreign film markets across the world. When G-Unit Films folded, he focused on Cheetah Vision and the company obtained $200 million in funding in 2010. In 2010, Jackson revived G-Unit Films, renaming the company to G-Unit Films and Television Inc. The company has joint ventures with Will Packer&#x27;s production company Will Packer Productions and Universal Television. In over 18 months, Jackson has sold projects to six different networks. Among them was &quot;Power&quot;, a STARZ drama in which he not only co-stars but also serves as co-creator and executive producer. &quot;Power&quot; debuted in June 2014 and was renewed for a second season after one episode.

Jackson serves as a co-star, co-creator and executive television producer of the STARZ network drama where he signed a 2-year contract with representation coming from the Agency for the Performing Arts. Ratings have been a success for Starz. with the second-season premiere being the highest-ever season with 1.43 million people tuning in live. &quot;Power&quot; ended in 2020. Jackson is the executive producer of three of its spin-offs, &quot;PowerBook II: Ghost,&quot; &quot;PowerBook III: Raising Kanan,&quot; and &quot;Powerbook IV: Force.&quot;

In 2002, Jackson filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to register the term &quot;50 Cent&quot; as a trademark for clothing, sound recordings, and live performances. The application was published in 2003, and registration issued in 2004. He has since filed for additional trademark registrations.

In July 2011, Jackson launched a philanthropic initiative to provide food for one billion starving people in Africa by 2016, joining Pure Growth Partners to introduce Street King. A portion of the proceeds from each Street King purchase would be used to provide a daily meal to an underprivileged child. The partnership coincides with Jackson&#x27;s goal to feed a billion people in Africa during the next five years. &quot;50 Cent and I share a common vision: to address the world&#x27;s problems through smart and sustainable business models,&quot; said Chris Clarke, founder and CEO of Pure Growth Partners. &quot;With the rampant starvation in Africa and hunger afflicting children worldwide, we need socially responsible businesses that affect real change now more than ever.&quot; Jackson said, &quot;I&#x27;m inspired by Clarke&#x27;s vision and innovative approaches to tackling serious issues. It&#x27;s our mission with Street King to really change children&#x27;s lives around the world.&quot; In 2011, he founded SMS Audio, a consumer-electronics company selling Street by 50 headphones, pledging to donate a portion of their sales to charity. In April 2015, SMS announced new co-branding deals with Reebok and Marvel. It added those to existing partnerships with Walt Disney Parks, Lucasfilm&#x27;s Star Wars, and Intel.

In 2014, Jackson became a minority shareholder in Effen Vodka, a brand of vodka produced in the Netherlands, when he invested undisclosed amount in the company Sire Spirits LLC. He currently endorses the product via his live concert performances and social media. The rapper was asked to take part in two promotional bottle signings, one in Oak Creek and another in Sun Prairie. Jackson made an appearance at Liquor Warehouse in Syracuse, New York on April 25, 2015, where he reportedly sold 1,400 bottles (277 gallons) of Jackson&#x27;s signature liquor brand. Liquor Warehouse&#x27;s owner George Angeloro reportedly stocked 300 cases (1,800 bottles or 357 gallons) of Effen Vodka, which sells for $30 a bottle, prior to the event.

In December 2014, Jackson signed a $78 million deal with FRIGO Revolution Wear, a luxury underwear brand. The joint venture is partnered between Jackson, basketball player Carmelo Anthony, baseball player Derek Jeter and Mathias Ingvarsson, the former president of mattress company Tempur-Pedic. Jackson became the chief fashion designer for the brands single pair of Frigo boxers. In April 2015, Jackson mulled investing in Jamaica, exploring foreign investment opportunities on the island when he met with some local officials and had ongoing discussions on investment opportunities in the Montego Bay resort area.

===Investments===
Over the years, Jackson invested his earnings from music and celebrity endorsements in an array of privately controlled companies, real estate, and stocks and bonds. A portion of his investments lost value during the 2008 recession. In December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had been affected by the recession, losing several million dollars in the stock market. Unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, Jackson postponed &quot;Before I Self-Destruct&quot; due to the severity of the economic downturn.

His Farmington mansion located on 50 Poplar Hill Drive that he tried to sell for years filed for bankruptcy in Connecticut in 2015 listed an asking price for that property in 2012 at $10 million but was valued at $8.3 million in 2015. He first tried to sell the house in 2007 for $18.5 million, and dropped the price several times in the next five years, when it was on and off the market.

In January 2011, Jackson reportedly made $10 million after using Twitter to promote a marketing company which he was part shareholder of. His endorsements company G Unit Brands Inc. revealed through a public SEC filing controls 12.9 per cent of H&amp;H Imports, which is a parent company of TV Goods – the firm responsible for marketing his range of headphones, Sleek by 50 Cent. Jackson bought stock in the company on November 30, 2010, a week after it offered buyers 180 million shares at 17 cents each. Jackson later made a stock recommendation on Twitter, causing its share value to rise from four cents to nearly 50 cents each, closing on Monday at 39 cents. Jackson was later investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for breaching securities laws following his tweet which may have constituted allegations of insider trading via his pump and dump stock investment strategy.

In 2013, Jackson became a minority investor in Hang w/, a live video broadcasting mobile app used by dozens of celebrities to broadcast their daily activities and chat with fans. The app was downloaded more than 1 million times since its launch in March 2013 and had more than 1 million users . Other minority celebrity investors include former NFL player Terrell Owens and record producer Timbaland.

===Mining and heavy metals===
In 2008, Jackson visited a platinum, palladium and iridium mine shaft in South Africa, and met with South African billionaire Patrice Motsepe in talks of purchasing an equity stake in the mine. After his meeting with Motsepe, Jackson considered purchasing equity in the mine and launching his own line of 50 Cent branded platinum.

===Boxing promotion===
On July 21, 2012, Jackson became a licensed boxing promoter when he formed his new company, TMT (The Money Team). Licensed to promote in New York, he was in the process of being licensed in Nevada (where most major fights are held in the U.S.). A former amateur boxer, Jackson signed gold medalist and former featherweight champion Yuriorkis Gamboa and middleweight Olympic medalist Andre Dirrell. On July 29, 2012, he and the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. signed IBF featherweight champion Billy Dib. They unveiled plans to challenge the box-office dominance of mixed martial arts and change the landscape of boxing with TMT Promotions. Boxer Zab Judah also expressed interest in making a deal with Jackson. In December 2012, Mayweather and Jackson parted company, with Jackson taking over the promotion company and founding SMS Promotions with Gamboa, Dirrell, Dib, James Kirkland, Luis Olivares and Donte Strayhorn in his stable.

====Bankruptcy====
On July 13, 2015, Jackson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut with a debt of $32,509,549.91. On July 17, 2015, the Court issued an order allowing a creditor to proceed with the punitive damages phase of a trial against Jackson in a New York state court, in connection with the alleged release of a private video. His assets were listed as between $10 million and $50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath that he is worth $4.4 million. He said that he had between $10 million and $50 million in debt, and the same amount in assets. Later in the week, Jackson&#x27;s bankruptcy lawyers elucidated through the court documents that legal fees and judgments exceeding $20 million over the past year were the primary cause of the filing.

His filings listed 32 entities that he had a stake in. The bankruptcy came days after a jury ordered him to pay $5 million to rapper Rick Ross&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Lastonia Leviston for invading her privacy by posting online a sex tape of her and another man. In addition, Jackson lost a dispute over a failed business deal involving his Sleek headphones, where Jackson invested more than $2 million. An ex-partner accused Jackson of later stealing the design of the &quot;Sleek by 50&quot; headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million. His Connecticut bankruptcy filing stated that he owned seven cars valued at more than $500,000, including a 2010 Rolls-Royce and a 1966 Chevrolet Coupe. His expenses of $108,000 a month included $5,000 for gardening. He reported a monthly income of $185,000, mainly from royalties and income from his external businesses and investments. The court filing said he also owed money to his stylist, his barber, and his fitness coach.

Other details in the bankruptcy documents included information about two deals that sold the right to collect royalties of on-air play of his music. Half the rights to his portfolio were sold to the British independent music publishing company Kobalt Music Group for $3 million and the other half for another $3 million with the sales of his albums allowing Jackson to own 100 percent of the rights to the master recordings while paying only for distribution. Zeisler &amp; Zeisler, a Bridgeport law firm, represented 50 Cent in the bankruptcy, which later resulted in Jackson filing a $75 million lawsuit against his own lawyers. He stated that his lawyers did a terrible job of representing him, specifically citing the fallout of his failed venture with Sleek Audio headphones. He accused Garvey Schubert Barer, a Wall Street law firm, of failing to &quot;employ the requisite knowledge and skill necessary to confront the circumstances of the case&quot;.

==Personal life==
50 Cent has said his life philosophy, following his shooting, is &quot;When your time comes, you go. I think that comes from God.&quot; Despite having numerous songs that reference drug and alcohol usage and his ownership of Branson Cognac, Jackson remains a teetotaler, citing a bad experience with alcohol as his main reason.

&quot;Forbes&quot; noted Jackson&#x27;s wealth in 2007, ranking him second behind Jay-Z in the rap industry. He lived in a Farmington, Connecticut, mansion formerly owned by ex-boxer Mike Tyson. Jackson listed the mansion for sale in 2007 at $18.5 million to move closer to his son (who lived on Long Island at the time). In 2019, the mansion was sold for $2.9 million, with $1 million being donated to tax-deducted charities.

The mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, declared October 12, 2007 &quot;50 Cent Curtis Jackson Day&quot;, honoring the rapper with a proclamation and a key to the city. One of Jackson&#x27;s New York homes, purchased in January 2007 for $2.4 million and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 31, 2008, while he was filming in Louisiana.

In December 2008, he told the Canadian press that he had lost several million dollars in the stock market and, unable to sell his Connecticut mansion, had postponed &quot;Before I Self-Destruct&quot; because of the economic downturn. Jackson won a lawsuit in November 2009 against Taco Bell over the fast-food chain&#x27;s use of his name without permission.

=== Family and relationships ===
On October 13, 1996, Jackson&#x27;s girlfriend, Shaniqua Tompkins, gave birth to son Marquise. Tompkins later sued Jackson for $50 million in 2009, saying he promised to take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it &quot;an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour&quot;. The two have bickered for years, and have even taken their feud to social media many times.

Marquise&#x27;s birth changed Jackson&#x27;s outlook on life: &quot;When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn&#x27;t have with my father.&quot; He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the &quot;motivation to go in a different direction&quot;. Despite this, the two have endured a fractured relationship that began when Jackson and Tompkins separated in 2008. Their feud has been taken to social media numerous times, including in 2020 when Jackson disclosed that he &quot;used to&quot; love his son. Jackson has a tattoo &quot;Marquise&quot; with an axe on his right biceps (&quot;The axe is &#x27;cause I&#x27;m a warrior. I don&#x27;t want him to be one, though&quot;), and has &quot;50&quot;, &quot;Southside&quot; and &quot;Cold World&quot; on his back: &quot;I&#x27;m a product of that environment. It&#x27;s on my back, though, so it&#x27;s all behind me&quot;.

In 2003, Jackson briefly dated actress Vivica A. Fox. He broke up with her only eight months later on the radio.

Jackson dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire Jackson, with her, on September 1, 2012. At the age of two years, Sire modeled for Kidz Safe, a headphone brand for kids, earning $700,000 through his contract.

In 2024, on a post on Instagram to promote his Cognac brand, Jackson stated that he had been practicing celibacy. Jackson stated: &quot;My new idea is so big, I don’t have time to be distracted I’m practicing abstinence, I have been meditating and focusing on my goals.&quot; Jackson further clarified his stance during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, stating, &quot;Listen, when you calm down you can focus...I’ve been good to me.&quot; In the same interview, Jackson also opened up about his decision to not marry, stating that, &quot;I&#x27;m safe. I’m not a happy hostage. I’m here. I’m free. I made some mistakes, just not that one...I want someone I can love in my life too, just not right now, I&#x27;m fine.&quot;

=== Political views ===
In 2005, Jackson supported President George W. Bush after rapper Kanye West criticized Bush for a slow response to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. If his felony convictions did not prevent him from voting, he said that he would have voted for the president. Jackson later said that Bush &quot;has less compassion than the average human. By all means, I don&#x27;t aspire to be like George Bush.&quot; In September 2007, he told &quot;Time&quot; that although he would not endorse a candidate in 2008, he &quot;liked Hillary [Clinton]&quot;.

Six months later, the rapper told MTV News that he had switched his support to Barack Obama after hearing him speak, but had lost interest in politics. Asked his opinion of President Obama&#x27;s May 9, 2012, endorsement of gay marriage, Jackson said, &quot;I&#x27;m for it ... I&#x27;ve encouraged same-sex activities. I&#x27;ve engaged in fetish areas a couple times.&quot; He had been criticized for anti-gay comments in the past.

Jackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He rejected an offer of $500,000 from the Trump campaign to make an appearance on the candidate&#x27;s behalf. However, he endorsed Donald Trump in 2020, due to his dislike of Joe Biden&#x27;s tax plans. A week later, he retracted his endorsement, saying on Twitter &quot;Fuck Donald Trump, I never liked him&quot;, and endorsed Biden.

===Legal issues===
On June 29, 1994, Jackson was arrested for selling four vials of cocaine to an undercover police officer. He was arrested again three weeks later, when police searched his home and found heroin, ten ounces of crack cocaine and a starter&#x27;s pistol. Although Jackson was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, he served six months in a boot camp (where he earned his high-school equivalency diploma). According to him, he did not use cocaine.

Jackson and four members of his entourage were arrested shortly before 2 a.m. on December 31, 2002, when police found a .25-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber pistol in a parked car (which they searched due to its tinted windows) outside a Manhattan nightclub. The rapper was charged with two counts of criminal possession of a weapon.

Jackson was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation on July 22, 2005, for a May 2004 incident, when he was charged with three counts of assault and battery after jumping into an audience when he was hit by a water bottle.

===Lawsuits===

====Use of image====
Jackson filed a lawsuit against an advertising company, Traffix of Pearl River, New York, on July 21, 2007, for using his image in a promotion he said threatened his safety. He was alerted by a staff member to an Internet advertisement on a Myspace page. According to court documents, the advertisement had a cartoon image of the rapper with &quot;Shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed&quot;. Although the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly resembled him and suggested that he endorsed the product. The lawsuit, calling the ad a &quot;vile, tasteless and despicable&quot; use of Jackson&#x27;s image which &quot;quite literally call[ed] for violence against him&quot;, sought unspecified punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the use of his image without permission.

====Use of name====
In 2008, Jackson sued Taco Bell over an ad campaign in which it invited him to change his name for one day from 50 Cent to 79 Cent, 89 Cent, or 99 Cent, in line with pricing for some of its items, and they would donate $10,000 to the charity of his choice. The case was settled out of court.

====Janitor incident====
While walking through Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in May 2016, Jackson harassed and insulted a janitor at the airport, accusing him of being under the influence. The janitor was a hearing-impaired, autistic teenager named Andrew Farrell. The parents of the janitor had seen the viral video as disrespect and wanted to sue Jackson for his action against their child. The lawsuit was originally over one million dollars, but the parents settled for a $100,000 donation to Autism Speaks and his apology.

====Bamba sample====
In 2016, a judge declared that Brandon Parrott gave Dr. Dre and 50 Cent the rights to &quot;Bamba&quot; for the song &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot;

=== Other civil and criminal matters ===
One of his New York homes, purchased for $2.4 million in January 2007 and the center of a lawsuit between Jackson and Shaniqua Tompkins, caught fire on May 30, 2008, while he was filming in Louisiana. On August 5, 2013, Jackson pleaded not guilty to one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism in a Los Angeles County court. If convicted of all charges, he faced up to five years in prison and a $46,000 fine. Model-actress Daphne Joy accused Jackson of kicking her and ransacking her bedroom during an argument at her condominium in the Toluca Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles on June 23. He allegedly caused $7,100 in property damage, leaving the scene before police arrived.

Judge Ann Nevins has ordered Jackson back to court because of Instagram messages he made over several months. She said Jackson was not fully clear about his funds and indicated posts of the rapper showing stacks of his money. In March 2016, Jackson claimed that he would no longer use Instagram, electing instead to have his profile page operated by someone else.

In 2020, Jackson was a subject of controversy for his involvement in a viral video of him giving money to a Burger King restaurant in New York City on behalf of a local scammer who was later arrested and charged for Bitcoin scamming and for assaulting and kidnapping his victims on April 24, 2021.

==Feuds==

===Ja Rule===
Before he signed with Interscope Records, Jackson engaged in a public dispute with rapper Ja Rule and his label, Murder Inc. Records, saying that a friend robbed jewelry from Ja Rule and the latter accused him of orchestrating the robbery. Ja Rule said that the conflict stemmed from a Queens video shoot, when Jackson did not like seeing him &quot;getting so much love&quot; from the neighborhood. At The Hit Factory in New York in March 2000, Jackson had an altercation with Murder Inc. associates and received three stitches for a stab wound. Rapper Black Child claimed responsibility for the stabbing, saying that he acted in self-defense when he thought someone reached for a gun.

An affidavit by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent suggested ties between Murder Inc. and Kenneth &quot;Supreme&quot; McGriff, a New York drug lord suspected of involvement in the murder of Jam Master Jay and Jackson&#x27;s shooting. An excerpt read:

The end of the Jackson-Ja Rule feud was confirmed in May 2011. According to Ja Rule, &quot;I&#x27;m cool. We ain&#x27;t beefing no more. We&#x27;ll never collaborate. That&#x27;s just what it is. You don&#x27;t have to be at war with somebody, but it&#x27;s also kind of like U.S. and another country that they may not get along with. We don&#x27;t gotta go to war, but we&#x27;re not friends either. But we can coincide inside of a world. He&#x27;s doing him, and he&#x27;s not thinking about me, and I&#x27;m doing me and I&#x27;m not thinking about him.&quot;

On August 7, 2015, the feud between the two rappers later reignited when Ja Rule gave a feedback to a social follower via Twitter over a similar feud between Meek Mill and Drake. Enraged, Jackson later responded with photos and comments via Instagram, only siding with Drake. The feud resurfaced three years later on January 19, 2018, when Ja Rule took to Twitter, calling out 50 Cent on social media.

In October 2018, Jackson pranked Ja Rule by purchasing 200 discounted front-row tickets for an upcoming show of his in Arlington, Texas for a total of US$3,000 via Groupon, with Jackson later confirming on social media that he bought the tickets with the express intention of forcing Ja Rule to perform in front of rows of empty seats.

=== Jay-Z and Beyoncé ===
In 1999, with the release of the single &quot;How to Rob&quot;, 50 Cent attacked his rap peers, including Jay-Z, who responded to the provocation with the single &quot;It&#x27;s Hot (Some Like It Hot)&quot; in which he raps &quot;Go against Jigga yo ass is dense/I&#x27;m about a dollar – what the f*ck is 50 Cents?&quot;.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, 50 Cent accused Jay-Z and his record company Roc-A-Fella Records of being unfair to Beanie Sigel because &quot;[Jay-Z] didn&#x27;t have their interests in mind, he was just doing what he had to do for himself.&quot; The rapper also stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t know him personally, [...] I tried to collaborate with him on the Freeway project ... What I did was Freeway went out and found his publishing deal, and we started the album. [...] when it came time to put the record out, he didn&#x27;t want to shoot his video. He has a god complex.&quot; 50 Cent also accused Jay-Z of changing in attitude and image since marrying Beyoncé.

In 2017, 50 Cent described Jay-Z&#x27;s thirteenth studio album &quot;4:44&quot; as &quot;golf course music&quot; in a Instagram post, elaborating: &quot;I listened to Jay sh*t, that &quot;4:44&quot;. [...] [It] was too smart. I felt like I was supposed to be wearing like glasses and shit and like a tie, a fucking sweater around my waist. It was like Ivy League. They don&#x27;t wanna hear that shit. [...] They just wanna have a good time. You know what I&#x27;m saying? You can&#x27;t be the best rapper at 47 because the new n****s is here. They coming with new [music] going on.&quot; In an interview on the &quot;Conan Show&quot;, 50 Cent spoke about the album, saying: &quot;Hip-hop culture&#x27;s connected to youth culture. The kids gonna bring new innovative stuff. He just had the maturity bleed off into the material. [...] But the kids, I don&#x27;t see them actually listening to it&quot;.

In an interview in 2022, 50 Cent reported that in a meeting between him and the couple in Los Angeles, the two rappers were having a heated argument. Beyoncé, seeing them, jumped from a ledge to come to her husband&#x27;s defense. 50 Cent compared the singer to her sister Solange when she hit Jay-Z in the elevator, describing them as &quot;two gangstas&quot;.

In an interview for &quot;XXL Mag&quot; in 2023, 50 Cent claimed that Jay-Z&#x27;s Grammy wins were due to his marriage to Beyoncé: &quot;Even Jay-Z&#x27;s career, you can look at that and say the association to Beyoncé is when he started to receive the 16, 17 Grammys, since he&#x27;s been with Beyoncé. And you go, prior to that [he had] one. That came with the association.&quot; 50 Cent also pointed out that the couple&#x27;s eldest child Blue Ivy Carter won a Grammy even though she does not sing or rap, accusing award ceremonies of giving accolades to the couple just to ensure their attendance during the show. The rapper also reported that his non-win at the Grammys was due to his music being &quot;a little bit abrasive to conservatives; [...] It didn&#x27;t matter to me in that time period. Don&#x27;t give me the trophy. They didn&#x27;t give me Best New Artist and I sold 13 million records&quot;, while the Carter-Knowles family is more politically agreeable to the music industry.

=== Fat Joe ===
In connection to his feud with Ja Rule, 50 Cent also took aim at fellow New York rapper Fat Joe, a high-profile collaborator of Ja Rule&#x27;s. The feud took aim at Fat Joe following his 2002 track What&#x27;s Luv? featuring Ja Rule and Ashanti. Fat Joe had also continued his collaboration with Murder Inc. on his 2004 track &quot;New York&quot; featuring Jadakiss, prompting a diss track aimed at Fat Joe from 50 Cent on his 2005 album The Massacre entitled Piggy Bank. Fat Joe later responded with the track &quot;My Fofo&quot; on his album All or Nothing released later that same year. Tensions boiled over during the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards when Fat Joe presented the award for best Hip Hop Video, in which he told the audience &quot;I feel so safe tonight with all this police protection courtesy of G-Unit&quot;. 50 Cent later retaliated with a profanity-laden diatribe following his performance of the song So Seductive with fellow G-Unit artist Tony Yayo, exclaiming &quot;Fat Joe&#x27;s a pussy man! [...] Pussy Boy, Nigga What?!&quot;. The feud later affected Fat Joe financially as he sought to secure a $20 million contract endorsing Air Jordan sneakers in early 2005, Michael Jordan himself later cancelled the contract following the VMA incident as he was in fear of conflict with 50 Cent or any other affiliates. Following this; little action was taken on either side as the feud seemed to calm down by 2011. Murder Inc. executive Irv Gotti later expressed anger at Fat Joe following his proposal to quell their longstanding feud with G-Unit in 2010. In 2012, 50 Cent approached Fat Joe in talks of ending the feud following the two agreeing to perform at a memorial ceremony for then-recently deceased music executive Chris Lighty. Despite the prior history between the two, 50 Cent and Fat Joe became close friends and business associates shortly thereafter despite Fat Joe&#x27;s lengthy connections with Ja Rule.

===The Game===
Although Jackson was close to The Game before the latter released his debut album, &quot;The Documentary&quot;, they grew apart. After &quot;The Documentary&quot;″s release, Jackson felt that The Game was disloyal for saying that he did not want to participate in G-Unit&#x27;s feuds with other rappers (such as Nas, Jadakiss and Fat Joe) and his desire to work with artists with which G-Unit was feuding. He said that he wrote six songs for the album and did not receive proper credit, which The Game denied.
Jackson later dismissed The Game from G-Unit on Hot 97. After the announcement, The Game (a guest earlier in the evening) tried to enter the building with his entourage. After they were denied entry, one of his associates was shot in the leg in a confrontation with a group of men leaving the building. When the situation escalated, the rappers held a joint press conference announcing their reconciliation, and fans were uncertain if the rappers had staged a publicity stunt to boost sales of their recently released albums. After the situation cooled, G-Unit criticized The Game&#x27;s and announced that they would not appear on his albums. During a Summer Jam performance The Game announced a boycott of G-Unit, which he called &quot;G-Unot&quot;.

After the Summer Jam performance The Game recorded &quot;300 Bars and Runnin&#x27;&quot;, an extended &quot;diss&quot; of G-Unit and Roc-A-Fella Records, for the mixtape &quot;You Know What It Is Vol. 3&quot;. Jackson responded with his &quot;Piggy Bank&quot; music video, with The Game as Mr. Potato Head and parodies of other rivals. They have continued attacking each other, with The Game releasing two more mixtapes: &quot;Ghost Unit&quot; and a mixtape-DVD, &quot;Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin&quot;. Jackson superimposed The Game&#x27;s head on the body of a male stripper for the cover of the &quot;Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Radio Part 21)&quot; mixtape in response to The Game&#x27;s pictures of G-Unit dressed as the Village People. The Game, under contract to Aftermath Entertainment, signed with Geffen Records to terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit (although it is claimed that Jackson pressured Dr. Dre to fire him). G-Unit member Spider Loc has insulted The Game in songs, and the latter released &quot;240 Bars (Spider Joke)&quot; and &quot;100 Bars (The Funeral)&quot; attacking G-Unit and Loc. Jackson&#x27;s response was &quot;Not Rich, Still Lyin&#x27;&quot;, mocking The Game. Lloyd Banks replied to the Game on a &quot;Rap City&quot; freestyle-booth segment, followed by a Game &quot;diss&quot; song (&quot;SoundScan&quot;) ridiculing the 13-position drop of Banks&#x27; album &quot;Rotten Apple&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and its disappointing second-week sales. Banks replied on his mixtape &quot;Mo&#x27; Money In The Bank Pt. 5: Gang Green Season Continues&quot; with &quot;Showtime (The Game&#x27;s Over)&quot;, said that Jackson wrote half of &quot;The Documentary&quot; and ridiculed The Game&#x27;s suicidal thoughts.

In October 2006, The Game made a peace overture (which was not immediately answered) to Jackson, but two days later he said on Power 106 that the peace offer was valid for only one day. In several songs on &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, he implied that the feud was over. He said in July 2009 that the feud had ended with help from Michael Jackson and Diddy, and apologized for his actions. According to Tony Yayo, neither Jackson nor G-Unit accepted his apology and The Game has resumed his calls for a &quot;G-Unot&quot; boycott at concerts. Jackson released &quot;So Disrespectful&quot; on &quot;Before I Self Destruct&quot;, targeting Jay-Z, The Game and Young Buck. The Game responded with &quot;Shake&quot;, poking fun at the music video for Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Candy Shop&quot;.

On January 2, 2015, The Game claimed that he and 50 were &quot;sworn enemies&quot;, promising never to reconcile with him anymore, but on August 1, 2016, they ended their twelve-year feud when the two were in the Ace of Diamonds strip club and The Game said &quot;I love 50, man. What happened, that shit was 12 years ago.&quot;

In January 2022, the feud reiterated after 50 critiqued Game&#x27;s &quot;Drink Champs&quot; interview with N.O.R.E., where he claimed that 50&#x27;s former competitor Kanye West did &quot;more for me in two weeks than [Dr.] Dre did for me throughout my entire career&quot;. The Game responded, commenting that he enclosed the entirety of G-Unit as a group and clothing brand &quot;in a casket&quot;, also expressing his likeliness in the &quot;Power&quot; television trilogy, but warning 50 to &quot;leave [the past] alone or else... I&#x27;m outside #Numinati&quot;. Then, two months later, in March, 50 Cent published a video via Instagram of Game being shunned by former Interscope Records CEO Jimmy Iovine at a basketball game, poking fun of it while also commenting &quot;50 wrote ya hits&quot;. The Game once again flamed 50 after the claims were brought back up and also bragged to &quot;get [50&#x27;s] girlfriend out of my DM&#x27;s&quot;. This was believed to have been a consequential result of Game claiming on &quot;Drink Champs&quot; to be &quot;the best and a better rapper&quot; than Eminem, with whom 50 still remains close friends. Additionally, Game&#x27;s manager, Wack 100, has subliminally called out or questioned 50 Cent&#x27;s credibility, over the rapper&#x27;s surprise appearance at the Super Bowl LVI halftime show and ghostwriting allegations.

=== Cam&#x27;ron ===
Jackson&#x27;s issues with former The Diplomats member Cam&#x27;ron began in 2007, when they had a live argument on &quot;The Angie Martinez Show&quot; on Hot 97 radio. Jackson commented that he felt that the music division of Koch Entertainment (known today as MNRK Music Group) was a &quot;graveyard&quot;, meaning major record labels would not work with their artists. Cam&#x27;ron then ridiculed the record sales of G-Unit members Lloyd Banks and Mobb Deep by pointing out that Dipset member Jim Jones outsold both of their albums despite not being signed to a major label, and also went on to clarify that his group, The Diplomats, had a distribution deal from several labels. Both rappers released diss songs with videos on YouTube. Jackson released &quot;Funeral Music&quot;, and suggested in the song that Cam&#x27;ron is no longer able to lead The Diplomats and that Jim Jones should take his place. Cam&#x27;ron responded with &quot;Curtis&quot; and &quot;Curtis Pt. II&quot;, in which he makes fun of not only Jackson&#x27;s first name, but also his appearance, calling him &quot;a gorilla, with rabbit teeth&quot;. Jackson responded by releasing &quot;Hold On&quot; with Young Buck. Since 2009, the feud slowly died down, and they eventually reconciled in 2016.

===Rick Ross===
Although Rick Ross began a feud with Jackson over an alleged incident at the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards, Jackson told news sources he did not remember seeing Ross there. Later that month Ross&#x27; &quot;Mafia Music&quot; was leaked on the Internet, with lyrics apparently disparaging Jackson. Several days later, Jackson released &quot;Officer Ricky (Go Head, Try Me)&quot; in response to &quot;Mafia Music&quot;. The following day, Ross appeared on Shade 45 (Eminem&#x27;s Sirius channel) and told Jackson to come up with something better in 24 hours.

Before leaving for Venezuela, Jackson uploaded a video (&quot;Warning Shot&quot;) and the first of a series of &quot;Officer Ricky&quot; cartoons. In early February he uploaded a YouTube video in which he interviewed &quot;Tia&quot;, the mother of one of Ross&#x27; children; according to her, Ross is in reality a correctional officer. On February 5, 2009, The Game phoned Seattle radio station KUBE. Asked about the dispute between Jackson and Ross, he sided with Jackson and offered to mediate: &quot;Rick Ross, holla at your boy, man&quot; and &quot;50 eating you, boy.&quot;

On his album &quot;Deeper Than Rap&quot;, Ross refers to Jackson in &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and Jackson&#x27;s mock funeral is part of the song&#x27;s video. When the song was released, Ross said that he ended Jackson&#x27;s career. &quot;Rick Ross is Albert From CB4. You ever seen the movie? He&#x27;s Albert,&quot; Jackson replied in an interview. &quot;It never gets worse than this. You get a guy that was a correctional officer come out and base his entire career on writing material from a drug dealer&#x27;s perspective such as &quot;Freeway&quot; Ricky Ross.&quot; Their feud rekindled at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards, where Jackson and G-Unit members Kidd Kidd, Mike Knox, Tony Yayo were seen on video attacking Gunplay (a member of Ross&#x27; Maybach Music Group). Gunplay&#x27;s Maybach Music diamond necklace was stolen during the brawl, and several days later Jackson appeared at a Washington, D.C. bowling alley wearing Gunplay&#x27;s chain. On January 30, 2013, Jackson tweeted that Ross&#x27; attempted drive-by shooting on his birthday three days earlier was &quot;staged&quot;.

<text>Cornelius Jansen (; ; Latinized name Cornelius Jansenius; also Corneille Jansen; 28 October 1585 – 6 May 1638) was the Dutch Catholic bishop of Ypres in Flanders and the father of a theological movement known as Jansenism.

==Biography==

He was born to humble Catholic parents Jan Ottje, a smith, and Lijntje Gijsberts at Acquoy (then in the province of Holland, now in Gelderland). In 1602 he entered the University of Leuven, then in the throes of an ideological conflict between the Jesuit – or scholastic – party and the followers of Michael Baius, who swore by St. Augustine. Jansen ended by attaching himself strongly to the latter &quot;Augustinian&quot; party, and presently made a momentous friendship with a like-minded fellow-student, Jean du Vergier de Hauranne, afterwards &quot;Abbé de Saint-Cyran&quot;.

After taking his degree he went to Paris, partly to improve his health by a change of scene, partly to study Greek. Eventually he joined du Vergier at his country home near Bayonne, and spent some years teaching at the bishop&#x27;s college. All his spare time was spent in studying the early Fathers with du Vergier, and laying plans for a reform of the Church.

In 1616 he returned to Leuven, to take charge of the college of St Pulcheria, a hostel for Dutch students of theology. Pupils found him a somewhat choleric and exacting master and a great recluse from academic society. However, he took an active part in the university&#x27;s resistance to the Jesuits, for they had established a theological school of their own in Leuven, which was proving itself a formidable rival to the official university faculty of divinity. In the hope of suppressing their encroachments, Jansen was sent twice to Madrid, in 1624 and 1626; the second time he narrowly escaped the Inquisition. He warmly supported the Catholic missionary archbishop (apostolic vicar) of the Catholic Holland Mission in the Dutch Republic, Philippus Rovenius, in his contests with the Jesuits, who were trying to evangelize that country without regard to the archbishop&#x27;s wishes. He also crossed more than once the Dutch Calvinist–Presbyterian champion, Gisbertus Voetius, still remembered for his attacks on René Descartes.

Antipathy to the Jesuits brought Jansen no nearer to Protestantism; on the contrary, he yearned to beat them with their own weapons, chiefly by showing them that Roman Catholics could interpret the Bible in just as mystical and pietistic a manner. This became the great object of his lectures, when he was appointed regius professor of scriptural interpretation at Leuven in 1630. Still more was it the object of his &quot;Augustinus&quot;, a bulky treatise on the theology of St. Augustine, barely finished at the time of his death.

Its preparation was his chief occupation since his return to Leuven. He had introduced in this treaty a long development favourable to contrition (IIIrd part, &quot;De gratia Christi salvatoris&quot;, book V, chap.XXI–XXV). In its appendix, titled &quot;Erroris Massiliensium, et opinionis quorumdam recentiorum parallelon et statera&quot;, he harshly condemned the Jesuits, in particular Luis de Molina, Gabriel Vasquez and Leonardus Lessius.

But Jansen, as he said, did not mean to be a school-pedant all his life; and there were moments when he entertained political ambitions. He looked forward to a time when Flanders would throw off the Spanish yoke and become an independent Catholic republic, possibly even Flemish-ruled, according to the model of the Protestant United Provinces. These ideas became known to his Spanish rulers, and to assuage them he wrote a philippic called the &quot;Mars gallicus&quot; (1635), a violent attack on French ambitions generally, and on Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s indifference to international Catholic interests in particular.

The &quot;Mars gallicus&quot; did little to help Jansen&#x27;s rather persecuted theological friends in France, but it reversed Madrid&#x27;s wrath with Jansen; in 1636 he was appointed bishop of Ypres (Ieper) in West Flanders by the Pope and the Spanish Court. Within two years he was however cut down at age 52 by a sudden illness; the &quot;Augustinus&quot;, the book of his life, was published posthumously in 1640.

Opposed to Jansenism, a little group of theological doctors from the Sorbonne extracted 8 propositions of Jansenius&#x27;s &quot;Augustinus&quot;, later reduced to 5, treating of the problems concerning the relation between nature and grace. They accused Jansenius of having misinterpreted St. Augustine, conflating Jansenists with Lutherans. This led Pope Innocent X to condemn in 1653 these 5 propositions in the papal bull &quot;Cum Occasione&quot;, without attributing them to Jansenius in particular. The 5 propositions were condemned again by Pope Alexander VII three years later in the apostolic constitution &quot;Ad sanctam beati Petri sedem&quot;. The Jesuits, who then enjoyed predominant political and theological power (including a personal confessor to the King of France), then persuaded the Pope to force all Jansenists to sign a formulary leading them to admit the papal bull and to confess to their errors. The formulary controversy led Pascal to write the famous &quot;Lettres provinciales&quot; (1657) in which he harshly attacked the Jesuits and their moral, in particular their casuistry.

Following this anonymous publication, the King sent spies everywhere, condemned the librarians and successfully attempted to discover the author of the &quot;Lettres provinciales&quot;. The Jansenists of Port-Royal, Antoine Arnauld, Pierre Nicole, La Mère Angélique, Soeur Agnès, etc., were forced to sign the formulary. Although ostensibly obeying Papal authority, they added that the condemnation would only be sensible if the 5 allegedly heretical propositions were in fact found in Jansenius&#x27; &quot;Augustinus&quot;, and claimed that they did not figure there. The Jansenists&#x27; reasoning was that the Pope had of course the power to condemn heretical propositions, but not to cause that which did not figure in Jansenius&#x27; &quot;Augustinus&quot; to actually be there. This strategy would impose decades of theological disputes and debate.

On the other hand, Pascal and some other Jansenists adopted a radical strategy, alleging that condemning Jansenius was equivalent to condemning the Father of the Church, St. Augustine himself, and adamantly refused to sign the formulary, with or without reserve. This in turn led to the further radicalization of the King and of the Jesuits, and in 1661 the Convent of Port-Royal was closed and the Jansenist community dissolved – it would be ultimately razed in 1710 on orders of Louis XIV. The controversy did not involve only Papal authority, but rather his authority concerning Biblical exegesis.

Further controversy led to the bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, issued by Clement XI in 1713, which marked the end of Catholic toleration of Jansenist doctrine. The bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, dated 8 September 1713, was produced with the contribution of , a lector at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;, fostered the condemnation of Jansenism by condemning 101 propositions from the &quot;Réflexions morales&quot; of Quesnel as heretical, and as identical with propositions already condemned in the writings of Jansen.

Up until the French Revolution, Jansenism would live on as a political force in France, supported by some chairs in the parlements of Paris. Anonymous Jansenists published a magazine called Nouvelles ecclésiastiques, which frequently featured anti-Jesuit propaganda. Eventually, Jansenists would collaborate with independent-minded Gallicanists in promoting the Jesuits&#x27; expulsion from France in 1764.

<text>Victoria Falls (Lozi: &quot;Mosi-oa-Tunya&quot;, &quot;Thundering Smoke&quot;; Tonga: &quot;Shungu Namutitima&quot;, &quot;Boiling Water&quot;) is a waterfall on the Zambezi River, located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest waterfalls, with a width of . The region around it has a high degree of biodiversity in both plants and animals.

Archaeology and oral history describe a long record of African knowledge of the site. Although known to some European geographers before the 19th century, Scottish missionary David Livingstone identified the falls in 1855, naming them Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria. Since the mid-20th century, the site has been a major tourist destination. Zambia and Zimbabwe both have national parks and tourism infrastructure at the site. Research in the late 2010s found that precipitation variability due to climate change is likely to alter the character of the falls.

== Name origins ==
David Livingstone was the first European recorded to have viewed the falls on 16 November 1855, from an island now known as Livingstone Island, one of two land masses in the middle of the river, immediately upstream from the falls near the Zambian shore. Livingstone named his sighting in honour of Queen Victoria, but the Sotho language name, &quot;Mosi-oa-Tunya&quot;—&quot;The Smoke That Thunders&quot;—continues in common usage. The World Heritage List officially recognises both names. Livingstone also cited an older name, &quot;Seongo&quot; or &quot;Chongwe&quot;, which means &quot;The Place of the Rainbow&quot;, as a result of the constant spray.

The nearby national park in Zambia is named &quot;Mosi-oa-Tunya&quot;, whereas the national park and town on the Zimbabwean shore are both named Victoria Falls.

== Size ==
Victoria Falls is classified as the largest based on its combined width of and height of , resulting in the world&#x27;s largest sheet of falling water.

For a considerable distance upstream from the falls, the Zambezi flows over a level sheet of basalt in a shallow valley, bounded by low and distant sandstone hills. The river&#x27;s course is dotted with numerous tree-covered islands, which increase in number when the river approaches the falls. There is a flat plateau extending in all directions.

The falls are formed where the full width of the river plummets in a single vertical drop into a transverse chasm wide, carved along a fracture zone in the basalt plateau. The depth of the chasm, called the First Gorge, varies from at its western end to in the centre. The only outlet from the First Gorge is a gap about two-thirds of the way across the width of the falls from the western end. The whole volume of the river pours into the Victoria Falls gorges from this narrow cleft.

Two islands on the crest of the falls: Boaruka Island (or Cataract Island) near the western bank, and Livingstone Island near the middle. At less than full flood, additional islets divide the curtain of water into separate parallel streams. The main streams are named, in order from Zimbabwe (west) to Zambia (east): the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Cataract&quot; (called &quot;Leaping Water&quot; by some), the &quot;Main Falls&quot;, the &quot;Rainbow Falls&quot; (the highest) and the &quot;Eastern Cataract&quot;.
The River Zambezi, upstream from the falls, experiences a rainy season from late November to early April, and a dry season the rest of the year. The river&#x27;s annual flood season is February to May with a peak in April. The spray from the falls typically rises to a height of over , sometimes up to twice as high, and is visible from up to away. At full moon, a &quot;moonbow&quot; can also be seen. During the flood season, however, the foot and the face of the waterfall can&#x27;t be seen.

When the dry season takes effect, the islets on the crest become wider and more numerous. From September to January, up to half of the rocky face of the falls may become dry, allowing the bottom of the First Gorge to be seen along most of its length. At this time, it becomes possible (though not necessarily safe) to walk across some stretches of the river at the crest. It is also possible to walk to the bottom of the First Gorge at the Zimbabwean side. The minimum flow, which occurs in November, is around a tenth of the April figure; this variation in flow is greater than that of other major falls and causes the Victoria Falls&#x27; annual average flow rate to be lower than might be expected based on the maximum flow. In 2019 unusually low rain dramatically reduced the fall to the lowest flow in a century. Global climate change and changed climate patterns are suggested to have caused this.

== Gorges ==

The entire volume of the Zambezi River pours through the First Gorge&#x27;s wide exit for a distance of about , then enters a zigzagging series of gorges designated by the order in which the river reaches them. Water entering the &quot;Second Gorge&quot; makes a sharp right turn and has carved out a deep pool there called the &quot;Boiling Pot&quot;. Reached via a steep footpath from the Zambian side, it is about across. Its surface is smooth at low water, but at high water is marked by enormous, slow swirls and heavy turbulence.

The principal gorges are
* First Gorge: the one the river falls into at Victoria Falls
* Second Gorge: south of falls, long, spanned by the Victoria Falls Bridge
* Third Gorge: south, long, containing the Victoria Falls Power Station
* Fourth Gorge: south, long
* Fifth Gorge: south, long
* Songwe Gorge: south, long named after the small Songwe River coming from the north-east, and the deepest at , the level of the river in them varies by up to between wet and dry seasons.

== Formation ==
The Upper Zambezi River originally drained south through present day Botswana to join the Limpopo River. A general uplift of the land between Zimbabwe and the Kalahari Desert about 2 million years ago blocked this drainage route, and a large paleolake known as Lake Makgadikgadi formed between the Kalahari and the Batoka Basaltic Plateau of Zimbabwe and Zambia. This lake was originally endorheic and had no natural outlet. Under wetter climate conditions about 20,000 years BP, it eventually overflowed and began to drain to the east, cutting the Batoka Gorge through the basalt.

The recent geological history of Victoria Falls can be seen in the overall form of the Batoka Gorge, with its six individual gorges and eight past positions of the falls. The east–west oriented gorges imply structural control with alignment along joints of shatter zones, or faults with of vertical displacement as is the case of the second and fifth gorges. Headward erosion along these structural lines of weakness would establish a new fall line and abandonment of the earlier line. North-south oriented joints control the south flowing sections of the river. One of these is the &quot;Boiling Pot&quot;, which links the First Gorge with the Second Gorge.

The falls may have already started cutting back the next major gorge, at the dip in one side of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Cataract&quot;, between the western river bank and Cataract Island. The lip in the current falls is lowest here and carries the greatest concentration of water at flood stage.

The sedimentary sequence overlying the basalt at the Zambezi River margins is called the Victoria Falls Formation, which consists of gravel, the Pipe sandstone, Kalahari sand, aeolian sand and alluvium. A 15–45 m scarp bounds the river about 5–6 km from the main channel, and a series of river terraces are evident between the scarp and the channel.

== History ==

=== Geological history ===
The basalt plateau of Victoria Falls, over which the Zambezi River flows, was formed during the Jurassic period, around 200 million years ago.

=== Pre-colonial history ===
Early Stone Age Acheulean stone artefacts and Oldowan tools were excavated at archaeological sites around the falls, as well as Sangoan tools and Lupemban artefacts dating to the Middle Stone Age.
Early Iron Age pottery was excavated at a vlei site near Masuma Dam in the early 1960s. Evidence for iron smelting was also found in a settlement dating to the late first millennium AD.

The southern Tonga people known as the Batoka/Tokalea called the falls &quot;Shungu na mutitima&quot;. The Matabele, later arrivals, named them &quot;aManz&#x27; aThunqayo&quot;, and the Batswana and Makololo (whose language is used by the Lozi people) call them &quot;Mosi-o-Tunya&quot;. All these names mean essentially &quot;the smoke that thunders&quot;.

A map drawn by Nicolas de Fer in 1715 shows the fall clearly marked in the correct position. It also shows dotted lines denoting trade routes that David Livingstone followed 140 years later. A map from c. 1750 drawn by Jacques Nicolas Bellin for Abbé Antoine François Prevost d&#x27;Exiles marks the falls as &quot;cataractes&quot; and notes a settlement to the north of the Zambezi as being friendly with the Portuguese at the time.

=== 19th century ===
In November 1855, David Livingstone was the first European who saw the falls, when he traveled from the upper Zambezi to the mouth of the river between 1852 and 1856. The falls were well known to local tribes, and Voortrekker hunters may have known of them, as may the Arabs under a name equivalent to &quot;the end of the world&quot;. Europeans were sceptical of their reports, perhaps thinking that the lack of mountains and valleys on the plateau made a large fall unlikely.

Livingstone had been told about the falls before he reached them from upriver and was paddled across to the Livingstone Island in Zambia.

In 1860, Livingstone returned to the area and made a detailed study of the falls with John Kirk. Other early European visitors included Portuguese explorer Serpa Pinto, Czech explorer Emil Holub, who made the first detailed plan of the falls and its surroundings in 1875 (published in 1880), and British artist Thomas Baines, who executed some of the earliest paintings of the falls. Until the area was opened up by the building of the railway in 1905, though, the falls were seldom visited by other Europeans. Some writers believe that the Portuguese priest Gonçalo da Silveira was the first European to catch sight of the falls back in the sixteenth century.

=== History since 1900 ===
==== Victoria Falls Bridge initiates tourism ====
European settlement of the Victoria Falls area started around 1900 in response to the desire of Cecil Rhodes&#x27; British South Africa Company for mineral rights and imperial rule north of the Zambezi, and the exploitation of other natural resources such as timber forests north-east of the falls, and ivory and animal skins. Before 1905, the river was crossed above the falls at the Old Drift, by dugout canoe or a barge towed across with a steel cable. Rhodes&#x27; vision of a Cape-Cairo railway drove plans for the first bridge across the Zambezi. He insisted it be built where the spray from the falls would fall on passing trains, so the site at the Second Gorge was chosen. (See the main article Victoria Falls Bridge for details.) From 1905 the railway offered accessible travel from as far as the Cape in the south and from 1909, as far as the Belgian Congo in the north. In 1904 the Victoria Falls Hotel was opened to accommodate visitors arriving on the new railway. The falls became an increasingly popular attraction during British colonial rule of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), with the town of Victoria Falls becoming the main tourist centre.

==== During independence movements ====
In 1964, Northern Rhodesia became the independent state of Zambia. The following year, Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence. This was not recognised by Zambia, the United Kingdom nor the vast majority of states and led to United Nations-mandated sanctions. In response to the emerging crisis, in 1966 Zambia restricted or stopped border crossings. It did not re-open the border completely until 1980. The Rhodesian Bush War erupted on the southern side of the Zambezi from 1972 to 1980 with terrorist incursions from Zambia, Mozambique and Botswana. Visitor numbers began to drop, particularly on the Rhodesian side. Periodic Rhodesian military cross-border operations against guerrilla camps in Zambia, caused the Zambians to impose security measures including the stationing of soldiers to restrict access to the gorges and some parts of the falls.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s internationally recognized independence in 1980 brought comparative peace, and the 1980s witnessed renewed levels of tourism and the development of the region as a centre for adventure sports. Activities that gained popularity in the area include whitewater rafting in the gorges, bungee jumping from the bridge, game fishing, horse riding, kayaking, e-biking, and sightseeing flights over the falls.

==== Tourism in recent years ====
By the end of the 1990s, almost 400,000 people were visiting the falls annually, and this was expected to rise to over a million in the next decade. Unlike the game parks, Victoria Falls has more Zimbabwean and Zambian visitors than international tourists; the attraction is accessible by bus and train, and is therefore comparatively inexpensive to reach.

The numbers of visitors to the Zimbabwean side of the falls has historically been much higher than the number visiting the Zambian side, due to the greater development of the visitor facilities there. However, the number of tourists visiting Zimbabwe began to decline in the early 2000s as political tensions between supporters and opponents of president Robert Mugabe increased. In 2006, hotel occupancy on the Zimbabwean side hovered at around 30%, while the Zambian side was near capacity, with rates in top hotels reaching US$630 per night. The rapid development has prompted the United Nations to consider revoking the falls&#x27; status as a World Heritage Site. In addition, problems of waste disposal and a lack of effective management of the falls&#x27; environment are a concern.
A famous feature is the naturally formed &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pool&quot;, an infinity pool that sits on the lip of Victoria Falls, on the Zambian side, along the western tip of Livingstone Island. When the river flow is at a certain level, usually between September and December, a rock barrier forms an eddy with minimal current, allowing adventurous swimmers to splash around in relative safety in front of the point where the water cascades over the falls.

== Natural environment ==
=== National parks ===
The two national parks at the falls are relatively small– Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park is and Victoria Falls National Park is . However, next to the latter on the southern bank is the Zambezi National Park, extending west along the river. Animals can move between the two Zimbabwean parks and can also reach Matetsi Safari Area, Kazuma Pan National Park and Hwange National Park to the south.

On the Zambian side, fences and the outskirts of Livingstone tend to confine most animals to the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park. In addition fences put up by lodges in response to crime restrict animal movement.

On Botswana’s side of the border, Chobe National Park is a short distance to travel to and is a popular location for a day trip for many tourists visiting Victoria Falls for extended stays. It offers more diverse flora and fauna than Hwange National Park.

In 2004 a separate group of police called the Tourism Police was started. They are commonly seen around the main tourist areas, and can be identified by their uniforms with yellow reflective bibs.

=== Vegetation ===
Riverine forest with palm trees lines the banks and islands above the falls. The most notable aspect of the area&#x27;s vegetation though is the rainforest nurtured by the spray from the falls, containing plants rare for the area such as pod mahogany, ebony, ivory palm, wild date palm, batoko plum and creepers and lianas. Outside the riparian zone, mopane woodland savannah predominates in the area, with smaller areas of miombo and Rhodesian teak woodland and shrubland savannah. Vegetation has suffered in recent droughts, and so have the animals that depend on it, particularly antelope.

=== Wildlife ===
The national parks contain abundant wildlife including sizeable populations of elephant, Cape buffalo, giraffe, Grant&#x27;s zebra, and a variety of antelope. Lions, African leopards and South African cheetahs are only occasionally seen. Vervet monkeys and baboons are common. The river above the falls contains large populations of hippopotamus and crocodile. African bush elephants cross the river in the dry season at particular crossing points.

Klipspringers, honey badgers, lizards and clawless otters can be glimpsed in the gorges, but they are mainly known for 35 species of raptors. The Taita falcon, Verreaux&#x27;s eagle, peregrine falcon and augur buzzard breed there. Above the falls, herons, African fish eagles and numerous kinds of waterfowl are common.

=== Fish ===
The river is home to 39 species of fish below the falls and 84 species above it. This illustrates the effectiveness of the falls as a dividing barrier between the upper and lower Zambezi.

=== Effects of climate change ===
In February 2020, National Geographic highlighted the threat to the falls from extreme weather conditions. Rising temperatures make the region hotter and drier. There is substantial water flow variability from year to year, with a significant drop in the general trend of water flow in September, October, November and December. This is particularly pronounced in drought years, which are becoming more frequent and intense. Such occurrences have affected the aesthetics of the waterfalls, and there are fears that Victoria Falls might join other World Heritage sites categorised as last-chance destinations.

Recognition of the risks to the falls has sparked great debate among those in the tourism industry in both Zambia and Zimbabwe. Many experts in the region dismiss the story as ill-researched and irresponsible journalism. They do not deny climate change and the impact it is having on the amount of water that cascades over the falls, but they argue the narrative is incomplete.

<text>Jacques (Jacob) Jordaens (19 May 1593 – 18 October 1678) was a Flemish painter, draughtsman and a designer of tapestries and prints. He was a prolific artist who created biblical, mythological, and allegorical compositions, genre scenes, landscapes, illustrations of Flemish sayings and portraits. After the death of Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, he became the leading Flemish Baroque painter of his time. Unlike those illustrious contemporaries he never travelled abroad to study the Antique and Italian painting and, except for a few short trips to locations elsewhere in the Low Countries, he resided in Antwerp his entire life. He also remained largely indifferent to Rubens and van Dyck&#x27;s intellectual and courtly aspirations. This attitude was expressed in his art through a lack of idealistic treatment which contrasted with that of these contemporaries.

His principal patrons were the wealthy bourgeoisie and local churches. Only late in his career did he receive royal commissions, including from King Charles I of England, Queen Christina of Sweden and the stadtholder class of the Dutch Republic. As well as being a successful painter, he was a prominent designer of tapestries and prints.

While he is today mostly identified with his large-scale genre scenes such as &quot;The King Drinks&quot; (also called the &quot;Feast of the Bean King&quot;) and &quot;As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young&quot;, his contemporary reputation was based as much on his numerous mythological, allegorical and biblical scenes. Often regarded as a pupil and epigone of Rubens, he was never recorded as a member of Rubens&#x27; workshop. He regularly worked as an independent collaborator of Rubens. The principal influence of Rubens on his work is the use of the chiaroscuro technique which Rubens himself had mastered through his study of Caravaggio&#x27;s paintings during his stay in Italy. His main artistic influences, besides Rubens, were northern Italian painters such as Jacopo Bassano, Paolo Veronese, and Caravaggio.

==Life==
===Early years===
Jacques Jordaens was born in Antwerp on 19 May 1593, the first of eleven children of the wealthy linen merchant Jacob Jordaens and Barbara van Wolschaten. Little is known about Jordaens&#x27; early education. It is likely that he received the advantages of the education usually provided for children of his social class as is demonstrated by his clear handwriting, competence in French and thorough knowledge of mythology. His familiarity with biblical subjects is further evidenced in his many religious paintings. His personal interest in the Bible was illustrated by his later conversion from Catholicism to Protestantism.
Like Rubens, he studied under Adam van Noort, who was his only teacher. He was registered in the local Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of van Noort in the year 1607. During this time Jordaens lived in van Noort&#x27;s house in the Everdijstraat where he became very close to the family. In 1615, after eight years of training with van Noort, he was accepted in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a master &quot;waterscilder&quot; (&#x27;water painter&#x27;). It has been inferred from this that Jordaens initially painted tempera canvases, which in the 17th century served as substitutes for tapestries or were used as tapestry cartoons. No examples of his earliest tempera works are extant. It is not clear whether Jordaens actually painted such works as his master van Noort was not known to create such works.
Jordaens never made the traditional trip to Italy to study classical and Italian art. On 15 May 1616, he married his master&#x27;s eldest daughter, Catharina van Noort. The couple had three children, Elizabeth, Jacob, who became a painter, and Anna Catharina. The couple originally lived with or near Jordaens&#x27; father in law. In 1618, they bought two adjoining houses in the Hoogstraat, the street where Jordaens was born, but which were situated behind the house of the merchant Backx. His father in law later moved in with them. Jordaens became in 1616 a member of the &#x27;Gilde van de Armenbus&#x27; (Guild of the Poor Box). This guild was a sort of insurance pool for artists with health problems. On 28 September 1621 he took on the position of dean of the Guild of Saint Luke. He accepted the position on condition that he would solely cover the expenses incurred during his tenure and not be responsible for the debts left by his predecessors. He held the position for only one year.

===Career===
Even before he was admitted as a master in the Guild he had started working for the free market. In the early period of his career he had contact with the workshop of Rubens in Antwerp and produced many mythological and allegorical compositions as well as biblical scenes. In 1628, he was, together with Rubens and van Dyck, commissioned by the Augustine order to each paint an altar in the Augustine church in Antwerp. Rubens painted a &quot;Virgin and Child Adored by Saints&quot; for the high altar while van Dyck contributed a &quot;St. Augustine in Ecstasy&quot; for the altar on the left. Jordaens painted the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Apollonia&quot; for the altar on the right (still &quot;in situ&quot;). Jordaens&#x27; rendition of the martyrdom of St. Apollonia, who jumped into a fire rather than denounce her faith in the 3rd century, is crowded and dramatic. It was likely Rubens who had been able to secure this commission. That Jordaens was also invited to contribute to this project shows the high regard in which he was already held at that early period of his career.
Jordaens was one of the artists invited to work on the decorations for the Joyous Entry into Antwerp of the new governor of the Habsburg Netherlands Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand in 1635. Rubens was in overall charge of this project. For this event, Jordaens made decorative paintings after designs by Rubens. In collaboration with Cornelis de Vos he completed the triumphal arch of Philip that was erected in the Huidenvetterstraat. It was one of the principal decorative elements in Rubens&#x27;s designs. It has not been preserved as it was solely intended as a temporary decoration for the Joyous Entry.

Rubens received in 1636 a commission from the Spanish king Philip IV of Spain to create various mythological paintings to decorate the Torre de la Parada, a hunting lodge of the king near Madrid. The mythological scenes depicted in the series were largely based on the Metamorphoses of Ovid. Rubens realized this important commission with the assistance of a large number of Antwerp painters such as David Teniers the Younger, Cornelis de Vos, Jan Cossiers, Peter Snayers, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert, Theodoor van Thulden, Jan Boeckhorst, Peeter Symons, Jacob Peter Gowy and others, who worked after Rubens&#x27; modellos. Jordaens also played his part in this collaborative effort. Two works in the series attributed to Jordaens are &quot;Apollo and Pan&quot; (1637), made after a sketch by Rubens, and &quot;Vertummus and Pomona&quot; (1638). Further contributions which he may have made are the &quot;Fall of the Titans&quot;, the &quot;Marriage of Peleus and Thetis&quot;, and &quot;Cadmus Sowing the Dragons Teeth&quot;.
===Royal patronage===
Sometime during the years 1639–40, Jordaens was commissioned through Balthazar Gerbier, the English King Charles&#x27; agent in Brussels, and Cesare Alessandro Scaglia, a diplomat residing in Antwerp, to create a set of 22 paintings illustrating &quot;The Story of Cupid and Psyche&quot;. Van Dyck&#x27;s &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; may also be related to this commission. While the works were to be displayed in the Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich upon completion, the patron and final location were unknown to Jordaens at the time he received the commission. When Jordaens submitted his initial designs to his intermediaries between himself and the English court, Gerbier was still attempting to convince the King that Rubens was a better choice for a project requiring a thorough skill in foreshortening. His efforts failed when Rubens died on 30 May 1640. With Rubens&#x27; death, Jordaens was given the sole responsibility for the entire commission. Efforts to complete the project continued slowly until in May 1641 all plans for &quot;The Story of Cupid and Psyche&quot; series were disrupted with the death of the diplomat Scaglia. The project was never completed and only eight paintings were delivered to the English Court. A dispute with Scaglia&#x27;s heirs over payment for seven of these works continued into the next generation.

He also received a commission from Ruben&#x27;s heirs to finish a painting of &quot;Hercules and Andromeda&quot; commissioned by Philip IV of Spain. On 21 April 1648 he received a commission to produce 35 large ceiling paintings for Queen Christina of Sweden&#x27;s castle in Uppsala, Sweden. It is not clear whether Jordaens ever completed this commission or if the works ever reached their destination.

In 1651 he received one of his final large commissions. Amalia van Solms, widow of the Dutch Stadtholder Prince Frederick Henry of Orange invited various artists to decorate the manorial house Huis ten Bosch in The Hague which was built in 1645. For the Orange hall in the manor, Jordaens painted the &quot;Triumph of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange&quot;, a large allegorical painting of Prince Frederick Henry&#x27;s military successes.
In 1661, he was commissioned to paint large lunettes for the newly constructed Amsterdam Town Hall. Two of the lunettes deal with biblical subjects, (the &quot;David and Goliath&quot; and &quot;Samson defeats the Philistines&quot;) and two depict scenes from Dutch history (&quot;A Roman Camp under Attack by Night&quot; and &quot;Peace between the Romans and the Batavians&quot;).

===A palatial residence in Antwerp===
In 1633, his parents&#x27; estate was divided among himself, his brother Izaak and his sisters Anna, Magdalena and Elisabeth. From the estate he received his birth house &quot;Het Paradijs&quot;. In 1634 he bought two more houses on the Verversrui. In 1639 Jordaens bought the large house &quot;De Halle van Lier&quot; or &quot;Turnhoutsche Halle&quot;, at number 43 on the Hoogstraat, which was located in front of the houses in which he was then living. He had the three houses converted into a new large complex. He lived and worked there until his death in 1678. He designed the facades of the large inner court yard in the style of Rubens&#x27; house constructed two decades earlier. He decorated the house with sculptures, carpets and decorative furniture. For the two back rooms on the south he created ceiling paintings, including the series of The Signs of the Zodiac, twelve allegorical paintings of the signs of the Zodiac, painted around 1640. The series is now installed in the ceiling of the East Gallery of the Palais du Luxembourg in Paris.

In 1652 he painted for his &#x27;showroom&#x27; (pronkkamer) in the south wing of his home nine ceiling pieces depicting the erotic history of the god of love Cupid and the royal daughter Psyche. According to the inventory left by Jordaens&#x27; grandchildren, these paintings were part of the sale of the house in 1708. The walls and doors of the room were also covered with paintings. This was the room where Jordaens received his guests and clients. The decoration of the room was intended to impress his visitors by his mastery through the depiction of the mythological tale of earthly and heavenly love, betrayal and fidelity. As the paintings from the &quot;Story of Cupid and Psyche&quot; were mounted on the ceiling, Jordaens used a lot of foreshortening in the pictures to create the illusion of depth. The perspective system was borrowed verbatim from Rubens&#x27; ceiling pieces in the Jesuit church in Antwerp. The paintings are viewed through an octagonal &#x27;aperture&#x27; frame. The canvas entitled &quot;Psyche receives the cup of immortality on the Olympus&quot; is the centrepiece of the series. Other paintings in the series are &quot;Psyche&#x27;s Father Questions the Oracle in the Temple of Apollo&quot;, the &quot;Love of Cupid and Psyche&quot;, the &quot;Oracle of Apollo&quot;, the &quot;Curiosity of Psyche&quot;, &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Flight&quot;, &quot;Psyche Received by the Gods&quot; and two putti pieces. The original ceiling and door paintings have survived and are now in the collection of The Phoebus Foundation in Antwerp. The paintings on the walls are lost but some of the designs for them have been preserved.
===Religion===
In Antwerp, which was ruled by Catholic Spanish monarchs, the Protestant religion was forbidden although it should have been tolerated under the terms of the 1648 Peace of Münster which officially recognised the Dutch Republic. Towards the end of his lifetime Jordaens converted to Calvinism. He, his wife and daughter Elizabeth were members of the Calvinist congregation that had been established in Antwerp after the Peace of Münster despite the continued repression of Protestantism in the Habsburg Netherlands. His daughter Anna Catharina was likely also a member as she married a Jansenist. His religious affiliation did not stop him from accepting commissions to decorate Catholic churches. The &quot;schout&quot; of Antwerp fined Jordaens between 1651 and 1658 an amount of 200 pounds and 15 shillings for his &#x27;scandalous&#x27; (i.e. heretical) writings.

===Death and burial===
In October 1678, Jordaens died of the mysterious sweating sickness (&#x27;zweetziekte&#x27; or &#x27;polderkoorts&#x27; in Dutch), which, on the same day, also killed his unmarried daughter Elizabeth, who was living with him. They were buried together under one tombstone in the Protestant cemetery in Putte, a village just north of the Belgian border, where his wife Catharina had been put to rest upon her death in 1659.
One year after his death, Jordaens&#x27; son-in-law donated twenty-five Flemish pounds to the Camer van den Huysarmen (&#x27;Chamber of the Almoners&#x27;) in Antwerp. He also donated Jordaens&#x27; painting &quot;The Washing and Anointing of the Body of Christ&quot; to the Maagdenhuis, an orphanage for girls in Antwerp. Apparently, these gifts were made in execution of instructions which Jacques Jordaens, who died intestate, had left behind. During his lifetime the kindness of Jordaens was recognized by those who knew him as is attested by various surviving documents.

The grandchildren of Jordaens moved to the Dutch Republic.

===Workshop practice===
Jordaens managed a large workshop as is attested by the large number of pupils that trained with him. A position in Jordaens&#x27; studio was highly desirable for young artists. The Guild records show he trained fifteen pupils between 1621 and 1667, the most famous of whom was Jan Boeckhorst. Six other persons are referred to as his pupils in court documents while they do not appear in the Guild records. It is therefore probable that he had more students than those recorded in the Guild records. Among his pupils were his son Jacob and his cousin Arnoldus Jordaens. Through his international reputation Jordaens attracted foreign artists to his studio as his pupils. After 1642 the Polish artist Aleksander Jan Tricius became his pupil and in 1645 Queen Christina of Sweden intended to send her protégé Georg Waldau (Joris Waldon) to his workshop, but this plan came to nothing due to the threat of war in Flanders.

Like Rubens and other artists at that time, Jordaens&#x27; workshop relied on assistants and pupils in the production of his paintings. Not many of these pupils went on to achieve fame themselves. His workshop practices occasionally caused him trouble. In 1648 one of his patrons, Martinus van Langenhoven, accused him of having sold him inauthentic paintings. Jordaens defended himself against the accusation with the argument that he had personally put the finishing touches on works executed by assistants in his workshop.

==Work==
===General===

Jordaens was a very prolific painter, draftsman and designer of tapestries and prints who left a large oeuvre. He worked primarily, though not exclusively, for the rich Antwerp bourgeoisie. He received also a few commissions from aristocratic patrons. The many commissions, also from church patrons, he received after becoming the leading Flemish painter following Rubens&#x27; death resulted in a decline in the quality of his output due to an increased reliance on workshop assistance. Jordaens&#x27; paintings are populated with many figures, even though he lacked compositional talent. He combined high art with folk culture related elements. The popular tone of his genre painting sometimes borders on the caricature as he depicts his personages acting in a very effusive manner. His art has often been regarded as less idealized than that of Rubens and van Dyck. Nevertheless, it is now known that even though he did not read Latin or Greek and was thus unable to access the classical sources in their original language, he did rely on his knowledge of French to read classical literature in French translations. It is, for instance, known that for his &quot;Marsyas ill-treated by the Muses&quot; (on display at the Mauritshuis, The Hague), Jordaens relied on a French translation of the &quot;Eikones&quot; (Images) by Greek author Philostratus. This author of the third century A.D. wrote descriptions of 65 paintings which he had seen in a picture gallery in Naples. Jordaens&#x27;s painting of Marsyas illustrates the painting entitled &quot;Pan&quot; in the &quot;Eikones&quot;.

An example of this combination of high art and populist tendencies is shown in his multiple versions of the fable of &quot;The Satyr and the Peasant&quot;. Based on the fable of the Satyr and the Peasant from Aesop&#x27;s &quot;Fables&quot;, Jordaens used the fable to combine two of the painting genres in which he excelled: mythological painting and the peasant genre. His various interpretations of the subject and the many repetitions of these works by his workshop and followers popularized the theme which was then taken up by Flemish and Dutch painters such as Jan Cossiers and Jan Steen.

===Influence of Rubens===

Jordaens was greatly influenced by Rubens who occasionally employed him to reproduce his designs in a larger format. After the death of Rubens, Jordaens advanced to the position of one of the most prominent painters in Antwerp. Like Rubens, Jordaens relied on a warm palette, naturalism, and a mastery of chiaroscuro and tenebrism. Jordaens excelled in representations of the base character of humanity. His classically inspired peasant themes and large-scale moralistic genre scenes influenced Jan Steen. Although Jacques Jordaens did not specialize, he often repeated a theme based on a proverb that depicted a wide range of characters of a variety of ages, crowded in a festive scene around a banquet table. These humorous pieces have a sense of coarseness. While Jordaens drew upon Rubens&#x27; motifs throughout his career, his work is distinguished by its greater realism, a crowding of the surface of his compositions and a preference for the burlesque, even within the context of religious and mythological subjects.

In the final years of his career between 1652 and 1678 his creative and artistic abilities declined. He abandoned vibrant colours in favour of a grey-blue palette, accented at times with a dull brown and applied paint so thinly that the canvas could be seen. However, there were some exceptions to this such as the religious paintings he produced after he had converted to Protestantism and the &quot;Story of Cupid and Psyche&quot; that he created for his own house.

===Subjects===
In addition to being a well-known portrait painter, Jordaens painted biblical, mythological and allegorical subjects and landscapes and even etched a number of plates. Although primarily a history painter, he also painted illustrations of Flemish proverbs, such as &quot;As the Old Sing, So the Young Pipe&quot;, and depictions of Flemish festivals, for example &quot;The King Drinks&quot;, also called &quot;The Feast of the Bean King&quot;. Several of his works hint at a passion for animal painting. He often included a variety of animals, most likely drawn from life, including cows, horses, poultry, cats, dogs, and sheep. His life drawings of both animals and people were used and referenced throughout his life.

Throughout his career Jordaens had a penchant for returning to the same subjects resulting in various works reprising the same subject, sometimes in almost identical copies and in other instances as reworkings of the subject matter. Examples are the multiple versions of the fable of &quot;The Satyr and the Peasant&quot; discussed above and the multiple versions of the story of &quot;Mercury and Argus&quot;, the earliest version of which was painted circa 1620 (Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon). As a devout Christian he also painted various versions of the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; of which he painted at least 7 versions. In the latter subject he usually grouped half-length figures closely together and cropped the scene so that the viewer would focus all attention on the figures. This compositional approach sought to intensify the narrative and accentuate the characters&#x27; expression.

===&quot;As the Old Sing, So the Young Pipe&quot;===

&quot;As the Old Sang, So the Young Pipe&quot; (c.1638–1640) is considered a companion to &quot;The King Drinks&quot; (also called &quot;The Feast of the Bean King&quot;) (Louvre, Paris). Both paintings are of a moralizing nature, have near identical measurements, and related styles. &quot;As the Old Sang, So the Young Pipe&quot; shows three generations of wealthy Antwerp burghers sitting around a table making music. Being a popular theme among Jordaens and his clients, several versions of this painting were created. In the version shown, Jordaens&#x27; father-in-law Adam van Noort is depicted as the old man. In this popular painting genre, elderly and middle-aged figures are always portrayed singing and creating music, as children &quot;pipe&quot; along.

The title is based on a popular proverb from the book &quot;Spiegel van den Ouden ende Nieuwen Tijdt&quot;, an Emblem book by Jacob Cats published in 1632. The Dutch proverb is &quot;Zo de ouden zongen, zo piepen de jongen&quot;, referring to the habit of birds to echo the &quot;pipe&quot;, or peeping chirp of their parents. Cats, a Calvinist, translated the proverb into a moralizing message; parents must be mindful of their actions and words, because children will copy their elders. The Dutch word for peep is just as in English, very close to the word pipe, and in this version, the bagpipe and flute pipe are used, but in some versions, the children are portrayed smoking a pipe, which even in those days was considered unhealthy for children.

Jan Steen also used a bagpipe and flute in his paintings on the same subject from around 1668 and 1670, even depicting the poem by Cats in the former of the two scenes. In his paintings however, Jordaens conveys this moralizing message as well as the idea that younger generations succeed their elders. The owl, considered the bird of the night, perched on the older woman&#x27;s wicker chair, serves as a &quot;memento mori&quot;, a reminder of mortality.

===&quot;Prometheus&quot;===
Jordaens&#x27; 1640 painting &quot;Prometheus&quot; (depiction of the mythological tale of the titan Prometheus who had his liver pecked out by an eagle each day only to regenerate and begin the cycle anew the next day. Prometheus was punished for his audacity by Zeus for having given fire to man, not just in its physical form, but also in the fire of reason, which can be related to man&#x27;s creativity in arts and sciences. Jordaens&#x27; depiction is very much likened to Rubens &quot;Prometheus&quot;. Jordaens&#x27; positioning of the eagle, the backwards, heroically nude bloodshot-eyed Prometheus as well as the depiction of the punishment and pain through spastic twisting and contorted movements, are also common themes in Rubens&#x27; version.

In contrast with Rubens&#x27; version, Jordaens&#x27; depiction of Hermes arguable holds out the hope of release from the punishment; as in certain versions of the mythological story, Hermes helps obtain Prometheus gain freedom. Still, in the Prometheus Bound attributed to Aeschylus, Hermes treats Prometheus badly, which would undermine this optimistic interpretation. The depiction of the sacks of bones (used in another part of the myth to deceive Zeus) and a clay statue (which represents his creation of man) are also not part of Rubens&#x27; composition. Another notable difference is the look of pure agony in Jordaens&#x27; Prometheus while Rubens relies on the contortions of the body to convey the same feeling. Jordaens&#x27; Prometheus is a facial study, a prevalent subject found in the paintings of Jordaens and other artists of the period.

==Tapestry designs==
Jacques Jordaens&#x27; most significant body of work were the numerous designs he did for tapestries. As the most lucrative of the arts, tapestries were considered precious throughout the Renaissance and Baroque periods. These large wall hangings had begun to appear on the walls of wealthy European nobility in the fourteenth century. Following the success of the Brussels tapestries woven after the Raphael Cartoons, 16th and 17th-century patrons employed artists as tapestry designs; Jacques Jordaens, Peter Paul Rubens and Pietro Cortona flattered patrons allegorically in a manner that would identify them with famous historical or mythological figures, as a form of aristocratic self-promotion.

Jordaens found that he was particularly successful in the tapestry ventures. He was especially motivated in this field and his perfected techniques and style earned him numerous commissions for series of tapestries. He was seen as one of the leading tapestry designers of the era.

Jordaens&#x27; process of tapestry creation included a preliminary drawing or sketch of the design. The design then is transferred to larger, more detailed oil sketch for the full-scale cartoon, which the weavers work from directly in weaving tapestry. Jordaens began planning a tapestry by executing a preparatory drawing coloured with water-soluble pigments. Although Jordaens did some sketches in oil, most were executed on paper or, later in his career, directly on canvas. Jordaens&#x27; tapestries were made for the aristocracy who placed such high value on them they would carry them with them while they travelled or went on military campaigns as a symbol of their status. Jordaens&#x27; scope of artistic representation was diverse, ranging from mythology, country life, to the history of Charlemagne. It has been noted that Jordaens&#x27; tapestry design incorporated densely organized crowds of figures, packed into a flat two-dimensional picture plane emphasizing surface patterns which resulted in a &quot;woven picture&quot;. Just as he liked to crowd his genre paintings he carried forward to his tapestries.
==Drawings==
Maintaining trends in Flemish painting, Jordaens was a proponent of extending Rubens&#x27; and Van Dyck&#x27;s &quot;painterly&quot; style of art to his exceptionally prolific body of preparatory drawings. Today, approximately 450 drawings are attributed to Jordaens. There is continuing scholarly debate on the accuracy of attributions of Flemish drawings to either Jordaens or Rubens, due to their similar style and oeuvre. Jordaens and his contemporaries were proponents of the Flemish trend towards making, expanding, and modifying preparatory drafts for larger paintings or to add to their visual vocabulary the classical artistic ideals. As a painter-draftsman, Jordaens often employed gouache and washes to his preparatory drawings.

Rubens had pioneered the &quot;trois crayons&quot; drawing technique, to achieve a naturalistic effect by using the colors black, red and white. He used this technique often in his portraits. While Jordaens relied on black chalk studies in his early career he later also adopted the &quot;trois crayons&quot; technique in his drawings from life. Jordaens was very thrifty with his paper and often reused pieces of paper. He often enlarged a drawing at once or later by transferring it to a larger sheet or adding strips of paper.

==Prints==
Jordaens was also engaged in the print publishing business as an organiser and designer of prints. Like Rubens and van Dyck before him, he realised the important role the print medium could play in distributing his work and raising his international fame. This was particularly the case as he was working in Antwerp, one of the most important printing centres of Europe at the time.
About 34 prints made or designed by Jordaens are currently known. The first print published after a design by Jordaens may have been &quot;The Satyr and the Peasant&quot; engraved by Lucas Vorsterman the Elder, a prominent printmaker who had been Rubens&#x27; dedicated engraver. The print was made after Jordaens&#x27; painting of the same name which is dated to about 1621 and is now in the Goteborg Museum. Although Vorsterman likely took the initiative to make the print, Jordaens is believed to have assisted in its production.

An important portion of prints made after Jordaens&#x27; designs were produced on his own initiative between c. 1635 and c. 1645. No painting or drawing connected with any of the 14 engravings in this group can be securely dated after 1645. They were engraved by a number of engravers active in Antwerp including Marinus Robyn van der Goes, Schelte a Bolswert, Paulus Pontius, Jacob Neefs, Pieter de Jode II and Nicolaes Lauwers. Almost all of the prints carry in the lower margin below the image, the name of Jordaens as inventor to the left and the name of the engraver to the right, the Latin words &#x27;cum privilegio&#x27; in the centre, and a short explanation of the image in Latin verse. An additional group of six prints was published with publishers other than Jordaens. Jordaens designed a few of these prints at the request of the publisher Martinus van den Enden. This is the case with the &quot;Christ before Caiaphas&quot; engraved by Marinus Robyn van der Goes and the &quot;Christ before Pilate&quot; by Jacob Neefs. Pieter de Jode II&#x27;s &quot;The Fool, the Woman and the Owl&quot; and Alexander Voet the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Old Fool with a Cat&quot; were likely published without personal interference by Jordaens. Another print by Pieter de Jode II, a reproduction of a self-portrait by Jordaens was engraved for Joannes Meyssens&#x27; &quot;Images des diverses hommes&quot;, a publication with engraved portraits of many famous men published in 1649. Hendrick Snyers reproduced Jordaens&#x27; portrait of his father in law Adam van Noort for the same publication.
Some art historians have conjectured that seven etchings made after paintings by Jordaens had been etched by Jordaens himself as the early impressions of these prints only carry the inscription ‘Iac. Iordaens inventor 1652’ without a reference to the engraver. It has recently been suggested that these prints are more likely to be the work of the Antwerp printmaker Remoldus Eynhoudt who had trained under the same master as Jordaens. The grounds for the revised attribution is that the said prints do not show the typical features of Jordaens&#x27; style as displayed in his paintings and drawings but rather exhibit the characteristics and weaknesses of Eynhoudt&#x27;s known oeuvre. They were undoubtedly produced in 1652, as the inscriptions state. A majority of them are related to painted or drawn compositions of Jordaens dating to the late 1640s or around 1650 such as the print &quot; Mercury and Argus&quot; It is likely that Jordaens took the initiative to have these etchings made after his works.

Jordaens had a particularly close collaboration with the printmaker Marinus Robyn van der Goes who as a result created many prints after his works such as the &quot;Heracles and Cacus&quot;. Jordaens regularly prepared the prints after his own designs by creating drawings on paper, which are referred to as ‘modelletti’. They were executed in pen, ink and wash, heightened with body colour, often over a preparatory sketch in black chalk. In a few cases, the drawings were laid down on canvas to be sold as cabinet paintings.

<doc id="192488" wikidata="Q68631" url="?curid=192488" title="Rogier van der Weyden">
<text>Rogier van der Weyden (; 1399 or 140018 June 1464), initially known as Roger de le Pasture (), was an early Netherlandish painter whose surviving works consist mainly of religious triptychs, altarpieces, and commissioned single and diptych portraits. He was highly successful in his lifetime; his paintings were exported to Italy and Spain, and he received commissions from, amongst others, Philip the Good, Netherlandish nobility, and foreign aristocrats. By the latter half of the 15th century, he had eclipsed Jan van Eyck in popularity. However his fame lasted only until the 17th century, and largely due to changing taste, he was almost totally forgotten by the mid-18th century. His reputation was slowly rebuilt during the 200 years that followed; today he is known, with Robert Campin and van Eyck, as the third (by birth date) of the three great Early Netherlandish artists (&quot;Vlaamse Primitieven&quot; or &quot;Flemish Primitives&quot;), and widely as the most influential Northern painter of the 15th century.

Very few details of van der Weyden&#x27;s life are known. The few facts we know come from fragmentary civic records. Yet the attribution of paintings now associated to him is widely accepted, partly on the basis of circumstantial evidence, but primarily on the stylistic evidence of a number of paintings by an innovative master.

Van der Weyden worked from life models, and details were closely observed. Yet he often idealised certain elements of his models&#x27; facial features, who were typically statuesque, especially in his triptychs. All of his forms are rendered with rich, warm colourisation and a sympathetic expression, while he is known for his expressive pathos and naturalism. His portraits tend to be half length and half profile, and he is as sympathetic here as in his religious triptychs. Van der Weyden used an unusually broad range of colours and varied tones; in his finest work the same tone is not repeated in any other area of the canvas, so even the whites are varied.

==Early life and apprenticeship==

Due to the loss of archives in 1695 and again in 1940, there are few certain facts of van der Weyden&#x27;s life. Rogelet de le Pasture (Roger of the Pasture) was born in Tournai (in present-day Belgium) in 1399 or 1400. His parents were Henri de le Pasture and Agnes de Wattrélos. The Pasture family had earlier settled in the city of Tournai where Rogier&#x27;s father worked as a &quot;maître-coutelier&quot; (knife manufacturer).

In 1426, Rogier married Elisabeth, the daughter of a Brussels shoemaker, Jan Goffaert and his wife Cathelyne van Stockem. Rogier and Elisabeth had four children, the first being Cornelius (b. 1427), who became a Carthusian monk and Margaretha, born in 1432. By 21 October 1435, the family had settled in Brussels, where the two younger children were born: Pieter in 1437 and Jan in 1438. These latter two would go on to become respectively a painter and a goldsmith. On moving to Brussels, Rogier began using the Flemish version of his name: &quot;Rogier van der Weyden&quot;.

From 2 March 1436 onward, Rogier held the title of &#x27;painter to the town of Brussels&#x27; (&quot;stadsschilder&quot;), a very prestigious post since Brussels was at that time the most important residence of the splendid court of the Dukes of Burgundy.
Little is known about Rogier&#x27;s training as a painter. The archival sources from Tournai were completely destroyed during World War II, but had been partly transcribed in the 19th and early 20th century. The sources on his early life are confusing and have led to different interpretations by scholars. It is known that the city council of Tournai offered eight pitchers of wine in honour of a certain &#x27;Maistre Rogier de le Pasture&#x27; on 17 November 1426.

However, on 5 March of the following year, the records of the painters&#x27; guild show a &quot;Rogelet de le Pasture&quot; entered the workshop of Robert Campin together with Jacques Daret. Records show that de le Pasture was already established as a painter. Only five years later, on the first of August 1432, de le Pasture obtained the title of a &quot;Master&quot; (&quot;Maistre&quot;) painter.

His later entry into apprenticeship might be explained by the fact that during the 1420s the city of Tournai was in crisis and as a result the guilds were not functioning normally. The late apprenticeship may have been a legal formality. Also Jacques Daret was then in his twenties and had been living and working in Campin&#x27;s household for at least a decade. It is possible that Rogier obtained an academic title (Master) before he became a painter and that he was awarded the wine of honour on the occasion of his graduation. The sophisticated and learned iconographical and compositional qualities of the paintings attributed to him are sometimes used as an argument in favour of this supposition.

The social and intellectual status of Rogier in his later life surpassed that of a mere craftsman at that time. In general, the close stylistic link between the documented works of Jacques Daret and the paintings attributed to Robert Campin and van der Weyden are the main arguments to consider Rogier van der Weyden as a pupil of Campin.

==Acclaim in Brussels==

The final mention of Rogier de la Pasture in the financial records of Tournai, on 21 October 1435, lists him as &quot;demeurrant à Brouxielles&quot; (&quot;living in Brussels&quot;). At the same time, the first mention of Rogier de Weyden places him as the official painter of Brussels. It is this fact that puts de la Pasture and van der Weyden as one and the same painter. The post of city painter was created especially for Van der Weyden and was meant to lapse on his death. It was linked to a huge commission to paint four justice scenes for the &quot;Golden Chamber&quot; of Brussels City Hall.

Different properties and investments are documented and witness his material prosperity. The portraits he painted of the Burgundian Dukes, their relatives and courtiers, demonstrate a close relationship with the elite of the Netherlands. Whilst Rogier van der Weyden became increasingly wealthy, he also gave generously in alms to the poor. Further testimony of his philanthropy is van der Weyden&#x27;s position as administrator of the hospital and charitable foundation Ter Kisten of the Beguine convent in Brussels between 1455 and 1457.
The Miraflores Altarpiece was probably commissioned by King Juan II of Castile, since Juan II donated it to the monastery of Miraflores in 1445.
According to some sources, in 1449 Rogier went to Italy, and in the holy year 1450 quite possibly made a pilgrimage to Rome, which brought him in contact with Italian artists and patrons. However, his Italian experiences had no influence on his style. The House of Este and the Medici family commissioned paintings from him. After interventions from both the Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin of France, the future Louis XI, Rogier van der Weyden was persuaded to accept the request of Bianca Maria Visconti, Duchess of Milan, that her court painter Zanetto Bugatto go to Brussels to become an apprentice in his workshop.

Rogier&#x27;s international reputation increased progressively. In the 1450s and 1460s humanist scholars such as Nicolas Cusanus, Filarete and Bartolomeo Facio referred to him in superlatives: &#x27;the greatest&#x27;, &#x27;the most noble&#x27; of painters.

Van der Weyden died on 18 June 1464 at Brussels, and was buried in St. Catherine&#x27;s Chapel of the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula.

==Attribution==
No single work can be attributed with certainty to van der Weyden on 15th-century documentary evidence alone. However, Lorne Campbell has stated that three well-authenticated paintings are known, but each has been doubted or underestimated. The best documented is &quot;The Descent from the Cross&quot; in the , Madrid. Campbell points out that this painting&#x27;s provenance can be traced in some detail from the 16th century. Originally hung in the church Notre-Dame-hors-des-Murs in Leuven, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; was sent to the King of Spain. While the ship on which it was travelling sank, the painting fortunately floated, and careful packaging meant that it was scarcely damaged. A copy of the masterpiece by Michel Coxcie was donated to the people of Leuven to replace the original sent to Spain. The &quot;Triptych of the Virgin&quot; or &quot;Miraflores Altarpiece&quot;, since 1850 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, was given in 1445 to the Charterhouse of Miraflores near Burgos by John II of Castile; it was described in the deed of gift as the work of great and famous &quot;Flandresco Rogel&quot;. The &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, now in the Escorial Palace, was donated by Rogier to the Charterhouse of Scheut outside Brussels. In his catalogue raisonné of van der Weyden, the Belgian art historian Dirk de Vos agrees with Campbell about the authenticity of these three paintings.

Rogier&#x27;s apprenticeship under Campin instilled a number of preoccupations, most noticeably his approach to feminine beauty, which was often expressed both through the elegant form of the model herself as well as her dress. Both painters positioned their models within strong diagonal lines, rendered either through headdress or folds of surrounding draperies or cloth. Both emphasised the vivacity of their model&#x27;s character by contrasting them against dark flat backgrounds and throwing strong light from the near left hand side. Campbell compares Campin&#x27;s &quot;Thief&quot; with Rogier&#x27;s Prado &quot;The Descent from the Cross&quot; in their emotional depictions of anguish. The resemblance was to such an extent – compare Campin&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Woman&quot;&#x27;s similarity to Rogier&#x27;s Berlin portrait – that Campin&#x27;s works were for a period attributed to Rogier&#x27;s early career.

Châtelet illustrates how subsequent generations of art historians have conflated and confused Rogier van der Weyden&#x27;s identity, thereby mis-attributing works of art. It can be traced back to a geographical error in Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Vite de&#x27; più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori&quot; where he states that the artist &#x27;Rugiero da Brugia&#x27; lived in Bruges. Van Mander, who knew that Rogier van der Weyden resided in Brussels, read Vasari&#x27;s text and believed that there were two different artists with the same name, who both appear separately in his &quot;Schilder-boeck&quot; of 1604. Châtelet explains how the Brussels archivist Alphonse Walters discovered in 1846 that there was a Rogier van der Weyden who lived in Brussels but that he had died earlier than stated in the &quot;Schilder-Boeck&quot;; this led Alfred Michiels to claim that there were two Rogier van der Weyden painters, a father and son. A further complication arose at the end of the 19th century when William Bode and Hugo von Tschudi attributed a group of works of art to the &quot;Maître de Flémalle&quot;; despite discrepancies, these works are similar to those of Van der Weyden and so it was believed that these works were in fact by Rogier and that he was the &quot;Maître de Flémalle&quot;. It was only in 1913 that Hulin de Loo indicated that these works were actually painted by Rogier&#x27;s teacher Robert Campin. There was still a divide in critical opinion over whether there was one Rogier van der Weyden or two artists, the other being Rogier de la Pasture of Tournai, until Erwin Panofsky wrote his definitive work in 1953 &quot;Early Netherlandish Painting&quot; and established that there was only one painter with two names.

==Work==

Relatively few works are attributed to van der Weyden&#x27;s relatively long career, but this does not mean he was un-prolific, more that it is likely that many have been lost. Nonetheless, he had a very well defined style, and the majority of the attributions are generally accepted. Van der Weyden left no self-portraits. However it has been suggested that he painted a self-portrait into one of the Justice panels, which was subsequently copied into the Bern tapestry. A drawing with the inscription &quot;Recueil d&#x27;Arras&quot; is also said to depict Van der Weyden.

Many of his most important works were destroyed during the late 17th century. He is first mentioned in historical records in 1427 when, relatively late in life, he studied painting under Campin during 1427–32, and soon outshone his master and, later, even influenced him. After his apprenticeship, he was made master of the Tournai Guild of St Luke. He moved to Brussels in 1435, where he quickly established his reputation for his technical skill and emotional use of line and colour. He completed his Deposition in 1435, which as he had deliberately intended, made him one of the most sought after and influential artists in northern Europe and is still considered his masterpiece.

The fragment of the London National Gallery&#x27;s &quot;The Magdalen Reading&quot; has been described by Campbell as &quot;one of the great masterpieces of fifteenth-century art and among Rogier&#x27;s most important early works&quot;. Since the 1970s, this painting has been linked to two small heads in the collection of the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum (Lisbon), of Saint Catherine and of St Joseph. It is now widely believed that these three fragments came from the same large altarpiece depicting the &quot;Virgin and Child with Saints&quot;, partly recorded in a later drawing now in Stockholm. At some unknown date before 1811, this altarpiece was carved up into these three fragments.
The lost &quot;The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald&quot;, which survived until the end of the 17th century, consisted of four large panels representing the &quot;Justice of Trajan&quot; and &quot;Justice of Herkenbald&quot;. These were commissioned by the City of Brussels for the &quot;Gulden Camere&quot; (Golden Chamber) of the Brussels Town Hall. The first and third panels were signed, and the first dated 1439. All four were finished before 1450. They were destroyed in the French Bombardment of Brussels in 1695, but are known from many surviving descriptions, from a free partial copy in tapestry (Bern, Historisches Museum) and from other free and partial copies in drawing and painting. The paintings probably measured about 4.5 m each, which was an enormous scale for a painting on panel at that time. They served as &#x27;examples of justice&#x27; for the aldermen of the city who had to speak justice in this room. The paintings were praised or described by a series of commentators until their destruction, including Dürer (1520), Vasari (1568), Molanus (–1580), and Baldinucci (1688).

In his commissioned portraits, van der Weyden typically flattered his sitters. He often idealised or softened their facial features, allowing them a handsomeness or beauty, or interest or intelligence they might not have been blessed with in life. He often enlargened the eyes, better defined the contours of the face, and gave a much stronger jaw than the subject may have possessed in life. Among his most celebrated portraits are those of Philip the Good, his third wife Isabella of Portugal and their son Charles the Bold.

==Influence==

His vigorous, subtle, expressive painting and popular religious conceptions had considerable influence on European painting, not only in France and Germany but also in Italy and in Spain. Panofsky writes how Rogier van der Weyden introduced new religious iconography in his painting; he depicted patrons participating in sacred events and combined half-portraits of the Madonna with portraits of people in prayer to form diptychs. He also reformulated and popularised the subject of Saint Jerome removing the thorn from the lion&#x27;s paw.

Hans Memling was his greatest follower, although it is not proven that he studied under Rogier. Van der Weyden had also a large influence on the German painter and engraver Martin Schongauer whose prints were distributed all over Europe from the last decades of the 15th century. Indirectly Schongauer&#x27;s prints helped to disseminate van der Weyden&#x27;s style. Delenda writes that, with the exception of Petrus Christus, who was a disciple of Jan van Eyck, traces of Rogier van der Weyden&#x27;s art can be found in all fifteenth-century artists to varying degrees.

<text>Rheinhessen-Pfalz (rarely anglicized as &quot;Rhine-Hesse-Palatinate&quot;) was one of the three &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; of Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, located in the south of the state. It was created in 1968 out of &quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot; Rheinhessen and Pfalz, which had themselves been created out of the left-bank territories of Bavaria and Hesse-Darmstadt before World War II.

Since 2000, the employees and assets of the Bezirksregierungen form the &quot;Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion Trier&quot; (Supervisory and Service Directorate Trier) and the &quot;Struktur- und Genehmigungsdirektionen&quot; (Structural and Approval Directorates) &quot;Nord&quot; in Koblenz and &quot;Süd&quot; in Neustadt (Weinstraße). These administrations execute their authority over the whole state, &quot;e.g.&quot; the &quot;ADD Trier&quot; oversees all schools.

<text>Bristol Zoo was a zoo in the city of Bristol in South West England. The zoo&#x27;s stated mission was to &quot;maintain and defend&quot; biodiversity through breeding endangered species, conserving threatened species and habitats and promoting a wider understanding of the natural world&quot;.

The mammal collection at the zoo numbered around 300, representing 50 species, including: gorillas, Asiatic lions, goodfellow&#x27;s tree-kangaroo, and red pandas. Among species on view at Bristol which are rare or absent in other UK zoos were Livingstone&#x27;s fruit bats, aye ayes and quolls.

The zoo&#x27;s Twilight Zone was the first of its kind when it opened, there were many other indoor exhibits including an insect and reptile house and aquarium meanwhile outside there were several aviaries and a seal and penguin enclosure. The lakes&#x27; islands were home to gorillas, golden lion tamarins, golden-headed lion tamarins, gibbons and squirrel monkeys.

The Zoo announced on 27 November 2020 that after more than 186 years its main centre in Clifton would close in 2022, with its animals moving to its Wild Place Project site close to the M5 motorway and the zoo reopening there in early 2024. In the event, it closed its gates for the last time on 3 September 2022. The site is being redeveloped for housing. It was listed as an asset of community value in 2021.

==Animal exhibits==

* Seal and Penguin Coasts was a major attraction at the zoo; opened in 1999, it allowed South American fur seals and African penguins to be watched both above and below the water. The most notable of these African Penguins being CGP Grey the penguin named after internet personality CGP Grey, CGP Grey the penguin died in 2017 (No exact date was given but was first reported on 13 May 2017). The two pools contained of salt water, with waves, waterfalls, rocks and pebble beaches to simulate the natural habitat. The exhibit had a large net over the top to allow Inca terns and common eiders to be kept in the same enclosure.
* Gorilla Island was home to a family of western lowland gorillas. One silverback, Jock as well as Kera, Kala and Touni. In February 2016, Kera&#x27;s first baby Afia was born after an emergency caesarean section. In April 2017, Touni gave birth to baby Ayana. In August 2020, Kala gave birth to a baby Hasani. Also in December 2020, Touni gave birth to her second baby called Juni. As well as an indoor house, they had a large island. Despite the gorilla&#x27;s herbivorous diet, keepers did not enter the same space as the apes. This is because not only is there a great risk of injury with these powerful primates, but they also wanted to let the gorillas socialize on their own without human interference.
* The Top Terrace was one of the oldest parts of the zoo. It was home to a pair of Asiatic lions, keas, red pandas, Livingstone&#x27;s fruit bats, and Greater Flamingos.
* The Reptile House housed a collection of reptiles and amphibians. The house itself was heated and gave a sense of the heat of the rainforest. There were three sections to the house: Desert (Gila monsters, geckos and tortoises), Rainforest (dwarf crocodiles, terrapins and snakes) and the Rearing Room where visitors could view the raising of reptiles and amphibian and also learn about the zoo&#x27;s conservation work. Outside, but still considered part of the reptile house, was a giant tortoise and rhinoceros iguana enclosure where the animals had access to a heated indoor house and an outdoor enclosure.
* The Aquarium had around 70 species of fish. The aquarium had three sections: The Amazon River (catfish, pacu and piranha), Africa (cichlids) and the coral reef (seahorses, corals and various species of fish). On the outside of the building there was a water sculpture. There were several exhibits of conservation significance on view. Notably, there was a display of endangered cichlids from Lake Barombi Mbo in Cameroon and a display of goodeids from Mexico and paddlefish and alligator gar from North America.
* Bug World, was the zoo&#x27;s collection of invertebrates, includes species such as &quot;Partula&quot; snails, stick and leaf insects and corals. Other displays included tarantulas, giant millipedes, honey bees, leaf-cutting ants and Lord Howe Island stick insects. Bug World also housed the Critically Endangered Desertas Wolf Spider. Previous displays included peacock mantis shrimp and black widow spiders.
* Monkey Jungle opened in 2006 and featured four new exhibits replacing the old monkey house. An enclosure was home to crowned lemurs and ring-tailed lemurs where visitors could walk in with the lemurs without any boundaries. The other enclosures were home to brown spider monkeys and lion-tailed macaques. There was also a nearby enclosure for black howler monkeys and six-banded armadillos. The islands opposite Gorilla Island housed a family of squirrel monkeys, a pair of agile gibbons and also golden-headed lion tamarins.
* The Butterfly House was made up of an undercover walk-through in a sustainably-heated, climate-controlled polytunnel. . Species on show included the blue morpho butterflies, glasswings, leopard lacewings and atlas moths. The exhibit was linked to sustainable butterfly producers in Costa Rica. The zoo also supported work to protect the rare silky wave moth in Avon Gorge.

==History==
Opened in 1836 by the Bristol, Clifton and West of England Zoological Society, Bristol Zoo was the world&#x27;s oldest provincial zoo. It was a Victorian walled zoo located between Clifton Down and Clifton College, near Brunel&#x27;s Clifton Suspension Bridge; it covered a small area by modern standards, but with a considerable number of species. In the 1960s the zoo came to national prominence by appearing in the UK television series, &quot;Animal Magic&quot;, hosted by the comic animal &#x27;communicator&#x27;, Johnny Morris. Morris would play keeper and voice all the animals there.

The zoo&#x27;s official name was Bristol Zoological Gardens (&#x27;Bristol Zoo Gardens&#x27; for commercial purposes). This was not in recognition of the flower displays but recognises the first use of that title at the Regent&#x27;s Park Zoological Gardens. Bristol, like its earlier London counterpart, included several original buildings which have been praised for their architectural quirks, despite being unsuitable for the care of animals; the (former) Giraffe House joined the main entrance lodge and the south gates on Guthrie Road as a Grade II listed building. The old Monkey Temple, resembling a southern Asian temple, was home to an exhibit called &quot;Smarty plants&quot;, an interactive exhibit which shows how plants use and manipulate animals to survive.

The zoo also has breeding firsts, including the first black rhino born in Britain in 1958, the first squirrel monkey born in captivity in 1953 and the first chimpanzee born in Europe in 1934.

==Conservation==
Bristol Zoological Society (BZS) supports wildlife conservation, education and breeding programmes worldwide. For example, Bristol worked with other zoos around the world to breed lemurs in captivity. Native to Madagascar, the lemurs are critically endangered because their forest habitat is being destroyed.

Similarly, BZS supports the UK–US charity Ape Action Africa, which rescues and rehabilitates primates in Cameroon, West Africa. Closer to home, the zoo helped to reintroduce the water vole and the white-clawed crayfish to parts of Southern England. They also had conservation projects for Kordofan giraffe, Agalychnis lemur, Negros bleeding-heart pigeon, Sanje Mangabey and Hogna ingens

In 2021, as part of the Bristol Zoological Society&#x27;s focus on conservation, the zoo has been involved in the ongoing captive breeding program to rescue two species of critically endangered Madeiran land snail, (&quot;Discula lyelliana&quot; and &quot;Geomitra grabhami&quot;). Since the early 20th century, the snails were believed to be extinct, but remnant populations were rediscovered in 2013.

==Wild Place Project==
The Wild Place Project is designed to house larger animals than the former Bristol Zoo. The zoo is split into biomes, representing species found only in specific habitats. Current areas include: Bear wood, Gelada rocks, Discover Madagascar and Benoue National Park. The species list currently includes red river hog, cheetah, zebra, common eland, meerkat, gelada baboon, reticulated giraffe, wolverine, eurasian lynx, grey wolf, brown bear, Visayan spotted deer, Ostrich and the newest red panda. 

The new conservation breeding centre will include Annam leaf turtle, Lesser Antillean iguana, Pancake Tortoise, Radiated tortoise, Roti Island snake-necked turtle, Indochinese box turtle, Agalychnis lemur, Leptodactylus fallax, Marshall&#x27;s pygmy chameleon, Lygodactylus williamsi, Varanus macraei, Uroplatus, Hogna ingens, Polynesian tree snail, Lord Howe Island stick insect, Socorro dove, Visayan tarictic hornbill, Sumatran laughingthrush, Philippine cockatoo, Javan green magpie, European turtle dove, Mindanao bleeding-heart, Negros bleeding-heart pigeon, pink pigeon, Malagasy cichlids, Malagasy rainbow fish and powder blue panchax, Pupfish and goodeids and White clawed crayfish.

Finally, there will be a new entrance with a new café, new gift shop and new entry exhibits.

The site officially opened on 22 July 2013 as Wild Place Project.

Future plans include a Bristol Zoo-managed conservation breeding centre with climate-controlled enclosures, learning centre and conservation medicine centre.

=== Closure ===
In 2020, BZS announced that Bristol Zoo Gardens would close in 2022 and the Wild Place Project will become the new Bristol zoo in early 2024 and will be home to new exhibits:

* Western lowland gorilla, collared mangabey, African grey parrots, slender-snouted crocodiles, Okapi and Mandrill will be in a new central African rainforest area.
* The Eastern black rhinoceros and Ostrich will join the giraffe, zebra, eland, red river hog and cheetah in the Benoue National Park area.

==Event hosting==
The WOMAD music festival came to the zoo in 2011, with a subsequent event in 2012.

<text>Planetesimals () are solid objects thought to exist in protoplanetary disks and debris disks. Believed to have formed in the Solar System about 4.6 billion years ago, they aid study of its formation.

== Formation ==
A widely accepted theory of planet formation, the planetesimal hypothesis of Viktor Safronov, states that planets form from cosmic dust grains that collide and stick to form ever-larger bodies. Once a body reaches around a kilometer in size, its constituent grains can attract each other directly through mutual gravity, enormously aiding further growth into moon-sized protoplanets. Smaller bodies must instead rely on Brownian motion or turbulence to cause the collisions leading to sticking. The mechanics of collisions and mechanisms of sticking are intricate. Alternatively, planetesimals may form in a very dense layer of dust grains that undergoes a collective gravitational instability in the mid-plane of a protoplanetary disk—or via the concentration and gravitational collapse of swarms of larger particles in streaming instabilities. Many planetesimals eventually break apart during violent collisions, as 4 Vesta and 90 Antiope may have, but a few of the largest ones may survive such encounters and grow into protoplanets and, later, planets.

== Planetesimals in the Solar System ==
It has been inferred that about 3.8 billion years ago, after a period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, most of the planetesimals within the Solar System had either been ejected from the Solar System entirely, into distant eccentric orbits such as the Oort cloud, or had collided with larger objects due to the regular gravitational nudges from the giant planets (particularly Jupiter and Neptune). A few planetesimals may have been captured as moons, such as Phoebe (a moon of Saturn) and many other small high-inclination moons of the giant planets.

Planetesimals that have survived to the current day are valuable to science because they contain information about the formation of the Solar System. Although their exteriors are subjected to intense solar radiation that can alter their chemistry, their interiors contain pristine material essentially untouched since the planetesimal was formed. This makes each planetesimal a &#x27;time capsule&#x27;, and their composition might reveal the conditions in the Solar Nebula from which our planetary system was formed. The most primitive planetesimals visited by spacecraft are the contact binary Arrokoth.

==Definition of planetesimal==

The word &quot;planetesimal&quot; is derived from the word infinitesimal and means an ultimately small fraction of a planet. 

While the name is always applied to small bodies during the &quot;process&quot; of planet formation, some scientists also use the term planetesimal as a general term to refer to many small Solar System bodies – such as asteroids and comets – which are left over from the formation process. A group of the world&#x27;s leading planet formation experts decided at a conference in 2006 on the following definition of a planetesimal:

A planetesimal is a solid object arising during the accumulation of orbiting bodies whose internal strength is dominated by self-gravity and whose orbital dynamics is not significantly affected by gas drag. This corresponds to objects larger than approximately 1 km in the solar nebula.

Bodies large enough not only to keep together by gravitation but to change the path of approaching rocks over distances of several radii start to grow faster. These bodies, larger than 100 km to 1000 km, are called embryos or protoplanets.

In the current Solar System, these small bodies are usually also classified by dynamics and composition, and may have subsequently evolved
to become comets, Kuiper belt objects or trojan asteroids, for example. In other words, some planetesimals &quot;became&quot; other types of body once planetary formation had finished, and may be referred to by either or both names.

The above definition is not endorsed by the International Astronomical Union, and other working groups may choose to adopt the same or a different definition. The dividing line between a planetesimal and protoplanet is typically framed in terms of the size and the stages of development that the potential planet has already gone through: planetesimals combine to form a protoplanet, and protoplanets continue to grow (faster than planetesimals).

Born in the Middle Rhine region, he probably spent his childhood in Mainz. During his apprenticeship as a painter he moved to the Netherlands and spent time in the Brussels workshop of Rogier van der Weyden. In 1465 he was made a citizen of Bruges, where he became one of the leading artists and the master of a large workshop. A tax document from 1480 lists him among the wealthiest citizens. Memling&#x27;s religious works often incorporated donor portraits of the clergymen, aristocrats, and burghers (bankers, merchants, and politicians) who were his patrons. These portraits built upon the styles which Memling learned in his youth.

He married Anna de Valkenaere sometime between 1470 and 1480, and they had three children. Memling&#x27;s art was rediscovered in the 19th century, attaining wide popularity.

==Life and works==
Born in Seligenstadt, near Frankfurt in the Middle Main region, Memling served his apprenticeship at Mainz or Cologne and later worked in the Low Countries under Rogier van der Weyden () in Brussels, Duchy of Brabant. He then worked at Bruges, County of Flanders by 1465.He painted for the Hospitallers in 1479 and 1480. In 1477, when he was believed dead, he was under contract to create an altarpiece for the gild-chapel of the booksellers of Bruges. This altarpiece, &quot;Scenes of the Passion of Christ&quot;, is now in the Galleria Sabauda of Turin. &quot;The Last Judgment&quot;, which had been in Gdańsk since 1473 is now in the National Museum there. &quot;The Last Judgment&quot; was commissioned by Angelo Tani, erstwhile director of the Bruges branch of the Medici Bank, for a chapel at what is now the Badia Fiesolana in Fiesole. When the triptych is closed Tani and his wife are shown kneeling in prayer. It was shipped to Fiesole on a vessel that was captured by Danzig privateer Paul Beneke in April 1473.

The oldest allusions to pictures connected to Memling point to his relations with the Burgundian court, which was held in Brussels. The inventories of Margaret of Austria, drawn up in 1524, allude to a triptych of the &quot;God of Pity&quot; by Rogier van der Weyden, of which the wings containing angels were painted by &quot;Master Hans&quot;.

Memling&#x27;s painting of John the Baptist (c. 1470) is in the Munich Alte Pinakothek. He painted the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in Gdańsk.

Memling&#x27;s portraits, in particular, were popular in Italy. According to Paula Nuttall, Memling&#x27;s distinctive contribution to portraiture was his use of landscape backgrounds, characterized by &quot;a balanced counterpoint between top and bottom, foreground and background: the head offset by the neutral expanse of sky, and the neutral area of the shoulders enlivened by the landscape detail beyond&quot;. Memling&#x27;s portrait style influenced the work of numerous late-15th-century Italian painters, and is evident in works such as Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena Doni&quot;. Purchasers of his paintings include Cardinal Grimani and Cardinal Bembo at Venice, and the heads of the House of Medici at Florence.

Other paintings include the &quot;Madonna and Saints&quot; (which passed from the Duchatel collection to the Louvre), the &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; (painted for Sir John Donne and now at the National Gallery, London), and the four attributed portraits in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence (including the &quot;Portrait of Folco Portinari&quot;), the &quot;Scenes from the Passion of Christ&quot; in the Galleria Sabauda of Turin and the &quot;Advent and Triumph of Christ&quot;

Around 1492, Memling was commissioned to paint the Najera Altarpiece for the Benedictine Monastery of Santa Maria la Real in Najera, Rioja, Spain. The altarpiece, which was completed in Flanders, consisted of an image of God surrounded by angels playing a variety of musical instruments while atop a row of clouds before a golden background. Recent scholarship by Bart Fransen has determined that Gonzalo de Cabredo and Abbot Pablo Martinez commissioned the creation of this artwork.

Memling became sufficiently prosperous that his name appears on a list of the 875 richest citizens of Bruges who were obligatory subscribers to the loan raised by Maximilian I of Austria, to finance hostilities towards France in 1480. Memling&#x27;s name does not appear on subsequent subscription lists of this type.

In his later years, he painted the Shrine of St Ursula in the museum of the hospital of Bruges, &quot;St Christopher and Saints&quot; (1484) in the academy, the &quot;Diptych of Maarten van Nieuwenhove&quot; in the hospital of Bruges, and a large &quot;Crucifixion,&quot; with scenes from the Passion, (1491) from the Lübeck Cathedral (Dom) of Lübeck, now in Lübeck&#x27;s &quot;St. Annen Museum&quot;. Near the close of Memling&#x27;s career, the registers of the painters&#x27; guild at Bruges give the names of two apprentices who served their time with Memling and paid dues on admission to the guild in 1480 and 1486.

He died in Bruges. The trustees of his will appeared before the court of wards at Bruges on 10 December 1495, and records indicate Memling left behind several children and considerable property.

==Memling carpets==
There are four works by Memling that feature an oriental carpet. They are the &quot;triptych with the Virgin and Child Enthroned&quot; (Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum), the &quot;triptych of John Donne&quot; (London, National Gallery), the &quot;Virgin and Child Enthroned with a large family&quot; (Paris, Louvre), and the &quot;Flowers in a jug&quot; (Madrid, Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum). They all feature an indefinitely repeated pattern that is representative of an archaic strand of ornamentation in Turkoman carpets from Anatolia and Armenia. This type of carpet is named after Memling and is known as Memling carpets. They are characterized by guls with &quot;hooked&quot; lines radiating from a central body.

<text>Offenbach is a Kreis (district) in the south of Hesse, Germany and is part of the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring districts are Main-Kinzig, Aschaffenburg, Darmstadt-Dieburg, Groß-Gerau and the cities of Darmstadt, Frankfurt and Offenbach.

==History==

The district Offenbach was first formed in 1832 when the previous &quot;Landratsbezirke&quot; Langen (partially), Seligenstadt and Offenbach were merged. In 1852 the district area was enlarged in a westerly direction, while some of the southern part was moved into the district of Dieburg. In 1938 the area of the Frankfurt airport was added to the district, and the city Offenbach left the district to become a district-free city. However the seat of administration stayed in Offenbach.

After two minor changes in 1942 and 1974, in 1977 the district was given its current borders, and also the municipalities in the district were merged to 10 cities and 3 municipalities. In 2002, the capital of the district was moved from Offenbach to Dietzenbach.

==Geography==

A large part of this very urbanised district is wooded. Most towns are part of the Frankfurt urban area. The river Main is a part of the northern border of the district.

==Economy==
In 2015 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €38,469. This places the district 8th out of 26 districts (rural and urban) in Hesse(overall average: €42,732).

==Coat of arms==
The oak tree in the coat of arms symbolize the formerly big oak forests of Dreieich (three oaks). The escutcheon in the middle shows a combination of the coat of arms of the Counts of Isenburg in the left and the Wheel of Mainz in the right, as the districts area belonged to these two counties in the past.

<text>Pedanius Dioscorides (, ; 40–90 AD), &quot;the father of pharmacognosy&quot;, was a Greek physician, pharmacologist, botanist, and author of (in the original , , both meaning &quot;On Medical Material&quot;) , a 5-volume Greek encyclopedic pharmacopeia on herbal medicine and related medicinal substances, that was widely read for more than 1,500 years. For almost two millennia Dioscorides was regarded as the most prominent writer on plants and plant drugs.

==Life==
A native of Anazarbus, Cilicia, Asia Minor, Dioscorides likely studied medicine nearby at the school in Tarsus, which had a pharmacological emphasis, and he dedicated his medical books to Laecanius Arius, a medical practitioner there. Though he writes he lived a &quot;soldier&#x27;s life&quot; or &quot;soldier-like life&quot;, his pharmacopeia refers almost solely to plants found in the Greek-speaking eastern Mediterranean, making it likely that he served in campaigns, or travelled in a civilian capacity, less widely as supposed. The name Pedanius is Roman, suggesting that an aristocrat of that name sponsored him to become a Roman citizen.

==&quot;De materia medica&quot;==
Between AD 50 and 70 Dioscorides wrote a five-volume book in his native Greek, (Perì hylēs íatrikēs), known in Western Europe more often by its Latin title (&quot;On Medical Material&quot;), which became the precursor to all modern pharmacopeias.

In contrast to many classical authors, Dioscorides&#x27; works were not &quot;rediscovered&quot; in the Renaissance, because his book had never left circulation; indeed, with regard to Western &quot;materia medica&quot; through the early modern period, Dioscorides&#x27; text eclipsed the Hippocratic corpus. 

In the medieval period, was circulated in Greek, as well as Latin and Arabic translation.While being reproduced in manuscript form through the centuries, it was often supplemented with commentary and minor additions from Arabic and Indian sources. Ibn al-Baitar&#x27;s commentary on Dioscorides&#x27; , entitled : , has been used by scholars to identify many of the flora mentioned by Dioscorides. 

A number of illustrated manuscripts of survive. The most famous of these is the lavishly illustrated &quot;Vienna Dioscurides&quot;, produced in Constantinople in 512/513 AD. Densely illustrated Arabic copies survive from the 12th and 13th centuries, while Greek manuscripts survive today in the monasteries of Mount Athos.

 is the prime historical source of information about the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian, Thracian, Roman, ancient Egyptian and North African (Carthaginian) names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, although the descriptions are sometimes obscurely phrased, leading to comments such as: &quot;Numerous individuals from the Middle Ages on have struggled with the identity of the recondite kinds&quot;, while some of the botanical identifications of Dioscorides&#x27; plants remain merely guesses.

John Goodyer translated the work into English in 1655, and bequeathed it to Magdalen College, Oxford; it was published by the Oxford University Press in 1934.

== Legacy ==

 formed the core of the European pharmacopeia through the 19th century, suggesting that &quot;the timelessness of Dioscorides&#x27; work resulted from an empirical tradition based on trial and error; that it worked for generation after generation despite social and cultural changes and changes in medical theory&quot;.

The plant genus &quot;Dioscorea&quot;, which includes the yam, was named after him by Linnaeus. 

A butterfly, the bush hopper, &quot;Ampittia dioscorides&quot; which is found from India southeast towards Indonesia and east towards China, is named after him.

<doc id="192516" wikidata="Q901150" url="?curid=192516" title="Shirk (Islam)">
<text>Shirk () in Islam is a sin often roughly translated as &#x27;idolatry&#x27; or &#x27;polytheism&#x27;, but more accurately meaning &#x27;association [with God]&#x27;. It refers to accepting other divinities or powers alongside God as associates. In contrast, Islam teaches that God does not share divine attributes with anyone, as it is disallowed according to the Islamic doctrine of &quot;tawhid.&quot; The Quran, the central religious text of Islam, states in 4:48 that God will not forgive &quot;shirk&quot; if one dies without repenting of it.

The one who commits &quot;shirk&quot; is called a mushrik. The opposite of &quot;shirk&quot; is &quot;tawhid&quot; and the opposite of &quot;mushrik&quot; is &quot;muwahhid&quot;..

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;shirk&quot; comes from the Arabic root sh-r-k (), with the general meaning of &#x27;to share&#x27;.
In the context of the Quran, the particular sense of &#x27;sharing as an equal partner&#x27; is usually understood, so that polytheism means &#x27;attributing a partner to God&#x27;. In the Quran, &quot;shirk&quot; and the related word &quot;mushrikūn&quot; ()—those who commit shirk and plot against Islam—often refer to the enemies of Islam (as in al-Tawbah verses 9:1–15).

==Quran==
According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Quran states twice in An-Nisa verses 48 and 116 that God can forgive all sins save one: &quot;shirk&quot;.

Islamic commentators on the Quran have emphasized that a number of pre-Islamic Arabian deities and jinn, most notably the three goddesses Manat, al-Lat and al-Uzza mentioned in al-Najm, were considered associates of God.

Entities worshipped besides God are called &quot;shurakāʾ&quot; (). After Judgement Day, they will be cast into Hell along with devils and evil jinn, to whom the polytheists are said to sacrifice in order to gain protection.

Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with &quot;kufr&quot; for rejecting Muhammad&#x27;s message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations, and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God&#x27;s unity. The Quranic verse Al-Ma&#x27;idah 5:73 (&quot;Certainly they disbelieve [&quot;kafara&quot;] who say: God is the third of three&quot;), among other verses, has been traditionally understood in Islam as rejection of the Christian Trinity doctrine, but modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations. Other Quranic verses strongly deny the divinity of Jesus Christ, the son of Mary, and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers, who will be doomed to eternal punishment in Hell. The Quran also does not recognise the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself but respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God, who was sent to children of Israel. Some Muslim thinkers such as Mohamed Talbi have viewed the most extreme Qur&#x27;anic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus (Al-Ma&#x27;idah 5:19, 5:75-76, 5:119) as non-Christian formulas, which were rejected by the Church as well.

Cyril Glasse criticises the use of &quot;kafirun&quot; (pl. of &quot;kafir&quot;) to describe Christians as a &quot;loose usage&quot;. According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, traditional Islamic jurisprudence has &quot;ahl al-kitab&quot; being &quot;usually regarded more leniently than other &quot;kuffar&quot; [pl. of &quot;kafir&quot;],&quot; and &quot;in theory,&quot; a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Jew or a Christian, &quot;Thou unbeliever.&quot;

Historically, People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as &quot;dhimmi&quot;, and those who were visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as &quot;musta&#x27;min&quot;. In the Quran Jews and Christians, although accused of believing shared divinity by asserting lineage between God and Ezra or Jesus respectively, are not described as &quot;mushrik&quot;. The term is reserved for pre-Islamic beliefs who associated partners with God. Nonetheless, medieval Muslim philosophers identified belief in the Trinity with &quot;shirk&quot; (&quot;associationism&quot;), by limiting the infinity of God by associating his divinity with physical existence.

==Theological interpretation==
In a theological context, one commits &quot;shirk&quot; by associating some lesser being with God (Allah). The sin is committed if one imagines that there is another power associated with &quot;Allah&quot; as a partner. It is stated in the Quran: &quot;Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him, but He forgives anything else, to whom He pleases, to set up partners with Allah is to devise a sin most heinous indeed&quot; (Quran An-Nisa 4:48).

The term is often translated as &quot;polytheism&quot;, however more complex than the English translation. The term also implies that humans need to renounce claiming divine status for themselves by regarding themselves as better than others. Besides worshipping only one God, it also postulates that God must be considered as entirely unique and condemns anthropomorphization. &quot;Shirk&quot; further implies that God&#x27;s attributes cannot be associated with any other entity or that any other entity can exist independent from God.

=== Forms of &quot;shirk&quot; ===

&quot;Shirk&quot; is classified into two categories:
*&quot;Shirk al-akbar&quot; (; ): open and apparent
*&quot;Shirk al-asghar&quot; or &quot;al-shirk al-khafi&quot; (; ): concealed or hidden. It is when people perform the necessary rituals but not for God but for the sake of others, including social recognition. &quot;Hidden shirk&quot; might be unwitting, yet punishable, although to a lesser extent than greater forms of &quot;shirk&quot;.

=== &quot;Shirk al-akbar&quot; ===
&quot;Shirk al-akbar&quot; is defined as open association and has been described in two forms:
*To associate anything with God
*To associate anything with God&#x27;s attributes

=== &quot;Shirk al-asghar&quot; ===
&quot;Shirk al-asghar&quot; may be committed by one who professes &quot;tawhid&quot;, but for the sake of others.

Mahmud ibn Lubayd reported,
Mahmud ibn Lubayd also said,
Umar ibn al-Khattab narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: &quot;Whoever swears by other than Allah has committed an act of kufr or shirk.&quot; (graded &quot;hasan&quot; by Al-Tirmidhi and &quot;saheeh&quot; by Al-Hakim)

According to Ibn Mas’ood, one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions said: &quot;That I should swear by Allah upon a lie is more preferable to me than that I should swear by another upon the truth.&quot;

== Sufism ==
According to Sufi teachings, to avoid &quot;hidden shirk&quot; (&quot;al-shirk al-khafi&quot;), it is necessary to focus solely on God and give up one&#x27;s own will. 

Some Sufi scholars even go so far as to describe a belief in free will as a form of shirk. According to such an uncompromising view, beliefs usually accommodated within monotheism, such as that in a personal devil (rather than the unregenerate self deficient in God) as the source of evil, or a belief in the concept of free will, are regarded as beliefs in creative powers other than (i.e. standing beside/external to) God, and are thus equated with &quot;shirk&quot;.

Abdullah Ansari describes the highest stage of &quot;tawhid&quot; a human can possess, when the mind becomes fully immersed in the presence of God and understand how all things are put into their proper places.

In Sufism, every action done with an expectation of reward, either in this world or in the hereafter, is considered an act of shirk. Despite that this level of shirk does not entail disbelief, or require repeating the action to follow Islam&#x27;s legal prescriptions, Sufis work on purification until their thoughts are not dominated by any desire except the pure love of God, which results in pure actions of worship.

== Salafism==
Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, founder of the Wahhabi movement, classified &quot;shirk&quot; into three main categories. However, ibn Taymiyya is considered to have been the spiritual founder of this distinction.

* &quot;tawhid al-rububiyyah&quot; (Lordship): the verbal profession that God (Allah) is the sole creator and ruler over the world.
* &quot;tawhid al-Asma wa&#x27;s-Sifat&quot; (names and attributes): accepting the attributes of God as written in the Quran without interpretation.
* &quot;tawhid al-ibada&quot; (servitude): the commitment of religious or spiritual duties to God without intermediaries and that religious or spiritual practises must be limited to Islamic sources.

For abd al-Wahhab, &quot;tawhid al-ibada&quot; was the decisive factor to determine the identity of a Muslim and also the execution of &quot;tawhid al-rububiyyah&quot;. Muslims who violated his interpretation of &quot;tawhid al-ibada&quot; were considered to be &quot;associators&quot; (&quot;mushrikūn&quot;) and &quot;unbelievers&quot; (&quot;kāfirūn&quot;).

<doc id="192517" wikidata="Q212322" url="?curid=192517" title="GSK plc">
<text>GSK plc (an acronym from its former name GlaxoSmithKline plc) is a British multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company with headquarters in London. It was established in 2000 by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, which was itself a merger of a number of pharmaceutical companies around the Smith, Kline &amp; French firm.

GSK is the tenth largest pharmaceutical company and No. 294 on the 2022 &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500, ranked behind other pharmaceutical companies China Resources, Sinopharm, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Roche, AbbVie, Novartis, Bayer, and Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme.

The company has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. As of February 2024, it had a market capitalisation of £69 billion, the eighth largest on the London Stock Exchange.

The company developed the first malaria vaccine, RTS,S, which it said in 2014, it would make available for five per cent above cost. Legacy products developed at GSK include several listed in the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines, such as amoxicillin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine and zidovudine.

In 2012, under prosecution by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) based on combined investigations of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG), FDA and FBI, primarily concerning sales and marketing of the drugs Avandia, Paxil and Wellbutrin, GSK pleaded guilty to promotion of drugs for unapproved uses, failure to report safety data and kickbacks to physicians in the United States and agreed to pay a US$3billion (£1.9bn) settlement. It was the largest health-care fraud case to date in the US and the largest settlement in the pharmaceutical industry.

==History==
===Glaxo Wellcome===
====Glaxo====
Joseph Nathan and Co. was founded in 1873, as a general trading company in Wellington, New Zealand, by a Londoner, Joseph Edward Nathan. In 1904, it began producing a dried-milk baby food from excess milk produced on dairy farms near Bunnythorpe. The resulting product was first known as Defiance, then as Glaxo (from &quot;lacto&quot;), and sold with the slogan &quot;Glaxo builds bonnie babies.&quot; The Glaxo Laboratories sign is still visible on what is now a car repair shop on the main street of Bunnythorpe. The company&#x27;s first pharmaceutical product, released in 1924, was vitamin D.
Glaxo Laboratories was incorporated as a distinct subsidiary company in London in 1935. Joseph Nathan&#x27;s shareholders reorganised the group&#x27;s structure in 1947, making Glaxo the parent and obtained a listing on the London Stock Exchange. Glaxo acquired Allen &amp; Hanburys in 1958. The Scottish pharmacologist David Jack was hired as a researcher for Allen &amp; Hanburys a few years after Glaxo took it over; he went on to lead the company&#x27;s research and development (R&amp;D) until 1987. After Glaxo bought Meyer Laboratories in 1978, it began to play an important role in the US market. In 1983, the American arm, Glaxo Inc., moved to Research Triangle Park (US headquarters/research) and Zebulon (US manufacturing) in North Carolina.

====Burroughs Wellcome====
Burroughs Wellcome &amp; Company was founded in 1880, in London by the American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs. The Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories opened in 1902. In the 1920s, Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York, which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. The Nobel Prize winning scientists Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings worked there and invented drugs still used many years later, such as mercaptopurine. In 1959, the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall &amp; Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health.

When Burroughs Wellcome decided to move its headquarters, the company selected Paul Rudolph to design its new building. The Elion-Hitchings Building &quot;was celebrated worldwide when it was built,&quot; according to Paul Rudolph Heritage Foundation president Kelvin Dickinson. Alex Sayf Cummings of Georgia State University wrote in 2016, that the &quot;iconic building helped define the image of RTP,&quot; saying, &quot;Love it or hate it, Rudolph&#x27;s design remains an impressively audacious creative gesture and an important part of the history of both architecture and Research Triangle Park.&quot; United Therapeutics, which bought the building in 2012, announced plans in 2020, to tear it down.

====Merger====
Glaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995, to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. The merger was then considered the biggest in the UK corporate history. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&amp;D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&amp;D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Also that year, Glaxo Wellcome acquired the California-based Affymax, a leader in the field of combinatorial chemistry.

By 1999, Glaxo Wellcome had become the world&#x27;s third-largest pharmaceutical company by revenues (behind Novartis and Merck), with a global market share of around 4 per cent. Its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999, the company was the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS. It employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world&#x27;s top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&amp;D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent, London and Verona (Italy), and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&amp;D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East.

===SmithKline Beecham===
====Beecham====
In 1848, Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham&#x27;s Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group. In 1859, Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire. By the 1960s, Beecham was extensively involved in pharmaceuticals and consumer products such as Macleans toothpaste, Lucozade and synthetic penicillin research.

====SmithKline====

John K. Smith opened his first pharmacy in Philadelphia in 1830. In 1865, Mahlon Kline joined the business, which 10 years later became Smith, Kline &amp; Co. In 1891, it merged with French, Richard and Company, and in 1929, changed its name to Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories as it focused more on research. Years later it bought Norden Laboratories, a business doing research into animal health, and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques in Belgium in 1963, to focus on vaccines. The company began to expand globally, buying seven laboratories in Canada and the United States in 1969. In 1982, it bought Allergan, a manufacturer of eye and skincare products.

Smith Kline &amp; French merged with Beckman Inc. in 1982, and changed its name to &quot;SmithKline Beckman&quot;. In 1988, it bought International Clinical Laboratories.

====Merger====
In 1989, SmithKline Beckman merged with Beecham Group to form &quot;SmithKline Beecham P.L.C.&quot;. The headquarters moved from the United States to England. To expand R&amp;D in the United States, the company bought a new research center in 1995; another opened in 1997, in England at New Frontiers Science Park, Harlow.

===2000: Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merger===
Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham announced their intention to merge in January 2000. The merger was completed on 27 December that year, forming GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The company&#x27;s global headquarters were at GSK House, Brentford, London, officially opened in 2002, by then-Prime Minister Tony Blair. The building was erected at a cost of £300million and was home to 3,000 administrative staff.

===2001–2010===
GSK completed the acquisition of New Jersey–based Block Drug in 2001, for . In 2006, GSK acquired the US-based consumer healthcare company CNS Inc., whose products included Breathe Right nasal strips and FiberChoice dietary supplements, for US$566million in cash.

Chris Gent, previously CEO of Vodafone, was appointed chairman of the board in 2005. GSK opened its first R&amp;D centre in China in 2007, in Shanghai, initially focused on neurodegenerative diseases. Andrew Witty became the chief executive officer in 2008. Witty joined Glaxo in 1985, and had been president of GSK&#x27;s Pharmaceuticals Europe since 2003.

In 2009, GSK acquired Stiefel Laboratories, then the world&#x27;s largest independent dermatology drug company, for . In November 2009, the FDA approved GSK&#x27;s vaccine for 2009 H1N1 influenza protection, manufactured by the company&#x27;s ID Biomedical Corp in Canada. Also in November 2009, GSK formed a joint venture with Pfizer to create ViiV Healthcare, which specializes in HIV research. In 2010, the company acquired Laboratorios Phoenix, an Argentine pharmaceutical company, for US$253m, and the UK-based sports nutrition company Maxinutrition for £162million (US$256million).

===2011–2022===
In 2011, in a US$660-million deal, Prestige Brands Holdings took over 17 GSK brands with sales of US$210million, including BC Powder, Beano, Ecotrin, Fiber Choice, Goody&#x27;s Powder, Sominex and Tagamet. In 2012, the company announced that it would invest £500million in manufacturing facilities in Ulverston, northern England, designating it as the site for a previously announced biotech plant. In May that year it acquired CellZome, a German biotech company, for US$98million, and in June, worldwide rights to alitretinoin (Toctino), an eczema drug, for US$302million. In 2013, GSK acquired Human Genome Sciences (HGS) for US$3billion; the companies had collaborated on developing the lupus drug Belimumab (Benlysta), albiglutide for type 2 diabetes, and darapladib for atherosclerosis, and in September, sold its beverage division to Suntory. This included the brands Lucozade and Ribena; however, the deal did not include Horlicks.

In March 2014, GSK paid US$1billion to raise its stake in its Indian pharmaceutical unit, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, to 75 per cent as part of a move to focus on emerging markets. In April 2014, Novartis and Glaxo agreed on more than US$20billion in deals, with Novartis selling its vaccine business to GSK and buying GSK&#x27;s cancer business. In February 2015, GSK announced that it would acquire GlycoVaxyn, a Swiss pharmaceutical company, for US$190million, and in June that year that it would sell two meningitis drugs to Pfizer, Nimenrix and Mencevax for around US$130million.

Philip Hampton, at that time chair of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became GSK chairman in September 2015.

On 31 March 2017, Emma Walmsley became CEO. She is the first female CEO of the company.

In December 2017, Reuters reported that Glaxo had increased its stake in its Saudi Arabian unit to 75% (from 49%) taking over control from its Saudi partner Banaja KSA Holding Company.

With respect to rare diseases, the company divested its portfolio of gene therapy drugs to Orchard Therapeutics in April 2018. In November 2018, Reuters reported that Unilever was in prime position to acquire GSK&#x27;s interest in its Indian unit, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd, in a sale that could generate around US$4billion for the company. Nestlé and Coca-Cola have also been reported to be interested in the business unit as they look to strengthen their presence in India. On 3 December 2018, GSK announced that Unilever would acquire the Indian-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare business for US$3.8billion (£2.98billion). Unilever will pay the majority of the deal in cash, with the remaining being paid in shares in its Indian operation, Hindustan Unilever Limited. Upon completion, GSK will then own around 5.7% of Hindustan Unilever Limited, selling those shares in a number of tranches. The same day, the company also announced it would acquire oncology specialist, Tesaro, for US$5.1billion. The deal will give GSK control of ovarian cancer treatment, Zejula - a member of the class of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

In October 2019, GSK agreed to sell its rabies vaccine, RabAvert, and its tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, Encepur, to Bavarian Nordic for US$1.06billion (€955million).

In July 2020, GSK acquired a 10% stake in German biotech company CureVac.

==== GSK–Novartis consumer healthcare buy-out ====
In March 2018, GSK announced that it has reached an agreement with Novartis to acquire Novartis&#x27;s 36.5% stake in their Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture for US$13billion (£9.2billion).

==== GSK–Pfizer joint venture ====
In December 2018, GSK announced that it, along with Pfizer, had reached an agreement to merge and combine their consumer healthcare divisions into a single entity. The combined entity would have sales of around £9.8billion ($12.7billion), with GSK maintaining a 68% controlling stake in the joint venture. Pfizer would own the remaining 32% shareholding. The deal builds on an earlier 2018 deal where GSK bought out Novartis&#x27; stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business.

==== Subsequent split ====

The culmination of the Consumer Healthcare string of deals will result in GSK splitting into two separate companies, via a demerger and subsequent listing of the joint venture. This will create two publicly traded companies, one focusing on pharmaceuticals and research &amp; development, the other on consumer healthcare. On 22 February 2022, GSK announced that the spin-off consumer healthcare company will be called Haleon.

In January 2022, the company announced that they had received three unsolicited offers from Unilever to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business unit, with the final proposal valuing the business unit at £50 billion (£41.7 billion in cash, plus £8.3 billion in Unilever shares).

Subsequently, GSK declined all outside offers/attempts to acquire its consumer healthcare business and moved forward with its plan to complete the demerger from the main biopharmaceutical business.

=== Recent developments ===
In April 2022, the business announced it would acquire Sierra Oncology Inc for $1.9 billion ($55 per share). In May 2022, GSK announced it would acquire Affinivax and its phase II 24-valent pneumococcal vaccine candidate for up to $3.3 billion, strengthening its vaccine business.

On 16 May 2022, the company changed its name from GlaxoSmithKline to GSK.

In April 2023, GSK announced it would acquire Bellus Health Inc. for $2 billion.

In February 2024, the company acquired Aiolos Bio for over $1 billion, adding to its existing asthma business through AIO-001 a long-acting monoclonal antibody that targets the thymic stromal lymphopoietin cytokine.

In May 2024, GSK sold off its 4.2% shares in Haleon for $1.58 billion.

In July 2024, GSK moved its headquarters from Brentford to New Oxford Street in central London.

==Research areas and products==
===Pharmaceuticals===
GSK manufactures products for major disease areas such as asthma, cancer, infections, diabetes, and mental health. Medicines historically discovered or developed at GSK and its legacy companies and now sold as generics include amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin-clavulanate, mupirocin, and ceftazidime for bacterial infections, zidovudine for HIV infection, valacyclovir for herpes virus infections, albendazole for parasitic infections, sumatriptan for migraine, lamotrigine for epilepsy, bupropion and paroxetine for major depressive disorder, cimetidine and ranitidine for gastroesophageal reflux disorder, mercaptopurine and thioguanine for the treatment of leukemia, allopurinol for gout, pyrimethamine for malaria, and the antibacterial trimethoprim.

Among these, albendazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, allopurinol, mercaptopurine, mupirocin, pyrimethamine, ranitidine, thioguanine, trimethoprim, and zidovudine are on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

===Malaria vaccine===
In 2014, GSK applied for regulatory approval for the first malaria vaccine. Malaria is responsible for over 650,000 deaths annually, mainly in Africa. Known as RTS,S, the vaccine was developed as a joint project with the PATH vaccines initiative and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The company has committed to making the vaccine available in developing countries for five per cent above the cost of production.

, RTS,S, which uses GSK&#x27;s proprietary AS01 adjuvant, was being examined in a Phase 3 trial in eight African countries. PATH reported that &quot;[i]n the 12-month period following vaccination, RTS,S conferred approximately 50% protection from clinical Plasmodium falciparum disease in children aged 5-17 months, and approximately 30% protection in children aged 6-12 weeks when administered in conjunction with Expanded Program for Immunization (EPI) vaccines.&quot; In 2014, Glaxo said it had spent more than US$350million and expected to spend an additional US$260million before seeking regulatory approval.

===Consumer healthcare===
GSK&#x27;s consumer healthcare division, which earned £5.2billion in 2013, sells oral healthcare, including Aquafresh, Macleans and Sensodyne toothpastes. GSK also previously owned the Lucozade and Ribena brands of soft drinks, but they were sold in 2013, to Suntory for £1.35bn. Other products include Abreva to treat cold sores; Night Nurse, a cold remedy; Breathe Right nasal strips; and Nicoderm and Nicorette nicotine replacements. In March 2014, it recalled Alli, an over-the-counter weight-loss drug, in the United States and Puerto Rico because of possible tampering, following customer complaints. On 18 July 2022, GSK formally spun off its consumer healthcare business as a separate entity, Haleon.

===Facilities===
, GSK had offices in over 115 countries and employed over 99,000 people, 12,500 in R&amp;D. The company&#x27;s single largest market is the United States. Its US headquarters are in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Durham, North Carolina; its consumer-products division is in Moon Township, Pennsylvania.

===COVID-19 vaccine===

In July 2020, the UK government signed up for 60 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by GSK and Sanofi. It uses a recombinant protein–based technology from Sanofi and GSK&#x27;s pandemic technology. The companies claimed to be able to produce one billion doses, subject to successful trials and regulatory approval, during the first half of 2021. The company also agreed to a $2.1 billion deal with the United States to produce 100 million doses of the vaccine.

==Venture arms==
SR One was established in 1985, by SmithKline Beecham to invest in new biotechnology companies and continued operating after GSK was formed; by 2003, GSK had formed another subsidiary, GSK Ventures, to out-license or start new companies around drug candidates that it did not intend to develop further. , SR One tended to invest only if the company aligned with GSK&#x27;s business.

In September 2019, Avalon Ventures announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the acquisition of Sitari Pharmaceuticals by GSK. This includes its transglutaminase 2 (TG2) small molecule program for the treatment of celiac disease.

==Recognition, philanthropy and social responsibility==
===Scientific recognition===
Four GlaxoSmithKline scientists have been recognized by the Nobel Committee for their contributions to basic medical science and/or therapeutics development.
* Henry Dale, a former student of Paul Ehrlich, received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on the chemical transmission of neural impulses. Dale served as a pharmacologist and then as Director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories from 1904 to 1914, and later served as Trustee and chairman of the board of the Wellcome Trust.
* John Vane of Wellcome Research Laboratories shared the 1982 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his work on prostaglandin biology and the discovery of prostacyclin. Vane served as group research and development director for The Wellcome Foundation from 1973 to 1985.
* Gertrude B. Elion and George Hitchings, both of the Wellcome Research Laboratories, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Sir James W. Black, formerly of Smith Kline &amp; French and the Wellcome Foundation, &quot;&quot;for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment&quot;.&quot; Elion and Hitchings were responsible for the discovery of a plethora of important drugs, including mercaptopurine and thioguanine for the treatment of leukemia, the immunosuppressant azothioprine, allopurinol for gout, pyrimethamine for malaria, the antibacterial trimethoprim, acyclovir for herpes virus infection, and nelarabine for cancer treatment.

===Philanthropy and social responsibility===
Since 2010, GlaxoSmithKline has several times ranked first among pharmaceutical companies on the Global Access to Medicines Index, which is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2014, the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT-rights advocacy group gave GSK a score of 100 per cent in its Corporate Equality Index.

GSK has been active, with the World Health Organization (WHO), in the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF). Around 120million people globally are believed to be infected with lymphatic filariasis. In 2012, the company endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases; it agreed to donate 400million albendazole tablets to the WHO each year to fight soil-transmitted helminthiasis and to provide 600million albendazole tablets every year for lymphatic filariasis until the disease is eradicated. , over 5billion treatments had been delivered, and 18 of 73 countries in which the disease is considered endemic had progressed to the surveillance stage.

In 2009, the company said it would cut drug prices by 25 per cent in 50 of the poorest nations, release intellectual property rights for substances and processes relevant to neglected disease into a patent pool to encourage new drug development, and invest 20 per cent of profits from the least-developed countries in medical infrastructure for those countries. Médecins Sans Frontières welcomed the decision, but criticized GSK for failing to include HIV patents in its patent pool and for not including middle-income countries in the initiative.

In 2013, GSK licensed its HIV portfolio to the Medicines Patent Pool for use in children, and agreed to negotiate a license for dolutegravir, an integrase inhibitor then in clinical development. In 2014, this license was extended to include dolutegravir and adults with HIV. The licenses include countries in which 93 per cent of adults and 99 per cent of children with HIV live. Also in 2013 GSK joined AllTrials, a British campaign to ensure that all clinical trials are registered and the results reported. The company said it would make its past clinical-trial reports available and future ones within a year of the studies&#x27; end.

GSK has largely had an access strategy, providing medicines at a subsidized price to lower and middle income markets including Africa under the former CEO Andrew Witty. In 2017, its new CEO, Emma Walmsley, shifted away from this with GSK exiting all Sub-Saharan African markets and there being no plans to provide its newer expensive oncology and genetics pipeline to this population.

==Controversies==
===1973 Antitrust case over griseofulvin===
In the 1960s, Glaxo Group Ltd. (Glaxo) and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) each owned patents covering various aspects of the antifungal drug griseofulvin. They created a patent pool by cross-licensing their patents, subject to express licensing restrictions that the chemical from which the &quot;finished&quot; form of the drug (tablets and capsules) was made must not be resold in bulk form, and they licensed other drug companies to sell the drug in finished form and subject to similar restrictions. The effect and intent of the bulk-sale restriction was to keep the drug chemical out of the hands of small companies that might act as price-cutters, and the effect was to maintain stable, uniform prices.

The United States brought an antitrust suit against the two companies—&quot;United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.&quot;—charging them with violation of the Sherman Act and also seeking to have the patents declared invalid. The trial court found that the defendants had engaged in several unlawful conspiracies, but dismissed the part of the suit seeking invalidation of patents and refused to grant as relief mandatory sales of the bulk drug chemical and compulsory licensing of the patents. The government appealed to the Supreme Court, which reversed, in &quot;United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.&quot;, 410 U.S. 52 (1973).

===2000s Ribena===

There were concerns in the 2000s about the sugar and vitamin content of Ribena, a blackcurrant-based syrup and soft drink owned by GSK until 2013. Produced in England by H.W. Carter &amp; Co from the 1930s, the company&#x27;s unbranded syrup was distributed to children as a source of vitamin C during World War II, which gave the drink a reputation as good for health. Beecham bought H. W. Carter in 1955.

In 2001, the British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) required GSK to withdraw its claim that Ribena Toothkind, a lower-sugar variety, did not encourage tooth decay. A company poster showed bottles of Toothkind in place of the bristles on a toothbrush. The ASA&#x27;s ruling was upheld by the High Court. In 2007, GSK was fined US$217,000 in New Zealand over its claim that ready-to-drink Ribena contained high levels of vitamin C, after two schoolgirls showed it contained no detectable vitamin C. In 2013, GSK sold Ribena and another drink, Lucozade, to the Japanese multinational Suntory for £1.35billion.

===SB Pharmco Puerto Rico===
In 2010, the US Department of Justice announced that GSK would pay a US$150million criminal fine and forfeiture, and a civil settlement of US$600million under the False Claims Act. The fines stemmed from production of improperly made and adulterated drugs from 2001 to 2005, at GSK&#x27;s subsidiary, SB Pharmco Puerto Rico Inc., in Cidra, Puerto Rico, which at the time produced US$5.5 billion of products each year. The drugs involved were Kytril, an antiemetic; Bactroban, used to treat skin infections; Paxil, the anti-depressant; and Avandamet, a diabetes drug. GSK closed the factory in 2009.

The case began in 2002, when GSK sent experts to fix problems cited by the FDA. The lead inspector recommended recalls of defective products, but they were not authorised; she was fired in 2003, and filed a whistleblower lawsuit. In 2005, federal marshals seized US$2billion worth of products, the largest such seizure in history. In the 2010 settlement SB Pharmco pleaded guilty to criminal charges, and agreed to pay US$150 million in a criminal fine and forfeiture, at that time the largest such payment ever by a manufacturer of adulterated drugs, and US$600 million in civil penalties to settle the civil lawsuit.

=== 2010 Pandemrix connected with narcolepsy ===
The Pandemrix influenza vaccine was developed by GlaxoSmithKline in 2006. It was used by Finland and Sweden in the H1N1 mass vaccination of the population against the 2009 swine flu pandemic. In August 2010, The Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) and The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) launched investigations regarding the development of narcolepsy as a possible side effect to Pandemrix flu vaccination in children, and found a 6.6-fold increased risk among children and youths, resulting in 3.6 additional cases of narcolepsy per 100,000 vaccinated subjects.

In February 2011, The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) concluded that there is a clear connection between the Pandemrix vaccination campaign of 2009 and 2010, and the narcolepsy epidemic in Finland. A total of 152 cases of narcolepsy were found in Finland during 2009–2010, and ninety per cent of them had received the Pandemrix vaccination. Sweden however observed very few influenza cases totally in 2009 and especially 2010 as compared to most other years. In 2015, it was reported that the British Department of Health was paying for Sodium oxybate medication for 80 patients who are taking legal action over problems linked to the use of the swine flu vaccine, at a cost to the government of £12,000 per patient per year.

===2012 criminal and civil settlement===
====Overview====
In July 2012, GSK pleaded guilty in the United States to criminal charges, and agreed to pay US$3billion, in what was the largest settlement until then between the Justice Department and a drug company. The US$3billion included a criminal fine of US$956,814,400 and forfeiture of US$43,185,600. The remaining US$2billion covered a civil settlement with the government under the False Claims Act. The investigation was launched largely on the basis of information from four whistleblowers who filed qui tam (whistleblower) lawsuits against the company under the False Claims Act.

The charges stemmed from GSK&#x27;s promotion of the anti-depressants Paxil (paroxetine) and Wellbutrin (bupropion) for unapproved uses from 1998 to 2003, specifically as suitable for patients under the age of 18, and from its failure to report safety data about Avandia (rosiglitazone), both in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Other drugs promoted for unapproved uses were two inhalers, Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol) and Flovent (fluticasone propionate), as well as Zofran (ondansetron), Imitrex (sumatriptan), Lotronex (alosetron) and Valtrex (valaciclovir).

The settlement also covered reporting false best prices and underpaying rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and kickbacks to physicians to prescribe GSK&#x27;s drugs. There were all-expenses-paid spa treatments and hunting trips for doctors and their spouses, speakers&#x27; fees at conferences, and payment for articles ghostwritten by the company and placed by physicians in medical journals. The company set up a ghostwriting programme called CASPPER, initially to produce articles about Paxil but which was extended to cover Avandia.

As part of the settlement GSK signed a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services, which obliged the company to make major changes in the way it did business, including changing its compensation programmes for its sales force and executives, and to implement and maintain transparency in its research practices and publication policies. It announced in 2013, that it would no longer pay doctors to promote its drugs or attend medical conferences, and that its sales staff would no longer have prescription targets.

====Rosiglitazone (Avandia)====
The 2012 settlement included a criminal fine of US$242,612,800 for failing to report safety data to the FDA about Avandia (rosiglitazone), a diabetes drug approved in 1999, and a civil settlement of US$657million for making false claims about it. The Justice Department said GSK had promoted rosiglitazone to physicians with misleading information, including that it conferred cardiovascular benefits despite an FDA-mandated label warning of cardiovascular risks.

In 1999, John Buse, a diabetes specialist, told medical conferences that rosiglitazone might carry an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. GSK threatened to sue him, called his university head of department, and persuaded him to sign a retraction. GSK raised questions internally about the drug&#x27;s safety in 2000, and in 2002, the company ghostwrote an article in &quot;Circulation&quot; describing a GSK funded clinical trial that suggested rosiglitazone might have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk. From 2001, reports began to link the thiazolidinediones (the class of drugs to which rosiglitazone belongs) to heart failure. In April that year, GSK began a six-year, open-label, randomized trial, known as RECORD, to examine rosiglitazone and cardiovascular events. Two GSK meta-analyses in 2005, and 2006, showed an increased risk of cardiovascular problems with rosiglitazone; the information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. By December 2006, rosiglitazone had become the top-selling diabetes drug, with annual sales of US$3.3billion.

In June 2007, &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; published a meta-analysis that associated the drug with an increased risk of heart attack. GSK had reportedly tried to persuade one of the authors, Steven Nissen, not to publish it, after receiving an advance copy from one of the journal&#x27;s peer reviewers, a GSK consultant. In July 2007, FDA scientists suggested that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a boxed warning, but did not withdraw it. (In 2013, the FDA rejected that the drug had caused excess heart attacks.) A Senate Finance Committee inquiry concluded in 2010, that GSK had sought to intimidate scientists who had concerns about rosiglitazone. In February that year the company tried to halt publication of an editorial about the controversy by Nissen in the &quot;European Heart Journal&quot;.

The results of GSK&#x27;s RECORD trial were published in June 2009. It confirmed an association between rosiglitazone and an increased risk of heart failure and fractures, but not of heart attack, and concluded that it &quot;does not increase the risk of overall cardiovascular morbidity or mortality compared with standard glucose-lowering drugs.&quot; Steven Nissan and Kathy Wolkski argued that the study&#x27;s low event rates reduced its statistical power. In September 2009, rosiglitazone was suspended in Europe. The results of the RECORD study were confirmed in 2013, by the Duke Clinical Research Institute, in an independent review required by the FDA. In November that year the FDA lifted the restrictions it had placed on the drug. The boxed warning about heart attack was removed; the warning about heart failure remained in place.

====Paroxetine (Paxil/Seroxat)====
GSK was fined for promoting Paxil/Seroxat (paroxetine) for treating depression in the under-18s, although the drug had not been approved for pediatric use.
Paxil had US$4.97billion worldwide sales in 2003. The company conducted nine clinical trials between 1994, and 2002, none of which showed that Paxil helped children with depression. From 1998, to 2003, it promoted the drug for the under-18s, paying physicians to go on all-expenses paid trips, five-star hotels and spas. From 2004, Paxil&#x27;s label, along with those of similar drugs, included an FDA-mandated boxed warning that it might increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients under 18.

An internal SmithKline Beecham document said in 1998, about withheld data from two GSK studies: &quot;It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that [pediatric] efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine.&quot; The company ghostwrote an article, published in 2001, in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&quot;, that misreported the results of one of its clinical trials, Study 329. The article concluded that Paxil was &quot;generally well tolerated and effective for major depression in adolescents.&quot; The suppression of the research findings is the subject of the 2008 book &quot;Side Effects&quot; by Alison Bass.

For 10 years GSK marketed Paxil as non-habit forming. In 2001, 35 patients filed a class-action suit alleging they had had withdrawal symptoms, and in 2002, a Los Angeles court issued an injunction preventing GSK from advertising that the drug was not habit forming. The court withdrew the injunction after the FDA objected that the court had no jurisdiction over drug marketing that the FDA had approved. In 2003, a World Health Organization committee reported that Paxil was among the top 30 drugs, and top three antidepressants, for which dependence had been reported.

====Bupropion (Wellbutrin)====
The company was also fined for promoting Wellbutrin (bupropion) – approved at the time for major depressive disorder and also sold as a smoking-cessation aid, Zyban – for weight loss and the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sexual dysfunction and substance addiction. GSK paid doctors to promote these off-label uses, and set up supposedly independent advisory boards and Continuing Medical Education programmes.

===Bribery in China===

In 2013, Chinese authorities announced that, since 2007, GSK had funnelled HK$3.8billion in kickbacks to GSK managers, doctors, hospitals and others who prescribed their drugs, using over 700 travel agencies and consulting firms. Chinese authorities arrested four GSK executives as part of a four-month investigation into claims that doctors were bribed with cash and sexual favours. In 2014, a Chinese court found the company guilty of bribery and imposed a fine of US$490million. Mark Reilly, the British head of GSK&#x27;s Chinese operations, received a three-year suspended prison sentence after a one-day trial held in secret. Reilly was reportedly deported from China and dismissed by the company.

===Market manipulation in the UK===
In February 2016, the company was fined over £37million in the UK by the Competition and Markets Authority for paying Generics UK, Alpharma and Norton Healthcare more than £50m between 2001, and 2004, to keep generic varieties of paroxetine out of the UK market. The generics companies were fined a further £8million. At the end of 2003, when generics became available in the UK, the price of paroxetine dropped by 70 per cent.

===Miscellaneous===
Italian police sought bribery charges in May 2004, against 4,400 doctors and 273 GSK employees. GSK and its predecessor were accused of having spent £152m on physicians, pharmacists and others, giving them cameras, computers, holidays and cash. Doctors were alleged to have received cash based on the number of patients they treated with a cancer drug, topotecan (Hycamtin). The following month prosecutors in Munich accused 70–100 doctors of having accepted bribes from SmithKline Beecham between 1997 and 1999. The inquiry was opened over allegations that the company had given over 4,000 hospital doctors money and free trips. All charges were dismissed by the Verona court in January 2009.

In 2006, in the United States GSK settled the largest tax dispute in IRS history, agreeing to pay US$3.1 billion. At issue were Zantac and other products sold in 1989 to 2005. The case revolved around intracompany transfer pricing—determining the share of profit attributable to the US subsidiaries of GSK and subject to tax by the IRS.

The UK&#x27;s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) opened a criminal inquiry in 2014 into GSK&#x27;s sales practices, using powers granted by the Bribery Act 2010. The SFO said it was collaborating with Chinese authorities to investigate bringing charges in the UK related to GSK&#x27;s activities in China, Europe and the Middle East. Also , the US Department of Justice was investigating GSK with reference to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

In October 2020, GSK told some staff that while at work they should disable the contact tracing function of the NHS test-and-trace app which monitors the spread of COVID-19. GSK explained the reason for this was due to social distancing measures in place at their sites rendering the technology unnecessary.

In November 2023, GSK filed a lawsuit against Moderna Inc. in U.S. federal court in Delaware, accusing the company of violating GSK&#x27;s patents related to messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. The lawsuit claims that Moderna&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine Spikevax and RSV vaccine mResvia infringe on several of GSK&#x27;s patents, particularly those related to lipid nanoparticles used for delivering mRNA into the human body. This legal action follows a similar lawsuit GSK filed against Pfizer and BioNTech earlier in 2024, also over patent infringement concerning their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. The current litigation seeks unspecified monetary damages from Moderna.

=== Operation in Russia ===
Following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was criticized for continuing its operations in Russia, despite the ongoing conflict and international sanctions. Although GSK suspended clinical trials, advertising, and promotion in Russia, the company has maintained its supply of essential medicines, vaccines, and medical equipment, with proceeds reportedly directed towards humanitarian aid. Critics argue that GSK&#x27;s decision to continue exporting products—resulting in increased sales and profit volumes in 2022 compared to 2021—undermines the intended impact of sanctions, raising ethical concerns.

<text>Tawhid () is the concept of monotheism in Islam.

Tawhid is the religion&#x27;s central and single most important concept upon which a Muslim&#x27;s entire religious adherence rests. It unequivocally holds that God is indivisibly one (&quot;ahad&quot;) and single (&quot;wahid&quot;).

Tawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of submission. The first part of the Islamic declaration of faith (&quot;shahada&quot;) is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God. To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is considered &quot;shirk&quot;, which is an unpardonable sin unless repented afterwards, according to the Qur&#x27;an. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of &quot;tawhid&quot;.

From an Islamic standpoint, there is an uncompromising nondualism at the heart of the Islamic beliefs (&quot;aqida&quot;) that is seen as distinguishing Islam from other major religions. 

The Quran teaches the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world, a unique, independent and indivisible being that is independent of all of creation. God, according to Islam, is a universal God, rather than a local, tribal or parochial one and is an absolute that integrates all affirmative values.

Islamic intellectual history can be understood as a gradual unfolding of the manner in which successive generations of believers have understood the meaning and implications of professing &quot;tawhid&quot;. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it. Islamic scholastic theology, jurisprudence, philosophy, Sufism, and even the Islamic understanding of natural sciences to some degree, all seek to explain at some level the principle of &quot;tawhid&quot;.

The classical definition of &quot;tawhid&quot; was limited to declaring or preferring belief in one God and the unity of God. Although the monotheistic definition has persisted into modern Arabic, it is now more generally used to connote &quot;unification, union, combination, fusion; standardization, regularization; consolidation, amalgamation, merger&quot;.

Chapter 112 of the Qur&#x27;an, titled al-Ikhlas, reads:
== Etymology ==
The word &quot;&#x27;tawhid&#x27;&quot; (), which means &quot;He asserted, or declared, God to be one&quot;, is derived from the Arabic root &quot;&#x27;wahhada&quot;&#x27; (), which means &quot;to unite&quot; or &quot;to make one&quot;. This term signifies the belief in absolute oneness and uniqueness of God.url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207175323/https://www.bismikaallahuma.org/islam/tawhid-in-islam/ | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name of God in Islam ==

In order to explain the complexity of the unity of God and of the divine nature, the Qur&#x27;an uses 99 terms, which are referred to as &quot;Excellent Names of God&quot; (). The divine names project divine attributes, which in turn project all the levels of the creation down to the physical plane. Aside from the supreme name &quot;Allah&quot; and the neologism &quot;ar-Rahman&quot; (referring to the divine beneficence that creates and maintains the universe) and a few other specific names like &quot;Malik al-Muluk&quot; (&quot;King of Kings&quot;) in an authentic narration of Muhammad, other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God&#x27;s immanence, rather than being a sign of one&#x27;s divinity or, alternatively, imposing a limitation on God&#x27;s transcendent nature. Attribution of divinity to a created entity, &quot;shirk&quot;, is considered a denial of the truth of God and thus is a major sin.

== &quot;Shirk&quot; ==

Associating partners in divinity of God is known as &quot;shirk&quot; and is the antithesis of &quot;tawhid&quot;. Although the term is usually translated as &quot;polytheism&quot; into English, it is thought to be more complex. Alternatively, the translation &#x27;associating [with God]&#x27; has been suggested. The term includes denial of attributing any form of divinity to any other thing but God, which includes the self by elevating oneself above others and associating attributes of God with a created being. That has caused Sunni scholars to accuse Salafis and Wahhabis of depicting God as a created object ruling from the sky.

&quot;Shirk&quot; is classified into two categories:
*&quot;al-Shirk al-akbar&quot; (; ): open and apparent
*&quot;al-shirk al-khafi&quot;; ): concealed or hidden. It is when people perform the necessary rituals but not for God but for the sake of others, including social recognition. &quot;Hidden shirk&quot; might be unwitting, yet punishable, although to a lesser extent than greater forms of shirk.

Chapter 4, verse 48, of the Qur&#x27;an reads:
Chapter 4, verse 116, of the Qur&#x27;an reads:

== Discerning unity of God ==
According to Hossein Nasr, Ali, the first imam (Shia view) and fourth Rashid Caliph (Sunni view), is credited with having established Islamic theology. His quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the Unity of God.

Ali states that &quot;God is One&quot; means that God is away from likeness and numeration, and he is not divisible even in imagination.
Vincent J. Cornell, a scholar of Islamic studies quotes the following statement from Ali:

The perception of &quot;tawhid&quot; laid the foundation of Muslim ethics. According to Islam, the world is sustained by God as the ultimate reality, unique in his attributes, distinct from everything else. &quot;Tawhid&quot; denies any affinity between the creator and its creation. That includes that invisible entities (&quot;jinn&quot;) do not partake in creation but are created, rejection of an avatar or offspring of God, or a partner in creation in form of a sibling or wife. The uniqueness of the creator is expressed in the Daily Prayer&#x27;s (&quot;ṣalāh&quot;) phrase &quot;Allāhu ʾakbar&quot; (&quot;Takbīr&quot;).

== Arguments for oneness of God ==
===Theological===
Theologians usually use reason and deduction to prove the existence, unity and oneness of God. They use a teleological argument for the existence of God as a creator based on perceived evidence of order, purpose, design or direction or some combination of them in nature. Teleology is the supposition that there is a purpose or directive principle in the works and processes of nature.

Another argument that is used frequently by theologians is reductio ad absurdum, which they use instead of positive arguments as a more efficient way to reject their opponent&#x27;s ideas.

===God as cause of causes===

Against the polytheism of pre-Islamic Arabia, the Qur&#x27;an argues that the knowledge of God as the creator of everything rules out the possibility of lesser gods since these beings must be themselves created. For the Qur&#x27;an, God is an immanent and transcendent deity who actively creates, maintains and destroys the universe. The reality of God as the ultimate cause of things is the belief that God is veiled from human understanding because of the secondary causes and contingent realities of things in the world. Thus, the belief in the oneness of God is equated in the Qur&#x27;an with the &quot;belief in the unseen&quot; (). The Qur&#x27;an summarises its task in making the &quot;unseen&quot; become, to a greater or lesser degree, &quot;seen&quot; so that belief in the existence of God becomes a master truth, rather than an unreasonable belief. The Qur&#x27;an states that God&#x27;s signals are so near and yet so far, demanding that its students listen to what it has to say with humility (, ). The Qur&#x27;an draws attention to certain observable facts to present them as &quot;reminders&quot; of God, instead of providing lengthy &quot;theological&quot; proofs for the existence and unity of God.

Ash&#x27;ari theologians rejected cause and effect in essence but accepted it as something that facilitates humankind&#x27;s investigation and comprehension of natural processes. The medieval scholars argued that nature was composed of uniform atoms that were &quot;recreated&quot; at every instant by God. The laws of nature were only the customary sequence of apparent causes (customs of God), the ultimate cause of each accident being God himself. Other forms of the argument also appear in Avicenna&#x27;s other works, and the argument became known as the Proof of the Truthful.

Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being in which he distinguished between essence (&quot;Mahiat&quot;) and existence (&quot;Wujud&quot;). He argued that the fact of existence may not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be caused by an agent-cause that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence.

===God as necessary existent===
An ontological argument for the existence of God was first proposed by Avicenna (965–1037) in the &quot;Metaphysics&quot; section of &quot;The Book of Healing.&quot; Other forms of the argument also appear in Avicenna&#x27;s other works, and the argument became known as the Proof of the Truthful. Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (&quot;Mahiat&quot;) and existence (&quot;Wujud&quot;). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be caused by an agent-cause that necessitates, imparts, gives or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and co-exist with its effect.

That was the first attempt at using the method of a priori proof, which uses intuition and reason alone. Avicenna&#x27;s proof of God&#x27;s existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a cosmological argument and an ontological argument. &quot;It is ontological insofar as &#x27;necessary existence&#x27; in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a Necessary Existent&quot;. The proof is also &quot;cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that contingent existence cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent&quot;. Another argument Avicenna presented for God&#x27;s existence was the problem of the mind–body dichotomy.

According to Avicenna, the universe consists of a chain of actual beings, each giving existence to the one below it and responsible for the existence of the rest of the chain below. Because an actual infinite is deemed impossible by Avicenna, the chain as a whole must terminate in a being that is wholly simple and one, whose essence is its very existence and therefore is self-sufficient and does not need something else to give it existence. Because its existence is not contingent on or necessitated by something else but is necessary and eternal in itself, it satisfies the condition of being the necessitating cause of the entire chain that constitutes the eternal world of contingent existing things. Thus, his ontological system rests on the conception of God as the &quot;Wajib al-Wujud&quot; (necessary existent). There is a gradual multiplication of beings through a timeless emanation from God as a result of his self-knowledge.

===Indivisibility of God&#x27;s sovereignty===
The Qur&#x27;an argues that there can be no multiple sources of divine sovereignty since &quot;behold, each god would have taken away what [each] had created, And some would have Lorded it over others!&quot; The Qur&#x27;an argues that the stability and order prevailing throughout the universe shows that it was created and is being administered by only one God ().

The Qur&#x27;an in verse 21:22 states, &quot;Had there been within them [i.e., the heavens and earth] gods besides Allāh, they both would have been ruined&quot;. Later Muslim theologians elaborated on the verse by saying that the existence of at least two gods would inevitably arise between them, at one time or another, a conflict of wills. Since two contrary wills could not possibly be realized at the same time, one of them must admit himself powerless in that particular instance. On the other hand, a powerless being can not by definition be a god. Therefore, the possibility of having more than one god is ruled out. For if a god is powerful above another, that asserts a difference in the particular attributes that are confined to the essence of godhood, which implies the lesser god must lack in certain necessary attributes, whic make the deity as anthropomorphic and snatches the title of god away from that entity.

===Other arguments===
The Qur&#x27;an argues that human beings have an instinctive distaste for polytheism. At times of crisis, for example, even the idolaters forget the false deities and call upon the one true God for help. As soon as they are relieved from the danger, however, they start associating other beings with God. &quot;If they happen to be aboard a ship &#x27;caught in a storm&#x27;, they cry out to Allah ˹alone˺ in sincere devotion. But as soon as He delivers them &#x27;safely&#x27; to shore, they associate &#x27;others with Him once again&#x27;.&quot; ().

Next, the Qur&#x27;an argues that polytheism takes away from human dignity. God has honoured human beings and given them charge of the physical world, yet they disgrace their position in the world by worshipping what they carve out with their own hands.

Lastly, the Qur&#x27;an argues that monotheism is not a later discovery made by the human race but rather that there is the combined evidence of the prophetic call for monotheism throughout human history that started from Adam. The Qur&#x27;an suggests several causes for deviation from monotheism to polytheism since a geat temporal power, which is regarded by the holder and his subjects as &#x27;absolute&#x27;, may lead the holder to think that he is God-like. Such claims were commonly forced upon and accepted by those who were subject to the ruler. Also, certain natural phenomena (such as the sun, the moon and the stars) inspire feelings of awe, wonder or admiration that could lead some to regard these celestial bodies as deities. Another reason for deviatiing from monotheism is one becoming a slave to one&#x27;s base desires and passions. In seeking to always satisfy the desires, one may commit a kind of polytheism.

== Interpretations ==

Understanding of the meaning of &quot;tawhid&quot; is one of the most controversial issues for Muslims. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it, comprising textualistic approach, theological approach, philosophical approach, and the Sufi and Irfani approach. These different approaches lead to different and in some cases opposite understanding of the issue.

===Theological viewpoints===
Certain theologians use the term &quot;tawhid&quot; in a much broader meaning to denote the totality of discussion of God, his existence and his various attributes. Others go yet further and use the term to ultimately represent the totality of the &quot;principles of religion&quot;. In its current usage, the expressions &quot;tawhid&quot; or &quot;knowledge of tawhid&quot; are sometimes used as equivalents for the whole Kalam, Islamic theology.

According to Sunni Islam, the orthodox understanding of theology is taken directly from the teachings of Muhammad with the understanding and methodology of his companions, sourced directly from the revealed scripture the Qur&#x27;an; being the main information source for understanding the unification of God in Islam. All Muslim authorities maintain that a true understanding of God is impossible unless he introduces himself because the fact that God is beyond the range of human vision and senses. Therefore, God tells people who he is by speaking through the prophets. According to that view, the fundamental message of all of the prophets is: &quot;There is no god worthy of worship except Allah (avoiding the false gods as stated in Surah hud)&quot;.

==== Atharism and Hanbalites ====

The approach of textual interpretation in Islam is to avoid delving into theological speculation and did not employ the use of &quot;kalam&quot;.

&#x27;Abdullah al-Ansari al-Herawi was a Hanbalite scholar who sought to reform sufistic interpretations in accordance with the salaf (al-salaf al-saleh). According to al-Herawi, tawhid consists of transcending Allah from contingent being. Al-Herawi distinguishes between three stage of tawhid: the first is for the common people, the second is for the privileged ones, and the third, for the privileged from among the privileged.

====Mu&#x27;tazili school ====

The Mu&#x27;tazilis liked to call themselves the &quot;people of the tawhid&quot; (ahl al-tawhid). In Maqalat al-Islamiyin, Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari describes the Mu&#x27;tazilite conception of the tawhid as follows:
God is unique, nothing is like him; he is neither body, nor individual, nor substance, nor accident. He is beyond time. He cannot dwell in a place or within a being; he is not the object of any creatural attribute or qualification. He is neither conditioned nor determined, neither engendered nor engendering. He is beyond the perception of the senses. The eyes cannot see him, observation cannot attain him, the imagination cannot comprehend him. He is a thing, but he is not like other things; he is omniscient, all-powerful, but his omniscience and his all-mightiness cannot be compared to anything created. He created the world without any pre-established archetype and without an auxiliary.

According to Henry Corbin, the result of that interpretation is the negation of the divine attributes, the affirmation of the created Quran and the denial of all possibility of the vision of God in the world beyond. Mu&#x27;tazilis believed that God is deprived of all positive attributes, in the sense that all divine qualifications must be understood as being the essence itself, and declared that God is existing ubiquitously and in everything. They resorted to metaphorical interpretations of Qur&#x27;anic verses or Prophetic reports with seemingly anthropomorphic content. For example, the hand is the metaphorical designation of power; the face signifies the essence and the fact that God is seated on the Throne is a metaphorical image of the divine reign.

====Ash&#x27;ari school====

The solution proposed by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari to solve the problems of tashbih and ta&#x27;til concedes that the divine Being possesses in a real sense the Attributes and Names mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an. Insofar as those names and attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they do not have either existence or reality apart from it. The inspiration of al-Ash&#x27;ari in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level, which Mu&#x27;tazilis thinking had failed to grasp.

Ash&#x27;ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the 10th to the 19th centuries, insists on the ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash&#x27;arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, and on such questions as God&#x27;s creation of evil and the apparent anthropomorphism of God&#x27;s attributes, revelation must be accepted &quot;bila kayfa&quot; (without [asking] how).

====Twelver theology====

Twelver theology is based on the Hadith which have been narrated from the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the first, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth Imams and compiled by Shia scholars such as Al-Shaykh al-Saduq in &quot;al-Tawhid&quot;.
According to Shia theologians, the attributes and names of God have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God. Any suggestion of the attributes and names being conceived of as separate is thought to entail polytheism. It would be incorrect to say even that God knows by his knowledge, which is in his essence, but God knows by his knowledge, which is his essence. Also, God has no physical form, and he is imperceptible.

Twelvers believe God is alone in being, along with his names, his attributes, his actions and his theophanies. The totality of being therefore is he, passes through him, comes from him and returns to him. God is not a being next to or above other beings, his creatures. He is being, the absolute act of being (wujud mutlaq). If there were being other than he (i.e., creatural being), God would no longer be the Unique: the only one to be. As this Divine Essence is infinite, his qualities are the same as his essence, Essentially there is one Reality which is one and indivisible. The border between theoretical tawhid and shirk is to know that every reality and being in its essence, attributes and action are from him (from Him-ness), it is tawhid. Every supernatural action of the prophets is by God&#x27;s permission as Quran points to it. The border between the tawhid and shirk in practice is to assume something as an end in itself, independent from God, not as a road to God (to Him-ness).

====Salafism and Wahhabism ====
Later Hanbalites, such as the proto-Salafi ibn Taimiyya ignore the works of their predecessors. Instead, they formulated a new normative theory on tawhid.

Additional to the first meaning of &quot;tawhid&quot; (&quot;Rubūbīyah&quot; (Lordship)), on which all Sunnis agree, Salafism holds two additional meanings: &quot;Al-Asma wa&#x27;s-Sifat&quot; (names and attributes) and &quot;Al-&#x27;Ibadah&quot; (worship). &quot;Al-Asma wa&#x27;s-Sifat&quot; includes lordship in the form of a legislator. Salafis consider that as legislation that is not based on (their own) interpretation of &quot;sharia&quot; to be a form of polytheism. &quot;Al-&#x27;Ibadah&quot; is furthermore understood to mean that everyday acts must be in accordance with &quot;sharia&quot;. Doing something else would imply accepting an authority or object of desire other than God.

The Salafi specific features of &quot;tawhid&quot; tend to elide the sovereignty and uniqueness of God. For this reason, other Sunnis disagree with these two features, as they regard it as comparing God to a created object ascribed some power to.

===Philosophical viewpoints===

Al-Farabi, Al-Razi and especially Avicenna put forward an interpretation of Tawhid in light of reason, with the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith serving as a basis. Before Avicenna, discussions among Muslim philosophers had been about the unity of God as divine creator and his relationship with the world as creation. The earlier philosophers were profoundly affected by the emphasis of Plotinus on divine simplicity.

===Sufi and Irfani viewpoint===

In Islamic mysticism (Sufism and Irfan), Tawhid is he affirmation in speech of God&#x27;s unity but also and just as importantly a practical and existential realization of that unity. That is done by rejecting the concepts tied to the world of multiplicity, to isolate the eternal from the temporal in a practical way. The ideal is a radical purification from all worldliness. According to Vincent J. Cornall, it is possible to draw up a monist image of God (&quot;see Sufi metaphysics&quot;) by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things: &quot;He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent: and He has full knowledge of all things.&quot;()&quot; However many Muslims criticize monism for it blurs the distinction between the creator and the creature, something incompatible with the genuine and absolute monotheism of Islam.

For Muslim mystics (sufis), the affirmation in speech of God&#x27;s unity is only the first step of tawhid. Further steps involve a spiritual experience for the existential realization of that unity. Categorizations of different steps of tawhid may be found in the works of Muslims Sufis like Junayd Baghdadi and al-Ghazali. It involves a practical rejection of the concepts tied to the world of multiplicity. Al-Junayd for example &quot;distinguishes four steps, starting from the simple attestation of unicity which is sufficient for ordinary believers, and culminating in the highest rank reserved for the elite, when the creature totally ceases to exist before his Lord, thus achieving al-fanā fi al-tawhīd [annihilation in unity]&quot;.

====Annihilation and subsistence====
According to the concept of Fana, Annihilation and Subsistence, &quot;Man&#x27;s existence, or ego, or self-hood... must be annihilated so that he can attain to his true self which is his existence and &quot;subsistence&quot; with God. All of man&#x27;s character traits and habits, everything that pertains to his individual existence must become completely naughted and &quot;obliterated&quot; (mahw). Then God will give back to him his character traits and everything positive he ever possessed. But at this stage, he will know consciously and actually—not just theoretically—and with a through spiritual realization, that everything he is derives absolutely from God. He is nothing but a ray of God&#x27;s Attributes manifesting the Hidden Treasure&quot;.

Shah Nimatullah Wali describes the necessity to turn away from everything subject to change in order to come close to God and turn away from idolatry:
&quot;So turn away from everything and find thus what you seek. Once you&#x27;ve abandoned everything He&#x27;ll then reveal a cheek.&quot;
Simulteneously, the author warns the audience not to confuse poverty with &quot;lacking possession&quot; (turning away from everything subject to change):
&quot;The meaning of &#x27;non-existence of ownership&#x27; is that the poor man has nothing that can be attributed to himself as a possession, to the extent that he becomes annihiliated from himself, such that, &#x27;The poor man does not need anything and nothing needs him.&#x27; This is the station of pure unity and absolute oneness, notwithstanding the fact that unity becomes confirmed each time an excess is shed, for &#x27;Unity is the shedding of excesses.&#x27; This is the reason why it has been said, &#x27;When poverty is perfected there is only God left.&#x27;&quot;

====Unity of existence====

The first detailed formulation of &quot;Unity of Existence&quot; (&quot;wahdat al-wujud&quot;) is closely associated to Ibn Arabi. Widely different interpretations of the meaning of the &quot;Unity of Existence&quot; have been proposed throughout the centuries by critics, defenders, and Western scholars. Ibn Arabi himself did not use the term &quot;Unity of Existence&quot; and similar statements had been made by those before him. For example, according to al-Ghazali &quot;There is nothing in wujud [existence] except God...Wujud [Existence] only belongs to the Real One&quot;. Ghazali explains that the fruit of spiritual ascent of the Sufi is to &quot;witness that there is no existence in the world save God and that &#x27;All things are perishing except his face&#x27; (Qur&#x27;an 28:88)&quot;

Many authors consider being or existence to be the proper designation for the reality of God. While all Muslims believe the reality of God to be one, critics hold that the term &quot;existence&quot; (wujud) is also used for the existence of things in this world and that the doctrine blurs the distinction between the existence of the creator and that of the creation. Defenders argued that Ibn Arabi and his followers are offering a &quot;subtle metaphysics following the line of the Asharite formula: &quot;The attributes are neither God nor other than God.&quot; God&#x27;s &quot;signs&quot; (ayat) and &quot;traces&quot; (athar)—the creatures—are neither the same as God nor different from him, because God must be understood as both absent and present, both transcendent and immanent. Understood correctly, wahdat al-wujud elucidates the delicate balance that needs to be maintained between these two perspectives.&quot; Shah Wali Allah of Delhi argued that the Ibn Arabi&#x27;s &quot;unity of being&quot; was experiential and based on a subjective experience of illumination or ecstasy, rather than an ontological reality.

Uttering &quot;I&quot; or considering oneself as in power separate from God are forms of idolatry for many Sufis. In the metaphysical cosmology of Sufism, God&#x27;s sovereignty is a necessity, not an accident. Therefore, it is impossible to worship something else but God. By venerating the self, one worships God in the name of &quot;Jalal&quot; (majesty). This name is supposed to be worshipped and then transmitted by Iblis (Satan). Since it is impossible for two majesties to co-exist, one cannot participate in divine intimacy or mercy and will also be subject to God&#x27;s wrath.

== Influences on Muslim culture ==
The Islamic doctrine of Tawhid puts forth a God whose rule, will or law are comprehensive and extend to all creatures and to all aspects of the human life. Early Muslims thus understood religion to cover the domains of the state, law and society. It is believed that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid. Muslims use the single raised index finger gesture (&quot;al-sabbaba&quot; or &quot;al-sabbaha&quot;) as a symbol of &quot;tawhid&quot;. In the following, we provide a few examples of the influences of Tawhid on the Muslim culture:

===Interpersonal relationship===
According to the Qur&#x27;an, one consequence of properly conceived relationship between God and man as the served and servant is the proper relationship among humans. To achieve the former, the Qur&#x27;an consistently &quot;reminds&quot; mankind of two points. God is one; everything except God (including the entirety of nature) is contingent upon God. With all His might and glory, God is essentially the all-merciful God.

===Good and evil===
According to the Qur&#x27;an, God is the progenitor of all things, both good and evil. As is written in the Qur&#x27;an, all of humanity is created at the will of Allah, both the good and the evil, and their natures have been predisposed as such since the beginning of creation.

According to the Qur&#x27;an, Satan deviated from the unification of God in the story of creation of man by permitting his own hierarchical value system to supersede God&#x27;s will: God asked the angels to bow to Adam, who he had created from clay. Satan refused and said, &quot;I am better than him; you created me from fire and created him from clay&quot;. The medieval Muslim scholar Al-Ghazali, pointing out that the only legitimate &quot;preference principle&quot; in the sight of God is piety, wrote, &quot;Every time a rich man believes that he is better than a poor one, or a white man believes that he is better than a black one, then he is being arrogant. He is adopting the same hierarchical principles adopted by Iblis [Satan] in his jahl [ignorance], and thus falling into shirk [opposite of Tawhid]&quot;.

===Secularism===
In many jurisdictions of the world, the laws and the people&#x27;s general attitude hold that the sphere of public life should be secular and that belief in and the practice of religion should remain in the sphere of private life. One motive for adopting that stance has been to reduce the effects of conflicts between followers of different religions or between adherents of secularism and those of a religion. In public life, that view insists that the authority of the state prevails over any religious authorities.

For some Islamic thinkers, these propositions infringe the doctrine of tawhid and are therefore anathema. If the cosmos is a unified and harmonious whole, centred on the omnipotent and omnipresent God, they hold that recognising any other authority as superior is wrong. According to one writer, &quot;Traditionally, a Muslim is not a nationalist, or citizen of a nation-state; he has no political identity, only a religious membership in the Umma. For a traditional Muslim, Islam is the sole and sufficient identification tag and nationalism and nation-states are obstacles&quot;. Hence the idea of creating a wholly Islamic state, or a revived caliphate.

In practice, nearly all Muslims live their daily lives under some national jurisdiction and accept at least part of the constraints this involves.

===Islamic art===
The desire to preserve the unity and the transcendence of God has led to the prohibition of Muslims from creating representation or visual depictions of God, or of any Prophet including Muhammad. Representation in art of the human form is a disputed matter in fiqh. The key concern is that the use of statues or images may lead to idolatry. The dominant forms of expression in the Islamic art, thus, became calligraphy and arabesque.

<doc id="192524" wikidata="Q157411" url="?curid=192524" title="Colchicum">
<text>Colchicum ( or ) is a genus of perennial flowering plants containing around 160 species which grow from bulb-like corms. It is a member of the botanical family Colchicaceae, and is native to West Asia, Europe, parts of the Mediterranean coast, down the East African coast to South Africa and the Western Cape. In this genus, the ovary of the flower is underground. As a consequence, the styles are extremely long in proportion, often more than . All species in the genus are toxic.

==Common names==
The common names autumn crocus, meadow saffron and naked lady may be applied to the whole genus or to many of its species; they refer to the &quot;naked&quot; crocus-like flowers that appear in late summer or autumn, long before the strap-like foliage which appears in spring.

&quot;Colchicum&quot; and &quot;Crocus&quot; look alike and can be confused by the casual observer. To add to the confusion, there are autumn-flowering species of crocus. However, colchicums have 3 styles and 6 stamens, while crocuses have 1 style supporting 3 long stigmas and 3 stamens. In addition, the corm structures are quite different—in &quot;Colchicum&quot;, the corm is irregular, while in crocuses, the corm is like a flattened ball. &quot;Crocus&quot; is in the iris family, Iridaceae.

==Etymology==
The name of the genus derives from Κολχίς (Colchis), the Ancient Greek name for the region of კოლხეთი (Kolkhida) in modern Georgia (Caucasus). Colchis features in Greek mythology as the land to which the Argonauts journeyed in quest of the golden fleece and where Jason encountered Medea. The Greek toponym &quot;Colchis&quot; is thought by scholars to derive from the Urartian &quot;Qulḫa&quot;, pronounced &quot;Kolcha&quot; (guttural &quot;ch&quot; - as in Scots &quot;loch&quot;).

==Relationships==
&quot;Colchicum melanthioides&quot;, also known as &quot;Androcymbium melanthioides&quot;, is probably the best known species from the tropical regions. In contrast to most temperate colchicums, the flower and leaves are produced at the same time, the white flowers usually in a small corymb that is enclosed by white bracts. Close relatives such as &quot;Colchicum scabromarginatum&quot; (&quot;Androcymbium scabromarginatum&quot;) and &quot;Colchicum coloratum&quot; (&quot;Androcymbium burchellii&quot;) have flowers with very short stalks and may be pollinated by rodents.

==Cultivation==
Temperate colchicums are commonly grown in gardens as ornamental flowers. Species found in cultivation include:
*&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;agrippinum&quot;
*&quot;C. autumnale&quot;
*&quot;C.&quot; × &quot;byzantinum&quot;
*&quot;C. cilicicum&quot;
*&quot;C. lusitanum&quot;
*&quot;C. speciosum&quot;
*&quot;C. tenorei&quot;
There are also cultivars and hybrids such as:-
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Dick Trotter&#x27; (violet with white centre)
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Disraeli&#x27; (purple white),
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Giant&#x27; (red with white centre)
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Harlekijn&#x27; (white with purple band)
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Lilac Wonder&#x27; (lilac)
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Pink Goblet&#x27; (violet-purple)
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Poseidon&#x27; (purple) 
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Rosy Dawn&#x27; (rose pink)
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Violet Queen&#x27; (purple)
*&quot;C.&quot; &#x27;Waterlily&#x27; (double, lilac-pink)
Those marked have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017).

In the United Kingdom, the National Collection of colchicums is maintained at Felbrigg Hall, Norfolk.

==Medicinal uses and poisonous properties==
Plants in this genus contain toxic amounts of the alkaloid colchicine which is used pharmaceutically to treat gout and Familial Mediterranean fever. The use of the roots and seeds in traditional medicine is thought to have arisen due to the presence of this drug.

Its leaves, corm and seeds are poisonous. Murderer Catherine Wilson is thought to have used it to poison a number of victims in the 19th century. The species known to contain the most lethal amount of colchicine is &quot;C. autumnale&quot;.

==Species==
The following are the species included in the genus &quot;Colchicum&quot;. Many species previously classified in &quot;Androcymbium&quot;, &quot;Bulbocodium&quot; and &quot;Merendera&quot; were moved to &quot;Colchicum&quot; based on molecular genetic evidence. &quot;Androcymbium&quot; is currently considered a separate genus by some.

<text>The Chief of the Name, or in older English usage Captain of his Nation, is the recognised head of a family or clan (Irish and Scottish Gaelic: &quot;fine&quot;) in Ireland and Scotland.

==Ireland==
There are instances where Norman lords of the time like FitzGerald and Burke took to using the Gaelic style of &quot;The&quot; or &quot;Mór&quot; (great) to indicate that the individual was the primary person of his family in Ireland. Chiefs were elected from their clan&#x27;s &quot;Derbfine&quot;, a group of cousins who were all at least the great-grandsons of former chiefs. 

During the Tudor conquest of Ireland the Kingdom of Ireland was established by Henry VIII in 1542, and many of the former autonomous clan chiefs were assimilated under the English legal system via the policy of surrender and regrant. At the same time mentions were made in official records of locally-powerful landlords described as &quot;chief of his nation&quot;, i.e. head of a family, whether assimilated or not. Attempts were made by the English to make each &quot;chief&quot; responsible for the good behaviour of the rest of his family and followers. The Gaelic practice was for such a man to sign himself by the family surname only. A new practice arose where the English version of the surname was in many instances prefixed by &quot;The&quot;, and so for example the head of the &quot;Mac Aonghusa&quot; clan in County Down would sign as &quot;Mac Aonghusa&quot; in Irish, and as &quot;The Magennis&quot; in English.

After the 9 Years War Ireland saw a downfall of the Gaelic order which led to a decline of the power of the chiefs. Plantations of Ireland and the wars of Oliver Cromwell and King James meant that by the end of the century many of the Chiefships of the Name were living outside Ireland, reduced to poverty or lost forever.

Thereafter, those former kings or chiefs who had been assimilated under the English legal system passed their titles down by primogeniture, whereas the usual Irish practice in the Middle Ages was to elect a chief from a group of close cousins known as a derbfine. Some chiefs did not assimilate under the English legal system, but relied on the system of succession provided for under Irish Brehon Law. The lineages of assimilated chiefs were usually recorded by the Herald&#x27;s Office in Dublin Castle, set up in 1552, not least because many clans in the 16th and 17th centuries had been persuaded to enter the English-law system under the policy of surrender and regrant. Other manuscript genealogies were preserved and published in the 18th century by Charles O&#x27;Conor and Sylvester O&#x27;Halloran. The Irish nationalist and republican movements that developed after 1850 often harked back emotively to the former chiefs&#x27; losses.

===1922–2003===

The Irish Free State, founded in 1922, gave no special recognition to the concept, but in 1938, the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, at the inauguration of Dr. Douglas Hyde as the first President of Ireland, welcomed the incoming President with these words: &quot;In you we greet the successor of our rightful princes and in your accession to office we hail the closing of the breach that has existed since the undoing of our nation at Kinsale&quot;. In 1948 the government suggested that there should be a &quot;Council&quot; of chiefs, accredited by the Herald, for emotive reasons. In Irish and English law a title is a possession, classed as an &quot;incorporeal hereditament&quot;, but the 1937 Irish Constitution forbids the conferring of titles of nobility by the state, as well as the acceptance of titles of nobility or honour without the prior permission of the government. Therefore, the council was also a means of allowing them to use their titles, but only as honorifics and without any political function. In 1943 the Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) agreed with Edward McLysaght, then Chief Herald of Ireland, that the titles would be known as &quot;designations&quot; made by the Herald&#x27;s Office to avoid the constitutional ban. McLysaght deplored that anyone could perfectly legally describe themselves as &quot;chief of the name&quot; (such as The O&#x27;Rahilly) without having any written proof of descent, if nobody else claimed the very same title.

Effectively a dual system ran from 1948 to 2003, where the government recognised the chiefs as such, but not their other titles. In such a case, for example, The McDermot, Prince of Coolavin would only be known as &quot;The McDermot&quot; to the Chief Herald, but would be addressed also as &quot;Prince of Coolavin&quot; by his fellow chiefs.

Until 2003, an Irish &quot;Chief of the Name&quot; was a person recognised by the Chief Herald of Ireland as the most senior known male descendant of the last inaugurated or de facto chief of that name in power in Gaelic Ireland at or before the end of the 16th century. The practice was discontinued in 2003 owing to the &quot;MacCarthy Mór&quot; fraud (below).

===Abandonment and MacCarthy Mór scandal===
After genealogical errors in the 1990s saw Terence Francis MacCarthy and other impostors receive recognition, the Irish government decided in July 2003 to abandon this practice. This was partly because of concern that there was no proper legal basis for it. As this concern was backed by an opinion of the Attorney General, in 2003 the Genealogical Office discontinued the practice of recognising Chiefs. This decision was a cause for concern among the recognised chiefs.

Some modern Irish clan organisations have elected honorary chieftains, where no Chief of the Name is known or yet to be proven. Some re-formed Irish clans are affiliated with the &quot;Finte na hÉireann&quot; or Clans of Ireland, an organisation established in 1989 to maintain a register of affiliated Irish clans.

===Gaelic titles ===
In 1896, Jorge O&#x27;Neill of Portugal submitted his genealogy to the Somerset Herald in London. Five years later, Sir Henry Farnham Burke, KCVO, CB, FSA, Somerset Herald stated in 1900 that &quot;the only Pedigree at present on record in either of the Offices of Arms showing a lineal male descent from the House of O&#x27;Neill, Monarchs of Ireland, Kings of Ulster, and Princes of Tyrone and Claneboy, is the one registered in the fifty-ninth year of the Reign of Our Sovereign Lady Victoria, in favor of His Excellency Jorge O&#x27;Neill of Lisbon&quot;. He then recognised him as the Representative of the House of O&#x27;Neill and as the Representative of the Earldom created in 1542 for his kinsman Conn Baccagh O&#x27;Neill. All of this was granted under Letters Patent issued by the English College of Heralds. Later, the Ulster and Norroy King of Arms granted him the undifferenced arms as the head of the House of O&#x27;Neill. Upon that Letters Patent, Pope Leo XIII, the King of Spain, and the King of Portugal recognised Jorge O&#x27;Neill as the Prince of Clanaboy, Tyrone, Ulster, as the Count of Tyrone, and the Head of the Royal House of O&#x27;Neill and all of its septs. The grandson of Jorge and present Prince of Clanaboy, Hugo, has not pressed his senior claim to the entire House of O&#x27;Neill out of respect for his O&#x27;Neill chief cousins and their own histories.

==Scotland==

In general, the same pattern holds true of the clan chiefs in Scotland as for chiefs in Ireland. Titles may vary, but a chief of a clan is still the recognised leader within a Scottish clan. A difference is that in Scotland clan chiefs can be either male or female whereas in Ireland the clan chiefs are invariably male. In Scotland it is the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs; in Ireland it is the Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains (). In Scotland there exists an &#x27;Ad Hoc Derbhfine&#x27; approach to the selection of a new chiefly family when it has been determined that no verifiable descent from a former chief exists. Some have advocated that a similar approach be used in Ireland where chiefships have been lost to history.

<doc id="192532" wikidata="Q356118" url="?curid=192532" title="Ōkubo Toshimichi">
<text>(26 September 1830 – 14 May 1878) was a Japanese statesman and one of the Three Great Nobles regarded as the main founders of modern Japan.

Ōkubo was a &quot;samurai&quot; of the Satsuma Domain and joined the movement to overthrow the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate during the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; period. Upon the founding of the new Empire of Japan, Ōkubo became a leading member of the Meiji Restoration and a prominent member of the Meiji oligarchy. 

Following his return from the Iwakura Mission in 1873, Ōkubo became Lord of Home Affairs and used his office&#x27;s authority to rapidly expand his influence within the Restoration government. Shortly thereafter, he firmly established himself as the nation&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; dictator. In this capacity, he enacted numerous structural reforms, pacified disputes within the Meiji regime at the Osaka Conference of 1875, and suppressed several rebellions threatening the survival of the empire. As a result of his autocratic style of government, Ōkubo became the focus of deep animosity within Japan and was ultimately assassinated in 1878 by a former member of Saigo Takamori&#x27;s rebel army.

==Early life==

Ōkubo was born on 26 September 1830 in Kagoshima, Satsuma Province (present-day Kagoshima Prefecture) to Ōkubo Juemon (also known as Toshio and Shirō), a low-ranking retainer of Shimazu Nariakira, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Satsuma Domain, later given a minor official position, and his wife Minayoshi Fuku, daughter of a physician. Although the Ōkubo family were not of high status, they were of distinguished origin, thought to descend from the noble Fujiwara clan. The eldest of five children, Ōkubo studied at the same local school as Saigō Takamori, who was three years older. In 1846, Ōkubo was given the position of aide to the Satsuma Domain&#x27;s archivist.

==Satsuma samurai==

Shimazu Nariakira recognized Ōkubo&#x27;s talents and appointed him to the position of tax administrator in 1858. When Nariakira died that year, Ōkubo joined the plot to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate, the &quot;de facto&quot; military dictatorship that had ruled Japan as a feudal state since 1600. Unlike most Satsuma leaders, Ōkubo favored the position of &quot;tōbaku&quot; (倒幕, overthrowing the shogunate), as opposed to &quot;kōbu gattai&quot; (, unity of the Imperial court and the Shogunate) and &quot;hanbaku&quot; (opposition to the shogunate) over the &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot; movement.

The outcome of the Anglo-Satsuma War of 1863, along with the Namamugi Incident and the September 1863 coup d&#x27;état in Kyoto, convinced Ōkubo that the &quot;tōbaku&quot; movement was doomed. In 1866, Ōkubo met with Saigō Takamori and Chōshū Domain&#x27;s Kido Junichirō to form the secret Satchō Alliance to overthrow the Tokugawa through the mediation of Sakamoto Ryōma of Tosa Domain.

==Meiji restoration==
On January 3, 1868, forces from Satsuma and Chōshū seized the Kyoto Imperial Palace and proclaimed the Meiji Restoration. Thereafter, 
with the help of the influential courtier, Iwakura Tomomi, the &quot;Three Great Nobles of the Restoration&quot; (Ōkubo, Saigō and Kido) formed a provisional government. At its inception, the Meiji regime had to rely on funds from the Tokugawa lands (which were seized &quot;in toto&quot;).

As head of the department of internal affairs, Ōkubo had a huge amount of power through his control of all local government appointments and the police force. In this capacity, he was able to appoint all new leaders within the state bureaucracy. Most of the people he appointed as governors were young men; some included friends such as Matsukata Masayoshi while others were rare Japanese who had gained some education in Europe or the United States.

As Finance Minister in 1871, Ōkubo enacted a Land Tax Reform, the Haitōrei Edict, which prohibited &quot;samurai&quot; from wearing swords in public, and ended official discrimination against the outcasts. In foreign relations, he worked to secure revision of the unequal treaties and joined the Iwakura Mission on its round-the-world trip of 1871 to 1873. Realizing that Japan was not in any position to challenge the Western powers in its new present state, Ōkubo returned to Japan on September 13, 1873, just in time to take a strong stand against Saigō&#x27;s proposed invasion of Korea (&quot;Seikanron&quot;).

Upon assuming the new position of Lord of Home Affairs in November 1873, Okubo consolidated power to become the dominant voice within the Restoration regime. As Home Lord (内務卿), Ōkubo promoted industrial development building roads, bridges, and ports—all things that the Tokugawa shogunate had refused to do. In response to calls for a representative assembly, he presided over the Osaka Conference of 1875 to reconcile opposing views on the subject within the Meiji oligarchy. While the conference resulted in the creation of an Assembly of prefectural governors and a senate-like body called the Genro-in, the positions to such bodies were appointive rather than elective and the authority to sanction laws was denied to the latter. In 1877, Okubo was faced with the prospect of open rebellion when forces in Satsuma under the command of his old friend, Saigo Takamori, took up arms against the Meiji regime to end its nationwide campaign of enforced modernization. Ōkubo took personal command of the government army and crushed the rebellion, thereby resulting in Saigo&#x27;s death.

After suppressing a rebellion originating in his own province, many Satsuma samurai considered Ōkubo a traitor. On May 14, 1878, Ōkubo was assassinated by Shimada Ichirō and six other Kaga Domain samurai on his way to the imperial palace, only a few minutes&#x27; walk from the Sakurada gate where Ii Naosuke had been assassinated 18 years earlier.

==Legacy==
Ōkubo was one of the most influential leaders of the Meiji Restoration and the establishment of modern governmental structures. From November 1873, when he was made Home Affairs Minister also known as the Lords of Home Affairs (a newly created post), until his death in 1878, he was the most powerful man in Japan. A devout loyalist and nationalist, he enjoyed the respect of his colleagues and enemies alike.

==Personal life==
Ōkubo married Hayasaki Masako , with whom he had four sons and a daughter. His children from this marriage were Toshikazu, the 1st Marquess Ōkubo (1859–1945), Makino Nobuaki (1861–1949), Toshitake, later the 2nd Marquess (1867–1943), Ishihara Takeguma (1869–1943), who was adopted by his wife Yaeko&#x27;s family, and Yoshiko, who married Ijuin Hikokichi.

Ōkubo&#x27;s second son, Makino Nobuaki, and his son-in-law Ijuin Hikokichi served as Foreign Minister. Future Prime Minister of Japan Tarō Asō and Princess Tomohito of Mikasa are great-great-grandchildren of Ōkubo Toshimichi.

In 1884, Toshikazu was ennobled as a marquess in the new peerage in honour of his father&#x27;s achievements. He married Shigeno Naoko (1875–1918), but had no children and relinquished the title in 1928 in favour of his younger brother Toshitake (1865–1943). A graduate of Yale and Heidelberg universities, Toshitake successively served as governor of Tottori (1900), Ōita (1901–1905), Saitama (1905–1907) and Osaka (1912–1917) prefectures. He married Kondō Sakae (1879–1956) and had three children, Toshiaki (1900–1995), Toshimasa (1902–1945) and Michitada (b. 1907). Toshiaki became a prominent professor of Japanese history and succeeded as the 3rd Marquess in 1943, holding the title until the peerage was abolished in 1947. He subsequently became the librarian of the National Diet Library from 1951 to 1953 and then taught as a lecturer and professor of history at Nagoya University (1953–1959) and at Rikkyū University (1959–1965). He was awarded the Asahi Prize in 1993, two years before his death. He married Yoneda Yaeko (b. 1910) and had two children, Yasushi (b. 1934) and Shigeko (b. 1936). Yasushi married Matsudaira Naoko (b. 1940) and had a daughter, Akiko (b. 1965).

Ōkubo also had four illegitimate children by a mistress.

== In fiction ==
In the manga/anime series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, Ōkubo Toshimichi appears to seek Himura Kenshin&#x27;s assistance in destroying the threat posed by the revolt of Shishio Makoto. Kenshin is uncertain, and Ōkubo gives him a May 14 deadline to make his decision. On his way to seek Kenshin&#x27;s answer on that day, he is supposedly assassinated by Seta Sōjirō, Shishio&#x27;s right-hand man, and the Ichirō clan desecrates his corpse and claim they killed him. (Watsuki makes a comparison to President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, with Ōkubo in his notes).

In Boris Akunin&#x27;s novel &quot;The Diamond Chariot&quot;, Erast Fandorin investigates the plot to assassinate Ōkubo but fails to prevent the assassination.

<text>was a Japanese field marshal, and one of the founders of the Imperial Japanese Army. He was representative of the outstanding military commanders of the late modern period.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Ōyama was born in Kagoshima to a &quot;samurai&quot; family of the Satsuma Domain. He was a younger paternal cousin to Saigo Takamori. A protégé of Ōkubo Toshimichi, he worked to overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate and thus played a major role in the Meiji Restoration. He served as the commander of the Detached First Brigade during the Boshin War. At the Battle of Aizu, Ōyama was the commander of the Satchōdo&#x27;s field artillery positions on Mount Oda. During the course of the siege, he was wounded by an Aizu guerilla force under Sagawa Kanbei.

Since at least 1904, local accounts have confused Ōyama Iwao with Sukeichi Oyama (1858-1922), Japanese engraver who studied at Temple Hill Academy in Geneseo, New York, United States. 

===Military career===

In 1870, Ōyama was sent overseas to the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France (August 1870 – March 1871) to study and was appointed the official Japanese military observer to the Franco-Prussian War. He also spent three years (July 1871 – October 1874) in Geneva studying foreign languages, and became fluent in Russian. Ōyama Iwao is the first recorded Japanese customer for Louis Vuitton, having purchased some luggage during his stay in France. After promotion to major general, he went to France again for further study, together with Kawakami Sōroku. On his return home, he helped establish the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army, which was soon employed in suppressing the Satsuma Rebellion, although Ōyama and his elder brother were cousins of Saigō Takamori.

In the First Sino-Japanese War, Ōyama was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Second Army, which after landing on Liaodong Peninsula, carried Port Arthur by storm, and subsequently crossed to Shandong, where it captured the fortress of Weihaiwei. After the war, Ōyama was disparaged by American reporter Trumbull White for failing to restrain his troops during the Port Arthur Massacre.

For his services Ōyama received the title of marquis under the &quot;kazoku&quot; peerage system, and, three years later in January 1898, he became a field-marshal. In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 he was appointed the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese armies in Manchuria. As Supreme Commander of the Japanese Manchurian Army, Ōyama had complete authority over all Japanese land operations during the war, and personally directed the tactics of Japanese forces in all major battles, winning the Battle of Liaoyang and repulsing Russian counter-attacks at the Battle of Shaho and the Battle of Sandepu. He was replaced by General Kodama Gentarō briefly during early 1905 due to illness, but recovered to direct Japanese forces in the final Battle of Mukden.

After Japan&#x27;s victory, Emperor Meiji elevated him in September 1907 to the rank of , the highest rank of the Empire of Japan.

===Political career and death===

As the War Minister in several cabinets and as the Chief of the Army General Staff, Ōyama upheld the autocratic power of the oligarchs (&quot;genrō&quot;) against democratic encroachments. However, unlike Yamagata Aritomo, Ōyama was reserved and tended to shun politics. From 1914 to his death he served as the , and in this capacity attended the accession ceremony of the Emperor Taishō, which took place in Kyoto in November 1915.

In 1906, Ōyama was awarded the Order of Merit by King Edward VII. His Japanese decorations included Order of the Golden Kite (1st class) and Order of the Chrysanthemum.

Ōyama died at the age of seventy five in 1916, and was accorded a state funeral. Ōyama was a large man, and enjoyed large meals. His weight exceeded , and may have contributed to his death, possibly arising from diabetes.

==Personal life==

===Family===

Ōyama&#x27;s first wife Sawa died of puerperal disorder. Second wife Sutematsu (a survivor of the Battle of Aizu, a sister of former Aizu retainers Yamakawa Hiroshi and Yamakawa Kenjirō) was one of the first female students sent to the United States as part of the Iwakura Mission in the early 1870s. She spent eleven years there, graduating from Vassar College in 1882. In the next year she accepted her former enemy&#x27;s proposal.

Ōyama was Emperor Meiji&#x27;s first candidate for rearing future emperor Hirohito as a sort of surrogate father in 1901, in accordance with royal customs, but Ōyama declined and the role instead went to Count Kawamura Sumiyoshi.

Ōyama&#x27;s first son Takashi, a navy cadet, died in the accidental explosion and sinking of the cruiser in 1908. His second son became an archaeologist after he retired from the army.

===House===

Ōyama, who spoke and wrote several European languages fluently, also liked European-style architecture. During his tenure as the War Minister, he built a large house in Tokyo modelled after a German castle.

Although he was very pleased with the design, his wife Sutematsu did not like it at all, and insisted that the children&#x27;s room be remodelled in Japanese style, so that they would not forget their Japanese heritage. The house was destroyed by the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 or possibly by American air raids during World War II .

==Kimigayo==

In 1869, the British military band instructor John William Fenton, who was then working in Yokohama as an &quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot;, told the members of Japan&#x27;s military band about the British national anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; and emphasised the necessity of a similar national anthem for Japan. The band members requested artillery Captain Ōyama Iwao, who was well versed in Japanese and Chinese literature, to select appropriate words and Ōyama selected the poem which came to be used in Japan&#x27;s national anthem &quot;kimigayo.&quot;

<doc id="192539" wikidata="Q3274031" url="?curid=192539" title="USS Illinois (BB-7)">
<text>USS &quot;Illinois&quot; (BB-7) was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the United States Navy. She was the lead ship of the , and was the second ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for the 21st state. Her keel was laid down in February 1897 at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company, and she was launched in October 1898. She was commissioned in September 1901. The ship was armed with a main battery of four guns and she had a top speed of .

&quot;Illinois&quot; served with the European Squadron from 1902 to 1903, and with the North Atlantic Fleet until 1907, by which time it had been renamed the Atlantic Fleet. During this time, she accidentally collided with two other battleships. From December 1907 to February 1909, she circumnavigated the globe with the Great White Fleet. From November 1912, the ship was used as a training ship. She was lent to the state of New York in 1919 for use as a training vessel for the New York Naval Militia. The ship was converted into a floating armory in 1924 as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty, and it was as a floating armory, barracks and school that she served for the next thirty years. In January 1941 she was reclassified as IX-15 and renamed Prairie State so that her former name could be given to , a new . &quot;Prairie State&quot; was ultimately sold for scrap in 1956.

==Description==
Design work on the of pre-dreadnought battleships began in 1896, at which time the United States Navy had few modern battleships in service. Initial debate over whether to build a new low-freeboard design like the s in service or a higher-freeboard vessel like (then under construction) led to a decision to adopt the latter type. The mixed secondary armament of guns of previous classes was standardized to just 6-inch weapons to save weight and simplify ammunition supplies. Another major change was the introduction of modern, balanced turrets with sloped faces instead of the older &quot;Monitor&quot;-style turrets of earlier American battleships.

&quot;Illinois&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which were ducted into a pair of funnels placed side by side. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 536 officers and enlisted men, which increased to 690–713.

She was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns in two twin-gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in individual casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns, also mounted individually in casemates along the side of the hull, and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Illinois&quot; carried four  torpedo tubes in deck mounted launchers.

&quot;Illinois&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating on their exposed sides. Armor that was 6 in thick protected the secondary battery. The conning tower had thick sides.

== Service history ==
===Construction – 1906===
&quot;Illinois&quot; was laid down on 10 February 1897 by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 4 October 1898 and commissioned on 16 September 1901. The ship&#x27;s first commander was Captain George A. Converse. &quot;Illinois&quot; was the first member of her class to be authorized, but the last to enter service. After commissioning, the ship began a shakedown cruise in the Chesapeake Bay, followed by initial training. She left the area on 20 November to test a new floating dry dock in Algiers, Louisiana. The ship was back in Newport News in January 1902. She served briefly as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans from 15 to 28 February; during this period, she took part in a reception for Prince Henry of Prussia, the brother of the German Kaiser.

On 30 April, now flying the flag of Rear Admiral A.S. Crowninshield, &quot;Illinois&quot; departed for a tour of Europe. She stopped in Naples, Italy on 18 May; here, Crowninshield took command of the European Squadron. &quot;Illinois&quot; took part in training exercises and ceremonial duties in European waters for the next two months, until 14 July, when she ran aground outside Oslo, Norway. She had to steam to Britain for repairs, which were carried out at Chatham. She left the port on 1 September for maneuvers with the rest of the fleet in the Mediterranean and South Atlantic.

On 10 January 1903, &quot;Illinois&quot; was reassigned to the North Atlantic Fleet, where she remained for the next four years. Her time was occupied with peacetime training exercises, gunnery practice, and various ceremonial activities. During this period, she was involved in two accidents with other battleships of the North Atlantic Fleet. The first took place on 30 March 1903, when she collided with . The second collision occurred on 31 July 1906, and took place with her sister ship . Also that year, &quot;Illinois&quot; was the first ship to win the Battenberg Cup.

===Great White Fleet===
The ship&#x27;s next significant action was the cruise of the Great White Fleet around the world, which started with a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Hampton Roads. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression.

On 17 December, the fleet steamed out of Hampton Roads and cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.

After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. While there, the American fleet received word of an earthquake in Sicily. &quot;Illinois&quot;, the battleship , and the supply ship were sent to assist the relief effort. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for Theodore Roosevelt.

===Later career===
On 4 August 1909, &quot;Illinois&quot; was decommissioned in Boston. The ship then underwent a major modernization, receiving new &quot;cage&quot; masts and more modern equipment. She spent the next three years in active service with the fleet, before being decommissioned once more on 16 April 1912. She returned to service on 2 November for major training maneuvers with the Atlantic Fleet. &quot;Illinois&quot; made training cruises to Europe with midshipmen from the US Naval Academy in mid-1913 and 1914. By 1919, she had been decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 23 October 1921, she was loaned to the New York Naval Militia for training purposes. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated significant reductions in naval strength, stipulated that &quot;Illinois&quot; must be rendered incapable of warlike action. As a result, she was converted into a floating armory at the New York Navy Yard in 1924 and was assigned to the New York Naval Reserve.

On 8 January 1941, the ship was reclassified from BB-7 to IX-15, and was renamed &quot;Prairie State&quot; so that her name could be used for the new battleship , which would be laid down a week later. Throughout World War II, she served with the U.S. Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School, based in New York. After the end of the war, &quot;Prairie State&quot; was kept as a barracks ship for a Naval Reserve unit. On 31 December 1955, the old ship was stricken and subsequently towed to Baltimore, where she was sold for scrap to Bethlehem Steel on 18 May 1956.

<text>The Martin Marietta SM-68A/HGM-25A Titan I was the United States&#x27; first multistage intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), in use from 1959 until 1962. Though the SM-68A was operational for only three years, it spawned numerous follow-on models that were a part of the U.S. arsenal and space launch capability. The Titan I was unique among the Titan models in that it used liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants; all subsequent versions used storable propellants instead.

Originally designed as a backup in case the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s SM-65 Atlas missile development ran into problems, the Titan was ultimately beaten into service by Atlas. Deployment went ahead anyway to more rapidly increase the number of missiles on alert and because the Titan&#x27;s missile silo basing was more survivable than Atlas.

The succeeding LGM-25C Titan II served in the U.S. nuclear deterrent until 1987 and had increased capacity and range in addition to the different propellants.

==History==
By January 1955, the size of nuclear weapons had been shrinking dramatically, allowing the possibility of building a bomb that could be carried by a missile of reasonable size. The Titan I program began on the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Committee. The committee presented to the United States Air Force (USAF) their findings of the technical feasibility to develop weapons (bombs) and their delivery systems (intercontinental range ballistic missiles) that were completely invulnerable to &quot;surprise&quot; attack.

The reduction in the mass of nuclear warheads allowed full coverage of the entire Sino-Soviet land mass, and the missile control capabilities were also upgraded. The Titan I would be fully independent in controlled flight from launch to the ballistic release of the warhead, which would descend to its target by the combination of gravity and air resistance alone. In May 1955 the Air Materiel Command invited contractors to submit proposals and bids for the two stage Titan I ICBM, formally beginning the program. In September 1955, The Martin Company was declared the contractor for the Titan missile. In early October the Air Force&#x27;s Western Development Division was ordered to start work. The Titan was developed in parallel with the Atlas (SM-65/HGM-16) ICBM, serving as a backup with potentially greater capabilities and an incentive for the Atlas contractor to work harder. Martin was selected as the contractor due to its proposed organization and method of igniting a liquid fueled engine at high altitude.

The Titan I was initially designated as a bomber aircraft (B-68), but was later designated SM-68 Titan and finally HGM-25A in 1962.

===Program management===
The previous strategic missile programs of the Air Force had been administered using the &quot;single prime contractor concept&quot; (later called the weapon system concept). This had resulted in three badly botched programs; the programs of the Snark, Navaho and RASCAL missiles had slipped an average of 5 years and had cost overruns of 300 per cent or more. In response, the Teapot Committee was tasked with evaluating requirements for ballistic missiles and methods of accelerating their development. As a result of the ensuing recommendations, the USAF established the Western Development Division and Brigadier General Bernard Schriever was detailed to command it. Schriever devised an entirely new organization for program management. The Air Force was to act as &quot;prime contractor,&quot; the Ramo-Woolridge Corporation was contracted to provide systems engineering and technical direction of all ballistic missiles. The airframe contractor also would assemble the sub-systems provided by other Air Force contractors. At the time, this new organization was very controversial.

The Titan I represented an evolution of technology when compared to the Atlas missile program, but shared many of the Atlas&#x27; problems. The liquid oxygen oxidizer could not be stored for long periods of time, increasing the response time as the missile had to be raised out of its silo and loaded with oxidizer before a launch could occur. The main improvements of the Titan I over the first Atlas&#x27;s deployed were vertical storage in a fully underground silo and an improved fully internal inertial guidance system. Later Atlas E/F models were equipped with what would have been the Titan I&#x27;s guidance system The Titan I would be deployed with the Bell Labs radio-inertial guidance system.

===Budgetary problems===
The Titan, proposed as a fallback in case the Atlas failed, was by December 1956 accepted by some as a &quot;principal ingredient of the national ballistic missile force.&quot; At the same time, others pushed for the cancellation of the Titan program almost from the beginning, arguing that it was redundant. Despite counterarguments that the Titan offered greater performance and growth potential than the Atlas as a missile and space launch vehicle, the Titan program was under constant budgetary pressure. In the summer of 1957 budget cuts led Secretary of Defense Wilson to reduce the Titan production rate from the proposed seven per month to two a month, which left the Titan as a research and development program only. However, the Sputnik crisis, which started 5 October 1957, ended any talk of canceling Titan. Priority was restored, and 1958 saw increases in funding and plans for additional Titan squadrons.

===Flight testing===
The Titan I flight testing consisted of the first stage only Series I, the cancelled Series II, and Series III with the complete missile.

A total of 62 flight test missiles were constructed in various numbers. The first successful launch was on 5 February 1959 with Titan I A3, and the last test flight was on 29 January 1962 with Titan I M7. Of the missiles produced, 49 launched and two exploded: six A-types (four launched), seven B-types (two launched), six C-types (five launched), ten G-types (seven launched), 22 J-types (22 launched), four V-types (four launched), and seven M-types (seven launched). Missiles were tested and launched in Florida at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station from Launch Complexes LC15, LC16, LC19, and LC20.

The four A-type missile launches with dummy second stages all occurred in 1959 and were carried out on 6 February, 25 February, 3 April, and 4 May. The guidance system and stage separation all performed well, and aerodynamic drag was lower than anticipated. Titan I was the first program to have a new missile succeed on the initial attempt, which left launch crews unprepared for the series of failures that followed. Missile B-4 exploded from a LOX pump failure during a static firing at Martin&#x27;s Denver test stand in May and assorted other mishaps occurred in the following two months.

Missile B-5 was intended to launch from LC-19 as the first flight article Lot B missile, incorporating most Titan I missile systems but with a dummy warhead. A planned launch on July 31 was scrubbed due to fuel system problems. At about noon on August 5, B-5 was launched. The missile rose about ten feet before the engines shut down and it fell back onto LC-19 in a fiery explosion. Postflight investigation found that the hold-down bolts released prematurely, causing B-5 to lift before full thrust rise had been achieved. A still-attached umbilical sent a shutdown command to the engines. LC-19 was badly damaged and would not be used again for six months.

Further problems occurred over the next several months. Missiles continued to be damaged through careless personnel mistakes and General Osmond Ritland sent Martin an angry letter calling their handling of the Titan program &quot;inexcusable.&quot; Ritland&#x27;s disciplinary blast had little effect for the time being. On December 10, the first attempt was made to launch a Lot C missile, which would be a complete Titan I with all systems and a detachable warhead. Missile C-3 was prepared for launch but much like with B-5, a premature shutdown command was sent due to failure of an umbilical to detach, fortunately the missile had not been released from the pad. The umbilical was quickly repaired but any relief at having avoided near-disaster was short-lived.

At 1:11 PM EST on December 12, Missile C-3 launched from LC-16. The engines started, but the missile almost immediately disappeared in a fireball. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off. Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile and testing confirmed that the shock from the pad hold-down bolts firing was enough to set off the relay. The pad was not as badly damaged as LC-19 had been from the B-5 mishap as C-3 had not actually lifted and it was repaired in only two months.

On 2 February 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7A marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage—this was a composite missile as B-7&#x27;s original upper stage was damaged months earlier in an accident and it was replaced with the upper stage from Missile B-6 which had had its first stage damaged in another accident. On 5 February, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate. The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30–40 miles downrange After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on 24 February, Missile C-1&#x27;s second stage failed to ignite on 8 March due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting. The last Lot C missile was C-6 which flew successfully on April 28. The Lot G missiles incorporated several design improvements to correct problems encountered on previous Titan launches. On 1 July, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan&#x27;s engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared. The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrieved—it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure. The sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.

The next launch at the end of the month (Missile J-4) suffered premature first stage shutdown and landed far short of its planned impact point. Cause of the failure was a LOX valve closing prematurely, which resulted in the rupture of a propellant duct and thrust termination. Missile J-6 on 24 October set a record by flying 6100 miles. The J series resulted in minor changes to alleviate the second stage shutting down prematurely or failing to ignite.

The string of failures during 1959–60 led to complaints from the Air Force that Martin–Marietta weren&#x27;t taking the Titan project seriously (since it was just a backup to the primary Atlas ICBM program) and displayed an indifferent, careless attitude that resulted in easily avoidable failure modes such as Missile C-3&#x27;s range safety command destruct system relays being placed in a vibration-prone area.
In December, Missile V-2 was undergoing a flight readiness test in a silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The plan was to load the missile with propellant, raise it up to firing position, and then lower it back into the silo. Unfortunately, the silo elevator collapsed, causing the Titan to fall back down and explode. The blast was so violent that it ejected a service tower from inside the silo and launched it some distance into the air before coming back down.

A total of 21 Titan I launches took place during 1961, with five failures. On 20 January 1961, Missile AJ-10 launched from LC-19 at CCAS. The flight ended in failure when an improper disconnect of a pad umbilical caused an electrical short in the second stage. The Titan performed well through the first stage burn, but after second stage separation, the fuel valve to the gas generator failed to open, preventing engine start. Missiles AJ-12 and AJ-15 in March were lost due to turbopump problems. Missile M-1&#x27;s second stage lost thrust when the hydraulic pump failed. Missile SM-2 experienced early first stage shutdown; although the second stage burn was successful, it had to run to propellant depletion instead of a timed cutoff. The added stress of this operation apparently resulted in a failure of either the gas generator or turbopump, as the vernier solo phase ended prematurely. Missile M-6&#x27;s second stage failed to start when an electrical relay malfunctioned and reset the ignition timer.

With attention shifting to the Titan II, there were only six Titan I flights during 1962, with one failure, when Missile SM-4 (21 January) experienced an electrical short in the second stage hydraulic actuator, which gimbaled hard left at T+98 seconds. Staging was performed successfully, but the second stage engine failed to start.

Twelve more Titan Is were flown in 1963–65, with the finale being Missile SM-33, flown on 5 March 1965. The only total failure in this last stretch of flights was when Missile V-4 (1 May 1963) suffered a stuck gas generator valve and loss of engine thrust at liftoff. The Titan fell over and exploded on impact with the ground.

Although most of the Titan I&#x27;s teething problems were worked out by 1961, the missile was already eclipsed not only by the Atlas, but by its own design successor, the Titan II, a bigger, more powerful ICBM with storable hypergolic propellants. The launch pads at Cape Canaveral were quickly converted for the new vehicle. Vandenberg Launch Complex 395 continued to provide for operational test launches. The last Titan I launch was from LC 395A silo A-2 in March 1965. After a brief period as an operational ICBM, it was retired from service in 1965 when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara made the decision to phase out all first generation cryogenically fueled missiles in favor of newer hypergolic and solid-fueled models. While decommissioned Atlas (and later Titan II) missiles were recycled and utilized for space launches, the Titan I inventory were stored and eventually scrapped.

==Characteristics==
Produced by the Glenn L. Martin Company (which became &quot;The Martin Company&quot; in 1957), Titan I was a two-stage, liquid-fueled ballistic missile with an effective range of 6,101 nautical miles (11,300 km). The first stage delivered 300,000 pounds (1,330 kN) of thrust, the second stage 80,000 pounds (356 kN). The fact that Titan I, like Atlas, burned Rocket Propellant 1 (RP-1) and liquid oxygen (LOX) meant that the oxidizer had to be loaded onto the missile just before launch from an underground storage tank, and the missile raised above ground on the enormous elevator system, exposing the missile for some time before launch. The complexity of the system combined with its relatively slow reaction time – fifteen minutes to load, followed by the time required to raise and launch the first missile. Following the launch of the first missile the other two could reportedly be fired at -minute intervals. Titan I utilized radio-inertial command guidance. The inertial guidance system originally intended for the missile was instead eventually deployed in the Atlas E and F missiles. Less than a year later the Air Force considered deploying the Titan I with an all-inertial guidance system but that change never occurred. (The Atlas series was intended to be the first generation of American ICBMs and Titan II (as opposed to Titan I) was to be the second generation deployed). The Titan 1 was controlled by an autopilot which was informed of the missile&#x27;s attitude by a rate gyro assembly consisting of 3 gyroscopes. During the first minute or two of the flight a pitch programmer put the missile on the correct path. From that point the AN/GRW-5 guidance radar tracked a transmitter on the missile. The guidance radar fed missile position data to the AN/GSK-1 (Univac Athena) missile guidance computer in the Launch Control Center. The guidance computer used the tracking data to generate instructions which were encoded and transmitted to the missile by the guidance radar. Guidance input/output between the guidance radar and guidance computer occurred 10 times a second. Guidance commands continued for the stage 1 burn, the stage 2 burn and the vernier burn ensuring the missile was on the correct trajectory and terminating the vernier burn at the desired velocity. The last thing the guidance system did was to determine if the missile was on the right trajectory and pre-arm the warhead which then separated from the second stage. In case of the failure of the guidance system at one site, the guidance system at another site could be used to guide the missiles of the site with the failure.

Titan I also was the first true multi-stage (two or more stages) design. The Atlas missile had all three of its main rocket engines ignited at launch (two were jettisoned during flight) due to concerns about igniting rocket engines at high altitude and maintaining combustion stability. Martin, in part, was selected as the contractor because it had &quot;recognized the &#x27;magnitude of the altitude start problem&#x27; for the second stage and had a good suggestion for solving it.&quot; Titan I&#x27;s second-stage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude, after separation from the first stage booster. The first stage, besides including heavy fuel tanks and engines, also had launch interface equipment and the launch pad thrust ring with it. When the first stage had finished consuming its propellant, it dropped away, thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle. Titan I&#x27;s ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage meant that Titan I had a much greater total range (and a greater range per pound of second-stage fuel) than Atlas, even if the total fuel load of Atlas had been greater. As North American Aviation&#x27;s Rocketdyne Division was the only manufacturer of large liquid propellent rocket engines the Air Force Western Development Division decided to develop a second source for them. Aerojet-General was selected to design and manufacture the engines for the Titan. Aerojet produced the LR87-AJ-3 (booster) and LR91-AJ-3 (sustainer). George P. Sutton wrote &quot;Aerojet&#x27;s most successful set of large LPRE was that for the booster and sustainer stages of the versions of the Titan vehicle&quot;.

The warhead of the Titan I was an AVCO Mk 4 re-entry vehicle containing a W38 thermonuclear warhead with a yield of 3.75 megatons which was fuzed for either air burst or contact burst. The Mk 4 RV also deployed penetration aids in the form of mylar balloons which replicated the radar signature of the Mk 4 RV.

=== Athena guidance computer ===
The UNIVAC Athena computer calculated ground commands to transmit to the Titan missile as part of Western Electric&#x27;s missile guidance system. The Athena was the &quot;first transistorized digital computer to be produced in numbers.&quot; It consisted of ten cabinets plus console on a 13.5 by 20 foot (4.1 by 6 m) floor plan. It used radar tracking of the missile to compute Titan flight data to the necessary burn-out point to start a ballistic trajectory toward the target. On-board Titan attitude control rolled the missile to maintain the missile antenna aligned to the ground antenna. Computer commands were transmitted to the missile from a ground transmitter a &quot;quarter mile out&quot; (). Completed in 1957, the Athena weighed .

The Athena computer used a Harvard architecture design with separate data and instruction memories by Seymour Cray at Sperry Rand Corporation and cost about $1,800,000.

Used with the computer were the:
*AN/GSK-1 Computer Set Console (OA-2654)
*Friden, Inc. terminal with paper tape equipment
*&quot;massive motor-generator set with 440 volt 3 phase AC input [that] weighed over 2 tons&quot; at remote locations
*input from one of two large AN/GRW-5 Western Electric radars in silos each with &quot;20 foot (6 m) tall antenna&quot; raised prior to launch and locked to the raised Titan&#x27;s &quot;missileborne antenna&quot;.

The &quot;battleshort&quot; mode (&quot;melt-before-fail&quot;) prevented fail-safe circuits such as fuses from deactivating the machine &quot;e.g.&quot;, during a missile launch. The last Athena-controlled launch was a Thor-Agena missile launched in 1972 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the last of over 400 missile flights using the Athena.

==Service history==
The production of operational missiles began during the final stages of the flight test program. An operational specification SM-2 missile was launched from Vandenberg AFB LC-395-A3 on 21 January 1962, with the M7 missile launched on the last development flight from Cape Canaveral&#x27;s LC-19 on 29 January 1962. There were 59 XSM-68 Titan Is manufactured I in 7 developmental lots. One hundred and one SM-68 Titan I missiles were produced to equip six squadrons of nine missiles each across Western America. Fifty-four missiles were in silos in total, with one missile as a spare on standby at each squadron, bringing to 60 in service at any one time.
Titan was originally planned for a 1 X 10 (one control center with 10 launchers) &quot;soft&quot; site. In mid-1958 it was decided that the American Bosh Arma all-inertial guidance system designed for Titan would, because production was insufficient, be assigned to Atlas and the Titan would switch to radio-inertial guidance. The decision was made to deploy Titan squadrons in a &quot;hardened&quot; 3 X 3 (three sites with one control center and three silos each) to reduce the number of guidance systems required. (Radio-inertial guided Atlas D squadrons were similarly sited).

Although Titan I&#x27;s two stages gave it true intercontinental range and foreshadowed future multistage rockets, its propellants were dangerous and hard to handle. Cryogenic liquid oxygen oxidizer had to be pumped aboard the missile just before launch, and complex equipment was required to store and move this liquid.
In its brief career, a total of six USAF squadrons were equipped with the Titan I missile. Each squadron was deployed in a 3x3 configuration, which meant each squadron controlled a total of nine missiles divided among three launch sites, with the six operational units spread across the western United States in five states: Colorado (with two squadrons, both east of Denver), Idaho, California, Washington, and South Dakota. Each missile complex had three Titan I ICBM missiles ready to launch at any given time.

===Silos===
Weapon System 107A-2 was a weapon system. It encompassed all of the equipment and even the bases for the Titan I strategic missile. The Titan I was first American ICBM designed to be based in underground silos, and it gave USAF managers, contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast complexes containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival. The complexes were composed of an entry portal, control center, powerhouse, terminal room, two antenna silos for the ATHENA guidance radar antennas, and three launchers each composed of: three equipment terminals, three propellant terminals, and three missile silos. All connected by an extensive network of tunnels. Both antenna terminals and all three launchers were isolated with double door blast locks the doors of which could not be open at the same time. This was to ensure that if there was an explosion in a missile launcher or the site was under attack, only the exposed antenna and/or missile silo would be damaged.

The launch crew was composed of a missile combat crew commander, missile launch officer (MLO), guidance electronics officer (GEO), ballistic missile analyst technician (BMAT), and two electrical power production technicians (EPPT). There were also a cook and two Air Police. During normal duty hours there was a site commander, site maintenance officer, site chief, job controller/expediter, tool crib operator, power house chief, three pad chiefs, three assistant pad chiefs, another cook and more air police. There could be a number of electricians, plumbers, power production technicians, air conditioning technicians, and other specialist when maintenance was being performed.

These early complexes while safe from a nearby nuclear detonation, however, had certain drawbacks. First, the missiles took about 15 minutes to fuel, and then, one at a time, had to be lifted to the surface on elevators for launching and guidance, which slowed their reaction time. Rapid launching was crucial to avoid possible destruction by incoming missiles. Even though Titan complexes were designed to withstand nearby nuclear blasts antenna and missile extended for launch and guidance were quite susceptible to even a relatively distant miss. The missiles sites of a squadron were placed at least 17 (usually 20 to 30) miles apart so that a single nuclear weapon could not take out two sites. The sites also had to be close enough that if a site&#x27;s guidance system failed it could &quot;handover&quot; its missiles to another site of the squadron.

The distance between the antenna silos and the most distant missile silo was between 1,000 and . These were by far the most complex, extensive and expensive missile launch facilities ever deployed by the USAF. Launching a missile required fueling it in its silo, and then raising the launcher and missile out of the silo on an elevator. Before each launch, the guidance radar, which was periodically calibrated by acquiring a special target at a precisely known range and bearing, had to acquire a radio on the missile (missile guidance set AN/DRW-18, AN/DRW-19, AN/DRW-20, AN/DRW-21, or AN/DRW-22). When the missile was launched, the guidance radar tracked the missile and supplied precise velocity range and azimuth data to the guidance computer, which then generated guidance corrections that were transmitted to the missile. Because of this, the complex could only launch and track one missile at a time, although another could be elevated while the first was being guided.

===Retirement===
When the storable-fueled Titan II and the solid-fueled Minuteman I were deployed in 1963, the Titan I and Atlas missiles became obsolete. They were retired from service as ICBMs in early 1965.

The final launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) occurred on 5 March 1965. At that time, the disposition of the 101 total production missiles was as follows:
*17 were test launched from VAFB (September 1961 – March 1965)
*one was destroyed in Beale AFB Site 851-C1 silo explosion 24 May 1962
*54 were deployed in silos on 20 January 1965
*29 were in storage at SBAMA 
(three at VAFB, one at each of five bases, one at Lowry, and 20 in storage at SBAMA elsewhere)

The 83 surplus missiles remained in inventory at Mira Loma AFS. It did not make economic sense to refurbish them as SM-65 Atlas missiles with similar payload capacities had already been converted to satellite launchers. About 33 were distributed to museums, parks and schools as static displays (see list below). The remaining 50 missiles were scrapped at Mira Loma AFS near San Bernardino, CA; the last was broken up in 1972, in accordance with the SALT-I Treaty of 1 February 1972.

By November 1965 the Air Force Logistics Command had determined that the cost of modifying the widely dispersed sites to support other ballistic missiles was prohibitive, and attempts were made to find new uses. By Spring 1966 a number of possible uses and users had been identified. By 6 May 1966 the Air Force wanted to retain 5 Titan sites and the General Services Administration had earmarked 1 for possible use. The USAF removed equipment it had uses for, the rest was offered to other government agencies. Eventually no sites were retained and all were salvaged. The chosen method was the Service and Salvage contract, which required the contractor to remove the equipment the government wanted before proceeding with scrapping. This accounts for the varied degree of salvage at the sites today. Most are sealed today, with one in Colorado that is easily entered but also very unsafe. One is open for tours.

The 26 ATHENA guidance computers, when declared surplus by the federal government, went to various United States universities. The one at Carnegie was used as an undergraduate project until 1971, when the former electrical engineering undergraduate students (Athena Systems Development Group) orchestrated its donation to the Smithsonian Institution. One remained in use at Vandenberg AFB until it guided a last Thor-Agena launch in May 1972. It had guided over 400 missiles.

On 6 September 1985 Strategic Defense Initiative (AKA &quot;Star Wars&quot; program), a scrapped Titan I Second Stage was used in a Missile Defense test. The MIRACL Near Infrared Laser, at White Sands Missile Range, NM was fired at a stationary Titan I second stage that was fixed to the ground. The second stage burst and was destroyed by the laser blast. The second stage was pressurized with nitrogen gas to 60-psi and did not contain any fuel or oxidizer. A follow-up test 6 days later was conducted on a scrapped Thor IRBM, its remnants reside at the SLC-10 Museum at Vandenberg AFB.

==Prospective manned flights==

The Titan I was considered for use as the first missile to put a man in space. Two of the firms responding to an Air Force &quot;Request for Proposal&quot; for &quot;Project 7969,&quot; an early USAF project to &quot;Put a Man in Space Soonest (MISS)&quot;. Two of the four firms which responded, Martin and Avco, proposed using Titan I as the booster.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1974 was the 19th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 6 April 1974 in the Dome in Brighton, United Kingdom. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and presented by Katie Boyle, this was the fifth time that the contest was staged in the United Kingdom.

Although had won the with the song &quot;&quot; by Anne-Marie David, making (CLT) the presumptive host for 1974, the broadcaster opted not to organise the event as it had staged the contest in 1973, following &#x27;s win in . As had placed second the previous year (TVE) was approached, however the Spanish broadcaster also declined the opportunity to stage the contest. The Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA), and the British broadcasters the BBC and ITV, all subsequently made bids to stage the contest, with the BBC ultimately winning out. This was the fourth time that the BBC had staged the contest after another broadcaster declined the opportunity, having done so previously in , , and 1972.

Entries representing eighteen countries were submitted for the contest, with making its first appearance. However, ultimately did not participate as the contest coincided with the death of French president Georges Pompidou, and with a national day of mourning scheduled for the date of the contest the French broadcaster, (ORTF), deemed participating in the event to be inappropriate. The voting system used between and 1973 was scrapped, and was replaced by the system last used in , with ten people in each country awarding one vote to their favourite song.

The winner was , with the song &quot;Waterloo&quot;, composed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, written by Stig Anderson and performed by ABBA. and the placed second and third respectively, followed by a three-way tie for fourth place between Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. It was Sweden&#x27;s first contest win. After previous success within European markets with &quot;Ring Ring&quot;, with which ABBA had attempted to represent , &quot;Waterloo&quot; gave the group their first global hit, and their Eurovision win was a launching point for ABBA to become one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists. Olivia Newton-John, who represented the United Kingdom at this event, would also go on to achieve worldwide success in the years following the contest.

== Location ==

The 1974 contest was held in Brighton, United Kingdom. It was the fifth time that the United Kingdom had hosted the contest, having previously done so in , , , and . The selected venue was the Dome, completed in 1805 and originally built for the Prince Regent as stables and a riding school for his personal use. Sold by Queen Victoria in 1850, the stables were converted into a concert hall and assembly rooms in 1867, and the riding school into a market for corn merchants in 1868. The concert hall could normally seat up to 2,102 people, but for the contest some seating was removed for the commentator booths and technical equipment, leaving space for an audience of just over 1,000 people.

Among the other venues considered to stage the event by the BBC were the Royal Opera House and Royal Albert Hall in London, the latter of which had previously staged the 1968 contest. Both venues proved to be unavailable however, with the broadcaster then looking outside of the capital for potential venues. The Dome was then ultimately selected, and this choice was announced publicly by the BBC and EBU in July 1973.

=== Host selection ===
The was won by , represented by (CLT), with the song &quot;Tu te reconnaîtras&quot; performed by Anne-Marie David, which according to Eurovision tradition made CLT the presumptive host of the 1974 contest. The broadcaster had staged the event on three previous occasions, in , , and 1973, each time in Luxembourg City. As CLT had hosted the event the previous year, it declined the opportunity to stage the event for a second consecutive year due to the financial strain such an undertaking would entail. , which had come second in 1973, was also considered as a potential host for the event, however (TVE) also turned down the opportunity to stage the 1974 contest; TVE had previously hosted the event in .

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) originally asked the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), as the participating broadcaster which came third the previous year, not to make an offer at this initial stage in order to determine if other participating broadcasters were willing to stage the event. Of the four previous events held by the BBC three of these had been staged in place of the previous year&#x27;s winning broadcaster, specifically the 1960, 1963, and 1972 events. Two offers were subsequently made, from the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and from the BBC&#x27;s commercial rival ITV. Concerns were raised about the prospect of hosting the event in Israel; they had just joined the contest in 1973 and it was felt some countries would not be prepared to accept an Israeli-held contest. Israel was also some distance geographically from the core of Western European nations which participated in the event at this time, and IBA still lagged behind many European broadcasters from a technological perspective. A successful ITV bid would have effectively barred the BBC from participating, as only one entry from a given country can participate in the event, resulting in the BBC submitting a counter-offer which the EBU accepted on 7 June 1973.

== Participating countries ==


Broadcasters from a total of eighteen countries submitted entries to compete in this edition of the contest, comprising all seventeen countries which had participated in 1973, and , which was making its first appearance in the contest. Turkish broadcaster, the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), had also expressed an interest in competing but it had been too late in submitting its request to the EBU and was subsequently informed that, as the scoreboard with space for eighteen countries had already been constructed, its planned entry would not have been possible. Ultimately, however, only seventeen participating entries were performed at the contest, as French broadcaster, (ORTF), made the decision to withdraw from the event due to the death of French president Georges Pompidou on 2 April. With the state memorial service and a national day of mourning scheduled to be held on the same day as the contest, it was deemed by ORTF that competing in and broadcasting the contest would be inappropriate. France would have been represented by the song &quot;&quot;, written by Christine Fontaine and to have been performed by Dani, with Jean-Claude Petit scheduled to conduct the orchestra during the performance.

Among the participating artists were a number of acts which had competed in the Eurovision Song Contest in previous years: &#x27;s Gigliola Cinquetti had previously won the contest for with the song &quot;&quot;; Romuald, representing , had previously represented both and ; and &#x27;s Bendik Singers, supporting Anne-Karine Strøm at this event, had represented , with Strøm having also been a member of the group in that contest.


== Production and format ==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1974 was produced by the BBC. Bill Cotton served as executive producer, Michael Hurll served as producer and director, John Burrowes served as designer, and Ronnie Hazlehurst served as musical director, leading the BBC Concert Orchestra. A separate musical director could be appointed by each participating broadcaster to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those which did not appoint their own conductor. On behalf of the EBU, the event was overseen by Clifford Brown as scrutineer.

Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration. As with the previous year&#x27;s event, artists were able to perform in any language, and not necessarily that of the country they represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

Rehearsals in the contest venue began on Tuesday 2 April, involving technical rehearsals with the production team, the orchestra, and tests of the voting system and scoreboard. This was followed by rehearsals with the competing acts over subsequent days. The first rehearsals for all countries were held over two days on 3 and 4 April, with each participating act having a 50-minute slot on stage to perform through their entry with the orchestra without their stage costumes. A second round of rehearsals, this time in costume, was held for all acts on 5 April, with each country given 20 minutes on stage, followed that evening by a complete run-through of the whole show, including dummy voting. Further technical rehearsals were held on the morning of 6 April, and a second full dress rehearsal was held that afternoon; this rehearsal was also recorded for use as a back-up in case technical failure meant the contest could not go ahead as planned.

Security in Brighton was tight in the lead-up to, and during, the contest, due to the threat of actions by Irish republican militants. There was an increased police presence, and tanks could be seen in the streets of Brighton during the week of the contest. The contest presenter Katie Boyle also recalled being ferried in bulletproof coaches between the hotel and the contest venue, each time taking a different route.

=== Voting procedure ===

Due in part to the closeness of the voting in the previous year&#x27;s contest, a new voting system was planned to be introduced for this event, which incorporated elements from the two previous voting systems used in the contest: each participating broadcaster would assemble a jury comprising ten members, which would be based in their own country, with each member awarding between one and five votes for each song, with no abstentions allowed and without the option to vote for their own country&#x27;s entry. This would have resulted in each country potentially awarding a maximum of 50 votes and a minimum of 10 votes to any other country&#x27;s song; with eighteen planned participating countries, this would have meant that the highest possible score any country could have received was 850, and the lowest possible score was 170. In case of a tie between two or more countries for first place, these acts would have performed again and each country not involved in the tie would have had one vote each to determine the winner. A lottery element to the voting, in order to add greater suspense, was also devised: the order of the voting would have been determined on stage during the voting segment, with cards being drawn at random to decide the order in which countries would vote.

During rehearsals however, it quickly became apparent to the organisers that they had misjudged how long it would take to conduct this new voting system, as well as mounting concerns that any issues with totalling the scores live could exacerbate the problems. Although a computerised system to calculate each country&#x27;s total had been investigated, this was rejected for cost reasons. Ultimately the contest&#x27;s executive producer Bill Cotton took the unilateral decision to abandon the proposed voting system and, given the jury structure of ten people had already been established and jury members had most likely already been recruited by the broadcasters, determined that the only alternative was to revert to the scoring system last used in : each of the ten jury members had one vote to award to their favourite song. The lottery aspect of the voting system was, however, retained, although due to timing and sound quality reasons this draw was held before the contest by the EBU&#x27;s scrutineer Clifford Brown.

== Contest overview ==
The contest was held on 6 April 1974, beginning at 21:30 (BST) and lasting 1 hour and 49 minutes. The contest was presented by the British television presenter and actress Katie Boyle, who had previously presented the contest in 1960, 1963 and 1968. Having hosted the contest four times, Boyle holds the record for most contest appearances as a presenter . Following the confirmation of the eighteen planned participating countries, the draw to determine the running order (R/O) of the contest was held on 5 December 1973; prior to its withdrawal, France was scheduled to perform in fourteenth position, between the entries from and .

The interval act was a pre-recorded video montage featuring the Wombles, a novelty pop band based on the children&#x27;s characters of the same name, in various locations across Brighton. The medallions awarded to the winning songwriters were presented by the Director-General of the BBC and the President of the EBU, Charles Curran.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;Waterloo&quot;, composed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, written by Stig Anderson and performed by ABBA. It was Sweden&#x27;s first contest win.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1974 contest are listed below.
* Brendan Balfe
* Sophie Hecquet
* Sven Lindahl
* Colin Ward-Lewis
* Helga Vlahović

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in a predetermined order chosen at random, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s votes in English or French in performance order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below, with voting countries listed in the order in which they presented their votes.

== Broadcasts ==

Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

In addition to the participating nations, which, with the exception of Italy, all broadcast the contest live on television, the contest was also reportedly aired, live or deferred, by broadcasters in Algeria, Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Japan, Jordan, Iceland, Morocco, Poland, South Korea, the Soviet Union and Tunisia. In addition to television coverage, participating broadcasters in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom were also reported to have relayed the contest via radio. Although the script for the contest&#x27;s opening remarks by Katie Boyle suggested that around 500 million viewers were expected to watch and listen to the contest, the EBU later put the actual estimated figure for the total audience at 231 million.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.



== Legacy ==
The 1974 contest has retrospectively gained notability for a number of aspects, particularly due to the success of some of the competing acts, as well as political developments within Europe that have indirect links to this edition of the event. Two competing artists at this year&#x27;s event, in particular, went on to sustained worldwide success after the contest: Sweden&#x27;s ABBA and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Olivia Newton-John.

The individual members of ABBA had made previous attempts to reach Eurovision, participating in Sweden&#x27;s national selection, , several times, both as a group and individually. Anni-Frid Lyngstad participated in Melodifestivalen 1969, placing fourth with the song &quot;, while Benny Andersson competed in the same edition as a songwriter, placing second with the song &quot; performed by Jan Malmsjö. Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus subsequently competed as a songwriting partnership in 1972, penning the Lena Andersson song &quot;&quot;, which placed third. Following the formation of ABBA, the group (performing under the name &quot;Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid&quot;) competed in Melodifestivalen 1973 with the song &quot;Ring Ring&quot;, which ultimately placed third. While &quot;Ring Ring&quot; was popular within European markets, wider success for the group, particularly in English-speaking markets, proved elusive, and the group saw Eurovision as a launchpad for exposure among these markets, resulting in a further attempt to get to the contest in 1974. Although &quot;Waterloo&quot; had been written with Eurovision in mind, the group also considered submitting the song &quot;&quot; to Swedish broadcaster (SR), as the latter song was felt to be more in-line with the songs that had done well in Eurovision in previous years. Ultimately, however, &quot;Waterloo&quot; was chosen, given it was more likely to be unlike other entries submitted, and therefore would stand out more; &quot;&quot; was also mainly sung only by Agnetha Fältskog, whereas with &quot;Waterloo&quot; all four members of the group could give their vocals to the song.

Following the group&#x27;s win, &quot;Waterloo&quot; went on to top the charts in multiple European countries, including the UK singles chart, as well as reaching the top ten in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Long-term success for the group, however, did not materialise until the release of &quot;SOS&quot; in 1975, which allowed the group to shrug off a perception of being &quot;one-hit wonders&quot; and led to a string of hits through the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s, which catapulted the foursome to become one of the best-selling music groups of all time. ABBA&#x27;s international success within the global music scene, starting from their Eurovision win, additionally led to a large growth in the accessibility of Swedish pop music worldwide, with Sweden often considered a superpower in the realm of music export and claims made by the 2000s of being the third-largest exporter of music globally, behind only the United States and the United Kingdom.

Olivia Newton-John was in the early stages of her career when she was approached by the BBC to represent the United Kingdom at Eurovision; she had achieved previous success in the charts in both the UK and US, particularly with country pop songs, and had been a frequent guest on the &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard&quot; show, fronted by two-time Eurovision entrant for the United Kingdom Cliff Richard. Newton-John had performed six songs at that year&#x27;s &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; contest, with &quot;Long Live Love&quot; being chosen by the viewing public through postcard voting; although it was considered a favourite to win the contest, she later told the press after placing fourth that she felt the wrong song had been chosen and that she would have preferred to have performed a ballad. Newton-John subsequently achieved considerable success in the United States and global recognition after starring in the musical films &quot;Grease&quot; (1978) and &quot;Xanadu&quot; (1980).

Following the contest, the Portuguese entry, &quot; by Paulo de Carvalho, played a large part in the launching of the Carnation Revolution, which ultimately led to the overthrow of the authoritarian regime, setting Portugal along a path towards the reestablishment of democracy and ending the country&#x27;s war with its African colonies. The broadcast of the song on radio in the evening of 24 April 1974 was used as a signal to alert rebelling officers in the Portuguese army to begin the coup, which kicked off overnight following the playing of another song, &quot; by José Afonso, in the early hours of 25 April.

The Italian broadcaster, (RAI), did not air the contest for two months due to the content of its own entry. The contest coincided with the campaigning period for a referendum on abolishing divorce within the country, which was held a month after the contest, and there were fears that the , &quot;&quot; (&quot;Yes&quot;) by Gigliola Cinquetti, could have been seen as an attempt to sway the result of the vote. The contest was, however, available to watch in parts of northern Italy where transmissions of Swiss and Yugoslav Italian-language television were accessible. The contest was eventually broadcast on RAI on 6 June 1974, a month after the referendum.

&quot;Waterloo&quot; was subsequently nominated in 2005 to compete in &quot;&quot;, a special broadcast to determine the contest&#x27;s most popular entry of its first 50 years as part of the contest&#x27;s anniversary celebrations. One of 14 entries chosen to compete, &quot;Waterloo&quot; was ultimately declared the winner of the competition over two rounds of jury and public voting.

<doc id="192551" wikidata="Q1187870" url="?curid=192551" title="USS Illinois (BB-65)">
<text>USS &quot;Illinois&quot; (BB-65) was the fifth fast battleship that was laid down for the United States Navy during World War II in the 1940s, although she would not be completed. The Navy had initially planned on building four of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s and then developing a new, more powerful ship for what was to be BB-65. The pressing need for more warships at the outbreak of World War II in Europe led the Navy to conclude that new designs would have to be placed on hold to allow the shipbuilding industry to standardize on a small number of designs. As a result, BB-65 was ordered to the &quot;Iowa&quot; design in 1940. &quot;Illinois&quot; was laid down in December 1942, but work was given a low priority, and was still under construction at the end of World War II. She was canceled in August 1945, but her hull remained as a parts hulk until she was broken up in 1958.

== Background ==

The of fast battleships was designed in the late 1930s in response to the US Navy&#x27;s expectations for a future war with the Empire of Japan. American officers preferred comparatively slow but heavily armed and armored battleships, but Navy planners determined that such a fleet would have difficulty in bringing the faster Japanese fleet to battle, particularly the s and the aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet. Design studies prepared during the development of the earlier and es demonstrated the difficulty in resolving the desires of fleet officers with those of the planning staff in the displacement limits imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty system, which had governed capital ship construction since 1923. An escalator clause in the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936 that allowed an increase from to in the event that any member nation refused to sign the treaty, which Japan refused to do.

The passage of the Second Vinson Act in 1938 cleared the way for construction of the four &quot;South Dakota&quot;–class battleships and the first two &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships ( and ) for the United States Navy. Two more vessels, and , were ordered in June 1940, and were to have been the final members of the &quot;Iowa&quot; class. The Navy initially planned to develop a new, more powerful design for the next battleship, designated &quot;BB-65&quot;, which would eventually become the . But the need to adopt industrial mobilization as the threat of war loomed forced the Navy to place new designs on hold, and as a result, BB-65 and a second ship were ordered to the &quot;Iowa&quot; design. The last battleships to be built by the United States, the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships were also the US Navy&#x27;s largest and fastest vessels of the type.

==Design==
&quot;Illinois&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement as completed would have amounted to and increased to at full combat load. &quot;Illinois&quot; differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all-welded construction, which would have saved weight due to increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull used on the four completed &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships.

The ship was to have been powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a planned cruising range of at a speed of . Her projected crew numbered 117 officers and 1,804 enlisted men.

The ship was to have been armed with a main battery of nine /50 caliber Mark 7 guns guns in three triple-gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward, with the third aft. The planned secondary battery consisted of twenty /38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets clustered amidships, five turrets on either side. As designed, the ship was to be equipped with an anti-aircraft battery of eighty guns and forty-nine auto-cannon.

The main armor belt was thick, while the main armor deck was thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and they were mounted atop barbettes that were protected with of armored steel. The conning tower had thick sides. Like the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships from &quot;Missouri&quot; onward, the traverse bulkhead armor was increased from the original to in order to better protect against fire from frontal sectors. Tests with caissons in 1943 led to improvements for the torpedo defense system that increased its resilience to underwater damage by around twenty percent compared to the first four &quot;Iowa&quot;s.

== Construction and cancellation ==
When BB-65 was redesignated an &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ship, she was assigned the name &quot;Illinois&quot; and reconfigured to adhere to the fast battleship designs drawn up in 1938, by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair. Her funding was authorized via the passage of the Two-Ocean Navy Act by the U.S. Congress on 19 July 1940, and she would now become the fifth &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ship built for the U.S. Navy. Her contract was assigned on 9 September 1940, the same date as &quot;Kentucky&quot;. Funding for the battleship was provided in part by proceeds from the auction of &quot;King Neptune&quot;, a Hereford swine presented across the state of Illinois as a fundraiser, ultimately helping to raise $19 million in war bonds.

&quot;Illinois&quot;″s construction was put on hold in 1942, after the Battles of the Coral Sea and Midway, while the Bureau of Ships considered an aircraft carrier conversion proposal for &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot;. As proposed, the converted &quot;Illinois&quot; flight deck would have been long by wide, with an armament identical to the carriers of the &#x27;s four twin 5-inch gun mounts and four more 5-inch guns in single mounts, along with six 40 mm quadruple mounts. The conversion was abandoned after the design team decided that the converted carriers would carry fewer aircraft than the &quot;Essex&quot;-class, that more &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers could be built in the same amount of time to convert the battleships, and that the project would be significantly more expensive than building new &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers. Instead, &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot; were to be completed as battleships, but their construction was given very low priority.

&quot;Illinois&quot;″s keel was laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, on 6 December 1942; her projected completion date was 1 May 1945. Ultimately, the ship was canceled on 11 August 1945, when she was about 22 per cent complete. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 August 1945. Her incomplete hulk initially was retained on the belief that it could be used as a target in nuclear weapons tests. However, the $30 million it would cost to complete the ship enough to be able to launch her proved too great and the plan was abandoned. She remained in the dockyard until September 1958, when she was broken up on the slipway.

The ship&#x27;s bell, inscribed &quot;USS Illinois 1946&quot;, is now at Memorial Stadium at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The bell is on loan from the Naval History and Heritage Command (Accession #70-399-A), Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC, to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) at the university. The bell is traditionally rung by NROTC members when the university football team scores a touchdown or goal.

<text>, formerly known as , was a Japanese statesman, samurai and &quot;shishi&quot; who is considered one of the three great nobles who led the Meiji Restoration.

==Early life==
Born Wada Kogorō on August 11, 1833 in Hagi, Chōshū Domain (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture) as the son of a samurai physician and his second wife . In 1840, due to his brother-in-law already being the head of the Wada family, he was later adopted into the Katsura family at age seven and was known as .

The Katsura family&#x27;s stipend was originally 150 &quot;koku&quot;, but due to the late nature of his adoption which took place as his adoptive father was already on his deathbed, who died ten days later, it was reduced to 90 &quot;koku&quot;. Katsura Kogorō thus became the head of the Katsura family. A year later in 1841, his adoptive mother also died, months later he was returned to his old home. In 1848, he lost his mother and elder half-sister Yaeko to illnesses.

Katsura was educated at Meirinkan, in which he later became increasingly unhappy with and defied his father in order to be educated at Shōka Sonjuku in 1849, the academy of Yoshida Shōin, from whom he adopted the philosophy of Imperial loyalism. In 1851, his father had died.

In 1852, Katsura went to Edo (present-day Tokyo) to study swordsmanship, established ties with radical &quot;samurai&quot; from the Mito Domain (present-day Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture), learned artillery techniques with Egawa Tarōzaemon, and (after observing the construction of foreign ships in Nagasaki and Shimoda), returned to Chōshū to supervise the construction of the domain&#x27;s first western-style warship.

==Overthrow of the Tokugawa==
After 1858, Katsura Kogorō was based at the domain&#x27;s Edo residence, where he served as a liaison between the domain bureaucracy and radical elements among the young, lower-echelon Chōshū &quot;samurai&quot; who supported the &quot;Sonnō jōi&quot; movement. Coming under suspicion by the shogunate for his ties with Mito loyalists after the attempted assassination of Andō Nobumasa, he was transferred to Kyōto. However, while in Kyōto, he was unable to prevent the 30 September 1863 coup d&#x27;état by the forces of the Aizu and Satsuma domains, who drove the Chōshū forces out of the city.

===Ikedaya incident===

According to his personal diary regarding the Ikedaya incident, Katsura was at the loyalist meeting with the &quot;Ishin Shishi&quot; at the Ikedaya inn in the evening on July 8, 1864, he claimed that they had only met to discuss how to rescue Furutaka Shuntaro from the Shinsengumi. Katsura later left the inn earlier, before the attack by the Shinsengumi troops on that night.

However, there were rumors varied that Katsura was tipped off by his geisha lover , that the Shinsengumi were coming for him and wisely chose not show up for the meeting, or that he climbed out the window of the upper floor of the inn during the attack by the Shinsengumi and escaped over the roofs.

He spent the next five days in hiding under Nijō Bridge along the Kamo River, posing as a beggar, his lover would bring him rice balls from the shop of the Chōshū merchant Imai Tarōemon and later aided in his escape.

===Kinmon incident===

Katsura was involved but not present in the Hamaguri Gate Rebellion on 20 August 1864, with the unsuccessful attempt to capture Emperor Kōmei by the Chōshū forces at Hamaguri Gate in order to restore the Imperial household to its position of political supremacy, the Chōshū forces clashed with Aizu and Satsuma forces who led the defense of the Imperial palace. During the attempt, the Chōshū rebels put Kyoto on fire, starting with the residence of the Takatsukasa family, and that of a Chōshū official.

The rebellion resulted in 28,000 houses being burnt down, with casualties of about 400 from the Chōshū forces, including his adopted son Katsuzaburō, and only 60 from Aizu and Satsuma forces, forcing Katsura into hiding again with his geisha lover. He would later use the name Niibori Matsusuke as an alias in 1865 to continue his work against the Tokugawa bakufu.

===Satchō Alliance===
After radical elements under Takasugi Shinsaku gained control of Chōshū politics, Katsura, under the new name was instrumental in establishing the Satchō Alliance with Saigō Takamori and Ōkubo Toshimichi through the mediation of Sakamoto Ryōma in 1866, which proved to be critical in the Boshin War and the subsequent Meiji Restoration. Around the same time, he adopted Shojirō, another nephew who was the second son of his younger sister, Kuruhara Haruko, as his heir.

==Meiji statesman==

Following the overthrow of the Tokugawa bakufu in 1868, Kido claimed a large role in the establishment of the new Meiji government. As a &quot;san&#x27;yo&quot; (Imperial Advisor) he helped draft the Five Charter Oath, and initiated policies of centralization and modernization. He helped direct the Abolition of the han system. In August 1868, he had his lover Ikumatsu adopted into a samurai family of Okabe Tomitarō, and later made her his wife. He was later renamed to in 1869.

On 23 December 1871, he accompanied the Iwakura Mission on its round-the-world voyage to America and Europe, and was especially interested in Western educational systems and politics. On his return to Japan on 13 September 1873, he would become a strong advocate of the establishment of constitutional government. Realizing that Japan was not in any position to challenge the Western powers in its present state, he also returned to Japan just in time to prevent an invasion of Korea (&quot;Seikanron&quot;).

Kido lost his dominant position in the Meiji oligarchy to Ōkubo Toshimichi, and resigned from government in protest of the Taiwan Expedition of 1874, which he had strenuously opposed.

Following the Osaka Conference of 1875, Kido agreed to return to the government, and became chairman of the Assembly of Prefectural Governors that the Ōsaka Conference had created. He was also responsible for the education of the young Emperor Meiji.

During the middle of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877, he died of Colorectal cancer that had been plaguing him for a long time, which consisted of a combination of some form of mental disease and physical exhaustion, years of excessive alcohol consumption as well as an illness assumed to be tuberculosis or beriberi. With his dim consciousness, Kido shook Okubo&#x27;s hand and said, &quot;Enough Saigo &quot; He is enshrined at Kyoto Ryozen Gokoku Shrine, where his tomb is located.

==Legacy==
His heir Shojirō, who had studied for ten years in England before returning to Japan in 1882, however died of illness on the ship during the return journey near Ceylon. Kuruhara Hikotarō, another Kido&#x27;s nephew and Shojirō&#x27;s eldest brother, succeeded him as the new heir of the Kido family on 18 November 1884 and was known as the Marquis Kido Takamasa.
Kido Takayoshi was enshrined as the Shinto deity of scholarship and the martial arts at the Kido Shrine in about 1886 at Kido Park, Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan.

His widow Matsuko survived him and died in 1887 at the age of 43.

Kido&#x27;s diary reveals an intense internal conflict between his loyalty to his home domain, Chōshū, and the greater interest of the country. He wrote often of having to fight rumors at home that he had betrayed his old friends; the idea of a nation was still relatively new in Japan and so the majority of samurai cared more for securing privileges for their own domain.

He was friends with the English Legation interpreter Ernest Satow. The two met many times from the Shimonoseki incident onwards.
Together with Saigō Takamori and Ōkubo Toshimichi, he was known as the Ishin-no-Sanketsu (維新の三傑), which means, roughly, &quot;Three Great Nobles of the Restoration&quot;. His younger sister&#x27;s grandson was Tokyo politician .

==Kido Takayoshi former residence in Hagi==
The house where Kido Takayoshi was born and where he lived for about 20 years before moving to Edo still exists in Hagi and is a memorial museum. Although he had been adopted into the Katsura family when he was seven years old, he continued to live in this family home. The former residence is located on a street called Edoya Yokocho, and is a two-story wooden building with a tiled roof. In the house there are hanging scrolls with examples of Japanese calligraphy Kido wrote as a child, with corrections in red ink by his teachers. Volunteer guides are stationed in the building. The building was designated a National Historic Site in 1934.

== In popular culture ==
Kido, referred to by his initial name Katsura Kogorō, was among the historical personalities present in the manga and anime &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; by Nobuhiro Watsuki, as well as its OVA adaptation &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: Trust &amp; Betrayal&quot;. While still portrayed as a ruthless radical leader of the Chōshū clan, he serves as a benevolent mentor of sorts to the young Himura Kenshin, who worked under him as the &quot;Hitokiri Battōsai.&quot; He nonetheless regrets having Kenshin do the dirty work for him after Kenshin&#x27;s affair with Yukishiro Tomoe (in &quot;Tsuiokuhen&quot;, he actively encouraged Tomoe to stand by Kenshin to serve as a calming influence), which ultimately boiled over into her conflicting loyalties to the shogunate agent and her emerging feelings for Kenshin. He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki in the OVA, and portrayed by Issey Takahashi in the 2021 live-action adaptation film &quot;Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning&quot;.

Japanese actor Ken Ishiguro portrayed him in the 2004 jdorama &quot;Shinsengumi!&quot; as the old time friend of the protagonist Kondo Isami and also the leader of the Chōshū han.

Japanese actor Shōsuke Tanihara portrayed him in the 2009 jdorama &quot;Ryōmaden&quot; as the leader of the Chōshū han.

He is also the basis for the character of Katsura Kotarou in the manga and anime &quot;Gin Tama&quot; by Hideaki Sorachi.

He also appears in the video game &quot;Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!&quot;, portrayed by the Yakuza character Shun Akiyama, and voiced by Kōichi Yamadera.

Katsura Kogorō has also a prominent supporting role in Team Ninjas 2024 Action-RPG Rise of the Rōnin and is one of the many popular personalities from the Bakumatsu-Period, that the player can get acquainted with.

<doc id="192559" wikidata="Q214964" url="?curid=192559" title="Gilles Binchois">
<text>Gilles de Bins dit Binchois (also Binchoys; – 20 September 1460) was a Franco-Flemish composer and singer of early Renaissance music. A central figure of the Burgundian School, Binchois is renowned a melodist and miniaturist; he generally avoided large scale works, and is most admired for his shorter secular chansons. He is generally ranked below his colleague Guillaume Du Fay and the English composer John Dunstaple, but together the three were the most celebrated composers of the early European Renaissance.

Binchois was born in Mons (modern-day Belgium) to an upper-class family from Binche. His youth is largely unknown, although early chorister training is likely; by late 1419 he had obtained a local organist post. By 1423 he was in Lille and probably a soldier under the Englishman William de la Pole, eventually in Paris and Hainaut. Sometime during the 1420s, Binchois settled in the culturally thriving court of Burgundy under Philip the Good, where he became a subdeacon and was awarded numerous prebends. He retired to Soignies in 1453 amid a substantial courtly pension, dying in 1460.

It is thought that considerably more of his sacred music survives than secular music, creating a &quot;paradoxical image&quot; of the composer. Reflecting on his style, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; comments that &quot;Binchois cultivated the gently subtle rhythm, the suavely graceful melody, and the smooth treatment of dissonance of his English contemporaries&quot;.

==Life==
===Early life===
The composer&#x27;s full name is Gilles de Bins dit Binchois, consisting of the byname &#x27;Gilles de Binche&#x27; (also spelled &#x27;Gilles de Bins&#x27;) and the &quot;dit&quot; name Binchois (also spelled &#x27;Binchoys&#x27;). Obituary records from St Vincent, Soignies name his parents as Johannes and Johanna de Binche, usually identified with Jean de Binch (?) and his wife Jeanne, née Paulouche (?). His parents were of the upper class in Mons and probably from the town of Binche; his father was a councillor to Duke William IV of Hainault and later Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut. The elder Binchois was also a councillor for the Ste Waudru church of Mons, and built a chapel for the St Germain church. Their son Gilles Binchois was probably born in Mons, then in the County of Hainaut, the same city in which the composer Orlande de Lassus would be born a century later. There is no documentary evidence that Binchois was born in the town of Binche, a few miles from Mons, as is sometimes assumed.

Nothing for certain is known about Binchois until 8 December 1419, when he is known to have been the organist at Ste Waudru in Mons. It is possible that Gilles Binchois received an early musical education near the court of Mons, and like other composers of his time, he probably trained as a chorister in his youth, perhaps at St Germain. An account from (1880) which refers to the chorister Jean de Binche at Cambrai Cathedral has often been misinterpreted as referring to Binchois. There is no evidence that Binchois was a chorister at Cambrai in his youth. As is known, he never received an academic degree of any kind.

Records from 28 July 1423 indicates that he soon moved to Lille. Around this time he may have been a soldier, as indicated by a line in the funeral motet &quot;Deploration for Binchois&quot;, composed in his memory by the composer Johannes Ockeghem. Binchois might have served under the Englishman William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who was in France for the Hundred Years&#x27; War; Binchois is assumed to have been in Paris, alongside the composer Estienne Grossin. This association is evidenced by a 1426 document which records that the Duke of Suffolk commissioned the otherwise unknown rondel &quot;Ainsi que a la foiz m’y souvient&quot; from a &#x27;Binchoiz&#x27;. At some point Binchois went with William to Hainaut.

===Burgundian court===
Sometime during the late 1420s Binchois joined the court chapel choir of Burgundy; the exact date is unknown due to chapel&#x27;s lost employment records from 1419 to 1436. A 1427 disposition from Guillaume Benoit which includes Binchois&#x27; name suggests he was there by then, though this is uncertain. He was certainly in the chapel when he wrote the motet &quot;Nove cantum melodie&quot;—one of his only datable compositions—on the 18th of January 1431, as it was for the baptism of Anthony, bastard of Burgundy; the motet&#x27;s text names Binchois alongside the composer Pierre Fontaine. The musicologist David Fallows notes that &quot;he must have been there some years earlier since the list of 1436 places him as fifth chaplain in order of seniority within the choir&quot;. The Burgundian court under Philip the Good was perhaps the most lively and prominent court of the area; its members compared it to that of Alexander The Great. The musicologist Reinhard Strohm commented that Philip&#x27;s court of &quot;eclectic and flamboyant culture typified the feudal aspirations of the age&quot;. This golden age was not from any specific innovations by Philip specifically, but his continued patronage after a long-line of monarchial support for the arts.

Among the residents of the court was the painter Jan van Eyck, who, according to the art historian Erwin Panofsky, may have portrayed Binchois in the &quot;Léal Souvenir&quot; portrait, though there is no widespread agreement for this. Binchois was associated with the leading composer of his day, Guillaume Du Fay. They likely met, alongside the poet Martin le Franc, during a meeting at Chambéry of the Burgundian and Savoy courts in February 1434. It was probably here that Le Franc wrote his famous &quot;Le champion des dames&quot; poem, which depicts the two composers and blind Burgundian vielle players. The only certain meeting of the composers was in March 1449, when Du Fay resided with Binchois in Mons for a convocation of canons. Aside from Du Fay, important composer contemporaries of the region included Hugo de Lantins and Arnold de Lantins.

The Burgundian chapel choir was unique in allowing its members to become clergy without being ordained as a priest; in 1437 Binchois became a subdeacon. Probably due to Philip&#x27;s favor, he held prebends for at least four churches until his death: St Donatian, Bruges (from 7 January 1430); Ste Waudru, Mons (from 17 May 1437); St Vincent, Soignies (from 1452); and St Pierre, Cassel (from 21 May 1459). He was also made honorary court secretary in 1437 by Philip, who paid for a now-lost work by him on 29 May 1438, &quot;Passions en nouvelle maniere&quot;. It is possible that Binchois had some experience in medicine, since he attended to a duchess&#x27;s toothache in July 1437, receiving 30 sous. The choir&#x27;s attendance records are fairly thorough, and indicate that Binchois did not travel much on his own.

===Final Soignies years===
He eventually retired in Soignies by February 1453, receiving a substantial pension until his death, presumably for his long years of exemplary service to the Burgundian court. In 1452 he became provost of the collegiate church of St Vincent. Around this time Soignies grew its reputation for musical excellence; Guillaume Malbecque and Johannes Regis were active there, while the contemporary writers Jacobus Lessabaeus and Lodovico Guicciardini praised the town&#x27;s musical standard. Binchois may have been involved in the well known 1454 Feast of the Pheasant in Lille, as the motet &quot;Lamentatio sanctae matris ecclesiae Constantinopolitanae&quot; was performed, which may be by Binchois, but is usually ascribed to Du Fay.

On 20 September 1460 Binchois died in Soignies; his will mentions otherwise unknown family members, including his brothers Andri de Binch and Ernoul de Binch. He was buried in St. Vincent&#x27;s collegiate church. Upon his death Ockeghem wrote a deploration, &quot;Mort, tu as navré de ton dart&quot;; its opening appears to quote an otherwise unknown chanson by Binchois. Fallows has suggested that Du Fay composed the rondeau &quot;En triumphant&quot; in 1460 for his colleague&#x27;s death, since it seemingly references two songs by Binchois.

==Music==

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; characterizes Binchois&#x27; musical style as emphasizing &quot;gently subtle rhythm, the suavely graceful melody, and the smooth treatment of dissonance [found in the music] of his English contemporaries&quot;. As a melodist, he is often considered among the finest of the 15th century; Fallows argues that in this regard, he had no contemporary equal. Binchois&#x27; composed exclusively vocal music; his compositions include 28 mass movements, 32 psalms, 28 smaller sacred works, 54 chansons, and a variety of motets. Most are written for three voices, although some have four.

Most commentators agree that Binchois was not a progressive composer. The musicologist Reinhard Strohm concludes that although he &quot;earned his enormous reputation in the one genre in which he excelled as a composer [...] this master of melody and courtly performer apparently does not explore the depths of the art&quot;. Binchois utilized a limited range of techniques, favoring older melodic styles that echoed the 12th-century &quot;amour courtois&quot; () tradition of the troubadours and &quot;trouvères&quot;. His genre preference was equally conservative, favoring small-scale works over more fashionable cyclic masses and &quot;cantus firmus&quot; masses based on secular tunes. This preference led to musicologist Anthony Pryer to describe him as a &quot;supreme miniaturist&quot;. Indeed only a single large-scale work of his survives, the incomplete isorhythmic motet &quot;Nove cantum melodie&quot; (1481).

Binchois&#x27; treatment of cadences was more forward-looking; he occasionally approached the dominant scale-degree and leading-tone with a tonal sensibilities of the later common practice period. His progressive use of dissonance has also incited much discussion—he often embraced moments of dissonant part writing, even when it was &quot;easily avoided&quot;. Joan A. Boucher also noted that Binchois&#x27; wide range use of the bass voice was unique for his time.

Like Du Fay, Binchois was deeply influenced by the &quot;contenance angloise&quot; style of John Dunstaple and Lionel Power, which uniquely emphasized the third and sixth intervals and often highlighted duets within larger textures. Although Binchois probably never visited England, the Burgundian court had good relations with the English, with whom they established both diplomatic and cultural links; the Renaissance scholar Gordon Campbell notes that Binchois was &quot;ideally placed to absorb and reflect styles from across the channel&quot;. The English influence was such that three settings of antiphons by Power and Dunstable, along with a motet by Standley, were long-misattributed to Binchois. Strohm cautions that this influence was not prevalent enough to consider any of Binchois&#x27; works to be English in style or imitating an English model: &quot;he followed his own, aural version of &quot;contenance angloise&quot;&quot;.

===Secular===
Binchois is best known for his lyric-driven secular French songs, known as chansons, which were widely transmitted and imitated by fellow composers. During Binchois&#x27; lifetime, the rondeau became the dominant chanson-type of the three &quot;formes fixes&quot;. This was reflected in Binchois&#x27; body of work: of his 54 chansons, the vast majority (47) are rondeaux and seven are ballades. His songs are almost exclusively in triple time, save for the rondeau &quot;Seule esgaree&quot; in duple meter. Other stylistic tropes include the use of under-third cadences (Landini cadences), the favoring of short phrases and material repetition. Pryer explains that &quot;these superficial repetitions serve to demonstrate Binchois&#x27; flexibility, since it is rare for two phrases to have exactly the same rhythmic or melodic contour, and consecutive phrases rarely end on the same pitch or note-value.&quot; His melodies value simplicity, economy of material and, outside of the codas, minimal rhythmic activity. The musicologist Hans-Otto Korth has noted a resemblance between the melodic character and simplicity of Binchois&#x27; music and that of folk music, emphasizing it is a similarity in effect, not necessarily an influence. Fallows highlights these sentiments in numerous works: the &quot;unforgettable grace&quot; of &quot;De plus en plus&quot;; &quot;restrained elegance&quot; of &quot;Mon cuer chante&quot;; and &quot;carefully balanced phrases&quot; of &quot;Adieu jusques je vous revoye&quot;. 

The lyrics Binchois set were often by prominent French poet contemporaries, such as Charles, Duke of Orléans, Alain Chartier and Christine de Pizan. He chiefly prioritized serious courtly subjects, unlike his contemporaries who wrote spoof songs and celebratory songs for May Day and New Year&#x27;s Day; the combinative chanson &quot;Filles a marier/Se tu t’en marias&quot;, which cautions against marriage, is an exception. Binchois&#x27; method of text setting was often unique from his peers; his melodies are generally independent of the poem&#x27;s rhyme scheme. Scholars note that his tendency to favor musical structure over poetic form has made their combination unpredictable in his works. This is a stark departure from the careful music-text balance of Guillaume Du Fay&#x27;s compositions. Fallows suggests that this approach is an attempt to counter the strict structural rules of the &quot;formes fixes&quot;, while Slavin describes this attitude as more medieval than Humanistic-Renaissance.

In addition to not prioritizing poetic structure, Binchois heavily emphasized musical symmetry. The musicologist Wolfgang Rehm was the first to note that numerous Binchois songs, particularly early works, are symmetrically constructed in their length and the location of their middle cadence. Rehm also observed that in five-line rondeaux, Binchois added a sixth non-texted musical line, so that the music remained symmetrical. In works such as the rondeau &quot;Amours et souvenir&quot;, abba poems are offset by an abab musical passage. As such, Binchois is stands out from other Renaissance composers in that &quot;poetic form of a song cannot always be deduced correctly from the music alone&quot;.

===Sacred===
Most of Binchois&#x27; sacred output is individual mass movements, alongside psalm and canticle settings (particularly magnificats) and a variety of smaller sacred works. No complete cyclic mass is extant and although scholars such as and Arthur Parris have attempted to combine movements into a complete work, Fallows considers these nowhere near the coherency of other Renaissance masses. Although a few pairs of movements are known, their unification comes from overarching stylistic similarities, not specific musical material. These mass movements are based around chant; unlike his contemporaries, the chant is used in a forward-looking manner: a starting point, not a strict foundation, allowing for more creative liberty. Conversely the overall mass movement structure is relatively conservative.

It is generally assumed that considerably more of Binchois&#x27; total sacred music survives than secular, creating a &quot;paradoxical image&quot; of a composer best known for the latter. Regardless, the ease at which his secular output can be analyzed—both stylistically and chronologically—does not transfer here. The various church forms are treated distinctly, often without stylistic parallels. There are also departures from Binchois&#x27; secular characteristics: very few Burgundian cadences (octave-leap cadences), less major prolation, more selective &quot;tempus perfectum diminutum&quot; and less regular symmetry.

Counterpoint was not a priority to Binchois, who instead emphasized text declamation and musical contour. Thus his sacred output is often considered comparatively uninspired and routine; &quot;severely practical&quot; in the opinion of Pryer. Oftentimes the work&#x27;s chant source is harmonized in a basic, &quot;note-against-note&quot; manner, with such harmony in the top voice, akin to the continental standard then. Homophony is his sacred texture of choice, typically in the fauxbourdon style, melodies based on the Parisian rite—a then-fashionable approach in Burgundy. Fallows notes that even the simplistic counterpoint in his magnificats is more extreme in unremarkability than routine magnificats by Du Fay and Dunstaple. From these characteristics, Fallows considers Binchois&#x27; sacred works most similar to those of Johannes Brassart and Johannes de Limburgia.

==Legacy==
Modern musicologists generally hold Binchois, along with Du Fay and John Dunstable as the three major European composers of the early 15th-century. Binchois, however, is usually ranked below the other two. Although Du Fay and Binchois have been grouped together since their lifetimes, the musicologist Reinhard Strohm considers this misleading, noting that while Binchois &quot;earned his enormous reputation in the one genre in which he excelled as a composer, performer and possibly even poet, Du Fay&#x27;s creativity unfolded along many more musical lines&quot;. In general Du Fay is often considered the leading European composer of his lifetime, and his career was both lengthier and more prolific than Binchois. While Dunstaple was described by the musicologist Margaret Bent as &quot;probably the most influential English composer of all time.&quot; Reflecting on this, Fallows contends that regardless, &quot;the extent to which [Binchois&#x27;] works were borrowed, cited, parodied and intabulated in the later 15th century implies that he had more direct influence than either [Du Fay or Dunstaple]&quot;.

His tunes appeared in copies decades after his death, and were often used as sources for Mass composition by later composers. About half of his extant secular music is found in the manuscript Oxford, Bodleian Library MS Canon. misc. 213.

<doc id="192561" wikidata="Q1140896" url="?curid=192561" title="Komura Jutarō">
<text>was a Japanese statesman and diplomat.

==Early life==
Komura was born to a lower-ranking samurai family in the service of the Obi Domain in Kyushu&#x27;s Hyūga Province (now Nichinan, Miyazaki Prefecture). He attended the &quot;Daigaku Nankō&quot;, the predecessor of Tokyo Imperial University. In 1875, he was selected by the Ministry of Education as one of the first students to study abroad under a government scholarship. At Harvard University, Komura shared lodgings with the fellow Japanese student Kaneko Kentarō. Komura graduated from Harvard Law School in 1878.

While at Harvard, Kaneko and Komura visited the home of Alexander Graham Bell and spoke on an experimental telephone with a fellow Japanese student, Izawa Shunji. According to Bell, this was the first instance of any language besides English being spoken into the new invention.

==Career==
In 1880, Komura joined the Ministry of Justice and, after serving as a judge of the Supreme Court of Japan, transferred in 1884 to the Translation Bureau in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

In 1893, Komura was the chargé d&#x27;affaires at the Japanese legation in Beijing, in Qing dynasty China. In that position, he conveyed to the Chinese government Japan&#x27;s intention of dispatching troops to Korea under the provisions of the Treaty of Tientsin to subdue the Tonghak Rebellion, which led to the First Sino-Japanese War. During the war, Komura was appointed as civilian administrator for territories Japan had captured in Manchuria. He was also a key figure in the negotiations to end the war, culminating in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which he helped to draft.

Following the assassination of Queen Min of Korea, Komura was dispatched to replace Miura Gorō as the Japanese minister to Korea. In his position as resident minister in Korea, he negotiated the Komura-Weber Memorandum in May 1896 with his Russian counterpart, Karl Ivanovich Weber, to allow joint interference in Korean internal affairs by the Japanese and the Russian Empires.

Komura served as Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs until September 1898, when he was named ambassador to Washington, D.C.

In September 1901, Komura became Minister for Foreign Affairs under the first Katsura administration, and he signed the Boxer Protocol on behalf of Japan. He was elevated into the kazoku peerage with the title of baron (&quot;danshaku&quot;) in 1902 and decorated with the 1st class of the Order of the Rising Sun.

In 1902, Komura helped to conclude the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902. His tenure as foreign minister was marked with increasing tension between Japan and Russia over Korea and Manchuria, which cumulated in the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905.

 After the withdrawal of Russian forces in the region, Russian diplomats Witte and Rosen and their Japanese colleagues Takahira Ochiai, Komura, and others met in Portsmouth to sign the peace treaty. During the negotiations, Witte tried to keep Russia&#x27;s rights on the southern part of Sakhalin island, referring to the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875), which gave the Kuril Islands to Japan in exchange for Russian rights in Sakhalin, but Komura declared that &quot;war cancels all treaties.&quot;

The war was ended with Komura&#x27;s signature on behalf of the Japanese government of the Treaty of Portsmouth, which was highly unpopular in Japan and led to the Hibiya incendiary incident.

Komura also met with E. H. Harriman, the American railway magnate, to propose a joint venture between Harriman&#x27;s conglomerate and Japan towards the development of the South Manchuria Railway. On his return to Japan, he found that the agreement was opposed by the genrō and so it was not implemented.

Komura also met with Chinese representatives in Beijing and signed the Peking Treaty of December 1905, which transferred the former Russian rights in southern Manchuria to Japan.

For those services, Komura was awarded the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in 1906 and was appointed to become a member of the Privy Council.

From June 1906 to August 1908, Komura served as ambassador to Britain and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath by King Edward VII and a member of the Royal Victorian Order. On his return to Tokyo, he resumed the post of foreign minister in the second Katsura administration and signed the Root–Takahira Agreement with the United States. His peerage title was also elevated to that of Count (&quot;hakushaku&quot;) in 1907.

Komura also played a key role in the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty in 1910 and in concluding various international agreements in 1911 to restore Japan&#x27;s tariff autonomy. He was elevated to the title of Marquis (&quot;koshaku&quot;) on April 21, 1911.

Suffering from tuberculosis in his final years, Komura moved to the seaside resort of Hayama in Kanagawa Prefecture, but he died of the disease on November 26, 1911. His grave is at Aoyama Cemetery, Tokyo.

==In popular culture==
In Ryōtarō Shiba&#x27;s semi-historical work &quot;Saka no Ue no Kumo&quot;, Komura inherited massive debts from his father, which he had difficulty with repayment. As a result, he wore the same frayed frock coat for years, regardless of season or occasion. That, combined with his short stature and a large mustache, led to the derisive nickname of &quot;the rat minister&quot; in the diplomatic community in his early career. In the Japanese Taiga drama adaptation of Shiba’s work, the role of Komura is played by actor Naoto Takenaka.

<doc id="192566" wikidata="Q1571755" url="?curid=192566" title="Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis">
<text>In primatology, the Machiavellian intelligence or social brain hypothesis describes the capacity of primates to manuever in complex social groups. The first introduction of this concept came from Frans de Waal&#x27;s book &quot;Chimpanzee Politics&quot; (1982). In the book de Waal notes that chimpanzees performed certain social maneuvering behaviors that he thought of as being &quot;Machiavellian&quot;. 

This hypothesis posits that large brains and distinctive cognitive abilities of primates have evolved via intense social competition in which social competitors developed increasingly sophisticated strategies as a means to achieve higher social and reproductive success.

==Overview==

===Origin of the term===
The term &quot;Machiavellian intelligence&quot; originates from the primatologist Frans de Waal, who noted that the behaviors of primates was so elaborate that it could perhaps be compared to political behavior today. 

Primatologists Nicholas Humphrey, Andrew Whiten and Richard Byrne were instrumental in developing this theory. Byrne and Whiten edited two volumes that compiled interdisciplinary research exploring the theme, &quot;Machiavellian Intelligence: Social Expertise and the Evolution of Intellect in Monkeys, Apes, and Humans&quot; (Oxford University Press, 1988) and &quot;Machiavellian Intelligence II: Extensions and Evaluations&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1997). They observed that primates, particularly great apes, displayed intricate social behaviors such as alliance formation, deception, and reconciliation. These behaviors seemed to require cognitive abilities beyond what was necessary for basic survival tasks like foraging or avoiding predators.

==Relations with other research==
As a concept, it is also conflated with, and mistaken for the Machiavellianism personality construct, which focuses on the affective-interpersonal traits of human beings, such as unemotionality and exploitativeness, while Machiavellian Intelligence deals with the social behaviors of primates and is not focused on immoral actions.

==Behaviors of organisms==
Machiavellian intelligence may be demonstrated by primate behaviors including:
*Mate seeking
*Acts of reciprocity and aggression
*Complex group manuevers, such as co-operation and competition
* Acts of misdirection by the primate

==Criticisms==
===Food and nutrient factors===
The claim that large brains are linked to large social groups in primates and cetaceans, on which the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis is based, is criticized by a number of researchers for overlooking the availability of food as a common limiting factor for brain size and social group size. Among primates as well as cetaceans, there are some opportunistic species that eat most types of food and other species that are specialised in particular types of food, as well as differences in the overall availability of food between different geographical regions in which the animals live. Some critics of Machiavellian intelligence argue that species that have to keep their use of nutrients down due to food poverty or specialisation in a rare type of food lowers average brain size for species that live in smaller groups, making big brains falsely appear to be linked to large groups due to the common causes of opportunistic foraging for nutritious food and a rich supply of food. These critics also cite that the &quot;exceptions&quot; in the form of small-brained primates in very large groups typically eat abundant but nutrient-poor foods (such as geladas that eat grass), as predicted by the food-based model, and argue that the higher individual need for nutrients put on by large brains causes groups to become smaller if the species have the same degree of digestive specialisation and environmental availability of food.

<text>Maurice Greene (12 August 1696 – 1 December 1755) was an English composer and organist. He was an admirer and friend of George Frideric Handel.

== Biography and works ==
He was born in London, the son of a cleric, Thomas Green(e) (1648–1720) who was a chaplain of the Chapel Royal, and his wife Mary Shelton (d. 1722). He became a choirboy at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral under Jeremiah Clarke and Charles King. He studied the organ under Richard Brind, and after Brind died, Greene became organist at St Paul&#x27;s.

With the death of William Croft in 1727, Greene became organist at the Chapel Royal, and in 1730 he became Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. In 1735 he was appointed Master of the King&#x27;s Musick. At his death, Greene was working on the compilation &quot;Cathedral Music&quot;, which his student and successor as Master of the King&#x27;s Musick, William Boyce, was to complete. Many items from that collection are still used in Anglican services today.

Greene wrote in the prevailing Georgian England, particularly longer verse anthems, of which &quot;Lord, Let Me Know Mine End&quot;, is a representative example. In it, Greene sets the text using a polyphonic texture over a continuous instrumental walking bass, with an effective treble duet in the middle of the work. Both this section and the end of the anthem contain examples of the Neapolitan sixth chord. His organ voluntaries — published only some years after his death — are closer to Thomas Roseingrave in style than, say, John Stanley or William Boyce, and are more contrapuntal than melodic. They do not specify manuals or stops, unlike later contemporaries such as Bennett, Boyce and Stanley. Instances of &#x27;false relation&#x27; can be heard frequently in these works. Chromaticism is also common in the voluntaries.

Greene died in 1755 aged 59 and was initially buried at St Olave Old Jewry. On the church&#x27;s demolition in 1887, he was reburied in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Works==
Greene wrote a good deal of both sacred and secular vocal music, including:
* the anthem &quot;Hearken Unto Me, Ye Holy Children&quot; (1728).
* the oratorio &quot;The Song of Deborah and Barak&quot; (1732)
* the oratorio &quot;Jephtha&quot; (1737), libretto by John Hoadly (1711–76).
* the opera &quot;Florimel&quot; (1734).
* settings of sonnets from Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Amoretti&quot; (1739).
* a collection of anthems (1743), of which the best-known is &quot;Lord, Let Me Know Mine End&quot;.
* the opera &quot;Phoebe&quot; (completed 1747).

He also published keyboard music, including:
*&quot;Choice Lessons&quot;, for harpsichord or spinet (London, 1733).
*&quot;6 Overtures … in Seven Parts&quot;, arranged for harpsichord or spinet (London, 1745).
*&quot;A Collection of Lessons&quot;, for harpsichord (London, 1750).
*&quot;Twelve Voluntarys&quot;, for organ or harpsichord ((published posthumously by J. Bland of Holborn) London, 1779).

<text>Emmerdale (known as Emmerdale Farm until 1989) is a British television soap opera that is broadcast on ITV. The show is set in Emmerdale (known as Beckindale until 1994), a fictional village in the Yorkshire Dales. Created by Kevin Laffan, &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; was first broadcast on 16 October 1972. Interior scenes have been filmed at the Leeds Studios since its inception. Exterior scenes were first filmed in Arncliffe in Littondale, and the series may have taken its name from Amerdale, an ancient name of Littondale. Exterior scenes were later shot at Esholt, but are now shot at a purpose-built set on the Harewood estate.

The series originally aired during the afternoon and was intended to be a three-month television series. However, more episodes were ordered and transmitted during the daytime until 1978, when it was moved to an early-evening prime time slot in most regions. In the late 1980s, a new production team oversaw the name change and introduced more dramatic storylines, as well as increasing the frequency of episodes. As a result of the changes, viewers and popularity surrounding the soap increased and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; began to be considered as a major British soap opera. The programme began broadcasting in high definition on 10 October 2011, and in 2016, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; won the award for Best British Soap at the British Soap Awards for the first time. Since January 2019, &quot;classic episodes&quot; of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; have been broadcast twice daily on ITV3.

==History==
===1972–1985: &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;===
&quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; was created when Kevin Laffan was asked to write a lunchtime farming serial for ITV, as the network was looking to expand its daytime programming after government restrictions on broadcasting hours were relaxed. He initially said no as his agent advised him that writing a soap would tarnish his reputation as a playwright, which he found to be part of a snobbish attitude shown towards soap operas. Laffan eventually said yes and formed a 26-episode play that would act as a 13-week serial. Laffan had worked on a farm for six months in his youth, and said on writing about farm life: &quot;I was intrigued by the idea that farming was a way of life, as opposed to simply a way of earning a living.&quot; The premise of &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; was similar to the BBC Radio 4 soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;, focusing on a family, a farm and characters in a nearby village. The programme&#x27;s farmyard filming was originally modelled on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Riordans&quot;, an Irish soap opera which was broadcast from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s. &quot;The Riordans&quot; broke new ground for soap operas by being filmed largely outdoors (on a farm, owned on the programme by Tom and Mary Riordan) rather than in a studio—the usual practice of British and American soap operas. &quot;The Riordans&quot;″ success demonstrated that a soap opera could be filmed largely outdoors, and Yorkshire Television sent people to its set in County Meath to see the programme&#x27;s production first-hand.

The first episode aired on 16 October 1972 at 1:30pm, and began with the Sugden family convening in the fictional village of Beckindale for the funeral of a relative. Peter Willes, the then-head of serial dramas at Yorkshire Television, did not like that the soap began with a funeral as he found it to be a &quot;very downbeat way to start&quot; and &quot;a big switch-off&quot;. However, Laffan pushed the concept as he felt that a funeral would be the best option from a dramatic viewpoint. The show&#x27;s early years as &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; centred on the Sugden family and rural farm life. The show was originally broadcast twice a week in the afternoon and was regarded by critics as a &quot;sleepy soap&quot; where not much happened. After its initial 13-week run, the positive viewer response led to an increase to 26 weeks and then a 6-month run, which led to the eventual year-long screening of the soap. The increase in episode output was accompanied by a move to a late-afternoon time slot. By 1977, it was moved to a prime time evening slot in most ITV regions.

===1986–1999: Revamp and becoming a major British soap===
In the late 1980s, a new production team headed by executive producer Keith Richardson was brought in, and the show&#x27;s focus moved to the nearby village of Beckindale, with more dramatic storylines such as Pat Sugden&#x27;s 1986 car crash and the 1988 Crossgill fire. By 1988, the show had been moved to an evening time slot in all ITV regions. &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; also began broadcasting episodes year-round that year. Reflecting its change in focus, the title was changed to &quot;Emmerdale&quot; on 14 November 1989. Coinciding with the title change was the introduction of the wealthy Tate family, bringing with them racier storylines. Under Richardson, the soap&#x27;s popularity gradually began to improve. Richardson produced the programme for 24 years, overseeing its transformation from a minor, daytime, rural drama into a major prime time UK soap opera.

By 1993, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was into its third decade on the air and December 1993 saw a major turning point in the show&#x27;s history, when an episode featured a plane crashing into the village of Beckindale, killing four main characters, giving &quot;Emmerdale&quot; its highest-ever audience of 18 million and marking its transformation into a major prime time soap opera. The plane crash &quot;allowed the writers to get rid of much dead wood, and reinvent the soap virtually from scratch,&quot; which included survivors changing the village name from &quot;Beckindale&quot; to &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. The production team had continually had issues with the fictional village&#x27;s geography, but they found that the plane crash allowed them to introduce a village that had continuity. Since the plane crash, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; has had increasingly dramatic storylines and glamorous characters. In 1994, former &quot;Coronation Street&quot; producer Mervyn Watson was hired to inject more humour into the show. New long-term characters, such as the Windsor and Dingle families, were also introduced in the 1990s. The Tates became the soap&#x27;s leading family during the decade.

===2000–2011: Continued success and more episodes===
By 2000, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; episodes were regularly getting 12 million viewers, and the number of episodes per week was increased from three to five. An ITV talent show, &quot;Soapstars&quot;, was held in 2001 to cast the new five-member Calder family; the Calders made their debut on the show in November that year, and all members had left by August 2002. In 2004, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; became the first British soap opera to broadcast six episodes a week. By 2006, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was contending with, and at times beating, &quot;EastEnders&quot; in viewership. In 2007, an hour-long special episode revealing the murderer of Tom King (Kenneth Farrington) aired; the episode gained an average of 8.6 million viewers, peaking at 9.1 million viewers when Tom&#x27;s son Carl (Tom Lister) confesses to the murder. The episode received more than double the amount of viewership &quot;EastEnders&quot; did.

The early and mid-2000s saw the introduction of major long-term characters, including the King family and Cain (Jeff Hordley) and Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). This era also saw high-profile castings such as Patsy Kensit as Sadie King in 2004, and Amanda Donohoe and Maxwell Caulfield as Natasha and Mark Wylde in 2008. Major storylines during this period included a bus crash, Sarah Sugden&#x27;s death in a barn fire, a New Year&#x27;s Eve storm, the Kings River explosion, and the Sugden house fire. In 2009, the longest-tenured character, Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby), was killed off. Jack&#x27;s funeral featured the first on-screen appearance in 13 years of Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier). The same year, long-serving executive producer Keith Richardson was replaced by former series producer Steve November (later replaced by John Whiston). Gavin Blyth became the series producer, followed by Stuart Blackburn after Blyth&#x27;s death. In January 2011, two of the soaps longest-serving characters Viv Hope portrayed by Deena Payne since 1993 and Terry Woods portrayed by Billy Hartman since 1995 respectively, were both killed off as part of a major fire stroyline.

===2012–2021: Anniversary celebrations and events===
&quot;Emmerdale&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary with its first-ever live episode on 17 October 2012. &quot;Emmerdale Live&quot; featured the death of Carl King (Tom Lister) and a live music festival with performances by Scouting for Girls and the Proclaimers as part of the anniversary celebrations. The story of Carl&#x27;s death took the show into 2013, when Kate Oates replaced Blackburn as the new series producer. One of Oates&#x27; aims was to feature more of the village and rural countryside locations and to bring more &quot;balance&quot; to the show instead of focusing on &quot;a few very high-profile stories&quot;. Major storylines during this period included a helicopter crash that killed Ruby Haswell (Alicya Eyo) and Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick), and a multi-car pile-up. In 2016, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was named Best British Soap for the first time at the British Soap Awards. In January 2019, ITV3 began airing episodes of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; from the beginning of the soap&#x27;s inception. Billed &quot;Classic Emmerdale&quot;, ten sequential episodes have been broadcast weekly since.

In March 2019, an episode featuring an exclusively female cast and crew was aired in support of International Women&#x27;s Day. Executive producer Jane Hudson said that the episode was &quot;a great opportunity for &quot;Emmerdale&quot; to show the female talent we have both in front and behind the camera.&quot; In 2020, the production and filming of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to prevent the programme from coming off air, the episodes shown per week were halved from six to three. They were later reduced to two episodes a week, but have since returned to the normal schedule. In September 2020, it was announced that there would be a &quot;big autumn shake-up&quot;; one of the changes included the casting of Paige Sandhu as Meena Jutla. She was later confirmed to be a serial killer and has been responsible for the murders of Leanna Cavanagh (Mimi Slinger), Andrea Tate (Anna Nightingale) and Ben Tucker (Simon Lennon). All of the actors involved expressed a decision to leave the soap and their exits were incorporated into Meena&#x27;s serial killer arc, a storyline which has seen Sandhu awarded Best Villain at the 2021 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards.

On 12 October 2021, it was announced that &quot;Emmerdale&quot; would partake in a special crossover event involving multiple British soaps to promote the topic of climate change ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The event was first suggested by &quot;Emmerdale&quot;&#x27;s executive producer Jane Hudson. It was confirmed that a social media clip featuring two characters from &quot;Emmerdale&quot; would be discussed in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, while &quot;Emmerdale&quot; itself would refer to events in &quot;Casualty&quot;.

===2022–present: Producer and cast changes===
In January 2022, it was confirmed that the production team were in the early stages of creating the 50th anniversary storylines set to air in October 2022. They hinted that the anniversary would see a &quot;huge shake-up&quot;. The anniversary episode received a mixed reaction. &quot;Radio Times&quot; appreciated the writing and acting, as well as how the series has &quot;reinvented itself to turn away from the mundanity of the farm, and into a relevant, powerful and completely gripping soap&quot;. However, it was noted by newspapers how viewers were unimpressed and had expected more drama. In 2023, Hudson, who had been the executive producer of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; since 2018, left her role.

Hudson was replaced internally by Iain Macleod, who was promoted from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;″s executive producer to overseeing both soaps. At the same time, former producer Sophie Roper was reappointed. She confirmed a new era for &quot;Emmerdale&quot; from 2024, with various cast changes and &quot;bold and ground-breaking drama&quot;. The initial cast changes saw short-term characters including Ethan Anderson (Emile John), Nicky Miligan (Lewis Cope) and Suni Sharma (Brahmdeo Shannon Ramana) written out of the soap. However, they later also removed characters with lengthy tenures, including Amelia Spencer (Daisy Campbell), Wendy Posner (Susan Cookson), Will Taylor (Dean Andrews), Brenda Walker (Lesley Dunlop) and Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi). Uploading episodes early onto ITVX was introduced in 2024, to give viewers more flexibility in when they want to watch the series. This was inspired by a 30% rise of viewing figures for &quot;Emmerdale&quot; on ITVX. 

==Setting and characters==
&quot;Emmerdale&quot; has had a large number of characters since it began, with its cast gradually expanding in size. The series has also had changing residences and businesses for its characters. The series is set in Emmerdale (known as Beckindale until 1994), a fictional village in the Yorkshire Dales. It has been noted that the fictional village spans 3,217 acres and is located 39 miles from Bradford and 52 miles from Leeds. A farmhouse, Emmerdale Farm, was the original focal point of the show when it was first broadcast in 1972. The farmhouse was eventually written out of the series in the early 1990s. Local public house The Woolpack is &quot;the heart of the community&quot;. Owners of the Woolpack have included Amos Brearly (Ronald Magill), Henry Wilks (Arthur Pentelow), Alan Turner (Richard Thorp), Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen), Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter), and Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). Home Farm is a mansion in Emmerdale; it was first introduced on-screen as Miffield Hall in 1973 and was renamed in 1978. Other locales include a factory, a bed-and-breakfast, a corner shop, an outdoor-pursuits centre, and various cafés.

The Sugdens, owners of Emmerdale Farm, were its first family. Many of its members, and those of the Merrick and Skilbeck families, have left or been killed off since the mid-1990s. Sugdens remaining in the village are Jack&#x27;s daughter, Victoria Sugden (Isabel Hodgins), her son Harry, and Andy Sugden&#x27;s (Kelvin Fletcher) daughter Sarah (Katie Hill).

December 1984 saw the arrival of Caroline Bates; her teenage children, Kathy and Nick, followed in late 1985. Caroline left the show in 1989, returning for guest appearances in 1991, 1993–1994 and 1996. Nick was written out of the show when he was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1997. Kathy and her niece, Alice, remained in the village until late 2001; by then, Kathy had outlived two husbands. The wealthy Tates were introduced as the new owners of Home Farm in 1989, with the family consisting of Frank Tate (Norman Bowler), wife Kim (Claire King) and children Chris (Peter Amory) and Zoe (Leah Bracknell).

Other families followed: the middle-class Windsors in 1993, known as the Hope family after Viv&#x27;s (Deena Payne) 2001 marriage to Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw), and the ne&#x27;er-do-well Dingle family in 1994. The Tate, Windsor-Hope and Dingle families predominated during the 1990s and 2000s. The era&#x27;s storylines included the 1993 plane crash, the 1994 Home Farm siege, the 1998 post-office robbery, the 2000 bus crash, the 2003–04 storm and the 2006 King show-home collapse. By the mid- to late-2000s, the last of the Tates (Zoe, daughter Jean and nephew Joseph) had emigrated to New Zealand. In 2009, Chris Tate&#x27;s ex-wife Charity and their son Noah returned to the village. In 2017, Joe Tate returned to the village. In 2018, Kim Tate returned to the village after nearly 20-year absence, and in the following year her son James returned as well. Members of the Windsor-Hope family left the village in early 2006, and Viv Hope was killed off in a village fire in February 2011 after nearly 18 years on the show. As of 2024, only Donna Windsor&#x27;s daughter, April, and the Hope branch of the family (Bob and his daughter Cathy) remain.

The King family arrived in 2004, as the Tates departed. All but Jimmy King, his half-sister, Scarlett Nicholls, and his three children, Elliott, Angelica and Carl, were killed off. By 2018, most of the Dingles still remained, having actually increased their numbers in Emmerdale over the years. Their circumstances had changed in their two decades in the village; Chas Dingle owned half of The Woolpack, with Charity Dingle owning the other half, and Marlon was a chef there. In 2014, the Dingles, Bartons and Whites were the central families; the Bartons are a farming family, and the Whites owned Home Farm. In 2022, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy stated that the Dingles were &quot;arguably the best-known family from the current cast.&quot;

==Storylines==
Over the years, along with its stories of romance and family life, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; has highlighted a range of different social issues.

In January 2021, a poll was conducted by &quot;YorkshireLive&quot; to see which storylines in the soap&#x27;s history viewers felt had impacted &quot;Emmerdale&quot; the most. The top ten, in order of first to tenth, was: the Emmerdale plane crash (1993), the storm that killed Tricia Dingle (Sheree Murphy) on the 10th anniversary of the plane crash (2003), the Hotten bypass crash (2016), Belle Dingle&#x27;s (Eden Taylor-Draper) mental health battle (2016), the mirror maze which led to Val Pollard&#x27;s (Charlie Hardwick) death (2015), Ashley Thomas&#x27; (John Middleton) battle with dementia (2016), the post office robbery (1994), Dave Glover&#x27;s (Ian Kelsey) death (1996), Ross Barton&#x27;s (Michael Parr) acid attack (2018) and the 40th anniversary episode which saw Carl King&#x27;s (Tom Lister) death, two births and a wedding (2012).

==Broadcast==
===United Kingdom===
&quot;Emmerdale&quot; was initially broadcast two afternoons a week in 1972, typically on Mondays and Tuesdays. From 1977, the series moved out of the daytime programming slot, with eight out of the fourteen ITV regions choosing to accommodate the programme in the 7:00pm Tuesday and Thursday slots. The other six regions, including all of Scotland and London, preferred the 5:15pm slots on Mondays and Tuesdays. From 6 January 1988, all ITV regions networked the show in the 6:30pm slot, but two years later, the transmission time reverted to 7:00pm, still twice weekly. By January 1997, ITV had opted to increase output to three episodes a week, and from October 2000, a further two episodes were added, meaning &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was broadcasting every weekday. A sixth episode begin to air on Sundays in 2004, making &quot;Emmerdale&quot; the first British soap to broadcast six episodes a week. In January 2008, as with &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, ITV announced they would cease airing &quot;Emmerdale&quot; on a Sunday night; this meant that &quot;Emmerdale&quot; would still air at 7:00pm each weekday, but to compensate, the Tuesday episode would run until 8:00pm. Producers of the soap explained that &quot;each hour-long episode on Tuesday will be specially written and won&#x27;t be two half-hour ones put together.&quot; The move meant that the second half of &quot;Emmerdale&quot;″s Tuesday episode would clash with rival BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

On 8 July 2009, ITV announced that they were to revamp their schedule yet again. This time, &quot;Emmerdale&quot;″s Tuesday hour-long episode was reduced back down to 30 minutes, and replaced with a second Thursday episode. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot; ratings improved due to this, with &quot;Emmerdale&quot; getting 7.7 million, its highest in over 6 months, on 1 October 2009. Between April and August 2019, ITV began airing an additional episode on Tuesdays at 8pm, bringing the total number of episodes a week to seven, but it was reduced back to six due to the heavy amount of filming for cast and crew involved. In March 2020, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, filming was suspended, and the episodes transmitted per week were decreased to three on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. For three weeks of June 2020, two episodes of &quot;Emmerdale&quot; were transmitted per week in order to preserve episodes. At the end of June, episodes returned to three per week. In September, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; returned to its regular transmission count of six weekly episodes. In January 2022, it was announced that after 32 years, &quot;Emmerdale&quot;″s transmission time would move to 7:30pm, due to the &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; receiving a longer duration, with Thursday&#x27;s episodes merged into one hour-long slot. The new scheduling began on Monday 7 March 2022. The change meant that &quot;Emmerdale&quot; once again clashed with &quot;EastEnders&quot;, this time being a daily occurence.

From 2026 onwards, &quot;Emmerdale&quot;″s scheduling is again set to change. It was confirmed that half an hour of content would be dropped from the schedule. Another change was the timeslot, with the soap set to air every weekday at 8pm for 30 minutes, with &quot;Coronation Street&quot; airing afterwards. ITV&#x27;s Managing Director of Media and Entertainment Kevin Lygo explained: &quot;research insights show us that soap viewers are increasingly looking to the soaps for their pacey storytelling. Streaming-friendly, 30 minute episodes better provide the opportunity to meet viewer expectations for storyline pace, pay-off and resolution.&quot;

===International broadcast===
&quot;Emmerdale&quot; reaches viewers in the Republic of Ireland via Virgin Media One, which broadcasts the series simultaneously with ITV in the UK. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was formerly broadcast during the day on RTÉ One from 1972 to 2001, before it moved to TV3, now known as Virgin Media One. RTÉ were several months behind; for many years, they broadcast the show five days a week (instead of ITV&#x27;s three days a week) and took a break during the summer. As the series began a five-night week, RTÉ fell behind the ITV broadcasts; the gap between RTÉ One&#x27;s last episode and TV3&#x27;s first episode was approximately three months. In 2015, UTV (the Northern Irish ITV Region holder) decided to buy the rights to ITV programming for the Republic of Ireland. It was broadcast on UTV Ireland (now Virgin Media Three) in 2015 and 2016, it was then moved back to TV3 (now known as Virgin Media one) when Virgin Media Ireland, the owners of the TV3 Group (now known as Virgin Media Television Ireland) bought UTV Ireland from ITV, following the sale of UTV to ITV a few months previously.

The series has appeared in Sweden as &quot;Hem till gården&quot; (&quot;Home to the Farm&quot;) since the 1970s – originally on TV2, and since 1994, on TV4. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; is the most-watched daytime non-news programme in Sweden, attracting from 150,000 to 200,000 viewers daily. The programme appears in Finland on MTV3 where it attracts an average of 200,000 to 250,000 viewers per episode, making it the most watched non-Finnish every-weekday program in Finnish television. Ratings have, however, declined in the past few years, previously being consecutively around 350,000 to 400,000 per episode. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; is broadcast in New Zealand on TVNZ 1, where it is the second-most-watched daytime programme, after the news. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; was broadcast in Australia for the first time in July 2006, when UKTV began airing the series with episode 4288. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; has been available to viewers in the United States via the BritBox streaming service since March 2017. New episodes typically appear on the service within five hours of their original broadcast in the UK.

==Production==
===Filming locations===
The original &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; buildings are located near to the village of Leathley. The buildings are one of the few original filming locations used for the entire series and have been involved in numerous storylines. Scenes initially filmed in the farmhouse were filmed at Lindley Farm, owned by Arthur Peel, a farmer. Laffan and the researchers found his farm ideal for scenes and the location was large enough for cast and crew members to park their vehicles there. Yorkshire Television promised Peel to keep his identity and the location of his farm a secret, but viewers eventually discovered both and would visit in the hopes of meeting the cast there. Location shooting was originally filmed in the village of Arncliffe in Littondale, a quiet valley in the Yorkshire Dales. The Falcon, the village hotel, served as the fictional Woolpack Inn. After four years of filming there, it was moved to the village of Esholt in 1976. The Woolpack&#x27;s real-life location was changed to Commercial Inn in Esholt, and eventually, the real owner of the inn agreed to change the name to the Woolpack.

After the soap began transmitting episodes 52 weeks of the year, the production needed more space. This led to the purchase of a four-floor mill in Farsley for £2 million, which a building team converted into the &quot;Emmerdale&quot; Production Centre. Construction of another purpose-built set began on the Harewood estate in 1996 and it has been used since 1997, after being opened by Prime Minister John Major. The Harewood set is a replica of Esholt, with minor alterations. Filming returned to Esholt for a one-off episode in 2016 for a special episode centred around Ashley Thomas&#x27; (John Middleton) dementia which aired in December 2016. The location was used to represent Ashley&#x27;s onset of dementia to the viewer. Location filming is also done in the City of Leeds and other West Yorkshire locations; scenes set in the fictional market town of Hotten are currently filmed in Otley, and previously in Farsley. Benton Park School in Rawdon and the primary school in Farnley were also used for filming. Interiors are primarily filmed at Yorkshire Television&#x27;s Emmerdale Production Centre in Leeds, next to Yorkshire&#x27;s Leeds Studios.

Four farms have been featured on &quot;Emmerdale&quot; over the years:

===Sponsors===
&quot;Emmerdale&quot; first sponsor (from 14 December 1999 to 20 February 2002) was Daz detergent, followed by Heinz Tomato Ketchup and Heinz salad cream from May 2003 to May 2005, a deal that cost Heinz £10 million. Reckitt Benckiser took over until 2009 in another £10 million deal, advertising Calgon, Air Wick, Veet, and Lemsip. After reports of Littlewoods pulling out of a two-year deal, Tombola Bingo underwrote the show from November 2009 to March 2012, followed by Bet365 Bingo until March 2014. McCain Foods began a two-year £8 million sponsorship on 7 April 2014. Then on 15 April 2020, the People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery took over as sponsor of the programme. Two years later, Confused.com replaced the People&#x27;s Postcode Lottery as &quot;Emmerdale&quot;″s sponsor until July 2024. In August, Specsavers replaced Confused.com.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
As of 2024, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; generally attracts an average of 4 million viewers. During the 1990s, the series had an average of 10–11 million viewers per episode. On 30 December 1993, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; had its largest-ever audience of 18 million when a plane crashed into the village. On 27 May 1997, 13 million viewers saw Frank Tate (Norman Bowler) die of a heart attack after the return of wife Kim (Claire King). On 20 October 1998, 12.5 million viewers saw the Woolpack explode after a fire. Kim Tate&#x27;s departure from the show on 19 January 1999 was watched by nearly 15 million viewers.

In January 2022, their overnight viewing figures saw &quot;Emmerdale&quot; become the most watched soap opera in the United Kingdom. They beat &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a fellow ITV soap that had consistently beaten &quot;Emmerdale&quot; in the ratings. The rise in viewers was accredited to Meena&#x27;s serial killer storyline.

===Critical and viewer response===

Numerous &quot;Emmerdale&quot; storylines have been criticised by viewers, due to suggestions that they are too controversial. In March 2022, &quot;Leeds Live&quot; compiled a list of top storylines that viewers were disgusted by, with the list including Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) having sex with an underage Ollie Reynolds (Vicky Binns), Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) having a baby with her second-cousin Cain, Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) assisting a quadriplegic Jackson Walsh (Marc Silcock) to die, Maya Stepney (Louisa Clein) grooming step-son Jacob Gallagher (Joe-Warren Plant) and Pierce Harris (Jonathan Wrather) raping Rhona Goskirk (Zoë Henry).

Another storyline that attracted a strong viewer response is an arc that saw Meena Jutla (Paige Sandhu) be revealed as a serial killer, with her confessing to two off-screen murders, as well as murdering regulars Leanna Cavanagh (Mimi Slinger), Andrea Tate (Anna Nightingale) and Ben Tucker (Simon Lennon). Meena immediately caused division in viewers&#x27; opinions from her introduction, and after Meena is revealed to be a serial killer, critics and viewers began to praise the character and Sandhu&#x27;s acting skills, with many believing Meena had become a &quot;top soap serial killer&quot;.

Duncan Lindsay of the &quot;Metro&quot; described Meena as &quot;the most unique and entertaining soap villain ever&quot; and admitted that he wanted her to get away with her crimes due to her strong presence on &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. Many viewers praised Meena, and credited her with being the most interesting part of &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, while some complained about the violence shown in her murderous scenes, with Ofcom receiving hundreds of complaints about her brutality.

Despite criticism, Meena regularly trended on Twitter and garnered an online fandom, the &#x27;Meeniacs&#x27;, who felt that the soap would not be the same following her exit. Her storyline also increased &quot;Emmerdale&quot;″s ratings to the point of becoming the most-watched soap opera in the United Kingdom. In September 2021, it was announced that Sandhu had been nominated for Best Newcomer and Best Villain at the 2021 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards. Meena murdering Leanna was also nominated for Best Show-Stopper. Sandhu went on to win the award for Best Villain.

<text>VAST is an American alternative rock band based in Seattle, United States. The acronym VAST stands for Visual Audio Sensory Theater and is the main creation of singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Jon Crosby. The band is signed to 2blossoms, an independent record company created by Crosby.

VAST&#x27;s sound is identifiable as ambient electro-rock with considerable industrial and acoustic influences, usually made with Crosby&#x27;s traditional acoustic guitar, electronic instruments and processing, drum-driven tracks, and heavy bass. Vocally similarities range from classic rock to post-grunge. In recent years, however, VAST&#x27;s sound has been more identifiable with acoustic rock in releases such as &quot;April&quot; and &quot;Me and You&quot;. The band&#x27;s latest release is 2018&#x27;s &quot;She Is Murder&quot; EP

==History==
===Early years===
Crosby&#x27;s musical endeavors began at the age of 13, where he was noted in &quot;Guitar Player Magazine&quot; as a promising guitarist of the future. Growing up, Crosby spent his teen years in Humboldt County, California. He often recorded home demos with nothing more than a guitar and a drum machine, sometimes a bass player with him as well. He nearly signed onto a guitar-based label Shrapnel, but turned it down to work on his budding songwriting skills. Crosby eventually left Rancho Cotate High School in Rohnert Park, California, to do home study and begin his own band, which he dubbed VAST. Much like fellow alternative rock/industrial band Nine Inch Nails, Crosby was the only member but found a touring band who knew the songs well enough to play with him live.

After sending multiple demo tapes to nearby radio stations in his home state of California, the band got a contract with Elektra Records. VAST released a teaser of their upcoming debut album &quot;Visual Audio Sensory Theater&quot;, titled &quot;VAST Is...&quot;, which featured the first four tracks of the album. The track &quot;Touched&quot; received considerable amounts of airplay on local radio stations before capturing the attention of a mainstream audience, when it was featured in the Dana Brown surfing film &quot;Step into Liquid&quot;. It also received exposure when it was played briefly in the trailer for the movie &quot;The Beach&quot; (even though the song never made it to the actual soundtrack). NBC also used it as a promo song during TV show advertisements.

After &quot;Visual Audio Sensory Theater&quot;, Elektra pressured Crosby to go back to the drawing board and craft an album that was accessible to more listeners, but still retaining the distinct sound of the last album. After two years of recording, VAST returned with 2000&#x27;s &quot;Music for People&quot;. The album featured a more rock-oriented sound, and benefited from major-label funding by allowing Crosby to work with the New Bombay Recording Orchestra in India. Turmoil was abundant during the album&#x27;s recording and rehearsal process as Crosby constantly fought with record executives over the music&#x27;s direction and former backup guitarist Rowan Robertson wishing to leave VAST to begin his own solo career. By the end of the album&#x27;s recording process, Robertson had left VAST, and Crosby reluctantly moved forward with the band. &quot;Music for People&quot; provided the band with MTV airplay through their lead single &quot;Free&quot;&#x27;s music video, with the single charting on the Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100, and hitting No. 2 on the Modern Rock Tracks. The band became a relative success after &quot;Music for People&quot;, but the album&#x27;s poor sales and lack of a second charting single led to tension between Elektra and Crosby. In late 2002, Elektra terminated VAST&#x27;s contract.

===Turquoise and Crimson years (2001–2005)===
In 2004, Crosby recorded bundles of tracks that were titled &quot;Turquoise 3.x&quot; and &quot;Crimson 3.x&quot;; they were released through an online electronic delivery outlet. Crosby solidified his band&#x27;s line-up during this time, and from then on, VAST became a four-person band. With the unusual method of distribution of these tracks by a band with a relatively large fanbase formerly signed to a major label, many record companies were outraged with the releases. As a result, from pressure from his former label, Elektra, Crosby was forced to sign a short-term deal with Carson Daly-owned independent label 456 Entertainment to release the best of both bundles as one album, titled &quot;Nude&quot;. This release also had the most high-quality versions of the songs, as the online releases were only available via mp3. In later years, Crosby said the idea of releasing &quot;Nude&quot; on an indie label was a &quot;nightmare&quot; because &quot;There were so many problems dealing with them (456 Entertainment) on every level. I feel we made a big mistake not believing in ourselves enough and doing it on our own.&quot;

===2blossoms years (2005–2009)===
After a short tour for &quot;Nude&quot;, the band released 2blossoms&#x27;s first release, &quot;A Complete Demonstration&quot;, which was a collection of early demo tracks during the Visual Audio sessions. The album was a limited-edition piece and sold quickly due to popular demand. Then in 2006, VAST released &quot;Turquoise &amp; Crimson&quot;, a double-disc collection of all the tracks that were released as bundles online in 2004 online under his label. Originally it was only available through the 2blossoms website, but it was later released to retail stores. During the tour for the double album, VAST played at CBGB&#x27;s, and, in late 2006, released &quot;Live at CBGB&#x27;s&quot; on their 2blossoms record to moderate sales. After multiple tours, VAST went back to the studio and recorded their first all-acoustic album, &quot;April&quot;.

The release method for &quot;April&quot; was, once again, unorthodox. In 2006, Crosby released an online version of the acoustic album online with ten tracks. &quot;April&quot; was mostly recorded only by Crosby and an acoustic guitar, with minimal use of bass and drums. After the online release, Crosby said he was unhappy with it and went back to the studio to add four new tracks and a whole new track listing. The cover featured fan-made artwork, and the album received a traditional release in stores. The album was not as well received by critics and fans, but was modestly embraced. Crosby later said that he only had it in him to do one album like &quot;April&quot;, and that it was his favorite VAST album.

Crosby also released a span of solo albums entitled &quot;Generica&quot; with him and an acoustic guitar throughout 2007 and 2008, culminating in a collection in 2009. The music would later find its way onto VAST albums being reworked into a full-band setting on future release &quot;Me and You&quot;.

Despite an expected documentary entitled &quot;Closed Romantic Realism&quot;, 2008 saw the release of an EP for Crosby&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Bang Band SiXXX&quot;. The EP, containing six songs, is closely related to his older music with lots of electronics leading the music instead of acoustic guitars. Crosby claims it is a return to his older, darker sound. The EP is entitled &quot;Bang Band SiXXX: Relay EP&quot;. Many of the songs have become live staples at shows.

In May 2009, Crosby released &quot;Me and You&quot; and a North American tour in support of the album. &quot;Me and You&quot; contains songs from Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Generica&quot; series reworked into a full-band setting. Crosby also is planning on launching a release of the album in which you can purchase the album and allow the proceeds to go to a charity of the purchaser&#x27;s choice. &quot;Me and You&quot; is currently only released through retail.

===Making Evening And Night (2013–2014)===
From October 2013, through the official VAST Facebook account, Crosby put out a total of five &quot;Works In Progress&quot;. Fans were encouraged to vote on their favorite tracks in a similar nature to the release of &quot;Turquoise &amp; Crimson&quot; in 2003. &quot;Works In Progress 1&quot; featured three new demo tracks: &quot;Again And Again&quot;, &quot;Noise&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;d You Go&quot;. &quot;Works In Progress 2&quot; featured five new demo tracks: &quot;They Only Love You When You Die&quot;, &quot;Kimi&quot;, &quot;Fire Of Love&quot;, &quot;Desperate&quot; and &quot;I Want It Back&quot;. &quot;Works In Progress 3&quot; featured four new demo tracks: &quot;Diamonds To Coal&quot;, &quot;Burning Desire&quot;, &quot;The Thing They Took&quot; and &quot;Something About You Turns Me On&quot;. &quot;Works In Progress 4&quot; featured four new demo tracks: &quot;Call On Me&quot;, &quot;Broken Girl&quot;, &quot;Like God&quot; and &quot;Put Your Lips Around My Generation&quot;. The fifth and final installment, &quot;Works In Progress 5&quot;, featured six new demo tracks: &quot;Trail Of Tears&quot;, &quot;Whisper My Name In Your Heart&quot;, &quot;There Is No Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Time&quot;, &quot;I Would Like It&quot;, and &quot;No One Could Know&quot;.

Of all these demo tracks, &quot;Like God&quot; had previously been released in the same demo form in 2005 as part of the official VAST fan club package, &quot;No One Could Know&quot; had been played live in 2009, and &quot;Whisper My Name In Your Heart&quot; was played live in 2009 under the working title of &quot;This Love Song&quot;.

The outcome of this project culminated in the release of &quot;Making Evening and Night&quot; — a double album with disc 1 featuring all the songs the fans voted for, and the second disc featuring the rest. A finished version of this album is yet to be released.

===Stripped Series (2015–2016)===
Late 2015 and early 2016 have seen the releases of Stripped/Black, Stripped/Red and Stripped/Blue; a five-part collection of VAST songs all done acoustically.

Stripped/Orange was released on August 28, 2016. Unlike the other albums in the Stripped series, this album includes bass guitar, electric guitar, djembe, percussion and other vocal overdubs, to create a full sounding recording. A standard, acoustic version was also released. It has also come to be known as “Peeled Orange”.

Although intended to be a five-part series, Stripped/Violet was released in December 2016, with Jon going on to say: &quot;I felt like something was missing from the &quot;Stripped&quot; series. All songs I wrote before the first VAST album ended up ignored. They are a little raw because I wrote them between 16 and 18 years old, but I feel they are an important part of my body of work.&quot; Five of the songs on this album are previously unreleased.

===Black Magic (2017–2018)===
2017 saw the release of Jon&#x27;s second publication, &quot;Ruminations On Everything&quot;, a non-fiction work, also released in audiobook format. &quot;They Only Love You When You Die&quot; EP followed, with a music video for the song announced but remains unreleased. The next two EPs released were &quot;Here I Am&quot; and &quot;Little Darling&quot;. The fourth was &quot;In Lieu Of Flowers&quot;.

November 2017 also saw the release of &quot;Posthumous Serenade&quot;, a two-part collection of twenty acoustic covers done by Crosby (solo) as a tribute to some of his favorite musicians who have died. Artists include Joy Division, Prince and Johnny Cash, among many others.

In March 2018, it was announced that the next VAST album proper will be called &quot;Black Magic&quot;. &quot;She Is Murder&quot; will be the first single lifted from the album, and its music video has been officially posted online.

On April 22, 2018, the official VAST shop website announced the track listing for &quot;Black Magic&quot;, as well as two other releases: a limited edition EP for the song &quot;She Is Murder,&quot; along with a follow-up to the Jon Crosby solo release &quot;Posthumous Serenade&quot; titled &quot;More Posthumous Serenades&quot;.

On April 24, 2018, &quot;The VAST Companion&quot; was made available for pre-order, a book detailing the stories behind VAST songs: &quot;The book goes into where he [Jon] was when he wrote them, what went into making them, and the stories behind each song. Written with humor, introspection, and tenderness, this book will entertain VAST fans universally with anecdotes and stories behind over 100 songs.&quot;

Throughout 2018 the four EP&#x27;s from the previous year were reissued on CD and bundled together. Many of these songs were later compiled for the digital release of the &quot;She is Murder&quot; EP.

As of February 2025, &quot;Black Magic&quot; has not released and is yet to have an official release date announced.

<text>Illicium verum (star anise or badian, Chinese star anise, star anise seed, star aniseed and star of anise) is a medium-sized evergreen tree native to South China and northeast Vietnam. Its star-shaped pericarps harvested just before ripening are a spice that closely resembles anise in flavor. Its primary production country is China, followed by Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries. Star anise oil is highly fragrant, used in cooking, perfumery, soaps, toothpastes, mouthwashes, and skin creams. Until 2012, when they switched to using genetically modified &quot;E. coli&quot;, Roche Pharmaceuticals used up to 90% of the world&#x27;s annual star anise crop to produce oseltamivir (Tamiflu) via shikimic acid.

==Etymology and nomenclature==

&quot;Illicium&quot; comes from the Latin meaning &quot;entice&quot; or &quot;seduce&quot;.

&quot;Verum&quot; means &quot;true&quot; or &quot;genuine&quot;.

The name &quot;badian&quot; appears to derive, via French , from the apparently descriptive Chinese name for it, , , lit. &quot;eight horns&quot;. However, a derivation from the Persian &quot;,&quot; &quot;fennel&quot;, exists, with the Oxford English Dictionary indicating that its origin before that is unknown.

==Description==
Leaves are aromatic, simple and lanceolate, obovate-elliptic or elliptic, size of 5–15 cm × 2–5 cm, coriaceous to thickly coriaceous. The leaves are 5–15 cm × 1.5–5 cm, apex acute, lower side pubescent. Flowers are solitary, bisexual, pink to dark red, axillary or subterminal. The perianth has lobes 7–12, arranged spirally; stamens number of 11–20, arranged spirally, with short, thick filaments; carpels usually 8, free, arranged in a single whorl. Flower peduncle size is 1.5–4 cm, tepals number range from seven to twelve, and are broadly elliptic to broadly ovate, anthers size is 1–1.5 mm, pollen grains trisyncolpate.

The fruit is a capsule-like follicetum, star-shaped, reddish-brown, consisting of six to eight follicles arranged in a whorl. Each follicle is boat-shaped, 1–2 cm long, rough and rigid, color reddish-brown, with 1 seed, opening along the ventral edge when ripe. carpels size of 10 mm long, boat-shaped; they are hard and wrinkled, containing one seed. Seeds are brown, compressed ovoid, smooth, shiny and brittle with approximate size of 8–9 mm × 6 mm.

Differences with similar taxa:
&quot;Illicium anisatum&quot; had smaller fruits that does not form a regular star due to the abortion of some carpels. Also fruit follicles are not swollen in the middle and had a more pointed apex. Also usually had more than 8 follicles and the fruit has weaker odour. The seeds in &quot;Illicium anisatum&quot; are flat or almost spherical.

==Use==

=== Culinary use===
Star anise contains anethole, the same compound that gives anise, an unrelated plant, its flavor. Star anise has come into use in the West as a less expensive substitute for anise in baking, as well as in liquor production, most distinctively in the production of the liqueur Galliano. Star anise enhances the flavor of meat.

It is used as a spice in preparation of &quot;biryani&quot; and &quot;masala chai&quot; all over the Indian subcontinent. It is widely used in Chinese cuisine, and in Malay and Indonesian cuisines. It is widely grown for commercial use in China, India, and most other countries in Asia. Star anise is an ingredient of the traditional five-spice powder of Chinese cooking. It is also a major ingredient in the making of &quot;phở&quot;, a Vietnamese noodle soup.

It is also used in the French recipe of mulled wine, &quot;vin chaud&quot; (hot wine). If allowed to steep in coffee, it deepens and enriches the flavor. The pods can be used in this manner multiple times by the potful or cup, as the ease of extraction of the taste components increases with the permeation of hot water.

===Drug precursor===
Star anise is the major source of the chemical compound shikimic acid, a primary precursor in the pharmaceutical synthesis of the anti-influenza drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu). An industrial method for the production of shikimic acid using fermentation of &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria was discovered in 2005, and applied in the 2009 swine flu pandemic to address Tamiflu shortages, eventually reversing price increases for star anise as a raw material of shikimic acid. As of 2018, fermentation of &quot;E. coli&quot; was the manufacturing process of choice to produce shikimic acid for synthesis of Tamiflu.

==Toxicity of related species==

&quot;Illicium verum&quot; is not toxic. However, other related species are toxic.

Japanese star anise (&quot;Illicium anisatum&quot;), a similar tree, is highly toxic and inedible; in Japan, it has instead been burned as incense. Cases of illness, including &quot;serious neurological effects, such as seizures&quot;, reported after using star anise tea may be a result of deliberate economically motivated adulteration with this species. Japanese star anise contains the neurotoxin anisatin, which also causes severe inflammation of the kidneys (nephritis), urinary tract, and digestive organs when ingested.

Swamp star anise &quot;Illicium parviflorum&quot;, a similar tree found in the southern United States, is highly toxic and should not be used for folk remedies or as a cooking ingredient.

==ISO Standardization==
* ISO 676:1995 – contains the information about the nomenclature of the variety and cultivars

===Identification===
* Refer to the 4th edition of the &quot;European Pharmacopoeia&quot; (1153)

===Differentiation from other species===
Joshi &quot;et al.&quot; have used fluorescent microscopy and gas chromatography to distinguish the species, while Lederer &quot;et al.&quot; employed thin layer chromatography with HPLC-MS/MS.

===Specifications===
* ISO 11178:1995 – a specification for its dried fruits

<text>Jon Crosby (born July 25, 1976) is an American musician and founder of the musical project VAST.

==Biography==
Crosby was born in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Humboldt and Sonoma counties in Northern California, raised by a single mother from an upper-class family who owned a record store in Fortuna, California. His great-grandfather was John C. Crosby, a congressman from Massachusetts, and his ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side is English and Native American. His father was a lounge guitarist whom he never met.

At the age of 13, he was profiled in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine and Shrapnel Magazine as a rising young star. In 1993, aged 16, he moved to Petaluma, California and formed VAST with friends Mike Alioti and Dimitri Katzoff, formerly of ska band The Conspiracy, though the band line-up changed frequently thereafter. The band&#x27;s early shows were mainly at the Phoenix Theater.

At 19, Crosby&#x27;s manager and ex-girlfriend Sakina Sati took him to New York, along with ex-members Daniel Alva and Stephen Garver, for the purpose of shopping his demo tapes through Shiva Baum, former manager for Opiate for the Masses, and after a bidding war he signed with Elektra. Two albums were released by Elektra: &quot;Visual Audio Sensory Theater&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Music For People&quot; in 2000. In 2002, Crosby left the label. In 2003 he released two digital download albums, &quot;Turquoise 3.x&quot; and &quot;Crimson 3.x&quot;. He then moved on to Carson Daly&#x27;s 456 Entertainment, releasing &quot;Nude&quot; in 2004.

In 2003, Crosby started his own record label, 2Blossoms Records &amp; Media. In late 2007 and early 2008, Crosby released five download-only EPs, under the collective title &quot;Generica&quot;, billed as &quot;an exploration of people, places and American music.&quot; The first three volumes were solo acoustic guitar songs, while the last two were recorded with VAST band members under the name &quot;Jon Crosby and the Resonator Band&quot;.

<text>Keith Howell Charles Allen (born 2 September 1953) is a Welsh actor, pantomime star and television presenter. He is the father of singer Lily Allen and actor Alfie Allen, and brother of actor and director Kevin Allen.

==Early life and education ==
Keith Howell Charles Allen was born on 2 September 1953 in Gorseinon, Wales. His father was Edward Charles Owen, a Royal Navy petty officer submariner, and his mother a Welsh waitress. His younger brother is actor Kevin Allen. He spent his early years near Swansea and in Malta, and most of his childhood in Gosport, Hampshire, while his father served in Portsmouth or away at sea. Although he spent much of his life in England, he regards himself as Welsh.

At the age of 11, when his father was posted to Singapore, he was sent to boarding school at Sir Anthony Browns Brentwood, a public school in Essex. He was expelled from the school at the age of 13 after meddling with organ pipes, causing trouble at morning assembly. This led to a period in borstal before attending Brune Park Community School in Gosport. He has said that he went to a comprehensive school in Swansea (where he was in 1966), a public school, a borstal, and a detention centre, all within five years. He earned six O-levels, leading to entry to the Welsh College of Music and Drama. Parking in the principal’s carpark and an ensuing row led to his expulsion from the college.

==Career==
Allen has acted in both films and television, presented television programmers, and has also appeared in pantomimes. 

===Early work===
After having several jobs during the 1970s, including a job as a stagehand from which he was sacked after joining Max Bygraves&#x27; chorus line on stage naked, Allen worked as a stand-up comedian and vocalist, opening for punk bands such as The Clash.

===Acting career===

He appeared in a number of films in the series &quot;The Comic Strip Presents...&quot; on Channel 4 in the 1980s after becoming one of the breakthrough acts of the Comedy Store in 1979. Notable episodes featuring Allen include &quot;The Bullshitters&quot; (a parody of &quot;The Professionals&quot;), and &quot;The Yob&quot; (a parody of &quot;The Fly&quot;), which he also co-wrote. Allen appeared alongside fellow Comic Strip alumni as Pestilence in &quot;The Young Ones&quot; episode &quot;Interesting.&quot; Allen has performed both straight and comedy acting. In 1985 The Comic Strip hit the big screen with &quot;The Supergrass&quot; starring Allen, Adrian Edmondson, Peter Richardson, Jennifer Saunders and Robbie Coltrane, directed by Comic Strip actor Peter Richardson.

In 1986, he appeared in &quot;Comrades&quot;, a film about the Tolpuddle Martyrs.

During the brief period of British Satellite Broadcasting as an alternative satellite broadcaster to Sky, he had a regular comedy show of his own &quot;I Love Keith Allen&quot; on the Galaxy channel, a mix of stand-up and sketches. He appeared in the final Carry On film &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; (1992) playing Pepi The Poisoner.

Allen made a cameo appearance in the black comedy &quot;Twin Town,&quot; directed by his brother Kevin, and the Channel 4 adaptation of &quot;A Very British Coup.&quot; He played the lodger who dies at the beginning of Danny Boyle&#x27;s thriller &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; (1994). In the same year, he played Jonas Chuzzlewit in a BBC adaptation of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. He was used again by Boyle to play a drug dealer in &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996). Danny Boyle has said that Allen&#x27;s character from &quot;Trainspotting&quot; is the same one that moves into the shared flat in &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; – he wears the same clothes. He also appeared disguised as a fictional hip-hop star &quot;Keithski&quot; to present &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 2 March 1995.

In 2000, Allen appeared in two Harold Pinter plays at the Almeida Theatre, playing Lambert in &quot;Celebration&quot; and Mr Sands in &quot;The Room&quot;. These were performed again at The Lincoln Center Festival in July 2001.

In 2001, he played the character of &quot;problem-solver&quot; Jim Napeworth in an episode of &quot;Murder in Mind&quot;, and in 2004 cameoed in &quot;Black Books&quot; as poker-player Dave &#x27;Mouse Ears&#x27; Smith. In 2002 he played the London Records executive Roger Ames in &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, a film about Factory Records and the Manchester music scene. Allen cameoed in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; in a short homage to the Stanley Kubrick film, &quot;The Shining&quot;. He appeared as the villain in the sequel to 2004&#x27;s &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot;, &quot;Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London&quot;, opposite Frankie Muniz. He appeared in the hospital drama, &quot;Bodies&quot;, as Mr Tony Whitman, a sarcastic but somehow likeable consultant obstetrician with an enormous ego. In 2005 he appeared in the Endemol-produced BBC Two television programme &quot;Art School&quot; alongside Ulrika Jonsson, John Humphrys, and Clarissa Dickson Wright where he discovered a passion for painting. From 2006 to 2009, Allen appeared in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; drama series, as the Sheriff of Nottingham.

Allen has also starred in pantomimes, such as an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in 2008, written by Ken Ludwig and directed by Sean Holmes; he took the role of a gritty Long John Silver in the Theatre Royal Haymarket.

In September 2011, he appeared in the BBC six-part drama series &quot;The Body Farm&quot; as DI Hale. 2012 (2013 in the UK) saw the release of the Sara Sugarman comedy film &quot;Vinyl&quot; in which Keith played an ageing rock star who finds himself back in the public eye after his band member fools the music industry into giving them a record deal. In 2013, he played Darren the farmer in episode 1.5 of the comedy drama series &quot;Great Night Out&quot;.

In April 2013, Allen starred in a revival of Richard Bean&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Smack Family Robinson&quot; at The Rose Theatre, Kingston upon Thames.

In January 2021, Allen played serial killer and rapist John Cooper in the ITV 3-part drama, &quot;The Pembrokeshire Murders&quot;. In 2023, Allen appeared as Dai Williams in the BBC crime drama &quot;Steeltown Murders&quot;.

===TV presenter===

Allen presented the TV show &quot;Whatever You Want&quot; in 1982, during the early days of Channel Four and has presented television documentaries for Victor Lewis-Smith&#x27;s Associated-Rediffusion Television Productions: &quot;Little Lady Fauntleroy&quot; (2004), which saw Allen interview Lauren Harries and her family, &quot;You&#x27;re Fayed&quot; (2005) and on &quot;Michael Carroll – King of Chavs&quot; (2006). In 2007 his documentary &quot;Tourette De France&quot; appeared on Channel 4, in which he travelled with a group of Scottish people with Tourette syndrome, including John Davidson, on an AEC Routemaster bus from London to the Parisian hospital where this condition was described by Georges Gilles de la Tourette in 1884. He also presented the British erotic direct-to-video series &quot;Red Tape&quot;.

&quot;Keith Allen Will Burn in Hell&quot; appeared on Channel 4 in June 2007, and showed Allen profiling the controversial Westboro Baptist Church, led by Fred Phelps, and speaking to members of the church and Phelps&#x27;s family. 

Allen presented the &quot;Manchester Passion&quot;, a contemporary retelling of the last few hours in the life of Jesus on Good Friday, 14 April 2006. 

&quot;Keith Meets Keith&quot;, screened on 14 September 2009 on Channel 4, in which Allen tracked down TV chef Keith Floyd. The show contained what turned out to be Floyd&#x27;s final interview for television, as he died of a heart attack on the evening the documentary was screened.

Allen&#x27;s documentary film about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, &quot;Unlawful Killing&quot; was intended for release in 2011. Mohamed Al-Fayed, the film&#x27;s only financial backer, contributed the film&#x27;s £2.5 million budget. Allen argued in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that it detailed a &quot;provable conspiracy after the crash&quot;. It accuses Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret of being &quot;gangsters in tiaras&quot; and Prince Philip of being a &quot;psychopath&quot;. Allen said he refused to make 87 cuts asked for by lawyers to enable the film to be shown in Britain. His film was permanently shelved in 2012 after it became known it could not be screened in the United States as it was impossible to insure it against potential litigation.

===Music===

Allen was a member of London punk band the Atoms in the 1970s, and later Fat Les, a band which also featured artist Damien Hirst and Blur bassist Alex James.

In 1980 he starred as the Devil in a short movie called &quot;Meteor Madness&quot; which featured London psychobilly band The Meteors. The film played in cinemas as the opening to the Two-Tone film &quot;Dance Craze&quot; which was released in February 1981. That was the only time &quot;Meteor Madness&quot; was shown, and it has never been released on video or DVD.

He was also closely associated with the band New Order, directing the video for their 1993 song &quot;Ruined in a Day&quot;, which depicts Allen and the band members immersed in a bizarre game of charades with a group of Buddhist monks. He co-wrote their only UK number one single, &quot;World in Motion&quot;, and occasionally performed with them live, including their headline show at the Reading Festival in 1998. He also appeared in the band&#x27;s DVD &quot;New Order Story&quot;, where he played host to a fictional New Order game show.

Allen appeared as the businessman in the music video to Blur&#x27;s 1995 hit &quot;Country House&quot;.

He has been involved in several other football-related records, including &quot;England&#x27;s Irie&quot; by Black Grape and wrote the lyrics for &quot;Vindaloo&quot; by Fat Les. He also contributed the song &quot;On Me Head, Son&quot; to the film &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;, credited on the soundtrack album to Sporting Les.

==Personal life==
As a guest on &quot;Top Gear&quot; on 9 December 2007, Allen said that claims he had eight children were not true and that he actually has six children by four women. His children include pop singer Lily Allen and actor Alfie Allen with his first wife Alison Owen. He married his second wife, Nira Park, in 1997. After his divorce from Park, Allen became the partner of actress Tamzin Malleson (who starred alongside him in &quot;Bodies&quot;), and the couple had a daughter, Teddie Allen, in 2006. They live in Stroud, Gloucestershire. In 2017, Allen and Malleson opened a diner in Stroud, built with the diner set of &quot;&quot; which Allen recovered after shooting the film.

In the mid-1980s Allen served a 21-day jail sentence in Pentonville Prison after being found guilty of criminal damage at the Zanzibar club in Covent Garden.

Although a staunch socialist, whose political philosophy was influenced by the Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party, Allen has expressed grudging admiration for Conservative Party politicians David Cameron and William Hague.

Allen has on his shoulder a tattoo of Rinka the dog, owned by Norman Scott, which was shot dead during the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He has explained that: &quot;I had the tattoo placed on my arm lest I forget, so I have a history of having suspicions about the establishment and the government and court cases&quot;.

He is a supporter of Fulham Football Club.

<text>Nicholas Lanier, sometimes Laniere (baptised 10 September 1588 – buried 24 February 1666) was an English composer and musician; the first to hold the title of Master of the King&#x27;s Music from 1625 to 1666, an honour given to musicians of great distinction. He was the court musician, a composer and performer and Groom of the Chamber in the service of King Charles I and Charles II. He was also a singer, lutenist, scenographer and painter.

== Biography ==

Nicholas Lanier was a descendant of a French family of royal musicians, the Lanière family, who were Huguenots, and was baptised at Greenwich. His father and grandfather left France to escape persecutions. His aunt, Emilia Bassano, was the daughter of Venetian musicians at the Tudor court and, before her marriage to Alfonso Lanier, had been the mistress to the Lord Chamberlain, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth I, and possibly Henry Wriothesly, Earl of Southampton. Historian A. L. Rowse suggested that she may well have been the famous Dark Lady of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets. The family settled in England in 1561. Nicholas Lanier was the son of Frances Galliardello and John Lanier, who was the son of Nicholas Lanier the Elder, court musician to the French King Henry II. His maternal grandfather was another royal musician, Mark Anthony Galliardello. Nicholas was first taught by his father, John, who played the sackbut. In 1613 he composed a masque for the marriage of the Earl of Somerset jointly with Giovanni Coperario and others.

He also wrote music, sang and made sets for Thomas Campion and Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of Augurs&quot; and &quot;Lovers Made Men&quot;.

In the 1610s, Lanier was appointed as a lutenist to the King&#x27;s orchestra and a singer in the King&#x27;s Consorte from 1625 to 1642. He also sang and played the viola da gamba. Lanier was also appointed as Groom of the Chamber for the Queen&#x27;s Privy Chamber in 1639.

From 1625 he made a series of visits to Italy to collect paintings for King Charles I, including most of the art collection of the Dukes of Mantua. During his travels he heard the new Italian music being written by the likes of Claudio Monteverdi. This led to him being one of the first English composers to introduce monody and recitative to England. It was Lanier who, when his own portrait was painted by the Flemish painter van Dyck in Antwerp, convinced the King to bring van Dyck to England, where van Dyck became the leading court painter. The portrait displays the attitude of studied carelessness, called sprezzatura, recommended in &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot; by Baldassare Castiglione, defined as &quot;a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does or says appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it&quot;. Lanier&#x27;s portrait by van Dyck hangs today in Vienna at the Kunsthistoriches Museum.

In 1626, Lanier became the first composer to hold the title Master of the King&#x27;s Music; an honour given a musician of great distinction. The office of Master of the King&#x27;s Musick is the equivalent to the title of the Poet Laureate. During the Commonwealth of England he lived in the Netherlands, but returned after the Restoration to resume his duties in 1660. When he returned to England, he became music master to Charles II. He made several sceneries, like for example for Ben Jonson&#x27;s Lovers Made Men. There is only one painting which can be identified as being made by Lanier, a self-portrait in the music faculty of Oxford University. Lanier died in 1666 in Greenwich.

<text>Sir Henry Walford Davies (6 September 1869 – 11 March 1941) was an English composer, organist, and educator who held the title Master of the King&#x27;s Music from 1934 until 1941. He served with the Royal Air Force during the First World War, during which he composed the &quot;Royal Air Force March Past&quot;, and was music adviser to the British Broadcasting Corporation, for whom he gave commended talks on music between 1924 and 1941.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Henry Walford Davies was born in the Shropshire town of Oswestry. He was the seventh of nine children of John Whitridge Davies and Susan, &quot;née&quot; Gregory, and the youngest of four surviving sons. His father, although an accountant by profession, was an amateur musician who founded and conducted a choral society at Oswestry and was choirmaster of Christ Church Congregational church: at which Walford was a chorister, and at which Walford&#x27;s siblings, Charlie and Harold, later held the post of organist. Harold Davies was professor of music at the University of Adelaide from 1919 to 1947. In 1882 Walford was accepted as a chorister at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, by the organist, Sir George Elvey.

When his voice broke in 1885 Davies left the choir and later that year was appointed organist of the Royal Chapel of All Saints, Windsor Great Park and was secretary to Elvey&#x27;s successor, Walter Parratt, and Dean (later Archbishop) Randall Davidson. At this time British universities, including Cambridge, awarded &quot;non-collegiate&quot; music degrees to any applicant who could pass the necessary examinations. Davies entered for the Cambridge bachelor of music examinations in 1889, but his exercise (a cantata, &quot;The Future&quot;, to words by Matthew Arnold) failed. With the encouragement of Charles Villiers Stanford, professor of music at Cambridge, Davies made a second attempt; it was successful, and he graduated in 1891.

In 1890 Davies was awarded a scholarship in composition at the Royal College of Music (RCM), London, where he was a student until 1894. His teachers there were Hubert Parry and (for a single term) Stanford for composition, and W. S. Rockstro (counterpoint), Herbert Sharpe (piano) and Haydn Inwards (violin). While still at the RCM he was organist of St George&#x27;s Church, Campden Hill, for three months, and St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho for a year until 1891, when he resigned for health reasons. In the following year was appointed organist of Christ Church, Hampstead; he remained there until 1897, holding the post in tandem for the last two years with an appointment from 1895 as teacher of counterpoint at the RCM in succession to Rockstro, a post that he held until 1903. He considered resigning the post in 1896, when he failed the counterpoint paper in the Cambridge examinations for the degree of doctor of music; he was successful at his second attempt, and the doctorate was conferred in March 1898.
===National reputation===
In May 1898 Davies was appointed organist and director of the choir at the Temple Church in the City of London, a post he retained until 1923. With this appointment, in the view of his biographer, Jeremy Dibble, Davies began to be seen as a prominent figure in British musical life. As an organist he became well known both as a soloist and as a teacher – the most celebrated of his pupils being Leopold Stokowski. As a conductor he directed the London Church Choir Association (1901–13) and succeeded Stanford at the Bach Choir (1902–07).

As a composer Davies achieved his most substantial success in 1904, with his cantata &quot;Everyman&quot;, based on the 15th century morality play of the same name. His friend and biographer H. C. Colles wrote, &quot;[T]he music itself was not like anything he had written before or would write again. &quot;Everyman&quot; was tumultuously received, and in the next few years given by every choral society in the country which aimed at a standard of firstrateness.&quot; The work was also given in Australia and the US.

During the First World War Davies joined the Committee for Music in War Time under Parry&#x27;s chairmanship, organised concerts for the troops in France and musical events for the Fight for Right movement. In 1918 he was appointed director of music of the Royal Air Force, with the rank of major. He established the RAF School of Music (attached to the Guildhall School of Music) and two RAF bands, and composed the &quot;Royal Air Force March Past&quot;, to which a slow &quot;trio&quot; section was later added by his successor, Major George Dyson. Since 1930 Walford Davies&#x27; &quot;Solemn Melody&quot; has been one of the permanent selection of national airs and mourning music performed on Remembrance Sunday at The Cenotaph, Whitehall.

===1919–41===

In 1919 Davies accepted the professorship of music at University College, Aberystwyth, together with the post of director of music for the University of Wales and chairman of the National Council of Music. Here, in the words of his biographer Henry Ley, he &quot;laboured unceasingly for the musical enlightenment of the principality&quot;, and in 1922 he was knighted in David Lloyd George&#x27;s resignation honours.

In 1924 he gave the Cramb lectures at the University of Glasgow, gave his first broadcast talk for the BBC, and was appointed Gresham professor of music at the University of London. In the same year, at the age of fifty-four, he married (Constance) Margaret Isabel Evans (1898–1984), daughter of the Rev William Evans, Rector of Narberth, Pembrokeshire; she was his junior by twenty-eight years.

Davies wrote &quot;God Be in My Head&quot; and several other pieces at Witham Hall, which was the home of a friend. Davies was the godfather of Bridget Lyons, who was the daughter of James W. Webb-Jones of St George&#x27;s School, Windsor Castle, and the wife of the chorister Peter Stanley Lyons, who was subsequently the headmaster of Witham Hall School.

Davies resigned his professorship at Aberystwyth in 1926, when he was appointed by the BBC as a music adviser, but he remained chairman of the National Council of Music until his death. He was from 1927 to 1932 organist and director of St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

Davies&#x27;s BBC broadcast in April 1924 was the first of many he made between then and 1941. He became well known for his programmes &quot;Music and the Ordinary Listener&quot; (1926–9), his wartime broadcasts for children (1939–41), and &quot;Everyman&#x27;s Music&quot; (1940–41). &quot;The Musical Times&quot; called him &quot;one of the world&#x27;s first great broadcasters&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot;, in an obituary tribute said:

Colles wrote that Davies&#x27;s regular listeners felt a proprietorial interest in him, recording one of them as remarking, &quot;He always seemed to come right into the room with us.&quot;

On the death of Sir Edward Elgar in 1934, Davies was appointed to succeed him as Master of the King&#x27;s Music. As musical adviser to the BBC Davies moved from London to Bristol when the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the corporation&#x27;s music administration moved there on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.

Davies died at Wrington, near Bristol, on 11 March 1941, and his ashes were buried in the graveyard of Bristol Cathedral.

<text>Nicholas Staggins (died 13 June 1700) was an English composer.

Staggins first studied music under his father. He was made Master of the King&#x27;s Music by Charles II in 1674. In 1682, he was granted a musical doctorate by Cambridge University, and from 1684 until his death was Professor of Music at Cambridge. Following his death on the night of 12–13 June 1700, he was succeeded by John Eccles.

From the few fragments of his compositions that survive, his musical ability is generally regarded to have been slender. His most significant work was his music for John Crowne&#x27;s masque &quot;Calisto, or The Chaste Nymph&quot;. His other works include odes for the birthdays of William III (in at least 1693, 1694 and 1696). He also wrote incidental music for John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Conquest of Granada&quot; and &quot;Marriage à la Mode&quot;, George Etheridge&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Mode&quot;, Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s &quot;Gloriana&quot;, and Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;Epsom Wells&quot;.

In Tom Brown&#x27;s &quot;Letters from the Dead to the Living&quot;, Staggins is described as &quot;bandy legged and contemptuously regarded&quot;. Following his death he was buried in Woollon on 16 June 1700 at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

<text>Louis Grabu, Grabut, Grabue, or Grebus (fl. 1665 – 1690, died after 1693) was a Catalan-born, French-trained composer and violinist who was mainly active in England.

While he was probably born in Catalonia – he was later referred to as &#x27;Lodovicus Grabeu of Shalon in Catalunnia&#x27; – details of his early life are lacking. Sometime in his youth he moved to Paris, where he was most likely trained by Lully. At the time of the Restoration he went to England, where French music, especially opera, was much in vogue.

Charles II of England appointed him as a composer for his own private music in 1665, and with the death of Nicholas Lanier in 1666 he became the second person to hold the title Master of the King&#x27;s Musick. He adapted Robert Cambert&#x27;s opera &quot;Ariadne&quot; for a London performance in 1674, and wrote music for John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Albion and Albanius&quot; in 1685.

In 1693 he left England, the only land where he had achieved any fame, and completely disappeared from the historical record.

<text>John Eccles (1668 – 12 January 1735) was an English composer.

Born in London, eldest son of professional musician Solomon Eccles and brother of fellow composer Henry Eccles, John Eccles was appointed to the King&#x27;s Private Music in 1694, and in 1700 became Master of the King&#x27;s Musick. In the latter year he finished second in a competition to write music for William Congreve&#x27;s masque &quot;The Judgement of Paris&quot; (the winner was John Weldon).

Eccles was very active as a composer for the theatre, and from the 1690s wrote a large amount of incidental music including music for Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot;, John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Friar&quot; and William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Jointly with Henry Purcell he wrote incidental music for Thomas d&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. He became a composer to Drury Lane theatre in 1693 and when some of the actors broke off to form their own company at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1695, he composed music for them as well including for John Dennis&#x27;s &quot;Rinaldo and Armida&quot;.

Eccles also wrote music for the coronation of Queen Anne and a number of songs. Many of his most famous songs, such as &quot;I burn, I burn&quot; were composed for the actress-singer Anne Bracegirdle to perform. Recognizing Eccles’s ability to write for her needs, Mrs Bracegirdle, undoubtedly under his tutelage, thereafter sang only his music. Eccles also wrote an all-sung English opera &quot;Semele&quot; with text by Congreve, but it was not staged until the 20th century. Congreve&#x27;s libretto would later serve as the basis for Handel&#x27;s &quot;Semele&quot; (1744).

For much of the later part of his life, Eccles lived in Kingston upon Thames and wrote additional incidental music (though not as frequently as he had for Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields) as well as the occasional court ode. He is reported to have spent much of his time fishing.

He was the only Master of the King&#x27;s Musick in the history of the post to serve four monarchs (King William III, Queen Anne, King George I and King George II).

==Modern Editions==
Until recently Eccles’s music has been largely unavailable. Now, however, a modern edition of the works of John Eccles is in progress under the general editorship of Michael Burden, Amanda Eubanks Winkler, Alan Howard and Kathryn Lowerre, and published by A-R Editions. The edition has produced &quot;Music for Macbeth&quot; edited by Amanda Eubanks Winkler; &quot;The Judgement of Paris&quot; edited by Eric Harbeson; &quot;Rinaldo and Armida&quot; edited by Steven Plank; &quot;Incidental Music Part 1&quot; edited by Amanda Eubanks Winkler; and &quot;Europe’s Revels for the Peace of Ryswick&quot; edited by Michael Burden.

Eccles’s major opera, &quot;Semele&quot;, can be found in volume 76 of &quot;Musica Britannica&quot;, edited by Richard Platt.

<doc id="192590" wikidata="Q1087850" url="?curid=192590" title="Parabolic reflector">
<text>A parabolic (or paraboloid or paraboloidal) reflector (or dish or mirror) is a reflective surface used to collect or project energy such as light, sound, or radio waves. Its shape is part of a circular paraboloid, that is, the surface generated by a parabola revolving around its axis. The parabolic reflector transforms an incoming plane wave travelling along the axis into a spherical wave converging toward the focus. Conversely, a spherical wave generated by a point source placed in the focus is reflected into a plane wave propagating as a collimated beam along the axis.

Parabolic reflectors are used to collect energy from a distant source (for example sound waves or incoming star light). Since the principles of reflection are reversible, parabolic reflectors can also be used to collimate radiation from an isotropic source into a parallel beam. In optics, parabolic mirrors are used to gather light in reflecting telescopes and solar furnaces, and project a beam of light in flashlights, searchlights, stage spotlights, and car headlights. In radio, parabolic antennas are used to radiate a narrow beam of radio waves for point-to-point communications in satellite dishes and microwave relay stations, and to locate aircraft, ships, and vehicles in radar sets. In acoustics, parabolic microphones are used to record faraway sounds such as bird calls, in sports reporting, and to eavesdrop on private conversations in espionage and law enforcement.

== Theory ==
Strictly, the three-dimensional shape of the reflector is called a &quot;paraboloid&quot;. A parabola is the two-dimensional figure. (The distinction is like that between a sphere and a circle.) However, in informal language, the word &quot;parabola&quot; and its associated adjective &quot;parabolic&quot; are often used in place of &quot;paraboloid&quot; and &quot;paraboloidal&quot;.

If a parabola is positioned in Cartesian coordinates with its vertex at the origin and its axis of symmetry along the y-axis, so the parabola opens upward, its equation is formula_1, where formula_2 is its focal length. (See &quot;Parabola#In a cartesian coordinate system&quot;.) Correspondingly, the dimensions of a symmetrical paraboloidal dish are related by the equation: where formula_3 is the focal length, formula_4 is the depth of the dish (measured along the axis of symmetry from the vertex to the plane of the rim), and formula_5 is the radius of the dish from the center. All units used for the radius, focal point and depth must be the same. If two of these three quantities are known, this equation can be used to calculate the third.

A more complex calculation is needed to find the diameter of the dish &quot;measured along its surface&quot;. This is sometimes called the &quot;linear diameter&quot;, and equals the diameter of a flat, circular sheet of material, usually metal, which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish. Two intermediate results are useful in the calculation: formula_6 (or the equivalent: and where , , and are defined as above. The diameter of the dish, measured along the surface, is then given by: where formula_7 means the natural logarithm of , i.e. its logarithm to base &quot;e&quot;.

The volume of the dish is given by formula_8 where the symbols are defined as above. This can be compared with the formulae for the volumes of a cylinder formula_9 a hemisphere formula_10 where formula_11 and a cone formula_12 formula_13 is the aperture area of the dish, the area enclosed by the rim, which is proportional to the amount of sunlight the reflector dish can intercept. The area of the concave surface of the dish can be found using the area formula for a surface of revolution which gives formula_14. providing formula_15. The fraction of light reflected by the dish, from a light source in the focus, is given by formula_16, where formula_17 formula_18 and formula_19 are defined as above.

The parabolic reflector functions due to the geometric properties of the paraboloidal shape: any incoming ray that is parallel to the axis of the dish will be reflected to a central point, or &quot;focus&quot;. (For a geometrical proof, click here.) Because many types of energy can be reflected in this way, parabolic reflectors can be used to collect and concentrate energy entering the reflector at a particular angle. Similarly, energy radiating from the focus to the dish can be transmitted outward in a beam that is parallel to the axis of the dish.

In contrast with spherical reflectors, which suffer from a spherical aberration that becomes stronger as the ratio of the beam diameter to the focal distance becomes larger, parabolic reflectors can be made to accommodate beams of any width. However, if the incoming beam makes a non-zero angle with the axis (or if the emitting point source is not placed in the focus), parabolic reflectors suffer from an aberration called coma. This is primarily of interest in telescopes because most other applications do not require sharp resolution off the axis of the parabola.

The precision to which a parabolic dish must be made in order to focus energy well depends on the wavelength of the energy. If the dish is wrong by a quarter of a wavelength, then the reflected energy will be wrong by a half wavelength, which means that it will interfere destructively with energy that has been reflected properly from another part of the dish. To prevent this, the dish must be made correctly to within about of a wavelength. The wavelength range of visible light is between about 400 and 700 nanometres (nm), so in order to focus all visible light well, a reflector must be correct to within about 20 nm. For comparison, the diameter of a human hair is usually about 50,000 nm, so the required accuracy for a reflector to focus visible light is about 2500 times less than the diameter of a hair. For example, the flaw in the Hubble Space Telescope mirror (too flat by about 2,200 nm at its perimeter) caused severe spherical aberration until corrected with COSTAR.

Microwaves, such as are used for satellite-TV signals, have wavelengths of the order of ten millimetres, so dishes to focus these waves can be wrong by half a millimetre or so and still perform well.

==Variations==

===Focus-balanced reflector===
It is sometimes useful if the centre of mass of a reflector dish coincides with its focus. This allows it to be easily turned so it can be aimed at a moving source of light, such as the Sun in the sky, while its focus, where the target is located, is stationary. The dish is rotated around that pass through the focus and around which it is balanced. If the dish is symmetrical and made of uniform material of constant thickness, and if &quot;F&quot; represents the focal length of the paraboloid, this &quot;focus-balanced&quot; condition occurs if the depth of the dish, measured along the axis of the paraboloid from the vertex to the plane of the of the dish, is 1.8478 times &quot;F&quot;. The radius of the rim is 2.7187 &quot;F&quot;. The angular radius of the rim as seen from the focal point is 72.68 degrees.

===Scheffler reflector===
The focus-balanced configuration (see above) requires the depth of the reflector dish to be greater than its focal length, so the focus is within the dish. This can lead to the focus being difficult to access. An alternative approach is exemplified by the Scheffler reflector, named after its inventor, Wolfgang Scheffler. This is a paraboloidal mirror which is rotated about axes that pass through its centre of mass, but this does not coincide with the focus, which is outside the dish. If the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, the focus would move as the dish turns. To avoid this, the reflector is flexible, and is bent as it rotates so as to keep the focus stationary. Ideally, the reflector would be exactly paraboloidal at all times. In practice, this cannot be achieved exactly, so the Scheffler reflector is not suitable for purposes that require high accuracy. It is used in applications such as solar cooking, where sunlight has to be focused well enough to strike a cooking pot, but not to an exact point.

===Off-axis reflectors===
A circular paraboloid is theoretically unlimited in size. Any practical reflector uses just a segment of it. Often, the segment includes the vertex of the paraboloid, where its curvature is greatest, and where the axis of symmetry intersects the paraboloid. However, if the reflector is used to focus incoming energy onto a receiver, the shadow of the receiver falls onto the vertex of the paraboloid, which is part of the reflector, so part of the reflector is wasted. This can be avoided by making the reflector from a segment of the paraboloid which is offset from the vertex and the axis of symmetry. The whole reflector receives energy, which is then focused onto the receiver. This is frequently done, for example, in satellite-TV receiving dishes, and also in some types of astronomical telescope (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the Green Bank Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope).

Accurate off-axis reflectors, for use in solar furnaces and other non-critical applications, can be made quite simply by using a rotating furnace, in which the container of molten glass is offset from the axis of rotation. To make less accurate ones, suitable as satellite dishes, the shape is designed by a computer, then multiple dishes are stamped out of sheet metal.

Off-axis-reflectors heading from medium latitudes to a geostationary TV satellite somewhere above the equator stand steeper than a coaxial reflector. The effect is, that the arm to hold the dish can be shorter and snow tends less to accumulate in (the lower part of) the dish.

== History ==

The principle of parabolic reflectors has been known since classical antiquity, when the mathematician Diocles described them in his book &quot;On Burning Mirrors&quot; and proved that they focus a parallel beam to a point. Archimedes in the third century BCE studied paraboloids as part of his study of hydrostatic equilibrium, and it has been claimed that he used reflectors to set the Roman fleet alight during the Siege of Syracuse. This seems unlikely to be true, however, as the claim does not appear in sources before the 2nd century CE, and Diocles does not mention it in his book. Parabolic mirrors and reflectors were also studied extensively by the physicist Roger Bacon in the 13th century AD. James Gregory, in his 1663 book &quot;Optica Promota&quot; (1663), pointed out that a reflecting telescope with a mirror that was parabolic would correct spherical aberration as well as the chromatic aberration seen in refracting telescopes. The design he came up with bears his name: the &quot;Gregorian telescope&quot;; but according to his own confession, Gregory had no practical skill and he could find no optician capable of actually constructing one. Isaac Newton knew about the properties of parabolic mirrors but chose a spherical shape for his Newtonian telescope mirror to simplify construction. Lighthouses also commonly used parabolic mirrors to collimate a point of light from a lantern into a beam, before being replaced by more efficient Fresnel lenses in the 19th century. In 1888, Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist, constructed the world&#x27;s first parabolic reflector antenna.

== Applications ==
The most common modern applications of the parabolic reflector are in satellite dishes, reflecting telescopes, radio telescopes, parabolic microphones, solar cookers, and many lighting devices such as spotlights, car headlights, PAR lamps and LED housings.
The Olympic Flame is traditionally lit at Olympia, Greece, using a parabolic reflector concentrating sunlight, and is then transported to the venue of the Games. Parabolic mirrors are one of many shapes for a burning glass.

Parabolic reflectors are popular for use in creating optical illusions. These consist of two opposing parabolic mirrors, with an opening in the center of the top mirror. When an object is placed on the bottom mirror, the mirrors create a real image, which is a virtually identical copy of the original that appears in the opening. The quality of the image is dependent upon the precision of the optics. Some such illusions are manufactured to tolerances of millionths of an inch.

A parabolic reflector pointing upward can be formed by rotating a reflective liquid, like mercury, around a vertical axis. This makes the liquid-mirror telescope possible. The same technique is used in rotating furnaces to make solid reflectors.

Parabolic reflectors are also a popular alternative for increasing wireless signal strength. Even with simple ones, users have reported 3 dB or more gains.

<doc id="192594" wikidata="Q1049680" url="?curid=192594" title="Castlereagh (borough)">
<text>Castlereagh ( ) was a local government district with the status of borough in Northern Ireland. It merged with Lisburn City Council in May 2015 under local government reorganisation in Northern Ireland to become Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council, with a small amount being transferred to Belfast City Council.

It was a mainly urban borough consisting mostly of suburbs of Belfast in the Castlereagh Hills (to the south-east of the city) with a small rural area in the south of the borough. Unusually, it had no natural borough centre. The main centres of population are Carryduff, 6 miles (9.6 km) south of Belfast city centre and Dundonald, 5 miles (8 km) east of it.

Castlereagh was named after the barony of Castlereagh, which in turn was named after the townland of same name (from the Irish &quot;An Caisleán Riabhach&quot;, or Grey Castle, a reference to a stronghold of the Clandeboye O&#x27;Neils which stood on a site near what is now an Orange hall on Church Road).

==Creation==
The district was one of twenty-six created on 1 October 1973. It was formed by the amalgamation of the following areas of County Down: most of Castlereagh Rural District, the Carryduff and Newtownbreda areas of Hillsborough Rural District and the Moneyreagh area of North Down Rural District.

==Borough council==

The borough was divided into four electoral areas: Castlereagh Central, South, East and West. In the 2011 elections, 23 members were elected. As of February 2012 the political composition of the council was: 11 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 6 Alliance Party, 3 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 2 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and 1 Green Party councillor. The last election was due to take place in May 2009, but on 25 April 2008, Shaun Woodward, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that the scheduled 2009 district council elections were to be postponed until the introduction of the eleven new councils in 2011. The proposed reforms were abandoned in 2010, and the most recent district council elections took place in 2011

===Mayor of Castlereagh===
In 1977 Castlereagh District Council was granted a charter of incorporation constituting the district as a borough, and creating the office of mayor.

The mayor for the civic year 2013–2014 was councillor David Drysdale (DUP) and the Deputy Mayor was councillor Ann-Marie Beattie (DUP).

==Parliamentary and assembly representation==
The borough was divided between the East Belfast constituency (the wards of Ballyhanwood, Carrowreagh, Cregagh, Downshire, Dundonald, Enler, Gilnahirk, Graham&#x27;s Bridge, Lisnasharragh, Lower Braniel, Tullycarnet and Upper Braniel), the South Belfast constituency (Beechill, Cairnshill, Carryduff East, Carryduff West, Galwally, Hillfoot, Knockbracken, Minnowburn, Newtownbreda and Wynchurch wards) and the Strangford constituency (Moneyreagh ward) for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly.

==Elections 2011==
These elections saw the political landscape at Castlereagh change dramatically. The DUP lost overall control of the council due to the loss of two council seats, one in Central and one in the East. The UUP also lost their sole representative in East. The Alliance Party gained one in East and Central, while the Green Party also gained in East. There were no changes in the West or South areas. There had been much speculation that demographic change would deliver Sinn Féin a seat in South. However, this turned out to be unfounded, with the SDLP being the sixth placed runner up, being narrowly beaten by the UUP for the fifth seat.

==Population==
The area covered by the former Castlereagh Borough Council had a population of 67,272 residents according to the 2011 Northern Ireland census.

<text>Methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) is a group of gram-positive bacteria that are genetically distinct from other strains of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. MRSA is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. It caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide attributable to antimicrobial resistance in 2019.

MRSA is any strain of &quot;S. aureus&quot; that has developed (through natural selection) or acquired (through horizontal gene transfer) a multiple drug resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Beta-lactam (β-lactam) antibiotics are a broad-spectrum group that include some penams (penicillin derivatives such as methicillin and oxacillin) and cephems such as the cephalosporins. Strains unable to resist these antibiotics are classified as methicillin-susceptible &quot;S. aureus&quot;, or MSSA.

MRSA infection is common in hospitals, prisons, and nursing homes, where people with open wounds, invasive devices such as catheters, and weakened immune systems are at greater risk of healthcare-associated infection. MRSA began as a hospital-acquired infection but has become community-acquired, as well as livestock-acquired. The terms HA-MRSA (healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired MRSA), CA-MRSA (community-associated MRSA), and LA-MRSA (livestock-associated MRSA) reflect this.

== Signs and symptoms ==
In humans, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is part of the normal microbiota present in the upper respiratory tract, and on skin and in the gut mucosa. However, along with similar bacterial species that can colonize and act symbiotically, they can cause disease if they begin to take over the tissues they have colonized or invade other tissues; the resultant infection has been called a &quot;pathobiont&quot;.

After 72 hours, MRSA can take hold in human tissues and eventually become resistant to treatment. The initial presentation of MRSA is small red bumps that resemble pimples, spider bites, or boils; they may be accompanied by fever and, occasionally, rashes. Within a few days, the bumps become larger and more painful; they eventually open into deep, pus-filled boils. About 75 percent of CA-MRSA infections are localized to skin and soft tissue and usually can be treated effectively.

== Risk factors ==
A select few of the populations at risk include:
* People with indwelling implants, prostheses, drains, and catheters
* People who are frequently in crowded places, especially with shared equipment and skin-to-skin contact
* People with weak immune systems (HIV/AIDS, lupus, or cancer patients; transplant recipients; severe asthmatics; primary immune deficiencies , etc.)
* Diabetics
* Intravenous drug users
* Regular contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year
* Users of quinolone antibiotics
* Elderly people
* School children sharing sports and other equipment
* College students living in dormitories
* People staying or working in a health-care facility for an extended period of time
* People who spend time in coastal waters where MRSA is present, such as some beaches in Florida and the West Coast of the United States
* People who spend time in confined spaces with other people, including occupants of homeless shelters, prison inmates, and military recruits in basic training
* Veterinarians, livestock handlers, and pet owners
* People who ingest unpasteurized milk
* People who are immunocompromised and also colonized
* People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
* People who have had thoracic surgery

As many as 22% of people infected with MRSA do not have any discernable risk factors.

=== Hospitalized people ===
People who are hospitalized, including the elderly, are often immunocompromised and susceptible to infection of all kinds, including MRSA; an infection by MRSA is called healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (HA-MRSA).
Generally, those infected by MRSA stay infected for just under 10 days, if treated by a doctor, although effects may vary from person to person.

Both surgical and nonsurgical wounds can be infected with HA-MRSA. Surgical site infections occur on the skin surface, but can spread to internal organs and blood to cause sepsis. Transmission can occur between healthcare providers and patients because some providers may neglect to perform preventative hand-washing between examinations.

People in nursing homes are at risk for all the reasons above, further complicated by their generally weaker immune systems.

===Prison inmates and military personnel===
Prisons and military barracks can be crowded and confined, and poor hygiene conditions may proliferate, thus putting inhabitants at increased risk of contracting MRSA. Cases of MRSA in such populations were first reported in the United States and later in Canada. The earliest reports were made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in US state prisons. In the news media, hundreds of reports of MRSA outbreaks in prisons appeared between 2000 and 2008. For example, in February 2008, the Tulsa County jail in Oklahoma started treating an average of 12 &quot;S. aureus&quot; cases per month.

=== Animals ===
Antibiotic use in livestock increases the risk that MRSA will develop among the livestock and other animals that may reside near them; strains MRSA ST398 and CC398 are transmissible to humans. Generally, animals are asymptomatic.

Domestic pets are susceptible to MRSA infection by transmission from their owners; conversely, MRSA-infected pets can also transmit MRSA to humans.

=== Athletes ===
Locker rooms, gyms, and related athletic facilities offer potential sites for MRSA contamination and infection. Athletes have been identified as a high-risk group. A study linked MRSA to the abrasions caused by artificial turf. Three studies by the Texas State Department of Health found the infection rate among football players was 16 times the national average. In October 2006, a high-school football player was temporarily paralyzed from MRSA-infected turf burns. His infection returned in January 2007 and required three surgeries to remove infected tissue, and three weeks of hospital stay.

In 2013, Lawrence Tynes, Carl Nicks, and Johnthan Banks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were diagnosed with MRSA. Tynes and Nicks apparently did not contract the infection from each other, but whether Banks contracted it from either individual is unknown. In 2015, Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Justin Turner was infected while the team visited the New York Mets. In October 2015, New York Giants tight end Daniel Fells was hospitalized with a serious MRSA infection.

=== Children ===
MRSA is becoming a critical problem in children; studies found 4.6% of patients in U.S. health-care facilities, (presumably) including hospital nurseries, were infected or colonized with MRSA. Children and adults who come in contact with day-care centers, playgrounds, locker rooms, camps, dormitories, classrooms and other school settings, and gyms and workout facilities are at higher risk of contracting MRSA. Parents should be especially cautious of children who participate in activities where sports equipment is shared, such as football helmets and uniforms.

=== Intravenous drug users ===
Needle-required drugs have caused an increase of MRSA, with injection drug use (IDU) making up 24.1% (1,839 individuals) of Tennessee Hospital&#x27;s Discharge System. The unsanitary methods of injection causes an access point for the MRSA to enter the blood stream and begin infecting the host. Furthermore, with MRSA&#x27;s high contagion rate, a common risk factor is individuals who are in constant contact with someone who has injected drugs in the past year.

== Mechanism ==
Antimicrobial resistance is genetically based; resistance is mediated by the acquisition of extrachromosomal genetic elements containing genes that confer resistance to certain antibiotics. Examples of such elements include plasmids, transposable genetic elements, and genomic islands, which can be transferred between bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. A defining characteristic of MRSA is its ability to thrive in the presence of penicillin-like antibiotics, which normally prevent bacterial growth by inhibiting synthesis of cell wall material. This is due to a resistance gene, &quot;mecA&quot;, which stops β-lactam antibiotics from inactivating the enzymes (transpeptidases) critical for cell wall synthesis.

=== SCC&quot;mec&quot; ===
Staphylococcal cassette chromosome &quot;mec&quot; (SCC&quot;mec&quot;) is a genomic island of unknown origin containing the antibiotic resistance gene &quot;mecA&quot;. SCC&quot;mec&quot; contains additional genes beyond &quot;mecA&quot;, including the cytolysin gene &quot;psm-mec&quot;, which may suppress virulence in HA-acquired MRSA strains. In addition, this locus encodes strain-dependent gene regulatory RNAs known as &quot;psm-mec&quot;RNA. SCC&quot;mec&quot; also contains &quot;ccrA&quot; and &quot;ccrB&quot;; both genes encode recombinases that mediate the site-specific integration and excision of the SCC&quot;mec&quot; element from the &quot;S. aureus&quot; chromosome. Currently, six unique SCC&quot;mec&quot; types ranging in size from 21 to 67 kb have been identified; they are designated types I–VI and are distinguished by variation in &quot;mec&quot; and &quot;ccr&quot; gene complexes. Owing to the size of the SCC&quot;mec&quot; element and the constraints of horizontal gene transfer, a minimum of five clones are thought to be responsible for the spread of MRSA infections, with clonal complex (CC) 8 most prevalent. SCC&quot;mec&quot; is thought to have originated in the closely related &quot;Staphylococcus sciuri&quot; species and transferred horizontally to &quot;S. aureus.&quot;

Different SCC&quot;mec&quot; genotypes confer different microbiological characteristics, such as different antimicrobial resistance rates. Different genotypes are also associated with different types of infections. Types I–III SCC&quot;mec&quot; are large elements that typically contain additional resistance genes and are characteristically isolated from HA-MRSA strains. Conversely, CA-MRSA is associated with types IV and V, which are smaller and lack resistance genes other than &quot;mecA&quot;.

These distinctions were thoroughly investigated by Collins et al. in 2001, and can be explained by the fitness differences associated with carriage of a large or small SCC&quot;mec&quot; plasmid. Carriage of large plasmids, such as SCC&quot;mec&quot;I–III, is costly to the bacteria, resulting in a compensatory decrease in virulence expression. MRSA is able to thrive in hospital settings with increased antibiotic resistance but decreased virulence – HA-MRSA targets immunocompromised, hospitalized hosts, thus a decrease in virulence is not maladaptive. In contrast, CA-MRSA tends to carry lower-fitness cost SCC&quot;mec&quot; elements to offset the increased virulence and toxicity expression required to infect healthy hosts.

=== &quot;mecA&quot; ===
&quot;mecA&quot; is a biomarker gene responsible for resistance to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. After acquisition of &quot;mecA&quot;, the gene must be integrated and localized in the &quot;S. aureus&quot; chromosome. &quot;mecA&quot; encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), which differs from other penicillin-binding proteins as its active site does not bind methicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics. As such, PBP2a can continue to catalyze the transpeptidation reaction required for peptidoglycan cross-linking, enabling cell wall synthesis even in the presence of antibiotics. As a consequence of the inability of PBP2a to interact with β-lactam moieties, acquisition of &quot;mecA&quot; confers resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics in addition to methicillin.

&quot;mecA&quot; is under the control of two regulatory genes, &quot;mecI&quot; and &quot;mecR1&quot;. MecI is usually bound to the &quot;mecA&quot; promoter and functions as a repressor. In the presence of a β-lactam antibiotic, MecR1 initiates a signal transduction cascade that leads to transcriptional activation of &quot;mecA&quot;. This is achieved by MecR1-mediated cleavage of MecI, which alleviates MecI repression. &quot;mecA&quot; is further controlled by two co-repressors, &quot;blaI&quot; and &quot;blaR1&quot;. &quot;blaI&quot; and &quot;blaR1&quot; are homologous to &quot;mecI&quot; and &quot;mecR1&quot;, respectively, and normally function as regulators of &quot;blaZ&quot;, which is responsible for penicillin resistance. The DNA sequences bound by &quot;mecI&quot; and &quot;blaI&quot; are identical; therefore, &quot;blaI&quot; can also bind the &quot;mecA&quot; operator to repress transcription of &quot;mecA&quot;.

=== Arginine catabolic mobile element ===
The arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) is a virulence factor present in many MRSA strains but not prevalent in MSSA. SpeG-positive ACME compensates for the polyamine hypersensitivity of &quot;S. aureus&quot; and facilitates stable skin colonization, wound infection, and person-to-person transmission.

=== Strains ===

Acquisition of SCC&quot;mec&quot; in methicillin-sensitive &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MSSA) gives rise to a number of genetically different MRSA lineages. These genetic variations within different MRSA strains possibly explain the variability in virulence and associated MRSA infections. The first MRSA strain, ST250 MRSA-1, originated from SCC&quot;mec&quot; and ST250-MSSA integration. Historically, major MRSA clones ST2470-MRSA-I, ST239-MRSA-III, ST5-MRSA-II, and ST5-MRSA-IV were responsible for causing hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) infections. ST239-MRSA-III, known as the Brazilian clone, was highly transmissible compared to others and distributed in Argentina, Czech Republic, and Portugal.

In the UK, the most common strains of MRSA are EMRSA15 and EMRSA16. EMRSA16 has been found to be identical to the ST36:USA200 strain, which circulates in the United States, and to carry the SCC&quot;mec&quot; type II, enterotoxin A and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 genes. Under the new international typing system, this strain is now called MRSA252. EMRSA 15 is also found to be one of the common MRSA strains in Asia. Other common strains include ST5:USA100 and EMRSA 1. These strains are genetic characteristics of HA-MRSA.

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains emerged in late 1990 to 2000, infecting healthy people who had not been in contact with healthcare facilities. Researchers suggest that CA-MRSA did not evolve from HA-MRSA. This is further proven by molecular typing of CA-MRSA strains and genome comparison between CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, which indicate that novel MRSA strains integrated SCC&quot;mec&quot; into MSSA separately on its own. By mid-2000, CA-MRSA was introduced into healthcare systems and distinguishing CA-MRSA from HA-MRSA became a difficult process. Community-acquired MRSA is more easily treated and more virulent than hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). The genetic mechanism for the enhanced virulence in CA-MRSA remains an active area of research. The Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes are of particular interest because they are a unique feature of CA-MRSA.

In the United States, most cases of CA-MRSA are caused by a CC8 strain designated ST8:USA300, which carries SCC&quot;mec&quot; type IV, Panton–Valentine leukocidin, PSM-alpha and enterotoxins Q and K, and ST1:USA400. The ST8:USA300 strain results in skin infections, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome, whereas the ST1:USA400 strain results in necrotizing pneumonia and pulmonary sepsis. Other community-acquired strains of MRSA are ST8:USA500 and ST59:USA1000. In many nations of the world, MRSA strains with different genetic background types have come to predominate among CA-MRSA strains; USA300 easily tops the list in the U.S. and is becoming more common in Canada after its first appearance there in 2004. For example, in Australia, ST93 strains are common, while in continental Europe ST80 strains, which carry SCC&quot;mec&quot; type IV, predominate. In Taiwan, ST59 strains, some of which are resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics, have arisen as common causes of skin and soft tissue infections in the community. In a remote region of Alaska, unlike most of the continental U.S., USA300 was found only rarely in a study of MRSA strains from outbreaks in 1996 and 2000 as well as in surveillance from 2004 to 2006.

A MRSA strain, CC398, is found in intensively reared production animals (primarily pigs, but also cattle and poultry), where it can be transmitted to humans as LA-MRSA (livestock-associated MRSA).

== Diagnosis ==

Diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks of MRSA. Normally, a bacterium must be cultured from blood, urine, sputum, or other body-fluid samples, and in sufficient quantities to perform confirmatory tests early-on. Still, because no quick and easy method exists to diagnose MRSA, initial treatment of the infection is often based upon &quot;strong suspicion&quot; and techniques by the treating physician; these include quantitative PCR procedures, which are employed in clinical laboratories for quickly detecting and identifying MRSA strains.

Another common laboratory test is a rapid latex agglutination test that detects the PBP2a protein. PBP2a is a variant penicillin-binding protein that imparts the ability of &quot;S. aureus&quot; to be resistant to oxacillin.

=== Microbiology ===
Like all &quot;S. aureus&quot; (also abbreviated SA at times), methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; is a gram-positive, spherical (coccus) bacterium about 1 micron in diameter. It does not form spores and it is not motile. It is frequently found in grape-like clusters or chains. Unlike methicillin-susceptible &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MSSA), MRSA is slow-growing on a variety of media and has been found to exist in mixed colonies of MSSA. The &quot;mecA&quot; gene, which confers resistance to a number of antibiotics, is always present in MRSA and usually absent in MSSA; however, in some instances, the &quot;mecA&quot; gene is present in MSSA but is not expressed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the most precise method for identifying MRSA strains. Specialized culture media have been developed to better differentiate between MSSA and MRSA and, in some cases, such media can be used to identify specific strains that are resistant to different antibiotics.

Other strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; have emerged that are resistant to oxacillin, clindamycin, teicoplanin, and erythromycin. These resistant strains may or may not possess the &quot;mecA&quot; gene. &quot;S. aureus&quot; has also developed resistance to vancomycin (VRSA). One strain is only partially susceptible to vancomycin and is called vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VISA). GISA, a strain of resistant&quot; S. aureus&quot;, is glycopeptide-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; and is less suspectible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Resistance to antibiotics in &quot;S. aureus&quot; can be quantified by determining the amount of the antibiotic that must be used to inhibit growth. If &quot;S. aureus&quot; is inhibited at a concentration of vancomycin less than or equal to 4 μg/ml, it is said to be susceptible. If a concentration greater than 32 μg/ml is necessary to inhibit growth, it is said to be resistant.

== Prevention ==
=== Screening ===
In health-care settings, isolating those with MRSA from those without the infection is one method to prevent transmission. Rapid culture and sensitivity testing and molecular testing identifies carriers and reduces infection rates. It is especially important to test patients in these settings since 2% of people are carriers of MRSA, even though in many of these cases the bacteria reside in the nostril and the patient will not present any symptoms.

MRSA can be identified by swabbing the nostrils and isolating the bacteria found there. Combined with extra sanitary measures for those in contact with infected people, swab screening people admitted to hospitals has been found to be effective in minimizing the spread of MRSA in hospitals in the United States, Denmark, Finland, and the Netherlands.

=== Handwashing ===
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers suggestions for preventing the contraction and spread of MRSA infection which are applicable to those in community settings, including incarcerated populations, childcare center employees, and athletes. To prevent the spread of MRSA, the recommendations are to wash hands thoroughly and regularly using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer. Additional recommendations are to keep wounds clean and covered, avoid contact with other people&#x27;s wounds, avoid sharing personal items such as razors or towels, shower after exercising at athletic facilities, and shower before using swimming pools or whirlpools.

=== Isolation ===
Excluding medical facilities, current US guidance does not require workers with MRSA infections to be routinely excluded from the general workplace. The National Institutes of Health recommend that those with wound drainage that cannot be covered and contained with a clean, dry bandage and those who cannot maintain good hygiene practices be reassigned, and patients with wound drainage should also automatically be put on &quot;Contact Precaution,&quot; regardless of whether or not they have a known infection. Workers with active infections are excluded from activities where skin-to-skin contact is likely to occur. To prevent the spread of staphylococci or MRSA in the workplace, employers are encouraged to make available adequate facilities that support good hygiene. In addition, surface and equipment sanitizing should conform to Environmental Protection Agency-registered disinfectants. In hospital settings, contact isolation can be stopped after one to three cultures come back negative. Before the patient is cleared from isolation, it is advised that there is dedicated patient-care or single-use equipment for that particular patient. If this is not possible, the equipment must be properly disinfected before it is used on another patient.

To prevent the spread of MRSA in the home, health departments recommend laundering materials that have come into contact with infected persons separately and with a dilute bleach solution; to reduce the bacterial load in one&#x27;s nose and skin; and to clean and disinfect those things in the house that people regularly touch, such as sinks, tubs, kitchen counters, cell phones, light switches, doorknobs, phones, toilets, and computer keyboards.

=== Restricting antibiotic use ===
Glycopeptides, cephalosporins, and in particular, quinolones are associated with an increased risk of colonisation of MRSA. Reducing use of antibiotic classes that promote MRSA colonisation, especially fluoroquinolones, is recommended in current guidelines.

=== Public health considerations ===
Mathematical models describe one way in which a loss of infection control can occur after measures for screening and isolation seem to be effective for years, as happened in the UK. In the &quot;search and destroy&quot; strategy that was employed by all UK hospitals until the mid-1990s, all hospitalized people with MRSA were immediately isolated, and all staff were screened for MRSA and were prevented from working until they had completed a course of eradication therapy that was proven to work. Loss of control occurs because colonised people are discharged back into the community and then readmitted; when the number of colonised people in the community reaches a certain threshold, the &quot;search and destroy&quot; strategy is overwhelmed. One of the few countries not to have been overwhelmed by MRSA is the Netherlands: an important part of the success of the Dutch strategy may have been to attempt eradication of carriage upon discharge from hospital.

=== Decolonization ===

As of 2013, no randomized clinical trials had been conducted to understand how to treat nonsurgical wounds that had been colonized, but not infected, with MRSA, and insufficient studies had been conducted to understand how to treat surgical wounds that had been colonized with MRSA. As of 2013, whether strategies to eradicate MRSA colonization of people in nursing homes reduced infection rates was not known.

Care should be taken when trying to drain boils, as disruption of surrounding tissue can lead to larger infections, including infection of the blood stream. Mupirocin 2% ointment can be effective at reducing the size of lesions. A secondary covering of clothing is preferred. As shown in an animal study with diabetic mice, the topical application of a mixture of sugar (70%) and 3% povidone-iodine paste is an effective agent for the treatment of diabetic ulcers with MRSA infection.

=== Community settings ===

Maintaining the necessary cleanliness may be difficult for people if they do not have access to facilities such as public toilets with handwashing facilities. In the United Kingdom, the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 require businesses to provide toilets for their employees, along with washing facilities including soap or other suitable means of cleaning. Guidance on how many toilets to provide and what sort of washing facilities should be provided alongside them is given in the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Approved Code of Practice and Guidance L24, available from Health and Safety Executive Books, but no legal obligations exist on local authorities in the United Kingdom to provide public toilets, and although in 2008, the House of Commons Communities and Local Government Committee called for a duty on local authorities to develop a public toilet strategy, this was rejected by the Government.

=== Agriculture ===

The World Health Organization advocates regulations on the use of antibiotics in animal feed to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant strains of MRSA. MRSA is established in animals and birds.

== Treatment ==
=== Antibiotics ===

Treatment of MRSA infection is urgent and delays can be fatal. The location and history related to the infection determines the treatment. The route of administration of an antibiotic varies. Antibiotics effective against MRSA can be given by IV, oral, or a combination of both, and depend on the specific circumstances and patient characteristics. The use of concurrent treatment with vancomycin or other beta-lactam agents may have a synergistic effect.

Both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA are resistant to traditional anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics, such as cephalexin. CA-MRSA has a greater spectrum of antimicrobial susceptibility to sulfa drugs (like co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), tetracyclines (like doxycycline and minocycline) and clindamycin (for osteomyelitis). MRSA can be eradicated with a regimen of linezolid, though treatment protocols vary and serum levels of antibiotics vary widely from person to person and may affect outcomes.
The effective treatment of MRSA with linezolid has been successful in 87% of people. Linezolid is more effective in soft tissue infections than vancomycin. This is compared to eradication of infection in those with MRSA treated with vancomycin. Treatment with vancomycin is successful in approximately 49% of people. Linezolid belongs to the newer oxazolidinone class of antibiotics which has been shown to be effective against both CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends vancomycin, linezolid, or clindamycin (if susceptible) for treating those with MRSA pneumonia.
Ceftaroline, a fifth-generation cephalosporin, is the first beta-lactam antibiotic approved in the US to treat MRSA infections in skin and soft tissue or community-acquired pneumonia.

Vancomycin and teicoplanin are glycopeptide antibiotics used to treat MRSA infections. Teicoplanin is a structural congener of vancomycin that has a similar activity spectrum but a longer half-life. Because the oral absorption of vancomycin and teicoplanin is very low, these agents can be administered intravenously to control systemic infections. Treatment of MRSA infection with vancomycin can be complicated, due to its inconvenient route of administration. Moreover, the efficacy of vancomycin against MRSA is inferior to that of anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam antibiotics against methicillin-susceptible &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MSSA).

Several newly discovered strains of MRSA show antibiotic resistance even to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Strains with intermediate (4–8 μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed glycopeptide-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (GISA) or vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VISA), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France, and the US. The first documented strain with complete (&gt;16 μg/ml) resistance to vancomycin, termed vancomycin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VRSA), appeared in the United States in 2002. In 2011, a variant of vancomycin was tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target, thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity. Linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and tigecycline are used to treat more severe infections that do not respond to glycopeptides such as vancomycin. Current guidelines recommend daptomycin for VISA bloodstream infections and endocarditis.

Oxazolidinones such as linezolid became available in the 1990s and are comparable to vancomycin in effectiveness against MRSA. Linezolid resistance in &quot;S. aureus&quot; was reported in 2001, but infection rates have been at consistently low levels. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, no linezolid resistance was found in staphylococci collected from bacteremia cases between 2001 and 2006.

=== Skin and soft-tissue infections ===
In skin abscesses, the primary treatment recommended is removal of dead tissue, incision, and drainage. More information is needed to determine the effectiveness of specific antibiotics therapy in surgical site infections (SSIs). Examples of soft-tissue infections from MRSA include ulcers, impetigo, abscesses, and SSIs.
In surgical wounds, evidence is weak (high risk of bias) that linezolid may be better than vancomycin to eradicate MRSA SSIs.

MRSA colonization is also found in nonsurgical wounds such as traumatic wounds, burns, and chronic ulcers (i.e.: diabetic ulcer, pressure ulcer, arterial insufficiency ulcer, venous ulcer). No conclusive evidence has been found about the best antibiotic regimen to treat MRSA colonization.

=== Children ===
In skin infections and secondary infection sites, topical mupirocin is used successfully. For bacteremia and endocarditis, vancomycin or daptomycin is considered. For children with MRSA-infected bone or joints, treatment is individualized and long-term. Neonates can develop neonatal pustulosis as a result of topical infection with MRSA. Clindamycin is not approved for the treatment of MRSA infection, but it is still used in children for soft-tissue infections.

=== Endocarditis and bacteremia ===
Evaluation for the replacement of a prosthetic valve is considered. Appropriate antibiotic therapy may be administered for up to six weeks. Four to six weeks of antibiotic treatment is often recommended, and is dependent upon the extent of MRSA infection.

=== Respiratory infections ===
CA-MRSA in hospitalized patients pneumonia treatment begins before culture results. After the susceptibility to antibiotics is performed, the infection may be treated with vancomycin or linezolid for up to 21 days. If the pneumonia is complicated by the accumulation of pus in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs, drainage may be done along with antibiotic therapy. People with cystic fibrosis may develop respiratory complications related to MRSA infection. The incidence of MRSA in those with cystic fibrosis increased during 2000 to 2015 by five times. Most of these infections were HA-MRSA. MRSA accounts for 26% of lung infections in those with cystic fibrosis.

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of topical or systematic antibiotics for nasal or extra-nasal MRSA infection.

=== Bone and joint infections ===
Cleaning the wound of dead tissue and draining abscesses is the first action to treat the MRSA infection. Administration of antibiotics is not standardized and is adapted by a case-by-case basis. Antibiotic therapy can last up to 3 months and sometimes even longer.

=== Infected implants ===
MRSA infection can occur associated with implants and joint replacements. Recommendations on treatment are based upon the length of time the implant has been in place. In cases of a recent placement of a surgical implant or artificial joint, the device may be retained while antibiotic therapy continues. If the placement of the device has occurred over 3 weeks ago, the device may be removed. Antibiotic therapy is used in each instance sometimes long-term.

=== Central nervous system ===
MRSA can infect the central nervous system and form brain abscess, subdural empyema, and spinal epidural abscess. Excision and drainage can be done along with antibiotic treatment. Septic thrombosis of cavernous or dural venous sinus can sometimes be a complication.

=== Other infections ===
Treatment is not standardized for other instances of MRSA infection in a wide range of tissues. Treatment varies for MRSA infections related to: subperiosteal abscesses, necrotizing pneumonia, cellulitis, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, mediastinitis, myocardial, perinephric, hepatic, and splenic abscesses, septic thrombophlebitis, and severe ocular infections, including endophthalmitis. Pets can be reservoirs and pass on MRSA to people. In some cases, the infection can be symptomatic and the pet can develop a MRSA infection. Health departments recommend that the pet be taken to the veterinarian if MRSA infections keep occurring in the people who have contact with the pet.

== Epidemiology ==
Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people carry some form of &quot;S. aureus&quot;; of these, up to 53 million (2.7% of carriers) are thought to carry MRSA. &quot;S. aureus&quot; was identified as one of the six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance in 2019 and 100,000 deaths caused by MRSA were attributable to antimicrobial resistance.

=== HA-MRSA (healthcare associated) ===
In a US cohort study of 1,300 healthy children, 2.4% carried MRSA in their nose. Bacterial sepsis occurs with most (75%) of cases of invasive MRSA infection. In 2009, there were an estimated 463,017 hospitalizations due to MRSA, or a rate of 11.74 per 1,000 hospitalizations. Many of these infections are less serious, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that there are 80,461 invasive MRSA infections and 11,285 deaths due to MRSA annually. In 2003, the cost for a hospitalization due to MRSA infection was US$92,363; a hospital stay for MSSA was $52,791.

Infection after surgery is relatively uncommon, but occurs as much as 33% in specific types of surgeries. Infections of surgical sites range from 1% to 33%. MRSA sepsis that occurs within 30 days following a surgical infection has a 15–38% mortality rate; MRSA sepsis that occurs within one year has a mortality rate of around 55%. There may be increased mortality associated with cardiac surgery. There is a rate of 12.9% in those infected with MRSA while only 3% infected with other organisms. SSIs infected with MRSA had longer hospital stays than those who did not.

Globally, MRSA infection rates are dynamic and vary year to year. According to the 2006 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program report, the incidence of MRSA bloodstream infections was 35.9% in North America. MRSA blood infections in Latin America was 29%. European incidence was 22.8%. The rate of all MRSA infections in Europe ranged from 50% in Portugal down to 0.8% in Sweden. Overall MRSA infection rates varied in Latin America: Colombia and Venezuela combined had 3%, Mexico had 50%, Chile 38%, Brazil 29%, and Argentina 28%.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that about 1.7 million nosocomial infections occurred in the United States in 2002, with 99,000 associated deaths. The estimated incidence is 4.5 nosocomial infections per 100 admissions, with direct costs (at 2004 prices) ranging from $10,500 (£5300, €8000 at 2006 rates) per case (for bloodstream, urinary tract, or respiratory infections in immunocompetent people) to $111,000 (£57,000, €85,000) per case for antibiotic-resistant infections in the bloodstream in people with transplants. With these numbers, conservative estimates of the total direct costs of nosocomial infections are above $17 billion. The reduction of such infections forms an important component of efforts to improve healthcare safety. (BMJ 2007) MRSA alone was associated with 8% of nosocomial infections reported to the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network from January 2006 to October 2007.

The British National Audit Office estimated that the incidence of nosocomial infections in Europe ranges from 4% to 10% of all hospital admissions. As of early 2005, the number of deaths in the United Kingdom attributed to MRSA has been estimated by various sources to lie in the area of 3,000 per year.

In the United States, an estimated 95 million people carry &quot;S. aureus&quot; in their noses; of these, 2.5 million (2.6% of carriers) carry MRSA. A population review conducted in three U.S. communities showed the annual incidence of CA-MRSA during 2001–2002 to be 18–25.7/100,000; most CA-MRSA isolates were associated with clinically relevant infections, and 23% of people required hospitalization.

=== CA-MRSA (community associated) ===
In a US cohort study of 1,300 healthy children, 2.4% carried MRSA in their noses. There are concerns that the presence of MRSA in the environment may allow resistance to be transferred to other bacteria through phages (viruses that infect bacteria). The source of MRSA could come from hospital waste, farm sewage, or other waste water. MRSA is also common in infections of dogs and cats and transmission to humans can occur, since pet owners hug and kiss their pets or let them sleep in their beds. While sharing of isolates can occur, infections in humans seem to originate from HA-MRSA rather than from pet-acquired CA-MRSA.

=== LA-MRSA (livestock associated) ===
In 2004, MRSA was first isolated on a Dutch pig farm leading to further investigations of livestock associated MRSA (LA-MRSA). Livestock associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has been observed in Korea, Brazil, Switzerland, Malaysia, India, Great Britain, Denmark, and China.

== History ==

In 1961, the first known MRSA isolates were reported in a British study, and from 1961 to 1967, infrequent hospital outbreaks occurred in Western Europe and Australia, with methicillin then being licensed in England to treat resistant infections. Other reports of MRSA began to be described in the 1970s. Resistance to other antibiotics was documented in some strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot;. In 1996, vancomycin resistance was reported in Japan. In many countries, outbreaks of MRSA infection were reported to be transmitted between hospitals. The rate had increased to 22% by 1995, and by 1997 the level of hospital &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections attributable to MRSA had reached 50%.

The first report of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) occurred in 1981, and in 1982, a large outbreak of CA-MRSA occurred among intravenous drug users in Detroit, Michigan. Additional outbreaks of CA-MRSA were reported through the 1980s and 1990s, including outbreaks among Australian Aboriginal populations that had never been exposed to hospitals. In the mid-1990s, scattered reports of CA-MRSA outbreaks among US children were made. While HA-MRSA rates stabilized between 1998 and 2008, CA-MRSA rates continued to rise. A report released by the University of Chicago Children&#x27;s Hospital comparing two periods (1993–1995 and 1995–1997) found a 25-fold increase in the rate of hospitalizations due to MRSA among children in the United States. In 1999, the University of Chicago reported the first deaths from invasive MRSA among otherwise healthy children in the United States. By 2004, the genome for various strains of MRSA were described.

The observed increased mortality among MRSA-infected people arguably may be the result of the increased underlying morbidity of these people. Several studies, however, including one by Blot and colleagues, that have adjusted for underlying disease still found MRSA bacteremia to have a higher attributable mortality than methicillin-susceptible &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MSSA) bacteremia.

A population-based study of the incidence of MRSA infections in San Francisco during 2004–05 demonstrated that nearly one in 300 residents had such an infection in the course of a year and that greater than 85% of these infections occurred outside of the healthcare setting. A 2004 study showed that people in the United States with &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection had, on average, three times the length of hospital stay (14.3 vs. 4.5 days), incurred three times the total cost ($48,824 vs. $14,141), and experienced five times the risk of in-hospital death (11.2% vs 2.3%) than people without this infection. In a meta-analysis of 31 studies, Cosgrove &quot;et al.&quot;, concluded that MRSA bacteremia is associated with increased mortality as compared with MSSA bacteremia (odds ratio= 1.93; 95% ). In addition, Wyllie &quot;et al.&quot; report a death rate of 34% within 30 days among people infected with MRSA, a rate similar to the death rate of 27% seen among MSSA-infected people.

In the US, the CDC issued guidelines on October 19, 2006, citing the need for additional research, but declined to recommend such screening.
According to the CDC, the most recent estimates of the incidence of healthcare-associated infections that are attributable to MRSA in the United States indicate a decline in such infection rates. Incidence of MRSA central line-associated blood-stream infections as reported by hundreds of intensive care units decreased 50–70% from 2001 to 2007. A separate system tracking all hospital MRSA bloodstream infections found an overall 34% decrease between 2005 and 2008. In 2010, vancomycin was the drug of choice.

Across Europe, based mostly on data from 2013, seven countries (Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, and Estonia, from lowest to highest) had low levels of hospital-acquired MRSA infections compared to the others, and among countries with higher levels, significant improvements had been made only in Bulgaria, Poland, and the British Isles.

A 1,000-year-old eye salve recipe found in the medieval &quot;Bald&#x27;s Leechbook&quot; at the British Library, one of the earliest known medical textbooks, was found to have activity against MRSA &quot;in vitro&quot; and in skin wounds in mice.

== In the media ==
MRSA is frequently a media topic, especially if well-known personalities have announced that they have or have had the infection. Word of outbreaks of infection appears regularly in newspapers and television news programs. A report on skin and soft-tissue infections in the Cook County jail in Chicago in 2004–05 demonstrated MRSA was the most common cause of these infections among those incarcerated there. Lawsuits filed against those who are accused of infecting others with MRSA are also popular stories in the media.

MRSA is the topic of radio programs, television shows, books, and movies.

== Research ==
Various antibacterial chemical extracts from various species of the sweetgum tree (genus &quot;Liquidambar&quot;) have been investigated for their activity in inhibiting MRSA. Specifically, these are: cinnamic acid, cinnamyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, benzyl cinnamate, styrene, vanillin, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-phenylpropyl alcohol, and 3-phenylpropyl cinnamate.

The delivery of inhaled antibiotics along with systematic administration to treat MRSA are being developed. This may improve the outcomes of those with cystic fibrosis and other respiratory infections. Phage therapy has been used for years in MRSA in eastern countries, and studies are ongoing in western countries. Host-directed therapeutics, including host kinase inhibitors, as well as antimicrobial peptides are under study as adjunctive or alternative treatment for MRSA.

A 2015 Cochrane systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of wearing gloves, gowns and masks to help stop the spread of MRSA in hospitals, however no eligible studies were identified for inclusion. The review authors concluded that there is a need for randomized controlled trials to be conducted to help determine if the use of gloves, gowns, and masks reduces the transmission of MRSA in hospitals.

<doc id="192597" wikidata="Q5192091" url="?curid=192597" title="Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry">
<text>Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry (1739–1821), was a County Down landowner, Irish Volunteer, and member of the parliament who, exceptionally for an Ulster Scot and Presbyterian, rose within the ranks of Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Anglican Ascendancy.&quot; His success was fuelled by wealth acquired through judicious marriages, and by the advancing political career of his son, Viscount Castlereagh (an architect of the Acts of Union, and British Foreign Secretary). In 1798 he gained notoriety for refusing to intercede on behalf of James Porter, his local Presbyterian minister, executed outside the Stewart demesne as a rebel.

== Birth and origins ==
Robert was born on 27 September 1739, at Mount Stewart, the eldest son of Alexander Stewart and his wife Mary Cowan. His father was an alderman of Derry in 1760, and his grandfather, Colonel William Stewart, had commanded one of the two companies of Protestant soldiers that Derry admitted into its walls when Mountjoy was sent there by Tyrconnell before the start of the siege. Robert&#x27;s mother was a daughter of John Cowan, also an alderman of that same town. His parents had married on 30 June 1737 in Dublin.








== Cowan inheritance ==
Within three months of his parents&#x27; marriage in 1737, Robert&#x27;s mother inherited the fortune her half-brother, Robert Cowan, had acquired in service to the East India Company as Governor of Bombay. The legacy allowed Alexander Stewart to retire from the linen trade and buy into the landed gentry. In 1743 he purchased sixty townlands and a large estate from the Colville family at Newtownards and Comber in County Down.

== Education and first marriage ==
Robert Stewart was brought up a Calvinist, sent by his father under the care of a tutor to the University of Geneva, where he studied literature. He thus &quot;temptations of Oxford and similar academic strongholds of the Established Church&quot; to which, as the son landed gentry, he might naturally have been drawn.

On his return from the continent, he courted Lady Sarah Frances Seymour-Conway (whose niece, Mary Moore, married Robert&#x27;s brother Alexander in 1791). Lady Sarah Frances Seymour-Conway&#x27;s father, Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford, owned considerable property in the neighbourhood of Lisburn, and in 1765 was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Robert Stewart attended the viceregal court in Dublin, where he successfully pressed his suit. The marriage took place in the Chapel Royal of Dublin Castle, and Lord Hertford housed the new couple in the city.
Robert and Sarah had two sons:
#Alexander-Francis, who died within his first year
#Robert (1769–1822), later to be known as &quot;Castlereagh&quot;, the famous statesman

Lady Sarah died in childbirth in 1770.

== Opposition member of parliament ==
The year following his wife&#x27;s death Robert Stewart entered the Irish House of Commons as member for County Down filling a vacancy created by the elevation of Bernard Ward to the House of Lords as Baron Bangor. He was returned by the &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;county&quot; interest backed by the local Whigs and by his fellow Presbyterians (&quot;Dissenters&quot; from the Established Church who were a majority among the county&#x27;s exceptionally high number of freeholder voters). Their discomforted rivals were the &quot;official&quot; or &quot;court&quot; party of the Earl of Hillsborough, the county&#x27;s Lord-Lieutenant and largest proprietor.

This political triumph over the interests of an Ascendancy family which had hitherto returned both county members to the Irish House of Commons formed the prelude of a long period of rivalry. Robert Stewart&#x27;s initial success was largely due to popular sympathy with John Wilkes and the discontented American colonists, and to the growing feelings in favour of constitutional and parliamentary reform which found expression in the Volunteer movement.

He proved a consistent antagonist of the administration, invariably voting and sometimes speaking for the Opposition in the House. His early political conduct won the approval of his constituents. A dinner at which they entertained in Belfast was marked by toasts &quot;liberal in quality as in quantity&quot;, including to &quot;The memory of John Hampden&quot; (who had led parliamentary opposition to Charles I), and to &quot;All those who would rather die in jack-boots than live in wooden shoes&quot;.

== Second marriage and children ==
Robert Stewart remarried, on 7 June 1775, taking for his second wife, Frances Pratt, the independent-minded daughter of the Whig politician Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden.
From his second marriage he had 11 more children, three sons and eight daughters:
#Charles William (1778–1854), succeeded him as 3rd Marquess
#Frances Ann (1777–1810), married Lord Charles Fitzroy
#Elizabeth Mary (1779–1798)
#Caroline (1781–1860), married Col. Thomas Wood MP
# Alexander John (1783–1800)
#Georgiana (1785–1804), married the politician George Canning, 1st Baron Garvagh, nephew of army general and politician Brent Spencer
#Selina Sarah Juliana (1786–1871), David Guardi Ker MP for Downpatrick
#Matilda Charlotte (1787–1842), married Edward Michael Ward, the eldest son of the Robert Ward of Bangor
#Emily Jane (1789–1865), married firstly John James, son of Sir Walter James James, 1st Baronet, and secondly Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge
# Thomas Henry (1790–1810)
#Octavia (1792–1819), married Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough

== Irish Volunteer==
Between 1775 and 1783, Robert Stewart lived in Bangor with his wife, while his father was living at Mount Stewart.

In 1776, a general election was held in Ireland. Robert Stewart stood again for Down and was re-elected. He sat until the dissolution of this parliament on 25 July 1783.

Stewart participated in the Irish Volunteers, the self-armed militia ostensibly formed to maintain order and defend Ireland while the Crown and its forces were distracted by the American War. Following the raid on Belfast Lough by the American privateer John Paul Jones in April 1778, Stewart organised a volunteer company in Newtownards of 115 men, the Arms Independents, to act as fencibles, but which, like other companies, were soon engaged in patriotic debate.

Alexander Stewart, died on 2 April 1781 and as his heir he moved into the family seat, Mount Stewart, near Newtownards (where in the park he completed the Temple of the Winds). On 17 September 1782 he was sworn to the Irish Privy Council.

That very same month as Colonel Stewart he was elected president of the second Ulster (overwhelmingly Presbyterian) Volunteer Convention in Dungannon.

Anticipating a &quot;grand national convention&quot; called for Dublin in November, it notably failed to broaden the front against the Ascendancy. Resolutions in support of Catholic enfranchisement were rejected.

In the general election of October Stewart stood again for County Down but the Ascendancy families triumphed, one seat taken by Arthur Hill, the son of the Earl of Downshire, the other by Lord Bangor&#x27;s son, Edward Ward. Stewart unsuccessfully challenged the returns at the bar of the House of Commons claiming irregularities. Downshire&#x27;s influence was able to procure the dismissal of his petition with costs&quot;.

At the Dublin convention, Stewart was appointed chairman of the committee &quot;for the receiving and digesting plans of reform&quot;. But the convention tactic did not succeed as in 1781, when the massed ranks of the Volunteers had helped secure Irish legislative independence. The digested bill, presented by Henry Flood, which would have abolished the proprietary boroughs (with which their Ascendancy rivals, but not the Stewarts, were endowed) and extended the vote to a broader class of Protestant freeholders was rejected. Having accepted defeat in America, Britain could again spare troops for Ireland, and neither parliament nor Dublin Castle would again be intimidated.

Although he believed that the demands of Dissenters for greater representation should have been met so as to dissuade them from pushing Catholic claims along with their own, Stewart joined his friend, president of the convention, the Earl of Charlemont in urging the Volunteers to receive their rebuff quietly.

==Ascendant peer==
In 1789 Robert Stewart was created Baron Londonderry in the Peerage of Ireland. Unable as a peer to himself avenge his defeat in 1783, for general election of 1790 he took his eldest son, Robert, out of Cambridge University to run for the county. Still able to persuade Down&#x27;s Forty-shilling freeholders that the Stewarts were the friends of reform, the younger Stewart did so successfully albeit at considerable expense to his father.

Stewart deserted Presbyterianism for the Established Church, at what point is unclear but likely in advance of his elevation in 1795 to Viscount Castlereagh and the following year to Earl of Londonderry. His eldest son, now Viscount Castlereagh, also quietly converted to Anglicanism and was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland to serve under Lady Frances&#x27;s brother, Earl Camden, the Lord Lieutenant. Londonderry&#x27;s second son, Charles, meanwhile kept the family present in the Irish Commons as member for Thomastown borough, County Kilkenny. Banking on these new establishment connections, and alarmed by the evident disaffection of their tenantry, Stewart reached an accommodation with the Hills: the families in future would divide the two county seats in Down, each returning a nominee to the parliament in Dublin unopposed.

Following a theft of gunpowder and grapeshot in Donaghdee, on 26 September 1796, Londonderry summoned his tenants to Mount Stewart to compel them to sweat as oath of allegiance. To the extent that he and his sons were prepared to consider reform, including further rights for Catholics, it was now to be within the more secure context of a union with Great Britain. When in 1799 the parliament in Dublin rejected the bill for the Union they fought to have it re-presented.

With the bill&#x27;s final passage, in 1801, Londonderry become one of the 28 original Irish representative peers in the new United Kingdom parliament at Westminster. In 1816, thanks to the advancing career of Castlereagh as Foreign Secretary, he was further elevated to Marquess of Londonderry. He thus achieved the rare feat of rising from a &quot;Dissenting&quot; (Presbyterian) commoner into the highest ranks of the Irish aristocracy.

== 1798, the execution of James Porter ==
During their three-day &quot;Republic&quot; in Ards and north Down, 10–13 June 1798, the United Irish insurgents briefly occupied Mount Stewart. In August, the wife of the local Presbyterian minister, James Porter, appeared at the house with her seven children where they overwhelmed Lady Londonderry and young sister, then dying of tuberculosis, with a plea for his life. One of the children was later to recount that when Londonderry discovered his wife composing a letter to General Nugent, he insisted she add a postscript: &quot;L does not allow me to interfere in Mr Porter&#x27;s case. I cannot, therefore, and beg not to be mentioned. I only send the letter to gratify the humour&quot;, i.e. to placate the distraught Mrs Porter to whom, with a smile that filed her with &quot;much horror&quot;, Londonderry then handed the letter.

Londonderry was himself present at the court martial which had accepted dubious testimony to the minister&#x27;s presence among the rebels, and was to see the sentence executed. Porter was hanged in sight both of his own meeting house at Greyabbey and of his family home (with Stewart tenants reportedly defying their landlord&#x27;s wish that they attend). The Presbyterian minister Rev. Henry Montgomery of Killead, County Antrim, would later describe the circumstances of Porter&#x27;s execution as being of &quot;extreme cruelty towards both himself and his family, which were altogether unnecessary for any purpose of public example&quot;.

Londonderry was content that other offenders should be allowed exile. David Bailie Warden who commanded north Down rebels in the field; the Reverend Thomas Ledlie Birch, a United Irish firebrand who rallied with the rebels after the Battle of Saintfield; and William Sinclair who joined the tenantry in swearing loyalty before Londonderry yet served on the rebel Committee of Public Safety, were all permitted passage to the United States.

Porter&#x27;s offence may have been his popular satire of the local landed interest, &quot;Billy Bluff&quot;, in which the master of Mount Stewart is clearly recognisable as the inarticulate tyrant &quot;Lord Mountmumble&quot;. Porter had been aware that &quot;Billy Bluff&quot; might not go unpunished, acknowledging in its preface: &quot;I am in danger of being hanged or put in gaol, perhaps both&quot;.

It may also be that Londonderry believed that Porter, who had been close to the family (their election agent and a frequent visitor to the Mount Stewart), had been a source of his wife&#x27;s wayward, and potentially compromising, political sympathies. Lady Frances is rumoured to have continued to send privately for Porter&#x27;s offending paper, the &quot;Northern Star,&quot; and in correspondence with Jane Greg (reputedly &quot;head of the United Irish] Female Societies&quot; in Belfast) made bold to identify herself as a &quot;republican countess&quot;.

Local tradition has it that Mrs. Porter waylaid his lordship&#x27;s carriage, in a vain hope of prevailing by a further direct entreaty, but Londonderry bade the coachman &quot;drive on.&quot; The sentence, however, was mitigated by remission of the order for quartering.

== Reputation as landlord ==
Despite political differences with his tenants, Londonderry did have a reputation as a comparatively generous landlord. He and his father rarely evicted tenants unless they were more than five years in arrears, and they abided by the Ulster custom of tenant right. They patronised the local town of Newtownards raising a subscription for a Catholic primary school as a gesture of ecumenical good will, and building a market house with a striking clock tower (a building which occupied by Scottish Fencibles was attacked by the rebels under Warden&#x27;s command in 1798). During food shortages in 1800 and 1801, Londonderry at his own expense imported provisions into the stricken districts.

== Death, succession, and timeline ==
Lord Londonderry died on 6 April 1821 at Mount Stewart, County Down, and was buried at the Newtownards Priory, where his father already had been laid to rest. He was succeeded briefly as the 2nd Marquess of Londonderry by his eldest son Robert (Castlereagh) who took his own life the following year.
