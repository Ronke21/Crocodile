<text>La Trobe University is a public research university based in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Its main campus is located in the suburb of Bundoora. The university was established in 1964, becoming the third university in the state of Victoria and the twelfth university in Australia. La Trobe is one of the Australian verdant universities and also part of the Innovative Research Universities group.

La Trobe&#x27;s original and principal campus is located in the Melbourne metropolitan area, within the northern Melbourne suburb of Bundoora. It is the largest metropolitan campus in the country, occupying over . It has two other major campuses located in the regional Victorian city of Bendigo and the twin border cities of Albury-Wodonga. There are two smaller regional campuses in Mildura and Shepparton and a city campus in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD on Collins Street and in Sydney on Elizabeth Street.

La Trobe offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses across its ten schools.

==History==

The university was established in 1964 following the assent of the &quot;La Trobe University Act&quot; by Victorian Parliament on 9 December 1964. The passing of the Act of Victorian Parliament to establish La Trobe University followed earlier University Acts to establish the University of Melbourne (1853) and Monash University (1958). The Minister of Education at the time and the appointed planning council were &quot;unanimous in their enthusiasm that the new institution should be innovative in its approach&quot;, and the university adopted an academic structure based on schools of studies (rather than on faculties) and a collegiate format, where a large number of students lived on campus. At this time, Flinders University and Macquarie University were also establishing a schools-based system.

Many prominent Victorians were involved in La Trobe&#x27;s establishment process, and there was a strong belief that it was important to increase research and learning in Victoria. One of the major individuals involved was Davis McCaughey, who later became Governor of Victoria. The university was named after Charles Joseph La Trobe, the first Governor of Victoria, and the university motto, &#x27;whoever seeks shall find&#x27;, is adapted from Charles La Trobe&#x27;s family motto. The La Trobe University Coat of Arms incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, the Australian wedge-tailed eagle to represent Australia, and sprigs of heath to represent Victoria.

=== Origins===

The origins of La Trobe can be traced back to the post-World War II era when÷ there emerged a global recognition of the need to increase facilities for higher education. In 1957 the prime minister, Sir Robert Menzies, established a special committee to report on the future of Australian universities, inviting Sir Keith Murray, chairman of the University Grants Committee of Great Britain, to chair it. The Murray Committee, in a far-reaching report submitted in September 1957, recommend a major expansion of university facilities in Australia and changes in administration and financing.

As a direct consequence of the key recommendations of the Murray report, the federal government established the Australian Universities Commission (AUC) in 1959, appointing Sir Leslie Martin as its chair. Menzies appointed Martin to chair a special committee in 1961 to report to the AUC on the rapidly increasing demands for higher education in Australia. In August 1963 it released its second report, which recognised the urgency of Victoria&#x27;s situation, stating that &quot;the resources of Melbourne]] and Monash Universities are not likely to meet the long-term demands for university education beyond 1966. The Commission therefore is willing to support in the 1964–1966 triennium the extension of university facilities in the Melbourne metropolitan area.&quot; Following the recommendations the federal government passed the Universities Assistance Bill in October 1963, providing a grant for a &quot;third&quot; university for recurrent expenditure in 1965 of $106,000 and $210,000 in 1966. The first capital grant was for 1966 and amounted to $1,000,000. These grants were to be matched by equivalent state grants.

===Establishment===

==== Third University Committee ====

In April 1964, Sir Archibald Glenn was invited by the Victorian premier, Sir Henry Bolte, to chair a &quot;Third University Committee&quot;. In addition to Glenn, 13 other members were announced on 21 May 1964. The committee, therefore, consisted of:
* Sir Archibald Glenn, chairman and managing director, ICI Australia Ltd, &quot;Chairman&quot;
* F. H. Brookes, assistant director of education in Victoria
* Sir John Buchan, architect and chairman of Buchan, Laird &amp; Buchan
* Sir Michael Chamberlin, deputy chancellor of Monash University
* Sir Thomas Cherry, president of the Australian Academy of Science 1961-65
* Kathleen Fitzpatrick, formerly associate professor of history at University of Melbourne
* J. A. Hepburn, chief planner at the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works
* Ethleen King, president of the Free Kindergarten Union and former president of the National Council of Women
* Phillip Law, director of the Antarctic Division, Department of External Affairs
* C. E. Newman, solicitor, Numurkah, Victoria
* J. D. Norgard, general manager (operations), BHP
* W. C. Radford, director of the Australian Council for Educational Research
* R. Selby Smith, professor of education at Monash University and principal of Scotch College, Melbourne, 1953–64
* Russel G. French, secretary of the committee

The terms of reference of the committee were to advise the government on all matters concerning the establishment of a third Victorian university. This consisted of &quot;the selection of the site, the preparation of a detailed development program, planning and calling tenders for buildings, the formulating of an administrative structure, the appointment of an Academic Planning Board and the recruitment of key staff.&quot; It was planned that La Trobe would enrol students, if possible, in March 1967.

==== Selecting the site ====

The first meeting of the committee occurred on 2 June 1964 in the rooms of the Historical Society of Victoria on Victoria Street. From there, they acted promptly in seeking out a suitable metropolitan location, inspecting 27 sites from a list of 57 possibilities.

The main constraints facing all options were area – &quot;adequate for a full and balanced university&quot;; cost – preferably Crown owned land, as private land would require large compensation payments; and locality – somewhere reasonably close to the demographic centre of Melbourne (calculated to be in the Camberwell area) and to public transport.

A subcommittee, headed by Phillip Law, quickly recognised that &quot;somewhere on the eastern side of Melbourne stands out as the right location&quot;, however, Monash was already growing in the southeastern suburbs so an alternative area was sought. An early list of possibilities read:

&quot;Outer&quot; – Bundoora, Lilydale.
&quot;Inner&quot; – Burnley Horticultural College, Wattle Park, Caulfield Racecourse, Kew Mental Asylum

Selection of an inner site was unlikely, as they were mostly &quot;either inadequate or unattainable, especially the racecourse&quot;, however, the Kew site was a real possibility.

The &quot;ultimate choice&quot; was unanimously agreed upon by the end of July, resulting in the farm attached to the Mont Park Asylum. Cunningham Dax, head of the Mental Health Authority, was &quot;most co-operative&quot;, although he raised concerns that the loss of the farm would be serious for the hospital. An alternative site for the farm was procured a little further out on Plenty Road, resolving the issue.

==== Naming the university ====

While it was an interesting interpretation of a &quot;local name&quot;, La Trobe, proposed by Fitzpatrick, was agreed unanimously upon by the planning committee after some alternatives, such as Deakin, were &quot;thoughtfully put aside&quot;. Victorian State Parliamentarians, however, were far from unanimous when they came to debate the La Trobe University Bill.

Sir Archibald Glenn, chairman of the committee, provided a concise summary as to why La Trobe was chosen:

&quot;Lieutenant-Governor Charles Joseph La Trobe has great historic significance for Victoria and his name is recognised internationally. La Trobe was not a university man... but he appears to have had almost every quality, one would desire in one. He had a lively interest in every aspect of life of the community, the will to work for the good of other men, and a sense of responsibility towards prosperity.&quot;

The Victorian Minister for Education, Sir John Bloomfield, upon presenting the enabling bill to the Victorian parliament, reflected on the influence of Charles La Trobe in the foundation of the University of Melbourne over 100 years before, concluding &quot;my most satisfying reflection at this moment is that my father&#x27;s father sought for gold in our hills, and he knew this city in the days of the man whom, at the behest of others, I am now trying to acknowledge. If Providence and this Parliament will it, my son&#x27;s son may be taught in his aura and tradition.&quot;

Although La Trobe, like his father, used &quot;La Trobe&quot; and &quot;Latrobe&quot; interchangeably, the committee selected the spelling that was predominantly used by his side of the family.

==== Interim council ====

Following the passing of the &quot;La Trobe University Act&quot;, the interim council was established in December 1964. Aside from Sir Michael Chamberlin and Kathleen Fitzpatrick, who indicated they were unavailable, all members of the Third University Committee were appointed to the interim council, with Sir Archibald Glenn remaining as chairman. Additional members of the interim council were:

* Keith Aickin, barrister
* Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, Nobel Prize for Medicine 1960, Professor of Experimental Medicine and Director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, president of the Australian Academy of Science 1965-69
* J. Andrews, Professor of Geography, University of Melbourne,
* Bernard Callinan, consulting engineer and commissioner of the SEC.
* Michael Clarke, representing Northern Province, Victorian Legislative Council
* John Galbally, barrister, representing Melbourne North and Opposition Leader, Victorian Legislative Council
* Davis McCaughey, Master of Ormond College, University of Melbourne
* Joe Rafferty, representing Ormond, Victorian Legislative Assembly
* Peter Thwaites, principal of Geelong College
* David Myers, vice-chancellor (&quot;ex officio&quot;). 

Sir Thomas Cherry died late in 1966, prior to the final meeting of the interim council. All other members automatically became members of council upon its establishment with the first meeting held on 19 December 1966. It was this meeting that Sir Archibald was elected as chancellor of the university.

=== La Trobe eras ===

The concept of the &quot;La Trobe eras&quot; was first coined by William Breen and John Salmond in the university&#x27;s 25th anniversary history, &quot;Building La Trobe University: Reflections on the first 25 years 1964–1989&quot;. It is used to refer to La Trobe in periods of 25 years, following the year of establishment in 1964 rather than the year of opening in 1967. As of 2015, La Trobe is currently in its third era.

=== First era: 1964–1989 ===
La Trobe University was officially opened by the Victorian premier, Sir Henry Bolte, on 8 March 1967 at a ceremony that was attended by a number of dignitaries including former Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies. Teaching commenced at the Bundoora campus in the first semester of that year, with some 500 students. La Trobe was seen to be unique amongst Australian universities due to its school-based and collegiate structure. At the time, &quot;this novel approach became commonly known in the university as &#x27;The La Trobe Concept&#x27;&quot;. Within four years, however, this format had all but broken down, with the collegiate ideal reduced to halls of residence and the schools becoming departmentalised.

Up until the late 1980s, La Trobe focused almost exclusively on the liberal arts and the sciences. In 1987 the Lincoln Institute of Health Sciences merged with the university. The Lincoln Institute had begun as Lincoln House, after the building was bought by the government in 1966, with its formal constitution being established in December 1972. Lincoln House comprised professional training schools for occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy, all of which were affiliated with the Victoria Institute of Colleges. Lincoln Institute thus became the university&#x27;s Faculty of Health Sciences, offering several professional health science programs.

=== Second era: 1990–2014 ===

The university established other professional schools, including its law school in 1992, which was previously a legal studies department established in 1972. In 2008, Victoria&#x27;s second dentistry school was established at La Trobe. However, despite being a leading Australian university in professional health and biomedical sciences, La Trobe does not have a medical school. When planned and developed in the 1960s, there was strong expectation that La Trobe would eventually establish a medical school and a teaching hospital.

The Bendigo campus of La Trobe dates back to 1873: the Bendigo College of Advanced Education amalgamated with La Trobe University in 1991, completing a process that began in the late 1980s as part of the Dawkins reforms to higher education. During the merger process, a controversial issue erupted when the university&#x27;s head office in Bundoora raised concerns about the academic standards at Bendigo CAE. This led to a public outcry in which Bendigo CAE students threatened the &quot;Bendigo Advertiser&quot; over publishing the matter in its newspapers. Several newspapers were burned in the protest.

The inclusion of the Wodonga Institute of Tertiary Education took place in the same year. The university has continued to expand, with the opening of the Research and Development Park at Bundoora and the upcoming opening of a second Melbourne CBD site.

====Funding and cutbacks====
Higher education reforms by the Howard government allowed Australian universities to increase fees and take in a greater number of full-fee paying students. Despite a large student backlash, La Trobe took advantage of the reforms, increasing fees by 25% in 2005. Around the same time, the university suffered cutbacks in government funding, a problem experienced across most of the Australian higher education sector.

La Trobe has lost funding disproportionately across its departments. For instance, the History Department at the university was once by far the largest of any institution in Australia; however, funding restrictions have led to a significant reduction in its size. Similarly, in 1999, the Music Department was closed due to funding cuts; in 2004 the Geology Department was excised even though it had the highest graduate satisfaction rating in the country. The university&#x27;s African Research Institute, the only major African studies centre in Australasia, was closed at the end of 2006. In 2008, the university cut the Philosophy and Religious Studies Program at the Bendigo campus, the change resulted in the stream only being taught as a minor.

In 2008, La Trobe was operating with a $1.46 million surplus but has highlighted that by 2010 it will &quot;review, and where appropriate, restructure all academic, administrative and committee structures&quot; to deal with diminished student intakes, falling entrance marks, below-par scores on student satisfaction surveys and a decreasing proportion of national research funding. In an attempt to address these issues, the university is making cut backs and restructuring several courses under the direction of the Vice-Chancellor, John Dewar. As of 2013, the university is operating on a 28 million dollar surplus.

=== Third era: 2015–present ===

In 2015, La Trobe University committed to fully divest from fossil fuels, after a campaign by students and faculty. The university later committed in 2019 to become fully carbon neutral in its own operations by 2029.

====COVID-19 pandemic====

In 2020, La Trobe University had its operations substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, part of the Bundoora campus had to be closed for a deep clean after a student tested positive for the disease. The university remained open for a time, until the health advice from the Department of Health and Human Services indicated the university should close - although a limited number of courses eventually continued in a face-to-face teaching mode. Classes not run face-to-face were continued online.

This, combined with a reduction in international student enrolments, purportedly weakened the university&#x27;s financial position - although the extent to which this occurred is debated. Reports circulated that La Trobe University risked exhausting its cash reserves unless a deal was with reached with financial institutions or the federal government but the university has stated that it was not at risk of insolvency. A range of measures were proposed or taken to improve the university&#x27;s finances including voluntary redundancies, and staff pay cuts. La Trobe had applied for access to the Australian government wage subsidy program, JobKeeper, but it was deemed ineligible.

Other steps taken by the university in response to the pandemic include: opening up new pathways for student enrolment that do not require an ATAR, removing failing grades from student transcripts and offering new short courses.

==Campuses and buildings==

===Melbourne (Bundoora)===

The Melbourne campus at Bundoora is the foundation campus of La Trobe and was officially opened in 1967 when La Trobe began operations. The campus is the main base of all La Trobe&#x27;s main courses except education, pharmacy, and dentistry, all of which are based at Bendigo. Bundoora is the largest university campus in the Southern Hemisphere, encompassing , including the adjacent Nangak Tamboree Wildlife Sanctuary.

Bundoora has around 22,000 students on campus and therefore has many facilities such as restaurants, bars, shops, banks and an art gallery. The main library on the campus, the Borchardt, has well over one million volumes.

The original main campus buildings were designed by Melbourne architecture firm, Yuncken Freeman in a utilitarian, Post-War International style. These buildings are connected by a series of raised walkways. La Trobe University has three on-campus residential colleges: Menzies, Glenn and Chisholm. These are complemented by the newer North and South Apartments, the self-contained Barnes Way and Waterdale Apartments and the University Lodge, which primarily serves postgraduate students.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, La Trobe University had developed plans to transform the Bundoora campus into a &#x27;City of the Future&#x27;, closely co-locating commercial, cultural and research facilities onto the site.

====On-campus facilities====

The Bundoora campus is home to the La Trobe University Medical Centre and La Trobe Private Hospital.

Bundoora also has sporting and recreation facilities such as an indoor pool, gyms, playing fields, and indoor stadiums. A-League franchise Melbourne City have constructed a $15 million training facility on the campus grounds. Prior to the construction of its new training facilities, the Essendon Football Club had trained at La Trobe University during the summer. Additionally the Sport Program exists to assist student athletes.

The university is also home to the Centre for Dialogue, an interdisciplinary research institution which delves into certain intercultural and inter-religious conflicts, both in the domestic setting and in international relations. In March 2009, the centre attracted controversy in hosting a lecture given by former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami (1997–2005). Khatami emphasised the importance of dialogue between civilizations, especially in relation to quelling misunderstandings between the Islamic world and the West.
The Centre for Dialogue has also received attention for its leadership programme for young Muslims, implemented predominantly in Melbourne&#x27;s northern suburbs.

====Research and Development Park====
The R&amp;D Park opened in 1993, adjacent to the Melbourne (Bundoora) campus. Tenants include a branch of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, the Victorian State Forensic Centre, a Rio Tinto Group research centre, Victorian Environment Protection Authority (EPA), the Co-operative Research Centre for Vaccine Technology, CAVAL, AgriBio and the Technical Enterprise Centre (a business incubator for new ventures in information technology, biotechnology and the life sciences).

===Melbourne (CBD)===

La Trobe has a city campus in Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, on Collins Street. The campus delivers postgraduate courses for both domestic and international students.

====Bouverie Centre====
The Bouverie Centre (first known as the Collins Street Clinic) was established as a clinical mental health service for children and adolescents. In 1956, the centre was renamed the Bouverie Clinic following its relocation from Collins Street, in the CBD of Melbourne to Bouverie Street, Carlton. The Bouverie Centre made the transition from a child psychiatric clinic to the first family therapy centre in Australia in the mid-1970s. In 2007 the Bouverie Centre moved into a $5 million, state government-funded, purpose-built building at 8 Gardiner Street, Brunswick.

La Trobe University took over the management of the Bouverie Centre from the Mental Health Branch of the Victorian Department of Human Services, and added to Bouverie&#x27;s name the subtitle Victoria&#x27;s Family Institute. In the decades that followed, the range of clinical academic courses offered by Bouverie expanded and to date, the Centre delivers a number of Graduate Certificate programs, including the Graduate Certificate in Narrative Therapy; a program specifically tailored for professionals working with people impacted by Acquired Brain Injury seeking to enhance their skill and confidence in working with families, and the nationally recognised Graduate Certificate in Family Therapy for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Workers. The centre&#x27;s Master&#x27;s level program and higher degree research program are a regular feature on the academic calendar.

The Bouverie Centre has over 40 staff, with clinical staff typically working across a number of different service areas.

===Regional and interstate campuses===

====Bendigo====
La Trobe Bendigo succeeded 118 years of tertiary education in the regional centre, which began with the Bendigo School of Mines in 1873.

La Trobe Bendigo was established in 1991, initially as the La Trobe University College of Northern Victoria (1991–1994). Between 1994 and 2005, La Trobe Bendigo&#x27;s curriculum was operated by a multidisciplinary Faculty of Regional Development and was separate from that of Melbourne. Campuses could choose to offer individual courses from both Bundoora and Bendigo. This situation ceased in 2005 after the Bendigo campus was more tightly integrated into the Melbourne campus structure.

 the Bendigo campus is situated on of land, consisting of four sites—Edwards Road, Osbourne Street, the art centre and the La Trobe Rural Health School.

The main site of the Bendigo campus, near Edwards Road, was established in 1967 under the Bendigo Institute of Technology (1967–1976).

The Osbourne Street site was established in 1959 under the Bendigo Teacher&#x27;s College (1926–73). It is now predominantly used for examination facilities and is home to the La Trobe University Bendigo Athletics Track. Some of the facilities used in the 2004 Commonwealth Youth Games were located at La Trobe University Bendigo. There is also the associated Central Victorian Innovation Park, located on university land, which opened in December 2003.

Together these two sites near Edwards Road and Osbourne Street form the Flora Hill campus precinct. They were acquired by La Trobe University in 1991 after an amalgamation with the Bendigo College of Advanced Education (1976–1991).

There are two schools and an art centre in Bendigo:
*La Trobe Rural Health School
*La Trobe Tech School
*The La Trobe Art Institute is a contemporary art centre comprising galleries, a studio for residencies, and venues for hire to the public. The Institute is responsible for the university&#x27;s seven art collections across all of the Victorian campuses.

==== Albury–Wodonga ====

La Trobe University&#x27;s Albury–Wodonga Campus is located three kilometres from the centre of Wodonga on a site. South of the Murray River, the campus is located in Victoria, but within 10 kilometres of the NSW town of Albury and within 20 kilometres of Charles Stuart University&#x27;s NSW-based Albury–Wodonga campus.

La Trobe University&#x27;s presence in Albury–Wodonga began in 1991, within the facilities of the Wodonga Institute of TAFE. The Albury-Wodonga campus continues to share various resources with Wodonga TAFE, including the David Mann Library. This campus houses the faculties of education, health sciences, biology, business as well as the John Richards Centre for Rural Ageing Research and the Centre for Freshwater Ecosystems.

In 2020, the university announced plans to shift almost half of the courses offered at the campus online, while guaranteeing the campus would remain open.

====Mildura====

The Mildura Campus was established in 1996, co-located with the main campus of the Sunraysia Institute of TAFE. These institutions and other tertiary education and research institutions on the site share various resources. A second Mildura City campus opened in 2006 in the old Mildura Cultivator offices, next to &quot;Gallery 25&quot;, an art gallery which La Trobe became involved with a few years earlier.

====Shepparton====
The Shepparton campus was established in 1994. A new two-storey campus building at 210 Fryers Street, opposite the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE was opened in late 2010. Originally the revamped campus building was meant to open in early 2008, but funding delays pushed the project back.

====Sydney====

Located at 255 Elizabeth Street, near Hyde Park, the Sydney campus is centrally located and offers courses in business, accounting and informational technologies, as well as some bridging and enabling courses.

====Partnerships and the e-campus====

In 2007, the university announced plans to open &quot;learning nodes&quot; co-located with the Wangaratta and Seymour campuses of Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE, and at the Swan Hill campus of Sunraysia Institute of TAFE.

La Trobe University also offers an &quot;online&quot; campus, where students can access and participate in classes online through the university&#x27;s learning management system.

===Former campuses===

The Hotel and Conference Centre at Beechworth closed on 23 May 2011. This decision followed stakeholder consultation and feedback about the proposed closure from local businesses and the community. The Beechworth site was once home to the Beechworth Lunatic Asylum, founded in 1867 and later renamed &quot;Mayday Hills Hospital&quot;. The hospital ceased operation in 1995.

==Governance and structure==

===University council===

The principal governing body of the university is the university council. The council is composed of the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, the chair of the academic board, three persons elected by and from the staff of the university, two persons elected by and from the enrolled students of the university, six persons appointed by the governor in council, one person appointed by the minister administering the act and six other persons appointed by the council.

==== Chancellor and vice-chancellor ====
The current chancellor and chair of the university council is John Brumby, since 29 March 2019.

The vice-chancellor is the chief executive officer of the university (Section 26 of the act) and is responsible to the council for the discharge of his or her powers, functions and duties. Theo Farrell was appointed to a 12-year term as vice-chancellor in February 2024. Farrell is a leading scholar of the Afghan and previously acted as strategic advisor to the UK government, the US-led command in Kabul and participated in track II peace talks with the Taliban. John Dewar, former provost of the University of Melbourne, was vice-chancellor of La Trobe University from January 2012 to January 2024. Dewar is an internationally known family law specialist and researcher.

===Constituent schools===
The university is made up of 10 schools, offering courses at all levels:

* School of Agriculture, Biomedicine and Environment
* School of Allied Health, Human Services and Sport
* School of Business 
* School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematical Sciences
* School of Education
* School of Humanities and Social Sciences
* School of Law
* School of Nursing and Midwifery
* School of Psychology and Public Health
* La Trobe Rural Health School

==Academic profile==
La Trobe University is a member of the Innovative Research Universities, an Australian group that collectively receives over $340 million in research grants.

La Trobe University has been confirmed as one of Australia&#x27;s leading research universities, climbing to third in Victoria, based on the Excellence in Research Australia (ERA) 2012 report. La Trobe is the top ranked institution in the nation for research in microbiology and equal top with just one other university in biochemistry and cell biology and in veterinary sciences. Historical studies and archaeology were also both assessed at the top ranking.

The ERA 2012 report shows La Trobe University has made very significant improvements over the past two years, with the number of fields of research in specific disciplines rated at world standard or above (ERA 3 – 5) rising by 31 per cent, from 29 to 38 in 2012. The increase in the publications rated at &#x27;well above&#x27; world standard has increased from about 400 to about 1800, which is more than 300%.

The results are in line with the research investment strategy in research physical infrastructure such as the LIMS and AgriBio projects, and will inform further development of research concentration. This will be important to ensure further improvement in research quality and output in the university in line with the strategic plan.

In August 2019, the university announced the &quot;Shah Rukh Khan La Trobe University PhD Scholarship,&quot; which would provide an opportunity for a female researcher from India to contribute to her field via a four-year PhD degree in one of the following fields: health, sport, information technology, cyber security or engineering. Khan&#x27;s Meer Foundation, which supports and empowers Women, is in recognition of the scholarship, which will provide an estimated $200,000 (AUD) worth of support to the student for a four-year research stay at La Trobe&#x27;s Melbourne campus.

=== Research and publications ===
The 2018 Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) report found that La Trobe&#x27;s research was rated &#x27;At world standard&#x27;, &#x27;Above world standard&#x27; or &#x27;Well above world standard&#x27; across all broad and detailed disciplinary areas.

=== Research divisions ===

==== La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science ====

The La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS) is an interdisciplinary research institute based at the university. It contains research groups in life sciences (biochemistry and genetics), physical sciences (chemistry and physics), and applied sciences (pharmacy) and teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in these areas through the School of Molecular Sciences. It also contains two biotech companies: Hexima and AdAlta. The institute is housed in three buildings: LIMS1 and LIMS2 in the centre of the university&#x27;s main campus in Bundoora and the applied science building at the Bendigo campus.

==== Centre for Research on Language Diversity ====
The Centre for Research on Language Diversity is a research institute founded in 1998 by R. M. W. Dixon at the Australian National University under the name &quot;Research Centre for Linguistic Typology&quot;. It moved to La Trobe University in 2000.

=== Research facilities ===

==== AgriBio ====
In 2004 the Victorian Government identified a need to collocate its primary industries department&#x27;s plant and animal science research capabilities with other research entities. It committed funds for this purpose in 2005 and committed to a joint venture with La Trobe University to construct a bioscience research centre at its Bundoora campus. A key objective of AgriBio is to facilitate science collaboration between the university and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (previously DEPI).

The La Trobe AgriBio building, on the south eastern side of the university, has grown into a structure of around 31,000 square metres and over three levels with a number of external buildings under construction such as a large glasshouse and poly-house complex. Construction commenced in May 2009 and was completed in August 2012.

==== Australian Archaeomagnetism Laboratory ====
In 2011 the university, in conjunction with the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences built the Australian Archaeomagnetism Laboratory (TAAL), based within the Department of Archaeology, Environment and Community Planning. The main aim and focus of research in the laboratory is promoting the use of magnetic methods of analysis (palaeomagnetism, rock magnetism, archaeomagnetic dating and magnetostratigraphy) for understanding the age, palaeoenvironmental/climate context and site formation history of archaeological and fossil sites. The laboratory also undertakes other research with the Department of Physics, including comparative work at the Australian Synchrotron.

In 2011 the laboratory was involved in dating the age of the new South African hominin species &quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot;, which was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot;.

=== Galleries and collections ===

La Trobe began collecting artworks in the early 1960s before beginning construction on the main campus at Bundoora. Master architect of La Trobe Roy Simpson initiated the commissioning of paintings to establish the art collection, and large sculptures were included in the original design. The collection was established at the Melbourne (Bundoora) campus in 1967, and from the late 1970s, various exhibition spaces came and went. In 2010 the Melbourne collection consisted of more than 3000 post-war contemporary Australian artworks valued at $17 million; the second largest university art collection in Victoria in terms of collection value.

The La Trobe University Museum of Art (LUMA), which was located at Glenn College, Melbourne campus, from 1990 to 2016, managed the University Art Collection. It hosted exhibitions, managed the sculpture park (which includes a controversial upside-down statue of Governor La Trobe by sculptor Charles Robb) was managed by LUMA., and collaborated with significant state, national and international projects.

The Visual Arts Centre (VAC) opened in 2005 at 121 View Street, Bendigo. It held public lectures, hosted artist residencies and exhibited cutting-edge work in the visual arts. The Phyllis Palmer Gallery was also situated at Bendigo.

==== La Trobe Institute ====
, the university&#x27;s collection is managed by the La Trobe Institute (LAI), which was established in 2013 to build upon and rationalise the existing university framework of art collections and activities. In 2016 LAI assumed responsibility for LUMA and VAC, which were fully integrated into the LAI structure in 2017. It is based at the old VAC location, but is also active on all of the university campuses, participating in various collaborative projects

The LAI acquires the winning work in the Australian Muslim Artists Art Prize each year, since the university entered into an educational partnership with the Islamic Museum of Australia, which included sponsoring the prize as well as the possibility of providing training in Islamic cultures for teachers, adding a new component to journalism courses and &quot;work-integrated learning opportunities&quot;.

==Student life==

===Student union===
The former La Trobe University Students&#x27; Union was responsible for the Eagle Bar, Contact Student Services but its role has been considerably diminished as a consequence of Voluntary Student Unionism. There used to be three main student representative bodies on campus known as the La Trobe University Student Guild, the Student&#x27;s Representative Council and the La Trobe Postgraduate Student&#x27;s Association. The La Trobe University Student Representative Council, became the principal representative body on campus and a student advocacy group as well as student representatives for welfare, disability, women, queer, indigenous, environment, education and welfare and the Guild managed student services. In 2011 however, the Student&#x27;s Representative Council, the La Trobe Postgraduate Students Association, the Students Guild and the university merged the three separate organisations into one body: the La Trobe Student Union.

The largest faculty-based student representative organisation on campus is the Law Students Association (LSA). Postgraduate students are represented in the new union. The students at the Bendigo campus are represented by the Bendigo Student Association (BSA), a much less activist and political organisation than the student union. The BSA publishes the &quot;3rd Degree&quot; magazine.

=== Student newspaper ===

==== &quot;Rabelais&quot; ====
&quot;Rabelais Student Media&quot; was a student newspaper at La Trobe University, named after French Renaissance writer François Rabelais. From its founding in 1967, Rabelais Student Media has been run as a department of the La Trobe University Student Representative Council (subsequently by the former La Trobe Student Union). The paper was funded by a combination of advertising revenue and a student levy. Editors were elected annually and serve for a single year.

Notably it was the subject of a Federal Court case after the Office of Film and Literature Classification ruled in 1995 that it &quot;promotes, incites and instructs in matters of crime&quot; because of an article on shoplifting (reprinted from elsewhere). This decision was later reviewed by the High Court of Australia.

===Sports and athletics===
La Trobe University is one of 36 universities across Australia that is part of the Elite Athlete Friendly University Network. The network was established by the Australian Sports Commission in 2004 to identify, promote and support the specific needs of university students who participate in sport at an elite level. As a result, an Elite Athlete Friendly University (EAFU) program was developed and formulated.

In 2011 La Trobe University was the reigning champion at the Southern University Games, having won the competition in 2010.

The Sports Centre at the Melbourne campus has a fully equipped gym, squash/racquetball and tennis courts, volleyball, badminton, indoor soccer, netball and basketball courts, a 25-metre pool with a deep water pit, and dance and yoga studios. The centre also offers group exercise classes, dance classes, pilates and yoga. Tuition in most sports can be arranged and courts can be hired to students at discounted rates. The centre also offers deep tissue and trigger point sports massage. La Trobe University participates in the annual Australian University Games A-League association football (soccer) club Melbourne City have their training and administrative facilities based at La Trobe University.

==== Fight song ====
The university song is the tune of Marche Henri IV. The melody is originally from Cassandre by Thoinot Arbeau. There are many university chants that are sung at matches which vary between the sports clubs. The most common chant that is used by La Trobe teams is &quot;LT Who? LTU!&quot;.

Other student-run activities include the La Trobe International Relations Associations.

===Residential colleges===
The following colleges and halls are based at the Melbourne (Bundoora) campus:
*Chisholm College (undergraduate)
*Glenn College (undergraduate)
*Menzies College (undergraduate)
*University Lodge (postgraduate and mature-age)
*Graduate House (graduate and mature-age)

==Notable people==
==Controversies==
Roz Ward, an academic at the university&#x27;s Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society (ARCSHS), co-founded a Safe Schools program for Victoria. The program aims to reduce homophobic and transphobic bullying and discrimination in schools. Research work undertaken by ARCSHS into same-sex attracted and gender diverse youth has helped underpin the program. This program has created controversy. At a national symposium, Ward said, &quot;When people do complain then school leadership can very calmly and graciously say, &#x27;You know what? We&#x27;re doing it anyway, tough luck&#x27;! . . .&#x27;(It&#x27;s) not about celebrating diversity; not about stopping bullying, (It&#x27;s) about gender and sexual diversity&quot;. The Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) and others have criticised the program as &quot;radical sexual experimentation&quot; which &quot;exposed students to extreme material&quot; and asked for the withdrawal of $8 million allocated to the Australia-wide program. ACL says the program instructs students how to use facilities that match gender identities, how to have anal sex and how girls can bind their chests to change gender.

On 16 March 2016, ABC news reported that a Liberal Nationals MP, George Christensen, had used parliamentary privilege to accuse the Safe Schools program of being linked to a &quot;paedophilia advocate&quot;, referring to a professor, Gary Dowsett, and a report he published in 1982. A spokesman for La Trobe University stated: &quot;We are appalled that a respected academic has been attacked using parliamentary privilege. This is a blatant attempt to distract attention from the independent endorsement of the highly effective Safe Schools program. We stand by the important work of Professor Dowsett and his team.&quot;

In May 2016, the Victorian Government reignited its feud with Canberra over the controversial Safe Schools program, announcing it will publicly provide material about sexual diversity that had been deleted from the federal government&#x27;s website, and an additional $300,000 a year to deliver the program in full.

A children&#x27;s story book, promoted by the Safe Schools Coalition, released in January 2016 and titled &quot;The Gender Fairy&quot;, explains transgender issues for children as young as four. Ward compiled the accompanying notes for teachers and parents.

Ward was suspended in June 2016 over comments she made about the Australian flag in a Facebook post, amid concerns her comments had the potential to inflame opinion about the Safe Schools program. The suspension was soon lifted, along with a statement: &quot;La Trobe said it was not in the university&#x27;s best interest to pursue the matter, but that it followed the proper procedures to suspend Ms Ward.&quot;

=== Sexual assault and abuse ===
In 2017 La Trobe was reported as the worst university in Victoria for sexual harassment according to the Australian Human Rights Commission&#x27;s national survey on campus abuse. Of the 947 La Trobe students surveyed, 30% stated they had been sexually harassed at university. Under a previous 2016 FOI request, the university had stated there were only 7 officially reported cases of sexual assault, harassment or misconduct on campus, resulting in no expulsions and no suspensions over the previous five years.

<text>The Young and the Restless (often abbreviated as Y&amp;R) is an American television soap opera created by William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell for CBS. The show is set in the fictional Genoa City (named after the real-life Genoa City, Wisconsin). First broadcast on March 26, 1973, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; was originally broadcast as half-hour episodes, five times a week. The show expanded to one-hour episodes on February 4, 1980. On March 17, 2006, the series began airing previous episodes weeknights on Soapnet until its closure on December 31, 2013, after which the series moved to TVGN (now Pop). From July 1, 2013 until 2019, Pop aired previous episodes on weeknights. The series is also syndicated internationally.

&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; originally focused on two core families: the wealthy Brooks family and the working class Foster family. After a series of recasts and departures in the early 1980s, all the original characters except Jill Foster Abbott were written out. Bell replaced them with new core families, the Abbotts and the Williamses. Over the years, other families such as the Newman family, the Barber/Winters family, and the Baldwin-Fishers were introduced. Despite these changes, one of its most enduring storylines was the four-decade feud between Jill Abbott and Katherine Chancellor, the longest rivalry on any American soap opera.

Since its television debut, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; has won 11 Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Drama Series. It is also currently the highest-rated daytime drama on American television, a rank it has held for 34 years as of the end of the 2021–22 season. As of 2008, it had appeared at the top of the weekly Nielsen ratings in that category for more than 1,000 weeks since 1988. As of December 12, 2013, according to Nielsen ratings, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; marked an unprecedented 1,300 weeks, or 25 years, as the highest-rated daytime drama. The serial is also a sister series to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, as several actors have crossed over between shows. The serial aired its 13,000th episode on November 13, 2024. On February 27, 2024, the series was renewed by CBS to run through the 2027–2028 television season.

Some well-known celebrities got their jumpstart on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, including Eva Longoria, David Hasselhoff, Tom Selleck, Paul Walker, and Shemar Moore. Many other celebrities have made guest appearances on the show, including Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, Wayne Gretzky, Il Divo, and Enrique Iglesias.

==History==
To compete with the youthful ABC soap operas, &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, CBS executives wanted a new daytime serial that was youth oriented. William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell created &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 1972 for the network under the working title, &quot;The Innocent Years!&quot; &quot;We were confronted with the very disturbing reality that young America had lost much of its innocence,&quot; Bell said. &quot;Innocence as we had known and lived it all our lives had, in so many respects, ceased to exist.&quot; They changed the title of the series to &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; because they felt it &quot;reflected the youth and mood of the early seventies.&quot; The Bells named the fictional setting for the show after the real Genoa City, Wisconsin, a community on U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin along the Illinois-Wisconsin state line located between their then-home in Chicago and their annual summer vacation spot in Lake Geneva.

&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; began airing on March 26, 1973, replacing the canceled soap opera, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;. Bell worked as head writer from the debut of the series until his retirement in 1998. He wrote from his home in Chicago while production took place in Los Angeles, California. Originally, Bell wanted to shoot the series in New York City; however, CBS executives felt that Los Angeles would be more cost effective. John Conboy acted as the show&#x27;s first executive producer, staying in the position until 1982. Bell and H. Wesley Kenney became co-executive producers that year, with Edward J. Scott assuming the position in 1989. Bell then became senior executive producer. Other executive producers included David Shaughnessy, John F. Smith, Lynn Marie Latham, Josh Griffith, Maria Arena Bell, and Paul Rauch.

In the mid-1980s, Bell and his family moved to Los Angeles to create a new soap opera. During this time, his three children, William Jr., Bradley Bell, and Lauralee Bell, each became involved in soap operas. Lauralee Bell worked as an actress on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Bradley Bell co-created &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; with his father. William Bell Jr. became involved in the family&#x27;s production companies as president of Bell Dramatic Serial Co. and Bell-Phillip Television Productions Inc. &quot;It&#x27;s worked out very well for us because we really all worked in very different aspects of the show,&quot; William Bell Jr. said. &quot;With my father and I, it was a great kind of partnership and pairing in the sense that he had a total control of the creative side of the show and I didn&#x27;t have even the inclination to interject in what he was doing.&quot;

After William J. Bell&#x27;s 1998 retirement, a number of different head writers took over the position, including Kay Alden, Trent Jones, John F. Smith, Lynn Marie Latham, Scott Hamner, Josh Griffith, Maria Arena Bell, and Hogan Sheffer.

In 2012, former &quot;General Hospital&quot; executive producer Jill Farren Phelps was hired as the new executive producer of the soap, replacing Bell. Griffith was also named the sole head writer. On August 15, 2013, it was speculated and reported by several online sources that Griffith had resigned as head-writer of the serial. Further speculation adds that Shelly Altman may take over as the new scribe, alongside Tracey Thomson or Jean Passanante may be brought aboard as co-head scribe. On September 12, 2013, it was announced that Passanante and Altman were named head writers of the show, with Thomson promoted to co-head writer.

On September 18, 2014, former &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; head writer Charles Pratt Jr. was named as the new head writer of the show. Passanante, Altman and Thomson have been demoted to breakdown writers. Pratt was also named as co-executive producer sharing the credit with Phelps. On June 7, 2016, Serial Scoop announced that Phelps had been terminated from her position as executive producer; a replacement was not named at the time of their reporting. The following morning, Sony Pictures Television confirmed to several list of soap opera media outlets that Phelps had been let go from her position; British television producer Mal Young was announced as Phelps&#x27; replacement. Phelps&#x27; last appearance as executive producer was July 12, 2016, while Young&#x27;s first appearance occurred the following day on July 13. On September 13, 2016, it was announced that Pratt was named as executive producer and show-runner of Lee Daniels&#x27; &quot;Star&quot;. The same day, Daytime Confidential revealed that former &quot;Generations&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; head writer Sally Sussman, who previously had positions with the show, such as Associate Head Writer, was in-talks to replace Pratt as Head Writer. On September 15, 2016, it was confirmed that Sussman was named as the soap&#x27;s new head writer.

On September 21, 2016, Daytime Confidential reported that after ten years since leaving the soap, Alden had been re-hired to be a story consultant under Sussman&#x27;s regime. Sussman&#x27;s tenure as head writer began taping on October 20, 2016, and began airing on December 7, 2016. On June 20, 2017, CBS announced its decision to renew the serial for three years. On July 31, 2017, it was announced that both Alden and Sussman would retire from their positions; Young was named as Sussman&#x27;s successor as head writer. Sussman last aired as head writer on October 24, 2017. Young&#x27;s tenure as head writer aired on October 25, 2017. In December 2018, Young announced his decision to leave the serial, citing that it was a &quot;good time to move on&quot;, and cited his desire to pursue his own project. Anthony Morina was announced as executive producer, while Griffith was named co-executive producer and head writer.

On January 30, 2020, CBS announced it had renewed the serial through 2024. In a statement, CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a remarkable achievement and a testament to the extraordinary cast, gifted writers, talented producers and supremely passionate fans, as well as our tremendous partnership with [&quot;Y&amp;R&quot; studio] Sony Pictures Television.&quot;

On March 20, 2020, after 32 years and over 1,500 consecutive weeks, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; was no longer the number-one soap opera in the United States, having been dethroned by &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful,&quot; which took 33 years since its 1987 debut to attain that position. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; then reclaimed the number-one spot the following week. On April 20, 2020, CBS announced plans to begin airing a week of vintage episodes, following the soap&#x27;s shutdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic; production on the soap would resume in the summer of 2020. On December 1 of the same year, the serial aired its 12,000th episode. On August 19, 2021, it was reported that actress Briana Thomas had filed a lawsuit against Sony Pictures Television and CBS Studios, alleging sexual harassment on the set from showrunner Tony Morina.

On September 29, 2022, a day before the premiere of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;’ 50th season, the show announced that they would be producing showcasts, an audio form of the show’s episodes. Episodes of the showcast will be available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and Stitcher.

On October 9, 2024, it was announced Scott would return to the soap as a senior producer. The serial will air its 13,000th episode on November 13 of the same year, barring preemption.

==Production==
===Videotaping and broadcasting===
Taped at CBS Television City, studios 41 and 43 in Hollywood since its debut on March 26, 1973, the show was packaged by the distribution company Columbia Pictures Television, which has now been replaced by Sony Pictures Television. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; originally aired as a half-hour series on CBS and was the first soap opera to focus on the visual aspects of production, creating &quot;a look that broke with the visual conventions of the genre.&quot; Similar to the radio serials that had preceded them, soap operas at the time primarily focused on dialogue, characters, and story, with details like sets as secondary concerns. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; stood out by using unique lighting techniques and camera angles, similar to Hollywood-style productions. The style of videotaping included using out-of-the-ordinary camera angles and a large number of facial close-ups with bright lighting on the actors&#x27; faces. Conboy said he used lighting to create &quot;artistic effects&quot;. Those effects made the series look dark, shadowy, and moody. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;&#x27; look influenced the taping styles of other soap operas. When H. Wesley Kenney replaced Conboy as executive producer, he balanced the lighting of the scenes.

Due to the success of the series, CBS and its affiliates pressured Bell to lengthen the series from 30 minutes to a full hour. Bell attributed the show&#x27;s fall from number one in the Nielsen ratings to this change, since the lengthening of the show led to the departure of a number of cast members. &quot;The issue of performing in a one-hour show had not been part of their contracts,&quot; Bell said. This forced the show to recast multiple main characters and eventually phase out the original core families in favor of new ones. The show expanded to one hour on February 4, 1980, replacing the long-running serial &quot;Love of Life.&quot; On June 8, 1981, it moved to 12:30 p.m. Eastern, the slot occupied by &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; since its premiere in 1951, which ultimately led to the latter show moving to NBC after a disastrous experiment in another timeslot, alienating that program&#x27;s loyal viewers. It airs 11:00 a.m. on most stations in the Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones, usually as a lead-in to the local noon news for most CBS stations outside the Eastern Time Zone (though some stations in the Central Time Zone opt to air it at 11:30 a.m.).

Exteriors used in the late 1980s and early 1990s (and reused years later) included locations in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, including Allegheny General Hospital, One Oxford Centre, the Duquesne Club, Hampton Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and the state correctional institution - Pittsburgh. Phillip Chancellor died in the Richland, Pennsylvania area, where the police chief was not told and believed the accident really happened.

On June 27, 2001, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; became the first daytime soap opera to be broadcast in high-definition. In September 2011, its sister soap &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; became the last soap to make the transition from Standard-definition television to High-definition television before &quot;One Life to Live&quot; ended its ABC run on January 13, 2012, and began its TOLN run online on April 29, 2013. On April 24, 2006, Soapnet began airing same-day episodes of the series. The final airing on SoapNet was on June 28, 2013. The soap has moved from SoapNet to TV Guide Network. The same day episodes begin airing on TVGN (now Pop) weeknights on July 1, 2013.

==Development==


Co-creators William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell centered &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; around two core families, the wealthy Brooks&#x27; and the poor Fosters. Bell borrowed this technique of soap opera building from his mentor, Irna Phillips.

While casting for the series, Bell and executive producer John Conboy auditioned 540 actors for the 13 main characters. They assembled the youngest group of actors ever cast on a soap opera at the time, hiring mostly unknown actors whom they considered &quot;glamorous model types&quot;. Chemistry between actors also factored into the criteria for casting. The stories focused on the younger characters, with an emphasis in fantasy. The fantasy element was reflected in the love story between Jill Foster and the millionaire Phillip Chancellor II; the Leslie Brooks, Brad Elliot, and Lorie Brooks love triangle; and Snapper Foster&#x27;s romance with Chris Brooks.

When the series lengthened from a half-hour to an hour in 1980, multiple cast members who portrayed characters from the original core families departed because their contracts only bound them to performing in a half-hour show. A number of the characters were recast until one of the few remaining original actors, Jaime Lyn Bauer, who portrayed Lorie Brooks, decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families. &quot;As I studied the remaining cast, I realized I had two characters- Paul Williams, played by Doug Davidson, and Jack Abbott, played by Terry Lester- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show,&quot; Bell said. &quot;They didn&#x27;t have families. Hell, they didn&#x27;t even have bedrooms. But these became the two characters I would build our two families around.&quot;

The characters from the Abbott and Williams families were integrated into the series while the Brooks and Foster families, with the exception of Jill, were phased out. The continuity of the feud between Jill and Katherine, which began in the early years of the show, smoothed the transition. The relationship between the two characters remained a central theme throughout the series and became the longest lasting rivalry in daytime history.

Another character introduced in the 1980s was Eric Braeden&#x27;s Victor Newman. Originally, the character was &quot;a despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser&quot; who was intended to be killed off. Braeden&#x27;s tenure on the show was meant to last between eight and twelve weeks. &quot;When I saw Eric Braeden&#x27;s first performance- the voice, the power, the inner strength- I knew immediately that I didn&#x27;t want to lose this man,&quot; Bell said. &quot;He was exactly what the show needed. Not the hateful man we saw on-screen, but the man he could and would become.&quot; Bell rewrote the story to save the character and put Braeden on contract. Victor&#x27;s romance with Nikki Reed became a prominent plot in the series.

With the success of another iconic character, Kimberlin Brown&#x27;s Sheila Carter, Bell successfully crossed her over from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; to his second soap, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, in 1992. The success of the crossover was due to the creativity of Bell, as the nefarious character of Sheila was presumed to have died in a fire on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

In the 1990s, core black characters were introduced with the Barber and Winters families. Victoria Rowell (Drucilla Barber) and Tonya Williams (Olivia Winters) were cast as the nieces of the Abbotts&#x27; maid, Mamie Johnson, in 1990. The brothers Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John) and Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore) were introduced as love interests for Olivia and Drucilla. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; became popular among black viewers, which Williams and St. John attributed to the writing for the black characters. &quot;I play a CEO at a major corporation, that&#x27;s something we don&#x27;t see that often,&quot; St. John said. &quot;And the show doesn&#x27;t use the old African-American stereotypes that we have been seeing on TV, like the hustler, the pimp, the drug dealer. We have come a long way.&quot; Though the characters held prominent positions in the fictional work place of Genoa City, they had little interaction with other characters outside of their jobs.

==Themes==
Sexuality played a major role in the stories. Formerly, soap operas did not delve into the sexual side of their romances. Bell changed that, first during his time as head writer of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and again on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. William Gray Espy&#x27;s Snapper Foster is considered the &quot;first to discover sex on a soap opera.&quot; During the story, the character is engaged to Chris Brooks (Trish Stewart) and having a sexual relationship with Sally McGuire (Lee Crawford). Other plots reflected sexual themes as well. For the first time in the genre, the dialogue and the story situations included explicit sexual themes such as premarital intercourse, impotence, incest, and rape. The first two rape storylines that would be told on the serial were controversial at the time as they reflected a more introspective and analytic storytelling style, the first time rape storylines would be addressed in this manner in the genre. The first, in 1973–74, revolved around the rape of Chris Brooks and the aftermath, in which she entertained (and, eventually, rejected) the idea that she was perhaps at fault for her attack. The second, in 1976, involved Chris&#x27;s sister Peggy (Pamela Peters Solow) and was meant to serve as a cut-and-dried story in which no viewer could justify this attack, committed out of the blue by an authority figure.

The series also explored social issues. Jennifer Brooks underwent the first mastectomy on a soap opera. Other social issue storylines included bulimia, alcoholism, and cancer. Lesbianism was also touched on with Katherine Chancellor, who flirts with Jill while drunk in 1974 and has a brief relationship with Joann Curtis (Kay Heberle) in 1977.

==International broadcast==
===Canada===
In Canada, the Global Television Network airs new episodes a day ahead of the US broadcast. Most Global stations use &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as a late-afternoon lead-in for their local newscasts, but times vary by market. It also airs on NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador which airs the program on a same-day-as-CBS basis.

===Caribbean===
In Belize, Channel 5 Great Belize Television airs the soap, while rival Channel 7 Tropical Vision Limited also airs the soap.

In Jamaica, the show formerly aired on CVMTV.

In Trinidad and Tobago, the show airs weekdays on CBS and has been airing in Trinidad and Tobago since the 1980s. In 1988, 70 percent of Trinidadians and Tobagonians who had access to a television watched daily episodes of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, a series that emphasized family problems, sexual intrigue, and gossip.

=== Oceania ===

In Australia, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; airs after &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; on Arena. It previously aired on the Nine Network from April 1, 1974, to February 23, 2007, before joining the W lineup from April 2, 2007, to August 17, 2012. On July 20, 2012, it was announced that the show would move to Arena on August 20 that year after W rebranded as SoHo. Episodes are approximately one week behind those airing in the US at present.

In New Zealand, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; aired alongside &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; on TVNZ 1 from August 25, 1975, to April 1988 where it moved to TVNZ 2, but it returned to TVNZ 1 from 2005 to November 6, 2009. The soap was approximately four seasons behind the CBS season due to being preempted by holiday and sporting programming.

In the Philippines, aired from 1987 to 1989 on ABS-CBN.

=== Europe ===
In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Young and The Restless&quot; has aired on many TV channels starting in 1990, when episodes from 1987 debuted on Galaxy in a regular weekday timeslot, 14:30-15:30 (and repeated in the early hours of the following morning). When BSB merged with Sky in November 1990 to form BskyB, the soap moved to Sky&#x27;s flagship channel Sky One and aired at 11:00-12:00 weekdays until the end of 1992. When BskyB&#x27;s original three-year contract to air the soap expired, Sky chose not to renew it. In 1993, &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; was picked up by satellite channel, UK Living (then known as simply Living, now Sky Witness) in a primetime timeslot 20:00-21:00, picking up where Sky left off. This lasted until late 1995. In 2007, Zone Romantica, now CBS Drama, began broadcasting the show weekdays [four years behind US]. In 2009, when CBS went into partnership with and took over the Chellozone Channels the show was relegated to just one showing a day [in favor of repeating shows such as Dynasty and Dallas in the daytime]. It was attracting around 18–20,000 viewers at midnight in the last week of its broadcast in the UK in August 2010.

In Italy &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; aired as &quot; from February 1983 to February 1984 on Italia 1, from October 1984 to June 1995 on Rete 4, in the summer of 1995 on Canale 5 and from April 1998 to October 2009 again on Rete 4. They were US episodes shown from autumn 1979 to March 1986, from November 1989 to December 1993 and from November 1998 to January 2007.

In France, the show airs as &quot; on free-to-air channel TF1.

In Turkey, the show aired on the public broadcast network TRT under the name of &quot;&quot; (meaning The Wind of Lies), utilising the abbreviation of the name of the original show.

==Music==
&quot;Nadia&#x27;s Theme&quot; has been the theme music of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; since the show&#x27;s debut in 1973. The melody, originally titled &quot;Cotton&#x27;s Dream&quot;, was composed by Barry De Vorzon and Perry Botkin Jr. for the 1971 theatrical film &quot;Bless the Beasts and Children&quot;. The melody was later renamed &quot;Nadia&#x27;s Theme&quot; after the American Broadcasting Company television network&#x27;s sports summary program &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; lent the music for a montage of Romanian gymnast Nadia Comăneci&#x27;s routines during the 1976 Summer Olympics; despite the title, Nadia never performed her floor exercises using this piece of music. Instead, she used a piano arrangement of a medley of the songs &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; and &quot;Jump in the Line&quot;.

Botkin wrote a rearranged version of the piece specifically for &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;&#x27; debut. The song remained unchanged, save for a slight remix in 1988 and a three-year stint in the early 2000s, when an alternate, jazzier arrangement of that tune was used, using portions of the longer closing version of the original theme.

An LP album was published in 1976 by A&amp;M Records. The track list contains two titles of the French composer Michel Colombier, &quot;Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Emmanuel&quot;, a success track which he wrote in memory of the death of his son.

In late September and early October 2012, upon the show&#x27;s 10,000th episode, the current form of opening credits were updated. In the years prior, fans criticized them for their lack of updates and cast additions (some contract players, such as Adrienne Frantz, and Kimberlin Brown came and went without being added).

In mid-February 2017, the opening title sequence was updated in anticipation of the soaps&#x27;s 44th anniversary. In March 2023, the opening title sequence was updated in celebration of the soap&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

==Ratings==
&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; entered CBS&#x27; daytime lineup at 12 noon/11 a.m. Central in March 1973, a timeslot where two popular game shows, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (original version, hosted by Art Fleming) and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Password&quot; (revival of the 1960s hit with Allen Ludden as host), vied for the top spot in the ratings. Quite a number of CBS affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone had for years been running local newscasts at noon, despite CBS giving them a 30-minute break one hour later, at 1 p.m., for that purpose.

With that scenario, at first, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; was at the bottom of the ratings, inheriting &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;&#x27; low numbers and affiliate clearances. However, the youthful and sexually-driven storylines, which appealed perfectly to CBS&#x27; desired key demographic of younger women, helped it to rise rapidly, surging to ninth by 1974–75 and third by 1975–76. This eventually led to both &quot;Jeopardy!&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Password&#x27;s&quot; cancellations during 1975; a succession of shows (of varying formats) on both networks failed to make any significant impact for the next five years, other than perhaps ABC&#x27;s &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid,&quot; which aired at noon/11 from 1978 to 1980. Apart from a dip to sixth in 1980-81 (its first full season at a full hour, when the first half went against ABC&#x27;s then-top-rated &quot;Family Feud&quot; in the Central Time Zone or the second half against the first part of &quot;All My Children&quot; in the Eastern), it has been one of the five highest-rated soaps since the 1975–76 season. After &quot;Feud&#x27;s&quot; decline beginning in 1984 (it would be canceled the next year) and the eventual plateauing of &quot;AMC&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives,&quot; the latter of which did undergo a brief resurgence in the mid-1980s, &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; widened the ratings lead to the point where ABC and NBC never caught up again, both eventually ceding the Noon/11 time slot back to their local stations by the 1990s. By 1988–89 it had dethroned long-time leader &quot;General Hospital&quot; as the top-rated soap, a position it held until 2020. In 2010, it marked its 1,000th consecutive week n the #1 spot for daytime dramas. During the week of December 2, 2013, the series celebrated its 25th consecutive year as the number one daytime drama. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; airs every weeknight on Pop, where it averaged 362,000 viewers from July to September 2013.

On the week ending April 6, 2012, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; was watched by a new low of an average of 3,960,000 viewers for the week, beating its previous low of 4.209 million in October 2011, as well as being the only week to date below 4 million viewers. Currently, the show is still the most-watched daytime drama; and for the season 2011–12, has a household rating of 3.5, and 1.5 for the Women 18–49 demographic. As of 2008, the Tuesday episodes of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; on average is the most-watched daytime drama showing.

<text>USS &quot;Virginia&quot; (CGN-38) was a nuclear-powered guided missile cruiser, the lead ship of her class, and the eighth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Commonwealth of Virginia. She was commissioned in 1976 and decommissioned in 1994.

==Construction==
The ship was laid down on 19 August 1972 by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company as a Destroyer Leader, Guided Missile, Nuclear, DLGN-38. Named &quot;Virginia&quot; for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the vessel was launched on 14 December 1974; sponsored by Virginia S. Warner, daughter of John Warner, a former Secretary of the Navy. &quot;Virginia&quot; was reclassified as a nuclear-powered, guided missile cruiser and redesignated CGN-38 on 30 June 1975; and commissioned on 11 September 1976, Captain George W. Davis, Jr., in command.

==History==
During the first six months of her commissioned service, &quot;Virginia&quot; ranged the eastern seaboard of the United States and cruised in the West Indies several times conducting myriad of post-commissioning tests and shakedown training. On 25 April 1977, she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a five-month, post shakedown availability. She completed her final sea trials on 28 September and began duty as an operational unit of the Atlantic Fleet. In November, she cruised along the New England and Canadian coasts, participating in anti-submarine warfare exercises. In December, she returned to the West Indies for missile firings on the Atlantic Fleet weapons range. She completed that mission on 13 December and reentered Norfolk three days later to begin holiday leave and upkeep in her home port. The beginning of 1978 found her still in Norfolk; but, by mid-month, she returned to sea in the Virginia Capes operating area for a series of local operations. On 28 January, however, she departed Norfolk to return to the area along the Florida coast and in the West Indies for a series of special tests conducted under the auspices of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The guided missile cruiser returned to Norfolk on 23 March and resumed local operations.

That employment lasted until 23 August when &quot;Virginia&quot; embarked upon a cruise to northern Europe to participate in Exercise Northern Wedding, a NATO exercise, the purpose of which was to test the ability to reinforce NATO forces in western Europe. During that deployment, she visited Oslo in Norway, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and Portsmouth in England. The warship departed the latter port on 3 October and reentered Norfolk on 12 October. On 16 November, she put to sea for training exercises in the Gulf of Mexico. During that voyage, she made a port visit at Mobile, Alabama, and conducted naval gunfire support training at Vieques Island near Puerto Rico. She made another port visit to the island of St. Thomas on 6 and 7 December before heading home. &quot;Virginia&quot; reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began preparations for her first deployment to the Mediterranean which was scheduled to commence in early 1979.

As part of an Indian Ocean deployment in 1980, she crossed the Indian Ocean to the Philippines, for emergency Sonar dome repairs. During her third Mediterranean deployment in 1983, she patrolled off Beirut and fired nearly 300 five-inch rounds into Lebanon, many in defense of the strategic mountain town of Suk El Gharb. &quot;Virginia&quot; provided emergency assistance after the Beirut Marine barracks bombing. She was honored as Sixth Fleet Top Hand for that extended deployment. In 1984, she entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for her single major overhaul and was converted to the Navy&#x27;s first strike cruiser with the addition of the Phalanx CIWS, Tomahawk missile and the SM-2 extension of her surface to air capability. During this overhaul, the aft helicopter hangar and elevator were removed and the space refitted with two Armored Box Tomahawk cruise missile launchers (4 missiles each) on deck and an Engineering Department training space below.

In December 1990, &quot;Virginia&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Most of the six-month deployment was spent in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Israel, Lebanon, and Syria. There she commanded a strike group of four vessels including a destroyer () and two SSNs ( and ). On 22 January 1991, she fired two Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean to Iraq, which was at the time the longest combat firing of a Tomahawk. She also directed the launching of four other Tomahawks from USS Spruance and USS Pittsburgh.

==Decommissioning==
She was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 November 1994, &quot;Virginia&quot; entered the Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Surface Ship and Submarine Recycling Program on 31 March 1999.

Her missile launchers are now on display at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia.

<text>The Bold and the Beautiful (often referred to as B&amp;B) is an American television soap opera created by William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell for CBS. It premiered on March 23, 1987, as a sister show to the Bells&#x27; other soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;; several characters from each of the two shows have crossed over to the other since the early 1990s. Set in Los Angeles, California, the show centers upon the Forrester family and their haute couture business.

The program features an ensemble cast, headed by its longest-serving actors John McCook as Eric Forrester and Katherine Kelly Lang as Brooke Logan. Since its premiere, the show has become the most-watched soap in the world, with an audience of an estimated 26.2 million viewers. As of 2010, it continued to hold on to the second-place position in weekly Nielsen Ratings for daytime dramas. &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; has also won 77 Daytime Emmy Awards, including three for Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, in 2009, 2010, as well as 2011.

On September 7, 2011, the series switched to high-definition television, making it the second-to-last American soap to make the switch, at the time. &quot;B&amp;B&quot; was the last American soap opera to make the transition due to the cancellation of ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; before it returned along with &quot;All My Children&quot; on April 29, 2013. It is the youngest airing daytime soap opera in the United States, celebrating its thirtieth anniversary on March 23, 2017. The serial aired its 9,000th episode on April 18, 2023. Currently, the series has been renewed by CBS to run through the 2024–2025 television season.
==Premise==

&quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; debuted on March 23, 1987. Set in Los Angeles, it centers around the Forrester family and their fashion house business, Forrester Creations. Like many soap operas, &quot;B&amp;B&quot; looks into the lives of wealthy families and how love affairs, scandals, and betrayals affect each of the family members and their relationships with each other.

Following the original premise of sister show &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (&quot;Y&amp;R&quot;) with the wealthy Brooks and the working-class Foster families, &quot;B&amp;B&quot; also introduced the middle-class Logan family as a source of conflict with the Forresters. Like the Fosters of &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;, the Logans were also initially headed by a single mother. The rivalry between Forrester matriarch Stephanie Forrester and the Logan&#x27;s eldest daughter Brooke Logan plays a key role in the drama of &quot;B&amp;B&quot;, like the Katherine Chancellor–Jill Abbott rivalry in &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;. Another enduring &quot;B&amp;B&quot; storyline is the star-crossed love of Brooke and the Forresters&#x27; eldest son Ridge.

The back story was that Stephanie Douglas, the strong-willed daughter of wealthy Chicago businessman John Douglas, met her husband-to-be Eric Forrester, who aspired to become a fashion designer, while they both studied at Northwestern University in 1959. The young lovers rushed to get married after Stephanie became pregnant, forcing Eric to break up with his college sweetheart Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Henderson in the process.

Eric and Stephanie then moved to Los Angeles where they established Forrester Creations, designing and producing upscale men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fashion, based on a combination of a loan from Stephanie&#x27;s father, Eric&#x27;s designing talent and Stephanie&#x27;s business acumen and connections. While winning international recognition, fame, and wealth with their work, the couple managed to raise four children: elder and favorite son Ridge Forrester, brother Thorne Forrester and younger sisters Kristen Forrester and Felicia. Meanwhile, Beth married their classmate Stephen Logan on the rebound, raising their own family in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. The Logans had four children of their own: eldest son Stephen &quot;Storm&quot; Jr., and daughters Brooke, Donna and Katie. Unable to achieve success like Eric, Stephen walked out on the family, leaving Beth as a single working-class mother.

===Start and development of the series===

The pilot episode of the show focuses on the preparations of the wedding of the Forrester&#x27;s eldest son, Ridge, to Caroline Spencer Forrester, the daughter of the media mogul Bill Spencer. At this time Ridge has already become a fashion designer and vice president of Forrester Creations. Many media outlets throughout the world, from the big television networks to the most honorable newspapers, to the last gossip newspapers publicize their wedding, declaring it &quot;the wedding of the year in the fashion world.&quot; Thousands of women see the pictures of Ridge and speculate on the identity of the woman who has won the heart of the man who has, until recently, been a playboy, and who has refused to settle for one woman.

One of the curious is Brooke, whose life soon becomes a key element in the series. Her love affair with Ridge sets up much of the storyline, beginning in the first year after the aforementioned &quot;wedding of the year in the fashion world&quot; was called off when Ridge was caught cheating on Caroline with an old flame. Every so often, Ridge and Brooke reunite only to break up due to various circumstances, and Ridge invariably finds comfort (in most cases, this would lead to marriage) with another love of his life, Taylor Hayes. Following one of her breakups with Ridge, Brooke marries his father, Eric, who divorces Stephanie to do so. Brooke gives birth to two children with Eric. The couple eventually divorce and Eric reconciles with Stephanie. Likewise, Brooke and Ridge resume their pattern of an on-again-off-again relationship, between Brooke&#x27;s relationships with other men and Forrester family members, and Ridge&#x27;s multiple reunions with Taylor. Eric eventually marries Brooke&#x27;s sister, Donna Logan, and legally adopts her son Marcus. They later divorce due to their family&#x27;s bitter history.

The rivalry between Stephanie and Brooke also becomes a key storyline in the series. The strong willed Stephanie originally has a cordial relationship with the Logans after hiring their catering company. But she soon disapproves of Brooke becoming part of the Forresters&#x27; lives, believing she is an &quot;opportunist from the valley&quot; who swooped in after the &quot;wedding of the year in the fashion world&quot; was called off. Stephanie also does not initially recognize that Beth is the same woman who was Eric&#x27;s former college girlfriend. Having marital problems since the start of series, Eric soon seeks the comfort of Beth. Once Stephanie learns of the affair, she secretly hires a private investigator to track down Steven Logan and then sends an anonymous letter to the Logan household as to his whereabouts. After Donna finally convinces their father to return home, Stephanie arranges with Bill Spencer to give Stephen a job in Paris. Only Brooke figures out that Stephanie was the one working behind the scenes. When confronted, Stephanie justifies her actions to Brooke saying that she is trying to save both of their families, and threatens Brooke that unless otherwise she will ruin her relationship with Ridge. After her parents reunite and move to Paris, and realizing to what extremes Stephanie would go to get what she wants, Brooke swears revenge.

Felicia and Kristen Forrester eventually choose to follow their own paths, leaving the family company to be run by Ridge, Thorne, Rick, Marcus, and their families. A key element of the show in the late 1990s was Brooke and Eric&#x27;s son Rick&#x27;s relationship with singer turned fashion designer Amber Moore.

===Complementing families===

The Spencer family and their media conglomerate Spencer Publications were first introduced in the pilot episode. Patriarch Bill Spencer was a widower and originally claimed that Caroline was his only daughter. A love triangle develops between Caroline, Ridge and Thorne, leading to a point in 1988 where a drunk Thorne shoots his older brother in the back (which Stephanie covers up to protect both of her sons by lying to authorities that she had fired the gun, thinking it was a burglar). After Caroline dies due to leukemia in 1990, her twin sister Karen Spencer, who was abducted from the Spencers when she was a baby, resurfaces. In 2009, Bill dies from a terminal illness, dividing Spencer Publications between Karen and his previously unknown illegitimate son, Bill Spencer Jr. The Spencers have been expanded in recent years to include Karen&#x27;s daughter Caroline Spencer and Bill Jr.&#x27;s sons Wyatt Spencer, Liam Spencer, and Will Spencer.

For many years, Spectra Fashions was Forrester&#x27;s main rival, headed by Sally Spectra. Sally, a larger-than-life character with outrageous clothes and a sizable red hair, is a key element in both comedic and dramatic storylines, with the help of long-time confidante Saul Feinberg, ditzy receptionist Darla Forrester, and fashion designer Clarke Garrison, who in 1991 fathered C. Garrison Fathman, Sally&#x27;s son. Originally, Sally and Stephanie Forrester are bitter enemies; Spectra is only referred to in 1987 when Stephanie hires Clarke away from her rival. Sally and Spectra Fashions finally appear on-screen in 1989 when Clarke goes back to his former boss. In later years, Sally and Stephanie develop a friendship; Sally even ends up working at Forrester Creations in 2006 after she finally makes the decision to shut down her own company.

Sally&#x27;s daughter, Macy Alexander, a singer, undergoes many traumas, most notably alcoholism. She and Thorne Forrester are involved in an on-again-off-again marriage. After she eventually loses Thorne to Brooke, Macy goes abroad and into hiding with her father, Adam in 2000. After being discovered in Italy in 2002, Macy returns to Los Angeles where she reunites with Thorne Forrester before developing an interest in fellow recovering alcoholic, Deacon Sharpe, whom she marries in 2003. Weeks later, Macy is gravely injured at a nightclub where she is headlining as a singer. She enters a coma and it is implied that her family pulls the plug off-camera.

The Spectra family and friends are gradually supplanted after the 2001 introduction of Massimo Marone and his entourage. Marone, a billionaire shipping magnate, was a childhood friend of Stephanie and dated her in college. They slept together once just before Stephanie began dating Eric Forrester, and after forty-something years, a medical crisis reveals that Massimo is actually Ridge&#x27;s biological father. In 2003, Jackie Payne, a former lover of Massimo, arrives on the scene and announces that her son, Dominick &quot;Nick&quot; Payne, a captain at Marone Industries, was also fathered by Massimo. Unlike Ridge, Nick was not a businessman and took the surname Marone.

==Production==

===Development===
In 1986, CBS was on the hunt to replace &quot;Capitol&quot;, and contacted several writers and producers for proposals. Paul Rauch created &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot; as a replacement. During her absence from &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, Michael Brockman, former President of CBS Daytime, asked Claire Labine to develop a new serial in 1986. Her proposal was entitled Celebration but never made it to the air. Had it been greenlit, Jane Greenstein would have been Assistant to the Head Writer like she was on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. William J. Bell created &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;Rags&quot;. On June 20, 2017, CBS announced its decision to renew the serial through the 2017–18 television season. On April 20, 2020, CBS announced plans to begin airing a week of vintage episodes, following the soap&#x27;s shutdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. On May 20, 2020, it was announced that CBS had renewed the soap through 2022. On June 15, 2020, TVLine reported the series would be the first to resume production on June 17 as the first scripted series on American soil to get back up and running following Hollywood&#x27;s three-month, coronavirus-imposed shutdown with a representative telling the website: &quot;The health and safety of our cast and crew are of foremost importance to us, We will be following all protocols set forth by the State, City, Television City, and the various guilds.&quot;

On March 2, 2022, it was announced that CBS had renewed the soap through 2024.

===Taping===
&quot;B&amp;B&quot; has been shot at Stage 31 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles for its entire run so far. The show typically uses the traditional soap opera look, featuring constructed sets such as the Forrester Mansion, the &quot;Shady Marlin&quot; and the Forrester Creations offices. Like other soap operas, &quot;B&amp;B&quot; is usually taped three to four weeks in advance. In recent times, the show has increased shooting on location, in the way fellow CBS soap &quot;Guiding Light&quot; did in its final two network years. Many of the characters have taken trips to the fictional &quot;Bikini Beach&quot; which is actually a nearby California beach, and there have been scenes around the Forrester Creations building which appear to be shot somewhere on the lot or inside of CBS Television City.

===Theme song and title sequence===

&quot;High Upon This Love,&quot; the theme song of &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, was written by David Kurtz and Jack Allocco and features a prominent saxophone sample played by Eric Marienthal. From November 1998 to July 1999 in the United States, a vocal version of the theme song performed by Dionne Warwick was played during the end credits.

Some international versions, most notably in Italy and France, have different opening and ending credits. In Italy, the opening and closing theme was composed by Roberto Colombo. The opening theme (Tutti Beautiful) was used since his Italian premiere until 2011, while the closing theme (Beautiful Caroline) was used until 2017.

For the 30th anniversary season in 2017, the show rolled out a title sequence based on the original used in one form or another from 1987 to 2004. At the same time, it also introduced an instrumentation of &quot;High Upon This Love&quot; based on the original.

==Cast and crew==
===Cast===
John McCook (Eric Forrester) and Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke Logan) are the only two cast members who have remained on the show since it first aired on March 23, 1987. During the show&#x27;s first 25 years, McCook and Lang were part of the &quot;core four&quot; original cast members, the other two being Susan Flannery (Stephanie Forrester) and Ronn Moss (Ridge Forrester). When Moss announced that he was leaving the show in August 2012, the role of Ridge was eventually recast more than a year later. When Flannery also announced her departure later that year, it was decided to have Stephanie&#x27;s character die after losing her battle with cancer. Two other original characters currently appear on the show, Donna Logan and Katie Logan, but both have been recast since the show&#x27;s premiere.

==Ratings==

Upon its debut as the replacement of former soap opera &quot;Capitol&quot; in the CBS Daytime lineup, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; ended eighth in the final year ratings. Initially CBS&#x27;s lowest-rated soap, its numbers were still respectable and began to climb. By 1992, after a successful crossover involving villain Sheila Carter from &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, it had climbed to third. By the mid-to-late 1990s, following yet another crossover, it moved up to second and has consistently remained there since. Throughout the 2000s, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and all the other remaining network daytime dramas witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by cable networks and alternative genres such as reality, court shows, and talk shows on minor network affiliates, along with consistent breaking news pre-emptions that often unexpectedly broke viewing momentum.

<text>Human potential is the capacity for humans to improve themselves through studying, training, and practice, to reach the limit of their ability to develop aptitudes and skills. &quot;Inherent within the notion of human potential is the belief that in reaching their full potential an individual will be able to lead a happy and more fulfilled life&quot;.

==Meaning and scope==
The term potential generally refers to a currently unrealized ability. The term is used in a wide variety of fields, from physics to the social sciences to indicate things that are in a state where they are able to change in ways ranging from the simple release of energy by objects to the realization of abilities in people. The philosopher Aristotle incorporated this concept into his theory of potentiality and actuality, a pair of closely connected principles which he used to analyze motion, causality, ethics, and physiology in his &quot;Physics&quot;, &quot;Metaphysics&quot;, &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; and &quot;De Anima&quot;, which is about the human psyche. That which is potential can theoretically be made actual by taking the right action; for example, a boulder on the edge of a cliff has potential to fall that could be actualized by pushing it over the edge, and a person whose natural aptitudes give them the potential to be a great pianist can actualize that potential by diligently practicing playing the piano.

The concept of developing potential is sometimes described in terms of becoming the best version of oneself. Persons who are believed to have a degree of potential that they do not pursue are often described as having failed to &quot;live up to their potential&quot;.

Early conceptions of human potential suggested that the full potential of any person was innate in that person from before their birth, possibly from the moment of their conception. More recent definitions have encompassed both internal and societal influences.

==Human-potential model==
According to the American Psychological Association, the human-potential model is an approach in the field of Education that &quot;emphasizes the importance of helping learners to achieve the maximum development of their potential in all aspects of their functioning&quot;. It is related to and draws from the associated field of humanistic psychology.

==Human Potential Movement==
The Human Potential Movement was a particular counterculture movement started in the 1960s with a focus of maximizing human potential. It was influenced by the work of those such as Abraham Maslow, and took the form of a type of psychological philosophy.

==See also==

* Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs, psychological theory regarding behavioral motivation and self-actualization
* Personal development, activities over the course of a person&#x27;s life that contribute to things such as the improvement of awareness and identity
* Social development theory, which attempts to explain qualitative changes in the structure and framework of society, that help the society to better realize aims and objectives

<text>John Craig (1663 – 11 October 1731) was a Scottish mathematician and theologian.
==Biography==
Born in Dumfries and educated at the University of Edinburgh, Craig moved to England and became a vicar in the Church of England.

A friend of Isaac Newton, he wrote several minor works about the new calculus.

He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1711.

==Mathematical Principles of Christian Theology==
He is known for his book &quot;Theologiae Christianae Principia Mathematica&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Principles of Christian Theology&quot;), published in 1698.

In the aforementioned book, Craig presents a formula that describes how the probability of a historical event depends on the number of primary witnesses, on the chain of transmission through secondary witnesses, on the elapsed time and on the spatial distance. Using this formula, Craig derived that the probability of the story of Jesus would reach 0 in the year 3150. This year he interpreted as the Second Coming of Christ because of verse 18:8 in the Gospel of Luke.

His work was poorly received and controversial at the time. Several later mathematicians complained about his imprecise use of probability and the unsupported derivation of his formula. Stephen Stigler, in his 1999 book (see references, below) gave a more favorable interpretation, pointing out that some of Craig&#x27;s reasoning can be justified if his &quot;probability&quot; is interpreted as the log-likelihood ratio.

==Logarithms==
Craig was involved in developing the concept of Hyperbolic logarithm and in 1710 published “Logarithmotechnica generalis” in the Proceedings of the Royal Society. By way of illustration he gives the Mercator series for the logarithm (denoted l.) without mention of radius of convergence: 
“Exemplar 1. Assumatur &quot;a&quot; = &quot;y&quot;, unde per Canonum generalum formula_1
cujus differentials est formula_2 &amp; hujus integralis per Seriem infinitum expressa dat 
:formula_3&quot;

<doc id="191599" wikidata="Q1145764" url="?curid=191599" title="Guiding Light">
<text>Guiding Light (known as The Guiding Light before 1975) is an American radio and television soap opera. &quot;Guiding Light&quot; aired on CBS for 57 years between June 30, 1952, and September 18, 2009, overlapping a 19-year broadcast on radio between January 25, 1937, and June 29, 1956. With 72 years of radio and television runs, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; is the longest-running American soap opera, ahead of &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

When the show debuted on radio in 1937, it centered on Reverend John Ruthledge and people whose lives revolved around him. The &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in the show&#x27;s title originally referred to the lamp in Ruthledge&#x27;s study that people used as a sign for them to find his help when needed. When the show transitioned to television in the 1950s, the Bauers, a German immigrant family first introduced in 1948, became the focus of the program. Other core families were introduced over the show&#x27;s run, including the Norrises in the 1960s; the Marlers and the Spauldings in the 1970s; and the Coopers, the Lewises, and the Reardons in the 1980s.

&quot;Guiding Light&quot; was created by Irna Phillips and Emmons Carlson and began as an NBC Radio serial on January 25, 1937. On June 2, 1947, the series was transferred to CBS Radio, before starting on June 30, 1952, on CBS Television. It continued to be broadcast on radio until June 29, 1956. The series was expanded from 15 minutes to a half-hour during 1968 (and also switched from broadcasting live to pre-taping around this same time), and then to a full hour on November 7, 1977. The series broadcast its 15,000th CBS television episode on September 6, 2006.

On April 1, 2009, CBS announced that it was canceling &quot;Guiding Light&quot; after 72 years on the air (15 on radio and 57 on television) due to low ratings. The show taped its final scenes on August 11, 2009, and its final episode on the network aired on September 18, 2009. Reruns of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; took over the &quot;Guiding Light&quot; time slot between September 21 and October 2, 2009, for two weeks. On October 5, 2009, CBS replaced &quot;Guiding Light&quot; with an hour-long revival of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, hosted by Wayne Brady.

==Origins, plot development, and cast==

&quot;Guiding Light&quot; has had a number of plot sequences during the series&#x27; long history, on both radio and television. These plot sequences include complex storylines, and different writers and casting.

===1930s and 1940s===
The series was created by Emmons Carlson and Irna Phillips, who based it on personal experiences. After giving birth to a still-born baby at age 19, Phillips found spiritual comfort listening to the radio sermons of Preston Bradley, a famous Chicago preacher and founder of the People&#x27;s Church, a church which promoted the brotherhood of man. These sermons inspired the creation of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, which began as a radio series, with a minister as the central character. The original radio series was first broadcast as 15-minute episodes on NBC Radio, starting on January 25, 1937. The series was transferred to CBS Radio in 1947.

===1950s===
&quot;The Guiding Light&quot; was broadcast first by CBS Television on June 30, 1952, replacing the canceled soap opera &quot;The First Hundred Years&quot;. These episodes were also 15 minutes long. During the period from 1952 to 1956, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; existed as both a radio and television serial, with actors recording their performances twice for each day that the shows were broadcast. The radio broadcast of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; ceased production during 1956, ending this overlap.

With the transition to television, the main characters became the Bauers, a lower-middle class German immigrant family who were first introduced in the radio serial in 1948. Many storylines revolved around Bill Bauer (son of patriarch Friedrich &quot;Papa&quot; Bauer) and his new wife Bertha (nicknamed &quot;Bert&quot;). Papa Bauer, who came to the United States during World War I with just a few dollars in his pocket, was a character who succeeded in offering opportunities to his children by working hard, and he instilled that work ethic into his children. Bert had dreams of climbing the social ladder and keeping up appearances, and it was up to Bill (and sometimes Papa Bauer) to bring her down to earth.

&quot;The Guiding Light&quot; ranked as the number one-rated soap opera during both 1956 and 1957, before being replaced during 1958 by &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. After Irna Phillips was transferred to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; during 1958, her protégé Agnes Nixon became head writer of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;.

The first television producer of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; was Lucy Ferri Rittenberg, who produced the show for over 20 years.

===1960s===
Agnes Nixon relinquished her role as chief writer during 1965 to work on &quot;Another World&quot;. On March 13, 1967, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; was first broadcast in color. On September 9, 1968, the program was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes.

The 1960s featured the introduction of Black characters, played by Billy Dee Williams, James Earl Jones, Ruby Dee, and Cicely Tyson. The emphasis of the series shifted to Bill and Bert&#x27;s children, Mike and Ed; the character of Bill Bauer was written out in July 1969, presumed dead after a plane crash. The show also became a bit more topical during the 1960s, with such storylines as Bert Bauer&#x27;s diagnosis of uterine cancer in 1962.

A number of new characters were introduced during the mid- to late 1960s, including Dr. Sara McIntyre, who remained a major character through the early 1980s.

===1970s===
Much of the story during the first half of the 1970s was dominated by Stanley Norris&#x27; November 1971 murder and the subsequent trial, as well as the exploits of villainesses Charlotte Waring and Kit Vested. Charlotte (at the time played by Melinda Fee) was murdered by Kit (Nancy Addison) on August 26, 1973. The following year, Kit was shot by Joe Werner (Anthony Call) in self-defense on April 24, 1974, after she had attempted to poison Sara McIntyre.

Roger Thorpe was introduced on April 1, 1971 and became a pivotal character. The role of Roger was originally proposed to be a blond, fair-skinned, preppy type, a man who was dating his boss&#x27;s daughter Holly. Ultimately, Michael Zaslow, a dark-haired actor, was hired for the role instead by long-time casting director, Betty Rea. Zaslow portrayed Roger as a complicated and multifaceted villain.

Cast member Theo Goetz, who played Papa Bauer, died in 1972. Producers decided that Papa Bauer would die onscreen. The cast paid tribute to Goetz and Papa Bauer in a special memorial episode which aired on February 27, 1973.

Pressured by newer, more youth-oriented soap operas such as &quot;All My Children&quot;, Procter &amp; Gamble hired head writers Bridget and Jerome Dobson in 1975, who started writing in November. The Dobsons introduced a more nuanced, psychologically layered writing style, and included timely story lines, including a complex love/hate relationship between estranged spouses/step-siblings Roger and Holly. They also introduced several new characters, including Rita Stapleton, whose complex relationships with Roger and Ed propelled much of the story for the remainder of the decade, as well as mogul Alan Spaulding and brash lawyer Ross Marler.

In 1977, the character of Bill Bauer was reintroduced. GL had told a story where Bill died in an airplane crash in July 1969, so his reappearance was a surprise. Bill was subsequently charged for a murder of a man in Vancouver (he was acquitted, with Mike&#x27;s help) and by April 1978 Bill had left town again. The character of Bill returned briefly in November 1978, April 1980, and then again in July and November 1983. Bill&#x27;s return introduced the audience and the Bauers to another character that stayed on the show until September 1984, Hillary Kincaid, R. N. (Bauer), Bill&#x27;s daughter, and thus Ed and Mike&#x27;s half-sister. (Bill had accidentally killed the man that Hillary originally thought was her father, but was actually her step-father.)

Jerome and Bridget Dobson killed off the show&#x27;s young heroine, Leslie Jackson Bauer Norris Bauer, in June 1976, when Lynne Adams left the show. Leslie was killed in a hit and run accident by Spence Jeffries, estranged husband of Mike’s secretary Anne. Her father, Steve Jackson, remained on the show for the remainder of the 1970s, serving as a senior physician at Cedars, and as a friend and companion to Bert Bauer.

In November 1975, the name was changed in the show&#x27;s opening and closing visuals from &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; to &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. On November 7, 1977, the show expanded to a full hour and was broadcast from 2:30 to 3:30 pm daily.

===1980s===
Bridget and Jerome Dobson moved on to the head writing duties of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in late 1979. Former actor Douglas Marland assumed the writing reins of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 1979. He introduced many new characters, including the Reardon family. During May 1980, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; won its first Outstanding Drama Series Daytime Emmy. One of Marland&#x27;s stories featured the character of Carrie Todd Marler, played by Jane Elliot. Carrie was diagnosed with multiple personalities. Marland had barely delved into her psychosis when Elliot&#x27;s contract was abruptly terminated by Executive Producer Allen M. Potter in 1982. As a result, Marland resigned in protest.

During the early 1980s, the show began to emphasize younger characters more, as an attempt to compete with the younger-skewing ABC serials. A number of longtime characters were eliminated during this time, including Ben and Eve McFarren, Diane Ballard, Dr. Sara McIntyre, Adam Thorpe, Barbara Norris Thorpe, Justin Marler and Steve Jackson. Actress Lenore Kasdorf quit the show in 1981, and producers decided not to recast the role of Rita Stapleton Bauer, given how popular Kasdorf had been. The Bauer family matriarch, Bertha &#x27;Bert&#x27; Bauer, died in March 1986, following the real-life death of Charita Bauer in 1985. During &quot;Guiding Light&#x27;s&quot; 50th anniversary year in 1987, a commitment was pledged to showcase the Bauer family in primary roles as much as possible, after audience reaction to the Oklahoma-bred Lewis and Shayne families turned out to be mixed. As a result, the tradition of the Bauer July 4 family barbecue began that year, and continued until 2009, the serial&#x27;s final year on CBS Television.

Pam Long, actress and writer for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Texas&quot; from 1981 to 1982, became head writer during 1983, joined by Gail Kobe as executive producer. During Long&#x27;s first stint as writer, the show shifted focus to the young love quadrangle of Rick Bauer, Phillip Spaulding, Mindy Lewis, and Beth Raines. Bauer, Spaulding, Reardon, and Raines families. Long also introduced several other characters, including Alexandra Spaulding, played by notable daytime actress Beverlee McKinsey, of &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; fame; and Reva Shayne, played by Kim Zimmer. After a break, Pamela K. Long returned for a second head writer stint from 1987 to 1990.

The characters of Roger Thorpe and Holly Norris returned to the series during the late 1980s. Maureen Garrett reprised her role of Holly in 1988, followed by Michael Zaslow as Roger in 1989.

===1990s===

With the new decade, the series&#x27; storytelling transitioned from Long&#x27;s homespun style to a more realistic style with a new group of chief writers. The Bauer, Spaulding, Lewis, and Cooper families had been established as core families, and most major plot developments concerned them. The show generally held on in the middle of the pack as far as ratings went throughout the decade.

The show experienced a series of challenges in 1993, including the exit of three of the show&#x27;s leading actresses – Beverlee McKinsey, Kimberley Simms, and Sherry Stringfield – within the space of a few months. In particular, McKinsey&#x27;s Alexandra had been a catalyst for several stories. The decision to kill off the character of Maureen Bauer proved deeply unpopular with the audience, and is often cited as one of the show&#x27;s biggest mistakes.

Executive producer Jill Farren Phelps cast a number of actors she&#x27;d worked with at other shows, particularly at &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, in new roles at GL. Among them: Justin Deas, in the role of long lost Cooper patriarch Buzz; and Marj Dusay as the new actress to play Alexandra Spaulding.

In 1994, the show brought former &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; actress Marcy Walker to the canvas to play antiheroine Tangie Hill, but the pairing of Tangie with Josh Lewis proved unpopular, and Walker decided not to renew her contract

In 1995, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; brought back fan favorite Nola Chamberlain, played by Lisa Brown. However, Nola returning to the canvas on her own without husband Quinton Chamberlain was unpopular with viewers. Soap opera veteran Mary Stuart joined the cast in 1996 as Meta Bauer (though referred to many times over the years, the character originally played by Ellen Demming had not been seen onscreen since 1974); the character remained on the show until Stuart&#x27;s death during 2002.

As the decade progressed, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; began to feature stories with more outlandish plot twists, seemingly to compete with shows like &quot;Passions&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.
A number of these stories involved the character of Reva Shayne, played by Kim Zimmer. Reva had been presumed dead for the previous five years, after having driven her car off of a bridge and into the water off the Florida Keys.

The outlandish plots for Reva included her time as an amnesiac Amish woman, the former queen of San Cristobel, and a story where Reva experienced time travel. The most notable of these plot twists was when Josh, believing again that Reva had died, had her cloned.

===2000s===
The 2000s began with the division of the show into two locales: Springfield and the fictional island nation of San Cristobel. In Springfield, the Santos mob dynasty created much of the drama. Meanwhile, the royal Winslow family had their own series of intrigues with which to deal. During 2002, however, San Cristobel was eliminated from the series and the mob&#x27;s influence in the story was subsequently diminished and, with the departure of character Danny Santos during 2005, eliminated altogether. Also, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; celebrated its 50th anniversary as a television show on June 30, 2002.

During 2004, former director and actress Ellen Wheeler (Emmy Award winner as an actress for the series &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot;) took over as executive producer of &quot;Guiding Light.&quot; She and writer David Kreizman made numerous changes to the sets, stories, and the cast. Several veteran actors were eliminated, mainly because of budget decreases. Because of the lack of veteran influence, Wheeler reemphasized the youth of Springfield, especially the controversial pairing of cousins Jonathan and Tammy.

During 2006, an episode featured character Harley Cooper gaining heroic abilities. The episode was semi-continued in an 8-page story in select Marvel Comics productions.

The series had its 70th broadcast anniversary during 2007. The anniversary was commemorated with the initiation of website FindYourLight.net and a program of outreach, representing Irna Phillips&#x27; original message. There was also a special episode during January 2007, with current cast members playing Phillips and some of the earlier cast members. The series also introduced special beginning credits commemorating the anniversary. The show had a rotating slate of writers, including veteran GL writers Lucky Gold, Chris Dunn, and Jill Lorie Hurst, who was eventually named head writer.

Despite low ratings, the show won 2007 Daytime Emmy Awards for Best Writing and Best Show (sharing Best Show with&quot; The Young and the Restless&quot;).

====Cancellation and final episode====
On April 1, 2009, CBS announced that it would not renew &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, and the last broadcast date would be September 18, 2009. Procter &amp; Gamble initially announced that they would attempt to find another outlet to distribute the series, but later admitted that they had been unsuccessful in doing so, and that on September 18, 2009, after 57 years on television (preceded by 15 years on radio for a total broadcast history of 72 years), &quot;Guiding Light&quot; would end its broadcast history on CBS.

Storylines were resolved in the final weeks of the series, and numerous characters from the series&#x27; past passed through Springfield one last time. Among the returnees were the characters of Nola, Holly and Mindy; Josh told Reva that he was leaving Springfield for a job for the next year, but proposes that he return one year from that date and, if by that time, she wants to reunite with him, she should meet him at the lighthouse and, if she is not there, he will assume she is not interested.

The final episode is pleasant, featuring many of the characters gathering in the park for a large picnic. Toward the end of the episode, it jumps forward one year, by which time, Phillip and Beth have reunited, as have Rick and Mindy. Olivia and Natalia, happy with their new baby, pick up Rafe as he returns from the army. The episode concludes with Josh arriving at the lighthouse, as promised, and finding Reva there. They declare their undying love. James, Ashlee, and Daisy leave Springfield and relocate to Santa Barbara, California. Josh asks if Reva is packed, to go on an adventure. The two grab the luggage, and with Reva&#x27;s young son, they climb into Josh&#x27;s pick-up truck. Josh says to Reva, &quot;You ready?&quot; She replies &quot;always,&quot; a callback to her promise of &quot;Always, Bud&quot; that Reva uttered to Josh many times on the show. As the truck drives away with the lighthouse in the background, &quot;The End&quot; appears on the screen before a final fadeout. The song heard playing in the background during the final scene is &quot;Together&quot; by Michelle Branch.

The final episode also included the original tag line, with some revision, printed on the screen with the words &quot;There is a destiny that makes us FAMILY&quot; (replacing the word &#x27;brothers&#x27;), as well as quick film clips of each of the show&#x27;s title cards and announcers during the nearly six decades it was on television, leading to the show&#x27;s former long-time beginning announcement: &quot;And now, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;&quot;.

==Production and locales==
&quot;Guiding Light&quot; was broadcast from three locations: Chicago (where creator Irna Phillips resided), from 1937 until 1946; Hollywood, from 1947 until 1949; and New York City starting during 1949. It was relocated from Chicago to Hollywood (despite objections of both Phillips and Arthur Peterson) to take advantage of the talent pool. Production was subsequently relocated to New York City, where the majority of soap operas were produced during the 1950s, 1960s and much of the 1970s; it remained based in New York City until the show&#x27;s conclusion. Its final taping location was the CBS studios in midtown Manhattan. From the 1970s to the 1990s it was filmed at the Chelsea Studios. From soon before February 29, 2008, outdoor scenes were filmed on location in Peapack, New Jersey. The location filming coincided with another significant production change, as the series became the first American weekday soap opera to be recorded digitally. The production team chose to film with Canon XH-G1 HDV camcorders in standard definition mode. Unlike the old production model with pedestal-style cameras and traditional three-sided sets, handheld cameras allowed producers to choose as many locations as they wished.

===Final CBS seasons===
During the daytime drama&#x27;s 57th season on television and 72nd overall season, the series had changed its look to a more realistic experience in an attempt to compete with the growing popularity of reality television. The new look of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; included free-hand camera work and less action shown on traditional studio sets. Producer Ellen Wheeler introduced a &quot;shaky-cam&quot; style, present in a number of movies, featuring extreme-closeups and frequent cuts, including those that &quot;broke the axis&quot; (which proved disorienting to viewers accustomed to shows with the traditional &quot;soap opera look&quot;). Also new was the filming of outdoor scenes in actual outdoor settings. Even many indoor scenes had more of an &quot;on location&quot; feel, repurposing real locations, such as &quot;Guiding Light&quot; production offices, to be motel rooms, nail salons, quick-mart and other businesses or locations. Thereby, the series had numerous sets without the cost of numerous separate locations. CBS and the show&#x27;s producers had hoped that the new look would increase ratings, but the plan was ultimately unsuccessful.

On April 1, 2009, CBS canceled &quot;Guiding Light&quot; after 72 years, with the series finale on the network airing on September 18, 2009, making it the second-to-last Procter &amp; Gamble soap opera to end.

===Production summary===
The action has also been set in three different locales – it was based in the fictional towns of Five Points and Selby Flats before its final locale of Springfield.

==Cast and characters==
==Broadcast history==

Unlike most popular radio serials transitioning to television, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; had no difficulty holding onto its old listening audience and simultaneously earning a new television fanbase. For at the time &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; made its television debut, neither ABC nor NBC had broadcast programs on their respective networks at 2:30 p.m. Eastern/1:30 Central, where CBS first placed &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;. However, six months into the run, the network moved the serial to a timeslot that gave it great popularity with its housewife audience: 12:45 p.m./11:45 a.m. It kept the new timeslot for the next 19 years and eight months, sharing the half-hour with its sister Procter &amp; Gamble-packaged soap opera, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;.

&quot;The Guiding Light&quot; handled the competition breezily, even against otherwise-legendary shows such as &quot;Queen for a Day&quot; on ABC (briefly in 1960) and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;. Usually, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; ranked second in the Nielsen ratings behind another serial, &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. 1968, however, saw changing viewership trends that prompted CBS to expand its last two 15-minute daytime dramas, disrupting long-standing viewing habits. &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; took over the entire 12:30–1/11:30–Noon period, with &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; returning to its first timeslot, 2:30/1:30, albeit in the now-standard half-hour format, on September 9. This twin bill of expansions also caused the dislocation of &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; and the beloved &quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s House Party&quot;, as well as the cancellation of the daytime &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. It also put the serial in direct competition with NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Doctors&quot;, which was beginning to peak in its popularity. Thus, the early 1970s saw the popularity of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; dip somewhat.

After four years of airing at 2:30/1:30, CBS acceded to a demand made by &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; producer Procter &amp; Gamble and moved its sibling series, &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, to the earlier hour from its previous home at 3:30/2:30. Moving back one half hour, &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; stayed steadily on course against NBC&#x27;s &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;. In late 1974, ABC replaced &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot; with &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;, which went on to garner strong ratings, but not greatly at &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; expense. In 1975, the show officially dropped the word &quot;The&quot; from its title, although it was still referred to as &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; on air for several years after.

As the year progressed, CBS was looking to expand one of its daytime soap operas. All of its serials were now thirty minutes in length and had been since &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;Search For Tomorrow&quot; made the move in 1968. NBC had found ratings success with expanding &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; to one hour earlier in 1975. CBS thought it too could find success, so the decision was made to expand &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which was airing before &quot;Guiding Light&quot; at 1:30/12:30. Thus, in December, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; moved back to 2:30/1:30 in place of &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which switched networks and began airing on ABC. ABC had a short-lived hit the next year with an updated version of the game show &quot;Break the Bank&quot;. To complicate the picture further, ABC opted to make its first show expansions, those of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, in July 1976; each of those shows occupied one-half of a 90-minute block until November 4, 1977.

With this in mind, ABC and CBS acted to give a contending chance to both &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; by expanding them to an hour in length. CBS started first by expanding &quot;Guiding Light&quot; to an hour on November 7, 1977. This gained particular importance when ABC finally expanded both &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; to an hour on January 16, 1978, so that &quot;Guiding Light&quot; straddled those two programs, as well as the first half of sister P&amp;G show &quot;Another World&quot; on NBC. Despite that &quot;General Hospital&quot; surprising all observers by skyrocketing from near-cancellation to the top place in the ratings with the various storylines, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; held its own while in direct competition with &quot;General Hospital&quot;, still hit an upswing as the decade ended.

On February 4, 1980, CBS bumped &quot;Guiding Light&quot; down again, to 3 p.m./2c, and its sister P&amp;G soap &quot;As The World Turns&quot; to 2 p.m./1c, in the midst of a major scheduling shuffle intended to give &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (itself now expanding to an hour length) a shot at beating ABC&#x27;s &quot;All My Children&quot;. NBC did the same with its soap operas as well with all three networks now going head-head in every time slot. It remained in this time slot for the rest of its run in some markets, facing &quot;General Hospital&quot; and NBC entries such as &quot;Texas&quot; (a spin-off of &quot;Another World&quot;), &quot;The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; and &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;. None of these shows – not even &quot;General Hospital&quot; – had any significant impact on the ratings of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; at 3:00 p.m. during this period.

Overall, the first half of the 1980s saw a revival in &quot;Guiding Light&quot; popularity, with a top-five placing achieved in most years and even a brief dethroning of then-powerhouse &quot;General Hospital&quot; from the #1 ratings spot for three consecutive weeks. However, as the decade progressed, the ratings slipped a bit, although it was still performing solidly. In 1995, beginning with CBS flagship station WCBS-TV in New York, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; began airing at 10 a.m. Eastern time in several markets. Its once-solid performance began to crumble by the mid-1990s, when its ratings sunk as low as ninth place out of ten. However, during the controversial clone storyline in 1998, the ratings experienced a brief resurgence, moving up to fifth for many weeks that summer. Nielsen reported &quot;Guiding Light&quot; had 5 million viewers in 1999.

Up until its CBS finale in 2009, stations in a number of markets aired &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in the morning either at 9 or 10 a.m. local time: Miami, Chicago, Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Dallas-Fort Worth, Orlando, Atlanta, Columbia, SC, Fort Wayne, IN, South Bend, IN, Portland, OR, Quad Cities, Buffalo, Reno, Portland, ME, Milwaukee, Albany, NY, and Scranton-Wilkes Barre, PA. &quot;Guiding Light&quot; aired at 12 noon local time in Honolulu, Hawaii. In Savannah, GA, it aired at 4:00 pm local time.

Before 2004, stations that aired &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in the morning were always one episode behind those that aired the program at its official timeslot of 3:00 pm (ET). This changed in March 2004, during the first day of the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, in which stations airing the show at 10:00 am were able catch up with stations that televised it at 3:00 pm. Starting in 2006, stations that televised &quot;Guiding Light&quot; at 9:00 am were also offered a same-day feed to catch up with the rest of the network. As a result of this, daily episodes for the remaining years of &quot;GL&quot; were the same on all stations regardless of timeslot.

&quot;Guiding Light&quot; maintained strong ratings in Pittsburgh, despite being moved to 10:00 am in 2006. According to a 2006 article in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; had not been able to pull in the same numbers that &quot;Guiding Light&quot; did in that time slot a year prior, while &quot;Guiding Light&quot; was maintaining its audience share.

One CBS affiliate that did not air the show was KOVR-TV in Sacramento, California, which had become a CBS affiliate in 1995. Before CBS affiliated with KOVR, it had been affiliated in Sacramento with KXTV, which had dropped &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from its schedule in 1992 and did not air it again. As such, the show was preempted in the Sacramento area from 1992 to the show&#x27;s cancellation. WNEM-TV in Flint/Saginaw/Bay City, Michigan, which also became a CBS affiliate that year, initially ran the soap before dropping it in 1996 because of disappointing ratings. In the fall of 2006, WNEM began running &quot;Guiding Light&quot; on its digital channel WNEM-DT2 (affiliated with MyNetwork TV and then-branded as &quot;My 5&quot;) at 10 am, airing there for the remainder of its run.

On September 18, 2009, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; aired its final episode at 3:00 pm ET/2:00 pm CT on CBS. A revival of the game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; (hosted by Wayne Brady) debuted on CBS and took over the &quot;Guiding Light&quot; timeslot on October 5, 2009.

===Broadcast history in Canada===
In Canada, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; was available to viewers directly through CBS-TV network affiliates from border cities or cable TV feeds until the show&#x27;s ending in 2009. In addition, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; was also aired on several Canadian television networks through the 1980s up until its last air date.

Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) – a supplementary service to its ATV system of CTV affiliates exclusively for Atlantic Canada – aired the soap simultaneously with the CBS feed from 1983 to 1984; then, the broadcast was moved to 12 noon until 1985.

The show also aired in French in Quebec. TVA, a Quebec privately owned French-language television network, rebroadcast episodes in French translation, twelve months behind, for a short period in 1984.

In the late 1980s into the early 1990s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) briefly aired the P&amp;G serial nationally at 3:00 p.m. in each specific local Canadian time zone. The CBC Television broadcast of &quot;Guiding Light&quot; was also on its schedule during the latter part of the 1960s during the serial 15-minute format. On both occasions, the daytime drama was only aired for a few seasons.

After a hiatus from Canadian television stations for many years, the series came back on CHCH-TV, exclusively for the Ontario market. In September 2007, Global picked up the show nationwide after CHCH-TV dropped it, claiming the &quot;Passions&quot; former time slot. &quot;Guiding Light&quot; returned to CHCH for the rest of its run when Global decided to air the 2008 TV series &quot;The Doctors&quot;.

<text>As the World Turns (often abbreviated as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010. Irna Phillips created &quot;As the World Turns&quot; as a sister show to her other soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. With 13,763 hours of cumulative narrative, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; has the longest total running time of any television show. In terms of continuous run of production, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; at 54 years holds the fourth-longest run of any daytime network soap opera on American television, surpassed only by &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was produced for its first 43 years in Manhattan and in Brooklyn from 2000 until 2010.

Set in the fictional town of Oakdale, Illinois, the show debuted on April 2, 1956, at 1:30 p.m. EST, airing as a 30-minute serial. Prior to that date, all serials had been 15 minutes in length. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which premiered on the same day at 4:30 p.m. EST, were the first two to be 30 minutes in length from their premieres. At first, viewers were indifferent to the new half-hour serial, but ratings picked up in its second year, eventually reaching the top spot in the daytime Nielsen ratings by fall 1958. In 1959, the show started a streak of weekly ratings wins that was not interrupted for over 12 years. The show switched to color on August 21, 1967, and expanded from a half hour in length to one hour daily starting on December 1, 1975, when &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; moved to ABC. In the year-to-date ratings, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was the most-watched daytime drama from 1958 until 1978, with some ten million viewers tuning in each day. At its height, core actors such as Helen Wagner, Don MacLaughlin, Don Hastings, and Eileen Fulton became nationally known. Wagner, Hastings, and Fulton are also three of longest serving actors in the history of American soap operas.

The show passed its 10,000th episode on May 12, 1995, and celebrated its 50th anniversary on April 2, 2006. On September 18, 2009, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; became the last remaining Procter &amp; Gamble-produced soap opera for CBS after &quot;Guiding Light&quot; aired its final episode on the network.

On December 8, 2009, CBS announced it was canceling &quot;As the World Turns&quot; after a run of almost 54 years due to low ratings. The show taped its final scenes on June 23, 2010, and its final episode aired on September 17, 2010. Reruns of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; took over the &quot;As the World Turns&quot; time slot between September 20 and October 15, 2010, for four weeks. On October 18, 2010, CBS replaced &quot;As the World Turns&quot; with a new talk show called &quot;The Talk&quot;.

==Premise==
&quot;As the World Turns&quot; was the creation of Irna Phillips, who, beginning in the 1930s, had been one of the foremost creators and writers of radio soap operas. As a writer, Phillips favored character development and psychological realism over melodrama, and her previous creations (which included &quot;Guiding Light&quot;) were especially notable for placing professionals – doctors, lawyers, and clergy – at the center of their storylines. Phillips wrote: &quot;As the world turns, we know the bleakness of winter, the promise of spring, the fullness of summer, and the harvest of autumn—the cycle of life is complete.&quot;

This was therefore shown in &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, with its slow-moving psychological character studies of families headed by legal and medical professionals. The personal and professional lives of doctors and lawyers remained central to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; throughout its run and eventually became standard fare on many soap operas. Whereas the 15-minute radio soaps often focused on one central, heroic character (for example, Dr. Jim Brent in Phillips&#x27; &quot;Road of Life&quot;), the expanded 30-minute format of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; enabled Phillips to introduce a handful of professionals within the framework of a family saga.

Phillips&#x27; style favored gradual evolution over radical change. Slow, conversational, and emotionally intense, the show moved at the pace of life itself – and sometimes even more slowly than that. Each new addition to the cast was done in a gradual manner and was usually a key contact to one of the members of the Hughes family. As such, the show earned a reputation as being quite conservative, though the show did showcase a gay male character in 1988. During the show&#x27;s early decades, the content-related policies of its sponsor Procter &amp; Gamble Productions may have contributed to the perception of conservatism. The household products-manufacturing giant typically frowned on storylines in which adultery and other immoral behavior went unpunished and, as late as the 1980s, characters from the primary families were still generally not allowed to go through with abortions.

==Notable history and accomplishments==
&quot;As the World Turns&quot; premiered on April 2, 1956. It was the first television daytime drama with a 30-minute running time; all daytime dramas until then had 15-minute running times.

The series was also CBS&#x27;s first to expand to a 60-minute running time in 1975. By 1958, the program was the number-one daytime drama in the United States, where it remained until 1978. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series four times in 1987, 1991, 2001, and 2003.

The first words spoken in &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in the first episode (aired on April 2, 1956) were &quot;Good morning, dear&quot;, said by the character Nancy Hughes, played by actress Helen Wagner.

Wagner was acknowledged by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for having the longest run in a single role on television, a position she held until 2010. She did not play the role without interruption - she was temporarily dropped from the series after the first six months due to conflicts with creator Irna Phillips. Wagner also left the series in 1981, when she felt that writers were not interested in the veteran players and returned as a regular character in 1985.

On the episode broadcast on Monday, August 30, 2010, it was revealed that Nancy had died in her sleep; the next day&#x27;s episode dealt with Nancy&#x27;s memorial service. Nancy Hughes&#x27;s memorial aired just two weeks before the series finale. The show&#x27;s producers stated in interviews that they had to revise their plans for the final episode because of Wagner&#x27;s death – they had hoped that Wagner would say the final lines of the last episode just as she had said the first words of the first episode.

==Crossovers==
Several crossovers have been made between &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and other serials:

*1962
**The character Mitchell Dru (Geoffrey Lumb) was brought to Oakdale after the cancellation of the Procter and Gamble soap &quot;The Brighter Day&quot;. The same character (and actor) was then transferred to a new P&amp;G soap, &quot;Another World&quot;, shortly after its premiere in 1964. &quot;Another World&quot; was originally conceived by Irna Phillips to be a spin-off series of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Like several other characters from &quot;Another World&quot;, Mitchell Dru &quot;crossed over&quot; for one or more performances on the first &quot;Another World&quot; spin-off, &quot;Somerset&quot;, which premiered in March 1970.
*1965
**The character Lisa Miller Hughes (Eileen Fulton) was used as the basis to create a primetime spinoff soap &quot;Our Private World&quot;, (CBS&#x27;s attempt to duplicate the success of rival network ABC&#x27;s &quot;Peyton Place&quot;), with Lisa leaving Oakdale and moving to Chicago, where she married wealthy John Eldridge, but had an affair with his brother Thomas. Though &quot;Our Private World&quot; only lasted a few months, and Fulton returned to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in early 1966, after taking a few months off, remnants of Lisa&#x27;s time on &quot;Our Private World&quot; were resurrected 26 years later, when it was revealed in 1992 that Lisa had had a son off-camera, hitherto unknown to viewers, before returning to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in 1966. Her son Scott Eldridge tracked her down as an adult and remained on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; for several years.
*1999–2003
**Shortly after NBC canceled &quot;Another World&quot; on April 12, 1999, with the series finale that aired on June 25 of the same year, the characters of Cass and Lila Winthrop (Stephen Schnetzer and Lisa Peluso), and Jake and Victoria McKinnon (Tom Eplin and Jensen Buchanan) crossed over to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; briefly. Jake and Vicky intended to move to Oakdale, but Vicky was soon killed off in September 1999, then appeared as a ghost to Jake and Molly from November 2000 to February 2001. Cass only appeared on a recurring basis through 2003 (usually whenever anyone in Oakdale needed an attorney other than resident lawyer Tom Hughes), and Jake (Tom Eplin) remained as a regular on the series until his character was killed off in 2002. Cindy Brooke Harrison (Kim Rhodes) also had minor appearances in 2000 and 2001. Vicky&#x27;s mother and twin sister, Donna (Anna Stuart) and Marley (Ellen Wheeler, who at the time also directed episodes of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;), made recurring appearances from 2000 to 2002, and left the show when they gained custody of Jake and Vicky&#x27;s twin daughters after Jake&#x27;s death. There were also plans to have a now-teenage Steven Frame (Vicky&#x27;s son with Jamie Frame) come to Oakdale and live with Jake, but the character was reconceived as teenage Bryant Montgomery, the son of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; couple Craig and Sierra.

Since 2005, a number of characters have crossed back and forth between &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;:

*2005
**&quot;As the World Turns&quot;: At the request of Oakdale, Illinois, District Attorney Jessica Griffin, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc) traveled there to serve as the attorney for Jack Snyder (Michael Park) in a custody hearing involving his late wife Julia Larabee&#x27;s son, JJ. (April 4 – 05, 2005).

The irony in his appearance in the above-mentioned episodes is that 20 years before, LeBlanc left the role of Kirk McColl, the youngest son of Lisa&#x27;s fifth husband, Whit McColl (played by &quot;Wagon Train&quot; star Robert Horton, who was killed off shortly before Fulton&#x27;s return to the show). So, to many long-time fans of both &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, seeing LeBlanc as the character from the latter show was weird. History was also made during LeBlanc&#x27;s appearance on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, since both shows are made by different production companies (Bell Dramatic Serial Company for &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;; Procter and Gamble for &quot;As the World Turns&quot;), although they are on the same network.

*2007
**&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;: Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) called on her friend Alison Stewart (Marnie Schulenburg) to help trick Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) into marriage. After Amber drugged Cane, Alison dressed up as him for the wedding service. (February 22, 2007)
**&quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;: Emily Stewart (Kelley Menighan Hensley) traveled from Oakdale, Illinois, to Genoa City, Wisconsin, in search of information on her sister, Alison Stewart (Marnie Schulenburg). Emily met with Amber Moore (Adrienne Frantz) at the Crimson Lights Coffeehouse, but Amber denied knowing Alison&#x27;s whereabouts. After Emily was gone, Amber placed a call to Alison as a heads-up. 
*2009–10
On December 8, 2009, CBS canceled &quot;As the World Turns&quot; after almost 54 years, with the series finale airing on September 17, 2010, making it the last Procter &amp; Gamble soap opera to end.

==President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination==

On November 22, 1963, the live CBS broadcast of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; began as always, at 1:30 EST. In this episode, the Hughes family was discussing plans for Thanksgiving. Ten minutes later, a &quot;CBS News Bulletin&quot; slide suddenly appeared on the screen and Walter Cronkite gave the first report of shots being fired at the motorcade in which President Kennedy was travelling.

At the end of this bulletin, CBS rejoined &quot;As the World Turns&quot; which was still in progress. The cast, performing the episode live, was not yet aware of the rapidly-developing situation. However, just before Don Hastings and Henderson Forsythe began the third scene of the show, Hastings overheard cameraman Phil Polansky talking to the control room through a headset: &quot;Don&#x27;t tell the actors what? The President&#x27;s been shot?&quot; The actors received their cues and began the scene while Walter Cronkite was in the midst of reporting further information from Dallas. CBS then returned to the show in the middle of the third scene, which would be the last regular program viewed by the television audience that day. During the commercial break that followed, the &quot;CBS News Bulletin&quot; slide appeared again and Cronkite resumed with audio-only reports of the developments in Dallas until the top of the hour when CBS News was ready to go on the air with video. Once the episode came to a close with Eileen Fulton in the final scene, the cast was finally informed of the news.

As NBC and ABC, the other two major U.S. TV networks, were not programming in that timeslot then (the 1:30–2:00 ET period belonging to their local affiliates), &quot;As the World Turns&quot; has the distinction of being the last regular U.S. network program broadcast for the next four days as the assassination and funeral of President Kennedy and the transition of power to President Lyndon B. Johnson took center stage.

==Broadcast history==

&quot;As the World Turns&quot; enjoyed a virtually uninterrupted reign as the highest-rated soap from 1958 to 1978, tying for first place with NBC Daytime&#x27;s &quot;Another World&quot; (1973–1974, 1977–1978) and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (1973–1974). By the mid-1960s, it was so firmly entrenched that its strongest competition, &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, despite developing a devoted fan base in its own right and becoming one of daytime&#x27;s most popular game shows, could not come close to matching it in the Nielsens.

Its strength was such that ABC ran hour-long drama reruns in the 1:00–2:00 pm. (noon–1:00 Central) slot in the mid-1960s and NBC, after losing &quot;Deal&quot; to ABC in 1968, ran a total of eight shows, all short-lived (with the exception of &quot;Three on a Match&quot;, which lasted three years), against &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; from that point until 1975.

As that year began, &quot;Another World&quot; was expanded to 60 minutes, with its first hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, as the two shows were not in competition for anything other than the overall ratings win, CBS&#x27; afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of two popular afternoon game shows, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot;. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of &quot;Another World&quot; had brought to the network, elected to do the same thing with &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; beginning on April 21, 1975; this put &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring six and a half years after the last two 15-minute serials, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, expanded to 30 minutes.

CBS considered expanding &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; to 45 minutes (eliminating the timeslot during which stations broadcast local or syndicated programs), but eventually decided to expand &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, its front-runner in the ratings battle, to a full-hour length. Initially, in order to free up the necessary 30 minutes to do so, CBS returned &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which had been paired with &quot;Match Game&quot; for the previous two years as part of the network&#x27;s successful 3 p.m. game show block, to the morning. However, CBS changed course and decided that it would also attempt an expansion of &quot;Price&quot; to 60 minutes; this meant that, if the plans to expand &quot;As the World Turns&quot; were to go as anticipated, CBS would need to cancel a program to free up that 30 minutes of airtime it needed.

At the time CBS was having ratings trouble with &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;. Procter &amp; Gamble had demanded that CBS give the serial the 2:30 p.m. slot following &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; in 1972, moving it from the 3:30 p.m. slot it had held since 1963. This decision proved to be a grave mistake. &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, which had a much younger and more male-centric audience than almost any other serial on television when the move was made, lost a large portion of its audience, especially to NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Doctors,&quot; at the height of its popularity at the time. In addition, the rest of CBS&#x27; drama lineup was performing well in the ratings and the network could not move the long-running serial to another timeslot without risking preemption from local affiliates, which would almost certainly have driven ratings even lower.

At the same time, ABC expressed interest in picking up &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; for its own lineup as it had been interested in carrying a P&amp;G-produced serial for some time, supplementing its in-house productions. An agreement was struck between CBS, Procter &amp; Gamble, and ABC to get the necessary 30 minutes for the &quot;As the World Turns&quot; expansion. CBS would not renew &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; once its contract was up, Procter &amp; Gamble would move the serial to ABC, and thus &quot;As the World Turns&quot; could go ahead with its expansion.

However, a major issue arose that halted the planned shuffle. CBS was contracted to air &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; until December 1975, and ABC had no place in its schedule to put it at the time. This forced CBS to temporarily postpone expanding &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and keep &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; until ABC could find a timeslot for it. Finally, in November, ABC agreed that &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; would join its lineup on December 1, replacing the game show &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot; at 4:00 p.m. (closer to its pre-1972 timeslots) and keeping the serial&#x27;s continuity intact. And thus, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; became CBS&#x27; first 60-minute daytime serial.

The first half of the newly-expanded show continued to perform well against &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; on ABC, which the network moved to the noon/11 a.m. timeslot within four weeks of the expansion. The second half put &quot;As the World Turns&quot; in competition with ABC&#x27;s most-popular game show, &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot;, which had done well against &quot;Guiding Light&quot; since the network moved it to 2:00 p.m. in December 1974 and kept doing so against &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Although the expansion was not a complete success, at the end of the season, the serial was again at the top of the daytime Nielsens, despite a 1.4-point drop from the year before.

Although the eventual hit game show &quot;Family Feud&quot; ran against &quot;As The World Turns&quot; from July 12, 1976 until April 22, 1977, it did not become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap with &quot;All My Children&quot; did trouble really begin for &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and NBC&#x27;s ( &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;), since ABC kept that serial&#x27;s starting time at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss the last half of that day&#x27;s storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the &quot;As the World Turns&quot; or &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; activities from the episode&#x27;s beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after, rather than exactly at, the bottom of the hour). Further, &quot;All My Children&quot;″s emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier storylines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical &quot;Days&quot;). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to the 2:00 PM/1:00 p.m. starting time, compounding the other networks&#x27; headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from the top spot in the ratings at the end of the 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with &quot;Another World&quot; for number one in the Nielsens, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; fell to fourth behind &quot;All My Children&quot;, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

On February 4, 1980, CBS moved and expanded &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; to a full hour after the cancellation of the long-tenured &quot;Love of Life&quot;. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; moved from noon/11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m./noon (the former affiliate break timeslot) and &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was bumped up to 2:00/1:00 p.m. and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; to 3:00/2:00 p.m. On June 8, 1981, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; returned to its traditional 1:30/12:30 p.m. start time with &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; following at 2:30/1:30 p.m. and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; leading off the serial lineup at either noon/11:00 a.m. or 12:30 p.m./11:30 a.m. (depending on affiliate preference).

&quot;As the World Turns&quot; remained at 1:30/12:30 p.m. until March 20, 1987, when CBS cancelled the five-year-old &quot;Capitol&quot; in favor of &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. CBS scheduled it at 1:30/12:30 p.m., and finally settled &quot;As the World Turns&quot; at 2:00/1:00 p.m., where it remained until its final network episode in September 2010. Although facing the full length of &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; once again, the Douglas Marland era of 1985 to 1993 had a resurgence in ratings, and by 1991, it was back in its once-habitual top-four placing. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; survived NBC&#x27;s cancellation of its sister series &quot;Another World&quot; in 1999.

===Cancellation and final episode===
On December 8, 2009, CBS confirmed that it would not renew &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. The final CBS episode was taped on June 23, 2010, at JC Studios in Brooklyn, and aired on September 17, 2010. The final scene showed Dr. Bob Hughes (played by Don Hastings) retiring from Oakdale Memorial Hospital. In the scene, Bob is packing up his office and talking to his wife, Kim Hughes (Kathryn Hays). She leaves and tells Bob to take as much time as he needed to say goodbye. Bob looked around, put his nameplate in his briefcase, and spoke the show&#x27;s final line, &quot;Good night.&quot; That line was a bookend to the beginning of the show in 1956, and the first line spoken, &quot;Good morning.&quot; The camera panned to the globe on Bob&#x27;s desk spinning - a reference to the show&#x27;s title - before the final fade-out.

==International broadcast==

In South Africa, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; aired on SABC2 from June 2010 to February 2012 from 14:10 to 15:00 each weekday. Episodes were four years behind the original U.S. broadcast. In Canada, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; aired on ONtv, and, later, Global Television Network, and on NTV in Newfoundland and Labrador. In Jamaica, &quot;As The World Turns&quot; started airing on Television Jamaica Monday to Friday 1:00pm beginning in 2011. In Belize, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was seen on Great Belize Television at 2:00 pm Central Time, usually the same day as the U.S. telecasts. In New Zealand, &quot;As The World Turns&quot; was aired on TVNZ 1 from 1962 to 1989.

In the Netherlands, &quot;As The World Turns&quot; was popular and aired for more than 20 years. From 1989 till its cancellation, it was the best watched daytime soap. In 2010 Terri Conn, Martha Byrne, Marnie Schulenburg, Trent Dawson, Grayson McCouch and Van Hansis visited the Netherlands and were special guests at the &quot;Farewell ATWT&quot; meeting. Elizabeth Hubbard even guest-starred in the Dutch soap &quot;Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden&quot; for a while, after the cancellation of ATWT.

==&quot;InTurn&quot;==
In 2006, CBS launched a reality show called &quot;InTurn&quot; on their broadband channel innertube, the winner of which would go on to receive a 13-week acting contract on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. The eventual winner of InTurn was Alex Charak, an 18-year-old &quot;Student/Pizza Transportation Artist&quot; from New York. Charak made his debut as the character Elwood Hoffman on September 26, 2006. A one-hour &quot;best-of&quot; show aired on CBS on November 24, 2006.

CBS launched &quot;InTurn 2&quot; in the summer of 2007. For the new season, the age restrictions expanded to allow for middle-aged viewers to participate, and there were nine competitors instead of eight. The winner of the second season was Ryan Serhant, a recent graduate of Hamilton College. Serhant made his debut in the contract role on November 7, 2007. He plays Evan Walsh IV, son of Evan Walsh III. He is a young hotshot biochemist prodigy who comes home to Oakdale to try to convince Craig Montgomery to invest in the cutting edge biomedical tech field. He began taping on September 24, 2007, two days after the close of his off-Broadway play &quot;Purple Hearts&quot;.

&quot;Inturn 3&quot; began airing in April 2008 and featured 17 episodes.

<doc id="191603" wikidata="Q7750990" url="?curid=191603" title="The Men Behind the Wire">
<text>&quot;The Men Behind the Wire&quot; is a song written and composed by Paddy McGuigan of the Barleycorn folk group in the aftermath of Operation Demetrius. The song describes police raids in Northern Ireland by British security forces during the Troubles, and the &quot;men behind the wire&quot; refers to those interned without trial at HM Prison Maze, HM Prison Magilligan and onboard HMS &quot;Maidstone&quot;.

The song was recorded by the Barleycorn in Belfast (produced by Billy McBurney) and pressed in Dublin by Release Records in December 1971. After its release on 14 December the song shot into the Irish charts, selling far more copies than any other single until then released in Ireland, and remained in the charts for months. It reached No. 1 position in the Irish charts on 22 January 1972, where it remained for three weeks. After a gap of one week it returned to No. 1 for two weeks on 15 February. Royalties from the recording were donated to families of the internees.

The song was subsequently recorded by many singers and bands in Ireland and abroad, including the Wolfe Tones, Liam Clancy and the Flying Column. British singer/songwriter Dido in her song &quot;Let&#x27;s Do the Things We Normally Do&quot; from the album &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot; used a few lines from this song. This included the lyrics &quot;Armoured cars and tanks and guns, came to take away our sons. But every man must stand behind, the men behind the wire.&quot;

<text>A tweeter or treble speaker is a special type of loudspeaker (usually dome, inverse dome or horn-type) that is designed to produce high audio frequencies, typically up to 100 kHz. The name is derived from the high pitched sounds made by some birds (tweets), especially in contrast to the low woofs made by many dogs, after which low-frequency drivers are named (woofers).

== Operation ==

Nearly all tweeters are electrodynamic drivers using a voice coil suspended within a fixed magnetic field. These designs operate by applying current from the output of an amplifier circuit to a coil of wire called a voice coil. The voice coil produces a varying magnetic field, which works against the fixed magnetic field of a permanent magnet around which the cylindrical voice coil is suspended, forcing the voice coil and the diaphragm attached to it to move. This mechanical movement resembles the waveform of the electronic signal supplied from the amplifier&#x27;s output to the voice coil. Since the coil is attached to a diaphragm, the vibratory motion of the voice coil transmits to the diaphragm; the diaphragm in turn vibrates the air, thus creating air motions or audio waves, which is heard as high sounds.

Modern tweeters are typically different from older tweeters, which were usually small versions of woofers. As tweeter technology has advanced, different design applications have become popular. Many soft dome tweeter diaphragms are thermoformed from polyester film, or silk or polyester fabric that has been impregnated with a polymer resin. Hard dome tweeters are usually made of aluminium, aluminium-magnesium alloys, or titanium.

Tweeters are intended to convert an electrical signal into mechanical air movement with nothing added or subtracted, but the process is imperfect, and real-world tweeters involve tradeoffs. Among the challenges in tweeter design and manufacture are: providing adequate damping, to stop the dome&#x27;s motion rapidly when the signal ends; ensuring suspension linearity, allowing high output at the low end of its frequency range; ensuring freedom from contact with the magnet assembly, keeping the dome centered as it moves; and providing adequate power handling without adding excessive mass. Tweeters contribute to a well-balanced and rich audio experience by focusing on the higher sound frequencies.

Tweeters can also work in collaboration with the woofers that are responsible for generating the low frequencies or bass. 

Some tweeters sit outside the main enclosure in their own semi-independent unit, such as &quot;super tweeters&quot;. The latter plugs in and swivels to adjust the soundfield depending on listener position and user preference. The separation from the baffle is considered to be optimal under the theory that the smallest baffle possible is optimal for tweeters.

==Range==
Most tweeters are designed to reproduce frequencies up to the formally defined upper limit of the human hearing range (typically listed as 20 kHz); some operate at frequencies up to approximately in between 5 kHz to 20 kHz. Tweeters with a greater upper range have been designed for psychoacoustic testing, for extended-range digital audio such as Super Audio CD intended for audiophiles, for biologists performing research on animal response to sounds, and for ambient sound systems in zoos. Ribbon tweeters have been made that can reproduce 80 kHz and even 100 kHz.

== Dome materials ==
All dome materials have advantages and disadvantages. Three properties designers look for in domes are low mass, high stiffness and good damping. Celestion were the first manufacturers to fabricate dome tweeters out of a metal, copper. Nowadays other metals such as aluminium, titanium, magnesium, and beryllium, as well as various alloys thereof, are used, being both light and stiff but having low damping; their resonant modes occur above 20 kHz. More exotic materials, such as synthetic diamond, are also being used for their extreme stiffness. Polyethylene terephthalate film and woven silk suffer less ringing, but are not nearly as stiff, which can limit their very high frequency output.

In general, smaller dome tweeters provide wider dispersion of sound at the highest frequencies. However, smaller dome tweeters have less radiating area, which limits their output at the lower end of their range; and they have smaller voice coils, which limit their overall power output.

== Ferrofluid ==
Ferrofluid is a suspension of very small (typically 10 nm) iron oxide magnetic particles in a very low volatility liquid, typically a synthetic oil. A wide range of viscosity and magnetic density variants allow designers to add damping, cooling, or both. Ferrofluid also aids in centering the voice coil in the magnetic gap, reducing distortion. The fluid is typically injected into the magnetic gap and is held in place by the strong magnetic field. If a tweeter has been subjected to elevated power levels, some thickening of the ferrofluid occurs, as a portion of the carrier liquid evaporates. In extreme cases, this can degrade the sound quality and output level of a tweeter, and the fluid must be removed and new fluid installed.

== Professional sound applications ==
Tweeters designed for sound reinforcement and musical instrument applications are broadly similar to high fidelity tweeters, though they are usually not referred to as tweeters, but rather as &quot;high frequency drivers&quot;. Key design requirement differences are: mountings built for repeated shipping and handling, drivers often mounted to horn structures to provide for higher sound levels and greater control of sound dispersion, and more robust voice coils to withstand the higher power levels typically encountered. High frequency drivers in PA horns are often referred to as &quot;compression drivers&quot; from the mode of acoustic coupling between the driver diaphragm and the horn throat.

Various materials are used in the construction of compression driver diaphragms including titanium, aluminium, phenolic impregnated fabric, polyimide and PET film, each having its own characteristics. The diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former, typically made from a different material from the dome, since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change. Polyimide film, Nomex, and glassfibre are popular for this application. The suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring, which may fit into a groove, over locating pins, or be fastened with machine screws. The diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug, which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat, preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface. The phase plug exits into a tapered tube, which forms the start of the horn itself. This slowly expanding throat within the driver is continued in the horn flare. The horn flare controls the coverage pattern, or directivity, and as an acoustic transformer, adds gain. A professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 dB/watt/meter. This is substantially more efficient (and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former) than other tweeter construction.

==Types of tweeters==
===Cone tweeter===

Cone tweeters have the same basic design and form as a woofer with optimizations to operate at higher frequencies. The optimizations usually are:
* a very small and light cone so it can move rapidly;
* cone materials chosen for stiffness (e.g., ceramic cones in one manufacturer&#x27;s line), or good damping properties (e.g., paper, silk or coated fabric) or both;
* a suspension (or spider) that is stiffer than for other drivers—less flexibility is needed for high frequency reproduction;
* small voice coils (3/4 inch is typical) and light (thin) wire, which also helps the tweeter cone move rapidly.

Cone tweeters were popular in older stereo hi-fi speakers designed and manufactured in the 1960s and 1970s as an alternative to the dome tweeter (which was developed in the late 1950s). Cone tweeters today are often relatively cheap, but many of those in the past were of high quality, such as those made by Audax/Polydax, Bozak, CTS, JBL, Tonegen and SEAS. These vintage cone tweeters exhibited very flat frequency response, low distortion, fast transient response, a low resonance frequency and a gentle low-end roll-off, easing crossover design.

Typical of the 1960s/1970s-era was the CTS &quot;phenolic ring&quot; cone tweeters, exhibiting flat response from 2,000 to 15,000 Hz, low distortion and fast transient response. The CTS &quot;phenolic ring&quot; tweeter gets its name from the orange-colored edge suspension ring that it has which is made from phenolic. It was used in many makes and models of well-regarded vintage speakers, and was a mid-priced unit.

Cone tweeters have a narrower dispersion characteristic that is the same as a cone woofer&#x27;s. Many designers therefore believed this made them a good match to cone midranges and woofers, allowing for superb stereo imaging. However, the &quot;sweet spot&quot; created by the narrow dispersion of cone tweeters is small. Speakers with cone tweeters offered the best stereo imaging when positioned in the room&#x27;s corners, a common practice in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the widespread introduction of higher quality audiophile discs and the advent of the CD caused the cone tweeter to fall out of popularity because cone tweeters seldom extend higher than 15 kHz. Audiophiles felt that cone tweeters lacked the &quot;airiness&quot; of dome tweeters or other types. Nevertheless, many high-end cone tweeters remained in limited production by Audax, JBL and SEAS until the mid-1980s.

Cone tweeters are now rarely used in modern hi-fi usage and are routinely seen in low cost applications such as factory car speakers, compact stereo systems, and boom boxes. Some boutique speaker manufacturers recently have returned to high-end cone tweeters, especially recreations of CTS phenolic ring models, to create a vintage-sounding product.

===Dome tweeter===

A dome tweeter is constructed by attaching a voice coil to a dome (made of woven fabric, thin metal or other suitable material), which is attached to the magnet or the top plate via a low compliance suspension. These tweeters typically do not have a frame or basket, but a simple front plate attached to the magnet assembly. Dome tweeters are categorized by their voice coil diameter, and range from 19 mm (0.75 in), through 38 mm (1.5 in). The overwhelming majority of dome tweeters presently used in hi-fi speakers are 25 mm (1 in) in diameter.

A variation is the ring radiator in which the &#x27;suspension&#x27; of the cone or dome becomes the major radiating element. These tweeters have different directivity characteristics when compared to standard dome tweeters.

===Piezo tweeter===
A piezo (or piezo-electric) tweeter contains a piezoelectric crystal coupled to a mechanical diaphragm. An audio signal is applied to the crystal, which responds by flexing in proportion to the voltage applied across the crystal&#x27;s surfaces, thus converting electrical energy into mechanical.

The conversion of electrical pulses to mechanical vibrations and the conversion of returned mechanical vibrations back into electrical energy is the basis for ultrasonic testing. The active element is the heart of the transducer as it converts the electrical energy to acoustic energy, and vice versa. The active element is basically a piece of polarized material (i.e. some parts of the molecule are positively charged, while other parts of the molecule are negatively charged) with electrodes attached to two of its opposite faces. When an electric field is applied across the material, the polarized molecules will align themselves with the electric field, resulting in induced dipoles within the molecular or crystal structure of the material. This alignment of molecules will cause the material to change dimensions. This phenomenon is known as electrostriction. In addition, a permanently polarized material such as quartz (SiO2) or barium titanate (BaTiO3) will produce an electric field when the material changes dimensions as a result of an imposed mechanical force. This phenomenon is known as the piezoelectric effect.

Piezo tweeters rarely get used in high-end audio because of their low fidelity, although they did feature in some high-end designs of the late ‘70s, such as the Celef PE1 in which they were utilised as a super tweeter in combination with a conventional dome tweeter. They are often used in toys, buzzers, alarms, bass guitar speaker cabinets, cheap computer or stereo speakers and PA horns.

===Ribbon tweeter===
A ribbon tweeter uses a very thin diaphragm (often of aluminum, or perhaps metalized plastic film) that supports a planar coil frequently made by deposition of aluminium vapor, suspended in a powerful magnetic field (typically provided by neodymium magnets) to reproduce high frequencies. The development of ribbon tweeters has more or less followed the development of ribbon microphones. The ribbon is of very lightweight material and so capable of very high acceleration and extended high frequency response. Ribbons have traditionally been incapable of high output (large magnet gaps leading to poor magnetic coupling is the main reason). But higher power versions of ribbon tweeters are becoming common in large-scale sound reinforcement line array systems, which can serve audiences of thousands. They are attractive in these applications since nearly all ribbon tweeters inherently exhibit useful directional properties, with very wide horizontal dispersion (coverage) and very tight vertical dispersion. These drivers can easily be stacked vertically, building a high frequency line array that produces high sound pressure levels much farther away from the speaker locations than do conventional tweeters.

===Planar magnetic tweeter ===

Some loudspeaker designers use a planar magnetic tweeter, sometimes called a quasi-ribbon. Planar magnetic tweeters are generally less expensive than true ribbon tweeters, but are not precisely equivalent as a metal foil ribbon is lighter than the diaphragm in a planar magnetic tweeter and the magnetic structures are different. Usually a thin piece of PET film or plastic with a voice coil wire running numerous times vertically on the material is used. The magnet structure is less expensive than for ribbon tweeters.

=== Electrostatic tweeter ===
An electrostatic tweeter operates on the same principles as a full-range electrostatic speaker or a pair of electrostatic headphones. This type of speaker employs a thin diaphragm (generally plastic and typically PET film), with a thin conductive coating, suspended between two screens or perforated metal sheets, referred to as stators.

The output of the driving amplifier is applied to the primary of a step-up transformer with a center-tapped secondary, and a very high voltage—several hundred to several thousand volts—is applied between the center tap of the transformer and the diaphragm. Electrostatics of this type necessarily include a high voltage power supply to provide the high voltage used. The stators are connected to the remaining terminals of the transformer. When an audio signal is applied to the primary of the transformer, the stators are electrically driven 180 degrees out of phase, alternately attracting and repelling the diaphragm.

An uncommon way of driving an electrostatic speaker without a transformer is to connect the plates of a push-pull vacuum tube amplifier directly to the stators, and the high voltage supply between the diaphragm and ground.

Electrostatics have reduced even-order harmonic distortion because of their push-pull design. They also have minimal phase distortion. The design is quite old (the original patents date to the 1930s), but occupies a very small segment of the market because of high costs, low efficiency, large size for full range designs, and fragility.

===AMT tweeter===
The Air Motion Transformer tweeter works by pushing air out perpendicularly from the pleated diaphragm. Its diaphragm is the folded pleats of film (typically PET film) around aluminium struts held in a strong magnetic field. In past decades, ESS of California produced a series of hybrid loudspeakers using such tweeters, along with conventional woofers, referring to them as Heil transducers after their inventor, Oskar Heil. They are capable of considerable output levels and are rather more sturdy than electrostatics or ribbons, but have similar low-mass moving elements.

Most of the current AMT drivers in use today are similar in efficiency and frequency response to the original Oskar Heil designs of the 1970s.

===Horn tweeter===
A horn tweeter is any of the above tweeters coupled to a flared or horn structure. Horns are used for two purposes — to control dispersion, and to couple the tweeter diaphragm to the air for higher efficiency. The tweeter in either case is usually termed a compression driver and is quite different from more common types of tweeters (see above). Properly used, a horn improves the off-axis response of the tweeter by controlling (i.e., reducing) the directivity of the tweeter. It can also improve the efficiency of the tweeter by coupling the relatively high acoustic impedance of the driver to the lower impedance of the air. The larger the horn, the lower the frequencies at which it can work, since large horns provide coupling to the air at lower frequencies. There are different types of horns, including radial and constant directivity (CD). Horn tweeters may have a somewhat &#x27;different&#x27; sonic signature than simple dome tweeters. Poorly designed horns, or improperly crossed-over horns, have predictable problems in the accuracy of their output, and the load that they present to the amplifier. Perhaps concerned about the image of poorly designed horns, some manufacturers use horn loaded tweeters, but avoid using the term. Their euphemisms include &quot;elliptical aperture&quot; &quot;Semi-horn&quot; and &quot;Directivity controlled&quot;. These are, nonetheless, a form of horn loading.

===Plasma or ion tweeter===
Because ionized gas is electrically charged and so can be manipulated by a variable electrical field, it is possible to use a small sphere of plasma as a tweeter. Such tweeters are called a plasma tweeter or ion tweeter. They can be more complex than other tweeters (plasma generation is not required in other types), but offer the advantage that the moving mass is optimally low - if not relatively massless and so very responsive to the signal input. The early models of these tweeters were not capable of high output, nor of other than very high frequency reproduction, and so are usually used at the throat of a horn structure to manage usable output levels. One disadvantage is that the plasma arc can produce ozone and NOx, poison gases, in small quantities as a by-product. Because of this, German-made Magnat &quot;magnasphere&quot; speakers were banned from import to the United States in the 1980s. Any modern design uses catalysts to reduce the gas output to negligible quantities.

In the past, the dominant manufacturer in the US was DuKane near St Louis, who made the Ionovac; also sold in a UK variant as the Ionophone. Electro-Voice made a model for a short time under license along with DuKane from the inventor Siegfried Klein. These early models were finicky and required regular replacement of the cell in which the plasma was generated (the DuKane unit used a precision machined quartz cell). As a result, they were expensive units in comparison to other designs. Those who have heard the Ionovacs report that, in a sensibly designed loudspeaker system, the highs were &#x27;airy&#x27; and very detailed, though high output wasn&#x27;t possible.

In the 1980s, the Plasmatronics speaker also used a plasma tweeter, though the manufacturer did not stay in business very long and very few of these complex units were sold.

<doc id="191607" wikidata="Q1367025" url="?curid=191607" title="Mid-range speaker">
<text>A mid-range speaker is a loudspeaker driver that reproduces sound in the frequency range from 250 to 2000 Hz.

Mid-range drivers are usually cone types or, less commonly, dome types, or compression horn drivers. The radiating diaphragm of a cone mid-range unit is a truncated cone, with a voice coil attached at the neck, along with the spider portion of the suspension, and with the cone surround at the wide end. Cone mid-range drivers typically resemble small woofers. The most common material used for mid-range cones is paper, occasionally impregnated and/or surface-treated with polymers or resins in order to improve vibrational damping. Other mid-range cone materials include plastics such as polypropylene, Cobex, Bextrene, woven Kevlar, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or light metal alloys based on aluminium, magnesium, titanium, or other alloys. The radiating surface of a dome mid-range is typically a 90-degree section of a sphere, made from cloth, metal, or plastic film, with its suspension and voice coil co-located at the outer edge of the dome. Most professional concert mid-range drivers are compression drivers coupled to horns. A very few mid-ranges are electrostatic drivers, planar magnetic drivers, or ribbon drivers.

A mid-range driver is called upon to handle the most significant part of the audible sound spectrum, the region where the most fundamental frequencies are emitted by musical instruments, and, most importantly, the human voice, lie. This region contains most sounds that are the most familiar to the human ear, and where discrepancies from faithful reproduction are most easily observed. It is therefore paramount that a mid-range driver of good quality be capable of low-distortion reproduction.

Most television sets and small radios, especially AM receivers, have only a single mid-range driver, or two for stereo sound. With human speech being the most important aspect of television audio and AM radio, it works out well. Since the ear is most sensitive to the middle frequencies produced by a mid-range the driver and amplifier can both be low power, while still delivering what is perceived to be good sound both in terms of volume and quality.

==Installation issues==
Mid-range drivers are usually used in three-way multi-driver speaker systems. There are therefore special considerations involved in the acoustic join between the mid-range and both the low frequency (woofers) and the high frequency drivers (tweeters). The nature of the drivers on both sides of the mid-range, and the mid-range itself affect the selection of crossover frequency and slope. Nearly all crossovers are passive circuits, designed to match the characteristics of the drivers and their mounting, and are built of capacitors, inductors, and resistors. Active or &#x27;electronic&#x27; crossovers are used in some high performance hi-fi speakers, and in professional sound reinforcement systems. 

Placement of the mid-range (and tweeter) drivers on the enclosure baffle significantly affect the output of the driver, and the material surrounding the mid-range and tweeter drivers on the baffle can produce (or inhibit) reflections of energy from the baffle face, or other items, further influencing the output. Grilles, especially those with structural frames, can further modify the output of the entire speaker system. One of the terms used in design circles to describe some of these diffraction and reflection artifacts is the &quot;baffle step&quot; effect.

When a mid-range speaker is mounted in the same box as a woofer, it will have its own small sub-enclosure, or a sealed back, to prevent the woofer&#x27;s backwave radiation into the box from affecting the mid-range&#x27;s cone or dome motion.

<text>A woofer or bass speaker is a technical term for a loudspeaker driver designed to produce low frequency sounds, typically from 20 Hz up to a few hundred Hz. The name is from the onomatopoeic English word for a dog&#x27;s deep bark, &quot;woof&quot; (in contrast to a &quot;tweeter&quot;, the name used for loudspeakers designed to reproduce high-frequency sounds, deriving from the shrill calls of birds, &quot;tweets&quot;). The most common design for a woofer is the electrodynamic driver, which typically uses a stiff paper cone, driven by a voice coil surrounded by a magnetic field.

The voice coil is attached by adhesives to the back of the loudspeaker cone. The voice coil and the magnet form a linear electric motor. When current flows through the voice coil, the coil moves in relation to the frame according to Fleming&#x27;s left hand rule for motors, causing the coil to push or pull on the driver cone in a piston-like way. The resulting motion of the cone creates sound waves, as it moves in and out.

At ordinary sound pressure levels (SPL), most humans can hear down to about 20 Hz. Woofers are generally used to cover the lowest octaves of a loudspeaker&#x27;s frequency range. In two-way loudspeaker systems, the drivers handling the lower frequencies are also obliged to cover a substantial part of the midrange, often as high as 800 to 1000 Hz; such drivers are commonly termed mid woofers. Since the 1990s, a type of woofer which is designed for very low frequencies only, the subwoofer, has come to be commonly used in home theater systems and PA systems to augment the bass response; subwoofers usually handle the very lowest two or three octaves (i.e., from as low as 20 to 80 or 120 Hz).

== Woofer design ==

Good woofer design requires effectively converting a low frequency amplifier signal to mechanical air movement with high fidelity and acceptable efficiency, and is both assisted and complicated by the necessity of using a loudspeaker enclosure to couple the cone motion to the air. If done well, many of the other problems of woofer design (for instance, linear excursion requirements) are reduced.

In most cases the woofer and its enclosure must be designed to work together. Usually the enclosure is designed to suit the characteristics of the speaker or speakers used. The size of the enclosure is a function of the longest wavelengths (lowest frequencies) to be reproduced, and the woofer enclosure is much larger than required for midrange and high frequencies.

A crossover network, either passive or active, filters the band of frequencies to be handled by the woofer and other speakers. Normally the crossover and speaker system, including the woofer, are expected to convert the electrical signal supplied by the amplifier to an acoustic signal of identical waveform without other interaction between the amplifier and speakers, although sometimes the amplifier and speakers are designed together with the speakers supplying distortion-correcting negative feedback to the amplifier.

There are many challenges in woofer design and manufacture. Most have to do with controlling the motion of the cone so the electrical signal to the woofer&#x27;s voice coil is faithfully reproduced by the sound waves produced by the cone&#x27;s motion. Problems include damping the cone cleanly without audible distortion so that it does not continue to move, causing ringing, when the instantaneous input signal falls to zero each cycle, and managing high excursions (usually required to reproduce loud sounds) with low distortion. There are also challenges in presenting to the amplifier an electrical impedance which is not too far from constant at all frequencies.

An early version of the now widely used bass-reflex cabinet design was patented by Albert L. Thuras of Bell Laboratories in 1932.

==Active loudspeakers==
In 1965, Sennheiser Electronics introduced the Philharmonic sound system, which used electronics to overcome some of the problems ordinary woofer subsystems confront. They added a motion sensor to the woofer, and used the signal corresponding to its actual motion to feedback as a control input to a specially designed amplifier. If carefully done, this can improve performance (both in &#x27;tightness&#x27;, and extension of low frequency performance) considerably at the expense of flexibility (the amplifier and the speaker are tied together permanently) and cost. In the US, L W Erath, an oil industry engineer, introduced a line of high end speakers along very much the same lines.

As electronics costs have decreased, it has become common to have sensor-equipped woofers in inexpensive &#x27;music systems&#x27;, boom boxes, or even car audio systems. This is usually done in an attempt to get better performance from inexpensive or undersized drivers in lightweight or poorly designed enclosures. This approach presents difficulties as not all distortion can be eliminated using servo techniques, and a poorly designed enclosure can swamp the benefits from any attempt at electronic correction.

===Equalized loudspeakers===
Because the characteristics of a loudspeaker can be measured, and to a considerable extent predicted, it is possible to design special circuitry that somewhat compensates for the deficiencies of a speaker system.

Equalization techniques are used in most public address and sound reinforcement applications. Here, the problem is not primarily hi-fi reproduction, but managing the acoustic environment. In this case, the equalization must be individually adjusted to match the particular characteristics of the loudspeaker systems used and the room in which they are used.

==Digital filtering crossover and equalization==
Computer techniques, in particular digital signal processing (DSP), make possible a higher precision crossover. By using finite impulse response (FIR) and other digital techniques, the crossovers for a bi-amped or tri-amped system can be accomplished with a precision not possible with analog filters, whether passive or active. Furthermore, many driver peculiarities (down to and including individual variances) can be remedied at the same time such as in Klein and Hummel&#x27;s recent designs. This approach is complex and thus not likely to be used in lower cost equipment.

== Cone materials ==
All cone materials have advantages and disadvantages. The three chief properties designers look for in cones are light weight, stiffness, and lack of coloration (due to absence of ringing). Exotic materials like Kevlar and magnesium are light and stiff, but can have ringing problems, depending on their fabrication and design. Materials like paper (including coated paper cones) and various polymers will generally ring less than metal diaphragms, but can be heavier and not as stiff. There have been good and bad woofers made with every type of cone material. Almost every kind of material has been used for cones, from glass fiber, bamboo fiber, to expanded aluminum honeycomb sandwiches, and mica-loaded plastic cones.

== Frame design==
The frame, or basket, is the structure holding the cone, voice coil and magnet in the proper alignment. Since the voice coil gap is quite narrow (clearances are typically in the low thousandths of an inch), rigidity is important to prevent rubbing of the voice coil against the magnet structure in the gap and also avoid extraneous motions. There are two main metal frame types, stamped and cast. Stamped baskets (usually of steel) are a lower-cost approach. The disadvantage of this type of frame is that the basket may flex if the speaker is driven at high volumes, there being resistance to bending only in certain directions. Cast baskets are more expensive, but are usually more rigid in all directions, have better damping (reducing their own resonance), can have more intricate shapes, and are therefore usually preferred for higher quality drivers.

== Power handling ==
An important woofer specification is its power rating, the amount of power the woofer can handle without damage. The electrical power rating is not easily characterized and many manufacturers cite peak ratings attainable only for very brief moments without damage. Woofer power ratings become important when the speaker is pushed to extremes: applications requiring high output, amplifier overload conditions, unusual signals (i.e., non-musical ones), very low frequencies at which the enclosure provides little or no acoustic loading (and so there will be maximum cone excursion), or amplifier failure. In high-volume situations, a woofer&#x27;s voice coil will heat up, increase its resistance, causing &quot;power compression&quot;, a condition where output sound power level decreases after extended high power activity. Further heating can physically distort the voice coil, causing scuffing, shorting due to wire insulation deterioration, or other electrical or mechanical damage. Sudden impulse energy can melt a section of voice coil wire, causing an open circuit and a dead woofer; the necessary level will vary with driver characteristics. In normal listening level music applications, the electrical power rating of woofers is generally unimportant; it remains important for higher frequency drivers.

There are three types of power handling in loudspeaker drivers, including woofers: thermal (heat), electrical (both covered above), and mechanical. The mechanical power handling limit is reached when cone excursion extends to its maximum limit. Thermal power handling limits may be reached when fairly high power levels are fed to a woofer for too long, even if not exceeding mechanical limits at any time. Most of the energy applied to the voice coil is converted to heat, not sound; all of the heat is ultimately passed to the pole piece, the rest of the magnet structure, and the frame. From the woofer structure, the heat is eventually dissipated into the surrounding air. Some drivers include provisions for better cooling (e.g., vented magnet pole pieces, dedicated heat conduction structures) to reduce increased coil/magnet/frame temperatures during operation, especially high power level conditions. If too much power is applied to the voice coil as compared to its ability to shed heat, it will eventually exceed a maximum safe temperature. Adhesives can melt, the voice coil former can melt or distort, or the insulation separating the voice coil windings can fail. Each of these events will damage the woofer, perhaps beyond usability.

== Public address (PA) and instrument applications ==
Woofers designed for public address system (PA) and instrument amplifier applications are similar in makeup to home audio woofers, except that they are usually designed more ruggedly. Typically, design variances include: cabinets built for repeated shipping and handling, larger woofer cones to allow for higher sound pressure levels, more robust voice coils to withstand higher power, and higher suspension stiffness. Generally, a home woofer used in a PA/instrument application can be expected to fail more quickly than a PA/instrument woofer. On the other hand, a PA/instrument woofer in a home audio application will not have the same quality of performance, particularly at low volumes. A PA woofer will not produce the same audible high fidelity which is the goal of high quality home audio due to those differences.

PA system woofers typically have high efficiency and high power handling capacity. The trade-off for high efficiency at reasonable cost is usually relatively low excursion capability (i.e., inability to move &quot;in and out&quot; as far as many home woofers can), as they are intended for horn or large reflex enclosures. They are also usually ill-suited to extended low bass response since the last octave of low frequency response increases size and expense considerably, and is increasingly uneconomic to attempt at high levels as in a PA application. A home stereo woofer, because it is used at relatively low volumes, may be able to handle very low frequencies. Because of this, most PA woofers are not well suited to use in high quality high fidelity home applications, and vice versa.

== Frequency ranges ==

At ordinary sound pressure levels, most humans can hear down to about 20 Hz. To accurately reproduce the lowest tones, a woofer, or group of woofers, must move an appropriately large volume of air ⁠— ⁠a task that becomes more difficult at lower frequencies. The larger the room, the more air the woofer&#x27;s movement will have to displace in order to produce the required sound power at low frequencies.

<text>Divine Liturgy () or Holy Liturgy is the usual name used in most Eastern Christian rites for the Eucharistic service.

The Greek Catholic and Orthodox Churches see the Divine Liturgy as transcending time and the world. All believers are seen as united in worship in the Kingdom of God along with the departed saints and the angels of heaven. Everything in the liturgy is seen as symbolic, but not merely so, for it makes present the unseen reality. According to Eastern tradition and belief, the liturgy&#x27;s roots go back to the adaptation of Jewish liturgy by Early Christians. The first part, termed the &quot;Liturgy of the Catechumens&quot;, includes like a synagogue service the reading of scriptures and, in some places, perhaps a sermon/homily. The second half is based on the Last Supper and the first Eucharistic celebrations by Early Christians and it is called &quot;Liturgy of the Faithful&quot;. Eastern Christians believe that the Eucharist is the central part of the service in which they participate, as they believe the bread and wine truly become the real Body and Blood of Christ, and that by partaking of it they jointly become the Body of Christ (that is, the Church). Each Liturgy has its differences from others, but most are very similar to each other with adaptations based on tradition, purpose, culture and theology.

== Byzantine Rite ==

Three Divine Liturgies are in common use in the Byzantine Rite:
* The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (5th century), used on most days of the year and as a vesperal liturgy on the Annunciation.
* The Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great (4th century), used on the five Sundays of Great Lent and on Saint Basil&#x27;s feast day (January 1). On the eves of the Nativity and Theophany and on Holy Thursday and Holy Saturday, it is celebrated as a vesperal liturgy. In some traditions, Saint Basil&#x27;s Liturgy is also celebrated on the Exaltation of the Life-giving Cross on September 14. In all, this liturgy is used 10 times during the liturgical year.
* The Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts (6th century) is used during Great Lent on Wednesdays, Fridays, and a handful of other occasions, and also on the first three days of Holy Week. Nowadays it is always celebrated as a vesperal liturgy; the Liturgy of the Faithful has no Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer), the Holy Gifts having been consecrated and reserved (&quot;presanctified&quot;) at a previous Divine Liturgy. It is traditionally attributed to St. Gregory the Dialogist, although some scholars believe it originated with Patriarch Severus of Antioch.

As well as these, there are two others that are used locally and rarely, the Liturgy of St. James and the Liturgy of Saint Mark.

=== The Hierarchical Liturgy ===

As numbers in a diocese increased dramatically, the bishop who presides over the Eucharistic assembly appointed presbyters to act as celebrants in the local communities (the parishes). Still, the Church is understood in Eastern Orthodoxy in terms not of the presbyter, but the diocesan bishop. When the latter celebrates the liturgy personally, the service is more complex and festive. To demonstrate unity with the greater Orthodox community, the hierarch commemorates the hierarch he is subordinate to or, if he is head of an autocephalous church, he commemorates all his peers, whose names he reads from a diptych.

=== Typical structure ===
:&quot;Note: Psalms are numbered according to the Greek Septuagint. For the Hebrew Masoretic numbering that is more familiar in the West, usually add &#x27;1&#x27;. (See the main Psalms article for an exact correspondence table.)&quot;
The format of Divine Liturgy is fixed, although the specific readings and hymns vary with season and feast.

The Divine Liturgy consists of three interrelated parts; when not in conjunction with vespers, the liturgies of John Chrysostom and Basil the Great are structured thus:

* the Liturgy of Preparation, which includes the entry and vesting prayers of the priests and deacons and the Prothesis;
* the Liturgy of the Catechumens, so called because traditionally this is the only part they may attend;
* the Liturgy of the Faithful, so called because in ancient times only baptized members in good standing were allowed to participate. In modern times, this restriction applies only to Holy Communion – reception of the sacrament of holy communion.

A typical celebration of the Byzantine Liturgy consists of:

==== Liturgy of Preparation ====
&quot;This part of the Liturgy is private, performed only by the priest and deacon. It symbolizes the hidden years of Christ&#x27;s earthly life.&quot;
*Entrance and vesting prayers, the sacred servers (priests and deacons) enter the church, venerate the icons and put on their vestments.
*Liturgy of Preparation – the priest and deacon prepare the bread and wine for the Eucharist (see prosphora) at the Table of Oblation (Prothesis), concluding with the &quot;great censing&quot; when the deacon(s) cense the entire church.
*Kairos – a preliminary dialog takes place between the priest and the deacon.

==== Liturgy of the Catechumens ====
This is the public part of the Liturgy, in which both catechumens and baptized faithful would be in the nave:

* Opening blessing
** The deacon exclaims, &quot;Bless, Master!&quot;
**The priest, raising the Gospel Book and making the sign of the cross with it over the Altar, proclaims: &quot;Blessed is the kingdom of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages&quot;, to which the response is &quot;Amen.&quot;

When the liturgy is at the usual time (following matins or the sixth hour), this order is followed:
* Great Litany, beginning with the deacon proclaiming, &quot;In peace, let us pray to the Lord&quot;, to which the response is &quot;Lord, have mercy.&quot;
* First Antiphon (often Psalm 102, unless there are Festal antiphons, in which case the refrain is &quot;Through the prayers of the Theotokos, O Saviour, save us.&quot;)
* Little Litany
* Second Antiphon (often Psalm 145, unless there are Festal antiphons, in which case the refrain is typically &quot;O Son of God who...[characteristic phrase from the Introit]...save us who sing to Thee: Alleluia!&quot;)
* &quot;Only-Begotten Son&quot;
* Little Litany
* Third Antiphon (often the Beatitudes with Troparia from either the Octoechos or the Canon(s) sung at Matins, unless there are Festal antiphons, in which case the refrain is the troparion of the feast)
* Small Entrance – procession with the Gospel Book
* Entrance hymn (Introit), made up of two parts:
# &quot;O come let us worship and fall down before Christ&quot;, or a Psalm verse on feasts.
# The refrain of the second antiphon, sung as &quot;who art risen from the dead&quot; on Sunday and &quot;who art wondrous in Thy saints&quot; on weekdays with no feast.
* Troparia and Kontakia
**Hymns commemorating specific saints or feasts, as appropriate to the liturgical calendar and local custom

But when the liturgy is joined to vespers (on Christmas Eve, Theophany Eve, the feast of the Annunciation (except when these days fall on Saturday or Sunday (or, in the Annunciation&#x27;s case, during Easter Week)), Maundy Thursday and Holy Saturday) after the Old Testament readings the Little Litany is said and the liturgy continues from this point:
* Trisagion, the &quot;Thrice-Holy&quot; hymn (or on certain days, another hymn):
**On Christmas, Theophany, Lazarus Saturday, Holy Saturday, Easter and Pentecost (and certain days in their Afterfeasts), we sing &quot;As many as have been baptised into Christ have put on Christ. Alleluia!&quot; (Galatians 3:26)
**On Feasts of the Cross, we sing &quot;We venerate Thy Cross, O Master, and we glorify Thy Resurrection.&quot;
* Prokeimenon
* Epistle Reading(s)
* Alleluia, with verses
* Gospel Reading(s)
** A sermon may be given here.
* Litany of Fervent Supplication – &quot;Let us all say with our whole soul and with our whole mind…&quot;
* Litany for the Departed – this is not said on Sundays, Great Feasts or during the Paschal season
* Litany of the Catechumens and Dismissal of the Catechumens

====Liturgy of the Faithful====

In the early Church, only baptized members who could receive Holy Communion were allowed to attend this portion of the Liturgy. In common contemporary practice, with very few local exceptions (e.g., Mount Athos), all may stay. However, in some places, catechumens are formally dismissed for further study.

* First Litany of the Faithful
* Second Litany of the Faithful
* Cherubikon chanted as spiritual representatives (or icons) of the angels
** Replaced on Maundy Thursday with &quot;Of Thy Mystical Supper...&quot;
** Replaced on Holy Saturday with &quot;Let all mortal flesh keep silence...&quot;
* Great Entrance – procession taking the chalice and diskos (paten) from the Table of Oblation to the altar
* Litany of Completion – &quot;Let us complete our prayer to the Lord&quot;
* The Kiss of Peace
* Symbol of Faith (the Nicene Creed)
* Anaphora (Eucharistic Prayer)
** Exclamation by the deacon: &quot;Let us stand upright...&quot;
** Blessing by the priest and Sursum Corda (&quot;Let us lift up our hearts...&quot; (Greek: &quot;Ἄνω σχῶμεν τὰς καρδίας&quot;)
**The &quot;Epinikios Hymnos&quot; or Sanctus (&quot;Holy, Holy, Holy…&quot;)
** The Eucharistic Canon, containing the Anamnesis (memorial of Christ&#x27;s Incarnation, death, and Resurrection, and the Words of Institution)
** Epiklesis, the calling down of the Holy Spirit upon the Holy Gifts (bread and wine) to change them into the Body and Blood of Christ
** Commemoration of Saints, interrupted by
*** The Theotokion (hymn to the Theotokos), usually It is Truly Meet ([Ἄξιόν ἐστιν) unless it is the Liturgy of St. Basil, when &quot;All of creation rejoices in thee...&quot; is sung, or a feast, Maundy Thursday or Holy Saturday, when the Irmos of Ode IX from the Canon at Matins is sung.
** Commemoration the dead in general, and of the living, concluding with of bishop and civil authorities – &quot;Remember, O Lord…&quot;
* Litany of Supplication – &quot;Having called to remembrance all the saints…&quot;
* Lord&#x27;s Prayer
* Bowing of Heads
* &quot;Holy Things are for the Holy&quot;
* Communion Hymn, during which:
** Cutting the Lamb for the consumption by the clergy
** Communion of the priests and deacons
** Cutting the Lamb and putting the pieces into the chalice for the consumption by the congregation
* Holy Communion of the faithful
* &quot;We have seen the true light&quot; (occasionally replaced with the troparion of the feast)
* &quot;Let our mouths be filled with Thy praise, O Lord…&quot; (occasionally replaced with the troparion of the feast)

Almost all texts are chanted throughout the Divine Liturgy, not only hymns but litanies, prayers, creed confession and even readings from the Bible, depending on tradition.
In ancient rubrics, and contemporary Greek practice, the sermon, Nicene Creed and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer are spoken/read, rather than chanted. Slavic traditions chant or sing everything except the sermon.

== Oriental Orthodox Churches ==

&quot;Divine Liturgy&quot; is the normal word for church service in Oriental Orthodoxy. In their own languages, followers of the Byzantine Rite apply it to their Eucharistic services but, while in English the same word (as also the word &quot;Mass&quot;) is at times used to speak of the corresponding services of the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the normal names used in those Churches refers either to the aspect of offering/sacrifice (&quot;Qurobo Alohoyo&quot; in the Syriac Orthodox Church), &quot;Badarak&quot; in the Armenian Apostolic Church, &quot;Prosfora&quot; in the Coptic Orthodox Church) or of sanctifying (&quot;Keddase&quot; in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church).

The Oriental Orthodox Churches own a richness of different liturgies, which are named after the anaphora included.

===Coptic Liturgy===

At present, the Coptic Orthodox Church and Coptic Catholic Church have three Liturgies:

* The Liturgy of St. Basil (4th century)
* The Liturgy of St. Mark the Apostle, this liturgy is also known as the Liturgy of St. Cyril
* The Liturgy of St Gregory the Theologian

The Liturgy of St. Basil is celebrated on most Sundays and contains the shortest anaphora. The Liturgy of St. Gregory is usually used during the feasts of the Church but not exclusively. In addition the clergy performing the liturgy can combine extracts of the Liturgies of St. Cyril and St. Gregory to the more frequently used St. Basil at the discretion of the priest or bishop.

The main liturgy used by the Coptic Church is known as Liturgy of Saint Basil. The term &quot;Liturgies of Saint Basil&quot; in a Coptic context means not only the sole anaphora with or without the related prayers, but also the general order of the Alexandrine Rite liturgy.

====Anaphora====
The Egyptian (or Coptic) anaphora of Saint Basil, even if related and using the same Antiochene (or &quot;West Syrian&quot;) structure, represents a different group from the Byzantine, West Syrian and Armenian grouping of anaphoras of Saint Basil. The Egyptian version does not derive directly from the latter and has its own peculiarities: its text is more brief, with less Scriptural and allusive enhancements, and it lacks well-defined Trinitarian references, which are typical of other versions and reflect the theology of the First Council of Constantinople of 381.

The structure of the Bohairic Coptic version used today in the Coptic Church can be summarized as follows:
*Anaphora:
**the Opening Dialogue
**the Preface, praising Father as Lord and everlasting king, as creator of heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them, and as Father of Christ by whom all things were made
**the &quot;Pre-Sanctus&quot;, praising the Father on his throne of glory and worshiped by the Angelic hosts, so introducing
**the Sanctus, conducted without the &quot;Benedictus&quot;
**the &quot;Post-Sanctus&quot;, recalling the whole history of Salvation, from the Original Sin to the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection of Christ up to the Last Judgment
**the Institution narrative
**the Anamnesis, referring to the Passion, Resurrection and Second Coming of Christ
**the Oblation, offering to the Father the Eucharistic gifts
**the Epiclesis, asking the Holy Spirit to come and to sanctify and manifest the gifts as the Most Holy; then asking the Holy Spirit to make the bread the Body and the chalice the Blood of Christ
**the Intercessions, praying for the participants to become one single body, for the Church, for the Pope of Alexandria and for all the ecclesiastic hierarchy, for the town and the harvest, for the floodings, for the living, for who have offered the Eucharistic gifts, for the saints – naming Mary, John the Baptist, Saint Stephen, Saint Mark and Saint Basil; then reading of the diptychs, followed by the prayers for the dead
**a prayer for the fruit of the Communion and the final doxology.

The 7th-century Sahidic Coptic version found in 1960 shows an earlier and more sober form of the Bohairic text: the manuscript, incomplete in its first part, begins with the &quot;Post Sanctus&quot;, and is followed by a terse &quot;Institution narrative&quot;, by a pithy &quot;Anamnesis&quot; which simply lists the themes and ends with the &quot;oblation&quot;. The next &quot;Epiclesis&quot; consists only of the prayer to the Holy Spirit to come and manifest the gifts, without any explicit request to change the gifts in the Body and Blood of Christ. The intercessions are shorter and only Mary is named among the saints.

====Liturgy of Saint Basil====
The term &quot;Liturgy of Saint Basil&quot; may refer also to the whole Eucharistic Liturgy which in the Coptic Church has the following structure:

=====Offertory=====
Offertory (or Prothesis) is the part of the liturgy in which the Sacramental bread (&quot;qorban&quot;) and wine (&quot;abarkah&quot;) are chosen and placed on the altar. All these rites are Middle-ages developments.

It begins with the dressing of the priest with vestments and the preparation of the altar, along with prayers of worthiness for the celebrant. At this point is chanted the appropriate hour of the Canonical hours, followed by the washing of the hands with its prayer of worthiness, and by the proclamation of the Nicean Creed.

Then takes place the elaborate rite of the choosing of the Lamb: while the congregation sing 41 times the Kyrie eleison, the priest checks the wine and chooses among the bread one loaf which will be consecrated (the &quot;Lamb&quot;). The Lamb is cleaned with a napkin and blessed with the priest&#x27;s thumb wet with wine. Afterwards the priest takes the Lamb in procession around the altar and the deacon follows with the wine and a candle. At the altar, the priest, with appropriate prayers, blesses the Lamb and the wine, places the Lamb on the Paten and pours wine and a few drops of water in the chalice (the chalice is placed on the altar in a wooden box named &quot;ark&quot;).

The last part of the offertory resembles an anaphora: after a dialogue, the priest blesses the congregation and proclaims a prayer of thanksgiving, giving thanks to God for his support to us, and asking him for a worthy participation to the liturgy. Then comes the prayer of covering said inaudibly by the priest, which has the form of an epiclesis asking God to show his face on the gifts, and to change them in order that the bread and wine may became the Body and Blood of Christ. This text might come from an ancient anaphora or simply be a later High Middle Ages creation. The paten and the ark with the chalice inside are here covered with a veil.

=====Liturgy of the Catechumens=====
In the Liturgy of the Catechumens the readings from the New Testament are proclaimed. This portion was in ancient times the beginning of the liturgy, and the only part which could be attended by the catechumens. It is roughly equivalent to the &quot;Liturgy of the Word&quot; in the Western Rites.

It begins with a Penitential Rite in which first the priest prays inaudibly to Christ for the forgiveness of sins (&quot;The Absolution to the Son&quot;) and then all the participants kneel in front of the altar and the celebrant, or the bishop if present, recites a prayer of absolution (&quot;The Absolution to the Ministers&quot;).

The reading from the Pauline epistles is preceded by the offering of incense at the four sides of the altar, at the iconostasis, at the book of the Gospel and at the faithfuls in the nave; in the meantime the faithful sing a hymn to Mary and a hymn of intercession. The Pauline epistle is followed by a reading from the Catholic epistles and by one from the Acts of the Apostles. Another offering of incense is conduced (the &quot;Praxis Incense&quot;), similar to the Pauline incense except that only the first row of the faithful is incensed. A reading from the Coptic Synaxarium can follow.

After these readings, the Trisagion is sung three times, each time with a different reference to the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, thus addressing the Trisagion to Christ only. After the Trisagion follows a litany, the recital of a Psalm and the singing of the Alleluia, and finally the proclamation of the Gospel from the doors of the sanctuary. The sermon may follow.

=====Liturgy of the Faithful=====
The Liturgy of the Faithful is the core of the Liturgy, where are placed the proper Eucharistic rites.

It begins with the prayer of the Veil, in which the priest offers the liturgical sacrifice to God. The Long Litanies follows, where all pray for the peace, for the ecclesiastic hierarchy and for the congregation. The Nicean Creed is proclaimed, the priest washes his hands three times and sprinkles water on the congregation reciting the Prayer of Reconciliation which is a prayer of worthiness for all who attend the liturgy. Next is the Kiss of peace during which the faithful sing the &quot;Aspasmos Adam&quot; (&quot;Rejoice O Mary&quot;) hymn.

The Anaphora is conducted. After the anaphora takes place the consignation, i.e. the moistening of the Lamb with some drops of the consecrated Wine, which is shown for the worship of the faithful. The Fraction of the consecrated Lamb ensues, during which the priest says a prayer which varies according to the Coptic calendar. All of the congregation stands and prays with open hands the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

To be prepared for partaking of the Eucharist, the faithful bow while the celebrant says in low voice the prayer of submission, then the priest and the participants offer each other a wish of peace and the priest inaudibly prays to the Father for the forgiveness of sins (&quot;The Absolution to the Father&quot;).

The Elevation is similar to that in the Byzantine Rite, with the celebrant who raises the portion of the Lamb engraved with a cross (the &quot;ispadikon&quot;) crying: &quot;The holy things for the holy ones&quot;. The priest makes a second consignation and puts gently the ispakidon in the chalice (the commixture), then he recites aloud a confession of faith. The partaking of the Eucharist follows, first the Body of Christ given to the celebrants, to the deacons and to the faithful who approach the sanctuary without shoes and then the Blood of Christ in the same order. Psalm 150 is sung in the meantime. The distribution of the Eucharist ends with a blessing with the Paten.

The dismissal rites include The Prayer of Laying the Hands and the final blessing.

===Syro-Antiochene liturgy===

The Syriac Orthodox Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, the Syriac Maronite Church of Antioch and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church of the West Syriac Rite which is developed from the Antiochene Rite use a version of the Divine Liturgy of Saint James which differs substantially from its Byzantine Rite counterpart, most notably in being substantially shorter (it can be completed in under two hours, whereas the historic form of the Byzantine Rite liturgy prior to the revisions of St. Basil and St. John Chrysostom took more than four hours), and in that it can be used with more than eighty different anaphoras; the most commonly used are those of Mar Bar Salibi (which is the shortest), and that of St. James, which resembles that of the Byzantine Rite liturgy, and is mandated on certain occasions, such as major feasts, the consecration of churches, and the first liturgies offered by newly ordained priests. Due to the long isolation of the Saint Thomas Christians the rite of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church shows some differences, so that this rite is called the Malankara Rite.

===Armenian Liturgy===
The Armenian Apostolic Church and the Armenian Catholic Church have at present a single liturgical structure, called the Armenian Rite, with a single anaphora (the Athanasius-Anaphora) for the liturgy: Holy Patarag or in Western Armenian Holy Badarak, meaning &#x27;sacrifice&#x27;. This is in distinction from the other liturgies of the Oriental Orthodox Churches (Coptic, West Syrian, Ethiopic) which have retained multiple anaphora.

This means that the text of the Patarag can be contained in a single, unified liturgical book, the Պատարագամատոյց (&quot;Pataragamatooyts&quot;, Western Armenian &quot;Badarakamadooyts&quot;, meaning &#x27;the offering of sacrifice&#x27;). This book contains all of the prayers for the Patarag assigned to the bishop (if celebrating as a bishop), the celebrating priest, the deacon(s), and the people, the last typically led by a choir with accompaniment.

Before the end of the 10th century there were also other liturgical forms, such as the Anaphora of St. Basil, the Anaphora of St. Gregory the Illuminator and others in use.

The elements of the Armenian eucharistic liturgy reflect the rich set of influences on Armenian culture. The roots of the liturgy lie in the West Syrian and Byzantine forms, with the influence of the Roman Catholic Mass, the latter having arrived likely during the period of the Fourth Crusade or shortly thereafter.

Among the distinctive practices of the Armenian Patarag is the tradition that on the Sundays of the fast before Easter (the Great Fast) the curtain which hangs down in front of the elevated altar area (Armenian խորան &quot;khoran&quot;) is never opened – even for the reading of the Gospel, certain movable parts of the liturgy are omitted, the parts of the liturgy sung by the choir are said or chanted simply without adornment, there is no general confession, and there is no distribution of Communion to the faithful. This practice of fasting from the Communion bread in preparation for Easter may reflect an ancient custom of the church in Jerusalem. A special prayer of repentance is sung by the clergy on the morning of Palm Sunday (Armenian: Ծաղկազարդ &quot;tsaghkazard&quot;, Western Armenian &quot;dzaghgazard&quot;), after which the curtain is opened for the first time since the last Sunday before the Great Fast.

One element which almost certainly derives from the influence of Western liturgy is the reading of a last Gospel at the conclusion of the Patarag. However, the celebration of a short memorial service for one or more departed persons (Հոգեհանգիստ &quot;hogehangist&quot;, Western Armenian &quot;hokehankist&quot;, meaning &#x27;rest of the spirit&#x27;) is quite prevalent in parishes and replaces the reading of the last Gospel.

====Holy Qurbana====

Holy Qurbana is the Eucharistic celebration in the Edessan Rite. The Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East and their larger Catholic counterparts, the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syro-Malabar Church, which use the Edessan Rite that they all inherit from the Church of the East, employ one or more of three different Eucharistic anaphorae when celebrating Holy Qurbana:

* Anaphora of Addai and Mari (or The Hallowing of the Apostles, i.e., of the Apostles Saint Addai and Saint Mari)
* The Hallowing of Theodore of Mopsuestia, attributed to Theodore of Mopsuestia
* The Hallowing of Nestorius, attributed to Nestorius

<text>The Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, Inc., or LASFS, is a science fiction and fantasy fan society that meets in the Los Angeles area. The current meeting place can be found on the LASFS website.

LASFS is the oldest continuously operating science fiction club in the world, helped considerably in maintaining that record by being one of the few to have owned a clubhouse. The organization continues to hold regular weekly meetings on Thursdays. The club maintains a private lending library of books, videos, and other genre-related materials, for use by members.

Members of the club have run the World Science Fiction Convention several times, initiated the regional science-fiction convention Westercon, and hosts a yearly science fiction convention called Loscon. It maintains a web site and discussion forum, publishes (at irregular intervals) an amateur magazine called &quot;Shangri L&#x27;Affaires&quot;, and hosts the collations of a weekly amateur press association, APA-L. The LASFS monthly newsletter, &quot;De Profundis&quot;, is named for the club motto, &quot;De Profundis ad Astra&quot; (&quot;From the Depths to the Stars&quot;) and is available (in PDF format) for reading at the LASFS website, or can be obtained by writing its editor/publisher, Marty Cantor.

== History ==
In 1934 Hugo Gernsback, editor of the then-prominent science fiction magazine &quot;Wonder Stories&quot;, established a correspondence club for fans called the &quot;Science Fiction League.&quot; Local groups across the nation could join by filling out an application. Early meetings were held first at the Pacific Electric Building, then moved to Clifton&#x27;s Cafeteria. Forrest J Ackerman later wrote, &quot;The first meetings of the club were held in what was called the Pacific Electric Building in downtown Los Angeles. I think that once a month, a man who worked there was able to get the seventh or eighth floor free for us. Then we moved to Clifton&#x27;s Cafeteria, a feature of which was their free limeade and lime juice. Some of the members who didn&#x27;t have more than a nickel or dime to spend guzzled a lot of that free juice.

By 1936, the League had begun to fail. New management was less interested in the League, and the members grew up and lost interest. Charter group number four, in Los Angeles, had an active member in Forrest J. Ackerman, who missed the first few meetings (he was living in San Francisco with his parents), but whose enthusiasm and imagination provided a focus for the group. &quot;Forry&quot; and a cadre of other members kept it alive as the science fiction and fantasy genres developed. Local authors (and sometimes those from out of the area) also helped by coming to meetings from time to time.

In 1939, the group broke with the Science Fiction League, changed its name to the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, and begun to meet every Thursday. In this decade, the club began publishing the fanzine &quot;Shangri L&#x27;Affaires&quot;. Nicknamed &quot;Shaggy&quot;, the zine has died and been revived many times over the decades. When published now, it is photocopied, but originally it was done on a mimeograph machine. One of the ways to earn your dues was to crank the machine and collate the sheets.

World War II was a very busy time for the club, though few major changes were made. Most members were either below or well above draft age, and many fans from around the country visited en route to the war in the Pacific. Some moved to Los Angeles to work in defense industries.

In the 1940s, some members such as Ray Bradbury began writing professionally, and an increasing number of professional science fiction authors visited meetings or joined as &quot;Members at Large&quot; elsewhere in the world. For some years, the club sponsored &quot;Fanquets&quot; for members who had made their first professional sale.

In the 1950s, the club became embroiled in controversy, partly from taking the stand that if they didn&#x27;t address controversies, they would fade away. Ackerman was still the mainstay of the club in the first part of the 1950s, but marriage and work needs led to his attending less frequently. One of the live wires of the club at this time was Bjo Trimble, a former WAVE who met her husband John under Ackerman&#x27;s piano (at a crowded party).

In the 1960s the club continued to grow, with the effects of the counterculture of the 1960s adding new members from the surrounding suburbs of Southern California. Many members became fans of the newly created &quot;Star Trek&quot; television show, and in 1968 Trimble and other members of LASFS were instrumental in organizing a nationwide letter writing campaign which saved the show from its announced cancellation by NBC at the end of its second season.


The club&#x27;s meeting place (called &#x27;Freehafer Hall&#x27; by the members after member Paul Freehafer) was usually in a public meeting hall and so it would be forced to relocate from time to time. Over the decades it moved from central Los Angeles further west until it reached Santa Monica, &quot;as far west as it could go and remain dry.&quot;

In 1964, member Paul Turner made what seemed to some like a frivolous suggestion, to others a brilliant idea: that the LASFS establish a building fund, generated from weekly meeting dues and fund-raising events such as auctions, with the idea of eventually purchasing its own permanent clubhouse. Members quickly began taking the idea seriously, and by the late 1960s, after a period of hesitation, Bruce Pelz became the building fund&#x27;s most fervent supporter.

In 1973, less than 10 years after its inception, the LASFS building fund had enough money in the bank to purchase a small private residence on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City and convert it into the weekly meeting hall. By 1977, the club needed a newer, larger clubhouse, and so it sold the Ventura Boulevard property and purchased a property at 11513 Burbank Boulevard, about two blocks west of Lankershim Blvd in North Hollywood, with two buildings: Freehafer Hall (the rear building), and &quot;Building 4SJ&quot; (fronting the Street). Building 4SJ was named after Forrest J Ackerman, and contained the society&#x27;s lending library, furnished rooms for socializing, and a pay telephone.

On September 1, 2011, the organization moved to a new building in Van Nuys, which formerly housed a cabinet-making shop and a poker school.

As of early 2018, while a more permanent location is being sought, the meetings are being held in a temporary location: Null Space Labs, 10717 Chandler Blvd. (rear), North Hollywood 91601, from 6:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

The club met at the American Lutheran Church, 755 North Whitnall Highway, Burbank, CA 91505 from August 2, 2018 until in-person meetings became inadvisable due to COVID-19. LASFS meetings are now held via Zoom. See LASFS website for current meeting information.

== Officers ==
The Treasurer is elected once a year; the other club officers are elected twice a year. The Board of Directors is elected on a staggered basis: 4, 4, and 3.

For the current list of officers and directors, please see the Contact LASFS page.

== Cultural references ==
In the Hugo-nominated science fiction novel &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; by LASFS members Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (with Michael Flynn), LASFS&#x27; unofficial motto &quot;Death Will Not Release You&quot; and its even more unofficial countersign &quot;... even if you die&quot; play a pivotal role in plot development. The protagonist of Keith Laumer&#x27;s 1968 novella &quot;The Day Before Forever&quot; describes the fashion styles in a future society as &quot;like something from Westercon II&quot;.

<doc id="191639" wikidata="Q1122799" url="?curid=191639" title="Comstock Act of 1873">
<text>The Comstock Act of 1873 is a series of current provisions in Federal law that generally criminalize the involvement of the United States Postal Service, its officers, or a common carrier in conveying obscene matter, crime-inciting matter, or certain abortion-related matter. The Comstock Act is largely codified across title 18 of the United States Code and was enacted beginning in 1872 with the attachment of a rider to the Post Office Consolidation Act of 1872. Amended multiple times since initial enactment, most recently in 1996, the Act is nonetheless often associated with U.S. Postal Inspector and anti-vice activist Anthony Comstock.

The law was applied broadly for much of its history, before the scope of enforcement narrowed after various court rulings, and modern enforcement is primarily focused on prosecuting child pornography (with the most recent conviction under the Act being made in 2021). In spite of its contentious nature, something that has throughout the years spawned a variety of legal challenges on enumerated powers doctrine, vagueness doctrine, First Amendment grounds, and so forth, the Comstock Act has thus far been widely upheld as constitutional.

== Text ==
=== Preface ===
The majority of the Comstock Act is found in sections 1461 and 1462 of chapter 71, title 18 of the United States Code. The rest of chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, consists of various provisions from the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 and the PROTECT Act of 2003.

=== 18 U.S.C. § 1461 ===
The first of the two sections of the Comstock Act which are contained under chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, is section 1461. This is the initial Comstock Act provision, as currently amended, and it was first enacted as a rider under Sec. 148 of the Post Office Consolidation Act of 1872. The punishment for violating section 1461 is either a fine, a jail sentence of up to 5 years for a first offense, a jail sentence of up to 10 years for any subsequent offense, or a combination of a jail sentence and a fine, as is stated in its text.

There exists two elements to an offense under section 1461. First, it must relate to that described; chiefly, either obscene or pertaining to abortion. Second, a person must &quot;knowingly&quot; mail, cause to be mailed, or remove from the mail, anything specified. The following is a brief summary of the matters covered:

# An &quot;obscene article.&quot;
# An &quot;article&quot; &quot;designed, adapted, or intended&quot; for obscene or &quot;abortion-causing&quot; purposes.
# An &quot;article&quot; &quot;advertised or otherwise described in a manner calculated to lead to its application&quot; for obscene or &quot;abortion-causing&quot; purposes.
# &quot;Mail matter&quot; giving information as to &quot;who, what, where, or how&quot; an &quot;article&quot; (either designed, adapted, intended for use or described in a manner to calculated to incite its use for obscene or &quot;abortion-causing&quot; purposes) may be &quot;obtained or made.&quot;
# &quot;Mail matter&quot; giving information as to &quot;from who, where, how, or by what means an act or operation&quot; for abortion may be &quot;procured or produced&quot;.
# &quot;Mail matter&quot; &quot;advertising or representing&quot; as to &quot;whether or by what means&quot; an &quot;article&quot; may be &quot;applied&quot; for obscene or &quot;abortion-causing&quot; purposes.
# &quot;Mail matter calculated to incite&quot; use of an &quot;article&quot; for obscene or &quot;abortion-causing&quot; purposes.
There are a number of implications with these specifics listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1461.

First, as summarized in points 1, 2, and 3 above, this section outright criminalizes activities related to the mailing of three categories of objects and to this extent has been upheld as constitutionally valid by the Supreme Court.

Second, as summarized in point 4 above, this section criminalizes activities related to the mailing of information providing as to from who, where, what, or how an article, already criminalized from being mailed outright, may be obtained or made. Although it holds little precedential value, as it was a decision by a United States district court, this provision was ruled unconstitutional (for being overbroad) in &quot;United States v. Goldstein&quot; (1976).

Third, laws prohibiting conveyance of material providing information on the procurement of &quot;legal&quot; abortion were ruled unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds in &quot;Bigelow v. Virginia&quot; (1975). As far as &quot;illegal&quot; abortion procurement is concerned, that is criminal solicitation and the First Amendment affords no constitutional protection.

=== 18 U.S.C. § 1462 ===
The second of the three primary sections of the Comstock Act is codified in a positive law title at section 1462 of chapter 71, title 18, United States Code. It was initially enacted under Sec. 211 of the Criminal Code Act of 1909 on March 4, 1909.

The punishment for a violation of section 1462 is identical to that provided for violating section 1461. Similarly there exists two elements to an offense under this section. First, the matter in question has to be of the nature described. Second, a person must &quot;knowingly&quot; commit any of the specified acts (which in this section is either import, carriage in interstate or foreign commerce, or receipt of the specified material) and implicate in connection either the U.S. mail, a common carrier, or an interactive computer service.

In terms of differences to the previous section, section 1462 deviates in that its scope expands to cover the use of a common carrier or interactive computer service. Section 1461 only applies to the U.S. Mail, but section 1462 covers both that and a private package delivery service such as United Parcel Service or Federal Express. An interactive computer service generally includes an internet website. Another difference of 18 U.S.C. § 1462 is in its scope, which is more limited than 18 U.S.C. § 1461, as it describes three as opposed to the seven particular matters. The three matters specified in 18 U.S.C. § 1462 are:

# An obscene &quot;article&quot; (to include the additions of &#x27;a thing capable of producing sound&#x27; or a &#x27;motion picture film&#x27;).
# An article designed, adapted, or intended for obscene or abortion-causing purposes.
# Mail matter giving information as to who, what, where, or how an article (either designed, adapted, intended for use or described in a manner calculated to incite to its use for obscene or abortion-causing purposes) may be obtained or made&quot;.&quot;

=== 18 U.S.C. § 552 ===
There is one section of the Comstock Act found in title 18, United States Code, which is outside chapter 71. This is 18 U.S.C. § 552,and pertains to customs officials acting as principal to certain activity. For abortion-related matter, this section applies to the extent implicating procurement of abortion. This section, currently codified in a positive law title, was first enacted as Sec. 4. of an Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use.

There are four elements to an offense under this section. First, one must be either an &quot;officer, employee, or agent&quot; of the United States. Second, one must &quot;knowingly&quot; aid or abet any of the specified offenses (importing, advertising, dealing, exhibiting, sending, or receiving). Third, the knowing aiding or abetting by an officer, employee, or agent of the United States must implicate use of the mail. Fourth, the offense must implicate any of the matters specified. These are summarized below:

# Obscene articles.
# Articles advocating or urging treason, insurrection, or forcible resistance against the United States.
# Mail matter containing true threats of physical harm to or taking the life of any person in the United States.
# Articles containing means for procuring abortion, for which surrounding case law has limited to the unlawful procuring of abortion.

=== Sec. 305. of the Tariff Act of 1930 (or 19 U.S.C. § 1305) ===
In addition to the criminal importation provisions under section 1462, there is also a civil forfeiture provision of the Comstock Act. While an earlier version did exist, as Sec. 5. of the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use, the modern version was initially enacted under Sec. 305. of the Tariff Act of 1930 and is currently codified (in a non-positive law title) at section 1305 of title 19, United States Code. It presently provides that:

This provision has two basic aspects. First and foremost, it subjects certain matters to civil forfeiture. Secondly, it provides a number of exceptions. These exceptions are items imported without the importer&#x27;s knowledge, bulk abortion-related materials not intended for unlawful use, classic books of recognized merit when permitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, and lottery tickets printed in Canada after 1993 for use in lotteries within the United States.

=== 39 U.S.C. § 3001(e) ===
The last section of the Comstock Act is found at 39 U.S.C. § 3001 in subsection (e), and it declares that unsolicited contraceptives are non-mailable unless the addressee is a manufacturer or trader in contraceptives, a physician, a nurse, a pharmacist, a hospital, or a clinic. This provision was ruled unconstitutional in &quot;Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp&quot; (1983), as-applied to business mailings, due to an as-applied First Amendment challenge.

==Definitions, knowledge requirement, statute of limitations, etc.==

=== Definitions ===
Concerning the definitions used in the Comstock Act, there are three key definitions: &quot;indecent,&quot; &quot;obscene&quot;, and &quot;knowingly&quot;.

For purposes of the Comstock Act, the term indecent is defined in the text as including &quot;matter of a character tending to incite arson, murder, or assassination&quot;. This distinct definition has been narrowed by court rulings to a synonym for obscene.

The term obscene is not defined in the actual text of Comstock Act, nor is it defined in the text for much of any of U.S. obscenity law, but the Miller test provides the most current definition used by courts when judging obscenity. The Miller Test has three prongs which are as follows:

# The average person applying contemporary community standards would find the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;
# the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law; and
# the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.

=== Knowledge requirement ===
For reference, under the Model Penal Code, a guide often used to assist in legislative drafting, the &quot;knowingly&quot; criminal knowledge requirement, the second most stringent behind &quot;purposely&quot;, is defined as follows: &quot;A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when...he is aware that his conduct is of that nature...if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.&quot;

=== Statute of limitations ===
As nothing indicates otherwise, and since a violation of the Act is a non-capital offense, it has a 5-year statute of limitations.

==Jurisprudence==
=== Contemporary ===
==== Context ====
In June 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down a 5–4 majority opinion in the case of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022). This decision devolved regulation of abortion back to the states, overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) along with its progeny, and ended the recognition of abortion access as an implied constitutional right. Consequently, the applicability of the Comstock Act to abortion-related articles has become subject to legal dispute.

Much of this dispute has arisen concerning mifepristone, an antiprogestogen and antiglucocorticoid drug. Mifepristone is approved (under the brand name Mifeprex), in a regimen with misoprostol (a prostaglandin analogue), for ending of a pregnancy up to 70 days post gestation. Mifepristone is additionally approved on its own (under the brand name Korlym) as a treatment for Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Mifepristone is sometimes used, albeit off-label in the United States, for treating fibroids, treating endometriosis, treating miscarriage, or inducing labor.

==== &quot;FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine&quot; (2024) ====
In March 2023, the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, an anti-abortion group founded in 2022, filed a federal lawsuit challenging the FDA&#x27;s approval of mifepristone from back in the year 2000. On April 7, 2023, Matthew Kacsmaryk, a district judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, ruled at the trial-level in that case, &quot;Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration,&quot; that the approval of mifepristone was improper, the lifting of REMS restrictions was improper, and the Comstock Act of 1873 made providing medication abortion by mail illegal. This ruling by judge Kacsmaryk conflicted with an opposing same day ruling issued by a U.S. district court in Washington (state).

Upon appeal (six days later) to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, some of the ruling by judge Kacsmaryk was partially stayed and some of the claims presented were thrown out, although a sizable portion of Kacsmaryk&#x27;s ruling emerged unscathed. The case was later appealed from the Fifth Circuit to the Supreme Court.

On June 13, 2024, the Supreme Court unanimously held that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine did not have standing (no plaintiff suffered a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact) sufficient to bring the case, and thereby the Supreme Court avoided a direct ruling on whether the Comstock Act applies to mifepristone or whether mifepristone was properly approved.

===Historical===

==== Congressional authority to enact the Comstock Act ====
&quot;Ex parte Jackson&quot; (1878) was the first case brought before the Supreme Court of the United States that considered the constitutionality of the Comstock Act. While primarily pertaining to a facial challenge mounted against a federal law barring the mailing of lottery items, the Court nonetheless made reference to the Comstock Act. In doing, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed both the lottery circular law and the original provision of the Comstock Act (18 U.S.C. § 1461) as being valid exercises of Congressional authority under the Postal Clause. This holding concerning the Comstock Act&#x27;s initial provision was reaffirmed in later cases like &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; (1957), &quot;United States v. Reidel&quot; (1971), and &quot;Smith v. United States&quot; (1977).

The 1909 amendment to the Comstock Act (18 U.S.C. § 1462) applies to both the U.S. mail and a common carrier and has been upheld on Commerce Clause grounds, as opposed to Postal Clause grounds, with &quot;United States v. Orito&quot; (1973) illustrating this. In a separate 1973 case, the Supreme Court would similarly uphold Sec. 305. of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. § 1305) as a valid exercise of authority under the Commerce Clause.

==== Vagueness challenges ====
The broad language used in the Comstock Act has, mostly in the years since the &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision, lead to some opining that the Comstock Act, particularly 18 U.S.C. § 1461, is unconstitutionally vague. However, the understanding built by the surrounding case law has been largely dismissive of vagueness challenges. For instance, in &quot;Hamling v. United States&quot; (1974), the Supreme Court would uphold section 1461 by adopting a saving construction that conformed the section with the Miller test. Later, in &quot;Smith v. United States&quot; (1977), the Supreme Court would push back against another vagueness argument (this time presented as an as-applied challenge). Writing for the court, Justice Harry Blackmun, best known for writing the opinion delivered in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973), would go on to explicitly state the following:

&quot;United States v. 12 200-ft Reels of Film&quot; (1973) and &quot;United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs&quot; (1971) adopted a similar line of interpretation towards 18 U.S.C. § 1462 and Sec. 305. of the Tariff Act of 1930 (or 19 U.S.C. § 1305) respectively. The opinion in &quot;Thirty-Seven Photographs&quot; was handed down two years prior to &quot;Miller v. California&quot; (1973) and additionally interpreted a 14-day time limit into beginning forfeitures under Sec. 305 of the Tariff Act of 1930.

==== Obscenity statutory interpretation ====
While the standards for what constitutes obscenity have changed since the Comstock Act&#x27;s initial passage, the Act&#x27;s application to obscenity has been upheld against an array of First Amendment challenges. As an example, in &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; (1957), a case partially superseded by &quot;Miller v. California&quot; (1973) as to the particular test used, the Supreme Court upheld the Comstock Act against a First Amendment challenge. In &quot;One, Inc. v. Olesen&quot; (1958), decided as a follow-on to &quot;Roth&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that material pertaining to homosexuality is not &quot;ipso facto&quot; obscene and later reaffirming the conclusion in &quot;MANual Enterprises v. Day&quot; (1962). The &quot;Miller&quot; test is the obscenity test currently applied to the Comstock Act, as explained in the opinion for &quot;Hamling v. United States&quot; (1974).

==== Statutory interpretation of abortion-related references ====
With respect to the Comstock Act&#x27;s references to abortion, which currently have not been removed as had the reference to contraceptives, historical interpretation has generally construed this as applying to articles intended for unlawful abortion, reconciling it with Sec. 305. of the Tariff Act of 1930, which does make such a distinction.

Moreover, as the Supreme Court held, in &quot;Linder v. United States&quot; (1925), that &quot;[o]bviously, direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government&quot;, historical jurisprudence of the Comstock Act in regard to prosecuting delivery of drugs and devices hinged on determining whether a purported use, such as for abortion or contraception, was outside the scope of accepted professional practice in the state of delivery or receipt, and thereby punishable under the Comstock Act.

==== Status as a RICO predicate ====
An area of interest to legal scholars concerned the effect of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 which, among other things, added &quot;dealing in obscene matters&quot; as a predicate offense for purposes of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970 (RICO). It was initially believed by some scholars that this modification to RICO would get struck down as an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment protected conduct. Nine years after that modification was made to RICO, this concern would be answered as the Supreme Court, in &quot;Alexander v. United States&quot; (1993), upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, a RICO forfeiture pertaining to obscenity.

==== Contraceptives ====
Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was charged in 1915 for her work &quot;The Woman Rebel&quot;. Sanger circulated this work through the U.S. postal service, violating the Comstock Act. On appeal, her conviction was reversed on the grounds that contraceptive devices could legally be promoted for the cure and prevention of disease. Her husband, architect William Sanger, was similarly charged earlier that year under a New York law against disseminating contraceptive information. In 1932, Margaret Sanger arranged for a shipment of diaphragms to be mailed from Japan to a sympathetic physician in New York City. When U.S. customs confiscated the package as unlawful contraceptives, Sanger aided that physician in filing a lawsuit to contest the seizure.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in the case, &quot;United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries&quot; (1936), that the Comstock Act was not to be construed as interfering with practice of medicine. This holding was in line with the previously mentioned conclusion of the Supreme Court in &quot;Linder&quot; that &quot;[o]bviously, direct control of medical practice in the states is beyond the power of the federal government&quot;, so while the federal government could prohibit the mailing of contraceptives outside the course of professional practice, or tax drugs as it had with the Harrison Act at issue in &quot;Linder,&quot; it was not of the liberty to cast the judgment that a use, otherwise accepted by relevant state medical authorities, was nonetheless beyond the realm of legitimate professional practice, as regulation of medical practice is addressed at the state level in the United States.

&quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965) struck down a contraception-related Comstock-style law in Connecticut. However, &quot;Griswold&quot; only applied to marital relationships. &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; (1972) extended its holding to unmarried persons as well. In 1971, the U.S. Congress removed the reference to contraceptives from the federal-level Comstock Act, but left much the rest of the Act stand as it had been written.

== Contemporary enforcement ==
Due to its age, the Comstock Act has been referred to by some commentators, in publications such as MSNBC and &quot;Slate&quot;, as a &quot;zombie law&quot;. However, the Act remains just as effective as does any other federal law unless repealed or amended. The doctrine of desuetude (a common law concept that a law is repealed by implication if it has not been used in a long time) has not garnered widespread support in U.S. courts.

The law has had some prosecutions in recent years, though enforcement of the Act&#x27;s provisions has shifted from obscenity generally to primarily being a tool in securing child pornography convictions. The most recent conviction made under the Comstock Act, with five of the nine charges being brought forth under 18 U.S.C. § 1462, was that of Thomas Alan Arthur, a Texas man who was sentenced in 2021 to 40 years in federal prison for his role as the operator of an internet site which acted as a paid repository of obscene writings and drawings pertaining to child sexual abuse. According to FBI agent Roger Young, the Comstock Act and other federal obscenity laws were initially the only tools available for federal authorities to prosecute child pornography:

This change in enforcement, from general obscenity to an emphasis on child sexual abuse material, was bolstered by the Reagan Administration and by the outcome in &quot;New York v. Ferber&quot; (1982), a landmark decision in which the Supreme Court unanimously held that child pornography is not protected by the First Amendment. President Reagan made child sexual abuse prosecution a priority during his administration and stated in 1987, &quot;this Administration is putting the purveyors of illegal obscenity and child pornography on notice: your industry&#x27;s days are numbered.&quot;

Another anti-child-pornography and anti-obscenity law to be signed by President Reagan is the Child Protection Act of 1984 and it was the first law to generally outlaw child pornography at the federal level. Reagan-era amendments to Comstock Act do not stand alone though, as President Bill Clinton later signed into law 1994 and 1996 amendments to the Act which increased its penalties and expanded the scope of 18 U.S.C. § 1462 to cover an interactive computer service (internet website).
== Present-day discourse ==

=== Context ===
Following the outcome reached in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022), the Comstock Act has become increasingly discussed by anti-abortion groups and public figures as being a means by which abortion access in the United States could be curtailed without the need for new federal legislation.

=== Anti-abortion discourse ===
In a February 2024 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jonathan F. Mitchell, an attorney active in the anti-abortion movement and a former Solicitor General of Texas, expressed an optimistic viewpoint about the Comstock Act&#x27;s applicability to abortion: &quot;We don&#x27;t need a federal [abortion] ban when we have Comstock on the books.&quot; However, Mitchell nonetheless hoped that Donald Trump would not discuss the issue: &quot;[I hope Trump] doesn&#x27;t know about the existence of Comstock, because I just don&#x27;t want him to shoot off his mouth.&quot; Mitchell said similarly of anti-abortion activists: &quot;I think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the [2024 presidential] election.&quot; Ed Whelan, another attorney active in the anti-abortion movement and the former president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank, expressed a view similar to that of Mitchell and criticized Biden administration policy towards abortion, claiming that &quot;[b]y hook or by crook, the Biden administration is determined to undermine or circumvent state laws restricting abortion&quot;.

In January 2023, Vice President JD Vance, then a U.S. senator from Ohio, signed a letter, along with other Senate colleagues, supporting the application of the Comstock Act to abortion-related articles such as abortion pills.

The Heritage Foundation&#x27;s Project 2025, a self-styled &quot;mandate for leadership&quot; intended for use by a future conservative President of the United States, has a section on abortion access that indirectly refers to the Comstock Act as &quot;federal laws that prohibit the distribution of abortion drugs by postal mail&quot;.

On February 2, 2023, twenty Republican State attorneys general issued a letter to CVS and Walgreens against the mailing of mifepristone and misoprostol in combination, citing the Comstock Act. This letter was in response to announcements by CVS and Walgreens in January 2023 that the pharmacy chains would begin processing mifepristone-misoprostol prescriptions. In March 2023, Walgreens announced it would not distribute mifepristone-misoprostol in combination within those twenty states.

=== Abortion rights discourse ===
Proponents of a right to access abortion, such as Democratic Senator for Minnesota Tina Smith, have, since the 2022 &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision, advocated for the repealing of the Comstock Act&#x27;s language relating to abortion. On June 20, 2024, Senator Smith announced that she was going to be unveiling legislation to achieve that goal. Senator Smith&#x27;s proposed legislation is not the first time legislators in the United States have proposed or introduced legislation to repeal the Act&#x27;s abortion-related language. In 1997, Representative Barney Frank introduced the Comstock Cleanup Act in an effort to achieve this same goal, but his bill failed (not even making it to committee).

=== Implications ===
If the Supreme Court were to affirm a determination that the Comstock Act applies to abortion-related articles generally, or if a future administration began enforcing it in such a way, then the Comstock Act could have renewed significance as mifepristone and misoprostol are used in 63% of the abortions performed in the United States. This combination regimen has increasingly been prescribed through telehealth and delivered by mail to individuals within states where abortion has since been broadly restricted following the &quot;Dobbs&quot; decision.

Some other concerns raised, if this view took hold, are that not only would the use of telehealth to prescribe mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs used in combination for most medication abortion, become largely criminal but, since Comstock Act violations are a predicate offense, persons (and their associated enterprises) involved in provisioning abortion telehealth could also face penalties under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970.

== Historical background ==
=== General ===
The Comstock Act&#x27;s initial provision was enacted, June 8, 1872, as a rider under Sec. 148 of the Post Office Consolidation Act of 1872. It read:

This section was amended by an Act of Congress on March 3, 1873. The amendment made by section two of that Act criminalized any use of the U.S. Postal Service to send any of the following items: obscenity, contraceptives, abortifacients, sex toys, personal letters with any sexual content or information, or any information regarding the above items. The provisions of the Comstock Act, as currently revised, only pertain to obscene, crime-inciting, or abortion-related articles or mail matter.

In addition to the federal law about half of the states enacted laws similar to the federal Comstock Act. In a 1919 issue of the &quot;Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology&quot;, Kansas judge J. C. Ruppenthal, after reviewing the various State laws called them &quot;haphazard and capricious&quot; and lacking &quot;any clear, broad, well-defined principle or purpose&quot;.

=== Objectives and intent ===
According to psychologist Paul R. Abramson, the widespread availability of pornography during the American Civil War (1861–1865) gave rise to an anti-pornography movement, culminating in the passage of the Comstock Act in 1873, but which also dealt with birth control and abortion issues.

The historical enforcement of Comstock-style laws targeted pornography, contraceptive equipment, abortion drugs and devices, materials providing descriptions of contraceptive or abortion methods, materials advertising people with information of or providing for birth control, abortion, or other similar things. A particular concern to historical enforcers was targeting advertisements for abortifacients found in penny papers, with these pills often advertised to women as a euphemistic treatment for &quot;obstruction of their monthly periods&quot;.

=== Legislative history ===

==== Brief legislative context ====
As mentioned above, the initial provision of the Comstock Act was enacted in 1872 as a rider to a broader postal service consolidation bill. Afterwards, Anthony Comstock worked to introduce a stand-alone bill, the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use, with more comprehensive provisions.

==== Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use ====
Due to his personal connections with Justice William Strong, Comstock got his bill introduced before the United States Senate by Republican Senator for Minnesota William Windom on February 11, 1873, as S. 1572. It was reported without amendment from the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads by Republican Senator for Minnesota Alexander Ramsey on February 13, 1873. On the following day, through motion by Republican Senator for Connecticut William A. Buckingham, it was recommitted back to that committee. It was later reported with an amendment (by Senator Buckingham) for consideration before the Committee of the Whole, but its consideration was postponed through motion by Democratic Senator for Ohio Allen G. Thurman on February 18, 1873. Consideration was postponed yet again, this time through motion by Senator Buckingham on February 20, 1873. On February 21, 1873, the bill passed, with the Buckingham amendment, in the Senate by unanimous consent after being read three times. The bill passed without objection in the United States House of Representatives on March 1, 1873. Finally, the Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 3, 1873.

=== Further legislative context ===

==== YMCA ====
In February 1866, the executive committee of the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) of New York privately distributed a report, written by Cephas Brainerd and Robert McBurney, entitled, &quot;A Memorandum Respecting New-York as a Field for Moral and Christian Effort Among Young Men&quot;. This memorandum linked the main message of the YMCA to facts and figures drawn from census, tax, and licensing data. All of this data was used to support the belief held by the Association&#x27;s leadership that many of its younger and less supervised members had ample time in the evenings to leisure about in bars, casinos, and brothels. The 1866 memorandum was used to support a plan to construct a centrally located building to better serve the younger men of New York. However, the memorandum also recommended, in addition to this new building, a &quot;call to action&quot; by the organization&#x27;s members to investigate whether or not there were any local anti-vice laws in New York. Upon concluding there were none, the group lobbied in the New York State legislature for an anti-vice law. The New York YMCA-drafted bill was successfully enacted in 1868, although with less comprehensive language than had been first proposed. This 1868 law enabled local magistrate judges to issue warrants allowing police to seize and later destroy (upon a guilty verdict) materials ruled &quot;obscene&quot;.

==== Anthony Comstock ====
Anthony Comstock, anti-vice activist and namesake of the Comstock Act, got his political start when he campaigned against saloons in Brooklyn. Later introduced to the YMCA, Comstock would form close ties with the organization. Along his career, he became unhappy with the before-mentioned New York law and believed in a need for federal legislation. In 1872, Comstock managed to get the initial provision of the Comstock Act added as a rider to a postal service consolidation bill. Although Comstock had hoped this initial law would be enough to mitigate the postal service&#x27;s use in facilitating &quot;vice&quot;, he soon became disappointed as gaps in the law appeared. To remedy these perceived problems, Comstock worked on a new stand-alone piece of legislation, discussed previously, which passed in 1873. Anthony Comstock later secured a position as a United States Postal Inspector. In spite of this, the Committee for the Suppression of Vice at the New York YMCA, which would later splinter off to become the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, requested that he not be given a government salary. By preventing Comstock from receiving a federal salary, as well as any other publicly funded compensation, the organization&#x27;s directors attempted to prevent claims of self-serving motives and to ensure that Comstock was dependent on their donations.

Extended works of Comstock along the lines of these laws include a petition from the Committee for the Suppression of Vice to include obscene written works that were enclosed in a sealed envelope, an item that was not covered in many renditions of Comstock-style laws, as an item to convict for a punishable offense. Other works that he tried to enclose under the range of the laws that used his namesake include international art pieces that depicted scantily-clad women, textbooks for medical students, and other sexually non-explicit items. These efforts left some of his supporters to doubt his intentions. Comstock&#x27;s career as a postal inspector yielded over 3,600 arrests and the destruction of over 160 tons () of material ruled to be obscene.

== Historical discourse ==

=== Historical support ===
==== Obscenity arguments ====
As the chief proponent of the law, many of Comstock&#x27;s justifications revolved around what he believed were the negative effects obscenity would have on children. He argued that moral decay was occurring in schools and in the home because of obscene literature, something he believed youth had easy access to. He also argued that allowing obscenity to flourish in broader society would cause a social breakdown of traditional marriage and of religious institutions. Comstock leaned on support from wealthier families for the majority of his legislative and political success. Clinton L. Merrian, who aided the Comstock Act&#x27;s passage through the House of Representatives, campaigned its passage on the idea that obscenity threatened masculinity and that in order to protect it, the mailing of obscene materials needed to be outlawed.

==== Contraception arguments ====
As it originally implicated contraceptives, it was argued by some supporters that the Act would help prevent &quot;illicit&quot; sexual relations between unmarried persons, since without contraception, the unmarried would be deterred from having sex due to the possibility of unintended pregnancy. Father Coughlin, a Catholic priest and radio broadcaster, argued in support of the Act before a 1934 congressional committee, characterizing non-procreative sex as &quot;legalized prostitution&quot;. During his testimony, there was heckling from the audience, with one woman calling out to Coughlin, &quot;You&#x27;re ridiculous.&quot;

=== Historical opposition ===
==== 1878 repeal attempt ====
Four years after the enactment of the federal law, a petition was circulated by the National Liberal League for its repeal in 1876, garnering between 40,000 and 70,000 signatures. Although the petition received positive press coverage, the efforts were stymied when Anthony Comstock showed samples of pornographic material to congressional leaders serving on the same committee for which the proposed repeal act was referred. Comstock claimed that the pamphlets he had shared, a &quot;collection of smutty circulars describing sex depravity&quot;, had been distributed by mail to youths and other persons.

In March 1879, the National Defense Association submitted a letter of affidavits to Samuel Sullivan Cox, a congressional representative from New York, for review with the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads. The National Defense Association had been established in opposition shortly after the enactment of the Comstock Act. The letter of affidavits had been sent in support of the petition from the National Liberal League. Anthony Comstock dismissed the petition after hearing about it, and he asserted that the list was made up of forged signatures and false names. Comstock would also go onto lambast the media for supporting the effort.

==== Birth control movement failures ====
After the 19th century failures, there was no concerted effort to change Comstock-style laws until the start of the birth control movement in the United States in 1914, led by Margaret Sanger. Between 1917 and 1925, bills were introduced in California (1917), New York (1917, 1921,1923, 1924,1925), Connecticut (1923, 1925), and New Jersey (1925) to make the contraceptive provisions of state laws less restrictive. In both California and Connecticut, work was undertaken to simply have the contraceptive control provisions eliminated. All these state attempts at change failed to come to a vote so no change happened. There were also failed attempts to eliminate the restrictions on contraceptives from the federal law too, first starting in 1919 with the bill&#x27;s supposed sponsor failing to introduce legislation. In 1923 a similar bill was reported before the Judiciary Committee, and while it was thought that the majority of this committee favored the bill, they evaded voting on it. There were also more attempts at change in the 1920s.

==== Free Love ====
The Free Love movement of the Victorian-era United States was a group that made sustained attempts to repeal Comstock-style laws and discredit anything related to the anti-vice movement. This open distaste made free-love movement participants a major target of Anthony Comstock during his personal campaign against perceived obscenity. Comstock actively targeted individuals associated with the Free Love Movement, particularly those advocating for birth control and against traditional marriage.

Anthony Comstock used the law bearing his namesake to go after those he perceived as promoting immorality. One of Comstock&#x27;s notable targets was Victoria Woodhull, a prominent figure in the Free Love Movement and an advocate for women&#x27;s rights. Woodhull and her sister, Tennessee Claflin, published a newspaper called &quot;Woodhull &amp; Claflin&#x27;s Weekly&quot; which promoted ideas about sexuality that challenged then-prevailing societal norms. Comstock had Woodhull arrested and charged with obscenity for publishing information about contraception.

<text>An organic light-emitting diode (OLED), also known as organic electroluminescent (organic EL) diode, is a type of light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is an organic compound film that emits light in response to an electric current. This organic layer is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, and portable systems such as smartphones and handheld game consoles. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.

There are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) which has a slightly different mode of operation. An OLED display can be driven with a passive-matrix (PMOLED) or active-matrix (AMOLED) control scheme. In the PMOLED scheme, each row and line in the display is controlled sequentially, one by one, whereas AMOLED control uses a thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane to directly access and switch each individual pixel on or off, allowing for higher resolution and larger display sizes. OLEDs are fundamentally different from LEDs, which are based on a p–n diode crystalline solid structure. In LEDs, doping is used to create p- and n-regions by changing the conductivity of the host semiconductor. OLEDs do not employ a crystalline p-n structure. Doping of OLEDs is used to increase radiative efficiency by direct modification of the quantum-mechanical optical recombination rate. Doping is additionally used to determine the wavelength of photon emission.

OLED displays are made in a similar way to LCDs, including manufacturing of several displays on a mother substrate that is later thinned and cut into several displays. Substrates for OLED displays come in the same sizes as those used for manufacturing LCDs. For OLED manufacture, after the formation of TFTs (for active matrix displays), addressable grids (for passive matrix displays), or indium tin oxide (ITO) segments (for segment displays), the display is coated with hole injection, transport and blocking layers, as well with electroluminescent material after the first two layers, after which ITO or metal may be applied again as a cathode. Later, the entire stack of materials is encapsulated. The TFT layer, addressable grid, or ITO segments serve as or are connected to the anode, which may be made of ITO or metal. OLEDs can be made flexible and transparent, with transparent displays being used in smartphones with optical fingerprint scanners and flexible displays being used in foldable smartphones.

== History ==
André Bernanose and co-workers at the Nancy-Université in France made the first observations of electroluminescence in organic materials in the early 1950s. They applied high alternating voltages in air to materials such as acridine orange dye, either deposited on or dissolved in cellulose or cellophane thin films. The proposed mechanism was either direct excitation of the dye molecules or excitation of electrons.

In 1960, Martin Pope and some of his co-workers at New York University in the United States developed ohmic dark-injecting electrode contacts to organic crystals. They further described the necessary energetic requirements (work functions) for hole and electron injecting electrode contacts. These contacts are the basis of charge injection in all modern OLED devices. Pope&#x27;s group also first observed direct current (DC) electroluminescence under vacuum on a single pure crystal of anthracene and on anthracene crystals doped with tetracene in 1963 using a small area silver electrode at 400 volts. The proposed mechanism was field-accelerated electron excitation of molecular fluorescence.

Pope&#x27;s group reported in 1965 that in the absence of an external electric field, the electroluminescence in anthracene crystals is caused by the recombination of a thermalized electron and hole, and that the conducting level of anthracene is higher in energy than the exciton energy level. Also in 1965, Wolfgang Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, tetracene, and graphite powder. Their proposed mechanism involved electronic excitation at the contacts between the graphite particles and the anthracene molecules.

The first Polymer LED (PLED) to be created was by Roger Partridge at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom. It used a film of polyvinylcarbazole up to 2.2 micrometers thick located between two charge-injecting electrodes. The light generated was readily visible in normal lighting conditions though the polymer used had 2 limitations; low conductivity and the difficulty of injecting electrons. Later development of conjugated polymers would allow others to largely eliminate these problems. His contribution has often been overlooked due to the secrecy NPL imposed on the project. When it was patented in 1974 it was given a deliberately obscure &quot;catch all&quot; name while the government&#x27;s Department for Industry tried and failed to find industrial collaborators to fund further development.

===Practical OLEDs===
Chemists Ching Wan Tang and Steven Van Slyke at Eastman Kodak built the first practical OLED device in 1987. This device used a two-layer structure with separate hole transporting and electron transporting layers such that recombination and light emission occurred in the middle of the organic layer; this resulted in a reduction in operating voltage and improvements in efficiency.

Research into polymer electroluminescence culminated in 1990, with J. H. Burroughes at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, UK, reporting a high-efficiency green light-emitting polymer-based device using 100nm thick films of poly(p-phenylene vinylene). Moving from molecular to macromolecular materials solved the problems previously encountered with the long-term stability of the organic films and enabled high-quality films to be easily made. Subsequent research developed multilayer polymers and the new field of plastic electronics and OLED research and device production grew rapidly. White OLEDs, pioneered by J. Kido et al. at Yamagata University, Japan in 1995, achieved the commercialization of OLED-backlit displays and lighting.

In 1999, Kodak and Sanyo had entered into a partnership to jointly research, develop, and produce OLED displays. They announced the world&#x27;s first 2.4-inch active-matrix, full-color OLED display in September the same year. In September 2002, they presented a prototype of 15-inch HDTV format display based on white OLEDs with color filters at the CEATEC Japan.

Manufacturing of small molecule OLEDs was started in 1997 by Pioneer Corporation, followed by TDK in 2001 and Samsung-NEC Mobile Display (SNMD), which later became one of the world&#x27;s largest OLED display manufacturers - Samsung Display, in 2002.

The Sony XEL-1, released in 2007, was the first OLED television. Universal Display Corporation, one of the OLED materials companies, holds a number of patents concerning the commercialization of OLEDs that are used by major OLED manufacturers around the world.

On 5 December 2017, JOLED, the successor of Sony and Panasonic&#x27;s printable OLED business units, began the world&#x27;s first commercial shipment of inkjet-printed OLED panels.

== Working principle ==
A typical OLED is composed of a layer of organic materials situated between two electrodes, the anode and cathode, all deposited on a substrate. The organic molecules are electrically conductive as a result of delocalization of pi electrons caused by conjugation over part or all of the molecule. These materials have conductivity levels ranging from insulators to conductors, and are therefore considered organic semiconductors. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of organic semiconductors are analogous to the valence and conduction bands of inorganic semiconductors.

Originally, the most basic polymer OLEDs consisted of a single organic layer. One example was the first light-emitting device synthesised by J. H. Burroughes &quot;et al.&quot;, which involved a single layer of poly(p-phenylene vinylene). However multilayer OLEDs can be fabricated with two or more layers in order to improve device efficiency. As well as conductive properties, different materials may be chosen to aid charge injection at electrodes by providing a more gradual electronic profile, or block a charge from reaching the opposite electrode and being wasted. Many modern OLEDs incorporate a simple bilayer structure, consisting of a conductive layer and an emissive layer. Developments in OLED architecture in 2011 improved quantum efficiency (up to 19%) by using a graded heterojunction. In the graded heterojunction architecture, the composition of hole and electron-transport materials varies continuously within the emissive layer with a dopant emitter. The graded heterojunction architecture combines the benefits of both conventional architectures by improving charge injection while simultaneously balancing charge transport within the emissive region.

During operation, a voltage is applied across the OLED such that the anode is positive with respect to the cathode. Anodes are picked based upon the quality of their optical transparency, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. A current of electrons flows through the device from cathode to anode, as electrons are injected into the LUMO of the organic layer at the cathode and withdrawn from the HOMO at the anode. This latter process may also be described as the injection of electron holes into the HOMO. Electrostatic forces bring the electrons and the holes towards each other and they recombine forming an exciton, a bound state of the electron and hole. This happens closer to the electron-transport layer part of the emissive layer, because in organic semiconductors holes are generally more mobile than electrons. The decay of this excited state results in a relaxation of the energy levels of the electron, accompanied by emission of radiation whose frequency is in the visible region. The frequency of this radiation depends on the band gap of the material, in this case the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO.

As electrons and holes are fermions with half integer spin, an exciton may either be in a singlet state or a triplet state depending on how the spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet exciton. Decay from triplet states (phosphorescence) is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent OLED emissive layers and devices. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) or emissive layers make use of spin–orbit interactions to facilitate intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.

Indium tin oxide (ITO) is commonly used as the anode material. It is transparent to visible light and has a high work function which promotes injection of holes into the HOMO level of the organic layer. A second conductive (injection) layer is typically added, which may consist of , as the HOMO level of this material generally lies between the work function of ITO and the HOMO of other commonly used polymers, reducing the energy barriers for hole injection. Metals such as barium and calcium are often used for the cathode as they have low work functions which promote injection of electrons into the LUMO of the organic layer. Such metals are reactive, so they require a capping layer of aluminium to avoid degradation. Two secondary benefits of the aluminum capping layer include robustness to electrical contacts and the back reflection of emitted light out to the transparent ITO layer.

Experimental research has proven that the properties of the anode, specifically the anode/hole transport layer (HTL) interface topography plays a major role in the efficiency, performance, and lifetime of organic light-emitting diodes. Imperfections in the surface of the anode decrease anode-organic film interface adhesion, increase electrical resistance, and allow for more frequent formation of non-emissive dark spots in the OLED material adversely affecting lifetime. Mechanisms to decrease anode roughness for ITO/glass substrates include the use of thin films and self-assembled monolayers. Also, alternative substrates and anode materials are being considered to increase OLED performance and lifetime. Possible examples include single crystal sapphire substrates treated with gold (Au) film anodes yielding lower work functions, operating voltages, electrical resistance values, and increasing lifetime of OLEDs.

Single carrier devices are typically used to study the kinetics and charge transport mechanisms of an organic material and can be useful when trying to study energy transfer processes. As current through the device is composed of only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, recombination does not occur and no light is emitted. For example, electron only devices can be obtained by replacing ITO with a lower work function metal which increases the energy barrier of hole injection. Similarly, hole only devices can be made by using a cathode made solely of aluminium, resulting in an energy barrier too large for efficient electron injection.

== Carrier balance ==
Balanced charge injection and transfer are required to get high internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing the thickness of the charge transporting layers but is hard to control. Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (p-type) and electron-transporting (n-type) side chains to localize electron-hole pairs. Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency. An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole-doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external quantum efficiency and color purity in no optimized OLED.

== Material technologies ==
=== Small molecules ===
Organic small-molecule electroluminescent materials have the advantages of a wide variety, easy to purify, and strong chemical modifications. In order to make the luminescent materials to emit light as required, some chromophores or unsaturated groups such as alkene bonds and benzene rings will usually be introduced in the molecular structure design to change the size of the conjugation range of the material, so that the photophysical properties of the material changes. In general, the larger the range of π-electron conjugation system, the longer the wavelength of light emitted by the material. For instance, with the increase of the number of benzene rings, the fluorescence emission peak of benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and tetracene gradually red-shifted from 283 nm to 480 nm. Common organic small molecule electroluminescent materials include aluminum complexes, anthracenes, biphenyl acetylene aryl derivatives, coumarin derivatives, and various fluorochromes. Efficient OLEDs using small molecules were first developed by Ching W. Tang &quot;et al.&quot; at Eastman Kodak. The term OLED traditionally refers specifically to this type of device, though the term SM-OLED is also in use.

Molecules commonly used in OLEDs include organometallic chelates (for example Alq3, used in the organic light-emitting device reported by Tang &quot;et al.&quot;), fluorescent and phosphorescent dyes and conjugated dendrimers. A number of materials are used for their charge transport properties, for example triphenylamine and derivatives are commonly used as materials for hole transport layers. Fluorescent dyes can be chosen to obtain light emission at different wavelengths, and compounds such as perylene, rubrene and quinacridone derivatives are often used. Alq3 has been used as a green light emitter, electron transport material and as a host for yellow light and red light emitting dyes.

Because of the structural flexibility of small-molecule electroluminescent materials, thin films can be prepared by vacuum vapor deposition, which is more expensive and of limited use for large-area devices. The vacuum coating system, however, can make the entire process from film growth to OLED device preparation in a controlled and complete operating environment, helping to obtain uniform and stable films, thus ensuring the final fabrication of high-performance OLED devices.However, small molecule organic dyes are prone to fluorescence quenching in the solid state, resulting in lower luminescence efficiency. The doped OLED devices are also prone to crystallization, which reduces the luminescence and efficiency of the devices. Therefore, the development of devices based on small-molecule electroluminescent materials is limited by high manufacturing costs, poor stability, short life, and other shortcomings. Coherent emission from a laser dye-doped tandem SM-OLED device, excited in the pulsed regime, has been demonstrated. The emission is nearly diffraction limited with a spectral width similar to that of broadband dye lasers.

Researchers report luminescence from a single polymer molecule, representing the smallest possible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) device. Scientists will be able to optimize substances to produce more powerful light emissions. Finally, this work is a first step towards making molecule-sized components that combine electronic and optical properties. Similar components could form the basis of a molecular computer.

=== Polymer light-emitting diodes ===
Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED, P-OLED), also light-emitting polymers (LEP), involve an electroluminescent conductive polymer that emits light when connected to an external voltage. They are used as a thin film for full-spectrum colour displays. Polymer OLEDs are quite efficient and require a relatively small amount of power for the amount of light produced.

Vacuum deposition is not a suitable method for forming thin films of polymers. If the polymeric OLED films are made by vacuum vapor deposition, the chain elements will be cut off and the original photophysical properties will be compromised. However, polymers can be processed in solution, and spin coating is a common method of depositing thin polymer films. This method is more suited to forming large-area films than thermal evaporation. No vacuum is required, and the emissive materials can also be applied on the substrate by a technique derived from commercial inkjet printing. However, as the application of subsequent layers tends to dissolve those already present, formation of multilayer structures is difficult with these methods. The metal cathode may still need to be deposited by thermal evaporation in vacuum. An alternative method to vacuum deposition is to deposit a Langmuir-Blodgett film.

Typical polymers used in PLED displays include derivatives of poly(&quot;p&quot;-phenylene vinylene) and polyfluorene. Substitution of side chains onto the polymer backbone may determine the colour of emitted light or the stability and solubility of the polymer for performance and ease of processing.
While unsubstituted poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) is typically insoluble, a number of PPVs and related poly(naphthalene vinylene)s (PNVs) that are soluble in organic solvents or water have been prepared via ring opening metathesis polymerization. These water-soluble polymers or conjugated poly electrolytes (CPEs) also can be used as hole injection layers alone or in combination with nanoparticles like graphene.

=== Phosphorescent materials ===

Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes use the principle of electrophosphorescence to convert electrical energy in an OLED into light in a highly efficient manner, with the internal quantum efficiencies of such devices approaching 100%. PHOLEDs can be deposited using vacuum deposition through a shadow mask.

Typically, a polymer such as poly(N-vinylcarbazole) is used as a host material to which an organometallic complex is added as a dopant. Iridium complexes such as Ir(mppy)3 as of 2004 were a focus of research, although complexes based on other heavy metals such as platinum have also been used.

The heavy metal atom at the centre of these complexes exhibits strong spin-orbit coupling, facilitating intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states. By using these phosphorescent materials, both singlet and triplet excitons will be able to decay radiatively, hence improving the internal quantum efficiency of the device compared to a standard OLED where only the singlet states will contribute to emission of light.

Applications of OLEDs in solid state lighting require the achievement of high brightness with good CIE coordinates (for white emission). The use of macromolecular species like polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) in conjunction with the use of phosphorescent species such as Ir for printed OLEDs have exhibited brightnesses as high as 10,000cd/m2.

== Device architectures ==

=== Structure ===
==== Bottom emission ====

The bottom-emission organic light-emitting diode (BE-OLED) is the architecture that was used in the early-stage AMOLED displays. It had a transparent anode fabricated on a glass substrate, and a shiny reflective cathode. Light is emitted from the transparent anode direction. To reflect all the light towards the anode direction, a relatively thick metal cathode such as aluminum is used. For the anode, high-transparency indium tin oxide (ITO) was a typical choice to emit as much light as possible. Organic thin-films, including the emissive layer that actually generates the light, are then sandwiched between the ITO anode and the reflective metal cathode. The downside of bottom emission structure is that the light has to travel through the pixel drive circuits such as the thin-film transistor (TFT) substrate, and the area from which light can be extracted is limited and the light emission efficiency is reduced.

==== Top emission ====
An alternative configuration is to switch the mode of emission. A reflective anode, and a transparent (or more often semi-transparent) cathode are used so that the light emits from the cathode side, and this configuration is called top-emission OLED (TE-OLED). Unlike BEOLEDs where the anode is made of transparent conductive ITO, this time the cathode needs to be transparent, and the ITO material is not an ideal choice for the cathode because of a damage issue due to the sputtering process. Thus, a thin metal film such as pure Ag and the Mg:Ag alloy are used for the semi-transparent cathode due to their high transmittance and high conductivity. In contrast to the bottom emission, light is extracted from the opposite side in top emission without the need of passing through multiple drive circuit layers. Thus, the light generated can be extracted more efficiently.

=== Improvements ===
====Deuterium====
Using deuterium instead of hydrogen, in other words deuterated compounds, in red light , green light , blue light and white light OLED light emitting material layers and other layers nearby in OLED displays can improve their brightness by up to 30%. This is achieved by improving the current handling capacity, and lifespan of these materials.

====Micro Lens Array (MLA)====
Making indentations shaped like lenses on a transparent layer through which light passes from an OLED light emitting material, reduces the amount of scattered light within the display and directs it forward, improving brightness.

==== Micro-cavity theory ====

When light waves meet while traveling along the same medium, wave interference occurs. This interference can be constructive or destructive. It is sometimes desirable for several waves of the same frequency to sum up into a wave with higher amplitudes.

Since both electrodes are reflective in TEOLED, light reflections can happen within the diode, and they cause more complex interferences than those in BEOLEDs. In addition to the two-beam interference, there exists a multi-resonance interference between two electrodes. Because the structure of TEOLEDs is similar to that of the Fabry-Perot resonator or laser resonator, which contains two parallel mirrors comparable to the two reflective electrodes), this effect is especially strong in TEOLED. This two-beam interference and the Fabry-Perot interferences are the main factors in determining the output spectral intensity of OLED. This optical effect is called the &quot;micro-cavity effect.&quot;

In the case of OLED, that means the cavity in a TEOLED could be especially designed to enhance the light output intensity and color purity with a narrow band of wavelengths, without consuming more power. In TEOLEDs, the microcavity effect commonly occurs, and when and how to restrain or make use of this effect is indispensable for device design. To match the conditions of constructive interference, different layer thicknesses are applied according to the resonance wavelength of that specific color. The thickness conditions are carefully designed and engineered according to the peak resonance emitting wavelengths of the blue light (460 nm), green light (530 nm), and red light (610 nm) color LEDs. This technology greatly improves the light-emission efficiency of OLEDs, and are able to achieve a wider color gamut due to high color purity.

====Color filters====
In &quot;white + color filter method&quot;, also known as WOLED, red, green, and blue emissions are obtained from the same white-light LEDs using different color filters. With this method, the OLED materials produce white light, which is then filtered to obtain the desired RGB colors. This method eliminated the need to deposit three different organic emissive materials side by side, so only one kind of OLED material per layer is used to produce white light. It also eliminated the uneven degradation rate of blue pixels vs. red and green pixels. Disadvantages of this method are low color purity and contrast. Also, the filters absorb most of the emitted light, requiring the background white light to be relatively strong to compensate for the drop in brightness, and thus the power consumption for such displays can be higher.

Color filters can also be implemented into bottom- and top-emission OLEDs. By adding the corresponding RGB color filters after the semi-transparent cathode, even purer wavelengths of light can be obtained. The use of a microcavity in top-emission OLEDs with color filters also contributes to an increase in the contrast ratio by reducing the reflection of incident ambient light. In a conventional panel, a circular polarizer was installed on the panel surface. While this was provided to prevent the reflection of ambient light, it also reduced the light output. By replacing this polarizing layer with color filters, the light intensity is not affected, and essentially all ambient reflected light can be cut, allowing a better contrast on the display panel. This potentially reduced the need for brighter pixels and can lower the power consumption.

=== Other architectures ===
====Transparent OLEDs====
Transparent OLEDs use transparent or semi-transparent contacts on both sides of the device to create displays that can be made to be both top and bottom emitting (transparent). TOLEDs can greatly improve contrast, making it much easier to view displays in bright sunlight. This technology can be used in head-up displays, smart windows or augmented reality applications.

====Graded heterojunction====
Graded heterojunction OLEDs gradually decrease the ratio of electron holes to electron transporting chemicals. This results in almost double the quantum efficiency of existing OLEDs.

====Stacked OLEDs====
Stacked OLEDs use a pixel architecture that stacks the red, green, and blue subpixels on top of one another instead of next to one another, leading to substantial increase in gamut and color depth, and greatly reducing pixel gap. Other display technologies with RGB (and RGBW) pixels mapped next to each other, tend to decrease potential resolution.

Tandem OLEDs are similar but have 2 layers of the same color stacked together. This improves the brightness of OLED displays.

====Inverted OLED====
In contrast to a conventional OLED, in which the anode is placed on the substrate, an inverted OLED uses a bottom cathode that can be connected to the drain end of an n-channel TFT, especially for the low-cost amorphous silicon TFT backplane useful in the manufacturing of AMOLED displays.

All OLED displays (passive and active matrix) use a driver IC, often mounted using the chip-on-glass (COG) technology with an anisotropic conductive film.

== Color patterning technologies ==
=== Shadow mask patterning method ===
The most commonly used patterning method for organic light-emitting displays is shadow masking during film deposition, also called the &quot;RGB side-by-side&quot; method or &quot;RGB pixelation&quot; method. Metal sheets with multiple apertures made of low thermal expansion material, such as nickel alloy, are placed between the heated evaporation source and substrate, so that the organic or inorganic material from the evaporation source is masked off, or blocked by the sheet from reaching the substrate in most locations, so the materials are deposited only on the desired locations on the substrate, and the rest is deposited and remains on the sheet. Almost all small OLED displays for smartphones have been manufactured using this method.
Fine metal masks (FMMs) made by photochemical machining, reminiscent of old CRT shadow masks, are used in this process. The dot density of the mask will determine the pixel density of the finished display. Fine Hybrid Masks (FHMs) are lighter than FFMs, reducing bending caused by the mask&#x27;s own weight, and are made using an electroforming process.
This method requires heating the electroluminescent materials at 300 °C using a thermal method in a high vacuum of 10Pa. An oxygen meter ensures that no oxygen enters the chamber as it could damage (through oxidation) the electroluminescent material, which is in powder form. The mask is aligned with the mother substrate before every use, and it is placed just below the substrate. The substrate and mask assembly are placed at the top of the deposition chamber. Afterwards, the electrode layer is deposited, by subjecting silver and aluminum powder to 1000 °C, using an electron beam. Shadow masks allow for high pixel densities of up to . High pixel densities are
necessary for virtual reality headsets.

=== White + color filter method (WOLED) ===
Although the shadow-mask patterning method is a mature technology used from the first OLED manufacturing, it causes many issues like dark spot formation due to mask-substrate contact or misalignment of the pattern due to the deformation of shadow mask. Such defect formation can be regarded as trivial when the display size is small, however it causes serious issues when a large display is manufactured, which brings significant production yield loss. To circumvent such issues, white emission devices with 4-sub-pixel color filters (white, red, green and blue) have been used for large televisions. In spite of the light absorption by the color filter, state-of-the-art OLED televisions can reproduce color very well, such as 100% NTSC, and consume little power at the same time. This is done by using an emission spectrum with high human-eye sensitivity, special color filters with a low spectrum overlap, and performance tuning with color statistics into consideration.
This approach is also called the &quot;Color-by-white&quot; method.

=== Other color patterning approaches ===
There are other types of emerging patterning technologies to increase the manufacturability of OLEDs.
Patternable organic light-emitting devices use a light or heat activated electroactive layer. A latent material (PEDOT-TMA) is included in this layer that, upon activation, becomes highly efficient as a hole injection layer. Using this process, light-emitting devices with arbitrary patterns can be prepared.

Colour patterning can be accomplished by means of a laser, such as a radiation-induced sublimation transfer (RIST).

Organic vapour jet printing (OVJP) uses an inert carrier gas, such as argon or nitrogen, to transport evaporated organic molecules (as in organic vapour phase deposition). The gas is expelled through a micrometre-sized nozzle or nozzle array close to the substrate as it is being translated. This allows printing arbitrary multilayer patterns without the use of solvents.

Like ink jet material deposition, inkjet etching (IJE) deposits precise amounts of solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve the substrate material and induce a structure or pattern. Inkjet etching of polymer layers in OLEDs can be used to increase the overall out-coupling efficiency. In OLEDs, light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by total internal reflection (TIR). This trapped light is wave-guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission. Inkjet etching can be used to selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out-coupling efficiency of the OLED. Compared to a non-etched polymer layer, the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device. IJE solvents are commonly organic instead of water-based due to their non-acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water.

Transfer-printing is an emerging technology to assemble large numbers of parallel OLED and AMOLED devices efficiently. It takes advantage of standard metal deposition, photolithography, and etching to create alignment marks commonly on glass or other device substrates. Thin polymer adhesive layers are applied to enhance resistance to particles and surface defects. Microscale ICs are transfer-printed onto the adhesive surface and then baked to fully cure adhesive layers. An additional photosensitive polymer layer is applied to the substrate to account for the topography caused by the printed ICs, reintroducing a flat surface. Photolithography and etching removes some polymer layers to uncover conductive pads on the ICs. Afterwards, the anode layer is applied to the device backplane to form the bottom electrode. OLED layers are applied to the anode layer with conventional vapor deposition, and covered with a conductive metal electrode layer. transfer-printing was capable to print onto target substrates up to 500mm × 400mm. This size limit needs to expand for transfer-printing to become a common process for the fabrication of large OLED/AMOLED displays.

Experimental OLED displays using conventional photolithography techniques instead of FMMs have been demonstrated, allowing for large substrate sizes (as it eliminates the need for a mask that needs to be as large as the substrate) and good yield control. Visionox has announced the use of photolithography for depositing OLED emissive materials.

== Thin-film transistor backplanes ==
For a high resolution display like a TV, a thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane is necessary to drive the pixels correctly. As of 2019, low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS)– TFT is widely used for commercial AMOLED displays due to its superior current handling capacity over amorphous silicon (a-Si) TFTs. LTPS-TFT has variation of the performance in a display, so various compensation circuits have been reported. Due to the size limitation of the excimer laser used for LTPS, the AMOLED size was limited. To cope with the hurdle related to the panel size, amorphous-silicon/microcrystalline-silicon backplanes have been reported with large display prototype demonstrations. An indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) backplane can also be used. Large OLED displays usually use AOS (amporphous oxide semiconductor) TFT transistors instead, also called oxide TFTs and these are usually based on IGZO.

Many AMOLED displays use LTPO TFT transistors. These transistors offer stability at low refresh rates, and variable refresh rates, which allows for power saving displays that do not show visual artifacts.

== Advantages ==

The different manufacturing process of OLEDs has several advantages over flat panel displays made with LCD technology.

; Lower cost in the future: OLEDs can be printed onto any suitable substrate by an inkjet printer or even by screen printing, theoretically making them cheaper to produce than LCD or plasma displays. However, fabrication of the OLED substrate as of 2018 is costlier than that for TFT LCDs. Roll-to-roll vapor-deposition methods for organic devices do allow mass production of thousands of devices per minute for minimal cost; however, this technique also induces problems: devices with multiple layers can be challenging to make because of registration — lining up the different printed layers to the required degree of accuracy.

; Lightweight and flexible plastic substrates: OLED displays can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates, leading to the possible fabrication of flexible organic light-emitting diodes for other new applications, such as roll-up displays embedded in fabrics or clothing. If a substrate like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be used, the displays may be produced inexpensively. Furthermore, plastic substrates are shatter-resistant, unlike the glass displays used in LCD devices. Flexible OLED displays are made on polyamide plastic films which are bonded to glass panels during production. Once the OLED display is encapsulated, a Laser is used to separate the plastic from the glass in a Laser Lift-Off (LLO) process.

; Power efficiency: LCDs filter the light emitted from a backlight, allowing a small fraction of light through. Thus, they cannot show true black. However, an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power, allowing true blacks. Removing the backlight also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed.

; Response time: OLEDs also have a much faster response time than an LCD. Using response time compensation technologies, the fastest modern LCDs can reach response times as low as 1ms for their fastest color transition, and are capable of refresh frequencies as high as 240Hz. According to LG, OLED response times are up to 1,000 times faster than LCD, putting conservative estimates at under 10μs (0.01ms), which could theoretically accommodate refresh frequencies approaching 100kHz (100,000Hz). Due to their extremely fast response time, OLED displays can also be easily designed to be strobed, creating an effect similar to CRT flicker in order to avoid the sample-and-hold behavior seen on both LCDs and some OLED displays, which creates the perception of motion blur.

; High dynamic range support: Because OLEDs can turn off individual pixels showing true black, the contrast ratio of an OLED display can be very large, which allows for representation of high dynamic range (HDR) images and video at high quality. Data must be encoded with a HDR format to display in HDR, and HDR format support varies by OLED display. Maximum (peak) brightness also varies by OLED display, which impacts the dynamic range that can be represented.

== Disadvantages ==

===Lifespan===
The biggest technical problem for OLEDs is the limited lifetime of the organic materials. One 2008 technical report on an OLED TV panel found that after 1,000hours, the blue luminance degraded by 12%, the red by 7% and the green by 8%. In particular, blue OLEDs at that time had a lifetime of around 14,000hours to half original brightness (five years at eight hours per day) when used for flat-panel displays. This is lower than the typical lifetime of LCD, LED or PDP technology; each rated for about 25,000–40,000hours to half brightness, depending on manufacturer and model. One major challenge for OLED displays is the formation of dark spots due to the ingress of oxygen and moisture, which degrades the organic material over time whether or not the display is powered. In 2016, LG Electronics reported an expected lifetime of 100,000 hours, up from 36,000 hours in 2013. A US Department of Energy paper shows that the expected lifespans of OLED lighting products goes down with increasing brightness, with an expected lifespan of 40,000 hours at 25% brightness, or 10,000 hours at 100% brightness. Compared to LCDs, OLEDs may be more susceptible to screen burn-in and/or brightness degradation.

====Degradation====

Degradation occurs because of the accumulation of nonradiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers in the emissive zone. It is said that the chemical breakdown in the semiconductors occurs in four steps:

# recombination of charge carriers through the absorption of UV light
# homolytic dissociation
# subsequent radical addition reactions that form radicals
# disproportionation between two radicals resulting in hydrogen-atom transfer reactions

In 2007, experimental OLEDs were created which can sustain 400cd/m2 of luminance for over 198,000hours for green OLEDs and 62,000hours for blue OLEDs. In 2012, OLED lifetime to half of the initial brightness was improved to 900,000hours for red, 1,450,000hours for yellow and 400,000hours for green at an initial luminance of 1,000cd/m2. Proper encapsulation is critical for prolonging an OLED display&#x27;s lifetime, as the OLED light emitting electroluminescent materials are sensitive to oxygen and moisture. When exposed to moisture or oxygen, the electroluminescent materials in OLEDs degrade as they oxidize, generating black spots and reducing or shrinking the area that emits light, reducing light output. This reduction can occur in a pixel by pixel basis. This can also lead to delamination of the electrode layer, eventually leading to complete panel failure.

Degradation occurs three orders of magnitude faster when exposed to moisture than when exposed to oxygen. Encapsulation can be performed by applying an epoxy adhesive with dessicant, by laminating a glass sheet with epoxy glue and dessicant followed by vacuum degassing, or by using Thin-Film Encapsulation (TFE), which is a multi-layer coating of alternating organic and inorganic layers. The organic layers are applied using inkjet printing, and the inorganic layers are applied using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). The encapsulation process is carried out under a nitrogen environment, using UV-curable LOCA glue and the electroluminescent and electrode material deposition processes are carried out under a high vacuum. The encapsulation and material deposition processes are carried out by a single machine, after the thin-film transistors have been applied. The transistors are applied in a process that is the same for LCDs. The electroluminescent materials can also be applied using inkjet printing.

===Color balance===
The OLED material used to produce blue light degrades much more rapidly than the materials used to produce other colors; in other words, blue light output will decrease relative to the other colors of light. This variation in the differential color output will change the color balance of the display, and is much more noticeable than a uniform decrease in overall luminance. This can be avoided partially by adjusting the color balance, but this may require advanced control circuits and input from a knowledgeable user. More commonly, though, manufacturers optimize the size of the R, G and B subpixels to reduce the current density through the subpixel in order to equalize lifetime at full luminance. For example, a blue subpixel may be 75% larger than the green subpixel. The red subpixel may be 10% larger than the green.

===Efficiency of blue OLEDs===

Improvements to the efficiency and lifetime of blue OLEDs is vital to the success of OLEDs as replacements for LCD technology. Considerable research has been invested in developing blue OLEDs with high external quantum efficiency, as well as a deeper blue color.

Since 2012, research focuses on organic materials exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), discovered at Kyushu University OPERA and UC Santa Barbara CPOS. TADF would allow stable and high-efficiency solution processable (meaning that the organic materials are layered in solutions producing thinner layers) blue emitters, with internal quantum efficiencies reaching 100%. Early in 2017, TADF materials based on oxygen-based fully bridged boron-type electron accepttors had achieved huge breakthrough in their proprities. The external quantum efficiency of TADF-OLED for blue and green light had achieved 38%, with thin full-width half-maximum and high color purity. In 2022, Han et al. synthesized a new D-A type luminescent material, TDBA-Cz, and used the m-AC-DBNA synthesized by Meng et al. as a control to investigate the effect of the substitution site of the carbazole unit as an electron donor on the oxygen-bridged triphenylboron electron acceptor unit on the photophysical properties of the overall molecule. It was found that the introduction of two carbazole units into the same benzene ring of the oxygen-bridged triphenylboron electron acceptor unit could effectively suppress the conformational relaxation of the molecule during the radiative transition, resulting in narrow bandwidth blue light emission. In addition, TDBA-Cz is the first reported blue material to achieve both a FWHM down to 45 nm and a maximum EQE of 21.4% in a non-doped TADF-OLED.

Blue TADF emitters are expected to market by 2020 and would be used for WOLED displays with phosphorescent color filters, as well as blue OLED displays with ink-printed QD color filters.

===Water damage===
Water can instantly damage the organic materials of the displays. Therefore, improved sealing processes are important for practical manufacturing. Water damage especially may limit the longevity of more flexible displays.

===Outdoor performance===
As an emissive display technology, OLEDs rely completely upon converting electricity to light, unlike most LCDs which are to some extent reflective. E-paper leads the way in efficiency with ~ 33% ambient light reflectivity, enabling the display to be used without any internal light source. The metallic cathode in an OLED acts as a mirror, with reflectance approaching 80%, leading to poor readability in bright ambient light such as outdoors. However, with the proper application of a circular polarizer and antireflective coatings, the diffuse reflectance can be reduced to less than 0.1%. With 10,000 fc incident illumination (typical test condition for simulating outdoor illumination), that yields an approximate photopic contrast of 5:1. Advances in OLED technologies, however, enable OLEDs to become actually better than LCDs in bright sunlight. The AMOLED display in the Galaxy S5, for example, was found to outperform all LCD displays on the market in terms of power usage, brightness and reflectance.

===Power consumption===
While an OLED will consume around 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black, for the majority of images it will consume 60–80% of the power of an LCD. However, an OLED can use more than 300% power to display an image with a white background, such as a document or web site. This can lead to reduced battery life in mobile devices when white backgrounds are used.

=== Screen flicker ===
Many OLEDs use pulse width modulation to display colour/brightness gradations. For example, a pixel instructed to display gray will flicker on and off rapidly, creating a subtle strobe effect. The alternative way to decrease brightness would be to decrease power to the display, which would eliminate screen flicker to the detriment of colour balance, which deteriorates as brightness decreases. However, use of PWM gradations may be more harmful for eye health.

==Manufacturers and commercial uses==


Almost all OLED manufacturers rely on material deposition equipment that is only made by a handful of companies, the most notable one being Canon Tokki, a unit of Canon Inc. although Ulvac and Sunic System are also notable. Canon Tokki is reported to have a near-monopoly of the giant OLED-manufacturing vacuum machines, notable for their size. Apple has relied solely on Canon Tokki in its bid to introduce its own OLED displays for the iPhones released in 2017. The electroluminescent materials needed for OLEDs are also made by a handful of companies, some of them being Merck, Universal Display Corporation and LG Chem. The machines that apply these materials can operate continuously for 5–6 days, and can process a mother substrate in 5 minutes.

OLED displays are mainly made by Samsung Display and LG Display. OLED technology is used in commercial applications such as displays for mobile phones and portable digital media players, car radios and digital cameras among others, as well as lighting. Such portable display applications favor the high light output of OLEDs for readability in sunlight and their low power drain. Portable displays are also used intermittently, so the lower lifespan of organic displays is less of an issue. Prototypes have been made of flexible and rollable displays which use OLEDs&#x27; unique characteristics. Applications in flexible signs and lighting are also being developed. OLED lighting offers several advantages over LED lighting, such as higher quality illumination, more diffuse light source, and panel shapes. Philips Lighting has made OLED lighting samples under the brand name &quot;Lumiblade&quot; available online and Novaled AG based in Dresden, Germany, introduced a line of OLED desk lamps called &quot;Victory&quot; in September, 2011.

Nokia introduced OLED mobile phones including the N85 and the N86 8MP, both of which feature an AMOLED display. OLEDs have also been used in most Motorola and Samsung color cell phones, as well as some HTC, LG and Sony Ericsson models. OLED technology can also be found in digital media players such as the Creative ZEN V, the iriver clix, the Zune HD and the Sony Walkman X Series.

The Google and HTC Nexus One smartphone includes an AMOLED screen, as does HTC&#x27;s own Desire and Legend phones. However, due to supply shortages of the Samsung-produced displays, certain HTC models will use Sony&#x27;s SLCD displays in the future, while the Google and Samsung Nexus S smartphone will use &quot;Super Clear LCD&quot; instead in some countries.

OLED displays were used in watches made by Fossil (JR-9465) and Diesel (DZ-7086). Other manufacturers of OLED panels include Anwell Technologies Limited (Hong Kong), AU Optronics (Taiwan), Chimei Innolux Corporation (Taiwan), LG (Korea), and others.

DuPont stated in a press release in May 2010, that they can produce a 50-inch OLED TV in two minutes with a new printing technology. If this can be scaled up in terms of manufacturing, then the total cost of OLED TVs would be greatly reduced. DuPont also states that OLED TVs made with this less expensive technology can last up to 15 years if left on for a normal eight-hour day.

The use of OLEDs may be subject to patents held by Universal Display Corporation, Eastman Kodak, DuPont, General Electric, Royal Philips Electronics, numerous universities and others. By 2008, thousands of patents associated with OLEDs, came from larger corporations and smaller technology companies.

Flexible OLED displays have been used by manufacturers to create curved displays such as the Galaxy S7 Edge but they were not in devices that can be flexed by the users. Samsung demonstrated a roll-out display in 2016.
On 31 October 2018, Royole, a Chinese electronics company, unveiled the world&#x27;s first foldable screen phone featuring a flexible OLED display. On 20 February 2019, Samsung announced the Samsung Galaxy Fold with a foldable OLED display from Samsung Display, its majority-owned subsidiary. At MWC 2019 on 25 February 2019, Huawei announced the Huawei Mate X featuring a foldable OLED display from BOE.

The 2010s also saw the wide adoption of &quot;tracking gate-line in pixel&quot; (TGP), which moves the driving circuitry from the borders of the display to in between the display&#x27;s pixels, allowing for narrow bezels.

In 2023 the German startup Inuru has announced to manufacture low-cost OLED with printing for packaging and fashion applications.

=== Fashion ===
Textiles incorporating OLEDs are an innovation in the fashion world and pose for a way to integrate lighting to bring inert objects to a whole new level of fashion. The hope is to combine the comfort and low cost properties of textile with the OLEDs properties of illumination and low energy consumption. Although this scenario of illuminated clothing is highly plausible, challenges are still a road block. Some issues include: the lifetime of the OLED, rigidness of flexible foil substrates, and the lack of research in making more fabric like photonic textiles.

=== Automotive ===
The number of automakers using OLEDs is still rare and limited to the high-end of the market. For example, the 2010 Lexus RX features an OLED display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display.

A Japanese manufacturer Pioneer Electronic Corporation produced the first car stereos with a monochrome OLED display, which was also the world&#x27;s first OLED product. The Aston Martin DB9 incorporated the world&#x27;s first automotive OLED display, which was manufactured by Yazaki, followed by the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Chevrolet Corvette C6. The 2015 Hyundai Sonata and Kia Soul EV use a 3.5-inch white PMOLED display.

===Company-specific applications===
====Samsung====

By 2004, Samsung Display, a subsidiary of South Korea&#x27;s largest conglomerate and a former Samsung-NEC joint venture, was the world&#x27;s largest OLED manufacturer, producing 40% of the OLED displays made in the world, and as of 2010, has a 98% share of the global AMOLED market. The company is leading the world of OLED industry, generating $100.2million out of the total $475million revenues in the global OLED market in 2006. As of 2006, it held more than 600 American patents and more than 2800 international patents, making it the largest owner of AMOLED technology patents.

Samsung SDI announced in 2005, the world&#x27;s largest OLED TV at the time, at . This OLED featured the highest resolution at the time, of 6.22million pixels. In addition, the company adopted active matrix-based technology for its low power consumption and high-resolution qualities. This was exceeded in January 2008, when Samsung showcased the world&#x27;s largest and thinnest OLED TV at the time, at 31inches (78cm) and 4.3mm.

In May 2008, Samsung unveiled an ultra-thin 12.1inch (30cm) laptop OLED display concept, with a 1,280×768 resolution with infinite contrast ratio. According to Woo Jong Lee, Vice President of the Mobile Display Marketing Team at Samsung SDI, the company expected OLED displays to be used in notebook PCs as soon as 2010.

In October 2008, Samsung showcased the world&#x27;s thinnest OLED display, also the first to be &quot;flappable&quot; and bendable. It measures just 0.05mm (thinner than paper), yet a Samsung staff member said that it is &quot;technically possible to make the panel thinner&quot;. To achieve this thickness, Samsung etched an OLED panel that uses a normal glass substrate. The drive circuit was formed by low-temperature polysilicon TFTs. Also, low-molecular organic EL materials were employed. The pixel count of the display is 480 × 272. The contrast ratio is 100,000:1, and the luminance is 200cd/m2. The colour reproduction range is 100% of the NTSC standard.

At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2010, Samsung demonstrated a laptop computer with a large, transparent OLED display featuring up to 40% transparency and an animated OLED display in a photo ID card.

Samsung&#x27;s 2010 AMOLED smartphones used their Super AMOLED trademark, with the Samsung Wave S8500 and Samsung i9000 Galaxy S being launched in June 2010. In January 2011, Samsung announced their Super AMOLED Plus displays, which offer several advances over the older Super AMOLED displays: real stripe matrix (50% more sub pixels), thinner form factor, brighter image and an 18% reduction in energy consumption.

At CES 2012, Samsung introduced the first 55&quot; TV screen that uses Super OLED technology.

On 8 January 2013, at CES Samsung unveiled a unique curved 4K Ultra S9 OLED television, which they state provides an &quot;IMAX-like experience&quot; for viewers.

On 13 August 2013, Samsung announced availability of a 55-inch curved OLED TV (model KN55S9C) in the US at a price point of $8999.99.

On 6 September 2013, Samsung launched its 55-inch curved OLED TV (model KE55S9C) in the United Kingdom with John Lewis.

Samsung introduced the &quot;Galaxy Round&quot; smartphone in the Korean market in October 2013. The device features a 1080p screen, measuring , that curves on the vertical axis in a rounded case. The corporation has promoted the following advantages: A new feature called &quot;Round Interaction&quot; that allows users to look at information by tilting the handset on a flat surface with the screen off, and the feel of one continuous transition when the user switches between home screens.

Samsung released a new line of OLED TVs in 2022, its first using the technology since 2013. They use panels sourced from Samsung Display; previously, LG was the sole manufacturer of OLED panels for TVs.

====Sony====
The Sony CLIÉ PEG-VZ90 was released in 2004, being the first PDA to feature an OLED screen. Other Sony products to feature OLED screens include the MZ-RH1 portable minidisc recorder, released in 2006 and the Walkman X Series.

At the 2007, Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Sony showcased a , (resolution 960×540) and , full HD resolution at OLED TV models. Both claimed 1,000,000:1 contrast ratios and total thicknesses (including bezels) of 5mm. In April 2007, Sony announced it would manufacture 1000 OLED TVs per month for market testing purposes. On 1 October 2007, Sony announced that the model XEL-1, was the first commercial OLED TV and it was released in Japan in December 2007.

In May 2007, Sony publicly unveiled a video of a flexible OLED screen which is only 0.3 millimeters thick. At the Display 2008 exhibition, Sony demonstrated a 0.2mm thick display with a resolution of 320×200 pixels and a 0.3mm thick display with 960×540 pixels resolution, one-tenth the thickness of the XEL-1.

In July 2008, a Japanese government body said it would fund a joint project of leading firms, which is to develop a key technology to produce large, energy-saving organic displays. The project involves one laboratory and 10 companies including Sony Corp. NEDO said the project was aimed at developing a core technology to mass-produce 40inch or larger OLED displays in the late 2010s.

In October 2008, Sony published results of research it carried out with the Max Planck Institute over the possibility of mass-market bending displays, which could replace rigid LCDs and plasma screens. Eventually, bendable, see-through displays could be stacked to produce 3D images with much greater contrast ratios and viewing angles than existing products.

Sony exhibited a 24.5&quot; (62cm) prototype OLED 3D television during the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2010.

In January 2011, Sony announced the PlayStation Vita handheld game console (the successor to the PSP) will feature a 5-inch OLED screen.

On 17 February 2011, Sony announced its 25&quot; (63.5cm) OLED Professional Reference Monitor aimed at the Cinema and high end Drama Post Production market.

On 25 June 2012, Sony and Panasonic announced a joint venture for creating low cost mass production OLED televisions by 2013.
Sony unveiled its first OLED TV since 2008 at CES 2017 called A1E. It revealed two other models in 2018 one at CES 2018 called A8F and other a Master Series TV called A9F. At CES 2019 they unveiled another two models one the A8G and the other another Bravia Series TV called A9G. Then, at CES 2020, they revealed the A8H, which was effectively an A9G in terms of picture quality but with some compromises due to its lower cost. At the same event, they also revealed a 48-inch version of the A9G, making this its smallest OLED TV since the XEL-1.

====LG====
On 9 April 2009, LG acquired Kodak&#x27;s OLED business and started to utilize white OLED technology. As of 2010, LG Electronics produced one model of OLED television, the 15EL9500 and had announced a OLED 3D television for March 2011. On 26 December 2011, LG officially announced the &quot;world&#x27;s largest OLED panel&quot; and featured it at CES 2012. In late 2012, LG announces the launch of the 55EM9600 OLED television in Australia.

In January 2015, LG Display signed a long-term agreement with Universal Display Corporation for the supply of OLED materials and the right to use their patented OLED emitters.

As of 2022, LG produces the world&#x27;s largest OLED TV, at 97 inches.

====Mitsubishi====
Lumiotec is the first company in the world developing and selling, since January 2011, mass-produced OLED lighting panels with such brightness and long lifetime. Lumiotec is a joint venture of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, ROHM, Toppan Printing, and Mitsui &amp; Co.
On 1 June 2011, Mitsubishi Electric installed a 6-meter OLED &#x27;sphere&#x27; in Tokyo&#x27;s Science Museum.

====Recom Group====
On 6 January 2011, Los Angeles-based technology company Recom Group introduced the first small screen consumer application of the OLED at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. This was a 2.8&quot; (7cm) OLED display being used as a wearable video name tag. At the Consumer Electronics Show in 2012, Recom Group introduced the world&#x27;s first video mic flag incorporating three 2.8&quot; (7cm) OLED displays on a standard broadcaster&#x27;s mic flag. The video mic flag allowed video content and advertising to be shown on a broadcasters standard mic flag.

====Dell====
On 6 January 2016, Dell announced the Ultrasharp UP3017Q OLED monitor at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The monitor was announced to feature a 4K UHD OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, 0.1 millisecond response time, and a contrast ratio of 400,000:1. The monitor was set to sell at a price of $4,999 and release in March, 2016, just a few months later. As the end of March rolled around, the monitor was not released to the market and Dell did not speak on reasons for the delay. Reports suggested that Dell canceled the monitor as the company was unhappy with the image quality of the OLED panel, especially the amount of color drift that it displayed when viewed from the sides. On 13 April 2017, Dell finally released the UP3017Q OLED monitor to the market at a price of $3,499 ($1,500 less than its original spoken price of $4,999 at CES 2016). In addition to the price drop, the monitor featured a 60Hz refresh rate and a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1. As of June, 2017, the monitor is no longer available to purchase from Dell&#x27;s website.

====Apple====
Apple began using OLED panels in its watches in 2015 and in its laptops in 2016 with the introduction of an OLED touchbar to the MacBook Pro. In 2017, Apple announced the introduction of their tenth anniversary iPhone X with their own optimized OLED display licensed from Universal Display Corporation. With the exception of the iPhone SE line, iPhone XR and iPhone 11, all iPhones released since then have also featured OLED displays. In 2024, Apple announced the 7th generation iPad Pro, which featured a &quot;tandem OLED&quot; panel in an attempt to increase the panel&#x27;s brightness.

====Nintendo====
A third model of Nintendo&#x27;s Switch, a hybrid gaming system, features an OLED panel in place of the original model&#x27;s LCD panel. Announced in the summer of 2021, it was released on 8 October 2021.

== Research ==
In 2014, Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC), a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings, developed an OLED panel with a 30,000-hour life, twice that of conventional OLED panels.

The search for efficient OLED materials has been extensively supported by simulation methods; it is possible to calculate important properties computationally, independent of experimental input, making materials development cheaper.

On 18 October 2018, Samsung showed of their research roadmap at their 2018 Samsung OLED Forum. This included Fingerprint on Display (FoD), Under Panel Sensor (UPS), Haptic on Display (HoD) and Sound on Display (SoD).

Various venders are also researching cameras under OLEDs (Under Display Cameras). According to IHS Markit Huawei has partnered with BOE, Oppo with China Star Optoelectronics Technology (CSOT), Xiaomi with Visionox.

In 2020, researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) proposed using human hair which is a source of carbon and nitrogen to create OLED displays.

<text>A lunar module is a lunar lander designed to allow astronauts to travel between a spacecraft in lunar orbit and the lunar surface. As of 2021, the Apollo Lunar Module is the only lunar module to have ever been used in human spaceflight, completing six lunar landings from 1969 to 1972 during the United States&#x27; Apollo program.

The LK lunar module was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1960s as a part of several Soviet crewed lunar programs. Several LK modules were flown without crew in low Earth orbit, but the LK lunar module never flew to the Moon, as the development of the N1 Rocket Launch Vehicle required for the lunar flight suffered setbacks (including several launch failures), and after the first crewed Moon landings were achieved by the United States, the Soviet Union cancelled both the N1 Rocket and the LK Lunar Module programs without any further development.

==Proposed lunar modules==
* Altair (spacecraft), a proposed lunar module for the Constellation program previously known as the Lunar Surface Access Module
* Human Landing System, a class of proposed lunar modules for NASA&#x27;s Artemis program

<doc id="191652" wikidata="Q60895" url="?curid=191652" title="Otto Hölder">
<text>Ludwig Otto Hölder (December 22, 1859 – August 29, 1937) was a German mathematician born in Stuttgart.

==Early life and education==
Hölder was the youngest of three sons of professor Otto Hölder (1811–1890), and a grandson of professor Christian Gottlieb Hölder (1776–1847); his two brothers also became professors. He first studied at the &quot;Polytechnikum&quot; (which today is the University of Stuttgart) and then in 1877 went to Berlin where he was a student of Leopold Kronecker, Karl Weierstrass, and Ernst Kummer.

In 1877, he entered the University of Berlin and took his doctorate from the University of Tübingen in 1882. The title of his doctoral thesis was &quot;Beiträge zur Potentialtheorie&quot; (&quot;Contributions to potential theory&quot;). Following this, he went to the University of Leipzig but was unable to habilitate there, instead earning a second doctorate and habilitation at the University of Göttingen, both in 1884.

==Academic career and later life==
He was unable to get government approval for a faculty position in Göttingen, and instead was offered a position as extraordinary professor at Tübingen in 1889. Temporary mental incapacitation delayed his acceptance but he began working there in 1890. In 1899, he took the former chair of Sophus Lie as a full professor at the University of Leipzig. There he served as dean from 1912 to 1913, and as rector in 1918.

He married Helene, the daughter of a bank director and politician, in 1899. They had two sons and two daughters. His son Ernst Hölder became another mathematician, and his daughter Irmgard married mathematician Aurel Wintner.

In 1933, Hölder signed the &quot;Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State&quot;.

==Mathematical contributions==
Holder&#x27;s inequality, named for Hölder, was actually proven earlier by Leonard James Rogers. It is named for a paper in which Hölder, citing Rogers, reproves it; in turn, the same paper includes a proof of what is now called Jensen&#x27;s inequality, with some side conditions that were later removed by Jensen.
Hölder is also noted for many other theorems including the Jordan–Hölder theorem, the theorem stating that every linearly ordered group that satisfies an Archimedean property is isomorphic to a subgroup of the additive group of real numbers, the classification of simple groups of order up to 200, the anomalous outer automorphisms of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;6, and Hölder&#x27;s theorem, which implies that the Gamma function satisfies no algebraic differential equation. Another idea related to his name is the Hölder condition (or Hölder continuity), which is used in many areas of analysis, including the theories of partial differential equations and function spaces.

<text>The River Tees (), in England, rises on the eastern slope of Cross Fell in the North Pennines and flows eastwards for to reach the North Sea in the North East of England. The modern-day history of the river has been tied with the industries on Teesside in its lower reaches, where it has provided the means of import and export of goods to and from the North East England. The need for water further downstream also meant that reservoirs were built in the extreme upper reaches, such as Cow Green.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tees&quot; is possibly of Brittonic origin.
The element &quot;*tēs&quot;, meaning &quot;warmth&quot; with connotations of &quot;boiling, excitement&quot; (Welsh &quot;tes&quot;), may underlie the name.

&quot;*Teihx-s&quot;, a root possibly derived from Brittonic &quot;*ti&quot; (Welsh &quot;tail&quot;, &quot;dung, manure&quot;), has also been used to explain the name &quot;Tees&quot; (compare River Tyne).
==Geography==
The river drains and has a number of tributaries including the River Greta, River Lune, River Balder, River Leven and River Skerne. Before the reorganisation of the historic English counties, the river formed the boundary between County Durham and Yorkshire. In its lower reaches it now forms the boundary between the ceremonial counties of County Durham and North Yorkshire, while in the highest part of its course it forms the boundary between the historic counties of Westmorland and Durham. The head of Teesdale (the name of valley especially at this end), has a desolate grandeur, surrounded by moorland and hills, some exceeding . This area is part of the North Pennine Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The source of the river at Teeshead just below Cross Fell is at an elevation of about . It flows east-north-east through an area of shake holes through Carboniferous Limestone. Below Viewing Hill, it turns south to the Cow Green Reservoir constructed to store water to be released in dry conditions to satisfy the industrial need for water on Teesside.

Emerging from the reservoir at Cauldron Snout the river traverses a series of hard black basalt and dolerite rocks that intrude through the softer limestone, in a succession of falls or rapids. From this point downstream the Tees forms the boundary between the traditional counties of Durham and Yorkshire almost without a break, although since 1974 much of it is wholly in Durham. The dale widens below Cauldron Snout, and trees appear, contrasting with the broken rocks where the water descends over High Force. After a short turn northwards, the river continues to meander south-easterly. Close to where the B6277 road begins to run parallel to the river is the High Force waterfall. About downstream is the smaller Low Force waterfall.
The scenery becomes gentler and more picturesque as the river descends past Middleton-in-Teesdale (Durham). This locality has lead and ironstone resources. Just to the east of Middleton-in-Teesdale, the River Lune joins the Tees. After passing the village of Romaldkirk to the west, the river is joined by the River Balder at Cotherstone. The ancient town of Barnard Castle, Egglestone Abbey, and Rokeby Park, known through Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s poem &quot;Rokeby&quot;, are all passed. At Rokeby the Tees is joined by the River Greta. From the area near Eggleston, the river is crossing over millstone grit. From here the valley begins to open out, and traverses the rich plain east and south of Darlington in large meandering curves.

The course of the valley down to here has been generally east-south-east, but it now turns north-east near the village of Whorlton. Passing Ovington and Winston it runs parallel to the A67 south-east past Gainford and Piercebridge to Darlington, passing under the A1 and A66. The section from Piercebridge to Hurworth flows over magnesian limestone. It is at Croft-on-Tees that the River Skerne joins the Tees. The river now flows south past Croft-on-Tees before swinging northwards past Hurworth-on-Tees. A series of large meanders takes the course past Neasham, Low Dinsdale and Sockburn to Middleton St George. In the lower reaches of the river valley the water flows over bunter sandstone and pebble beds.

Just past Yarm, the River Leven joins the Tees, before passing the settlements of Eaglescliffe, Ingleby Barwick and Thornaby-on-Tees. Now nearing the sea, the Tees becomes an important commercial waterway, with the ports of Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough on its banks. It passes through the Tees Barrage between these ports, turning tidal downstream from the barrage.

Teesport is built on reclaimed land on the south side of the Tees estuary below Middlesbrough. A direct line from the source of the Tees to Teesmouth is , but due to the meandering of the river, it flows for over .

==Water levels==
* Low and high water levels are an average figure.

==Seal Sands==

Before the heavy industrialisation of the Tees, the flats at Seal Sands in the estuary were home to common seals. For around 100 years this species was absent from the estuary but have now returned and can be seen on the flats at Seal Sands. The Seal Sands area is now designated as the Teesmouth National Nature Reserve.

==Alterations==

A proposal was made in 1769 to make &quot;cuts&quot; in the river which would straighten the course and enable ships to save time and money in navigation. Between Stockton-on-Tees and Middlesbrough, the river previously meandered first south and then north of its current channel. Two &quot;cuts&quot;, known as the Mandale Cut and the Portrack Cut, were made to straighten its course in 1810 and 1831 respectively. Before these cuts were made, the journey by sailing barge from Thornaby to the mouth of the Tees, allowing for tides and other factors, could take as long as seven days. The Mandale Cut was the shorter of the two, at about , with the Portrack Cut being considerably longer (), although the northern meander it removed was smaller than the southern meander. Neither meander is visible today, except for the flow of Stainsby Beck into a waterway which is marked on maps first as &quot;The Fleet&quot; and then &quot;Old River Tees&quot;. The current Tees Barrage is close to the site of the Mandale Cut.

Since the cuts were made, the river has continued to undergo alterations to its bed and banks to make it deeper and more navigable. The channel has been made considerably narrower by dumping ship&#x27;s ballast and ironworks slag along the former banks, increasing the scouring due to its natural flow. Maps made prior to 1900 show that between Stockton and Middlesbrough the river flowed in a channel up to wide in places, with many shoals and sandbars. The modern channel varies between about and .

In October 2021 the UK engineering company, GRAHAM, started work on the South Bank Quay project to provide a deep water facility. It is expected that two million tonnes of material will be dredged to allow GE Renewable Energy to load huge wind turbine blades onto ships. The long blades are destined for the Dogger Bank wind farm. The Heavy Fuel Oil Farm and Tarmac jetties are to be removed.

==Industry==
The River Tees has been used for transporting industrial goods since the Industrial Revolution, particularly for the shipment of coal from the Durham Coalfields and also for the steel industries that later developed around Middlesbrough. In the early years merchant ships left the River Tees after loading in Yarm and Stockton on Tees; but as merchant ships became bigger, these smaller docks were superseded by bigger and deeper docks in Middlesbrough, and later even further downstream at Teesport close to the mouth of the River Tees. The emergence of the Steel industry in the late 19th century earned it the nickname &quot;The Steel River&quot; owing to the many steelworks that operated along the banks of the Tees. In the 20th century the river also became important to the developing chemical industry, contributing particularly to the development of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) who used reclaimed land on the north bank for import/export facilities.

The move to loading coal on bigger ships in Middlesbrough was the economic driver for the development not only of the town of Middlesbrough itself but also of the railway between Stockton and Darlington. This is where George Stephenson developed his railway engine &quot;Locomotion&quot; and this railway was the first steam railway to carry passengers, as well as industrial materials. The Stockton and Darlington Railway was founded after an initial shareholders&#x27; meeting in a room in a public house in Yarm.

Today Teesport is owned by PD Ports; it is located close to the North Sea and east of Middlesbrough. Teesport is currently the third largest port in the United Kingdom, and among the ten biggest in Western Europe, handling over 56 million tonnes of domestic and international cargo per year. The vast majority of these products are still related to the steel and chemical industries made by companies that are members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). The areas where large scale commodity chemical industry continues to be based are Billingham and Seal Sands, both on the north bank of the River Tees, and Wilton on the south bank. The Teesside Steelworks at Redcar operated until closure in 2015.

Other industrial companies that use the River Tees are manufacturing and servicing the North Sea oil and gas industry as well as the renewable energy industry sector, including offshore wind turbines. The south bank of the mouth of the River Tees has the 62-megawatt Teesside Offshore Wind Farm, built 2011–13.

Near the mouth of the River Tees is the large dry dock facility of ABLE UK, named TERRC (Teesside Environmental Reclamation and Recycling Centre), used to dismantle or oil rigs and other large vessels. Hartlepool Nuclear Power Station is adjacent to the east.

== 2021 North-East England shellfish die-off ==

In early October 2021 thousands of dead crabs and lobsters were washed up on the Tees estuary and beaches along the North-East coast of England. The deaths were first reported in Seaton Carew, Redcar and Seaham. A 95% decline in the lobster and crab catch was noticed by those employed in the local fishing industry. A spokesperson for the UK Environment Agency said, &quot;Samples of water, sediment, mussel and crab have been collected and are being sent to our labs for analysis to consider whether a pollution incident could have contributed to the deaths of the animals.&quot; The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) labs were also testing crustaceans for disease. There is no evidence of any link to recent strandings of marine mammals and seabirds across the UK and countries along the North Sea coast, according to the EA.

By late November the crustacean die-off had spread as far south as Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay and was affecting catches in Whitby. The Environment Agency has ruled out chemical pollution as the cause of the mass shellfish deaths. Dredging was also rejected as the cause of the environmental disaster. Environment Agency operations manager Sarah Jennings said, &quot;We&#x27;ve used both traditional and innovative screening methods to analyse samples of water, sediment and crab looking for traces of contamination. We’ve screened for over 1,000 potential chemical contaminants but found no anomalies that could lead to an event of this scale.&quot;

In early February 2022 it was reported that, &quot;Defra and partner agencies have completed a thorough investigation of the cause of dead crabs and lobsters which were found washed up on the North East coast between October and December 2021. Following significant testing and modelling to rule out possible causes, Defra and partner agencies consider that the deaths of the crabs and lobsters potentially resulted from a naturally occurring harmful algal bloom.&quot; In June 2022 George Monbiot wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Astonishingly, although there is no evidence that it conducted such sampling, the government concluded not only that a bloom had occurred, but that it was caused by a particular, toxic species: &quot;Karenia mikimotoi&quot;. This is the stuff of science fiction. &quot;Karenia&quot; thrives in temperatures between . The average water temperature on this coast in October is . There is no plausible mechanism by which a &quot;Karenia&quot; bloom could cause the mass death of lobsters and crabs without also killing large numbers of fish, sea urchins and many other species.&quot; Monbiot reported that when he asked the UK government to publish its evidence the government refused.

==Legends and folklore==
Peg Powler is a hag in English folklore who is said to inhabit the River Tees.

==In popular culture==
The River Tees was featured in the television series &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of the North, and in the post-apocalyptic drama &quot;The Last Train&quot; having blown its banks.

<text>Enanitos Verdes ( &quot;Little green dwarfs&quot;, roughly equivalent to the English phrase &quot;Little green men&quot;) is an Argentine rock band formed in 1979 in Mendoza.

== History ==
The band started in 1979, with Marciano Cantero (bass, keyboards, vocals), Felipe Staiti (guitar) and Daniel Piccolo (drums). That same year, they performed throughout the Cuyo region. Later they traveled to Buenos Aires to record a demo, which was never released.

In 1984, the band added two new members: Sergio Embrioni (guitar and vocals) and Tito Dávila (keyboard). As a quintet, they recorded their first album &quot;Los Enanitos Verdes&quot;, with the hit &quot;Aún sigo cantando&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m still singing&quot;). Embrioni left the band in 1985.

In 1986, they released their second album, entitled &quot;Contrarreloj&quot; (&quot;Counterclockwise&quot;), with the production of Andrés Calamaro. The album included songs such as &quot;Tus viejas cartas&quot; (&quot;Your old letters&quot;), &quot;Cada vez que digo adiós&quot; (&quot;Every time I say goodbye&quot;), and &quot;La muralla verde&quot; (&quot;The green wall&quot;). Their third album &quot;Habitaciones extrañas&quot; (&quot;Strange Rooms&quot;) would arrive the following year. Produced again by Calamaro, it included &quot;Te vi en un tren&quot; (&quot;I saw you in a train&quot;), &quot;Por el resto&quot; (&quot;For the Rest&quot;) and &quot;El extraño de pelo largo&quot; (&quot;The stranger with the long hair&quot;).

In 1988, they did an extensive tour, alongside Miguel Mateos/Zas and Soda Stereo. Over six months, three of their concerts: Viña del Mar (50,000 spectators), Mendoza, Argentina (35,000) and Santiago, Chile (32,000), were attended by more than 30,000 spectators. In that same year, they released their LP, &quot;Carrousel&quot;. The song &quot;Guitarras blancas&quot; (White guitars) became one of their biggest hits off the LP. A year later, the group broke up, with Marciano Cantero starting his solo career. In 1992, the group got back together, without Dávila, recording the album &quot;Igual que ayer&quot; (&quot;Same as Yesterday&quot;).

In 1994, they released the album &quot;Big Bang&quot; on the record label EMI Latin. The album became a huge international success and includes their biggest hit, &quot;Lamento Boliviano&quot;. The album also contains the song &quot;Mejor No Hablemos de Amor&quot; (Better Not Talk About Love) and the power ballad &quot;Mi Primer Día Sin Ti&quot; (&quot;My First Day Without You&quot;).

In 1998, they released their album &quot;Tracción acústica&quot;, with the US record company Polygram. This album made them the first Argentine group and third Argentine artist to sign with a US company. This album was nominated for the Grammies in the category &quot;Best Latin Rock Album&quot;.

They were part of the Watcha Tour 2000, which included seventeen shows along with Molotov, Aterciopelados, Café Tacuba and A.N.I.M.A.L.

In 2003, they went on tour with Alejandra Guzmán. They have, among other awards, earned a &quot;Gaviota de Plata&quot; (&quot;Silver Gull&quot;) at the &quot;Festival de Viña del Mar&quot; in Chile. That same year, they recorded their album &quot;Amores Lejanos&quot; with the hit single &quot;Amores Lejanos&quot;.

In 2009, drummer Daniel Piccolo left the band. Jota Morelli from Fito Paez&#x27;s band replaced him.

Former guitarist Sergio Embrioni committed suicide on 17 February 2011.

The band went on tour in 2018 with Spanish group Hombres G across the United States.

On 8 September 2022, Marciano Cantero, the songwriter and frontman of Enanitos Verdes, died in the afternoon following a renal surgical procedure in a private hospital in his hometown of Mendoza. He was 62. The band briefly suspended activities before resuming touring in December

In 2023, the band announced a series of tour dates and added bassist Guillermo Vadalá, keyboardist Bosco Aguilar, and backing vocalists Arita Rodriguez and Damian Castroviejo in place of Cantero

<doc id="191678" wikidata="Q11118328" url="?curid=191678" title="Meetings with Remarkable Men">
<text>Meetings with Remarkable Men, autobiographical in nature, is the second volume of the &quot;All and Everything&quot; trilogy written by the Greek-Armenian spiritual teacher G. I. Gurdjieff. Gurdjieff started working on the Russian manuscript in 1927, revising it several times over the coming years. An English translation by A. R. Orage was first published in 1963.

==Overview==
The book takes the form of Gurdjieff&#x27;s reminiscences about various &quot;remarkable men&quot; that he met, beginning with his father. They include the Armenian priest Pogossian; his friend Soloviev, and Prince Lubovedsky, a Russian prince with metaphysical interests.

In the course of describing these characters, Gurdjieff weaves their stories into the story of his own travels, and also into an overarching narrative which has them cooperate in locating spiritual texts and/or masters in various lands (mostly Central Asia). Gurdjieff calls this group the &quot;Seekers of Truth&quot;.

Most of them do in fact find truth in the form of some suitable spiritual destiny. The underlying philosophy, especially as articulated in an appendix, amounts to the assertion that people generally live their lives asleep, are unconscious of themselves and, accordingly, behave like machines subject to outside causes and pressures. Also, one of the chief assessments of the novel is that the people of the past epochs lived in more suitable outer conditions and at higher inner levels than the people today. Many additional hidden harmonies are noted or alluded to.

Claims that seem to contradict modern beliefs have inspired some to question the book&#x27;s &quot;autobiographical&quot; character. For example, Gurdjieff claims to have first heard the Epic of Gilgamesh as an oral epic sung from memory by his father; to have made contact with various ancient brotherhoods including the Sarmoung Brotherhood; to have copied a map of &quot;pre-sand Egypt&quot;; and to have witnessed a number of miracles and esoteric phenomena. However, it has since been accepted that North Africa goes through a 21,000 year climate cycle that would have produced a &quot;pre-sand Egypt&quot; during the period from approximately 9,000 to 3,500 BCE.

It may be argued that many of the vignettes in &quot;Meetings&quot; are meant to be symbolic, or &quot;teaching stories&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted into a film, &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot;, in 1979 by Peter Brook.

<doc id="191680" wikidata="Q4879862" url="?curid=191680" title="Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson">
<text>Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson or An Objectively Impartial Criticism of the Life of Man is the first volume of the &quot;All and Everything&quot; trilogy written by the Greek-Armenian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff. The All and Everything trilogy also includes &quot;Meetings with Remarkable Men&quot; (first published in 1963) and &quot;Life Is Real Only Then, When &#x27;I Am&#x27;&quot; (first privately printed in 1974).

==Purpose and significance==
The book was intended to be the main study tool for Gurdjieff&#x27;s Fourth Way teachings. As Gurdjieff&#x27;s idea of &quot;work&quot; is central to those teachings, Gurdjieff went to great lengths in order to increase the effort needed to read and understand it. Gurdjieff himself once said, “I bury the bone so deep that the dogs have to scratch for it.&quot; The book covers many topics. It is an allegory and myth in a literary form all its own.

In his prospectus for &quot;All and Everything&quot;, printed at the beginning of each part of the trilogy, Gurdjieff states his aim in the first volume of &quot;destroy[ing], mercilessly, without any compromises whatsoever, in the mentation and feelings of the reader, the beliefs and views, by centuries rooted in him, about everything existing in the world.&quot;

&quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; is included in Martin Seymour-Smith&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential Books Ever Written&quot;, with the comment that it is &quot;...the most convincing fusion of Eastern and Western thought [that] has yet been seen.&quot;

==Background==
===Author===
Gurdjieff was most notable for introducing the Fourth Way. He claimed that the Eastern teachings brought by him to the West expressed the truth found in other ancient religions and wisdom teachings relating to self-awareness in one&#x27;s daily life and humanity&#x27;s place and role in the universe. It might be summed up by the title of his third series of writings: &quot;Life Is Real Only Then, When &#x27;I Am&#x27;&quot;, while his complete series of books is entitled &quot;All and Everything&quot;.

===Composition===

After Gurdjieff was in a serious car accident in 1924, he decided to pass on something of his theoretical teachings by writing a number of detailed books. After many writings and rewritings, the first volume was released under the title &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot;. Gurdjieff first mainly dictated &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; in Russian and Armenian between 1924 and 1927, as he was initially unable to write personally because of his condition after the accident. After realizing from the various public readings of his texts that those people who were not familiar with his form of mentation and expression would not be able to understand anything, he decided to completely rewrite everything.

Details of Gurdjieff&#x27;s other activities while writing the book can be found in his third book &quot;Life Is Real Only Then, When &#x27;I Am&#x27;&quot;.

===Readings===
Gurdjieff often held various readings of his texts to both his students and strangers. William Buehler Seabrook noted that Gurdjieff asked him to invite some of his friends to Gurdjieff&#x27;s apartment, where Gurdjieff gave a reading from the manuscript of &quot;Beelezbub&#x27;s Tales&quot;. The listeners (including the behaviorist John Watson, Lincoln Steffens, and George Seldes) were apparently perplexed and unimpressed.

== Content ==
&quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot; uses the framing device of the musings of an extraterrestrial known as Beelzebub (who shares a name with the demon of the same name) to his grandson Hassein, as they travel through space towards Beelzebub&#x27;s home planet, Karatas, on the spaceship &quot;Karnak&quot;. Beelzebub recounts his adventures and travails amongst the &quot;three-brained beings&quot; (humans) of the planet Earth. Beelzebub details the history, customs and psychology of humanity and relates the esoteric theory behind the workings of the universe.

Beelzebub narrates a history of creation that allegorically explains the human condition as perceived by Gurdjieff: Earth is described as being orbited by two satellites which broke off the planet during its early phase after it was hit by a comet: the Moon and a second body (unknown to mankind) called &quot;Anulios&quot;. In order to maintain cosmic stability it was necessary that both bodies remain in Earth&#x27;s orbit. To ensure this stability, men were required to emit a certain substance. An artificial organ was implanted into all human beings by the &quot;high powers&quot; making them oblivious of this mechanism but causing psychological side effects such as vanity, pride, and other vices: 

That organ was later removed but the side effects remained: 
The protagonist then reports his visits to Earth and the gained insights about humanity. This narration is interrupted by embedded explanations of the author&#x27;s philosophical world view.

==Publications==
===Original English version===
&quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot; was first published in 1950 by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company and Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. This first translation was made, under the personal direction of the author, by a group of translators chosen by him and &quot;specially trained according to their defined individualities.&quot; It was republished in 1964 by E.P. Dutton &amp; Co, in 1973 by E.P. Dutton &amp; Co (in paperback in three volumes), and in 1993 by Two Rivers Press. It was republished in 1999 by Penguin Arkana in paperback. The 1999 edition contained corrections of errata and the insertion of two paragraphs omitted from page 568 of Chapter 32 &quot;Hypnotism&quot; in earlier editions.

===Revised translation===
A revised translation of &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot; was published in 1992 by Arkana, an imprint of Viking Penguin. A number of Gurdjieff&#x27;s follower objected. The revision was begun on the initiative of Jeanne de Salzmann. The translation team included members of the Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, the Gurdjieff Society (London) and the Institut Gurdjieff (Paris), as well as Triangle Editions, the holder of the copyright to both texts. The latter edition was regarded by some of Gurdjieff&#x27;s followers, outside of the membership of the International Gurdjieff Foundations, as &quot;a major degeneration that showed disregard of Gurdjieff&#x27;s work.&quot; The introduction to the revised edition states that the 1950 edition, overseen by Orage, who did not know Russian and was unable to read Gurdjieff&#x27;s original text, produced, &quot;in many passages an awkward result.&quot; The introduction states that before Gurdjieff&#x27;s death in 1949, he entrusted the book and his other writings to Jeanne de Salzmann, his closest pupil, with instructions for future publication. De Salzmann had followed Gurdjieff for more than thirty years and played a central role in his decision in the 1940s to organize the practice of his teaching. As for the first edition, Gurdjieff had called the translation a &quot;rough diamond,&quot; and had asked De Salzmann to revise it at a later time.

Opponents of this view, such as John Henderson, claim that Orage had worked closely with Gurdjieff to produce the original English translation.

They point out that the revision resulted in changes to nearly every paragraph, and included substantial changes to both content and presentation. Following are three short representative examples taken from a digital comparison between the 1950 and 1992 versions.

Ordinary text indicates passages that are present in both the original and revised versions. Struck out text indicates passages that were in the original but not in the revision. Underlined text indicates passages that are in the revision but not in the original. Page numbers refer to the 1999 reprint of the 1950 version.

* &quot;The flow of forces follows a line that constantly deflects at specific intervals and unites again at its ends.&quot;

==The intent of the book==
Gurdjieff said that he had answered every question that could possibly arise in a person&#x27;s mind and advised readers to read his work once, &quot;for the welfare or the peace of the souls of one&#x27;s parents&quot;, then &quot;for the welfare of one&#x27;s neighbor&quot; and a third time &quot;for oneself personally&quot;.

Although not indicated in the text, it appears that ever since it was written, &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales to His Grandson&quot; was intended not to be intensely studied alone, but to have various pieces of understanding conveyed to the reader through oral tradition to enable a much greater degree of understanding as to what is being written about.

==Characters==
=== Main characters ===
Beelzebub relates his past experiences in a solar system called Ors (our solar system) where he had been banished for rebelling against His Endlessness. He spent his exile in observation of the solar system, and of Earth and humans in particular. He visited Earth six times and observed it from just after its creation until 1922. Because of his help in the eradication of animal sacrifice on Earth, Beelzebub was pardoned from his sentence.

Beelzebub tells the tales to his grandson Hassein while they are traveling together on the spaceship Karnak for his conference on another planet, shortly after his return from the exile. He took Hassein with him so he could use his free time during this journey for the purpose of giving a proper education to his grandson. Hassein listens to his grandfather&#x27;s stories patiently, and with admiration. Ahoon is a devoted old servant of Beelzebub who accompanies him and Hassein throughout the space journey.

The name &quot;Beelzebub&quot; is a derogatory Hebrew renaming of the pre-Judaic Canaanite god Baal, meaning literally &quot;Lord House-fly&quot; (Baal-zevuv) (monotheistic Jewish reference to Baal was almost certainly pejorative, and grew to be used among other terms for Satan. The name later appears as the name of a demon or devil, often interchanged with Beelzebul), while the name &quot;Hassein&quot; has the same linguistic root with &quot;Husayn&quot; (). Sigmund Freud theorized Judaism and Christianity as expressing a relationship between father (Judaism) and son (Christianity). In this light, Gurdjieff&#x27;s choice of grandfather and grandson suggests a pre-Judaic and post-Christian relationship.

The spaceship Karnak derives its name from a famous temple in Egypt, located on the banks of the River Nile. When humans are liberated enough to ascend through the ancient knowledge, they could travel through the universe, hence the temple&#x27;s name for the spaceship.

=== Other major characters ===

=== Minor characters and historical figures mentioned ===
Leonardo da Vinci, Pythagoras, Alexander of Macedonia, Menitkel (a &quot;learned being&quot; original to the work), Charles Darwin, Ignatius, Franz Mesmer, Dmitri Mendeleev, various angels, various Archangels

===Neologoisms===
In the text, Gurdjieff invented many words and terms, such as &quot;Triamazikamno&quot; – law of three, &quot;Heptaparaparshinokh&quot; – law of sevenfoldness, &quot;Solioonensius&quot; – certain cosmic law, and so on. Whether Gurdjieff invented these words, or applied certain concepts to them is unclear. Many of these words have roots in modern languages, while others have roots in ancient languages. Another possibility is noted in &quot;Life Is Real Only Then, When &#x27;I Am&#x27;&quot;, where Gurdjieff wrote that he accidentally learned of the word &quot;Solioonensius&quot; from a Dervish.

Gurdjieff applied these words to minor concepts, as well as some major ones. One of the major concepts is where Gurdjieff applies the word &quot;Hasnamuss&quot; to certain types of people. According to &quot;Beelzebub&#x27;s Tales&quot;, Hasnamuss is a being who acquires &quot;something&quot; which creates certain harmful factors for himself, as well as for those around him. According to Gurdjieff this applies to &quot;average people&quot; as well as to those who are on &quot;higher levels&quot;.

This &quot;something&quot; is formed in beings as a result of the following manifestations:

# Every kind of depravity, conscious as well as unconscious
# The feeling of self-satisfaction from leading others astray
# The irresistible inclination to destroy the existence of other breathing creatures
# The urge to become free from the necessity of actualizing the being-efforts demanded by nature
# The attempt by every kind to artificially conceal from others what in their opinion are one&#x27;s physical defects
# The calm self-contentment in the use of what is not personally deserved
# The striving to be not what one is

==Inpenetrability of the text==

Gurdjieff went to great lengths to add layer upon layer of complexity to the, at times, dry, long-winded, or absurd text, As noted, he also added a number of long words and phrases which appear often throughout the text. The definition of those words are often given later on in the text, which functionally necessitates more than one reading of the text. He believed that knowledge which comes without any effort from the student is useless. He believed that true knowledge comes from personal experiences and individual confrontations actualized by one&#x27;s own intentions.

The first chapter, entitled &quot;The Arousing of Thought&quot; (more of a preface or introduction) was edited or rewritten by Gurdjieff thirty times. Gurdjieff would expound one of the book&#x27;s most controversial ideas in an early chapter entitled &quot;The Arch-absurd: According to the assertion of Beelzebub, our Sun neither lights or heats&quot;.

One of Gurdjieff&#x27;s chief criticisms of modern society, expressed quite clearly even to the casual reader in this particular volume, is the inexactitude of modern language.

The complexity and the length of this book has limited the readers to those with strong interest in Gurdjieff&#x27;s ideas. This has significantly limited criticism and discussion of it.

<doc id="191681" wikidata="Q880229" url="?curid=191681" title="Black Dyke Band">
<text>Black Dyke Band, formerly John Foster &amp; Son Black Dyke Mills Band, is one of the oldest and most well-known brass bands in the world. It originated as multiple community bands founded by John Foster at his family&#x27;s textile mill in Queensbury, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, in the mid-19th century. The ensemble has become prominent in competitive band championships and through recordings for film and television.

The band is well-known for recording the soundtrack to the BBC gardening makeover series &quot;Ground Force&quot; in 1997, and appeared in the Christmas edition of Victoria Wood&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Dinnerladies&quot; in 1999. In 1998, they played on the Academy Award-nominated song &quot;That&#x27;ll Do&quot; from &quot;&quot;. They have featured on recordings and live appearances by acts including the Beatles, Paul McCartney and Tori Amos. In 2014, the band won the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain for a record 23rd time, and the British Open Championship for another record 30th time. They have also won the European Championships a record thirteen times, most recently in 2015.

==History==

The band was formerly the band of the Black Dyke Mills in Queensbury, Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, a company owned by John Foster. Foster, a French horn player, joined with others in a small brass and reed band in Queensbury in 1816. This band faltered, and another band formed – called the Queenshead Band – which consisted of 18 musicians around 1843. This second band also faltered, but in 1855, Foster and other musicians established the new mill band, and outfitted it with uniforms made from the mill&#x27;s own cloth. Most of the musicians in the band also worked at the mill, and a close bond was fostered with the local community. The band has remained active since that time, and still rehearses in its original rooms.

Black Dyke was the first band to achieve the &quot;Grand Slam&quot; in 1985 by winning the Yorkshire regional, European, British Open and National Championship contests. They were also voted BBC Band of the Year.

They appeared in an episode of Victoria Wood&#x27;s &quot;dinnerladies&quot; sitcom in 1999.

== European Championships == 
==Recordings==
Black Dyke Band has made over 350 recordings, including one of the first brass band recordings in 1904 and classical music. It has recorded with classical bass trombonist Douglas Yeo, and pop acts Tori Amos, Peter Gabriel and The Beautiful South. The band also worked with Gabriel on the highly acclaimed Millennium Show, featured in the Millennium Dome, as well as recording the music for the BBC programme &quot;Ground Force&quot;.

In September 1968, the band released a single on The Beatles’ Apple Records label. The A-side was an instrumental composed by Lennon–McCartney called &quot;Thingumybob&quot; (the theme to a London Weekend Television sitcom of the same name starring Stanley Holloway). The flipside was a brass band instrumental version of another Lennon–McCartney song, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. The single was released under the name John Foster &amp; Son Ltd Black Dyke Mills Band, produced by McCartney, and was one of the first four singles issued on the Apple label. In 1979, the Black Dyke Mills Band worked again with McCartney on a track for the Wings album &quot;Back to the Egg&quot;. 

In August 2009, the band undertook a tour of Australia with multi-instrumentalist James Morrison which culminated in a concert at the Sydney Opera House.

==Members== 
As of 2020, the principals of the band&#x27;s line up included:
* Soprano cornet: Connor Lennon

The band&#x27;s current principal conductor and director of music is the Welsh euphonium virtuoso Prof. Nicholas Childs. His predecessor was trumpet player James Watson.

Paul Lovatt-Cooper was the band&#x27;s &#x27;composer in association&#x27; and former principal percussionist. He retired from playing in early 2011 in order to concentrate on his teaching, conducting and composition.

Black Dyke Band is the brass band in residence at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and Childs also conducts the RNCM Brass Band.

<text>The European School, Culham (ESC) was one of the fourteen European Schools and the only one in the United Kingdom. Located in Culham near Abingdon in Oxfordshire. It was founded in 1978 for the purpose of providing an education to the children of staff working for the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom).

==History==
The European School, Culham was founded in 1978 for the purpose of providing an education to the children of staff working for the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) on the Joint European Torus (JET) fusion energy research programme based nearby, and later, additionally, children of staff seconded as part of the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA).

With the relocation of European Union-seconded researchers and their families following the formation of JET&#x27;s successor in France, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), and the formation of EFDA&#x27;s successor, EUROfusion, to support ITER&#x27;s development, it was announced that the school would close on 31 August 2017. The school confirmed that this was a move unrelated to Brexit. The final two employees, the bursar and accountant, continued to work until 31 May 2018.

The former ESC campus was subsumed by the Europa School UK on 1 September 2017. ESUK is a &#x27;free school&#x27; and an Accredited European School with all students following a learning programme leading to the European Baccalaureate qualification. Accredited European Schools are schools under national jurisdiction within European Union (EU) member states which, without forming part of the intergovernmental network of European Schools, offer its multilingual curriculum and the European Baccalaureate.

== Notable alumni ==
* Henry Brett, England polo player
* Tommaso Allan, Italian rugby union player
* Pablo Martinez (Welsh footballer), professional football player

== Notable former staff ==
* Tom Høyem, school Director (1987-1994)
* Marcus Stock, former teacher of Religious Education.
* Colin Hannaford, former mathematics teacher.

<text>The Culdees (; ) were members of ascetic Christian monastic and eremitical communities of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England in the Middle Ages. Appearing first in Ireland and then in Scotland, subsequently attached to cathedral or collegiate churches; they lived in monastic fashion though not taking monastic vows.

==Etymology==
According to the Swiss theologian Philip Schaff, the term Culdee or Ceile De, or Kaledei, first appeared in the 8th century. While &quot;giving rise to much controversy and untenable theories&quot;, it probably means servants or worshippers of God. The term was applied to anchorites, who, in entire seclusion from society, sought the perfection of sanctity through their values of poverty, charity, self-denial and perseverance. They afterward associated themselves into communities of hermits and were finally brought under canonical rule along with the secular clergy. It was at the time the name Culdee became almost synonymous with secular canon.

According to François Bonifas, however, the Culdean Church was founded in the 2nd century and restored by Saint Patrick in Ireland in the 5th century.

==History==
===Ireland===
In the course of the 9th century, nine places in Ireland are mentioned (including Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Clones, Devenish and Sligo) where communities of Culdees were established.

Óengus the Culdee lived in the last quarter of the 8th century and is best known as the author of the &quot;Félire Óengusso&quot;, &quot;the Martyrology of Óengus&quot;. He founded Dísert Óengusa near Croom in AD 780. Maelruan, under whom Oengus lived, drew up a rule for the Culdees of Tallaght that prescribed their prayers, fasts, devotions, confession, and penances, but there is no evidence that this rule was widely accepted even in the other Culdean establishments. Fedelmid mac Crimthainn king of Munster (820–846) was said to have been a prominent Culdee.

According to William Reeves, they were analogous to secular canons and held an intermediate position between the monastic and parochial clergy. In Armagh, they were presided over by a Prior and numbered about twelve. They were the officiating clergy of the churches and became the standing ministers of the cathedral. The maintenance of divine service, and in particular, the practice of choral worship, seems to have been their special function and made them an important element of the cathedral economy.

However, after the death of Maelruan in 792, Tallaght is forgotten, and the name Ceile-De disappears from the Irish annals until 919, when the Four Masters record that Armagh was plundered by the Danes but that the houses of prayer, &quot;with the people of God, that is Ceile-De&quot;, were spared. Subsequent entries in the annals show that there were Culdees at Clondalkin, at Monahincha in Tipperary, and at Scattery Island.

The Danish wars affected the Culdee houses. Clondalkin and Clones disappeared altogether. At Clonmacnoise, as early as the eleventh century, the Culdees were laymen and married, while those at Monahincha and Scattery Island, being utterly corrupt and unable, or unwilling, to reform, gave way to the regular canons. At Armagh, regular canons were introduced into the cathedral church in the twelfth century and took precedence over the Culdees, six in number, a prior and five vicars. These still continued a corporate existence, charged with the celebration of the Divine offices and the care of the church building: they had separate lands and sometimes charge of parishes. When a chapter was formed, about 1160, the prior usually filled the office of precentor, his brethren being vicars choral, and himself ranking in the chapter next to the chancellor. He was elected by his brother Culdees and confirmed by the primate, and had a voice in the election of the archbishop by virtue of his position in the chapter.

As Ulster was the last of the Irish provinces to be brought effectually under English rule the Armagh Culdees long outlived their brethren throughout Ireland. The Culdees of Armagh endured until the dissolution in 1541 and enjoyed a fleeting resurrection in 1627, soon after which their ancient property passed to the vicars choral of the cathedral.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, Culdees were more numerous than in Ireland: thirteen monastic establishments were peopled by them, eight in connection with cathedrals. The Ionan monks had been expelled by the Pictish king Nechtan son of Derile in 717. There is no mention of any Culdees at any Columban monastery, either in Ireland or in Scotland, until long after Columba&#x27;s time: in 1164 that Culdees are mentioned as being in Iona but in a subordinate position. The Culdee of Loch Leven lived on St Serf&#x27;s Inch, which had been given them by a Pictish prince, Brude, about 700. In 1093, they surrendered their island to the bishop of St Andrews in return for perpetual food and clothing but Robert, the bishop in 1144, handed over all their vestments, books, and other property, with the island, to the newly founded Canons Regular, in which the Culdees were likely incorporated.

The Culdee chapel in St Andrews in Fife can be seen to the north-east of its ruined cathedral and city wall. It is dedicated to &quot;St Mary on the Rock&quot; and is cruciform. It is used by the local St Andrews churches for their Easter morning service. In the early days there were several Culdee establishments in Fife, probably small rude structures accommodating 30 or 40 worshippers, and possibly such a structure stood at or near the present church. In 1075 AD, the foundation charter of Dunfermline Church was granted by King Malcolm III, and amongst the possessions, he bestowed on the church was the Shire of Kirkcaladinit, as Kirkcaldy was then known. Crínán of Dunkeld, the grandfather of Máel Coluim III, was a lay abbot, and tradition says that even the clerical members were married, though unlike the priests of the Eastern Orthodox Church, they lived apart from their wives during their term of sacerdotal service.

The pictures that we have of Culdee life in the 12th century vary considerably. The chief houses in Scotland were at St Andrews, Scone, Dunkeld, Lochleven, Monymusk in Aberdeenshire, Abernethy and Brechin. Each was an independent establishment controlled entirely by its own abbot and apparently divided into two sections, one priestly and the other lay. Culdee priests were allowed to marry. At St Andrews about the year 1100, there were thirteen Culdees holding office by hereditary tenure, some apparently paying more regard to their own prosperity than to the services of the church or the needs of the populace. At Loch Leven, there is no trace of such partial independence.

Nineteenth Century Scottish historian of religion and Presbyterian minister James Aitken Wylie asserted in his &quot;History of the Scottish Nation&quot;, Vol. III., &quot;The 12th century, particularly in Scotland and Brittany, was a time when two Christian faiths of different origins were contending for possession of the land, the Roman Church and the old Celtic Rite. The age was a sort of borderland between Culdeeism and Romanism. The two met and mingled often in the same monastery, and the religious belief of the nation was a mumble of superstitious doctrines and a few scriptural truths&quot;.

A controversial movement to put Scotland&#x27;s church under the authority of Rome was inaugurated by Malcolm III&#x27;s wife, Queen Margaret and carried through by her sons Alexander I and David I. Gradually the whole position passed into the hands of Thurgot and his successors in the bishopric. Canons Regular were instituted and some of the Culdees joined the Roman Catholic church. Those who declined were allowed a life-rent of their revenues and lingered on as a separate but ever-dwindling body till the beginning of the 14th century when excluded from voting at the election of the bishop, they disappear from history. In the same fashion the Culdee of Monymusk, originally perhaps a colony from St Andrews, became Canons Regular of the Augustinian order early in the 13th century, and those of Abernethy in 1273. At Brechin, famous like Abernethy for its round tower, the Culdee prior and his monks helped to form the chapter of the diocese founded by David I in 1145, though the name persisted for a generation or two.

By the end of the thirteenth century, most Scots Culdee houses had disappeared. Some, like Dunkeld and Abernethy, were superseded by regular canons: others, like Brechin and Dunblane, were extinguished with the introduction of cathedral chapters. One at least, Monifieth, passed into the hands of laymen. At St Andrews, they lived on side by side with the regular canons and still clung to their ancient privilege of electing the archbishop. But their claim was disallowed at Rome, and in 1273 they were debarred even from voting. They continued to be mentioned up until 1332 in the records of St Andrews, where they &quot;formed a small college of highly-placed secular clerks closely connected with the bishop and the king&quot;.

===England===
Similar absorptions no doubt account for the disappearance of the Culdees of York, the only English establishment that uses the name, borne by the canons of St Peter&#x27;s about 925 where they performed in the tenth century the double duty of officiating in the cathedral church and of relieving the sick and poor. When a new cathedral arose under a Norman archbishop, they ceased their connection with the cathedral, but, helped by donations, continued to relieve the destitute. The date at which they finally disappeared is unknown. These seem to be the only cases where the term &quot;Culdee&quot; is found in England.

===Wales===
The term &quot;Culdee&quot; is rarely found in Wales. We do not know the fate of the Culdean house that existed at Snowdon and Bardsey Island in north Wales in the days of Giraldus Cambrensis, mentioned (c. 1190) in &quot;Speculum Ecclesiae&quot; and &quot;Itinerarium&quot; respectively. The former community was, he says, sorely oppressed by the covetous Cistercians.

==Origin==
Hector Boece in his &quot;Latin history of Scotland&quot; (1516), makes the Culdees of the 9th to the 12th century the direct successors of the Irish and Ionan monasticism of the 6th to the 8th century. Some have suggested that these views were disproved by William Reeves (1815–1892), bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore. James A. Wylie (1808–1890) makes a strong case that the Culdees (Keledei) of Scotland are related to the Celtic Christian Pelagian spirituality of the monks of Iona.

Reeves suggests that Maelruan may have been aware of the establishment of canons in Metz by Archbishop Chrodegang, (died 766), as an intermediate class between monks and secular priests, adopting the discipline of the monastic system, without the vows, and discharging the offices of ministers in various churches.

===Early Culdee Sites===

==Tallaght Abbey (Mainistir Tamhlacht)==
Tallaght Abbey became the mother house of the Culdee (Céile Dé) movement. Tallaght or Tamlacht in Irish means &#x27;burial ground&#x27;, it was a pagan plague-burial ground that was connected with the people of Parthalón. It was such an important institution that it and the monastery at Finglas were known as the &quot;two eyes of Ireland&quot;. Saint Máel Ruain was founder and abbot-bishop of the monastery of Tallaght (Co. Dublin, Ireland). He had been a disciple of Óengus the Culdee, a son of a Óengobann, a king of Dál nAraidi. The monastery produced a comprehensive martyrology of Irish Culdee Saints and some non-Irish Saints ina manuscript known as the Félire Óengusso Céli Dé in Tallaght Monastery. Today St. Maelruain&#x27;s stands on the grounds the original monastery once stood. Máel Ruain and Óengus were said to have been the authors of a text, which sets out the rule of the Céilí Dé monks. One of the earliest Celtic Rite books, the Stowe Missal was completed in Tallaght Monastery, not long after the death of Saint Máel Ruain and then carried by an anchorite called Máel Dithruib to the monasteries at Terryglass and Lorrha. Saint Máel Ruain was known to be a Anam Cara to this same abbot, Máel Dithruib of Terryglass. The abecedarian hymn of &quot;Archangelum mirum magnum&quot; is attributed to Mael Ruain. The Hiberno-Latin hymn is in praise of St. Michael, whose name is associated with the founding of the Tallaght Monastery, a copy of the song is found in Karlsruhe, Badische Landesbibliothek.

===Other Culdee monasteries and saints===

====Armagh (Ard Mhacha)====
Some of the locations of the earliest Culdee churches were sited near or on top of what used to be important Pre-Christian sites. In Ireland, a notable example is when Saint Patrick choose to build his first stone church in Ireland, he decided to build it as close as possible to the Ancient Druidic site of Emain Macha. The oldest of the two Cathedrals in Armagh is located on a steep sided hill which Queen Macha allegedly had chosen as a defence of the ancient Fortress at Emain Macha in Pre-Christian times.

====Blathmac====
The find in 1953 of the old Irish poems of Blathmac, constituted the largest ever addition of text to the corpus of Early Irish, some parts of it also still remain untranslated and unpublished due to its poor condition. They were discovered among a collection of ancient seventeenth century manuscripts, which had once belonged to the Brehon and scribe Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, it was found by a twentieth century Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies scholar, Nessa Ní Shéaghdha. The poems were edited and published eleven years later by James Carney in Vol. 47 of the Irish Texts Society monographs. They date back to the 8th century, possibly earlier and consisted of detailed references to the importance Christ and to the Virgin Mary. Carney had suggested that Blathmac may have originally come from filí and druidic background but later been a convert to become part of the Culdee Reform movement through a detailed study of the structure of his poetry, which resembled in style to the Félire Óengusso.

====Clonmacnoise (Cluain Mhic Nóis)====
An important Culdee monastery was Clonmacnoise: the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; mention Conn na mbocht (Conn of the Paupers), who was head of the Culdees and Bishop of Clonmacnoise. Much of the information of Pagan or Pre-Christian Ireland was transferred into text by monks and scholars for the first time at Clonmacnoise from what had previously been Orally passed down generations. With the arrival of the Christian age, the Martyrology of Oengus highlighted the growing emergence of the religious power of Clonmacnoise in contrast at that time to the diminishing importance of the Pre-Christian site of the Cruachan. The Rathcroghan Pagan tale of the Táin Bó Cúailnge was first written down by Celtic Monks at Clonmacnoise, Lebor na hUidre also has references to the Pre-Christian site of Cruachan, one of the key scribes was Máel Muire mac Céilechair. Other manuscripts originating or connected with Clonmacnoise include, Chronicon Scotorum, Book of Lecan and Annals of Tigernach.

In the Book of Lecan it describes a particular story of the last Pagan King in Ireland Diarmait mac Cerbaill and details about his subsequent death. There was a prophecy by the Kings druid Bec mac Dé, who told of a threefold death he uttered on the day of his death, when he meet Colum Cille. Diarmait mac Cerbaill was murdered by the then king of Cruthin, Áed Dub mac Suibni. According to some early texts Irish kings Diarmait mac Cerbaill and Muirchertach mac Ercae may have both died a threefold death on Samhain, which may be linked to human sacrifice, similar to the dead victims discovered in Irish bogs, it was a ritual in ancient Ireland to sacrifice a king or someone of high status around the time of Samhain, which according to &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; it is an ancient tradition that goes back to the worship of Crom Cruach, a Celtic god associated with the harvest, Samhain and he is also associated to the headless horse man or Dullahan, as part of the Sídhe in Irish Mythology.

Soon after Diarmait&#x27;s death Áed fled to the island of Tiree, where it was said he trained to be a Culdee priest, much to the disgust of both Columba and Adomnán. Columba himself on hearing the news had prophesied by means of a curse that a threefold death would happen to the bloody murderer Áed Dub mac Suibni.

====Devenish Island (Damh Inis)====
A Culdee (Céilí Dé) community on Devenish Island, Lough Erne in Fermanagh was founded by Saint Molaise, it consisted of an oratory and Round tower. The Devenish Island carried on the Pre-Christian tradition of Stone Carved heads structures that existed on the Pagan Boa Island also on Lough Erne, the lake itself bursts with legend, with its own banshee and ghosts. According to much older pre-Christian folklore the first ever settlement on the Island was said to have been established by Ollamh Fodhla.

====St. Seachnall&#x27;s Church, Dunshaughlin (Cill Sechnaill, Dún Seachlainn)====
Sechnall (Secundinus) was the founder and patron saint of Domhnach Sechnaill, Co. Meath, who went down in medieval tradition as a disciple of St Patrick and one of the first bishops of Armagh. Although modern historians have disputed his connection with St Patrick and suggested this was later tradition in fact invented by Armagh historians in favour of their patron saint and that Secundinus is more likely to have been a separate missionary, possibly a companion of Palladius.

Secundinus was the author of an early Latin hymn in praise of St Patrick, known as Audite Omnes Amantes (&quot;Hear ye, All lovers&quot;) or the Hymn of Secundinus written in trochaic septenarius, the earliest copy of which is found in the late 7th-century Antiphonary of Bangor.

====Fore Abbey (Mainistir Fhobhair)====
The Christian monastery at Fore was founded by St Feichin, it was estimated that there were as many as 300 monks and 2000 students in residence. Today, all that remains is the pre-Norman building of St Feichin&#x27;s Church, which was built in the 12th century, on top of the original monastery, the ruins are located near the passage tomb and megalithic at Loughcrew Cairns. It was claimed that St Feichin once acted as a mediator between the Muimne, Luigne and Laigne of Connacht and Meath. The saint&#x27;s name may derive from the old Irish word for , which means raven. The name is explained in this manner in a note added to the Félire Óengusso, which says that he received this name when his mother saw him gnawing on a bone and exclaimed &quot;my little raven!&quot; The place name of &quot;Fore&quot; is the anglicised version of the Irish &quot;Fobhar&quot;, meaning &quot;water-springs&quot;. There are two wells associated with St Feichin: one was called Doaghfeighin well and the other Tobernacogany from the Irish meaning &quot;Well of the Kitchen&quot;.

====Scattery Island (Inis Cathaigh)====
A Céile Dé Monastery existed on Scattery Island or Inis Cathaigh which consisted of a monastery and Round Tower. The island was once the hermitage of Senán mac Geircinn, a 6th-century saint. The saint&#x27;s name of Senan is said to have derived from the Christianised and masculinised version of Sionann (pronounced Shannon), a pagan River Goddess associated with the source of the River Shannon. The Old Irish word associated with the name of the island is , also called a Phéist. The word translates as &quot;sea serpent&quot;, which formed part of the Aos sí in Irish folklore; it was a legendary sea monster going back to Pre-Christian times that once inhabited the island and terrorised the people on the island. is also associated with the word &quot;battle&quot; which Saint Senan fought and won against the giant serpent. According to legend the advanced &quot;its eyes flashing flame, with fiery breath, spitting venom and opening its horrible jaws&quot;, but Senan made the sign of the cross, and the beast collapsed and was chained and thrown into the dark waters of Doolough Lake.

A hagiography of Saint Senan and Amra Senáin (&quot;The Eulogy of Senán&quot;) is contained within the Lebar Brec manuscript and also it contains explicit information such as the sex of the that had lived on the island. The poetic eulogy was written by a friend of St Senan called Dallán Forgaill, who was a Chief Ollam of Ireland. Once Senan had expelled the Cathach, he drove him from Scattery into the dark waters of Doolough Lake. A local chieftain called Mac Tail, hired a druid to put a spell on the saint. However, as the druid landed on a nearby island, a tidal wave enveloped him and swept him to his death. The island is still pointed out as or The Druid&#x27;s Rock. It lies between Hog Island and Scattery, and can be seen at low tide.

In the Psalter Cathach of St. Columba, the opening paragraph letter of Q () is decoratively depicted a serpent like head of a fishy beast with its mouth open and wearing a collared cross, the large letter looks like a lower case &quot;g&quot; but is in fact a &quot;q&quot; for &quot;&quot;, the opening words of Psalm 91 which translate as &quot;He who dwells&quot;. The psaltar was the central reason for what was known as the Battle of the Book near Benbulbin. Like Saint Senan, in Scottish folklore Saint Columba had a very similar encounter with a watery beast in the form of the Loch Ness monster in AD 565.
Another important monk who also trained and later served as bishop of Inis Cathaigh after the passing of Saint Senan was Saint Áedán who had been a disciple of Saint Senan on the island. In the , Saint Aidan is described as which translates as &quot;Áedán the brilliant sun of Inis Medcoit&quot;, being the old Irish for Lindisfarne, an Old Irish form of the Cumbric spelling of , which was the language of the Hen Ogledd.

===Culdees in Scotland===

In Scotland a sacred pagan site had existed on the Island of Iona also known as Innis na Druineach (Isle of the Druids) before Saint Columba settled on the island and established a small Culdee hermitage. Later a significant figure in the 9th century Culdee movement in Scotland was Diarmait of Iona. Diarmait took over the abbacy of Iona at time when it was plunged into the depths of turmoil and facing uncertain future during early 9th century with the abbey being continuously attacked and pillaged by Viking Raids, many of the relics of Columba were transferred to Abbey of Kells, an abbacy that was refounded by Diarmait of Iona&#x27;s predecessor Cellach Cellach mac Congaile. Although Kells Abbey had actually already been founded centuries before by Columba around 550 AD on the permission of the High King Diarmait mac Cerbaill, in the space of only a decade of the abbey&#x27;s initial establishment, the same High king on the advice of his Brehon, passed a damning judgement against Columba over the copying of a Saint Finnian&#x27;s book, which sparked the beginning of a period of huge upheaval for the monk, he instigated a bloody rebellion against the king which resulted in many deaths. After a period of deep reflection, Columba travelled to Inishmurray and confessed his guilt to an aged hermit and his Anam Cara called St Molaise, who told him in order to seek penance, he advised the monk to permanently leave his homeland and attempt to convert as many pagan people to the Christian faith as the 300 lives he lost as result of the Battle of Cúl Dreimhne in 561. Not long after, Columba set sail to Dál Riata or Western Scotland and founded Iona Abbey in 563.

In the late 9th century many of the Columban relics of Iona during the Viking raids went to Dunkeld, possibly firstly via Kells. The Lia Fáil, once used by Columba to inaugurate Áedán mac Gabráin, the King of Dál Riata, he performed what was said to be the first ever Christian anointment of an Irish or British king. Áedán mac Gabráin was the first of a line of Scottish kings mentioned in The Prophecy of Berchán written by St Mobhi of Glasnevin. The stone of Destiny was later transferred in the 9th century due to the heavy Viking raids, from Iona to Dunkeld. The abbacy of Dunkeld had become for a short period the main seat of Power and Religion in Alba, the stone was later moved onto Atholl and finally to Scone Abbey. Scholars such as Thomas Owen Clancy credited Abbot Diarmait of Iona as being an instrumental figure in the spread of the Céli Dé church beyond Iona into the land of the Picts and Alba, the Céli Dé movement was seen as a reformed Post-Columban form of the Celtic Christian church. Diarmait of Iona had strong associations with the monastery of Tallaght, he is sometimes confused with a contemporary, disciple of Mael Ruain, a Culdee abbot called Diarmait mac Aeda Róin, of Castledermot, son of Áed Róin and a descendant of the Dál Fiatach mentioned in Unity of Mael Ruain.

Diarmait of Iona would have had the Old Gaelic title of Comarbae which was a special hereditary status initially applied to the Abbot of Iona in medieval Scotland. Generally an abbot considered to be a Comarba was regarded as Chief Bishop of the Kingdom and claimed certain rights and exemptions for themselves. The Abbots were in fact landowners and owned extensive lands known as Termonn, their tenants were afforded certain privileges based on the fact that the seating Abbot was of the same blood, a successor of the founding saint and a keeper of the relics of the founding Saint. The last Abbots of Iona to hold the title of Coarb was mostly likely Diarmait of Iona and his successor Indrechtach. The final Monks and the Columban Relics of Iona escaped to newly founded monasteries, the title of Coarb followed them onto these new monasteries such as Dunkeld. The position of Coarb was not necessary just confined to the abbots of Columba at Iona. It was applied to the Celtic Christian abbots related the principal saint in general, for example the Clan MacLea were the &quot;Coarb of Saint Moluag&quot; of Argyll. The Book of Armagh described St Patrick&#x27;s, Comarba as being Torbach mac Gormáin. An Old Irish law tract exists on the relationship of the Celtic Christian church and early society called Córus Bésgnai which forms part of the Senchas Már.

The religious historian and antiquarian, Godfrey Higgins believed the Culdees were the last remains of the druids and that of the hereditary Abbot of Iona position of Coarb was related to the Phoenician tradition of the Corybantes, ancient people of the Cronus, like the priests of the Galli they worshipped Cybele, a goddess similar in many respects to Brigid, both representative of a Pagan Earth, Fetility and Mother Goddess. Corybantes were also associated with the Curetes or Kuretes, gods of the wild mountainside, inventors of the rustic arts of metalworking, shepherding, hunting and beekeeping. Many of the key abbeys and Priories in Scotland were founded and built on top of sites that were already Celtic Christian Culdee places of worship. A notable example is Culross Abbey, built on top of an ancient church already established by the Culdee of Saint Serf of St Serf&#x27;s Inch. The name of Culross, comes from the Scottish Gaelic of ‘Cuileann Ros’ which relates to the Holly Tree, in plain English it translates as ‘Holly point. Many of the Culdee sites in both Ireland and Scotland may have been key Druidic places of worship in Pre Christian times, as indicated by the distinctive features or characteristics related the natural surrounding landscape in the Gaelic place names.

==== Iona Abbey ====
The founder of the Iona Abbey, Saint Columba, before traveling to Scotland, was under the care of Cruithnechán and he developed a deeply religious feeling which was to lead to such great results, and he received the name in Old Irish of meaning &quot;Dove of the Cell&quot;, the word meant an anchorite&#x27;s cell, it only became associated with the broader meaning of &quot;church&quot; in a later form of Irish. According to the ancient Irish records in the , it was because he so often, he came from the cell in which he read his psalms to meet the children of the neighbourhood and the children would say: &quot;Has our little Colum come today from the cell in Tir-Lughdech in Cinell Conaill?&quot;. While living at Iona, he also had his own wooden hermits cell located on the &#x27;Tòrr an Aba&#x27; which translates to &quot;the mound of the abbot&quot;. Coluim-Cille was later Latinised to , the name is associated with broad categories of doves and pigeons, coincidently also in Hebrew the translation for dove is &quot;Iona&quot; which derives from the biblical god Yonah .

==== Dunkeld ====
Saint Columba was a descendant of the royal dynasty Cenél Conaill similarly to the Culdee abbot of Dunkeld. The builder of Dunkeld Cathedral itself was Constantín mac Fergusa, it replaced the much earlier church built by Columba. The cathedral is commemorated by the Martyrology of Tallaght, which stated it as one of the principal Céli Dé monasteries of the day. As a patron of the Céli Dé, he was a key reformer for the movement in Dunkeld perhaps a collaborator of Abbot Diarmait of Iona, in the Martyrology it describes him as , i.e., a Briton, son of Fergus, of the Picts. When the kings of Dalriada were absorbed into the new unified Kingdom of Alba, the Tanist Stone was for a short period moved to Dunkeld and then later onto Scone Abbey.

==== Moot Hill ====
The druidic mound of Moot Hill, was the location for the Scottish Culdee&#x27;s to build Scone Abbey(later owned by the Augustinian canons), today the Scone Palace is built on the land were the monastery once stood. Moot hill was similar to the Hill of Tara in its prehistory importance, Moot hill or Statute hill was known as a Brehon hill, a judicial place of assembly in pre-Christian times, its name has also been connected to the historical village of Muthill, an important Culdee centre. The name Muthill translated in Scottish gaelic to which means soft ground, possibly related to the Maigh Rein. The Maigh Rein consisted of a race of ancient people called the Conmhaícne who were heavily associated with Sliabh an Iarainn. In Celtic mythology, It was said the Tuatha de Danann, first arrived in Ireland on 1 May (Bealtaine) through a or &quot;in dark clouds&quot; over the mountain of Sliabh an Iarainn.

==== Monymusk Priory ====
The earliest Christian missionaries to arrive in Monymusk in Aberdeenshire were the Culdees or &#x27;Servants of God’, predating the Augustinians arrival and the building of Monymusk Priory. They were likely to be the followers of St. Ninian and his missionaries from Whithorn and into the land of the Picts. The name Monymusk derives from the Old Gaelic words &quot;Muni or Muine muisc&quot; which translates &quot;noxious thicket or bush&quot;.The Culdee monks seem to have been an eremitical society of missionaries whose presence was felt in various parts of Europe and who objected to any form of conformity to a central ecclesiastical organisation. The Monymusk Reliquary is the most priceless surviving relic of the Celtic Church in Scotland. Originally it contained a bone of St. Columba, was venerated as a sacred relic and carried before the Scots army at Bannockburn. The earliest Culdee Prior of Monymusk, had the ancient Gaelic title of Máel Brigte or in the later Latinised translation of Bricius meaning &quot;devotee of St. Brigit&quot;.

==== Fortingall ====
The village of Fortingall or in Gaelic , means &quot;Escarpment Church&quot;, i.e., &quot;church at the foot of an escarpment or steep slope&quot;. A Christian church was first founded in the village by Coeddi, bishop of Iona. In the grounds of the old church, there is what is estimated by some to be up to a 5000 years old yew tree, believed to be the oldest living tree in all of the British isles. Both the Gaelic pagan fire festivals of Samhain and Beltaine were celebrated at the nearby sacred mound of Càrn na Marbh, going back well before even the earliest Christian presence was established in the area.

==== Kingdom of the Rhinns ====
The Martyrology of Óengus gives details about the ancient Norse-Gael, Kingdom of the Rhinns also referred to as Na Renna or Kingdom of the isles, that once existed in the Western isles of Scotland and included other key locations along the Irish Sea. This kingdom includes the region of Galloway, a name that derives from the old Irish of ‘Gallgaidhel’, which means ‘&quot;foreigner (gall) living among the gaels (gaidhel)&quot;’, it referred to the population mix of Scandinavian and Gaelic ethnicity that inhabited Galloway in the Middle Ages. The Galloway area included a hammer-shaped peninsula in the extreme southwest of Wigtownshire in Scotland. The founding ruling dynasty of this Norse-Gael Kingdom was the powerful Uí Ímair or Dynasty of Ivar, founded by Ímar.

The 9th-century Félire Óengusso commoration of Saint Blane on the Isle of Bute, in which it described him as &#x27;Blááni epscopi Cinn Garad i nGallgaedelaib&#x27;, which translates as ‘Feast of Bláán, bishop of Kingarth in Gall-Ghàidheil&#x27;, it seemed to suggest that at the time of Saint Blane in Kingarth and the Isle of Bute, the region was part of Na Renna and the Diocese of the Isles. The Norse-Gael, Kingdom of the Rhinns finally fell when the last king Magnus VI surrendered and conceded the Western Isles to the Kingdom of Scotland at the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Many of the kings of the Kingdom of the Isles are recorded in the Irish annals such as &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot;, &quot;Annals of Inisfallen&quot; and &quot;Senchus fer n-Alban&quot;.

Some of the first Norse settlers on Orkney, Faroe&#x27;s and Iceland were said to be Norse–Gaels, referred to as Vestmenn. When Scandinavians first set foot on these islands they found a community of Culdee monks, referred to as papar. Numerous place names in Orkney are named of these same eremitic Gaelic monks such as Pabbay,&quot;Island of the papar (Culdee)&quot; or Pabay.

===Culdees in Wales and Cornwall===

Although the name ‘Culdee’ is rarely used to refer to the Celtic Saints in Wales and Cornwall, many of them began as hermits, passed on pre-Christian druidic beliefs and traditions into the new Christian age. They originally lived as anchorites and anchoresses, established isolated retreats in the wilderness such as bogs, forests, and small offshore isles, generally in locations and places that held a significance going back to Druidic times, later these sites became major Celtic Christian monasteries. The most famous of the “insular” hubs of monastic life were on Anglesey and Bardsey. The Celtic Christian Church in Wales remained independent of the Holy See up to the late Middle Ages, it resisted any Gregorian reforms that Canterbury and Saint Augustine tried in impose on the early Welsh Church.

==== Saint David ====
Before the writings of St David&#x27;s cult by chronicler Rhygyfarch in the 11th century, St David already had a significant reputation not only in Wales, but across the Irish Sea. The earliest known reference to the Saint David was to be found in the Catalogue of Irish Saints(AD730) as one of three Welsh saints along with Saint Cadog and Saint Gildas described as the ‘holy men of Britain’. The earliest recording of his feast day of the 1st Marsh was written in both the Latin Martyrology of Tallaght and the Old Irish Martyrology of the Félire Óengusso, both most likely the work of the same author, and certainly of the community of the Céli Dé of Tallaght around 800 AD. As early as the 9th century, the Celtic Culdee monks at Tallaght monastery referred to Saint David&#x27;s old hermitage as ‘Dauid Cille Muni’ meaning David&#x27;s cell of the thicket, in old Irish ‘Muni’ or ‘Muine’ (modern Irish) which translates to thicket or bush grove, from which came the cognate and old Welsh translation of ‘Mynyw’ and the Latin of ‘Menevia’. The title of ‘Mynyw’ was as much attributed to the actual Saint as to the place, it moved with him through his life from his earliest hermitage. It has been suggested he spent his infancy, was educated and established his earliest ascetic community at a place called Henfynyw, which in a mutated form means the Old (Hen) bush (Mynyw). The bishop of Mynyw can be traced right back to the Pre-Roman times and the ancient Celtic people of the Demetae also known as the Déisi, a race that once populated much of the Kingdom of Dyfed. In the Welsh triads, it mentions Mynyw as being one of the locations of the three courts of King Arthur, the other two being Celliwig and Pen Rhionydd.

Officially the feast day of Saint David was first established around 10th century initially in the early writings of the Annales Cambriae and then formerly celebrated from the 12th century, when he was canonised by Pope Callixtus II in 1120. David was officially recognised at the Holy See by Pope Callixtus II in 1120, thanks to the work of Bernard (bishop of Menevia). The Cathedral of St Davids or Menevia, was Britain&#x27;s smallest city and began life as a humble tiny hermit&#x27;s cell situated beside the river Alun. The River Alun flows southwestwards to St Brides Bay, the bay&#x27;s derives its name from the Welsh version of the name Saint Brigid called Sant Ffraid. Scholars such as Sabine Baring-Gould, had suggested contrary to the popular belief that the Welsh Brigid(Sant Ffraid) was distinct and not likely to be Brigit of Kildare. She was an Irish nun in legend that first landed from the sea on a floating piece turf at Glan Conwy, in North Wales. The Martyrology of Donegal described her as ‘Brigid of Cille Muine’, where she had her Monastic Cell, with a feast day of 12 November. To the North of the bay is St David&#x27;s Head, which according to the Culhwch and Olwen, was the location where the mythical Wild boar of the Twrch Trwyth first landed after crossing the Irish sea from Ireland before setting out its eventful journey through south wales and on to Cornwall.

The Welsh Celtic Scholar John Rhys had discussed a region just in the vicinity of St Davids or Mynyw, referred to in the Welsh Chronicle and the Synod of Chester as ‘Moni Iudeorum’. Rhys says that some scholars suggest this word, Iudeorum or Judeorum, may relate to the &quot;Jutes,&quot; a Germanic tribe in Northern Europe, but that he believes such a view incorrect. Instead, Rhys put forward the view that they were of Canaanite Phoenicians origins, distantly related to ancient people of Munster and the Milesians race who had invaded Ireland and brought with them the Ogham Alphabet. The Demetae similar to other Celtic Briton tribes such as the Dumnonia were possibly descendants to the Phoenicians and have a lineage traced back to Hispania. The lands of Dumnonia were sometimes associated with the mythical islands of the Cassiterides such as the island of Ictis.

==== Caldey Island ====
Caldey Island history stretches back to over 1500 years to when the first Celtic monastery was built there in the 5th century. The island was named Ynys Bŷr after Saint Pyr, the sixth century, Pyr is named as abbot of the monastery around the year 500 in the Life of St Samson, he replaced Samson of Dol, the son of Amon of Demetae and Anna of Gwent. Since the early 20th century it has been home to a group of Cistercian monks, who carried on the Celtic traditions that had existed. There is a Caldey Ogham Stone in St Illtyd&#x27;s Church, part of the Old Priory on Caldey Island. The stone dates to 5th or 6th Century, and it contains inscriptions both in Latin and in the ancient Ogham script which originated in Ireland, has inscribed on it &#x27;Magl Dubr&#x27; meaning ‘the tonsured servant of Dubricius’ made by St Samson Abbot of Caldey Island. The ogham stone would have belonged to the old Celtic Christian church that existed before the present chapel, it was dug up in the priory grounds in the 19th century.

==== Sant Ffraid (Saint Brigid) and the Celtic Saints of North Wales ====
Sant Ffraid (Brigit) of North Wales was believed to be an Irish nun in legend that first landed from the sea on a floating piece turf at Glan Conwy. She also has strong connections with the island Anglesey. She is the patroness saint of Trearddur bay which had a similar myth to Glan Conwy, that she was said to have arrived from Ireland on a floating piece of turf. The River Braint on the Menai Straits in Anglesey shares its name with the Saint but was actually named after her much earlier pre-Christian predecessor the pagan goddesses of Brigid. An ancient piece of Welsh bardic poetry called ‘Gofara Braint’ describes the river overflowing and bursting its banks after the killing one of the last kings of the Brigantes called Cadwallon ap Cadfan. It depicts the old Celtic tradition that the king was married to the land and the river flooding its banks represents the land goddess in deep mourning at the news of his passing. The poem possibly dates back to an old oral bardic tradition in Wales and found as part of ‘The folds of the bards’ in the Book of Taliesin. The Celtic scholar D. A. Binchy put forward the theory that the Welsh word ‘Brenin’, instead of meaning ‘king’ had originally meant ‘a consort of the tribal goddess Brigantia’. 
The rivers name ‘Afon Braint’ may also have originated from early Irish settlers who had colonised the North Wales during the Sub-Roman period. Celts tended to name their lakes and rivers after goddesses. The name of Llŷn Peninsula is thought to be of Irish origin. ‘Llŷn’ translates from the Old Irish word for a tribe of Irish called the Laigin, of which the province of Leinster also derives its name. Ptolemy called the peninsula Ganganorum Promontorium (English: Peninsula of the Gangani); the Gangani were a sea-mobile tribe of Irish Celts, with possibly strong connections with the Coriondi tribe associated with South Leinster. Writers such as Charles-Edwards, Waldman and Mason had suggested a Coriondi link with a Northern Celtic tribe of Ancient Britons called the Corionototae.

An important Celtic saint of Llŷn Peninsula called Saint Beuno was first registered as a Celtic Saint with a feast day 21 April in the ninth-century in both the Irish martyrologies of Tallaght and of Gorman. He established the monastery of Clynnog Fawr which translates into English to &#x27;the place of the holly-trees&#x27;, according to legend it was said on his death bed to have had visions of the ‘all the saints and druids’. St Beuno&#x27;s well was traditionally used for the treatment of sick children, after bathing the treated child was carried to St Beuno&#x27;s chapel and laid on rushes overnight on Beuno&#x27;s tomb. Holy wells dedicated to Celtic saints or monasteries, in fact, would have once been connected with a Celtic goddess or female deity.

Bardsley Island seems likely to have been a seat of the Culdees, or Colidei, the first religious recluses of Great Britain, who sought Islands and desert places as hermitages, so they might in security worship the true God. The Convent at Bardsey (Enlli) was one of the most ancient religious Institutions in North Wales, established by the king of Llŷn Einion Frenin, who also founded a College on that Island, about the middle of the 9th Century. Dubricius, Archbishop of Caerleon, who had resigned in favour of St Davids, retired to Bardsey, where he died about the year 612, from which circumstance, it is evident that there must have been a religious establishment here prior to that period. Gerald of Wales writing in Speculum Ecclesiae about 1220, used the term “coelibes sive coli dei” translates as “celibate or to worship God” to refer to the hermit Celtic monks of both Enlli as well as for the monks of Beddgelert, Coli dei (Anglicised as Culdees) &quot;is not Latin as Gerald assumes, in translating it as worshipers of God. It comes from the Old Irish of Céilí Dé, meaning &quot;servants of God&quot;. In the old orchard next to the 13th century Christian monastery on the island was discovered in 1998 by Ian Sturrock what was later classed as ‘the rarest apple trees in the world’.

Historians such as John Koch, Eric P. Hamp and several others put forward the view that the broader regional name of Gwynedd was in fact linguistically related to the Old Irish word of &quot;Féni&quot;, which was a word in ancient Ireland meaning a pure aboriginal people, similar to the word Goídel, it associates with a tribe that inhabit the woods and forests, a Freeholding (Féine) class of people and according to Lebor Gabála Érenn as the name ‘Féni’ suggests were distant descendants of the legendary figure of Fénius, alleged to be one of the mythical inventors of the tree alphabet called Ogham. In Primitive Irish the word ‘weidh-n-‘ meant &quot;Forest People&quot; or &quot;Wild People&quot;, while in Proto-Indo-European a combination of gwyn (“white, fair”) and ‘weydh’ (“wood, wilderness”). The Welsh word for an Irishperson or Goidel was ‘Gwyddel’ which also has the double meaning in Welsh of &quot;wild or barbarian&quot;. In Latin Gwynedd was called ‘Venedotia’ comes from the Brythonic of ‘Ueneda’ which means ‘Warrior Bands’, similar to the ‘Fianna’ who formed part of the Feni. Venedotia also possibly relates to the tribes of the Irish Venii and also to the British Venicones, an ancient Celtic tribe which once originated in what is today Fife, north of the Forth, a part of Scotland later associated with a strong tradition of providing the ancient legal office of &quot;High Brithem&quot; or in Latinised form of Justiciar of Scotia. The founding family of Earldom of Fife was Clan MacDuff, who were also the hereditary Abbots of the Culdee abbey at Abernethy, which features a Round tower, a typical landmark of many early Culdee monasteries. Scholars have suggested that &#x27;Afarnach&#x27;s hall&#x27; in the Old Welsh poem of the Pa gur was a reference to Abernethy mentioned as part of Arthurian legends, in the poem Arthur leads a band warriors against creatures of the otherworld similar to that depicted Fionn mac Cumhaill and the Fianna in Irish mythology. The earliest reference to the town of the Venicones tribe was by Ptolemy as being ‘Orrea’ situated at Carpow, located on the same lands of Abernethy, once owned by a king of the Picts, Nechtan, also close to Pickish hill fort of Clatchard Craig, now controversially partially destroyed. During Roman times it was recorded as ‘Horrea Classis’ in the Ravenna Cosmography, a military stores base for the Roman fleet. The Venii tribe were also connected with what Ptolemy referred to them as the Venicnii in Donegal, they were identified being part of the Irish Feni, more tan likely related to the Northern Uí Néill. The Kingdom of Gwynedd was founded by the Venicones who were part of the Kingdom of Manaw Gododdin, north of the Forth. Brythonic-speaking, Kingdom of Manaw Gododdin would later become part of Hen Ogledd, the name ‘Manaw’ derives from the Celtic sea god Manann or Manawydan as known in Welsh mythology. One of the earliest Kings of Gwynedd was the legendary High King known as Maelgwn which means in Middle Welsh name meaning &#x27;Princely Hound or Warrior’, a great-grandson of Cunedda.

Professor Dáithí Ó hÓgáin seems to indicate that Niall of the Nine Hostages maybe a descendant of the Gaulish seafaring Celtic tribe of the Veneti. According to Professor Dáithí Ó hÓgáin, Niall&#x27;s great ancestor was the legendary figure of Túathal Techtmar, possibly a name that comes from an earlier Gaulish god of Toutatis (“Ruler of the Tribe”). Túathal Techtmar was a leader of the northern branch of the Venii (tribes-men) in Ireland and notably lead the overthrow of the Laigin (Lance men) tribe at Tara around AD 300. The Venii tribe in Ireland only later formerly changed name to a class of people known as the ‘Irish Feni’, when Conn Cétchathach first established the Kingdom of Connacht and the Leath Cuinn, dividing of island North and South along the Esker Riada.

==== Saint Govan ====
Saint Govan was a hermit who lived in the side of coastal cliff near Bosherston, Pembrokeshire. St. Govan&#x27;s Chapel is built into the side of a limestone cliff, walls constructed from limestone, and consists of two chambers, one in the front and one in the back. He was believed to have been a disciple of Ailbe, who lived in Solva further along Pembrokeshire coast. Govan had served as an abbot at Dairinis under Ailbe, and he was also a disciple of St Senan at the monastery of Inis Cathaigh. ‘Govan’ comes from the cumbric version of the original old Gaelic name for the saint was ‘Goban’ which means ‘a disciple of a blacksmith’, the origin of the name probably goes back to a legendary figure known as ‘Goban Saor’ associated with an ancient island (mound of dry land) on bog land called Derrynaflan which translates as ‘oak of the flanns’, a place which also served as a key Céli Dé monastery in Ireland. A number of Irish Saints share the name of Saint Goban, other forms of the name include Gowan, Gofan (Welsh), and Gobain.

In the Arthurian legends, one version of the death of Sir Gawain, a myth which is more attributed to Welsh folklore, was said to have been laid to rest under Saint Govan&#x27;s Chapel, having retired to live out his days on the site as a hermit after his uncle Arthur&#x27;s death.

==== Saint Modomnoc ====
The Félire Óengusso names the beekeeper at Saint Davids monastery as a disciple called Modomnoc, who is said in myth on Saint David&#x27;s consent to have introduced the honeybee to Ireland on his return to the island from Wales. In Celtic mythology bees were seen as beings of great wisdom and as spiritual messengers between this world and the gods of spiritual realm. The Irish Pagan Goddess Brigid was said to have kept an apple orchard in the Otherworld, the bees of her hives carried their magical golden nectar into the living world, Brigid is strongly connected with an island close to Glastonbury tor called Brides mound. The old and Celtic name for Glastonbury was Avalon, which means the ‘island of the apple orchards’, it stems from the Welsh word for apple ‘afal’. The apple tree was represented by ‘Queirt’ in the Celtic Ogham alphabet, the fruit has a strong association with islands and the Otherworld in Celtic Mythology, such as Tír na nÓg. Honey was the key ingredient of mystical alcoholic beverage of mead, according to the Brehon laws it was used in the pagan inauguration process for kings, the name is associated the sovereignty goddesses of Medb also known as the &quot;mead-woman&quot; or &quot;she who intoxicates&quot;.

==== Saint Máedóc (Aidan) of Ferns ====
There had been several Irish saints named Aidan but this one seems to have been one of the most important and is mentioned in the Welsh triads as one of the three close disciples of Saint David. Aidan, referred to in Old Irish as Mo-áed-óc which translates as my (Mo), dear little (óc or óg) and sandwiched in between the name Áed. The anglicised name of ‘Marmaduke’ derives from the old Irish of ‘Máel Maedoc’ meaning devotee of Maedoc. The word ‘Máel’ translates ‘devotee of’ and is also associated with the followers of a number important Christian religious figures such as Máel Coluim (Columba), Máel Brigte (Brigid) and Máel Ísu (Jesus). Saint Máedóc traveled to Wales to study under Saint David at Menevia in Pembrokeshire for several years. Welsh tradition maintains that Aidan succeeded Saint David as the abbot of Menevia and for that reason Wales later claimed jurisdiction over Ferns in Wexford because a Welsh abbot founded it. The shrine of Breac Maodhóg is a relic associated with Saint Maedoc.

He became the first Bishop of Ferns after King Brandub of the Uí Ceinnselaig, a royal dynasty of Leinster granted him lands in the area, before Aidan&#x27;s appointment the parish previously came most likely under the jurisdiction or see of Saint Sletty of Fiach. The monastery of Saint Marys Abbey in Ferns was built by the king leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, who was a Gaelic king noted in Irish history for his shady dealings with the Normans and the Earldom of Pembroke which ultimately lead to the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century. In Pre-Norman times, Ferns was once the ancient capital of Leinster and the seat of Diarmait Mac Murchada and his descendants. where he established a monastery.

A story about a stag was attributed and depicted in many artworks associated to both Aidan of Ferns and also to his namesake Aidan of Lindisfarne, about one day as he was sate reading in Connacht, a desperate stag took refuge with him in the hope of escaping pursuing hounds. Aidan miraculously by reciting his prayers made the stag invisible, and the hounds ran off. The story possibly relates to the myth that some early Celtic Saints developed a miraculous powers known as the spell of concealment which were special powers passed down from the Druid magic mist of a Pre-Christian era.

==== Saint Máedóc (Aidan) of Llawhadan ====
Saint Máedóc (Aidan) was also connected with the Welsh parish of Llanhuadain, the name translates as the &quot;monastic enclosure (Llan) of St Aidan&quot;, the village is part of the broader community of Narberth, which was steeped in Welsh Pre-Christian history and mythology. Llanduadain and Robeston Wathen formed part of the ancient administrative area of Narberth Hundred. On one side of Narberth is Clynderwen, there is a bilingual Latin-Old Irish Ogham stone with the inscription Votecorigas written on it, who was a King of Dyfed in the early to mid-6th century.

The town of Narberth itself was connected to the Welsh Otherworld, its name stems from the ‘Gorsedd Arberth’ which translates as the Throne Mound, it was located near Pwyll&#x27;s court, just south of the town and was seen in ancient Welsh myth as a key portal to the kingdom of the otherworld, the Welsh Gorsedd Arberth is a hill equivalent to the Sidh or a Teamhair in Irish mythology, a sacred inaugural and ancestral mound.

It was on the Gorsedd Arbeth near the court of Dyfed the legendary prince of Dyfed, would become Pwyll Pen Annwn (Pwyll Head of the Annwn) when he had his first meeting with the otherworldly woman Rhiannon and they gave birth to a son Pryderi fab Pwyll, born in Narberth. Pryderi became the ruler of the seven Cantref of Dyfed and he was part of the mythical figures of Llŷr in Welsh mythology. In the Mabinogi third branch, Manawydan son of Llŷr and Rhiannon take a walk to the throne of Arberth (Gorsedd Narberth) to look over the land from the top of the mound when a great mist of enchantment falls on them. When the mist lifts, the entire kingdom of Dyfed was deserted, everyone and everything had disappeared without trace. The stories of the Mabinogion originated out of a middle Welsh oral tradition passed down generations which were later transferred to written text.

Rhiannon has similarities with Queen Macha in Irish Mythology. She represents the fertility of the land in the form of a Celtic Sovereignty goddesses, granting her future husband sovereignty as king of the land through the act of marriage. She also had strong connections with horses similar to Queen Macha who also had her prize Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend (&quot;grey of Macha&quot;), who later features as one of the two Cú Chulainn chariot-horses in the tale of the Táin Bó Cúailnge.

==== Saint Illtud ====
In Wales, Saint Illtud was a very important Culdee figure in Celtic Christianity, he founded a monastery and college, a University of the Celtic Saints in Llantwit Major. The college known as Côr Tewdws is understood to have been founded c. 395, making it the earliest school, former or extant, in all of Great Britain. It has also been referred to as &quot;the oldest college in the world&quot;. Other examples of Culdee hermitages are Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Islands and Penmon abbey on the Isle of Anglesea, an island which has strong druidic history.

==== Saint Ailbe ====
The Martyrology of Tallaght lists the feast dates of five principal Pre-Patrician Christian Saints as being Abbán of Moyarny, Ailbe of Emly, Ciarán of Saigir, Declán of Ardmore and Ibar of Beggerin. All are said to be originally from Munster and also as being the earliest recorded Christian Saints that had existed in Ireland prior to the arrival of Saint Patrick. Most notable of the five is Ailbe of Emly, he is the patron saint of Munster and also known as St Eilfyw in Wales, where he founded a tiny community called St Elvis in Wales believed to have been one of the smallest parishes to be established in Britain, which is named after him, its just four miles north of the ancient city of St Davids. It&#x27;s been suggested by certain scholars that it was Saint Ailbe who baptised Saint David 454 AD at Port Clais in Dyfed. In 2000 Terry Breverton, a lecturer at Cardiff University, while promoting his book, suggested that the rock star Elvis Presley&#x27;s ancestral roots came from the Celtic prehistoric site of Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire and may have had links to a chapel at St Elvis.

==== Celtic Christianity in Cornwall ====
One of the earliest Celtic Christian Churches found in Britain is St Piran&#x27;s Oratory and Old Church in Perranzabuloe, dating from the 6th century. A Cornish saint called Saint Madron was said to have been a disciple of Ciarán of Saigir, some scholars have suggested he may have been a Christianisation of the pre-Christian, pagan goddess of Modron, mother to Mabon.

====Bride&#x27;s Hill (Glastonbury)====
At St Michael&#x27;s Church Tower on Glastonbury Tor, there&#x27;s a carved depiction of Saint Brigid milking a cow at the entrance to the tower, Brigit has strong connections with nearby ancient Hermitage settlement of Bride&#x27;s Hill located on an island in the Avalon Marshes. The Glastonbury Tor hill itself is associated with the Welsh Otherworld in Pagan times going back possibly centuries before the Christian church was built on its peak.

==A conflicting interpretation==
The term Culdee has been improperly applied to the whole Celtic church, and a superior purity has been claimed for it. It has also been asserted, that the Kelts or Culdees were the forerunners of Protestantism. Protestant writers alleged that the Culdees had preserved Celtic Christianity, free from supposed Roman corruptions, in one remote corner of western Europe. This view was enshrined in Thomas Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Reullura&quot;:

:Peace to their shades. The pure Culdees
:Were Albyn&#x27;s earliest priests of God,
:Ere yet an island of her seas
:By foot of Saxon monk was trod.

However, Schaff maintains, &quot;...this inference is not warranted. Ignorance is one thing, and rejection of an error from superior knowledge is quite another thing. ...There is not the least evidence that the Keltic church had a higher conception of Christian freedom, or of any positive distinctive principle of Protestantism...&quot;

==&quot;Culdee&quot; in fiction==
*In The Railway Series by Rev. W. Awdry there is a rack railway called the Culdee Fell Railway. One of the steam locomotives is named &quot;Culdee&quot;. In the Island of Sodor&#x27;s fictional Gaelic language of Sudric, &#x27;Culdee&#x27; is said to translate as &#x27;Companion of God&#x27;, the mountain being named for the island&#x27;s Patron Saint, Machan. The Rev. Awdry often used names from religion and the Anglican Church as placenames in his books. The island of Sodor where the series takes place, for example, is named after a Church of England Diocese, the Diocese of Sodor and Man.
*Geoffrey Moorhouse&#x27;s &#x27;Sun Dancing&#x27;, the fictional sections feature an account of a particular ascetic Culdee
*Stephen Lawhead&#x27;s novels &quot;Byzantium&quot;, &quot;Patrick&quot;, and the &quot;Celtic Crusades&quot; trilogy focus on the Cele De.
*J.P. Moore&#x27;s short story &quot;Useful Visions&quot; is set in a Culdee monastery.
*A colony of Culdees in Iceland appears in H. Warner Munn&#x27;s fantasy novel, Merlin&#x27;s Ring.
*Culdees are a prominent part of the story of the &quot;Tile Cutters&#x27; Penny&quot; by Caiseal Mor
*In Proinsias Mac a&#x27; Bhaird&#x27;s Tairngreacht, a modern sect of Céile Dé or &#x27;Culdees&#x27; engage in a conspiracy against the Vatican.

<text>Kassel is one of the three of Hesse, Germany, located in the north of the state. It was created in 1866 when Prussia annexed the Electorate of Hesse, forming part of the new Province of Hesse-Nassau. It was enlarged following the incorporation of the former Free State of Waldeck in 1929. From 1944 to 1945 it formed its own province: Kurhessen. After World War II it became part of Greater Hesse within the American Occupation Zone, the precursor to the modern state of Hesse. In its modern form it consists of 138 municipalities.


== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was €45.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 1.4% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €34,200 or 113% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 96% of the EU average.

<doc id="191703" wikidata="Q191624" url="?curid=191703" title="Anthropocentrism">
<text>Anthropocentrism (; ) is the belief that human beings are the central or most important entity on the planet. The term can be used interchangeably with humanocentrism, and some refer to the concept as human supremacy or human exceptionalism. From an anthropocentric perspective, humankind is seen as separate from nature and superior to it, and other entities (animals, plants, minerals, etc.) are viewed as resources for humans to use.

It is possible to distinguish between at least three types of anthropocentrism: perceptual anthropocentrism (which &quot;characterizes paradigms informed by sense-data from human sensory organs&quot;); descriptive anthropocentrism (which &quot;characterizes paradigms that begin from, center upon, or are ordered around &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; / ‘the human&#x27;&quot;); and normative anthropocentrism (which &quot;characterizes paradigms that make assumptions or assertions about the superiority of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, its capacities, the primacy of its values, [or] its position in the universe&quot;).

Anthropocentrism tends to interpret the world in terms of human values and experiences. It is considered to be profoundly embedded in many modern human cultures and conscious acts. It is a major concept in the field of environmental ethics and environmental philosophy, where it is often considered to be the root cause of problems created by human action within the ecosphere. However, many proponents of anthropocentrism state that this is not necessarily the case: they argue that a sound long-term view acknowledges that the global environment must be made continually suitable for humans and that the real issue is shallow anthropocentrism.

==Environmental philosophy==
Some environmental philosophers have argued that anthropocentrism is a core part of a perceived human drive to dominate or &quot;master&quot; the Earth. Anthropocentrism is believed by some to be the central problematic concept in environmental philosophy, where it is used to draw attention to claims of a systematic bias in traditional Western attitudes to the non-human world that shapes humans&#x27; sense of self and identities. Val Plumwood argued that anthropocentrism plays an analogous role in green theory to androcentrism in feminist theory and ethnocentrism in anti-racist theory. Plumwood called human-centredness &quot;anthrocentrism&quot; to emphasise this parallel.

One of the first extended philosophical essays addressing environmental ethics, John Passmore&#x27;s &quot;Man&#x27;s Responsibility for Nature&quot;, has been criticised by defenders of deep ecology because of its anthropocentrism, often claimed to be constitutive of traditional Western moral thought. Indeed, defenders of anthropocentrism concerned with the ecological crisis contend that the maintenance of a healthy, sustainable environment is necessary for human well-being as opposed to for its own sake. According to William Grey, the problem with a &quot;shallow&quot; viewpoint is not that it is human-centred: &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. According to this view, we need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception.&quot; In turn, Plumwood in &quot;Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason&quot; argued that Grey&#x27;s anthropocentrism is inadequate.

Many devoted environmentalists encompass a somewhat anthropocentric-based philosophical view supporting the fact that they will argue in favor of saving the environment for the sake of human populations. Grey writes: &quot;We should be concerned to promote a rich, diverse, and vibrant biosphere. Human flourishing may certainly be included as a legitimate part of such a flourishing.&quot; Such a concern for human flourishing amidst the flourishing of life as a whole, however, is said to be indistinguishable from that of deep ecology and biocentrism, which has been proposed as both an antithesis of anthropocentrism and as a generalised form of anthropocentrism.

== Cognitive psychology ==
In cognitive psychology, the term &quot;anthropocentric thinking&quot; has been defined as &quot;the tendency to reason about unfamiliar biological species or processes by analogy to humans.&quot; Reasoning by analogy is an attractive thinking strategy, and it can be tempting to apply one&#x27;s own experience of being human to other biological systems. For example, because death is commonly felt to be undesirable, it may be tempting to form the misconception that death at a cellular level or elsewhere in nature is similarly undesirable (whereas in reality programmed cell death is an essential physiological phenomenon, and ecosystems also rely on death). Conversely, anthropocentric thinking can also lead people to underattribute human characteristics to other organisms. For instance, it may be tempting to wrongly assume that an animal that is very different from humans, such as an insect, will not share particular biological characteristics, such as reproduction or blood circulation.

Anthropocentric thinking has predominantly been studied in young children (mostly up to the age of 10) by developmental psychologists interested in its relevance to biology education. Children as young as 6 have been found to attribute human characteristics to species unfamiliar to them (in Japan), such as rabbits, grasshoppers or tulips. Although relatively little is known about its persistence at a later age, evidence exists that this pattern of human exceptionalist thinking can continue through young adulthood at least, even among students who have been increasingly educated in biology.

The notion that anthropocentric thinking is an innate human characteristic has been challenged by study of American children raised in urban environments, among whom it appears to emerge between the ages of 3 and 5 years as an acquired perspective. Children&#x27;s recourse to anthropocentric thinking seems to vary with their experience of nature, and cultural assumptions about the place of humans in the natural world. For example, whereas young children who kept goldfish were found to think of frogs as being more goldfish-like, other children tended to think of frogs in terms of humans. More generally, children raised in rural environments appear to use anthropocentric thinking less than their urban counterparts because of their greater familiarity with different species of animals and plants. Studies involving children from some of the indigenous peoples of the Americas have found little use of anthropocentric thinking. Study of children among the Wichí people in South America showed a tendency to think of living organisms in terms of their perceived taxonomic similarities, ecological considerations, and animistic traditions, resulting in a much less anthropocentric view of the natural world than is experienced by many children in Western societies.

==Judaeo–Christian traditions==
In the 1985 CBC series &quot;A Planet For the Taking&quot;, David Suzuki explored the Old Testament roots of anthropocentrism and how it shaped human views of non-human animals. Some Christian proponents of anthropocentrism base their belief on the Bible, such as the verse 1:26 in the Book of Genesis:
The use of the word &quot;dominion&quot; in the &quot;Genesis&quot; has been used to justify an anthropocentric worldview, but recently some have found it controversial, viewing it as possibly a mistranslation from the Hebrew. However an argument can be made that the Bible actually places all the importance on God as creator, and humans as merely another part of creation.

Moses Maimonides, a Torah scholar who lived in the twelfth century AD, was renowned for his staunch opposition to anthropocentrism. He referred to humans as &quot;just a drop in the bucket&quot; and asserted that &quot;humans are not the axis of the world&quot;. He also claimed that anthropocentric thinking is what leads humans to believe in the existence of evil things in nature. According to Rabbi Norman Lamm, Moses Maimonides &quot;refuted the exaggerated ideas about the importance of man and urged us to abandon these fantasies.

Catholic social teaching sees the pre-eminence of human beings over the rest of creation in terms of service rather than domination. Pope Francis, in his 2015 encyclical letter &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;, notes that &quot;an obsession with denying any pre-eminence to the human person&quot; endangers the concern which should be shown to protecting and upholding the welfare of all people, which he argues should rank alongside the &quot;care for our common home&quot; which is the subject of his letter. In the same text he acknowledges that &quot;a mistaken understanding&quot; of Christian belief &quot;has at times led us to justify mistreating nature, to exercise tyranny over creation&quot;: in such actions, Christian believers have &quot;not [been] faithful to the treasures of wisdom which we have been called to protect and preserve. In his follow-up exhortation, &quot;Laudate Deum&quot; (2023) he refers to a preferable understanding of &quot;the unique and central value of the human being amid the marvellous concert of all God&#x27;s creatures&quot; as a &quot;situated anthropocentrism&quot;.

== Human rights ==
Anthropocentrism is the grounding for some naturalistic concepts of human rights. Defenders of anthropocentrism argue that it is the necessary fundamental premise to defend universal human rights, since what matters morally is simply being human. For example, noted philosopher Mortimer J. Adler wrote, &quot;Those who oppose injurious discrimination on the moral ground that all human beings, being equal in their humanity, should be treated equally in all those respects that concern their common humanity, would have no solid basis in fact to support their normative principle.&quot; Adler is stating here that denying what is now called human exceptionalism could lead to tyranny, writing that if humans ever came to believe that they do not possess a unique moral status, the intellectual foundation of their liberties collapses: &quot;Why, then, should not groups of superior men be able to justify their enslavement, exploitation, or even genocide of inferior human groups on factual and moral grounds akin to those we now rely on to justify our treatment of the animals we harness as beasts of burden, that we butcher for food and clothing, or that we destroy as disease-bearing pests or as dangerous predators?&quot;

Author and anthropocentrism defender Wesley J. Smith from the Discovery Institute has written that human exceptionalism is what gives rise to human duties to each other, the natural world, and to treat animals humanely. Writing in &quot;A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy&quot;, a critique of animal rights ideology, &quot;Because we &quot;are&quot; unquestionably a unique species—the only species capable of even contemplating ethical issues and assuming responsibilities—we uniquely are capable of apprehending the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, proper and improper conduct toward animals. Or to put it more succinctly, if being human isn&#x27;t what requires us to treat animals humanely, what in the world does?&quot;

== Moral status of animals ==

Anthropocentrism is closely related to the notion of speciesism, defined by Richard D. Ryder as a &quot;a prejudice or attitude of bias in favour of the interests of members of one&#x27;s own species and against those of members of other species&quot;.

=== Early critiques ===
One of the earliest critics of anthropocentrism was Edward Payson Evans in his book &quot;Evolutional Ethics and Animal Psychology&quot; (1897), where he challenges the idea that humans are fundamentally distinct from other sentient beings. He argues that anthropocentric psychology and ethics persist, treating humans as superior and denying mental or moral connections to other species. Evans suggests these beliefs stem from human self-importance, which overlooks the shared qualities of sentience across species and questions the ethical implications of such a view.

Later, J. Howard Moore, in &quot;The Universal Kinship&quot; (1906), expanded on this critique, asserting that Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859) &quot;sealed the doom&quot; of anthropocentrism. Moore argued that the doctrine of organic evolution, which established the common genesis of all animals, fundamentally altered humanity&#x27;s view of its place in the natural world. Before the publication of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, humans may have been seen as distinct from other creatures, but with the advent of evolutionary theory, all species were recognized as sharing a common ancestry. Moore considered this shift one of the most significant intellectual developments, comparable to the groundbreaking insights of Galileo and Copernicus.

=== Challenging human exceptionalism ===
While humans cognition is relatively advanced, many traits traditionally used to justify humanity exceptionalism (such as rationality, emotional complexity and social bonds) are not unique to humans. Research in ethology has shown that non-human animals, such as primates, elephants, and cetaceans, also demonstrate complex social structures, emotional depth, and problem-solving abilities. This challenges the claim that humans possess qualities absent in other animals, and which would justify denying moral status to them.

=== Animal welfare perspectives ===
Animal welfare proponents attribute moral consideration to all sentient animals, proportional to their ability to have positive or negative mental experiences. It is notably associated with the ethical theory of utilitarianism, which aims to maximize well-being. It is notably defended by Peter Singer. According to David Pearce, &quot;other things being equal, equally strong interests should count equally.&quot; Jeremy Bentham is also known for raising early the issue of animal welfare, arguing that &quot;the question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?&quot;. Animal welfare proponents can in theory accept animal exploitation if the benefits outweigh the harms. But in practice, they generally consider that intensive animal farming causes a massive amount of suffering that outweighs the relatively minor benefit that humans get from consuming animals.

=== Animal rights perspectives ===
Animal rights proponents argue that all animals have inherent rights, similar to human rights, and should not be used as means to human ends. Unlike animal welfare advocates, who focus on minimizing suffering, animal rights supporters often call for the total abolition of practices that exploit animals, such as intensive animal farming, animal testing, and hunting. Prominent figures like Tom Regan argue that animals are &quot;subjects of a life&quot; with inherent value, deserving moral consideration regardless of the potential benefits humans may derive from using them.

==In popular culture==
In fiction from all eras and societies, there is fiction depicting the actions of humans to ride, eat, milk, and otherwise treat (non-human) animals as inferior. There are occasional fictional exceptions, such as talking animals as aberrations to the rule distinguishing people from animals.

In science fiction, &quot;humanocentrism&quot; is the idea that humans, as both beings and as a species, are the superior sentients. Essentially the equivalent of racial supremacy on a galactic scale, it entails intolerant discrimination against sentient non-humans, much like race supremacists discriminate against those not of their race. A prime example of this concept is utilized as a story element for the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series. After humanity&#x27;s first contact results in a brief war, many humans in the series develop suspicious or even hostile attitudes towards the game&#x27;s various alien races. By the time of the first game, which takes place several decades after the war, many humans still retain such sentiments in addition to forming &#x27;pro-human&#x27; organizations.

This idea is countered by anti-humanism. At times, this ideal also includes fear of and superiority over strong AIs and cyborgs, downplaying the ideas of integration, cybernetic revolts, machine rule and Tilden&#x27;s Laws of Robotics.

Mark Twain mocked the belief in human supremacy in &quot;Letters from the Earth&quot; (written c. 1909, published 1962).

The Planet of the Apes franchise focuses on the analogy of apes becoming the dominant species in society and the fall of humans (see also human extinction). In the 1968 film, Taylor, a human states &quot;take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!&quot;. In the 2001 film, this is contrasted with Attar (a gorilla)&#x27;s quote &quot;take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!&quot;. This links in with allusions that in becoming the dominant species apes are becoming more like humans (anthropomorphism). In the film Battle for the Planet of the Apes, Virgil, an orangutan states &quot;ape has never killed ape, let alone an ape child. Aldo has killed an ape child. The branch did not break. It was cut with a sword.&quot; in reference to planned murder; a stereotypical human concept. Additionally, in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Caesar states &quot;I always think...ape better than human. I see now...how much like them we are.&quot;

In George Orwell&#x27;s novel Animal Farm, this theme of anthropocentrism is also present. Whereas originally the animals planned for liberation from humans and animal equality, as evident from the &quot;seven commandments&quot; such as &quot;whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy&quot;, &quot;Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend&quot;, &quot;All animals are equal&quot;; the pigs would later amend the commandments with statements such as &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&quot;, and &quot;Four legs good, two legs better.&quot;

The 2012 documentary &quot;The Superior Human?&quot; systematically analyzes anthropocentrism and concludes that value is fundamentally an opinion, and since life forms naturally value their own traits, most humans are misled to believe that they are actually more valuable than other species. This natural bias, according to the film, combined with a received sense of comfort and an excuse for exploitation of non-humans cause anthropocentrism to remain in society.

In his 2009 book &quot;Eating Animals&quot;, Jonathan Foer describes anthropocentrism as &quot;The conviction that humans are the pinnacle of evolution, the appropriate yardstick by which to measure the lives of other animals, and the rightful owners of everything that lives.&quot;

<text>The Coandă-1910, designed by Romanian inventor Henri Coandă, was an unconventional sesquiplane aircraft powered by a ducted fan. Called the &quot;turbo-propulseur&quot; by Coandă, its experimental engine consisted of a conventional piston engine driving a multi-bladed centrifugal blower which exhausted into a duct. The unusual aircraft attracted attention at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition in Paris in October 1910, being the only exhibit without a propeller, but the aircraft was not displayed afterwards, and it fell from public awareness. Coandă used a similar turbo-propulseur to drive a snow sledge, but he did not develop it further for aircraft.

Decades later, after the practical demonstration of motorjets and turbojets, Coandă began to tell various conflicting stories about how his early experiments were precursors to the jet, even that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine with fuel combustion in the airstream. He also claimed to have made a single brief flight in December 1910, crashing just after takeoff, the aircraft being destroyed by fire. Two aviation historians countered Coandă&#x27;s version of events, saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the airstream, and no proof that the aircraft ever flew. In 1965, Coandă brought drawings forward to prove his claim of combustion ducting, but these were shown to be reworked, differing substantially from the originals. Many aviation historians were dismissive, saying that Coandă&#x27;s turbo-propulseur design involved a weak stream of &quot;plain air,&quot; not a powerful jet of air expanding from fuel combustion.

In 2010, based on the notion that Coandă invented the first jet, the centennial of the jet aircraft was celebrated in Romania. A special coin and stamp were issued, and construction began on a working replica of the aircraft. At the European Parliament, an exhibition commemorated the building and testing of the Coandă-1910.

==Early developments==
Coandă was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests of rockets attached to model aircraft at the Romanian Army arsenal in Bucharest. In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37 kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow. It was around this time that Coandă&#x27;s interest in jet propulsion began, claiming that the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the &quot;Sporthalle&quot; indoor sports arena in Berlin.
Coandă continued his studies at Liège, Belgium, where with his roommate and friend Giovanni Battista Caproni he built the Coandă-Caproni box glider, based on the plans of gliders designed by Otto Lilienthal and Octave Chanute which he previously studied at Charlottenburg and Spandau. In 1909 he was employed as technical director of the Liège-Spa Aeroclub, and at the end of that year, with the help of car manufacturer Joachim he built the Coandă-Joachim glider. Caproni was present when the glider was flown at Spa-Malchamps, Belgium.

==1910s==
With the opening of the &quot;École supérieure d&#x27;aéronautique et de constructions mécaniques&quot; on 15 November 1909, Coandă moved to Paris. As a continuation of his Belgian experiments, and especially looking for a way to test wing aerofoils at higher speeds, he contacted Ernest Archdeacon, the co-founder of &quot;L&#x27;Aero-Club de France&quot;, who in turn directed Coandă to Gustav Eiffel and Paul Painlevé. With their assistance, he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by Eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the North of France railway. In March, he started flying lessons at Reims in a Hanriot monoplane.

Helped by his schoolfriend Cammarotta-AdornoIn, Coandă started to build his slender sesquiplane and the unusual powerplant in a workshop in the courtyard of his house where he tested the thrust of the powerplant on a dynamometer, tests which are described in detail in the April 1910 edition of &quot;La Technique Aéronautique&quot;. He filed for several patents for the mechanism and aircraft on 30 May 1910, with later additions to the existing patents.

Coandă exhibited the aircraft at the Second International Aeronautical Exhibition (commonly referred to as the Paris salon, or Paris flight salon) held from 15 October to 2 November 1910. Together with Henri Fabre&#x27;s &quot;Hydravion&quot;, the first floatplane, Coandă&#x27;s aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed &quot;in solitary state&quot; in an upstairs gallery, separated from the more usual types of aircraft on the main exhibition floor.

The aircraft&#x27;s construction was a novelty for the time. In contrast to the monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application, the exhibit was a sesquiplane which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The cantilevered wings were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from flying wires. According to Coandă&#x27;s description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit. The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by &quot;The Technical World&quot; magazine as having a framework of steel, though the construction photographs indicate that it had a wooden framework. This was triangular in cross-section with convex ribs edged with strips of steel, and strengthened with a covering of heat-shaped moulded plywood. Tubular radiators for engine cooling were located on either side of the cockpit. The vertical struts from the wings were secured to the fuselage with steel collars fixed with screws. The fuselage terminated in a cruciform empennage with control surfaces at 45° angles to vertical and horizontal. Four triangular surfaces at the rear of the tail were controlled using a pair of large Antoinette VII-style steering wheels mounted outside of the cockpit, one on each side, and were used for pitch and directional control. It was an early instance of what are now known as ruddervators. Forward of the tail was a small horizontal stabiliser. The fuel tank was located in the fuselage between the engine and the cockpit.

The most remarkable feature of the aircraft was its engine. Instead of a propeller, a 50 hp (37 kW) inline water-cooled internal combustion engine built by Pierre Clerget at the Clément-Bayard workshop with funding from &quot;L&#x27;Aero-Club de France&quot;, placed in the forward section of the fuselage drove a rotary compressor through a 1:4 gearbox (1,000 rpm on the Clerget turned the compressor at 4,000 rpm), which drew air in from the front and expelled it rearward under compression and with added heat. The compressor, with a diameter of 50 centimetres (20 in), was located within a cowling at the front of the fuselage. According to later Coandă descriptions, cast aluminium components were also made by Clerget to create an engine with a weight of – equivalent to a power-to-weight ratio of , a considerable achievement at the time.

Coandă&#x27;s 1910s-era patents describe the inline piston engine&#x27;s exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat exchangers in contact with the central air flow, then sucked into the compressor inlet to reduce back-pressure on the engine while adding more heat and mass to the airflow. The turbo-propulseur was claimed to be capable of generating of thrust. The powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms: a turbine without propellers, turbo-propulseur, ducted fan or a suction turbine.

Aviation reporters from &quot;The Aero&quot; and &quot;La Technique Aeronautique&quot; were doubtful that the engine could provide sufficient thrust. The engine was noted in &quot;The Aero&quot;, reprinted in &quot;Aircraft&quot;, as being &quot;of remarkably small proportions in relation to the size of the machine.&quot; The writer said the turbo-propulseur was &quot;claimed to give an enormous wind velocity&quot;, but the intake area seemed too small to produce the stated thrust, and that &quot;it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it&quot;, more than supplied by the Clerget.

The Coandă-1910 was reportedly sold to Charles Weymann in October 1910. A daily newspaper from Bucharest wrote in 1910 that the aircraft was constructed in Clerget&#x27;s workshops and that it &quot;will fly in 6–7 weeks near Paris, piloted by Weymann, one of the pilots celebrated at the Rennes aviation meeting.&quot; Another Bucharest newspaper listed the aircraft in November as &quot;sold twice-over&quot;. It may be that Weymann expressed his willingness to buy the aircraft once tests had been carried out.

At the exhibition, reaction among observers was mixed. Some doubted the aircraft would fly, and focused on more likely machines such as the Sloan, the Voisin, or Louis Paulhan&#x27;s design. Others gave special notice to the Coandă-1910, calling it original and ingenious. The reporter from &quot;La Technique Aeronautique&quot; wrote, &quot;In the absence of definitive trials, permitting the precise yield of this machine, it is without doubt premature to say it will supersede the propeller ... the tentative is interesting and we watch it closely.&quot; The official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described Coandă&#x27;s novel wing design, and the unusual empennage. On 15 November 1910, &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot; wrote that if the machine were ever to develop as the inventor hoped, it would be &quot;a beautiful dream&quot;.
After the exhibition the aircraft was moved to a Clément-Bayard workshop at Issy-les-Moulineaux for further testing. This work is reflected by additions to the powerplant-related patents of 3 December. A group of modern-day Romanian investigators led by Dan Antoniu, having examined photographs from 1910, concluded that the rotary compressor featured at the exhibition was a hybrid between the one described in the initial 30 May 1910 patent and that shown in a later patent application. They felt that the exhibition machine had a simpler director system, a different rotor with a smaller intake cone, and that the exhaust gas heat transfer system had not been implemented. According to Gérard Hartmann in his &quot;Dossiers historiques et techniques aéronautique française&quot;, the propulsion system generated only of thrust, and to generate enough thrust for the aircraft to take off (estimated by Coandă at ) Coandă would have had to spin the &quot;turbine&quot; (the rotary compressor) at a speed of 7,000 rpm with the risk of it exploding. This was not tried, but Hartmann concluded that the experiment proved that the solution worked perfectly.

Henri Mirguet writing for &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot; magazine in January 1912, recalled the previous exhibition&#x27;s machine as the &quot;chief attraction&quot; of the 1910 salon. He wrote that Coandă answered his &quot;pressing—and indiscreet—questions&quot; about the turbo-propulseur-powered aircraft at that earlier exhibit, telling him that the machine had attained a speed of 112 kilometres per hour (70 mph) during several &quot;flight tests&quot;, an improbable answer about which Mirguet &quot;reserved judgment&quot;, waiting for confirmation that never materialised.

==Related developments==

The additional turbo-propulseur patent application 13.502, dated 3 December 1910, was implemented on a double-seat motorised sled commissioned by Cyril Vladimirovich, Grand Duke of Russia. With the help of Despujols, a boat maker, and the motor manufacturer Gregoire, Coandă supervised the building of a motor sled, powered by a 30 hp (22 kW) Gregoire engine driving the turbo-propulseur. The sledge was blessed by Russian Orthodox priests at the Despujols plant near Paris on 2 December 1910. Starting the next day, it was exhibited for two weeks at the 12th Automobile Salon of France, alongside Gregoire-powered automobiles on the Gregoire stand. A number of automobile and general interest magazines published photographs or sketches of the sledge. A version of Coandă&#x27;s turbo-propulseur design was shown for the second time in late 1910 at the Grand Palais of Paris. One of the periodicals reported an expected speed of , but no account exists of the sledge being tested.

Coandă continued to work on the Coandă-1910 project at the beginning of 1911, aiming to improve stability, increase the power of the turbo-propulseur, and to implement aerofoil improvements. He applied for new patents for aerodynamic investigations and improvements of the Coandă-1910.
Coandă described a different, more sturdy system for the attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the angle of attack and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines on the sides of the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a supporting surface was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.
In May 1911 Coandă filed English-language patents on the turbo-propulseur design in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as a second French-language patent filed in Switzerland, and he described it for the 1911 publication of &quot;L&#x27;Annuaire de l&#x27;Air&quot;.

The very expensive project of 1910, costing Coandă about one million francs, left him with limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coandă to build the Coandă-1911. He wished to win the French Army-organised Military Aviation Competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy. At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller. The combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one. During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a four-bladed propeller was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version, was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified.
Henri Mirguet writing for &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot; magazine in January 1912 said that the new 1911 aircraft retained the fuselage, the frame and the wing of Coandă&#x27;s 1910 design, but did not keep the turbo-propulseur or &quot;the wooden wingloading surface including the forward longitudinal ribs&quot;. The aircraft was flown on 21 October 1911, but with modest results as the latest modifications, especially those related to the powerplant, did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft. At the military contest, it did not meet the requirement for independent operation of each engine.

Following the 1911 exhibition, at the personal request of Sir George White, Coandă moved to the United Kingdom to take a position as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane Company for a few years. In the next four decades Coandă worked on a great variety of inventions. During World War II he revived his earlier turbo-propulseur engine when he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much like the one made for the Russian Grand Duke. The German contract concluded after one year, yielding no plans for production. Though Coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted.

Coandă and his 1910 aircraft were absent from much of aviation literature of the day. None of the annual issues of &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot; ever mentioned the Coandă-1910 or its turbo-propulseur powerplant. The Soviet engineer Nikolai Rynin made no mention of Coandă in his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines, written in the late 1920s and early &#x27;30s.

==Later claims==
With the arrival of the practical jet engine, several histories of the technology to date were written. A once-classified Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory and Jet Propulsion Laboratory study completed in 1946 described the Coandă-1910 as &quot;probably not flown&quot; but featuring &quot;a mechanical jet propulsion device with a centrifugal blower&quot;, one in which heat from the Clerget piston engine &quot;furnished auxiliary jet propulsion.&quot; In the editorial lead to their 1946 article on Coandă&#x27;s &quot;Augmented Flow&quot;, &quot;Flight&quot; terms it, &quot;scarcely a jet&quot;. In the same year Geoffrey G. Smith chronicled technological development in his book &quot;Gas Turbines and Jet Propulsion for Aircraft&quot;, but did not mention Coandă.

In 1950&#x27;s &quot;l&#x27;aviation d&#x27;Ader et des temps héroiques&quot;, the authors assert that Coandă flew the first jet aircraft at Issy-les-moulineaux for 30 metres (100 ft), ending with a crash. In 1953, &quot;Flight&quot;″s treatment of aircraft in the 50 years since the Wright brothers&#x27; flight included the Coandă-1910 &quot;ducted fan&quot; and said of Coandă that he &quot;believes that he &#x27;took off for a few feet, then came down hurriedly and broke two teeth, quoting J.W. Adderley&#x27;s 1952 letter to the editor of &quot;Flight&quot; after Adderley&#x27;s discussion with Coandă in Paris at the end of World War II. Adderley said he &quot;can definitely confirm that the power unit was of the ducted-fan type, similar in basic principles to the Caproni-Campini aircraft of the 1930s&quot; (referring to the Caproni Campini N.1).

In the early 1950s Coandă began to claim that he had flown his 1910 aircraft himself, and that the 1910 engine was the first motorjet, using fuel injection and combustion to create its thrust. In 1955 and 1956, a number of aviation articles presented the Coandă version of 1910 events. He said he took off and crashed in December 1910 in the presence of aircraft makers Louis Charles Breguet and Gabriel Voisin. Coandă himself spoke on the subject, notably before the Wings Club at New York&#x27;s Biltmore Hotel on 18 January 1956 where he said &quot;I intended to inject fuel into the air stream which would be ignited by the exhaust gases also channelled through the same circular vent&quot;, implying that he never finished the powerplant. Martin Caidin wrote &quot;The Coanda Story&quot; for the May 1956 issue of &quot;Flying&quot;, based on a personal interview. For his article &quot;He Flew in 1910&quot;, René Aubrey interviewed Coandă and wrote a contradictory story in the September 1956 &quot;Royal Air Force Flying Review&quot;, saying that Coandă had flown his unusual aircraft on 16 December 1910, that fuel was certainly injected, and that it was &quot;the first jet flight in the world&quot;. In Aubrey&#x27;s relation of the interview, the aircraft stalled after take-off, throwing Coandă clear, and &quot;gently collapsed to the ground&quot; where it burned. Aubrey wrote that the aircraft engine was &quot;designed by a friend to Coandă&#x27;s specification&quot;, and that its burning exhaust was &quot;directed below and to each side of the fuselage, which was protected by asbestos in vulnerable places.&quot;

In &quot;Jet Age Airlanes&quot; of 1956, Coandă himself published an article entitled &quot;The First Jet Flight&quot;. He submitted the same text that Caidin had written for &quot;Flying&quot; in May:

A collection of aviation stories was published in 1957 by Major Victor Houart, a friend of Coandă&#x27;s, who wrote that he was an eyewitness the day Coandă flew and crashed. One chapter of the book describes how Houart, together with a group of French dragoons, watched as Coandă taxied twice around the airfield, lifted off to avoid the ruins of an old fortification wall, started flames from the engine by applying too much power, and was thrown from the aircraft the moment it hit the wall, with Coandă &quot;not badly hurt&quot;. Houart&#x27;s version put the fuel tank in the overhead wing, which was metal. In further statements, Coandă said that his 1910 aircraft had movable leading edge slots, retractable landing gear and a fuel supply which was held in the overhead wing to reduce fuselage profile and thus drag. In 1965, Coandă presented a set of drawings, photographs and specifications of the 1910 aircraft to the National Air and Space Museum (NASM), prepared by Huyck Corporation and received by Director S. Paul Johnston and early aviation curator Louis Casey.

Rocket engineer G. Harry Stine worked alongside Coandă from 1961 to 1965 at Huyck Corporation, and interviewed him in 1962. In 1967, the magazine &quot;Flying&quot; printed an account written by Stine, which described the landing gear as retracting into the lower wing, with the fuel tank hidden in the upper wing. Stine wrote that Coandă flew on 10 December 1910, and described the heat from the &quot;two jet exhausts&quot; as being &quot;too much for me&quot; after the powerplant was mounted in the aircraft. In the 1980s after Coandă&#x27;s death, Stine wrote a magazine article and a book mentioning the 1910 aircraft, including new details such as the name of master mechanic Pierre Clerget as the friend who helped build the turbo-propulseur. Stine&#x27;s recounting of the 10 December flight included the group of eyewitness French dragoons, asbestos heat shields and metal deflector plates aft of the engine, intended taxiing with unintentional flight, a steep climb with a stall, Coandă thrown clear, and the aircraft crashing to the ground, burning. Stine gave his assessment that &quot;Coanda&#x27;s turbopropulseur had elements of a true jet&quot;, but that the patent application had no indication of the &quot;critical stage—injection of fuel into the compressed air&quot;. He wrote that &quot;although there were several jet-propelled aircraft in existence at an early time—the 1910 Coanda Jet and the 1938 Caproni Campini N.1—the first pure jet aircraft flight was made in Germany in 1938&quot;.

In 1965, Historian Emeritus Paul E. Garber of the NASM interviewed Coandă, who related that the December 1910 flight was no accident, that he had seated himself in the cockpit intending to test five factors: aircraft structure, the engine, the wing lift, the balance of controls, and the aerodynamics. He said that the heat from the engine was &quot;fantastic&quot;, but that he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct the jet blast away from the wooden fuselage. Garber wrote that as Coandă&#x27;s aircraft began to move forward and rise from the ground, &quot;the exhaust flame, instead of fanning outward, curved inward and ignited the aircraft.&quot; In this interview Coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control, but the landing was &quot;abrupt&quot; and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame, the engine reduced to &quot;a few handfuls of white powder.&quot;

===Rebuttals===

In 1960, Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith, aviation historian at the Science Museum in London, reacted to the mid-1950s assertion that Coandă built and flew the first jet engine aircraft. Gibbs-Smith wrote that &quot;there has recently arisen some controversy about this machine, designed by the Romanian-born and French-domiciled Henri Coanda, which was exhibited at the Paris salon in October 1910. Until recently it has been accepted as an all-wood sesquiplane, with cantilever wings, powered by a 50 hp Clerget engine driving a &#x27;turbo-propulseur&#x27; in the form of a large but simple ducted air fan. This fan was fitted right across the machine&#x27;s nose and the cowling covered the nose and part of the engine: the resulting &#x27;jet&#x27; of plain air was to propel the aeroplane.&quot; He wrote that &quot;no claims that it flew, or was even tested, were made at the time&quot;, and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the 1950s—the aircraft was thus &quot;disinterred from its obscurity.&quot; He wrote that the airfield at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a former military exercise ground where the test supposedly took place, was under the constant observation of the French Army who owned it, by French aviation reporters and photographers, and by aviation experts from other countries. He said that the airfield was the &quot;most famous, most used, most observed, and most reported-on &#x27;airfield&#x27; in Paris&quot;, and that all events, let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire, would have been carried in local papers and described in military reports, but no contemporary accounts exist of the Coandă-1910 being tested, flown or destroyed. Gibbs-Smith countered the Coandă assertions point by point, saying that the aircraft did not have a retractable undercarriage, did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots, did not have a fuel tank overhead in the wing, and did not have fuel injected into any turbine. Gibbs-Smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any combustion had been initiated in the engine&#x27;s air stream.

In 1970 Gibbs-Smith wrote another account of the Coanda-1910, using much the same phrasing as in 1960:
In 2010, Antoniu wrote that he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated on the basis of the evidence of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.
In 1980, NASM historian Frank H. Winter examined the 1965 drawings and specifications Coandă prepared while at Huyck Corporation and wrote an article about Coandă&#x27;s claim: &quot;There is a wholly new description of the inner workings of the machine that does not occur in any of the accounts given [in the 1910s] and which defies all of the patent specifications.&quot; He said Coandă told various conflicting stories about his claimed 1910 flight, and that Coandă produced a set of altered drawings as proof of his claims: 

In his article, Winter wondered why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature had been present during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were essentially the same as the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air &quot;or water&quot; flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.

While looking through aviation periodicals and Paris newspapers reporting for the month of December 1910, Winter found that there was a spell of bad weather at Issy during which no flying took place. This situation occurred mid-month, the period covering the conflicting dates (10 and 16 December) that Coandă said his aircraft was tested, flown and crashed. In their regular &quot;Foreign Aviation News&quot; column, &quot;Flight&quot; magazine reported that the &quot;blank period&quot; of inclement weather at Issy ended on the 19th when Guillaume Busson tested a monoplane made by Armand Deperdussin. Other aircraft tests and piloting activities were listed, with no mention of Coandă or his machine.

Winter found that Camille (or Cosimo) Canovetti, an Italian civil and aviation engineer, had been working on a turbo-propulseur-style aviation engine before Coandă, and had attempted to show an aircraft with such an engine at the Aviation Exposition in Milan in 1909. Canovetti took out patents on his machine in 1909, and more in 1910. Canovetti wrote in 1911 that the 1910 appearance of the Coandă engine &quot;called general attention&quot; to designs like his.

==After Coandă&#x27;s death==
Modern reference books about aviation history represent the Coandă-1910 in various ways, if they mention the machine or the inventor at all. Some acknowledge Coandă as the discoverer of the Coandă effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight, and Frank Whittle the honour of completing and patenting the first jet engine capable of such flight. In their 1994 book &quot;American Aviation&quot;, authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that Coandă&#x27;s 1910 aircraft was the first jet.

Aviation author Bill Gunston changed his mind two years after publishing a 1993 book in which he gave Coandă credit for the first jet engine. Gunston&#x27;s 1995 description began: &quot;Romanian Henri Coanda built a biplane with a Clerget inline piston engine which, instead of turning a propeller, drove a centrifugal compressor blowing air to the rear. The thrust was said to be 220 kilograms [490 lb], a figure the author disbelieves. On 10 December 1910 the aircraft thus powered inadvertently became airborne, crashed and burned. Often called &#x27;a turbine aeroplane&#x27;, this was of no more significance than the Campini aircraft mentioned later, and Coanda wisely decided to switch to a propeller.&quot; In his publication of 1998, &quot;World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines: All major aircraft power plants, from the Wright brothers to the present day&quot;, Gunston did not include Coanda; nor did he include Coanda in 2005&#x27;s &quot;Jane&#x27;s Aero-Engines&quot; or 2006&#x27;s &quot;World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines&quot;.

Walter J. Boyne, director of the National Air and Space Museum and a prolific aviation author, mentions Coandă in passing a few times in his works. Boyne discusses Coandă briefly in one of his books, &quot;The Leading Edge&quot;: &quot;Professor Henri Coanda, whose scientific work was impeccable, designed and built a jet aircraft in 1910; it, like Martin&#x27;s Kitten [the Martin KF-1 biplane], was superbly built and technically advanced—and could not fly.&quot; In a later magazine article sidebar, Boyne described more details: &quot;Romanian inventor Henri Coanda attempted to fly a primitive jet aircraft in 1910, using a four-cylinder internal combustion engine to drive a compressor at 4,000 revolutions per minute. It was equipped with what today might be called an afterburner, producing an estimated 500 pounds [2.3 kN or 230 kgf] of thrust. Countless loyal Coanda fans insist that the airplane flew. Others say it merely crashed.&quot;

In 1980 and 1993, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Aviation&quot; included an entry on the 1910 aircraft, calling it the &quot;Coanda turbine&quot; and describing it as &quot;the world&#x27;s first jet-propelled aircraft to fly&quot;. In 2003, Winter co-authored a book with fellow NASM curator F. Robert van der Linden: &quot;100 Years of Flight: A Chronicle of Aerospace History, 1903–2003&quot;. In the book the Coandă-1910 is described as an unsuccessful ducted fan aircraft lacking documentation to substantiate any flight test.

Citing Carl A. Brown&#x27;s 1985 &quot;A History of Aviation&quot;, Tim Brady, the Dean of Aviation at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, wrote in 2000: &quot;the development of the jet is, broadly, the story of three men: Henri Coanda, Sir Frank Whittle, and Pabst von Ohain...&quot; His description of Coandă&#x27;s disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in the rotary compressor&#x27;s vent, with the novel detail that the aircraft &quot;flew for about a thousand feet [300 m] before crashing into a wall.&quot; In 1990 at the 24th Symposium of the International Academy of Astronautics, one of the papers presented included this sentence: &quot;It is to Henri Coanda (1886–1972), a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight, that space engineering owes—beside one of the first model planes provided with a rocket engine (1905)—the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft, the &#x27;Coanda-1910&#x27;.&quot; In 2007 in his popular book &quot;Extreme Aircraft&quot;, Ron Miller wrote that the powerplant in the Coandă-1910 was one of the &quot;earliest attempts&quot; at a jet engine, but was unsuccessful—it was &quot;incapable of actual flight&quot;, unlike the engines designed by Whittle and Ohain. The question of the Coandă-1910 being the first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved, supporting Stine&#x27;s view: &quot;Whether Henri Coanda built the first true jet will probably be argued interminably.&quot;

In the 2000s, Dan Antoniu and other Romanian aviation experts investigated existing photographs of the Coandă-1910, leading them to believe that the aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished, that it was exhibited with many improvisations. Antoniu published &quot;Henri Coandă and his technical work during 1906–1918&quot;, a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to Coandă filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy. For instance, Antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the Clergét engine appeared free; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to the turbine as described in the patent, and there were no heat shields for crew protection. As well, the central attachment of the tubular struts holding the wings to the fuselage, with mere collars secured with screws, was judged by Antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take-off or landing because of the &quot;considerable loads on the struts&quot;. The X-shaped empennage was covered at high angles by the horizontal stabiliser making it unusable, and any high-speed taxi would put the machine in danger of a nose-over.
==Memorials and models==

A full-size replica of the Coandă-1910, built in 2001, is displayed in Bucharest at the National Military Museum, and a scale model is displayed in the French Air and Space Museum at Paris – Le Bourget Airport. At the site of the historic Issy-les-Moulineaux airfield, a large plaque lists the three pioneers of flight most closely associated with the airfield: Louis Blériot, Alberto Santos-Dumont and Henri Farman. Later, a plaque honouring Coandă and Romanian aviation engineer Traian Vuia was placed on a nearby building under the auspices of the mayor of Issy-les-Moulineaux, &quot;L&#x27;Aéroclub de France&quot;, and the Romanian Association for Aviation History.

Construction on a full-sized functional replica of the plane began in March 2010 at Craiova, Romania, by a team of engineers and former test pilots from I.R.Av. Craiova. The replica is based on plans that Coandă reworked in 1965 because the 1910 plans were lost. It uses metal for the fuselage rather than wood, and its intended engine is a true jet, the Motorlet M-701, made for the 1960s-era Aero L-29 Delfín military trainer.

In October 2010 the National Bank of Romania issued a commemorative silver coin for the centennial of the building of the first jet aircraft. The 10-lei piece is intended for coin collectors, with the official purchase price set at 220 lei. It represents the aircraft on the obverse side and a portrait of Coandă on the reverse, including Romanian words which translate to &quot;first jet aircraft&quot;. The same month the philatelic section of the Romanian Post, &quot;Romfilatelia&quot;, produced a limited edition philatelic folder and a stamp commemorating the centennial of jet aircraft. The stamp presents a modern internal schema of the Coandă-1910, a drawing of the injectors and burners, and a quote from Gustave Eiffel: &quot;This boy was born 30 if not 50 years too early&quot;. At the European Parliament in December, president Jerzy Buzek opened a centennial exhibition celebrating the building and testing of the Coandă-1910.

<text>Rid of Me is the second studio album by the English singer-songwriter PJ Harvey, released on 26 April 1993 by Island Records, approximately one year after the release of her critically acclaimed debut studio album &quot;Dry&quot; (1992). It marked a departure from Harvey&#x27;s previous songwriting, being more raw and aggressive than its predecessor.

The songs on &quot;Rid of Me&quot; were performed by Harvey&#x27;s eponymous trio, consisting of Harvey on guitar and vocals, Rob Ellis on drums and backing vocals, and Steve Vaughan on bass guitar. Most of the songs on the album were recorded by Steve Albini, and it was the last album they recorded as a trio before disbanding in late 1993. &quot;Rid of Me&quot; was met with critical acclaim, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 1990s and of all time, ranking at number 153 on the 2020 version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (up from 406 on the list&#x27;s previous edition).

==Background and history==
Harvey&#x27;s first two studio albums were recorded in quick succession and their histories intertwine. In October 1991, she released her debut single &quot;Dress&quot;. She signed a recording contract with indie record label Too Pure and relocated to London with her bandmates. Almost immediately after the single&#x27;s release, she began to receive serious positive attention from music critics in both the UK and United States. This led to several major record labels vying to sign her. Harvey was initially reluctant to sign to a major label fearing she might lose artistic control of her music, but eventually decided to sign with Island Records in February 1992. A month later, Too Pure released her debut studio album &quot;Dry&quot;, containing both &quot;Dress&quot; and &quot;Sheela-Na-Gig&quot;, her second single. Island would later distribute &quot;Dry&quot; under its Indigo imprint.

The band toured extensively in the UK and US to support &quot;Dry&quot;. Harvey turned down an offer to play the Lollapalooza festival in the summer of 1992, but did play the Reading Festival that August. By this time, non-stop touring had begun to take its toll on Harvey&#x27;s health. She suffered from what has been described as a nervous breakdown, brought on by a number of factors including exhaustion, poor eating habits, and the break-up of a relationship. Making matters worse, Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, where she had been accepted for study, refused to hold her place for her any longer. She left her London apartment and retreated to her native Dorset. While recuperating in October 1992, she worked on the songs that would appear on &quot;Rid of Me&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==

Structurally, Harvey continued to complicate her songwriting by utilising &quot;strangely skewed time signatures and twisty song structures&quot;, resulting in songs that &quot;tilt toward performance art&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lyrics have been widely interpreted as being feminist in nature. Harvey, however, repeatedly denied a feminist agenda in her songwriting, stating &quot;I don’t even think of myself as being female half the time. When I&#x27;m writing songs I never write with gender in mind. I write about people&#x27;s relationships to each other. I&#x27;m fascinated with things that might be considered repulsive or embarrassing. I like feeling unsettled, unsure.&quot; Some of the lyrics were inspired by her personal experiences. The title track, for instance, was admittedly influenced by one of Harvey&#x27;s relationships coming to an end. When told by an interviewer that &quot;Rid of Me&quot; sounded psychotic, she replied that she wrote the song &quot;at my illest&quot; and added &quot;I was almost psychotic&quot; at the time. But, she made it clear that not all of the lyrics were to be read autobiographically, saying &quot;I would have to be 40 and very worn out to have lived through everything I write about&quot;.

The album also includes a cover version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. Harvey&#x27;s mother and father, both Dylan fans, had suggested that she record the track.

==Recording==
In the late fall of 1992 the trio embarked on a short US tour. When the tour concluded in December they stayed in America to record their new album at the secluded Pachyderm Recording Studios in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Harvey chose Chicago musician and sound engineer Steve Albini to record the album. Harvey had admired Albini&#x27;s distinctively raw recordings of bands like Pixies, Slint, the Breeders and the Jesus Lizard.

The recording session took place over a two-week period, but according to Harvey the bulk of the recording was done in three days. Most of the songs were played live in the studio. Harvey spoke highly of Albini&#x27;s recording, stating, &quot;He&#x27;s the only person I know that can record a drum kit and it sounds like you&#x27;re standing in front of a drum kit. It doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s gone through a recording process or it&#x27;s coming out of speakers. You can feel the sound he records, and that is why I wanted to work with him, &#x27;cause all I ever wanted is for us to be recorded and to sound like we do when we&#x27;re playing together in a room&quot;.

She also gave insight into his recording methods, saying &quot;The way that some people think of producing is to sort of help you to arrange or contributing or playing instruments, he does none of that. He just sets up his microphones in a completely different way from which I&#x27;ve ever seen anyone set up mics before, and that was astonishing. He&#x27;d have them on the floor, on the walls, on the windows, on the ceiling, twenty feet away from where you were sitting... He&#x27;s very good at getting the right atmosphere to get the best take.&quot;

The song &quot;Man Size Sextet&quot; was not recorded by Albini. It was instead produced by Harvey, Rob Ellis, and Head.

==Artwork==
The cover of the album depicts Harvey topless and swinging her drenched hair into the air. The photo was captured by Harvey&#x27;s friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz, and was taken in Mochnacz&#x27;s bathroom in her flat in Bristol. Due to the small size of the room, she had to place her camera against the wall opposite Harvey and could not look through the camera&#x27;s viewfinder. The photo was taken in total darkness and only illuminated by the split-second flash.

When the photo was delivered to Island Records, Mochnacz was told that the imperfections in the picture (such as the water drops on the wall and the house plant) could be removed. She protested this decision, responding, &quot;It&#x27;s supposed to be like that – It&#x27;s part of the picture&quot;.

==Release and critical reception==

&quot;Rid of Me&quot; was released on 26 April 1993 in the United Kingdom and on 4 May 1993 in the United States, and was met with widespread critical acclaim. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; raved that &quot;No other British artist is so aggressively exploring the dark side of human nature, or its illogical black humour; no other British artist possesses the nerve, let alone the talent, to conjure up its soundtrack.&quot; Veteran UK disc jockey (DJ) and radio presenter John Peel, a supporter of Harvey since the beginning of her career, added &quot;You&#x27;re initially so taken aback by what you&#x27;re hearing. But you go back again and again and it implants itself on your consciousness.&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called Harvey &quot;A talent and a singular voice that demands to be heard.&quot; Evelyn McDonnell of &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that Harvey made it a point to &quot;confound expectations and stereotypes&quot;. The album also drew attention from more established musicians. Elvis Costello, for example, commented that a lot of Harvey&#x27;s songs &quot;seem to be about blood and fucking&quot;, a statement Harvey disagreed with.
Steve Albini&#x27;s production of the record proved controversial. Critics were divided over whether his recording complemented Harvey&#x27;s voice or buried it. On the positive side, it was written that &quot;Albini deftly balances heavy feedback and distortion with unexpected quiet breaks, making this release more musically diverse – and ultimately more satisfying – than PJ Harvey&#x27;s debut.&quot; But others considered the recording too harsh, saying &quot;Steve Albini&#x27;s deliberately crude production leaves everything minimal and rough, as if the whole album were recorded in somebody&#x27;s basement, with the drums set up in a bathroom to clatter as chaotically as possible.&quot; Another review called it simply &quot;a trial to endure&quot;. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine tried to reconcile Albini&#x27;s production with Harvey&#x27;s songs. He admitted the album has a &quot;bloodless, abrasive edge&quot; that leaves &quot;absolutely no subtleties in the music&quot;, but theorises that Albini&#x27;s recordings &quot;may be the aural embodiment of the tortured lyrics, and therefore a supremely effective piece of performance art, but it also makes &quot;Rid of Me&quot; a difficult record to meet halfway.&quot;

Harvey herself was pleased with the result. &quot;I do everything for myself primarily,&quot; she said, &quot;and I was happy with it. I don&#x27;t really listen when people say good things about my work because I tend to not give myself praise about anything. But I was really pleased with &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. For that period of my life, it was perfect. Well, it wasn&#x27;t perfect but as near to as I could get at that time&quot;. She remained friends with Albini afterward, finding in him a kindred spirit. &quot;People read things in and make him what they want him to be,&quot; Harvey said. &quot;He&#x27;s the only other person I know that that happens to besides myself. People have a very specific idea of what I am – some kind of ax-wielding, man-eating Vampira – and I&#x27;m not that at all. I&#x27;m almost the complete opposite.&quot;

The album yielded two singles: &quot;50ft Queenie&quot; and &quot;Man-Size&quot;. The music videos for both songs were directed by Maria Mochnacz. &quot;50ft Queenie&quot; was named a buzzworthy video by MTV in the Spring of 1993.

===Legacy and impact===

&quot;Rid of Me&quot; is regarded as an iconic album within alternative music. In 2016, Zach Schonfeld of &quot;Stereogum&quot; dubbed it not just one of the alternative era&#x27;s &quot;greatest [and] scariest rock albums,&quot; but that &quot;of any era.&quot; In 2022, it was included on an &quot;Alternative Press&quot; list titled &quot;20 albums that paved the way for alternative as we know it&quot;. The following year, &quot;Louder Sound&quot;″s Emma Johnston saw that, in &quot;Rid of Me&quot;″s wake, the genre&#x27;s &quot;host of uncompromised confessionals&quot; drew inspiration from it. 

&quot;Rid of Me&quot; has impacted and garnered admiration from various musicians in the years since its release. In 2005, &quot;Spin&quot;″s Caryn Ganz saw that the way for the band Elastica and musician Karen O was paved by the album&#x27;s &quot;poetically demented blues&quot;. In 2009, BBC Music&#x27;s Mike Diver wrote of its part in ushering its era&#x27;s wave of &quot;angst-ridden&quot; women songwriters in. He saw &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, the 1995 album by singer Alanis Morissette, bear the imprint of Harvey&#x27;s &quot;bare-all performances&quot; on &quot;Rid of Me&quot;.

Some of Harvey&#x27;s peers have expressed their admiration for the album. Reflecting on her band Hole&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Live Through This&quot; (1994) in a 2014 &quot;Spin&quot; interview, musician Courtney Love admitted to seeing &quot;Rid of Me&quot; as &quot;a far superior record&quot; compared to theirs. Kurt Cobain was an admirer of the album, and according to Steve Albini, who produced &quot;In Utero&quot;: &quot;I sent them a copy of &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. Kurt told me very specifically that he thought Polly’s voice was great on those recordings. He really liked the way her singing came across. He was a fan.&quot;

==Tour==
Harvey and her band toured in the spring and summer of 1993 to support &quot;Rid of Me&quot;. The tour began in the UK in May and moved to America in June. Maria Mochnacz documented aspects of the tour, and her footage was used to create the long-form video &quot;Reeling with PJ Harvey&quot; (1994). Harvey&#x27;s concert setlist drew from &quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;Rid of Me&quot;, but also highlighted songs that did not appear on either of those recordings. For example, she regularly performed a cover version of Willie Dixon&#x27;s 1961 song &quot;Wang Dang Doodle&quot;. One reviewer praised Harvey&#x27;s version and called it &quot;perhaps the definitive version of that song.&quot;

In August, they finished the tour with a string of dates opening for the Irish rock band U2 during their Zooropa tour. In the fall the trio started to disintegrate, first with the departure of Ellis and then Vaughan shortly afterward. By September, Harvey was performing as a solo artist.

==Accolades==
&quot;Rid of Me&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number three and quickly went silver, and enjoyed a top-30 hit in the single &quot;50 ft. Queenie&quot;. In the US it generated major college-radio airplay and expanded her growing fan base. It also won considerable critical acclaim and featured in various top ten album-of-the-year lists in respectable press, like &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Vox&quot; and &quot;Select&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; gave it a rare ten out of ten review rating. &quot;Rid of Me&quot; was shortlisted for the 1993 Mercury Prize, but lost to Suede. If anything its critical stature has grown over the years—&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; selected it as one of the Essential Recordings of the 90s, and in 2005, &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it the ninth greatest album of 1985–2005 after it had ranked it only the 37th greatest album of the 90s after &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; at number 3. In 2003, the album was ranked number 405 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; the list&#x27;s 2012 edition had it ranked 406th. In 2011, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked Rid of Me as the 25th greatest album of the 90s. In 2014, the album placed tenth on the Alternative Nation site&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Underrated 90’s Alternative Rock Albums&quot; list. The title track was ranked #194 on the 2021 version of Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

<text>Differential rotation is seen when different parts of a rotating object move with different angular velocities (or rates of rotation) at different latitudes and/or depths of the body and/or in time. This indicates that the object is not rigid. In fluid objects, such as accretion disks, this leads to shearing. Galaxies and protostars usually show differential rotation; examples in the Solar System include the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn.

Around the year 1610, Galileo Galilei observed sunspots and calculated the rotation of the Sun. In 1630, Christoph Scheiner reported that the Sun had different rotational periods at the poles and at the equator, in good agreement with modern values. 

== Cause ==
Stars and planets rotate in the first place because conservation of angular momentum turns random drifting of parts of the molecular cloud that they form from into rotating motion as they coalesce. Given this average rotation of the whole body, internal differential rotation is caused by convection in stars which is a movement of mass, due to steep temperature gradients from the core outwards. This mass carries a portion of the star&#x27;s angular momentum, thus redistributing the angular velocity, possibly even far enough out for the star to lose angular velocity in stellar winds. Differential rotation thus depends on temperature differences in adjacent regions.

== Measurement ==
There are many ways to measure and calculate differential rotation in stars to see if different latitudes have different angular velocities. The most obvious is tracking spots on the stellar surface.

By doing helioseismological measurements of solar &quot;p-modes&quot; it is possible to deduce the differential rotation. The Sun has very many acoustic modes that oscillate in the interior simultaneously, and the inversion of their frequencies can yield the rotation of the solar interior. This varies with both depth and (especially) latitude.

The broadened shapes of absorption lines in the optical spectrum depend on vrotsin(i), where &quot;i&quot; is the angle between the line of sight and the rotation axis, permitting the study of the rotational velocity&#x27;s line-of-sight component vrot. This is calculated from Fourier transforms of the line shapes, using equation (2) below for vrot at the equator and poles. See also plot 2.
Solar differential rotation is also seen in magnetograms, images showing the strength and location of solar magnetic fields.

It may be possible to measure the differential of stars that regularly emit flares of radio emission. Using 7 years of observations of the M9 ultracool dwarf TVLM 513-46546, astronomers were able to measure subtle changes in the arrival times of the radio waves. These measurements demonstrate that the radio waves can arrive 1–2 seconds sooner or later in a systematic fashion over a number of years. On the Sun, active regions are common sources of radio flares. The researchers concluded that this effect was best explained by active regions emerging and disappearing at different latitudes, such as occurs during the solar sunspot cycle.

== Effects ==
Gradients in angular rotation caused by angular momentum redistribution within the convective layers of a star are expected to be a main driver for generating the large-scale magnetic field, through magneto-hydrodynamical (dynamo) mechanisms in the outer envelopes. The interface between these two regions is where angular rotation gradients are strongest and thus where dynamo processes are expected to be most efficient.

The inner differential rotation is one part of the mixing processes in stars, mixing the materials and the heat/energy of the stars.

Differential rotation affects stellar optical absorption-line spectra through line broadening caused by lines being differently Doppler-shifted across the stellar surface.

Solar differential rotation causes shear at the so-called tachocline. This is a region where rotation changes from differential in the convection zone to nearly solid-body rotation in the interior, at 0.71 solar radii from the center.

== Surface level ==
For observed sunspots, the differential rotation can be calculated as:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the rotation rate at the equator, and formula_3 is the difference in angular velocity between pole and equator, called the strength of the rotational shear. formula_4 is the heliographic latitude, measured from the equator.
*The reciprocal of the rotational shear formula_5 is the lap time, i.e. the time it takes for the equator to do a full lap more than the poles.
*The relative differential rotation rate is the ratio of the rotational shear to the rotation rate at the equator: formula_6
*The Doppler rotation rate in the Sun (measured from Doppler-shifted absorption lines), can be approximated as: formula_7 where is the co-latitude (measured from the poles).

== Examples ==
=== Sun ===
On the Sun, the study of oscillations revealed that rotation is roughly constant within the whole radiative interior and variable with radius and latitude within the convective envelope. The Sun has an equatorial rotation speed of ~2 km/s; its differential rotation implies that the angular velocity decreases with increased latitude. The poles make one rotation every 34.3 days and the equator every 25.05 days, as measured relative to distant stars (sidereal rotation).

The highly turbulent nature of solar convection and anisotropies induced by rotation complicate the dynamics of modeling. Molecular dissipation scales on the Sun are at least six orders of magnitude smaller than the depth of the convective envelope. A direct numerical simulation of solar convection would have to resolve this entire range of scales in each of the three dimensions. Consequently, all solar differential rotation models must involve some approximations regarding momentum and heat transport by turbulent motions that are not explicitly computed. Thus, modeling approaches can be classified as either mean-field models or large-eddy simulations according to the approximations.

=== Disk galaxies ===

Disk galaxies do not rotate like solid bodies, but rather rotate differentially. The rotation speed as a function of radius is called a rotation curve, and is often interpreted as a measurement of the mass profile of a galaxy, as:
formula_8
where
* formula_9 is the rotation speed at radius formula_10
* formula_11 is the total mass enclosed within radius formula_10

<text>A flying wing is a tailless fixed-wing aircraft that has no definite fuselage, with its crew, payload, fuel, and equipment housed inside the main wing structure. A flying wing may have various small protuberances such as pods, nacelles, blisters, booms, or vertical stabilizers.

Similar aircraft designs, that are not technically flying wings, are sometimes casually referred to as such. These types include blended wing body aircraft and lifting body aircraft, which have a fuselage and no definite wings.

A pure flying wing is theoretically the lowest-drag design configuration for a fixed wing aircraft. However, because it lacks conventional stabilizing surfaces and the associated control surfaces, in its purest form the flying wing suffers from being unstable and difficult to control.

The basic flying wing configuration became an object of significant study during the 1920s, often in conjunction with other tailless designs. In the Second World War, both Nazi Germany and the Allies made advances in developing flying wings. Military interest in the flying wing waned during the 1950s with the development of supersonic aircraft, but was renewed in the 1980s due to their potential for stealth technology. This approach eventually led to the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. There has been continual interest in using it in the large transport roles for cargo or passengers. Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Armstrong Whitworth have undertaken design studies on flying wing airliners; however, no such airliners have yet been built.

The flying wing concept is mostly suited to subsonic aircraft. No supersonic flying wing has ever been built.

==Design==

===Overview===
A flying wing is an aeroplane that has no definite fuselage or tailplane, with its crew, payload, fuel, and equipment housed inside the main wing structure. A flying wing may have various small protuberances such as pods, nacelles, blisters, booms, or vertical stabilizers.
A clean flying wing is sometimes presented as theoretically the most aerodynamically efficient (lowest drag) design configuration for a fixed wing aircraft. It also would offer high structural efficiency for a given wing depth, leading to light weight and high fuel efficiency.

Because it lacks conventional stabilizing surfaces and the associated control surfaces, in its purest form the flying wing suffers from the inherent disadvantages of being unstable and difficult to control. These compromises are difficult to reconcile, and efforts to do so can reduce or even negate the expected advantages of the flying wing design, such as reductions in weight and drag. Moreover, solutions may produce a final design that is still too unsafe for certain uses, such as commercial aviation.

Further difficulties arise from the problem of fitting the pilot, engines, flight equipment, and payload all within the depth of the wing section. Other known problems with the flying wing design relate to pitch and yaw. Pitch issues are discussed in the article on tailless aircraft. The problems of yaw are discussed below.

===Engineering design===
A wing that is made deep enough to contain the pilot, engines, fuel, undercarriage and other necessary equipment will have an increased frontal area, when compared with a conventional wing and long-thin fuselage. This can actually result in higher drag and thus lower efficiency than a conventional design. Typically the solution adopted in this case is to keep the wing reasonably thin, and the aircraft is then fitted with an assortment of blisters, pods, nacelles, fins, and so forth to accommodate all the needs of a practical aircraft.

The problem becomes more acute at supersonic speeds, where the drag of a thick wing rises sharply and it is essential for the wing to be made thin. No supersonic flying wing has ever been built.

===Directional stability===
For any aircraft to fly without constant correction it must have directional stability in yaw.

Flying wings lack anywhere to attach an efficient vertical stabilizer or fin. Any fin must attach directly on to the rear part of the wing, giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic centre, which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large. Such a large fin has weight and drag penalties, and can negate the advantages of the flying wing. The problem can be minimized by increasing the wing sweepback and placing twin fins outboard near the tips, as for example in a low-aspect-ratio delta wing, but given the corresponding reduction in efficiency many flying wings have gentler sweepback and consequently have, at best, marginal stability.

The aspect ratio of a swept wing as seen in the direction of the airflow depends on the yaw angle relative to the airflow. Yaw increases the aspect ratio of the leading wing and reduces that of the trailing one. With sufficient sweep-back, differential induced drag resulting from the tip vortices and crossflow is sufficient to naturally re-align the aircraft.

A complementary approach uses twist or wash-out, reducing the angle of attack towards the wing tips, together with a swept-back wing planform. The Dunne D.5 incorporated this principle and its designer J. W. Dunne published it in 1913. The wash-out reduces lift at the tips to create a bell-shaped distribution curve across the span, described by Ludwig Prandtl in 1933, and this can be used to optimise weight and drag for a given amount of lift.

Another solution is to angle or crank the wing tip sections downward with significant anhedral, increasing the area at the rear of the aircraft when viewed from the side. When combined with sweepback and washout, it can resolve another problem. With a conventional elliptical lift distribution the downgoing elevon causes increased induced drag that causes the aircraft to yaw out of the turn (&quot;adverse yaw&quot;). Washout angles the net aerodynamic vector (lift plus drag) forwards as the angle of attack reduces and, in the extreme, this can create a net forward thrust. The restoration of outer lift by the elevon creates a slight induced thrust for the rear (outer) section of the wing during the turn. This vector essentially pulls the trailing wing forward to cause &quot;proverse yaw&quot;, creating a naturally coordinated turn. In his 1913 lecture to the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, Dunne described the effect as &quot;tangential gain&quot;. The existence of proverse yaw was not proved until NASA flew its Prandtl-D tailless demonstrator.

===Yaw control===
In some flying wing designs, any stabilizing fins and associated control rudders would be too far forward to have much effect, thus alternative means for yaw control are sometimes provided.

One solution to the control problem is differential drag: the drag near one wing tip is artificially increased, causing the aircraft to yaw in the direction of that wing. Typical methods include:
* Split ailerons. The top surface moves up while the lower surface moves down. Splitting the aileron on one side induces yaw by creating a differential air brake effect.
* Spoilers. A spoiler surface in the upper wing skin is raised, to disrupt the airflow and increase drag. This effect is generally accompanied by a loss of lift, which must be compensated for either by the pilot or by design features that automatically compensate.
* Spoilerons. An upper surface spoiler that also acts to reduce lift (equivalent to deflecting an aileron upwards), so causing the aircraft to bank in the direction of the turn—the angle of roll causes the wing lift to act in the direction of turn, reducing the amount of drag required to turn the aircraft&#x27;s longitudinal axis.

A consequence of the differential drag method is that if the aircraft maneuvers frequently then it will frequently create drag. So flying wings are at their best when cruising in still air: in turbulent air or when changing course, the aircraft may be less efficient than a conventional design.

===Related designs===
Some related aircraft that are not strictly flying wings have been described as such.

Some types, such as the Northrop Flying Wing (NX-216H), still have a tail stabilizer mounted on tail booms, although they lack a fuselage.

Many hang gliders and microlight aircraft are tailless. Although sometimes referred to as flying wings, these types carry the pilot (and engine where fitted) below the wing structure rather than inside it, and so are not true flying wings.

An aircraft of sharply swept delta planform and deep centre section represents a borderline case between flying wing, blended wing body, and/or lifting body configurations.

==History==

===Early research===
The concept of the flying wing was born on 16 February 1876 when French engineers Alphonse Pénaud and Paul Gauchot filed a patent for an &quot;aero-plane or flying aircraft&quot; powered by two propellers and with all the characteristics of a flying wing as we know it today.

Tailless aircraft have been experimented with since the earliest attempts to fly. Britain&#x27;s J. W. Dunne was an early pioneer, his swept-wing biplane and monoplane designs displayed inherent stability as early as 1910. His work directly influenced several other designers, including G. T. R. Hill, who developed a series of experimental tailless aircraft designs, collectively known as the Westland-Hill Pterodactyls, during the 1920s and early 1930s. Despite attempts to pursue orders from the Aviation Ministry, the Pterodactyl programme was ultimately cancelled during the mid 1930s before any order for the Mk. VI was issued.

Germany&#x27;s Hugo Junkers patented his own wing-only air transport concept in 1910, seeing it as a natural solution to the problem of building an airliner large enough to carry a reasonable passenger load and enough fuel to cross the Atlantic in regular service. He believed that the flying wing&#x27;s potentially large internal volume and low drag made it an obvious design for this role. His deep-chord monoplane wing was incorporated in the otherwise conventional Junkers J 1 in December 1915. In 1919 he started work on his &quot;Giant&quot; JG1 design, intended to seat passengers within a thick wing, but two years later the Allied Aeronautical Commission of Control ordered the incomplete JG1 destroyed for exceeding postwar size limits on German aircraft. Junkers conceived futuristic flying wings for up to 1,000 passengers; the nearest this came to realization was in the 1931 Junkers G.38 34-seater &quot;Grossflugzeug&quot; airliner, which featured a large thick-chord wing providing space for fuel, engines, and two passenger cabins. However, it still required a short fuselage to house the crew and additional passengers.

The Soviet Boris Ivanovich Cheranovsky began testing tailless flying wing gliders in 1924. After the 1920s, Soviet designers such as Cheranovsky worked independently and in secret under Stalin. With significant breakthrough in materials and construction methods, aircraft such as the BICh-3, BICh-14, BICh-7A became possible. Men like Chizhevskij and Antonov also came into the spotlight of the Communist Party by designing aircraft like the tailless BOK-5 (Chizhevskij) and OKA-33 (the first ever built by Antonov) which were designated as &quot;motorized gliders&quot; due to their similarity to popular gliders of the time. The BICh-11, developed by Cheranovsky in 1932, competed with the Horten brothers H1 and Adolf Galland at the Ninth Glider Competitions in 1933, but was not demonstrated in the 1936 summer Olympics in Berlin.

In Germany, Alexander Lippisch worked first on tailless types before progressively moving to flying wings, while the Horten brothers developed a series of flying wing gliders through the 1930s. The H1 glider was flown with partial success in 1933, and the subsequent H2 flown successfully in both glider and powered variants.

In the United States, from the 1930s Jack Northrop independently worked on his own designs. The Northrop N-1M, a scale prototype for a long-range bomber, first flew in 1940. In 1941 Northrop was awarded a development contract to build 2 examples of the YB-35 flying wing, a very large 4 engined flying wing with a span of 172&#x27;. Development and construction of this aircraft continued throughout World War II.

Other 1930s examples of true flying wings include Frenchman Charles Fauvel&#x27;s AV3 glider of 1933 and the American Freel Flying Wing glider flown in 1937. featuring a self-stabilizing airfoil on a straight wing.

===Second World War===

During the Second World War, aerodynamic issues became sufficiently understood for work on a range of production-representative prototypes to commence. In Nazi Germany, the Horten brothers were keen proponents of the flying wing configuration, developing their own designs around it - uniquely for the time using Prandtl&#x27;s birdlike &quot;bell-shaped lift distribution&quot;. One such aircraft they produced was the Horten H.IV glider, which was produced in low numbers between 1941 and 1943. Several other late-war German military designs were based on the flying wing concept, or variations of it, as a proposed solution to extend the range of otherwise very short-range of aircraft powered by early jet engines. 
The Horten Ho 229 jet fighter prototype first flew in 1944. It combined a flying wing, or &quot;Nurflügel&quot;, design with a pair of Junkers Jumo 004 jet engines in its second, or &quot;V2&quot; (V for &quot;Versuch&quot;) prototype airframe; as such, it was the world&#x27;s first pure flying wing to be powered by twin jet engines, being first reportedly flown in March 1944. V2 was piloted by Erwin Ziller, who was killed when a flameout in one of its engines led to a crash. Plans were made to produce the type as the Gotha Go 229 during the closing stages of the conflict. Despite intentions to develop the Go 229 and an improved Go P.60 for several roles, including as a night fighter, no Gotha-built Go 229s or P.60s were ever completed. The unflown, nearly completed surviving &quot;V3,&quot; or third prototype was captured by American forces and sent back for study; it has ended up in storage at the Smithsonian Institution.

The Allies also made several relevant advances in the field using a conventional elliptical lift distribution with vertical tail surfaces. During December 1942, Northrop flew the N-9M, a one-third scale development aircraft for a proposed long-range bomber; several were produced, all but one were scrapped following the bomber programme&#x27;s termination. In Britain, the Baynes Bat glider was flown during wartime; it was a one-third scale experimental aircraft intended to test out the configuration for potential conversion of tanks into temporary gliders.

The British Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52G of 1944 was a glider test bed for a proposed large flying wing airliner capable of serving transatlantic routes. The A.W.52G was later followed up by the Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52, an all-metal jet-powered model capable of high speeds for the era; great attention was paid to laminar flow. First flown on 13 November 1947, the A.W.52 yielded disappointing results; the first prototype crashed without loss of life on 30 May 1949, the occasion being the first emergency use of an ejection seat by a British pilot. The second A.W.52 remained flying with the Royal Aircraft Establishment until 1954.

===Postwar===
Projects continued to examine the flying wing during the postwar era. The work on the YB-35 long-range bomber begun in 1941, had continued throughout the war with pre-production machines flying in 1946. This was superseded the next year by conversion of the type to jet power as the YB-49 of 1947.

Initially, the design did not offer a great advantage in range compared to slower piston bomber designs, primarily due to the high fuel consumption of the early turbojets, however, it broke new ground in speed for a large aircraft.

On February 9, 1949, it was flown from Edwards Air Force Base in California, to Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, D.C., for President Harry Truman&#x27;s air power demonstration. The flight was made in four hours and 20 minutes, setting a transcontinental speed record. The YB-49 presented some minor lateral stability problems that were being rectified by a new autopilot system, when the bomber version was cancelled in favour of the much larger but slower B-36. A reconnaissance version continued in development for some time but the aircraft did not enter production.

In the Soviet Union, the BICh-26, became one of the first attempts to produce a supersonic jet flying wing aircraft in 1948; aviation author Bill Gunston referred to the BICh-26 as being ahead of its time. However, the aeroplane was not accepted by the Soviet military and the design died with Cheranovsky.

Several other nations also opted to undertake flying wing projects. Turkey was one such country, the Turk Hava Kurumu Ucak Fabrikasi producing the THK-13 tailless glider during 1948. Multiple British manufacturers also explored the concept at this time. Early proposals for the Avro Vulcan, a nuclear-armed strategic bomber designed by Roy Chadwick, also explored several flying wing arrangements, although the final design had a fuselage.

There has been continual interest in the flying wing for large transport roles for cargo or passengers. Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Armstrong Whitworth have undertaken design studies on flying wing airliners; however, no such airliners have yet been built.

Following the arrival of supersonic aircraft during the 1950s, military interest in the flying wing was quickly curtailed, as the concept of adopting a thick wing that accommodated the crew and equipment directly conflicted with the optimal thin wing for supersonic flight.

Interest in flying wings was renewed in the 1980s due to their potentially low radar reflection cross-sections. Stealth technology relies on shapes that reflect radar waves only in certain directions, thus making the aircraft hard to detect unless the radar receiver is at a specific position relative to the aircraft—a position that changes continuously as the aircraft moves. This approach eventually led to the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, a flying wing stealth bomber. In this case, the aerodynamic advantages of the flying wing are not the primary reasons for the design&#x27;s adoption. However, modern computer-controlled fly-by-wire systems allow for many of the aerodynamic drawbacks of the flying wing to be minimized, making for an efficient and effectively stable long-range bomber.

Due to the practical need for a deep wing, the flying wing concept is mostly adopted for subsonic aircraft. There has been continual interest in using it in the large transport role where the wing is deep enough to hold cargo or passengers. A number of companies, including Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Armstrong Whitworth, have undertaken design studies on flying wing airliners to date; however, no such airliners have yet been built as of 2023.

The bi-directional flying wing is a variable-geometry concept comprising a long-span subsonic wing and a short-span supersonic wing, joined in the form of an unequal cross. Proposed in 2011, the low-speed wing would have a thick, rounded airfoil able to contain the payload and a long span for high efficiency, while the high-speed wing would have a thin, sharp-edged airfoil and a shorter span for low drag at supersonic speed. The craft would take off and land with the low-speed wing across the airflow, then rotate a quarter-turn so that the high-speed wing faces the airflow for supersonic travel. NASA has funded a study of the proposal. The design is claimed to offer low wave drag, high subsonic efficiency and reduced sonic boom.

Since the end of the Cold War, numerous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) featuring the flying wing have been produced. Nations have typically used such platforms for aerial reconnaissance; such UAVs include the Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel and the Northrop Grumman Tern. Civilian companies have also experimented with UAVs, such as the Facebook Aquila, as atmospheric satellites. Various prototype unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) have been produced, including the Dassault nEUROn, the Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B, the DRDO Ghatak, DRDO SWIFT and the BAE Systems Taranis.

<text>The M60 motorway, Manchester Ring Motorway or Manchester Outer Ring Road is an orbital motorway in North West England. Built over a 40-year period, it passes through all of Greater Manchester&#x27;s metropolitan boroughs except for Wigan and Bolton. Most of Manchester is encompassed within the motorway, except for the southernmost part of the city (Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport) which is served by the M56.

The M60 is long and was renamed the M60 in 1998, with parts of the M62, M66 and all of the M63 being amalgamated into the new route, and the circle completed in 2000. The road forms part of the unsigned Euroroutes E20 and E22 from junctions 12 to 18.

In 2008, the M60 was proposed as a cordon for congestion charging in Greater Manchester, although this was rejected in a referendum relating to the Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund.

==History==
The M60 was developed by connecting and consolidating the existing motorway sections of the M63, M62, and an extended M66. It came into existence as the M60 in 1998, followed by the completion of the eastern side (junctions 19–23) opening in October 2000.

The original plan called for a completely new motorway, but policy change led to the plan which created the current motorway. As soon as it opened, the motorway came close to its projected maximum volume on significant sections.

It is an orbital motorway, and in 2004, a section of the northern M60 was the UK&#x27;s busiest stretch of road, with an average of 181,000 vehicles per day using the stretch between junctions 16 and 17. Usually, the western side of the M25 motorway holds that distinction, but the M25&#x27;s figures at the time were lower than normal due to roadworks starting.

In 2006, the section between junctions 5 and 6 was widened from three to four lanes each way and the section between junctions 6 and 8 was widened from two to three lanes each way with an additional two-lane collector/distributor road on either side of the main carriageways. Access for junctions 6 to 8 is only from the collector/distributor road. Some of the junctions were extensively re-modelled. As part of the project, the A6144(M) motorway, which connected to the M60 at junction 8, was downgraded and lost its motorway status.

The Greater Manchester congestion charge which would have affected drivers only during peak times coming off the M60 towards Manchester was rejected by a referendum on 12 December 2008.

Work to upgrade two sections of the M60 to a managed motorway system had been planned to commence in 2013. This would have included a new lane from junction 12 to 15 and a new lane from junction 8 to 12 near the Trafford Centre. Both these projects were subsequently cancelled in favour of a new project that includes speed cameras on this section but no additional lane or hard-shoulder running. An &#x27;environmental assessment&#x27; was cited as the reason an additional lane was not provided. A combined approach was initiated in 2014, comprising managed motorway system and lane gain scheme. Work commenced in July 2014, and the full stretch of smart motorway became fully operational on 31 July 2018.

There are no motorway service areas on the M60. The closest service area is at Birch Services on the M62 heading eastwards.

== M60 genealogy ==

==Legislation==

Each motorway in England requires that a statutory instrument be published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these statutory instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is an incomplete list of statutory instruments relating to the route of the M60.
* Statutory Instrument 1988 No. 1708: M66 Motorway (Manchester Ring Road, Denton to Middleton Section) and Connecting Roads Scheme 1988 S.I. 1988/1708
* Statutory Instrument 1988 No. 1728: M66 Motorway (Middleton to the Lancashire/Yorkshire Motorway (M62) Section) and Connecting Roads Scheme 1988 S.I. 1988/1728
* Statutory Instrument 1993 No. 363: M66 Motorway (Manchester Outer Ring Road, Denton to Middleton Section) A663 Broadway All-Purpose Connecting Road Order 1993 S.I. 1993/363
* Statutory Instrument 1993 No. 364: M66 Motorway (Manchester Outer Ring Road, Denton to Middleton Section) and Connecting Roads Scheme 1988 Amendment Scheme 1993 S.I. 1993/364
* Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 2724: The M60 Motorway (Improvement Between Junctions 5 and 8) Connecting Roads Scheme 1999 S.I. 1999/2724
* Statutory Instrument 2002 No. 2403: The M60 Motorway (Junction 25) (Speed Limit) Regulations 2002 S.I. 2002/2403

==Junctions==
The junctions on the M60 are very closely spaced together, with an average distance of between junctions. The recommended junction spacing for motorways is every . By comparison, the M6 motorway has an average distance of between junctions.

The entire length of the M60 lies within the ceremonial county of Greater Manchester.
