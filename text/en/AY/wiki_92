<text>The Battle of Guilford Court House was fought on 15 March 1781 during the American Revolutionary War, near Greensboro, North Carolina. A 2,100-man British force under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis defeated Major General Nathanael Greene&#x27;s 4,500 Americans. The British Army suffered considerable casualties, with estimates as high as 27% of their total force. The battle was &quot;the largest and most hotly contested action&quot; in the American Revolution&#x27;s southern theater. Before the battle, the British had great success in conquering much of Georgia and South Carolina with the aid of strong Loyalist factions and thought that North Carolina might be within their grasp. The British were in the process of heavy recruitment in North Carolina when this battle put an end to their recruiting drive. The battle is commemorated at Guilford Courthouse National Military Park and associated Hoskins House Historic District.

In the wake of the battle, Greene moved into South Carolina. Cornwallis moved his army to Wilmington to rest and resupply. Later, Cornwallis chose to march into Virginia and attempt to link with roughly 3,500 men under British Major General Phillips and American turncoat Benedict Arnold. These decisions allowed Greene to unravel British control of the South, while leading Cornwallis to Yorktown, where he was forced to surrender to General George Washington and French Lieutenant General Comte de Rochambeau.

==Prelude==
On 18 January 1781 Lord Cornwallis learned he had lost one-quarter of his army at the Battle of Cowpens. Yet he was still determined to pursue General Nathanael Greene into North Carolina and destroy Greene&#x27;s army. According to Cornwallis, &quot;The loss of my light troops could only be remedied by the activity of the whole corps.&quot; At Ramsour&#x27;s Mill, Cornwallis burned his baggage train, except the wagons he needed to carry medical supplies, salt, ammunition, and the sick. In the words of Charles O&#x27;Hara, &quot;In this situation, without Baggage, necessaries, or Provisions of any sort...it was resolved to follow Greene&#x27;s army to the end of the World.&quot; 

As Cornwallis departed Ramsour&#x27;s Mill on 28 January, Greene sought to reunite his command but ordered Edward Carrington to prepare for possible retreat across the Dan River into Virginia. In Greene&#x27;s words, &quot;It is necessary we should take every possible precaution. But I am not without hopes of ruining Lord Cornwallis, if he persists in his mad scheme of pushing through the Country...&quot;

On 3 February, Greene joined Daniel Morgan&#x27;s Continentals at Trading Ford on the Yadkin River, and on 7 February, Lighthorse Harry Lee rendezvoused with the army at Guilford Court House. By 9 February, Greene commanded 2,036 men, 1,426 of whom were regular infantry, whereas Cornwallis had about 2,440 men, 2,000 of whom were regulars. The opponents began a &quot;Race to the Dan&quot;: Greene&#x27;s council of war recommended continuing the retreat, opting to fight at a future date and location. 

By 14 February, Greene&#x27;s army was safely across the Dan after a retreat that was, according to British commander Banastre Tarleton, &quot;judiciously designed and vigorously executed.&quot; Cornwallis was from his supply base at Camden, South Carolina. He established camp at Hillsborough and attempted to forage for supplies and recruit Tories. Though Greene&#x27;s army enjoyed an abundance of food in Halifax County, Virginia, Cornwallis found a &quot;scarcity of provisions,&quot; resorted to plundering the farms of the local inhabitants, and lost men &quot;...in consequence of their Straggling out of Camp in search of whiskey.&quot;

On 19 February, Greene sent Lee&#x27;s Legion on a reconnaissance mission south across the Dan. By then, according to Buchanan, &quot;Buford&#x27;s Massacre inflamed rebel passions. Pyle&#x27;s Massacre devastated Tory morale.&quot; On 22 February Greene moved his army south across the Dan. On 25 February, forced to abandon Hillsborough, Cornwallis moved his camp to the south of Alamance Creek between the Haw River and the Deep River. Greene camped on the north side of the creek, within of Cornwallis&#x27;s camp.

By 6 March Cornwallis&#x27;s men suffered from hunger. His men plundered Tory and Patriot inhabitants, and desertions rose, forcing Cornwallis to seek a definitive battle with Greene. Cornwallis had lost almost 400 men through disease, desertion or death, reducing his strength to about 2,000 men. On 10 March Greene was joined by North Carolina militia, led by John Butler and Thomas Eaton, and Virginia militia, led by Robert Lawson. On 12 March Greene marched his army of about 4,440, 1,762 of whom were Continentals, to Guilford Court House.

On 15 March Cornwallis, after learning of Greene&#x27;s location, marched down the road from New Garden toward Guilford Court House. The advance guard of both armies met near the Quaker New Garden Meeting House, west of Guilford Court House. Greene had sent Lee&#x27;s Legion and William Campbell&#x27;s Virginia riflemen to reconnoiter Cornwallis&#x27; camp. At 2 am the Patriots noticed Tarleton&#x27;s movements, and at 4 am Lee&#x27;s and Tarleton&#x27;s men made contact. Tarleton started a retreat, while suffering a musket wound to the right hand, and as Lee pursued, Lee came in contact with the British Guards, who forced Lee to retreat.

==Battle==
Greene had deployed his army in three lines. Greene&#x27;s first line was along a split-rail fence, where the New Camden road emerged from the woods. On the right was Butler&#x27;s regiment of 500 North Carolina militia, plus Charles Lynch&#x27;s 200 Virginia riflemen, William Washington&#x27;s 90 dragoons, and Robert Kirkwood&#x27;s 80 man Delaware Line. On the left was Eaton&#x27;s regiment of 500 North Carolina militia, along with William Campbell&#x27;s 200 riflemen, and Lee&#x27;s Legion of 75 horse and 82 foot. In the middle was a dual six-pounder battery led by Anthony Singleton.

Greene&#x27;s second line was behind the first: 1,200 Virginia militia, led by Robert Lawson and Edward Stevens. Greene&#x27;s third line was another to the right rear, in a clearing: 1,400 Continentals, including Isaac Huger&#x27;s Virginia Brigade, Otho Holland Williams&#x27;s Maryland Brigade, and Peter Jacquett&#x27;s Delaware Company. Between the Virginia and Maryland units was a battery of two six-pounders, led by Samuel Finley.

Cornwallis&#x27;s column appeared along the New Camden Road at 1:30 pm, and Singleton commenced firing his two six-pounders, while John McLeod&#x27;s Royal Artillery battery responded with three six-pounders. According to Buchanan, Cornwallis &quot;...did not know how many men Greene had. He was ignorant of the terrain too, he also lacked intelligence on Greene&#x27;s dispositions. Cornwallis &quot;...had marched hundreds of miles, had driven his army to rags and hunger...&quot;.

Cornwallis deployed the 33rd Foot and Royal Welsh Fusiliers on his left wing, led by James Webster, and supported by Charles O&#x27;Hara with his 2nd Guards Battalion, Grenadiers, and the Jägers. Cornwallis&#x27;s right wing, led by Alexander Leslie, included the 2nd Battalion of Fraser&#x27;s Highlanders and Hessian Regiment von Bose, supported by the 1st Guards Battalion. Tarleton&#x27;s British Legion Horse was in reserve, but Cornwallis lacked Tory auxiliaries.

The British moved forward. The North Carolina militia, according to Singleton, &quot;contrary to custom, behaved well for militia&quot; and fired their volley. Captain Dugald Stuart noted, &quot;One half of the Highlanders dropt on that spot.&quot; Thomas Saumarez called it a &quot;most galling and destructive fire.&quot; As the British advanced, Sergeant Roger Lamb noted, &quot;...within forty yards of the enemy&#x27;s line it was perceived that their whole line had their arms presented, and resting on a rail fence...They were taking aim with nice precision. At this awful moment, a general pause took place...then Colonel Webster rode forward in front of the 23rd regiment and said...&#x27;Come on, my brave Fuzileers.&#x27; This operated like an inspiring voice...&quot;.

As instructed by Greene, the North Carolina militia retired through Greene&#x27;s second line. The British now came under enfilading fire from the riflemen and Continentals on their flanks, forcing Cornwallis to order forward his supporting units. On Greene&#x27;s left, Lee&#x27;s Legion and Campbell&#x27;s Virginians retired in a northeasterly direction, instead of straight back, resulting in their fight with the Regiment von Bose and the 1st Guards Battalion—a backwoods fight a mile from the main fighting.

As the British moved through the woods, the contest reduced to small firefights as the British forced the Virginians back. Cornwallis, despite having a horse shot from under him, led the British clearing of the woods. The British then faced the Continentals in Greene&#x27;s third line. James Webster led the first British units out of the woods—the Jägers, the light infantry of the Guards, and the 33rd Foot—in a charge against the Continentals. The British were able to come within a before they were repulsed by the Continental volley of the 1st Maryland and Delaware companies. However, as the 2nd Guards cleared the woods, they forced the 2nd Maryland to run and captured Finley&#x27;s two six-pounders. The 1st Maryland then turned and engaged the 2nd Guards. William Washington&#x27;s dragoons charged through the rear of the 2nd Guards, turned, and charged through the 2nd Guards a second time. A 1st Maryland bayonet charge followed Washington. Cornwallis then ordered McLeod to fire grapeshot into the mass of fighting men. The grape killed Americans and British but cleared the field of both. Cornwallis then advanced toward the gap left by the 2nd Maryland. At 3:30 pm Greene ordered his troops to withdraw under covering fire by the 4th Virginians. Cornwallis initially ordered a pursuit but recalled his men. In the words of Buchanan, &quot;...reduced to slightly over 1400 effectives...Cornwallis, had ruined his army.&quot;

==Aftermath==

The battle lasted 90 minutes. The British engaged half as many as the Americans yet won possession of the battlefield. However, almost a quarter of the British became casualties. The Americans withdrew intact, which accomplished Greene&#x27;s primary objective. The British, by holding ground with their usual tenacity despite fewer troops, were victorious. However, Cornwallis suffered unsustainable casualties and subsequently withdrew to the coast to re-group, leaving the Americans with the strategic advantage. Seeing the Guilford battle as a classic Pyrrhic victory, British Whig Party leader and war critic Charles James Fox echoed Plutarch&#x27;s famous quotation of Pyrrhus by saying, &quot;Another such victory would ruin the British Army!&quot;

In a letter to Lord George Germain, Cornwallis commented: &quot;From our observation, and the best accounts we could procure, we did not doubt but the strength of the enemy exceeded 7,000 men...I cannot ascertain the loss of the enemy, but it must have been considerable; between 200 and 300 dead were left on the field of battle...many of their wounded escaped...Our forage parties have reported to me that houses in a circle six to eight miles around us are full of others...We took few prisoners.&quot;

Cornwallis wrote about the British force, &quot;The conduct and actions of the officers and soldiers that composed this little army will do more justice to their merit than I can by words. Their persevering intrepidity in action, their invincible patience in the hardships and fatigues of a march of above 600 miles, in which they have forded several large rivers and numberless creeks, many of which would be reckoned large rivers in any other country in the world, without tents or covering against the climate, and often without provisions, will sufficiently manifest their ardent zeal for the honour and interests of their Sovereign and their country.&quot;

After the battle, the British occupied a large expanse of woodland that offered no food or sufficient shelter, and the night brought torrential rains. Fifty of the wounded died before sunrise. Had the British followed the retreating rebels, the redcoats might have come across the rebel baggage and supply wagons, which remained where the Americans had camped on the west bank of the Salisbury road prior to the battle. On March 17, two days after the battle, Cornwallis reported his casualties as 3 officers and 88 men of other ranks killed, and 24 officers and 384 men of other ranks wounded, with a further 25 men missing in action. Webster was wounded during the battle and died two weeks later. Tarleton was also wounded, losing two fingers from taking a bullet in his right hand.

Greene reported his casualties as 57 killed, 111 wounded, and 161 missing among the Continental troops, and 22 killed, 74 wounded, and 885 missing for the militia—a total of 79 killed, 185 wounded, and 1,046 missing. Of those reported missing, 75 were wounded men who were captured by the British. When Cornwallis resumed his march, he left these 75 wounded prisoners at Cross Creek, having earlier left 70 of his own most severely wounded men at the Quaker settlement of New Garden near Snow Camp. An analysis of Revolutionary pension records by Lawrence E. Babits and Joshua B. Howard led the authors to conclude that Greene&#x27;s killed and wounded at the Battle were &quot;probably 15-20 percent higher than shown by official returns,&quot; with a likely &quot;90-94 killed and 211-220 wounded.&quot; Apart from the wounded prisoners, most of the other men returned as &#x27;missing&#x27; were North Carolina militiamen who returned to their homes after the battle. 

To avoid another Camden, Greene retreated with his forces intact. With his small army, fewer than 2,000, Cornwallis declined to follow Greene into the backcountry. Retiring to Hillsborough, Cornwallis raised the royal standard, offered protection to Loyalists, and for the moment appeared to be master of Georgia and the Carolinas. In a few weeks, however, he abandoned the heart of the region and marched to the coast at Wilmington, North Carolina, where he could recruit and refit his army. At Wilmington Cornwallis faced a serious problem. Instead of remaining in North Carolina, he wished to march into Virginia, justifying the move on the grounds that until he occupied Virginia he could not firmly hold the more southerly states he had just overrun. General Henry Clinton sharply criticized the decision as unmilitary and as having been made contrary to his instructions. To Cornwallis he wrote in May: &quot;Had you intimated the probability of your intention, I should certainly have endeavoured to stop you, as I did then, as well as now, consider such a move likely to be dangerous to our interests in the Southern Colonies.&quot; For three months, Cornwallis raided every farm or plantation he came across, from which he took hundreds of horses for his dragoons. He converted another 700 infantry to mounted troops. During these raids, he freed thousands of slaves, of whom 12,000 joined his own force.

General Greene boldly pushed toward Camden and Charleston, South Carolina, with a view to drawing Cornwallis to the points where he was the year before, as well as driving back Lord Rawdon, whom Cornwallis had left in that field. In his main object—the recovery of the southern states—Greene succeeded by the close of the year, but not without hard fighting and reverses. Greene said, &quot;We fight, get beat, rise, and fight again.&quot;

==Legacy==

Every year on or about March 15, re-enactors in period uniforms present a tactical demonstration of Revolutionary War fighting techniques on or near the battle site, major portions of which are preserved in the Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, established in 1917. Recent research has shown that the battlefield extended into the area now within the boundaries of the adjacent Greensboro Country Park to the east. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have saved more than an acre of the battlefield at the site of the British attack on the first line and have turned the land over to the National Park Service for inclusion in the national park. In 2016 a Crown Forces Monument was opened at the Guilford Courthouse National Military Park in honor of the officers and men of Cornwallis&#x27;s army.

Three current Army National Guard units (116th IN, 175th IN and 198th SIG) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. There are only thirty Army National Guard and active Regular Army units with lineages that go back to the colonial era.

The town of Gilford, New Hampshire, despite a clerical error in the spelling, is named after the battle. A New Hampshire historical marker there, number 118, commemorates the naming.

<text>Keith Tyson (born Keith Thomas Bower, 23 August 1969) is an English artist. In 2002, he was the winner of the Turner Prize. Tyson works in a wide range of media, including painting, drawing and installation. His artistic philosophy rejects the notion of a fixed self or a singular artistic style.

==Early life==
Bower moved to Dalton-in-Furness when he was four, adopting his stepfather&#x27;s surname Tyson. He showed an interest in and talent for art at an early age, having been inspired by his &quot;very creative and enthusiastic&quot; primary school art teacher. However he left school and took employment as a fitter and turner with VSEL (Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd., now BAE Systems) in Barrow-in-Furness.
In 1989, he began an art foundation course at the Carlisle College of Art, and the following year he moved south to take up a place on experimental Alternative Practice degree at The Faculty of Arts and Architecture, University of Brighton (1990–93).

==Career==
During the 1990s, Tyson&#x27;s practice was dominated by the &quot;Artmachine&quot;, through which Tyson explored his ongoing interest in randomness, causality, and the question of how things come into being. The Artmachine was a method Tyson developed which used a combination of computer programmes, flow charts and books in order to generate chance combinations of words and ideas, which were then realised in practice as artworks in a wide range of media.

The results of the Artmachine became the basis of Tyson&#x27;s earliest exhibited artworks; &quot;The Artmachine Iterations&quot;, as these works became known, established Tyson&#x27;s reputation in the UK and internationally as an original artist and thinker, and by 1999 he had mounted solo exhibitions in London, New York, Paris and Zürich, as well as contributed to group shows throughout Europe, North America and Australia.

From 1999, Tyson&#x27;s interests practice turned from the Artmachine towards an artistic approach which explored the same thematic terrain, but this time directly by his own hand. The first such body of work was entitled &quot;Drawing and Thinking&quot;. Many of these works were installed in the international exhibition in the 2001 Venice Biennale

In 2002, Tyson mounted &quot;Supercollider&quot; at South London Gallery and then the Kunsthalle Zürich in Switzerland. The name of the exhibition, derived from the popular name for the CERN particle accelerator in Geneva, indicated the significance of scientific ways of seeing and thinking about the world to Tyson&#x27;s art at this time.

In December 2002, Tyson was awarded the British visual arts award, the Turner Prize. The other shortlisted artists that year were Fiona Banner, Liam Gillick and Catherine Yass. The Turner Prize was notorious that year not so much for the controversial nature of the work of the shortlisted artists as in previous years, but because of the comments of then Culture Minister Kim Howells. His comments that the Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain consisted of &quot;cold, mechanical, conceptual bullshit&quot; were greeted with both approval and criticism in the media.

In 2005, The following year, Tyson first exhibited his most monumental and ambitious work to date, &quot;Large Field Array&quot;, in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, which then travelled to the De Pont Museum of Contemporary Art in the Netherlands and The Pace Gallery in New York. In 2009 Tyson&#x27;s work was shown at the Hayward Gallery as part of the group exhibition &quot;Walking in My Mind&quot;.

==Artworks==
===&quot;The Artmachine Iterations&quot;===
Only a fraction of the instructions issued from the Artmachine were realised as artworks (the Artmachine generated around 12,000 proposals which are still unmade), but many of the playful and inventive mixed media works that were created include a twenty-four foot painting made from bathroom sealant, and a painting using toothpaste and music CDs.

===&quot;Large Field Array&quot;===
Described by Walter Robinson as &quot;nothing less than a complete Pop cosmology&quot;, &quot;Large Field Array&quot; comprises 300 modular units, most formed from into implied 2-foot cubes; the cubes are arranged into a grid occupying both the floor and walls of a gallery when installed. Each highly crafted cubic sculpture represents a unique yet highly recognizable feature of the world, from popular culture to natural history. Sculptures as diverse as a representation of American Donald Trump’s wedding cake, a chimney with a bird on top of it with a satellite dish, and a chair made of skeletons, were all constructed and arranged. The installation invited the viewer/participant to negotiate his or her own path through a seemingly random assortment of images and ideas, echoing the mental processes which create free associations between disparate phenomena which so fascinate Tyson.

===&quot;The Nature Paintings&quot; (2005–2008)===
A mixture of paints, pigments and chemicals are allowed to interact in specific ways upon an acid primed aluminium panel. The combined processes of gravity, chemical reaction, temperature, hydrophobia and evaporation simultaneously conspire to create surfaces reminiscent of a wide range of natural forms and landscapes. In this respect, the paintings seem to be depict nature, but they are also created by nature as well.

===&quot;Studio Wall Drawings&quot; (1997–present)===
Collectively these works on paper represent Tyson’s sketchbook or journal. Each ‘Wall Drawing’ is made on a sheet of paper measuring 158 cm x 126 cm, the same dimensions as a small wall in Tyson&#x27;s original studio where he used to draw-up notes. Over the years these sheets have recorded his ideas, emotional tone and mood, visits people made to the studio, world events and even economic fluctuations. They are often exhibited in large non-chronological grids to form solid walls of diverse images, and text.

<doc id="197569" wikidata="Q977418" url="?curid=197569" title="Paul's Boutique">
<text>Paul&#x27;s Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, by Capitol Records. Produced by the Beastie Boys and the Dust Brothers, the album&#x27;s composition makes extensive use of samples, drawn from a wide range of genres including funk, soul, rock, and jazz. It was recorded over two years at Matt Dike&#x27;s apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles.

&quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; did not match the sales of the group&#x27;s 1986 debut &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, and was promoted minimally by Capitol. However, despite its initial commercial failure, it became recognized as the group&#x27;s breakthrough achievement, with its innovative lyrical and sonic style earning them a position as critical favorites within the hip hop community. Sometimes described as the &quot;&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; of hip-hop&quot;, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; has placed on several lists of the greatest albums of all time, and is viewed by many critics as a landmark album of golden age hip hop and a seminal work in sample-based production.

== Background ==
Derided as one-hit wonders and estranged from their previous producer, Rick Rubin, and record label, Def Jam, Beastie Boys were in self-imposed exile in Los Angeles during early 1988, after being written off by most music critics. Following the commercial success of &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, the group was focusing on making an album with more creative depth and less commercial material. The group&#x27;s previous album had been enormously popular and received acclaim among both mainstream and hip hop music critics, although its simple, heavy beats and comically juvenile lyrics led to its label as frat hip hop. The group signed with Capitol Records and EMI Records.

== Production ==

&quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; was produced with the Dust Brothers, whose use of sampling helped establish the practice of multi-layered sampling as an art in itself. While the Dust Brothers were set on making a hit record, they agreed with the group on producing a more experimental and sonically different record. In total, 105 songs are sampled, including 24 individual samples on the last track alone. The Dust Brothers produced the backing tracks with the intention of releasing an instrumental album, but were persuaded by Beastie Boys to use them as the basis of their album.

Contrary to popular belief, most of the sampling for &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; was eventually cleared, but at dramatically lower costs compared to today&#x27;s rates. According to &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, most of the samples were authorized &quot;easily and affordably, something that [...] would be &#x27;unthinkable&#x27; in today&#x27;s litigious music industry.&quot; Mario &quot;Mario C&quot; Caldato Jr., the engineer on the album, said, &quot;We realized we had spent a lot of money in the studio. We had spent about a $1/4 million in rights and licensing for samples.&quot; This type of sampling was only possible before &quot;Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot;, the landmark lawsuit against Biz Markie by Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, which changed hip hop artists&#x27; approach to sampling.

Speaking about the album 20 years on, Adam Yauch said:
The Dust Brothers had a bunch of music together, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they&#x27;d planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – &quot;Shake Your Rump,&quot; for example. They&#x27;d put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when we said we wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, but we wanted all of that stuff on there. I think half of the tracks were written when we got there, and the other half we wrote together.

All the tracks were recorded in Matt Dike&#x27;s living room in Los Angeles, with the exception of &quot;Hello Brooklyn&quot; and &quot;A Year and a Day&quot; from the &quot;B-Boy Bouillabaisse&quot; suite; &quot;A Year and a Day&quot; was recorded in Yauch&#x27;s apartment building in Koreatown, Los Angeles; this location was credited in the album liner notes as the Opium Den. The recordings for &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; were later mixed by the Dust Brothers at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles.

The album is named after a store the group made up called Paul&#x27;s Boutique. On the cover of the album, the group hung a sign saying &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; on an existing clothing store called Lee&#x27;s Sportswear at the corner of Rivington and Ludlow streets, in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side.

== Packaging ==

The cover art and gatefold is a photograph of Ludlow Street (as shot from 99 Rivington Street), credited to Nathanial Hörnblowér, but shot by Jeremy Shatan, who was the original bassist for Beastie Boys, when they were known as the Young Aborigines.

== Release ==
On its initial release, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; was commercially unsuccessful because of its experimental and dense sampling and lyricism, in contrast to the group&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;. It was a commercial disappointment, peaking at only #24 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The album received a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America on September 22 of its release year; it went on to sell over 2 million copies by January 1999 and was certified double platinum. The album was re-released in a 20th anniversary package remastered in 24-bit audio and featuring a commentary track on January 27, 2009.

== Critical reception ==
Contemporary reviews of &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; were uniformly positive, with the production singled out for praise. David Handelman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the songs are &quot;buoyed by the deft interplay of the three voices and a poetic tornado of imagery&quot;, featuring &quot;equally far-flung&quot; musical samples on an album that is &quot;littered with bullshit tough-guy bravado, but it&#x27;s clever and hilarious bullshit&quot;. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commended the Dust Brothers&#x27; &quot;deft&quot; production and Beastie Boys&#x27; rhymes, which he called &quot;hilarious, vicious, surreal, snotty.&quot; David Stubbs of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; agreed, praising the Dust Brothers&#x27; production and calling the record &quot;an outrageously funky triumph&quot;. Although he felt the group&#x27;s performance did not match the quality of the production, he nevertheless considered the album a welcome return for the band after a three-year hiatus. In &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, Jon Young noted the group&#x27;s various pop culture references and numerous samples, and overall commended them for releasing another &quot;classic LP&quot;.

Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, Roger Morton gave praise to &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;, finding that in terms of &quot;weight of ideas&quot;, &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; &quot;shrinks to nothing in comparison&quot;. Danny Weizmann in &quot;LA Weekly&quot; commended the group&#x27;s evolution from &quot;juvenile delinquents&quot; on &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot;, to &quot;psychedelic gurus&quot;. He went on to praise the Dust Brothers&#x27; production, the layers of samples, and felt the closing track &quot;B-Boy Bouillabaisse&quot; will &quot;probably change the face of all hip-hop for a long time to come&quot;. He concluded his review stating: &quot;This album will surely put an end to any notion that the Beastie Boys were a one-shot or a producer&#x27;s creation.&quot; In &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Charles Shaar Murray was less positive. He felt that the group failed to evolve from their debut, calling them &quot;still unlistenable and uncivilized&quot;. He overall considered the samples &quot;ill-matched&quot; and the group&#x27;s performance subpar.

Robert Christgau said although it &quot;doesn&#x27;t jump you the way great rap usually does&quot;, &quot;the Beasties and Tone-Lōc&#x27;s Dust Brothers have worked out a sound that sneaks up on you with its stark beats and literal-minded samples, sometimes in a disturbing way.&quot; He commended them for &quot;bearing down on the cleverest rhymes in the biz&quot; and wrote, &quot;the Beasties concentrate on tall tales rather than boasting or dissing. In their irresponsible, exemplary way, they make fun of drug misuse, racism, assault and other real vices fools may accuse them of.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), he said the album&#x27;s &quot;high-speed volubility and riffs from nowhere will amaze and delight you&quot;, calling it &quot;an absolutely unpretentious and unsententious affirmation of cultural diversity, of where [the group] came from and where they went from there.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Since &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; was first released, its critical standing has improved significantly. &quot;NME&quot; critic Paul Moody found the album to &quot;still [be] an electrifying blast of cool&quot; in a 1994 review, viewing it as a &quot;younger incarnation&quot; of &quot;Ill Communication&quot;. Rob Chapman, writing for &quot;Mojo&quot;, asserted that the album &quot;shredded the rulebook&quot; and called it &quot;one of the most inventive rap albums ever made&quot;. In a 2003 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rob Sheffield called it &quot;a celebration of American junk culture that is still blowing minds today—even fourteen years of obsessive listening can&#x27;t exhaust all the musical and lyrical jokes crammed into &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;&quot;. In a 2009 review, Mark Kemp of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album a &quot;hip-hop masterpiece&quot;. Nate Patrin of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it &quot;a landmark in the art of sampling, a reinvention of a group that looked like it was heading for a gimmicky early dead-end, and a harbinger of the pop-culture obsessions and referential touchstones that would come to define the ensuing decades&#x27; postmodern identity&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine summed the initial reaction to &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; and praised the density that the album contains:

In a &quot;Vibe&quot; interview of all three Beastie Boys, Chuck D of Public Enemy was quoted as saying that the &quot;dirty secret&quot; among the black hip-hop community at the time of release was that &quot;&quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; had the best beats.&quot; During the same &quot;Vibe&quot; interview, Mike D was asked about any possible hesitation he or the band might have had regarding their overt sampling of several minutes of well-known Beatles background tracks, including the song &quot;The End&quot; on &quot;The Sounds of Science&quot;. He claimed that the Beatles filed preliminary legal papers, and that his response was, &quot;What&#x27;s cooler than getting sued by the Beatles?&quot;

In the book &quot;For Whom the Cowbell Tolls: 25 Years of Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;, host of KDOC&#x27;s &quot;Request Video&quot; Gia DeSantis discussed the appeal of the album to local markets and the missed opportunity by Capitol Records to take the album over the top. The book was a follow-up to 33 1/3&#x27;s book &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique.&quot;

Noting that &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; was less commercially successful than the group&#x27;s chart-topping debut had been, Consequence.net&#x27;s Marcus Shorter wrote, &quot;&quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; sat at a finish line waiting for the rest of the world to catch up.&quot;

The historian LeRoy McCarthy began to advocate for the intersection of Ludlow and Rivington streets on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the location of the &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; album cover, to be renamed &quot;Beastie Boys Square&quot; after Adam Yauch&#x27;s death in 2012. In 2014, Manhattan Community Board 3 voted against the renaming. A subsequent proposal to rename the intersection passed on July 14, 2022. The square was officially renamed on September 9, 2023, coinciding with celebrations of the 50th anniversary of hip hop.

== Lost tracks ==
In 2013, music journalists Dan LeRoy and Peter Relic revealed that they had uncovered and restored a tape that represented Beastie Boys&#x27; first recording session in Delicious Vinyl&#x27;s colloquially named Delicious Studios. The tape includes demo versions of six tracks, five of which were produced and utilized in some form on &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;. Most notably, the track &quot;The Jerry Lewis&quot; was omitted. Mike D was presented with the restored version of this track in 2013, and when asked if it deserved an official release, he said &quot;Probably not this year.&quot; After widespread publication of the story, &quot;The Jerry Lewis&quot; has become a highly sought-after &quot;lost track&quot; among dedicated fans.

<text>Zhang Zizhong (; August 11, 1891 – May 16, 1940) was a general of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Born in Linqing, Shandong, he was the highest-ranked officer and the only Army group commander of the NRA to die in the war. He was killed-in-action during the Battle of Yichang after refusing to retreat from the front lines. He showed great valor in the field and was regarded as one of the most valiant and respectable Chinese generals by the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Because he was lieutenant general with the effective rank of full general at the time of his death, and was posthumously promoted to full general, he was also one of the highest-ranked Allied officers killed in action in World War II. His mausoleum is situated in Beibei District, Chongqing. There are roads named after him in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan and Taoyuan City.

==Career timeline==
* 1911: Studied law in Tianjin
* 1914: Assigned to the 20th Army Division near Fengtian (present day Shenyang) as platoon leader
* 1935–1936: Chairman of the Government of Chahar Province
* 1937: Mayor of Tianjin
* 1937: General Officer Commanding 38th Division
* 1937–1940: General Officer Commanding LIX Corps
* 1938: General Officer commanding the 27th Army
* 1939: Commander in Chief Right Flank Army 5th War Area
* 1939–1940: Commander in Chief 33rd Army Group
* 1940: Killed in Action at Mount Chang near Yichang, Hubei
* 1940: Posthumous promotion to Full General

==Death==
General Zhang Zizhong, commander of the eight divisions that constituted the Chinese 33rd Army Group, was killed at approximately 4:00 p.m. on May 16, 1940, in fighting at Shilichangshan (‘Ten li mountain’) near Nanguadian in Northern Hubei. The battle was one engagement of the Zaoyang-Yichang campaign that rumbled through late spring of that year. Surrounded by the Japanese, his forces had refused either to retreat or to surrender. In the ensuing hand-to-hand combat, General Zhang had been wounded seven times in all, by grenade, bullet, and finally by bayonet. The victorious Japanese realized Zhang&#x27;s identity only when a major discovered, in the left breast pocket of his blood-soaked yellow uniform, a fine gold pen engraved with his name. The major quickly summoned senior officers; they ordered a stretcher brought and the body was carried away from the battlefield. (This was observed, through half-opened eyes, by Zhang&#x27;s long-time associate, the Chinese major Ma Xiaotang, who lay nearby, bleeding from a bayonet wound, and who later gasped out the story to Chinese as he died.)

<doc id="197574" wikidata="Q193889" url="?curid=197574" title="Ascites">
<text>Ascites (; , meaning &quot;bag&quot; or &quot;sac&quot;) is the abnormal build-up of fluid in the abdomen. Technically, it is more than 25 ml of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, although volumes greater than one liter may occur. Symptoms may include increased abdominal size, increased weight, abdominal discomfort, and shortness of breath. Complications can include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
In the developed world, the most common cause is liver cirrhosis. Other causes include cancer, heart failure, tuberculosis, pancreatitis, and blockage of the hepatic vein. In cirrhosis, the underlying mechanism involves high blood pressure in the portal system and dysfunction of blood vessels. Diagnosis is typically based on an examination together with ultrasound or a CT scan. Testing the fluid can help in determining the underlying cause.
Treatment often involves a low-salt diet, medication such as diuretics, and draining the fluid. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may be placed but is associated with complications. Attempts to treat the underlying cause, such as by a liver transplant, may be considered. Of those with cirrhosis, more than half develop ascites in the ten years following diagnosis. Of those in this group who develop ascites, half will die within three years.

==Etymology==
The Latin ascites, originally from Greek (askites [ασκίτης]), meant &quot;bag-like dropsy,&quot; from askós (ἀσκός), a leather bag or sheepskin (“wineskin”) used for carrying wine, water or oil.

==Signs and symptoms==
Mild ascites is hard to notice, but severe ascites leads to abdominal distension. People with ascites generally will complain of progressive abdominal heaviness and pressure as well as shortness of breath due to mechanical impingement on the diaphragm.

Ascites is detected with physical examination of the abdomen by visible bulging of the flanks in the reclining person (&quot;flank bulging&quot;), &quot;shifting dullness&quot; (difference in percussion note in the flanks that shifts when the person is turned on the side), or in massive ascites, with a &quot;fluid thrill&quot; or &quot;fluid wave&quot; (tapping or pushing on one side will generate a wave-like effect through the fluid that can be felt in the opposite side of the abdomen).

Other signs of ascites may be present due to its underlying cause. For instance, in portal hypertension (perhaps due to cirrhosis or fibrosis of the liver) people may also complain of leg swelling, bruising, gynecomastia, hematemesis, or mental changes due to encephalopathy. Those with ascites due to cancer (peritoneal carcinomatosis) may complain of chronic fatigue or weight loss. Those with ascites due to heart failure may also complain of shortness of breath as well as wheezing and exercise intolerance.

==Causes==
Causes of high serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG or transudate) are:
* Cirrhosis – 81% (alcoholic in 65%, viral in 10%, cryptogenic in 6%)
* Heart failure – 3%
* Hepatic venous occlusion: Budd–Chiari syndrome or veno-occlusive disease
* Constrictive pericarditis
* Kwashiorkor (childhood protein-energy malnutrition)

Causes of low SAAG (&quot;exudate&quot;) are
* Cancer (metastasis and primary peritoneal carcinomatosis) – 10%
* Infection: Tuberculosis – 2% or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
* Pancreatitis – 1%
* Serositis
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Hereditary angioedema

==Diagnosis==
Routine complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic profile, liver enzymes, and coagulation should be performed. Most experts recommend diagnostic paracentesis if the ascites is new or if the person with ascites is being admitted to the hospital. The fluid is then reviewed for its gross appearance, protein level, albumin, and cell counts (red and white). Additional tests will be performed if indicated such as microbiological culture, Gram stain, and cytopathology.

The serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is probably a better discriminant than older measures (transudate versus exudate) for the causes of ascites. A high gradient (&gt; 1.1 g/dL) indicates the ascites is due to portal hypertension. A low gradient (&lt; 1.1 g/dL) indicates ascites of non-portal hypertensive as a cause.

Ultrasound investigation is often done before attempts to remove fluid from the abdomen. This may reveal the size and shape of the abdominal organs, and Doppler studies may show the direction of flow in the portal vein, as well as detecting Budd–Chiari syndrome (thrombosis of the hepatic vein) and portal vein thrombosis. The sonographer also can estimate the amount of ascitic fluid, and difficult-to-drain ascites may be drained under ultrasound guidance. An abdominal CT scan is more accurate than a sonogram to reveal abdominal organ structure and morphology.

===Classification===
Uncomplicated ascites is characterized by receding or nonrecurring ascites post-paracentesis, and is treatable with diet control and diuretic treatment. Refractory ascites is characterized as ascites that recurs or does not recede post-paracentesis, despite diet control and diuretic treatment.

Uncomplicated ascites is more common, responsive to treatment, and exists in three grades:
* Grade 1: mild, only visible on ultrasound and CT
* Grade 2: detectable with flank bulging and shifting dullness
* Grade 3: directly visible, confirmed with the fluid wave test

Refractory ascites is less common, difficult to treat, and exists in two subtypes: i) diuretic intractable ascites makes up the majority of refractory ascites cases, where diuretic treatment is difficult due to diuretic-induced complications such as elevated creatinine and hypokalemia; ii) diuretic resistant ascites does not respond to diuretic treatment.

==Pathophysiology==
Ascitic fluid can accumulate as a transudate or an exudate. Amounts of up to 35 liters are possible.

Roughly, transudates are a result of increased pressure in the hepatic portal vein (&gt;8 mmHg, usually around 20 mmHg (e.g., due to cirrhosis), while exudates are actively secreted fluid due to inflammation or malignancy. As a result, exudates are high in protein and lactate dehydrogenase and have a low pH (&lt;7.30), a low glucose level, and more white blood cells. Transudates have low protein (&lt;30 g/L), low LDH, high pH, normal glucose, and fewer than 1 white cell per 1000 mm3. Clinically, the most useful measure is the difference between ascitic and serum albumin concentrations. A difference of less than 1 g/dl (10 g/L) implies an exudate.

Portal hypertension plays an important role in the production of ascites by raising capillary hydrostatic pressure within the splanchnic bed.

Regardless of the cause, sequestration of fluid within the abdomen leads to additional fluid retention by the kidneys due to stimulatory effect on blood pressure hormones, notably aldosterone. The sympathetic nervous system is also activated, and renin production is increased due to decreased perfusion of the kidney. Extreme disruption of the renal blood flow can lead to hepatorenal syndrome. Other complications of ascites include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), due to decreased antibacterial factors in the ascitic fluid such as complement.

==Treatment==

Ascites is generally treated while an underlying cause is sought, in order to relieve symptoms and to prevent complications and progression. In people with mild ascites, therapy is usually as an outpatient. The goal is weight loss of no more than 1.0 kg/day for people with both ascites and peripheral edema and no more than 0.5 kg/day for people with ascites alone. In those with severe ascites causing a tense abdomen, hospitalization is generally necessary for paracentesis.

=== High serum-ascites albumin gradient (transudative) ascites ===

====Diet====
Salt restriction is the initial treatment, which allows diuresis (production of urine) since the person now has more fluid than salt concentration. Salt restriction is effective in about 15% of these people. Water restriction is needed if serum sodium levels drop below 130 mmol L−1.

====Diuretics====
Because salt restriction is the basic concept in treatment, and aldosterone is one of the hormones that increase salt retention, a medication that counteracts aldosterone should be sought. Spironolactone (or other distal-tubule diuretics, such as triamterene and amiloride) is the drug of choice, because it blocks the aldosterone receptor in the collecting tubule. This choice has been confirmed in a randomized controlled trial. Diuretics for ascites should be taken once a day. Generally, the starting dose is oral spironolactone 100 mg/day (max 400 mg/day).
40% of people will respond to spironolactone. For nonresponders, a loop diuretic may also be added and generally, furosemide is added at a dose of 40 mg/day (max 160 mg/day), or alternatively (bumetanide or torasemide). The ratio of 100:40 reduces risks of potassium imbalance. Serum potassium level and renal function should be monitored closely while the patient is on these medications.

Monitoring diuresis: Diuresis can be monitored by weighing the person daily. The goal is weight loss of no more than 1.0 kg/day for people with both ascites and peripheral edema and no more than 0.5 kg/day for people with ascites alone.
If daily weights cannot be obtained, diuretics can also be guided by the urinary sodium concentration. Dosage is increased until a negative sodium balance occurs. A random urine sodium-to-potassium ratio of &gt; 1 is 90% sensitivity in predicting negative balance (&gt; 78-mmol/day sodium excretion).

Diuretic resistance: Diuretic resistance can be predicted by giving 80 mg intravenous furosemide after 3 days without diuretics and on an 80 mEq sodium/day diet. The urinary sodium excretion over 8 hours &lt; 50 mEq/8 hours predicts resistance.

If the person exhibits a resistance or poor response to diuretic therapy, ultrafiltration or aquapheresis may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention and congestion. The use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits in people with diuretic resistance and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of diuretics.

====Paracentesis====

In those with severe (tense) ascites, therapeutic paracentesis may be needed in addition to medical treatments listed above. As this may deplete serum albumin levels in the blood, albumin is generally administered intravenously in proportion to the amount of ascites removed.

====Surgery====
Ascites that is refractory to medical therapy is considered an indication for liver transplantation. In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritize people for transplantation.

In a minority of people with advanced cirrhosis that have recurrent ascites, shunts may be used. Typical shunts used are the portacaval shunt, the peritoneovenous shunt, and the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). However, none of these has been shown to extend life expectancy, and they are considered to be bridges to liver transplantation. A 2006 meta-analysis concluded that &quot;TIPS was more effective at removing ascites [than] paracentesis[,] without a significant difference in mortality, gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, and acute renal failure. However, TIPS patients develop hepatic encephalopathy significantly more often.&quot;

Another option for people with refractory or malignant ascites is the automated low-flow ascites pump (Alfapump), an implanted machine, which uses a pump to move ascites from the peritoneal cavity to the bladder for urination.

=== Low SAAG (&quot;exudative&quot;) ascites ===
Exudative ascites generally does not respond to manipulation of the salt balance or diuretic therapy. Repeated paracentesis and treatment of the underlying cause is the mainstay of treatment.

==Society and culture==
It has been suggested that ascites was seen as a punishment especially for oath-breakers among the Proto-Indo-Europeans. This proposal builds on the Hittite military oath as well as various Vedic hymns (RV 7.89, AVS 4.16.7). A similar curse dates to the Kassite dynasty (12th century BC).

<doc id="197575" wikidata="Q2744288" url="?curid=197575" title="Midnite Vultures">
<text>Midnite Vultures is the seventh studio album by American musician Beck, released on November 16, 1999, by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck&#x27;s previous albums in its exploration of widely varying styles, it did not achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough album &quot;Odelay&quot;, but was still critically acclaimed and commercially successful. 
== Recording ==
Working titles for the album included &quot;Zatyricon&quot; (the name of a song released in 2000 as a B-side on the &quot;Nicotine &amp; Gravy&quot; single and later included on the &quot;Beck&quot; EP) and &quot;I Can Smell the V.D. in the Club Tonight&quot; (a line from &quot;Milk &amp; Honey&quot;).

== Influences ==
Several songs were directly inspired by other songs: &quot;Get Real Paid&quot; features a spiraling sequencer motif reminiscent of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Home Computer&quot;; a synth breakdown in &quot;Milk &amp; Honey&quot; echoes a similar riff in Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five&#x27;s &quot;The Message&quot;; &quot;Beautiful Way&quot; came about after listening to The Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Countess from Hong Kong&quot;; and &quot;Debra&quot; was inspired by both Prince&#x27;s song &quot;Adore&quot; and the David Bowie song &quot;Win&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; reached number 34 in the US, where it went gold, and also hit number 19 in the UK. As of July 2008, &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; has sold 743,000 copies in the United States.

The first promotional shows for the album came in late 1999, including a headlining performance at the first Coachella festival on October 9 alongside The Chemical Brothers, Rage Against the Machine and Tool.

Beck had also appeared on the Saturday Night Live episode (dated December 4), The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and the VH1! Fashion Show.

During the following year Beck continued to tour, playing in the U.S., Japan, and at large European festivals such as Bizarre Festival, Reading and Leeds Festival and more, playing about 80 shows from January &#x27;00 until September &#x27;00. The &quot;Vultures&quot; tour was also the last tour featuring DJ Swamp as a part of Beck&#x27;s touring band, whom he had been a part of since 1997.

The first 500,000 copies came in a digipak.

A thirty-second segment of &quot;Beautiful Way&quot; has been bundled with Windows ME as a demo song for Windows Media Player 7, under the name &quot;beck.asf&quot;. The song showcased Media Player&#x27;s Internet integration by displaying a clickable image link. 

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; was praised by most critics, and the album holds a score of 83 at Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Jon Pareles of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that on &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;, Beck &quot;plays the insider, riding the executive plane through the good life with every need fulfilled.&quot; Richard Cromelin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that he gives the album &quot;a cinematic richness, depth and detail with an array of mutations and surprises, from banjo hoedown to electronic effects&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; felt that the album, while narrower in scope than &quot;Odelay&quot;, is &quot;more immediate in impact&quot;.

&quot;Q&quot; praised &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; as an often &quot;musically dazzling&quot; album, while noting that &quot;the one criticism that can be still levelled at Beck is that his songs remain strangely soulless, failing to ever really grip the emotions or stir the soul.&quot; In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic states that while the album&#x27;s initial songs are &quot;tight, catchy, and memorable, the production dense&quot;, the &quot;awkward, misguided shift in tone&quot; of &quot;Hollywood Freaks&quot; gives the rest of the album the impression that &quot;for all the ingenuity, it&#x27;s just a hipster joke.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; felt that &quot;his problem isn&#x27;t that he tries to be funny, but that his jokes are as forced as his horn charts&quot;, later giving it a one-star honorable mention rating and remarking that it &quot;does eventually get funky, if anybody cares but me.&quot;

&quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; was nominated in 2001 for Album of the Year at the 43rd Grammy Awards.

In 2006, &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; was named the 50th &quot;Worst Album Ever&quot; by &quot;Q&quot;. Conversely, in 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number 307 in its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

<doc id="197580" wikidata="Q2556589" url="?curid=197580" title="Mutations (Beck album)">
<text>Mutations is the sixth studio album by the American songwriter Beck, released on November 3, 1998, by DGC Records. Though less commercially successful than the preceding &quot;Odelay&quot;, it won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Mutations&quot; was produced by Nigel Godrich, who was known at that point for his work with Radiohead. The album contains a number of Moog keyboards, acoustic guitars, and string arrangements. The production style was very different from that of Beck&#x27;s previous album &quot;Odelay&quot;, which was heavily influenced by hip hop music and contained many samples. The lyrics are also much more somber and serious than those on &quot;Odelay&quot;, apparent in the songs &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault but My Own&quot; and &quot;Dead Melodies&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==
The record&#x27;s front cover, a picture of Beck tangled in plastic wrap, was taken by the music photographer Autumn de Wilde. Art direction was by designer Robert Fisher. The interior artwork features sculptures and drawings by artist Tim Hawkinson.

==Release==
Before beginning the recording sessions, Beck gained permission from the major label he was under contract with, Geffen, to release &quot;Mutations&quot; on the small indie label Bong Load Records. However, when Geffen executives heard the album, they reneged on their agreement and released the record. This led to a lawsuit filed by Beck against Geffen.

Singles were released for the songs &quot;Tropicalia&quot;, &quot;Cold Brains&quot; (Australia and New Zealand only), and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault but My Own&quot; (Japan only). No promotional music videos were made for any of the singles. Beck appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in promotion of &quot;Mutations&quot;, performing &quot;Tropicalia&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault but My Own&quot;.

&quot;Mutations&quot; reached number 13 in the US, going gold, and achieved 24 in the UK and 23 in Australia. As of July 2008, &quot;Mutations&quot; has sold 586,000 copies in the United States. As of 1999 it has sold over one million copies worldwide.

==Reception==

&quot;Mutations&quot; received critical acclaim. It gained four stars from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and a 9.0 from &quot;Pitchfork&quot;. Thomas Ward of AllMusic deemed the record &quot;one of the finest albums of the 1990s&quot;.

<doc id="197586" wikidata="Q2369946" url="?curid=197586" title="One Foot in the Grave (Beck album)">
<text>One Foot in the Grave is the fourth studio album by American alternative rock musician Beck, released in June 1994 on K Records, an independent label. The album cover features a photo of Beck on the right and bassist James Bertram on the left. It was recorded prior to the release of &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;, but was not released until after that album had met critical and commercial success. &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; shows a strong lo-fi and folk influence, and features several songs that are interpolations or covers of songs popularized by artists like Skip James and The Carter Family.

&quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; features production, songwriting, and backing vocal assistance by Calvin Johnson, founder of K Records and Beat Happening. It also features performances by Built to Spill members James Bertram and Scott Plouf, Love as Laughter&#x27;s Sam Jayne, as well as The Presidents of the United States of America frontman Chris Ballew. The album was recorded at Dub Narcotic Studio, which at the time was housed in Johnson&#x27;s basement.

Like &quot;Stereopathetic Soulmanure&quot;, the album never charted; however, &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; strengthened Beck&#x27;s critical reputation, arguably allowing him to break into the mainstream with &quot;Odelay&quot; in 1996. As of July 2008, &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; had sold 168,000 copies in the United States. On April 14, 2009, the album was reissued with 16 bonus tracks, including 12 unreleased tracks, by Beck&#x27;s own Iliad label.

==Song information==
&quot;He&#x27;s a Mighty Good Leader&quot; is a re-write of Delta blues guitarist Skip James&#x27; &quot;Jesus is a Mighty Good Leader&quot;, utilizing the chords, melody and most of the lyrics from the original.

&quot;Fourteen Rivers Fourteen Floods&quot; utilizes a similar melody, lyric and instrumentation to the African American spiritual &quot;You Gotta Move&quot;, which was popularized by Fred McDowell and later recorded by The Rolling Stones on their &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; album.

&quot;Girl Dreams&quot; is an interpolation of the Carter Family composition &quot;Lover&#x27;s Lane&quot;. According to Calvin Johnson, Beck seemed &quot;embarrassed&quot; by the song and had to be convinced to include it on &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;. Beck would record other Carter Family songs during this time period, including &quot;The Storms Are On The Ocean&quot; recorded as &quot;The World May Lose Its Motion&quot; and released on a 1994 Yoyo Recordings compilation.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Beck, except where noted.
===Japanese bonus tracks===
#&lt;li value=17&gt; &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Mind&quot; – 2:56
# &quot;Feather in Your Cap&quot; – 1:12
# &quot;Whiskey Can Can&quot; – 2:15

These bonus tracks are out-takes from the &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; sessions and were issued on the &quot;It&#x27;s All In Your Mind&quot; 7&quot; single in 1995. Both &quot;Feather in Your Cap&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Mind&quot; were later re-recorded as full studio productions with a full band. The former was recorded in 1994 and issued as a B-side of the &quot;Sissyneck&quot; and &quot;Jack-Ass&quot; singles in 1997 while the latter appeared in a re-recorded version on the 2002 album &quot;Sea Change&quot;.

<text>Sea Change is the eighth studio album by American musician Beck, released on September 24, 2002, by Geffen Records. Recorded over a two-month period in Los Angeles with producer Nigel Godrich, the album features themes of heartbreak and desolation, solitude, and loneliness. For the album, much of Beck&#x27;s trademark cryptic and ironic lyrics were replaced by simpler, more sincere lyrics. He also eschewed the heavy sampling of his previous albums for live instrumentation. Beck cited the breakup with his longtime girlfriend as the major influence on the album.

&quot;Sea Change&quot; peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, later being certified gold in 2005 by the RIAA. It was met with favorable responses from critics, who considered Beck&#x27;s transition from eccentric, sonically experimental work to emotional balladry to be successful and convincing. The album later appeared in many publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of the 2000s, and it remains one of Beck&#x27;s best-reviewed recordings.

In 2014, Beck released the album &quot;Morning Phase&quot;, described in a press release as a &quot;companion piece&quot; to &quot;Sea Change&quot;, featuring the same personnel who performed on it with the exception of Godrich.

&quot;Lost Cause&quot; and &quot;Guess I&#x27;m Doing Fine&quot; were released as promotional-only singles.

==Background==
Following Beck&#x27;s tour for his &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; album, Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Three weeks before Beck&#x27;s 30th birthday, he discovered Limon had been having an affair with a member of Los Angeles band Whiskey Biscuit. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks on &quot;Sea Change&quot;. He wrote most of the album&#x27;s 12 songs in one week, but shelved them. &quot;Songs sit in my head for a while,&quot; he told &quot;Time&quot; in 2002. &quot;I have dozens in there, songs from eight years ago that I&#x27;ve written but never recorded. After a while, I just sort of decide to record them.&quot; Beck had also strayed from the songs to keep from talking about his personal life, as well as to focus on music and &quot;not really strew my baggage across the public lobby.&quot; Eventually, however, he found the songs speak to an experience (a relationship breakup) that is common, and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called his frequent producer, Nigel Godrich.

Beck intended to record the album in late 2001, but due to the September 11 attacks, &quot;it took a while for people to line up.&quot; Before working with Godrich, Beck recorded tracks with Dan &quot;The Automator&quot; Nakamura in January 2002 in preparation for the new record, but no songs from those sessions were used for &quot;Sea Change&quot;. Many songs, such as &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, were performed live prior to the album&#x27;s recording. Another new song, &quot;Evil Things&quot;, was also performed and demoed but ultimately not recorded for the album, due to loss of time. Regarding the performances of more personal tracks in the days before &quot;Sea Change&quot;, Beck explained in a 2008 interview that &quot;Those were the kinds of songs I would play in the middle of the show. I&#x27;d try to throw a couple of them in. I just remember the audience kind of disregarding them, or moshing, or throwing things. Just because those were the kinds of persons that came out.&quot;

==Recording and production==
Beck and his group of musicians entered the studio with intentions to make the record an acoustic-based offering, in the vein of those for his emotive 1998 disc &quot;Mutations&quot;. Early in the recording process, Beck told Godrich that he was hoping to record one track per day, similar to the process of &quot;Mutations&quot;. However, each song ended up taking at least two days to record, due to orchestral arrangements. Musical partners in the studio included drummer James Gadson, and guitarist Jason Falkner, as well as longtime musical partners, keyboardist Roger Joseph Manning Jr., bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen, drummer Joey Waronker, guitarist Smokey Hormel, and cellist Suzie Katayama. In addition, Beck&#x27;s father, David Campbell, provided string arrangements. Joey Waronker left mid-way through recording for Hawaii; James Gadson filled in for him the remaining days.

Recording began as soon as the band entered Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles on March 6, 2002. Much of &quot;Sea Change&quot; was recorded live, with extra effects (including bells and strings) added later. In order to capture the immediacy of the material, the artists worked quickly and spontaneously, frequently laying second takes of songs to disc. During production, Beck realized his singing voice had gotten significantly deeper. &quot;Before we recorded,&quot; said Godrich, &quot;We listened to &quot;Mutations&quot;, and his voice sounded like Mickey Mouse. His range has dropped. Now when he opens his mouth, a canyonesque vibration comes out. It&#x27;s quite remarkable. He has amazing tone.&quot;

By the end of production, the group of musicians had to work faster than they intended. &quot;We kind of ran out of time at the end,&quot; said Beck. &quot;Joni Mitchell was coming in to do her record, but she works very civilized and she takes the weekend off, so we were sneaking in on the weekends and trying to finish.&quot; Eventually, recording lasted a little over three weeks and the album was mixed from there on, which was completed May 7. At one session, Hansen began strumming his 1995 single &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Mind&quot; randomly before beginning a new song, and Godrich became ecstatic, remarking &quot;We have to do that.&quot; The strikingly different re-recorded version appears on &quot;Sea Change&quot; as an &quot;evolved song&quot;, according to Hansen.

&quot;Ship in the Bottle&quot; was the only completed track left off the record. &quot;That was the super-pop song of the record,&quot; said Beck in a 2002 interview. &quot;I think it was a little too corny. I mean, it was heartfelt, but since then people have been telling me they really liked it. I think we felt that the album was so long already. I don&#x27;t know what the fate of that will be.&quot; &quot;Ship in the Bottle&quot; was released on the Japanese version of &quot;Sea Change&quot; and later remasters.

==Composition==
&quot;Sea Change&quot; is based around a musical suite of reflective, acoustic-based songs that showcase Beck&#x27;s singer-songwriter side. The term sea change is defined as a broad transformation, which reflects the departure in style from both Beck&#x27;s previous effort &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; and previous, sample-based recordings, as well as Beck&#x27;s desire to give each album an identity. Origins for the album&#x27;s unique, passionate sound had been building up for years, according to Beck in a 2002 interview: &quot;There are threads of what I&#x27;ve done before. If you listen to my earlier B- sides, you&#x27;ll hear this record. I have been wanting to make this record for years,&quot; he explained. &quot;I&#x27;ve been edging towards the idea, and so it just took a while.&quot; Despite initial difficulty upon deciding on the name, the title originates from &quot;Little One&quot;, the eleventh track on the album: &quot;Drown, drown / Sailors run aground / In a sea change nothing is safe&quot;.

The recordings from the &quot;Sea Change&quot; sessions include themes of heartbreak and desolation, solitude and loneliness. Although often compared to &quot;Mutations&quot;, Beck himself regarded the album, in a 2008 interview, as more representative of his 1994 album &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; and &quot;more representative of what I was doing [in the early days].&quot;

The album&#x27;s sound, particularly on the song &quot;Paper Tiger&quot;, was partially inspired by that of Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s album &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot; (1971). Beck would later produce and collaborate with Gainsbourg&#x27;s daughter Charlotte on her 2009 album &quot;IRM&quot;. James Jackson Toth of &quot;Stereogum&quot; also compared the acoustic and relaxed melodies of &quot;Sea Change&quot; to the works of British singer-songwriter Nick Drake and Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;.

==Promotion and release==
Before release, retailers worried about the commercial impact of &quot;Sea Change&quot; due to its sound. Analysts predicted the album would not receive heavy radio support, noting that Beck&#x27;s reputation, critical acclaim and the possibility of multiple Grammy nominations might offset an uncommercial sound. &quot;It&#x27;s a really beautiful album, but it&#x27;s going to appeal to a different audience than he&#x27;s had before,&quot; said Vince Szydlowski, senior director of product for the Virgin Megastore chain, shortly before the release of &quot;Sea Change&quot;. &quot;If you&#x27;re used to the &#x27;two turntables and a microphone&#x27; Beck, then this isn&#x27;t the record for you. I think it&#x27;ll go gold, but it&#x27;ll struggle beyond gold.&quot; The album&#x27;s release date was announced May 31, 2002. In addition, the album&#x27;s initial track listing was also released, featuring songs in a very different order than their final version, as well as including the track &quot;Ship in the Bottle&quot;. The album&#x27;s title was announced in August 2002. In promotion of the record, new tracks from the record were released in chronological order by track listing weekly through Beck&#x27;s website in July and August, 2002.

&quot;Sea Change&quot; was released on September 24, 2002. The album was re-released in a remastered form by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab in June 2009.

Several music videos were released to promote the album, including ones for &quot;Golden Age&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Tears&quot;, &quot;Guess I&#x27;m Doing Fine&quot;, &quot;Little One&quot;, and two versions of &quot;Lost Cause&quot;.

==Artwork==

&quot;Sea Change&quot; was released with four different album covers, each version containing distinct digital artwork by Jeremy Blake on the CD and the booklet. There were also different hidden messages (lyrical snippets) written under each version&#x27;s CD tray.

The original cover art for the album was used as an effigy in the music video for lead single &quot;Lost Cause&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical===

In a five-star review, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic David Fricke wrote that &quot;Sea Change&quot; was &quot;the best album Beck has ever made, and it sounds like he&#x27;s paid dearly for the achievement.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; went on to name it the best album of 2002. In 2012, the album was ranked number 436 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was ranked number 17 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best albums of the 2000s.

===Commercial===
&quot;Sea Change&quot; peaked at No. 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200 chart and was eventually certified gold in March 2005. In the UK charts, it peaked at No. 20. As of July 2008, &quot;Sea Change&quot; had sold 680,000 copies in the United States.

==Tour==
&quot;Sea Change&quot; yielded many tours in support, the first of which began as a low-key, theatre-based acoustic tour in August 2002. Each show gave a playful, energetic atmosphere, with Beck telling jokes in between performances, and a surprise appearance by Jack White of the White Stripes at the August 11 show, which MTV News described as getting &quot;a standing ovation from the sold-out crowd of college kids and beatniks.&quot; A larger tour was planned for October 2002, with the Flaming Lips as opening band, as well as Beck&#x27;s backing band. The tour began in October and ended in November 2002.

During the touring for &quot;Sea Change&quot;, Beck varied the set list and experimented with song structures, changing the arrangements each night as a way to break away from predictability. True to Beck&#x27;s desire for re-interpretation of songs, he dismissed both his longtime touring band and the group he worked with for &quot;Sea Change&quot; shortly before touring began. Between new and old original songs at each concert, Beck performed many improvisational covers, such as &quot;No Expectations&quot; by the Rolling Stones, Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Kangaroo&quot;, the Zombies&#x27; &quot;Beechwood Park&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; by the Velvet Underground. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the live covers &quot;breathtaking&quot;, adding that they were &quot;a perfect fit — songs about commitment and loss, written and sung by the wounded.&quot;

<text>The Madrid Metro (Spanish: &quot;Metro de Madrid&quot;) is a rapid transit system serving the city of Madrid, capital of Spain. The system is the 14th longest rapid transit system in the world, with a total length of 293 km (182 mi). Its growth between 1995 and 2007 put it among the fastest-growing networks in the world at the time. However, the European debt crisis greatly slowed expansion plans, with many projects being postponed and canceled. Unlike normal Spanish road and rail traffic, which drive on the right, Madrid Metro trains use left-hand running on all lines because traffic in Madrid drove on the left until 1924, five years after the system started operating.

Trains are in circulation every day from 6:00 am until 1:30 am, though during the weekends, this schedule was to be extended by one more hour in the morning in 2020. Furthermore, the regional government intended to keep stations opened around the clock during these days from 2023 onwards. It had only stayed open 24 hours during the 2017 World Pride and during the 2021 Madrid snowstorm.

A light rail system feeding the metro opened in 2007 called Metro Ligero (&quot;light metro&quot;). The Cercanías system works in conjunction with the metro, with a majority of its stations providing access to the underground network.

As of January 2024, the Madrid Metro has 1,710 escalators and 559 elevators.

==History==

===1916–1918: conception and financing===
On 19 September 1916, a royal decree approved the 4-line plan for the creation of the metro of Madrid. The engineers who created the plan - Mendoza, González Echarte, and Otamendi - then began the process of raising 8 million pesetas to begin the first phase of the project, the construction of Line 1 from Sol to Cuatro Caminos. Carlos Mendoza made contact with Enrique Ocharán, the director of Banco de Vizcaya, who offered 4 million pesetas on the condition that the public pledged an additional 4 million.

Mengemor published a brochure to persuade people to make donations. The men were able to raise 2.5 million pesetas of the 4 million they needed. King Alfonso XIII intervened and invested 1.45 million pesetas of his own money.

===1919: construction and inauguration===
The first phase of construction was finished in 1919. It was constructed in a narrow section and the stations had platforms. The enlargement of this line and the construction of two others followed shortly after 1919. The Madrid metro was inaugurated on 17 October 1919 by King Alfonso XIII. At the time of inauguration, the metro had just one line, which ran for between Puerta del Sol and Cuatro Caminos, with eight stops.

The king, the royal family, and others took part in the first official metro ride which went from Cuatro Caminos to Ríos Rosas and took 40 seconds. There they stopped for one minute, before traveling to the Chamberí station which took 45 seconds. The trip went all the way to the end point, Sol. The king and his family then rode the metro back to Cuatro Caminos from Sol, this time without stopping. The journey took 7 minutes and 46 seconds.

After the journey, a lunch was served on the Cuatro Caminos platform, and the engineers were congratulated for creating a &quot;miracle.&quot;

Two days later, on 19 October 1919, the Madrid metro was opened to the public. On its first day, 390 trains ran, 56,220 passengers rode the metro, and the company earned 8,433 pesetas from ticket fares.

During November and December 1919, the metro had an average of 43,537 passengers a day and earned an average of 6,530 pesetas a day from ticket sales. Due to their success, the company decided to expand more, and created 12,000 new shares to sell to the public to raise more funds to fund further expansion.

===1920–1921: expansion of Line 1 and construction of Line 2===
The Company then began to gather materials necessary to expand the Line 1 from Sol with the new stations Progreso, Antón Martín and finally Atocha. The latter was then and is now an important train station for mainline rail.

On 31 July 1920 the company submitted it proposal to extend Line 1 from Atocha to Puente de Vallecas. In 1921 the company declared its interest in beginning the line from Sol to Ventas, with the first phase of the project being built from Sol to Goya, along Calle Alcalá.

Work began on 27 March 1921 to expand the Line 1 from Atocha to Vallecas, and to begin construction on a line from Sol to Goya.

On 26 December 1921 the Sol-Atocha section of the Line 1 was inaugurated, adding three new metro stops to the line: Progreso, Antón Martín, and Atocha. The king and queen, Don Alfonso XIII and Doña Victoria, attended the inauguration.

===1922 and onwards===
In 1924, traffic in Madrid switched from driving on the left to driving on the right, but the lines of the Madrid Metro kept operating on the left hand side. In 1936, the network had three lines and a branch line between Ópera and the old Estación del Norte (now Príncipe Pío). All these stations served as air raid shelters during the Spanish Civil War. After the Civil war, the public works to extend the network went on little by little. In 1944, a fourth line was constructed, absorbing the branch of Line 2 between Goya and Diego de León in 1958, a branch that had been intended to be part of Line 4 since its construction but was operated as a branch of Line 2 until construction works had finished.

In the 1960s, a suburban railway was constructed between Plaza de España and Carabanchel, linked to lines 2 (at Noviciado station with a long transfer) and 3. A fifth metro line was constructed as well with narrow sections, but 90 m platforms. Shortly after opening the first section of Line 5, the platforms of Line 1 were enlarged from 60 to 90 m, permanently closing Chamberí station since it was too close to Iglesia (less than 500 m). Chamberí has been closed ever since and was recently reopened as a museum.

In the early 1970s, the network was greatly expanded to cope with the influx of population and urban sprawl from Madrid&#x27;s economic boom. New lines were planned with larger 115 m long platforms. Lines 4 and 5 were enlarged as well. In 1979, bad management led to a crisis. Projects that had already started were finished during the 1980s and all remaining ones were abandoned. After all those projects, of rail track was completed by 1983 and the suburban railway had also disappeared since it had been extended to Alonso Martínez and subsequently converted to the new Line 10.

=== Expansion from the 1990s ===
Work on a major expansion of the metro began in 1995, with of new line and 132 new stations opened by 2011, built in 4 phases. The average construction pace throughout that era (more than of new line per year) was among the fastest in the world at that time and was equalled or surpassed by only very few metros in the global north (one notable example being Seoul Metro) either then or since.

This included the extension of lines 1, 4 and 7 and the construction of a new Line 11 towards the outlying areas of Madrid. Lines 8 and 10 were joined into a longer Line 10 and a new Line 8 was constructed to expand the underground network towards the airport. The enlarged Line 9 was the first to leave the outskirts of Madrid to arrive in Rivas-Vaciamadrid and Arganda del Rey, two satellite towns located in the southeast of Madrid. Control of the network was transferred to a public enterprise, Metro de Madrid S.A.

In the early 2000s, a huge project installed approximately of new metro tunnels. This construction included a direct connection between downtown Madrid (Nuevos Ministerios) and the airport, a further extension of Line 8, and adding service to the outskirts with a 40 km loop called &quot;MetroSur&quot; serving Madrid&#x27;s southern suburbs.

&quot;MetroSur&quot;, one of the largest ever civil engineering projects in Europe, opened on 11 April 2003. It included of tunnel and 28 new stations, with a new interchange station on Line 10, connecting it to the city centre and stations linking to the local train network. Its construction began in June 2000 and the whole loop was completed in less than three years. It connects Getafe, Móstoles, Alcorcón, Fuenlabrada, and Leganés, five towns located in the south of Madrid. As the metro line is part of a project to develop the area, some stations lay in sparsely populated places or were even surrounded by fields at the time of opening.

Most of the efforts of Madrid regional government in 2000s were channeled towards the enlargement of the Metro network. In the 2003–2007 term, President Esperanza Aguirre funded a multibillion-euro project, which added new lines, and joined or extended almost all of the existing metro lines. The project included the addition of of railway and the construction of 80 new stations. It brought stations to many districts that had never previously had Metro service (&quot;Villaverde, Manoteras, Carabanchel Alto, La Elipa, Pinar de Chamartín&quot;) and to the eastern and northern outskirts as well (&quot;Coslada, San Fernando de Henares, Alcobendas, San Sebastián de los Reyes&quot;). For the first time in Madrid, three interurban light rails (&quot;Metro Ligero&quot; or ML) lines were built to the western outskirts (&quot;Pozuelo de Alarcón, Boadilla del Monte&quot;) – mL2 and mL3 – and to the new northern districts of Sanchinarro and Las Tablas – mL1. As a last minute addition, a project on line 8 connected it to the new T4 terminal of Madrid-Barajas Airport.

The Great Recession and subsequent European debt crisis, which affected Spain particularly hard, brought metro expansion to a halt as austerity measures all but dried up available funding.

==Station design and setup==


The age of many Madrid Metro stations is evident by their design: Older stations on the narrow lines are often quite compact, similar to stations of the Paris Metro. They were decorated with tilings in different colour schemes depending on the station similar to the scheme architect Alfred Grenander implemented at Berlin U-Bahn around the same time. In recent years, most of these stations have been refurbished with single-coloured plates matching those in the newest ones, alongside other improvements such as modernized signalling technology and elevators. The stations built between the late 70s and the early 90s are slightly more spacious, with most of them having cream-coloured walls.

On the other hand, the most recent stations are built with space in mind, and have natural-like lighting and ample entryways. The colour scheme varies between stations, using single-colored plates and covering the whole station in light colors. Recently built transfer stations have white walls, but this is not the norm.

Most stations are built with two side platforms, but a handful of them (the busiest transfers) have a central island platform in addition to the side platforms theoretically dedicated to exits. This system was originally used on the Barcelona Metro and is called the Spanish solution. The 12 stations with this setup are:

* Miguel Hernández
* Campamento, Carabanchel
* Avenida de América, Manuel Becerra, Sainz de Baranda, Pacífico, Plaza Elíptica, Oporto, Laguna
* Avenida de América, Pueblo Nuevo

Two stations have cross-platform interchange arrangement with two island platforms, which allows extremely fast transfers between lines. Both of these stations are on Line , with cross-platform interchanges at Príncipe Pío (with ) and Casa de Campo (with ). On both occasions, Line 10 uses the outside tracks, so passengers unboarding there leave through the &quot;right&quot; side of the train instead of the usual left side.

In addition, 10 stations are built with just one island platform instead of the usual side platforms. These stations are:

* Pinar de Chamartín (one island platform and two side platforms)
* Almendrales, Villaverde Alto
* Aluche
* Feria de Madrid, Aeropuerto T4
* Rivas Urbanizaciones, Arganda del Rey
* Joaquín Vilumbrales

Another system is where there is one island platform with one side platform. This system is used in two stations on lines 2 and 4 as termini, and three stations on Lines 7, 9, and 10 where it is required for passengers to change to smaller trains to continue their journeys, normally to towns outside Madrid like Alcobendas or Coslada. This is done so the island platform can be used for passengers to change easily between trains. In the latter three stations, the island platform is equipped with fare gates for tickets to be validated for travel between fare zones. These stations are:

* Cuatro Caminos
* Argüelles
* Estadio Metropolitano
* Puerta de Arganda
* Tres Olivos

==Overhead power supply system==

Since 1999 Metro de Madrid has used a patented system for its installations: a solid rail hung from the ceiling of the tunnels, instead of the usual copper or aluminium wire hung from overhead gantries at regular intervals. This type of overhead line is rigid, making it more robust and less prone to failures. Installations outside tunnels are rare, as they require many more support structures compared to traditional wire based overhead lines, making them more expensive to install. This system of rigid overhead power supply is also used in other metro systems. Similar installations exist in some mainline rail tunnels where space is limited, e.g. Leipzig City Tunnel or the lower level of Berlin Hauptbahnhof,

==Lines==

The Metro conventional network has 242 stations on 12 lines plus one branch line, totalling , of which approximately 96% of stations are underground. The only surface parts are between Empalme and west of Eugenia de Montijo (); between Lago and north of Casa de Campo (); and between south of Puerta de Arganda and Arganda del Rey (), for a total of 8 aboveground stations. Additionally, some of Metro Ligero (light rail) lines across serve the various regions of the metropolitan area which have been deemed not populated enough to justify the extraordinary spending of new Metro lines. Combined, they have 38 stops, of which 4 also connect to the conventional Metro system. Most of the ML track length is on surface, usually running on platforms separated from normal road traffic. However, ML1 line has some underground stretches and stations.

Traditionally, the Madrid metro was restricted to the city proper, but today nearly one third of its track length runs outside the border of the Madrid municipality. Today, the Metro network is divided in six regions:
* MetroMadrid (zone A): the core network inside the Madrid city borders, with over two-thirds of the overall length. Also includes light rail line 1.
* MetroSur (zones B1 and B2): line 12 and the last two stations of line 10, Joaquín Vilumbrales and Puerta del Sur. Runs through the southern cities of Alcorcón, Leganés, Getafe, Fuenlabrada and Móstoles.
* MetroEste (zone B1): a prolongation of line 7 from Estadio Metropolitano to Hospital del Henares through the municipalities of Coslada and San Fernando de Henares.
* MetroNorte (zone B1): opened in 2007, includes the stretch of line 10 from La Granja to Hospital Infanta Sofía. Serves the northern outskirts of Madrid and the towns of Alcobendas and San Sebastián de los Reyes. There is a train interchange inside the line at Tres Olivos station.
* MLO (zones B1 and B2): comprised by light rail lines 2 and 3. Connects the towns of Pozuelo de Alarcón and Boadilla del Monte to line 10 at Colonia Jardín station.
* TFM (zones B1, B2 and B3): a prolongation of line 9 from Puerta de Arganda, the first ever outside the borders of Madrid, services the cities of Rivas-Vacíamadrid and Arganda del Rey.
At most of the borders between the regions, one has to switch trains even when staying in the same line, because the train frequency is higher in the core MetroMadrid than in the outer regions.

Madrid also has an extensive commuter train (&quot;Cercanías&quot;) network operated by Renfe, the national rail line, which is intermodal with the metro network. In fact, 22 Cercanías stations have connections to the Metro network, which is indicated on the official map by the Cercanías logo. Many of the new lines since 1999 have been built to link to or end at Cercanías stations, like the ML2 line, which ends at the Aravaca station providing a fast entry into Madrid though the C-7 or C-10 commuter lines and arriving in only one step to the bus and Metro hub Príncipe Pío ( ).
Notes:
* Line R is a shuttle service (R stands for &quot;ramal&quot; = &quot;branch&quot;).
* Old stations are not accessible to people with disabilities but since 1995 all new stations must be accessible by law. Thus, both new stations and renewed old ones have elevators for people on wheelchairs, huge signs for the visually impaired, etc.
* All narrow loading gauge lines except line 5 had originally 60m platforms. Line 1 was the first to have theirs extended to 90m, while line 3 had to wait until the 2000s: prior to its recent extension to the southern district of Villaverde, it was completely closed for nearly a year and thoroughly renewed, and was the first to receive the all-new Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles Series 3000 trains.
* Configurations: M – engine (Motor), R – passive (Remolque), S – cabless engine (motor Sin cabina). Dots/dashes mean crossable/complete basic unit separation, while their absence implies a walkable aisle throughout the joined units.
* Alstom Citadis 302 tramways have one motor &quot;car&quot;, one suspended, one with bogie but without motors, one suspended, one motor.
* The four ML (Ligero) lines are . All other lines use gauge, the only railway using a specific Italian gauge outside Italy.

==Rolling stock==

Traditionally, the trains operating in the Madrid Metro have been built and supplied by the Spanish company Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF). This was particularly true under Francisco Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, due to the politic of autarky his administration initially pursued. However, despite CAF still working for the Metro, in recent years the Italian AnsaldoBreda has also provided trains for the wide-profile lines.

Every rolling unit in the Madrid Metro has a unique ID that singles it out in the whole network. Those IDs are grouped by the rolling unit model (the &quot;series&quot;) and thus is used to categorize the trains, as they bear no user-visible statement of the model specified by the manufacturer. An ID is made up of:
* A letter indicating the type of rolling unit: M for a car with both engines and driver&#x27;s cabin (Spanish &quot;Motor&quot;), R for an engineless car, with or without drivers cabin (Spanish &quot;Remolque&quot;) and S for a cabinless car with engines (Spanish &quot;motor Sin cabina&quot;).
* A dash separating the two components
* A three or four digit number indicating the unit&#x27;s series and the position within it. Usually, the series is indicated by the thousands and hundreds (i.e. 5281 indicates a series 5000, subseries 200 train).

===Trainsets currently in use===
====Narrow profile====

CAF series 2000: This series has two separate sub-series usually called A and B. The first batch, while reliable and practical, was extremely &quot;box-like&quot; in its looks. They are nicknamed &#x27;Pandas&#x27;, after a car by Seat with the same name and similar boxy design. In contrast, the B sub-series train sets can be told apart by its sleeker, rounder forms, which has granted them the nickname of &quot;bubble&quot; (&quot;&quot;) for their round driver cabin window. Series 2000A are currently the more numerous in the network: 530 cars were built and delivered between 1985 and 1993, having serviced every narrow profile line. They are also among the oldest stock in operation in the Madrid Metro. The most reliable ones are being refurbished and painted with new, lighter colors like the ones used in Series 3000. Series 2000B were delivered in lesser numbers (about 126 cars) between 1997 and 1998, with the inclusion of air conditioning and station announcements through pre-recorded voice messages and LED displays. They are currently used in line 5, with no plans for retirement.

CAF series 3000: The newest of the narrow line trainsets, series 3000 were commissioned for the reopening of line 3 after its complete renewal in the early 2000s. Their constituent subunits can be completely joined through crossable articulations, making it possible to go from the head to the tail without actually exiting the train. This has earned them the nickname of &quot;boa&quot;, a term usually applied in Spain to double-length buses with such joints. They are currently servicing lines 2, R, 3, 4 and 5. Series 3000 trains look rather like a narrowed version of series 8000, while the interior uses mainly yellow and light blue tones.

====Wide profile====

CAF series 5000: Currently servicing line 9 and occasionally line 6, this model has had a long history: the first trainsets were delivered in 1974 for the newly opened, first wide-profile line 7, while the latest subseries, 5500, of which 24 trainsets of 6 cars each were built, entered service in 1993. They were the last to use the old, square &quot;box-like&quot; design from CAF, which was already becoming unpopular for its exaggerate priming of effectiveness versus aesthetics. The first iteration featured a wood lookalike coating for the inner walls and a novel seat distribution in two-seat rows perpendicular to the train walls, making them look not unlike older regional trains. Subseries 5100–5200 returned to the traditional seating along the train walls, but still included another feature from the first iteration, automatic opening of all the gates in the train. The final subseries, 5500, has a distinct, darker color scheme and returns to the usual on-demand opening of train gates with a button on each one. Being the oldest rolling stock in operation in the wide profile lines, many cars were retired or sold to the Buenos Aires Underground for operation on Line B to make up for shortfalls on the line following extensions.


CAF series 6000: This model, of which 29 trainsets were built and delivered in 1998, was the first by CAF to feature a new, sleeker and rounder design. As it was to serve TFM, the stretch of line 9 connecting Madrid to Arganda del Rey (the first extension of the Metro network outside Madrid proper), its interior resembles the regional Cercanías trains more closely than any other Metro trains: compact seats in couples set perpendicularly to the train walls, more places to grasp in case of a sudden brake/acceleration, etc. They were also the first to include luminous panels stating their destination, as the line they service was effectively split in two stretches, and travellers had to switch trains at Puerta de Arganda. Finally, they primed the &quot;boa train&quot; layout, but the walkable aisle only spanned two cars, while a trainset would usually carry 4 or 6. These trains are equipped with automatic train protection (ATP) and automatic train operation (ATO). Series 6000 is currently doing service on line 9b (TFM). In 2013, 73 of the 108 cars ordered were sold to Buenos Aires for operation on Line B of the metro system; the sale totalled €32.6 million for the retirement of Japanese-built units, with a further 13 cars ordered at a later date. These trains have been widely criticised in Argentina, and been called the worst purchase in the history of the Buenos Aires Underground.


Ansaldobreda series 7000 &amp; 9000: The first purchase to a manufacturer other than CAF, and to a non-Spanish dealer, 37 series 7000 trainsets service the extremely busy line 10. They were the first in the network to feature a full &quot;boa&quot; layout, allowing commuters to traverse the whole six cars. They are extremely functional, with ample 1.3m doors and a sleek, unobtrusive design for a total capacity of 1,260 people per trainset (180 seated). This model also features two TV screens in each car, but they are left unused, both regularly or in emergencies. Series 9000 trains are similar to their previous incarnation, but include better accessibility for disabled people and more safety measures, such as visual and auditive warnings for the train gates and more effective emergency brakes, they also brought small aesthetic changes like the removal of the wood effect from the ceiling and the change of the red top stripe of the doors to a blue color. Series 7000 currently service the main part of line 10 from Puerta del Sur to Tres Olivos and occasionally on line 9; while series 9000 comprise the main fleet of line 7 and 12, occasionally on line 10, and on line 9 to cover for the sold 6000s.


CAF series 8000: Originally designed for the MetroSur line 12, 45 trainsets were built and delivered by CAF in 2002. Each one is composed of three cars or four cars joined in the &quot;boa&quot; layout, with the three car version servicing line 12 and the four car version servicing line 8 as-is, while line 9 &amp; line 10 services use two such trainsets to form a MRM-MRM configuration for a maximum of 1,070 passengers (144 seated). The interior distribution is rather like that of series 7000, with a bigger clear area (i.e. without seating) in the first car for people carrying luggage to/from the airport and disabled people in wheelchairs. Like the narrower series 3000 trainsets, its bogies are insonorized and feature a hybrid rubber-pneumatic suspension system. Series 8000 primed the introduction of regenerative braking in the Madrid Metro. The system reverses the normal circuit of the electric motors when braking, thus making the deceleration &quot;return power&quot; to the network. Also, they feature the now-standard informative panels and gate activity warnings in the interior. A second batch was ordered for line 11 to replace the series 3000 operating on the line since the extension of the line to La Fortuna in 2010. The original batch currently services lines 12 and 8, while also providing rush hour support to lines 9 and 10 while the second batch currently services line 11.
CAF series 8400: Derived from the recent series 8000 trains, the 8400 series are the newest train type to enter service on the Madrid Metro on line 6 since 2010 to complement the older series 5000 serving on that line. It currently services line 6.

====Light rail (named &quot;Metro Ligero&quot;)====

Alstom Citadis 302: The vehicles serving the light rail lines are low-floor articulated trams in a five-section &quot;boa&quot; configuration, which allows for a maximum of about 200 passengers per tram (60 seated). They can reach a top speed of 100 km/h (65 mph), but in practice, they are limited to 70 km/h (45 mph) in most track stretches, and even less in urban sprawls. The tram features a bell-like proximity warning that is activated when the train approaches a station or a level crossing with pedestrians, which has given rise to complaints from people living near the tracks because of the noise generated. Safety features also include door activity warnings for passengers and emergency brakes comparatively more effective than in any other train dedicated to Metro service, as the trams, though remaining in their own lanes separated from other traffic, can cross roads and populated areas.

Currently, Metro Ligero has four lines, although one of them is located outside the city of Madrid in its entirety:

* Metro Ligero 1/Line ML-1: Pinar de Chamartín – Las Tablas: 5,4 km and 9 stations, 5 of which are underground.
* Metro Ligero 2/Line ML-2: Colonia Jardín – Estación de Aravaca: 8,7 km and 13 stations, 3 of which are underground. 
* Metro Ligero 3/Line ML-3: Colonia Jardín – Puerta de Boadilla: 13,7 km and 16 stations, 1 of them is underground – and is shared with ML-2.
* Metro Ligero 4/Line ML4: Tranvía de Parla: 8,3 km and 15 stations.

===Historic rolling stock===
Until the early 1990s and the transfer of the Metro system to the Autonomous Community of Madrid, the rate of investment in the network by the central government was extremely low, and thus very old trains were used way beyond their intended lifespans. Particularly loathed was the case of line 5, which was serviced by the nearly 40-year-old series 300 and 1000 from CAF. It was not uncommon that a child would ride to school on the same train his/her parents took decades earlier. Some renewals, along with the purchases of series 2000A and 5000, were started by the socialist regional government of Joaquín Leguina, but in 1995 the People&#x27;s Party took over the government with the promise to widely extend and improve the Metro service. New lines were built and old ones refurbished: line 5 service was disturbed for several years as some stations at a time were closed and refitted, while line 3 was closed for two consecutive summers in order to expand its platforms to 90 m. Then, new rolling stock was also requested: 1998 saw the arrival of the first CAF series 2000B, retiring the infamous series 1000. Initially, the better-preserved series 300 were refitted and painted in the new blue-white colour scheme (from the old red corporate image), but they were also retired with the arrival of more series 2000B and, finally, series 3000.

==Fares==
The Madrid Metro network is split into the six &quot;functional&quot; zones mentioned above. Each one has a &quot;single&quot; ticket (Billete Sencillo), valid for one trip within the zone, and a 10-trip ticket for a comparatively lower price. When crossing zone boundaries, one has to buy a new ticket for the zone being entered. There is also a &quot;combined&quot; ticket, which provides for a single trip between any two points of the network except the Airport stations, which have an additional supplement of €3. All in all, it is possible to go from the airport to any other point of the network for up to €5.00. All tickets are issued on the Tarjeta Transporte Público.

Also, the Consorcio Regional de Transportes (Regional Transportation Consortium) has a division of its own, with geographic zones named A through C2. This body sells monthly and annual passes for unlimited trips within their zone of validity, and also a range of Tourist Passes for 1, 3, 5 or 7 days. All of them are accepted at the Metro stations within their zones, and passengers using a CRT pass do not have to pay the airport supplement.

==Operators==
The metro is operated by its own company, under the Department of Public Works, City Planning, and Transportation of the autonomous community of Madrid. The passage between Puerta de Arganda (Line 9) and Arganda del Rey (Line 9) is operated by &quot;Transportes Ferroviarios de Madrid&quot; (TFM), while the second and third lines of Metro Ligero are operated by &quot;Metro Ligero Oeste&quot; (MLO). All of Madrid&#x27;s rapid transit systems are members of the Consorcio Regional de Transportes, which sells monthly passes for unlimited use of the metro, bus and commuter train networks within the area covered by the pass.

==Exhibitions==
Some underground stations are large enough to hold public events, such as the three-day fitness festival in May 2011, which attracted 2,600 visitors. Ópera station contains a 200-square-metre archaeological museum.

Various metro stations show contemporary art. The exhibition &quot;100 años de Metro&quot; (100 years of Metro) has received more than 27,000 visitors. At Expometro within the Retiro station, multiple exhibitions of modern art have been on display, such as the exhibition by Pablo Sycet, Rafael Arellano, Tono Carbajo, Christian Domec and Julio Juste called &quot;The Dream of Madrid&quot;, 1986, or &quot;The Passengers&quot; by Daniel Garbade (2000). Both platforms of the station exhibit murals by Antonio Mingote. The Goya station shows works by Francisco Goya (1746–1828) on two murals on the platforms of line 2.

==Tribute==

On 17 October 2019, Google celebrated the 100th anniversary of Madrid Metro with a Google Doodle.

== Future ==
=== Accessibility ===
As part of its Accessibility Plan &quot;Metro Madrid&quot; confirmed that they are going to install lifts at several stations throughout the Metro network to allow easier access for people of reduced mobility. Phase 1 of this plan (between 2016 and 2020) envisaged that 17 additional stations would be equipped with lifts, although by 2020 only 11 of those stations were upgraded, plus one more that was not part of the original plan (Sevilla). Phase 2 (2021–2028) is expected to bring step-free access to a further 24 stations, in addition to the 6 that had not received their upgrades in time for Phase 1.

In addition, in line with local policy, all newly-built stations must be fully step-free from the start. As a result, the relatively new lines , and are already fully step-free at all its stations. Line is likewise entirely wheelchair-accessible since the line&#x27;s major upgrade in 2003–2006.

, there are more than 530 lifts on the network.

=== Line extensions and new stations ===

, there are four projects confirmed by the operator that will expand the Madrid Metro network, three of which are under construction.

==== Extension of line 11 ====
The largest project is the extension of line towards the Valdebebas neighbourhood in the northeast of the city. The extension is expected to be completed by 2030 and will open in three stages:
* Stage 1: the southern section (Plaza Elíptica–Conde de Casal) is already under construction; it will extend the line from its present terminus at Plaza Elíptica by five additional stations: Comillas, Madrid Río (both brand-new stations with no interchange), Palos de la Frontera (interchange with line ), Atocha (intechange with Renfe services to destinations throughout Spain, Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Cercanías&quot; services, and Metro line ), and Conde De Casal (interchange with line ). This extension will coincide with the construction of a major bus station at Conde De Casal, giving the line an additional interchange with inter-city bus services. This section is expected to open in 2024.
* Stage 2: the central section (Conde de Casal–Mar de Cristal) will extend the line towards Mar de Cristal station (interchange with lines and ), with intermediate stations at Vinateros (interchange with line ), La Elipa (interchange with line ), Pueblo Nuevo (interchange with lines and ) and Arturo Soria (interchange with line ). &quot;Metro Madrid&quot; also includes the possibility of constructing more intermediate stations along this section, although makes no mention of where exactly those would be located.
* Stage 3: the northern section (Mar de Cristal–Valdebebas Norte) will take the line to its final northern terminus in the new neighbourhood of Valdebebas, with three new stations: Cuidad de la Justicia (adjacent to the existing Valdebebas station on the &quot;Cercanías&quot; network, with which it will form an interchange), Airport Terminal 4 (interchange with line , the &quot;Cercanías&quot;, and flights from Barajas Airport), and Valdebebas Norte (located west of Terminal 4 of the airport).

The southern terminus of the line is also to be extended at some point during this project, by one stop at Cuatro Vientos where it will interchange with line .

The project has earned line its nickname &quot;The Diagonal&quot;, as it will run across the whole city from the southwest to the northeast. &quot;Metro Madrid&quot; claims that this extension will aid in the decentralisation of the city, given that the line will mostly run away from the city centre (except near Atocha). As such, it is expected to relieve the busy lines and (with the former currently handling most out-of-centre traffic, and the latter also running mostly southwest–northeast).
This project replaces an earlier proposal which would have instead extended the line along a semi-circular route towards Avenida de la Ilustración, via Atocha, Ascao, Arturo Soria and Chamartín. This plan was eventually scrapped in 2020, but not before extra empty platforms were built at Chamartín to accommodate a future extension there. At the southern terminus, some proposals envisaged that the line would instead head south to San Nicasio in Leganés, to connect with line , before the current scheme to Cuatro Vientos was adopted.

==== Line 3 to El Casar ====
Line is due to be extended one stop beyond its southern terminus at Villaverde Alto towards El Casar in Getafe. At El Casar, it will form an interchange with line , giving the latter a second direct Metro connection to the centre of Madrid(beside the existing connection at Puerta del Sur with line ). The extension is in the process of being constructed, and is scheduled to become operational towards the end of 2024.

==== Line 5 to Barajas Airport ====
Another short extension project currently under construction is on line . This line will similarly be extended one stop at its north-eastern end, beyond Alameda de Osuna towards Airport Terminals 1-2-3 station, where it will connect with line and provide a second direct link into the city centre for Madrid Barajas Airport. Its planned opening date is some time around 2028.

==== New station on line 9 ====
The TFM section of line will benefit from an additional station built on its existing route, between Puerta de Arganda and Rivas Urbanizaciones stations. It is projected to open in 2029 and will serve the new communities of Los Ahijones and Los Berrocales once those are built.

==== Further proposals ====
Many pending expansion projects were stalled by the economic fallout of the 2008 financial crisis. During the 2010s, improving the existing network was considered a higher priority than extending it, with major projects such as the aforementioned improved accessibility plan being put into place. Nonetheless, as both the number of trips in the Metro and the number of inhabitants of the Comunidad de Madrid have seen steady increases in recent years, there has been a growing political consensus that further extensions are necessary, especially in regards to supporting the single central circular line in a system of mostly radial lines.

In the context of the Madrid Nuevo Norte project, several official proposals envisage the construction of a new short metro line from Chamartín station, with three new stations located in the new development. &quot;Metro Madrid&quot; announced that this could be a standalone line with fully driverless trains, though a map on the official website for the project suggested that the line could operate as a branch line or extension of the current line .

===New trains===
In , &quot;Metro Madrid&quot; announced that they had ordered 80 new trainsets from Spanish manufacturer CAF, with a total cost of about €950 million. 40 of these trains will be of the broad loading gauge type; these are to be used on line and will be fully driverless – a first for the Madrid Metro. The other half of the order consists of narrower trainsets, which will be semi-automatic and will carry a driver; these sets are destined for line . Both series of trains are expected to enter service on their respective lines from early 2027 and will replace some of the oldest units currently in service, most notably the aging 2000 and 5000 series. Meanwhile, the relatively new 8000 series trains presently used on line will be redeployed on other wide-loading-gauge lines, including supporting the extension of line which is due to open around the same time.

===Platform screen doors and automation===
On , &quot;Metro Madrid&quot; announced that they plan to have platform screen doors installed at all stations on line . The works are scheduled to begin in , coinciding with the major track renewal works that had already been planned for the line that year. This project is considered to be the first major step towards the eventual goal of fully driverless operations on the line.

<doc id="197598" wikidata="Q7355354" url="?curid=197598" title="Rockin' the Suburbs">
<text>Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Ben Folds released on September 11, 2001, after Folds disbanded his group Ben Folds Five. &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; was recorded in Adelaide, Australia, where Folds was living at the time. Two singles from the album were released, &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot;, and &quot;Still Fighting It&quot;.

&quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; is Folds&#x27; only single to make &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking there at number 28 in September 2001. The album peaked at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and at number 11 on the Top Internet Albums chart. A remake of the title track featuring William Shatner appeared in the soundtrack for the 2006 film &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, which stars Shatner as an opossum named Ozzie.

==Track notes==
According to Folds, &quot;Not the Same&quot; is based on a true story of a person he knew who, under the influence of LSD, climbed a tree at a party hosted by Darren Jessee (not Robert Sledge, as the song states), stayed in the tree overnight, and when he came down the next morning was a born-again Christian. Folds used Sledge&#x27;s name instead of Jessee&#x27;s in the lyrics because he thought &quot;it sounded better&quot;.

Folds performed &quot;Gone&quot; with Street Corner Symphony on the finale of Season 2 of &quot;The Sing-Off&quot; and performed &quot;Not the Same&quot; with the Dartmouth Aires on the finale of Season 3.

&quot;Still Fighting It&quot; is a bittersweet ode to the pain of adolescence dedicated to his son Louis. He later wrote an accompanying song for his daughter Gracie, which he named after her and included on his 2005 album &quot;Songs for Silverman&quot;. During live performances, he frequently plays the two songs together.

&quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; parodies the nu metal style of Korn and Rage Against the Machine. Folds stated of the song &quot;I am taking the piss out of the whole scene, especially the followers.&quot;

Ben Folds stated that &quot;Hiro&#x27;s Song&quot; was actually one of his favorites from the album, stating &quot;I also did not use a song called &quot;Hiro&quot; about a Japanese guy. That is actually one of my favorite songs of the album. But it didn’t sequence. I like songs about names and characters. Because people are interesting.&quot;

Of &quot;Zak and Sara,&quot; Folds said, &quot;I was thinking of these kids growing up in the Midwest. A 16 year old boy plays guitar and his girlfriend has to sit and watch him play all day. She just buzzes there and listens like she had nothing better to do. Maybe the girl is also writing songs and she has this idea in her of music that will happen in 20 years time. She really has some good ideas. But she is not saying anything, cause she is supposed to listen to her boyfriend. And he is playing music that was written 20 years ago.&quot;

<doc id="197601" wikidata="Q4857380" url="?curid=197601" title="Banzai (TV series)">
<text>Banzai is a British comedy gambling game show which spoofs Japanese game shows and general television style. It was produced by Radar, part of RDF Media. Each segment of the show is a silly or bizarre contest. Members of the viewing audience were encouraged to bet with each other on the outcome of each segment.

==Format==
The show plays off like a betting show. In each segment, a bizarre challenge is presented with a choice of outcomes. Viewers are given a short amount of time to &#x27;place their bets&#x27; before the challenge starts.

Betting contests on the show included grannies playing chicken with motorized wheelchairs, amputee football, egg eating, blindfolded gas pumping, and the length of time it would take an object to hit the ground after being dropped from a roof. The show also sometimes intentionally skirted the bounds of what some would consider appropriate television content; as in contests to guess which person in a lineup has the longest penis, or the biggest breast implants, or how long it takes a madagascar hissing cockroach to microwave.

The voiceovers (especially those by Burt Kwouk) are English deliberately spoken with a heavily exaggerated Asian accent (&quot;prace your bets – no bet, no get&quot;!). Many minor celebrities take part in the stunts, and the occasional more major celebrities like Rutger Hauer. Usually the celebrity would be ridiculed in the segment. Actor Peter Davison, for example, who formerly played The Doctor on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, was asked which other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor (from Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and Sylvester McCoy) he would most like to have sex with.

Virtually every segment features background music, taken from the 1980s United Kingdom charts, with some from the 1970s.

==Characters==
The show&#x27;s MC, Mr Banzai, played by opera singer Masashi Fujimoto, does not speak except for saying and singing the word &quot;Banzai&quot; in different ways. Mr Banzai acts as referee for many of the contests, directing participants to begin by solemnly clapping his hands and emitting a kiai.

Other regular contributors include &quot;Mr Shake-Hands Man&quot; played by Ryozo Kohira who tries to maintain a handshake with people for as long as possible. He was later replaced when he became too well known with &quot;Mr Shake-Hands Man 2&quot; (played by Japanese-American actor Tadao Tomomatsu), who did the same thing, although his role was mainly with celebrities.

There is also &quot;Lady One Question&quot; played by non-professional Shizuka Hata, who poses as a celebrity reporter, asks a single interview question and then stares silently at the interviewee. In both of these segments, viewers are invited to bet on how long it takes the celebrity to put a stop to the ruse. Often appearing between segments is &quot;Mr Cheekie Chappie&quot; (Jit Loi Chong), wiggling his spectacles and grinning. Voiceovers are provided by Burt Kwouk and Eiji Kusuhara.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Banzai&quot; first aired in the United Kingdom on the digital channel E4. It was repeated a few months later on E4&#x27;s parent channel, Channel 4. It has been repeated on 3 other channels in the United Kingdom: Challenge, Dave and 4Music. It was later picked up for broadcast in Canada by Citytv, which broadcast the original, uncut, un-edited episodes.

It was broadcast in the United States on USA Network for a short time only, and in a different format where the segments were cut up and interspersed with a movie. Then in 2003, Fox picked up the series in the United States (and Americanized it by editing content and saying that some of the people were from the United States instead of parts of the United Kingdom), airing its first episode on 13 July.

It also aired in Brazil in 2005 on the cable channel Multishow. It was broadcast with subtitles with no editing whatsoever.

After six episodes, however, pressure from Asian American groups led Fox to drop the show. In early 2004, the show found a new home on Comedy Central. Re-runs moved once again on March 6, 2006, to G4 as part of its late-night prime programming block, &quot;Midnight Spank&quot; (formerly known as &quot;G4 Late Nights&quot; and &quot;Barbed Wire Biscuit&quot;). The recently opened Philippine cable channel Jack TV also runs Banzai in a primetime weekend slot. Philippine channel RPN also runs the series every Thursday night at 7:30pm. It also airs in Australia on Fox8 and Channel V.

In early 2002, it was also broadcast in Italy on MTV Italy on Friday nights with Italian dubbing. It was also broadcast in United States on Fox 5 and Fox 5 HD on Wednesday nights. &quot;Banzai&quot; is sometimes mistaken for a Japanese-produced show, such as on Comcast&#x27;s interactive guide.

==Mr Shake-Hands Man==
Among the people Mr Shake-Hands Man (sometimes known as Shakey-Hands Man or Mr Shakey-Hand Man) has shaken hands with are:
* Kelsey Grammer
* Angelina Jolie
* Bill Murray
* Chris Tarrant
* Donna Air
He also shook the hand of Def Leppard drummer Rick Allen. One of the last handshakes was with Jackie Collins and it did not last very long as she forced his hand off hers with her other hand.

Mr Shake-Hands Man 2 had a slightly different tactic to the original Mr Shake-Hands Man. Mr Shake-Hands Man 2 would pose as a Japanese reporter and often translate dialogue into Japanese to make conversations (and handshakes) last a little longer.

==Controversy==
In August 2001, two years before Fox aired its first episode of &quot;Banzai&quot;, USA Network aired clips of the Channel 4 edition of the show as part of their &quot;Banzai Movie Friday&quot;. Some Asian American groups objected to the clips.

When Fox picked up the show, the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans protested outside a presentation of the show in Hollywood. Group co-founder Guy Aoki told &quot;BBC News&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s just all the backward images of Asian American people. This is like an Asian minstrel show. Can you imagine the black version of &quot;Banzai&quot;?&quot;. When sponsors were alerted to the content of the show, many dropped their sponsorship, and as a result, Fox canceled &quot;Banzai&quot;.

In April 2002, the show caused further controversy. This was when they attempted to record a sketch, during the funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The film crew were reportedly trying to measure the speed of the funeral procession, with a speed gun to allow viewers to bet on the speed. The police however stopped this, before the procession could pass.

===DVD betting game===
RDF, the licence-holder of &quot;Banzai&quot;, has also worked in conjunction with Screenlife, the makers of the popular Scene It? DVD games, to make possible the creation of a DVD board game for the show (Banzai.com). Board Game creators Gary McGrew and Nick Saad can be seen as animated figures in the &quot;How to Play&quot; section of the DVD. The game DVD is packed with many of the best clips from the programme and uses plastic sushi pieces as the main betting and winning device.

Players must use chopsticks to transfer four types of wacky sushi characters (King Fu Carl – the world&#x27;s last starfish assassin, Lois – the Louisiana Squirrel Roll, Chum and Tako&#x27;s Tentacle) into the main community betting bowl. Whoever transfers the most for that round gets to put down a numbered or lettered betting card in conjunction with the &quot;Banzai&quot; clip in the hopes of getting it right and winning all the sushi in the community bowl.

The player with the most sushi wins the game. The &quot;underground&quot; appeal of the show and the game has also contributed to drinking game rules. The show&#x27;s MC, Mr Banzai, also starred in the making of the DVD as the man who jumped out and shouted &quot;DVD!&quot; and did a number of comical things on the DVD.

There was another DVD called Super Banzai Video Show, which was similar but players just played with the DVD player and the remote. Mr Banzai shocks viewers by jumping in front of the copyright warning at the beginning of the disc. Players are then asked to guess which letter is the Super-Banzai DVD button, A, B or C. If viewers select C, they see about 30 seconds of Tony Hart standing staring at them without saying anything. The correct button is B. Banzai – DVD Betting Game was released 16 September 2011

===Soundtrack===
The Banzai soundtrack was released by 4Music 18 June 2001 on CD.

<doc id="197607" wikidata="Q1939617" url="?curid=197607" title="Radio City (album)">
<text>Radio City is the second studio album by the American rock band Big Star. The album was recorded in late 1973 at Memphis&#x27; Ardent Studios and released on February 20, 1974, by Ardent Records. Though not a commercial success at the time, it is now recognized as a milestone album in the history of power pop music. Critically acclaimed upon its release, the record sold poorly, partly due to a lack of promotion and the distribution problems of the band&#x27;s struggling record label. The album included &quot;September Gurls&quot; and &quot;Back of a Car&quot;, which remain among the most famous Big Star songs; both the Searchers and the Bangles have covered &quot;September Gurls&quot;.

&quot;Radio City&quot;″s reputation has grown since its release, with many critics and listeners of the opinion that it is not only the definitive power pop album but one of the finest rock music albums. As writer Richard Meltzer told an interviewer, &quot;Big Star...is the means through which most bands today who are influenced by the Beatles get their dose of the British Invasion.&quot; It was voted number 319 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2003 and 2012, the album was ranked number 405 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and at number 359 in the 2020 edition. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine also ranked the song &quot;September Gurls&quot; as number 178 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. &quot;Sound &amp; Vision&quot; ranked it number 43 on its Top 50 Albums of All Time list.

The original Ardent Records LP featured record-jacket photographs by noted photographer William Eggleston, including &quot;The Red Ceiling&quot; on the cover. Eggleston was a close friend of band member Alex Chilton. Some of the outtakes from the album include &quot;I Got Kinda Lost&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Light&quot;, &quot;Motel Blues&quot;, and &quot;There Was a Life&quot; (an early version of &quot;There Was a Light&quot; from Chris Bell&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Cosmos&quot; CD). The singles released from the album were &quot;O My Soul&quot; and &quot;September Gurls&quot;.

==Composition and recording==
In late 1972, following the release of the debut album, &quot;#1 Record&quot;, founding member Chris Bell left the group and the band became inactive for four months. Bell had already contributed to the music and lyrics of &quot;O My Soul&quot; and &quot;Back of a Car&quot;—songs which Alex Chilton recalls were written &quot;by committee&quot;— but receives no official credit. Chilton, aided by drummer Richard Rosebrough and at times by bassist Danny Jones, completed the recording of &quot;Mod Lang&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Mover&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s Going Ahn&quot; without Jody Stephens or Andy Hummel. After performing at the Rock Writers Convention in 1973, the band returned to the studio to start work on &quot;Radio City&quot;.

==Reception==
On its release in February 1974, &quot;Radio City&quot; met with general acclaim. &quot;Record World&quot; judged the musicianship &quot;superb&quot;; &quot;Billboard&quot; described the album as &quot;a highly commercial set&quot;, and &quot;Cashbox&quot; called it &quot;a collection of excellent material&quot;. However, sales were thwarted by an inability to make the album available in stores. Stax Records, primary distributor for the band&#x27;s Ardent Records label, had recently placed distribution of its catalog in the hands of the much larger Columbia Records; &quot;Radio City&#x27;s&quot; release coincided with a disagreement between Stax and Columbia, which left Columbia refusing to distribute the catalog. As a result, the album achieved only minimal sales of around 20,000 copies at the time.

Giving an &quot;A&quot; rating, Robert Christgau calls the album &quot;Brilliant, addictive&quot;, observing meanwhile that &quot;The harmonies sound like the lead sheets are upside down and backwards, the guitar solos sound like screwball readymade pastiches, and the lyrics sound like love is strange,&quot; concluding his review with, &quot;Can an album be catchy and twisted at the same time?&quot; &quot;AllMusic&#x27;s&quot; William Ruhlmann considers that the band&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;#1 Record&quot; &quot;lacked something of the pop sweetness (especially the harmonies)&quot; of the debut but captured &quot;Alex Chilton&#x27;s urgency (sometimes desperation) on songs that made his case as a genuine rock &amp; roll eccentric. If &quot;#1 Record&quot; had a certain pop perfection that brought everything together, &quot;Radio City&quot; was the sound of everything falling apart, which proved at least as compelling.&quot;

<text>Monument Records is an American record label co-founded in 1958 by Fred Foster. Originally founded in Washington, D.C., the label moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1960, and experienced success over the next two decades with a number of artists including Roy Orbison, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Ray Stevens, Kris Kristofferson, Charlie McCoy, Boots Randolph, Jeannie Seely and others.

Following financial struggles and bankruptcy, CBS Records acquired the Monument catalog in the 1980s. CBS successor Sony Music reactivated the label in 1997 as a country label, then relaunching the label in 2017.

==History==
After working in record promotions for several years, in March 1958 Fred Foster co-founded Monument Records and publishing company Combine Music with business manager Jack Kirby and well-known Baltimore disc jockey &quot;Buddy&quot; Deane. Founded in Washington, D.C., the label&#x27;s name was inspired by the Washington Monument.

For the label&#x27;s first release, Foster took Billy Grammer to RCA&#x27;s Nashville studio to record &quot;Gotta Travel On&quot; with Chet Atkins. Having spent all but $80 of Monument&#x27;s initial $1,200 of funding, Foster negotiated for Monument to be the first label distributed by London Records. Grammer&#x27;s single, released in October 1958, was a crossover hit, reaching #4 on the U.S. pop chart, #5 on the U.S. country chart, and #14 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart in 1959, selling over 900,000 copies. It also spawned a nationwide dance craze called &quot;The Shag&quot;. Later that year, Monument co-founder &quot;Buddy&quot; Dean sold his 30% share of the company back to Foster before relocating to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where he would buy KOTN in the early &#x27;60s.

In early 1959 Roy Orbison&#x27;s manager and Acuff-Rose president Wesley Rose approached Foster about signing the singer to Monument Records, and Foster said yes. As Orbison began recording for the label, his signature sound was realized, leading to a string of 18 hit singles and five best-selling LPs, beginning with the 1960 release &quot;Only the Lonely.&quot;

The same year, recognizing he was spending more than half of his time in Nashville for recording sessions with Monument artists, Foster relocated Monument Records and Combine Music Hendersonville. By 1961, London Records&#x27; roster of labels the company was distributing had grown to more than forty independents, prompting Foster to move Monument to the independent-distributor network.
In addition to Orbison, Monument became home to a number of other artists including The Velvets, Bob Moore, Boots Randolph, Charlie McCoy, Tony Joe White, Ray Stevens, Kris Kristofferson, Larry Jon Wilson, Larry Gatlin, and Robert Mitchum. Willie Nelson, Tommy Roe, Connie Smith were also signed to Monument for short times. The label was also responsible for developing a number of artists, including Jeannie Seely, Dolly Parton, and Grandpa Jones.

In 1962, Monument Records made history when it released &quot;Too Many Chicks&quot; and &quot;Jealous Heart&quot; by Leona Douglas, the first country &amp; western recording by an African-American woman.

Foster started a soul and R&amp;B label Sound Stage 7 in 1963. Artists on Sound Stage 7 included Joe Simon, Dixie Belles, Arthur Alexander, and Ivory Joe Hunter. Another Monument sublabel was Rising Sons Records.

In 1971, Foster signed a worldwide distribution agreement with CBS Records. The distribution agreement lasted until 1976. Foster switched distribution to PolyGram which lasted until 1982, and then once again CBS handled distribution until 1990.

Foster invested heavily in a banking venture in the 1980s, and sustained disastrous financial losses, which led to Monument filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1983 and the sale of its publishing counterpart, Combine Music, to Entertainment Music Co. in 1985. CBS Records acquired the Monument catalog, and its successor company Sony Music reactivated the label in 1997 as a country label. Some successful artists signed to Monument during this era were Little Big Town and Dixie Chicks. Monument Records catalog is managed by Sony Music&#x27;s Legacy Recordings unit.

== 2017 relaunch ==
In January 2017, Sony Music announced it had revived the Monument label in a joint venture with Sandbox Entertainment CEO and manager Jason Owen and songwriter/producer Shane McAnally. Owen and McAnally serve as co-presidents and have signed artists Caitlyn Smith, Walker Hayes, and Tigirlily Gold.

<doc id="197615" wikidata="Q80389" url="?curid=197615" title="Kuril Islands">
<text>The Kuril Islands or Kurile Islands are a volcanic archipelago administered as part of Sakhalin Oblast in the Russian Far East. The islands stretch approximately northeast from Hokkaido in Japan to Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, separating the Sea of Okhotsk from the north Pacific Ocean. There are 56 islands and many minor islets. The Kuril Islands consist of the Greater Kuril Chain and, at the southwest end, the parallel Lesser Kuril Chain. The group termed the &#x27;South Kurils&#x27; consists of those of the Lesser Kuril Chain together with Kunashir and Iturup in the Greater Kuril Chain. The Vries Strait between Iturup and Urup forms the Miyabe Line dividing the North and South Kurils. The Kuril Islands cover an area of around , with a population of roughly 20,000.

The islands have been under Russian administration since their 1945 invasion by the Soviet Union near the end of World War II. Japan claims the four southernmost islands, including two of the three largest (Iturup and Kunashir), as part of its territory, as well as Shikotan and the unpopulated Habomai islets, which has led to the ongoing Kuril Islands dispute. The disputed islands are known in Japan as the country&#x27;s &quot;Northern Territories&quot;.

== Etymology==
The name &quot;Kuril&quot; originates from the autonym that the Indigenous Ainu had used for the islands, &quot;kur&quot;, meaning &#x27;man&#x27;. It may also be related to names for other islands that have traditionally been inhabited by the Ainu people, such as &quot;Kuyi&quot; or &quot;Kuye&quot; for Sakhalin and &quot;Kai&quot; for Hokkaidō. In Japanese, the Kuril Islands are known as the Chishima Islands (Kanji: , ), and also as the Kuriru Islands (Katakana and Kanji: ). Once Russians had discovered the islands in the 18th century, they had formulated a pseudo-etymology derived from the Russian &#x27;to smoke&#x27; due to the perpetual volcanic plumes emitting from the islands&#x27; volcanoes resembling smoke.

== Geography and climate==

The Kuril Islands form part of the ring of tectonic instability encircling the Pacific Ocean referred to as the Ring of Fire. The islands themselves are summits of stratovolcanoes that are a direct result of the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate, which forms the Kuril Trench some east of the islands. The chain has around 100 volcanoes, some 40 of which are active, and many hot springs and fumaroles. There is frequent seismic activity, including a magnitude 8.5 earthquake in 1963 and one of magnitude 8.3 recorded on November 15, 2006, which resulted in tsunami waves up to reaching the California coast. Raikoke Island, near the centre of the archipelago, has an active volcano which erupted again in June 2019, with emissions reaching .

The climate on the islands is generally severe, with long, cold, stormy winters and short and notoriously foggy summers. The average annual precipitation is , a large portion of which falls as snow. The Köppen climate classification of most of the Kurils is subarctic (&quot;Dfc&quot;), although Kunashir is humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;). However, the Kuril Islands&#x27; climate resembles the subpolar oceanic climate of southwest Alaska much more than the hypercontinental climate of Manchuria and interior Siberia, as precipitation is heavy and permafrost completely absent. It is characterized by mild summers with only 1 to 3 months above and cold, snowy, extremely windy winters below , although usually above .

The chain ranges from temperate to sub-Arctic climate types, and the vegetative cover consequently ranges from tundra in the north to dense spruce and larch forests on the larger southern islands. The highest elevations on the islands are Alaid volcano (highest point: ) on Atlasov Island at the northern end of the chain and Tyatya volcano () on Kunashir Island at the southern end.

Landscape types and habitats on the islands include many kinds of beach and rocky shores, cliffs, wide rivers and fast gravelly streams, forests, grasslands, alpine tundra, crater lakes and peat bogs. The soils are generally productive, owing to the periodic influxes of volcanic ash and, in certain places, owing to significant enrichment by seabird guano. However, many of the steep, unconsolidated slopes are susceptible to landslides and newer volcanic activity can entirely denude a landscape. Only the southernmost island has large areas covered by trees, while more northerly islands have no trees, or spotty tree cover.

The northernmost, Atlasov Island (Araido in Japanese), is an almost-perfect volcanic cone rising sheer out of the sea; it has been praised by the Japanese in haiku, wood-block prints, and other forms, in much the same way as the better-known Mount Fuji. Its summit is the highest point in Sakhalin Oblast.

==Nature==
===Marine===
Owing to their location along the Pacific shelf edge and the confluence of Okhotsk Sea gyre and the southward Oyashio Current, the Kuril islands are surrounded by waters that are among the most productive in the North Pacific, supporting a wide range and high abundance of marine life.

Invertebrates: Extensive kelp beds surrounding almost every island provide crucial habitat for sea urchins, various mollusks and countless other invertebrates and their associated predators. Many species of squid provide a principal component of the diet of many of the smaller marine mammals and birds along the chain.

Fish: Further offshore, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, several species of flatfish are of the greatest commercial importance. During the 1980s, migratory Japanese sardine was one of the most abundant fish in the summer.

Pinniped: The main pinnipeds were a significant object of harvest for the indigenous populations of the Kuril islands, both for food and materials such as skin and bone. The long-term fluctuations in the range and distribution of human settlements along the Kuril island presumably tracked the pinniped ranges. In historical times, fur seals were heavily exploited for their fur in the 19th and early 20th centuries and several of the largest reproductive rookeries, as on Raykoke island, were extirpated. In contrast, commercial harvest of the true seals and Steller sea lions has been relatively insignificant on the Kuril islands proper. Since the 1960s there has been essentially no additional harvest and the pinniped populations in the Kuril islands appear to be fairly healthy and in some cases expanding. The notable exception is the now extinct Japanese sea lion, which was known to occasionally haul out on the Kuril islands.

Sea otters: Sea otters were exploited very heavily for their pelts in the 19th century, as shown by 19th- and 20th-century whaling catch and sighting records.

Seabirds: The Kuril islands are home to many millions of seabirds, including northern fulmars, tufted puffins, murres, kittiwakes, guillemots, auklets, petrels, gulls and cormorants. On many of the smaller islands in summer, where terrestrial predators are absent, virtually every possibly hummock, cliff niche or underneath of boulder is occupied by a nesting bird. Several of the islands, including Kunashir and the Lesser Kuril Chain in the South Kurils, and the northern Kurils from Urup to Paramushir, have been recognised as Important Bird Areas (IBAs) by BirdLife International because they support populations of various threatened bird species, including many waterbirds, seabirds and waders.

===Terrestrial===
The composition of terrestrial species on the Kuril islands is dominated by Asian mainland taxa via migration from Hokkaido and Sakhalin Islands and by Kamchatkan taxa from the North. While highly diverse, there is a relatively low level of endemism on a species level.

The WWF divides the Kuril Islands into two ecoregions. The southern Kurils, along with southwestern Sakhalin, comprise the South Sakhalin-Kurile mixed forests ecoregion. The northern islands are part of the Kamchatka-Kurile meadows and sparse forests, a larger ecoregion that extends onto the Kamchatka Peninsula and Commander Islands. The Miyabe Line dividing the differing sets of predominant plants of the Kurils corresponds to the Vries Strait between Iturup and Urup. 

Because of the generally smaller size and isolation of the central islands, few major terrestrial mammals have colonized these, though red and Arctic foxes were introduced for the sake of the fur trade in the 1880s. The bulk of the terrestrial mammal biomass is taken up by rodents, many introduced in historical times. The largest southernmost and northernmost islands are inhabited by brown bear, foxes, and martens. Leopards once inhabited the islands. Some species of deer are found on the more southerly islands. It is claimed that a wild cat, the Kurilian Bobtail, originates from the Kuril Islands. The bobtail is due to the mutation of a dominant gene. The cat has been domesticated and exported to nearby Russia and bred there, becoming a popular domestic cat.

Among terrestrial birds, ravens, peregrine falcons, some wrens and wagtails are common.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

The Ainu people inhabited the Kuril Islands from early times, although few records predate the 17th century. From the Kamakura period to the Muromachi period, there were Ezo (Ainu) people called Hinomoto from the Pacific coast of Hokkaido to the Kuril region, and Mr. Ando, the Ezo Sateshiku and Ezo Kanrei, was in charge of this (&quot;Suwa Daimyojin Ekotoba&quot;). It is said that when turmoil broke out on Ezogashima, he dispatched troops from Tsugaru. Its activities include the Kanto Gomensen, which calls itself the Ando Suigun, and is based in Jusanminato (&quot;Kaisen Shikimoku&quot;), supplying Japanese products to Ezo society and purchasing large quantities of northern products and shipping them nationwide. (&quot;Thirteen Streets&quot;).The Matsumae clan, a feudal lord of Japan, became independent from the Ando clan (the family of Goro Ando). The Japanese administration first took nominal control of the islands during the Edo period (1603-1868) in the form of claims by the Matsumae clan. The &quot;Shōhō Era Map of Japan&quot; (), a map of Japan made by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1644, shows 39 large and small islands northeast of Hokkaido&#x27;s Shiretoko Peninsula and Cape Nosappu. A Dutch expedition under Maarten Gerritsz Vries explored the islands in 1643. Fedot Alekseyevich Popov sailed into the area .
Russian Cossacks landed on Shumshu in 1711.

American whaleships caught right whales off the islands between 1847 and 1892. Three of the ships were wrecked on the islands: two on Urup in 1855 and one on Makanrushi in 1856. In September 1892, north of Kunashir Island, a Russian schooner seized the bark &quot;Cape Horn Pigeon&quot;, of New Bedford and escorted it to Vladivostok, where it was detained for nearly two weeks.

=== Japanese administration ===
At the very end of the 19th century, the Japanese administration started the forced assimilation of the native Ainu people. Also at this time the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group. Many Japanese moved onto former Ainu lands, including the Kuril islands. The Ainu were required to adopt Japanese names, and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing. Although not compulsory, education was conducted in Japanese. Prior to Japanese colonization (in 1868) about 100 Ainu reportedly lived on the Kuril islands.

=== World War II ===

*In 1941 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto ordered the assembly of the Imperial Japanese Navy strike-force for the Hawaii Operation attack on Pearl Harbor in Tankan or Hitokappu Bay, Iturup Island, South Kurils. The territory was chosen for its sparse population, lack of foreigners, and constant fog-coverage. The Admiral ordered the move to Hawaii on the morning of 26 November.
*On 10 July 1943 the first bombardment against the Japanese bases in Shumshu and Paramushir by American forces occurred. From Alexai airfield 8 B-25 Mitchells from the 77th Bombardment Squadron took off, led by Capt James L. Hudelson. This mission principally struck Paramushir.
*Another mission was flown during 11 September 1943 when the Eleventh Air Force dispatched eight B-24 Liberators and 12 B-25s. Facing reinforced Japanese defenses, 74 crew members in three B-24s and seven B-25 failed to return. 22 men were killed in action, one taken prisoner and 51 interned in Kamchatka.
*The Eleventh Air Force implemented other bombing missions against the northern Kurils, including a strike by six B-24s from the 404th Bombardment Squadron and 16 P-38s from the 54th Fighter Squadron on 5 February 1944.
*Japanese sources report that the Matsuwa military installations were subject to American air-strikes between 1943 and 1944.
*The Americans&#x27; strategic feint called &quot;Operation Wedlock&quot; diverted Japanese attention north and misled them about the U.S. strategy in the Pacific. The plan included air strikes by the USAAF and U.S. Navy bombers which included U.S. Navy shore bombardment and submarine operations. The Japanese increased their garrison in the north Kurils from 8,000 in 1943 to 41,000 in 1944 and maintained more than 400 aircraft in the Kurils and Hokkaidō area in anticipation that the Americans might invade from Alaska.

*American planners had briefly contemplated an invasion of northern Japan from the Aleutian Islands during the autumn of 1943 but rejected that idea as too risky and impractical. They considered the use of Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, on Amchitka and Shemya bases, but rejected the idea. The U.S. military maintained interest in these plans when they ordered the expansion of bases in the western Aleutians, and major construction began on Shemya. In 1945, plans for a possible invasion of Japan via the northern route were shelved.
*Between 18 August and 31 August 1945 Soviet forces invaded the North and South Kurils.
*The Soviets expelled the entire Japanese civilian population of roughly 17,000 by 1946.
*Between 24 August and 4 September 1945 the Eleventh Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces sent two B-24s on reconnaissance missions over the North Kuril Islands with the intention of taking photos of the Soviet occupation in the area. Soviet fighters intercepted and forced them away.

In February 1945 the Yalta Agreement promised to the Soviet Union South Sakhalin and the Kuril islands in return for entering the Pacific War against the Japanese during World War II. In August 1945 the Soviet Union mounted an armed invasion of South Sakhalin at the cost of over 5,000 Soviet and Japanese lives.

===Russian administration===
The Kuril Islands are split into three administrative districts (raions), each a part of Sakhalin Oblast:
*Severo-Kurilsky District (Severo-Kurilsk)
*Kurilsky District (Kurilsk)
*Yuzhno-Kurilsky District (Yuzhno-Kurilsk)

Japan maintains a claim to the three islands of Kunashir, Iturup, and Shikotan, and the Habomai rocks, together called the &quot;Northern Territories&quot;.
In addition, the Japanese government claims that the Kuril Islands, other than the Northern Territories and South Karafuto, are undetermined areas under international law because the San Francisco Peace Treaty does not specify where they belong and the Soviet Union has not signed it.

On 8 February 2017 the Russian government gave names to five previously unnamed Kuril islands in Sakhalin Oblast: Derevyanko Island (after Kuzma Derevyanko, ), Gnechko Island (after Alexey Gnechko, ), Gromyko Island (after Andrei Gromyko, ), Farkhutdinov Island (after Igor Farkhutdinov, ) and Shchetinina Island (after Anna Shchetinina, ).

== Demographics ==

, 19,400 people inhabited the Kuril Islands, of which 16,700 lived on the four disputed southern islands and 2,600 lived on Paramushir, the northernmost large island; the islands in between are uninhabited. These include ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Tatars, Nivkhs, Oroch, Japanese and Ainus. Iturup Island is over 60% ethnically Ukrainian. Russian Orthodox Christianity is the main religion. Some of the villages are permanently occupied by Russian soldiers. Others are inhabited by civilians, who are mostly fishers, workers in fish factories, dockers, and social sphere workers (police, medics, teachers, etc.). Construction works on the islands have attracted migrant workers from the rest of Russia and other post-Soviet states. , there were only 8 inhabited islands out of a total of 56.

==Economy==
Fishing is the primary occupation. The islands have strategic and economic value, in terms of fisheries and also mineral deposits of pyrite, sulfur, and various polymetallic ores. There are hopes that oil exploration will provide an economic boost to the islands.

In 2014, construction workers built a pier and a breakwater in Kitovy Bay, central Iturup, where barges are a major means of transport, sailing between the cove and ships anchored offshore. A new road has been carved through the woods near Kurilsk, the island&#x27;s biggest village, going to the site of Yuzhno-Kurilsk Mendeleyevo Airport.

Gidrostroy, the Kurils&#x27; biggest business group with interests in fishing, construction and real estate, built its second fish processing factory on Iturup island in 2006, introducing a state-of-the-art conveyor system.

To deal with a rise in the demand of electricity, the local government is also upgrading a state-run geothermal power plant at Mount Baransky, an active volcano, where steam and hot water can be found.

In 2022, a special economic zone was established on the Kuril islands with special tax regimes, exemption from corporate income tax, VAT with reduced customs duties for 20 years. It is an important part of Russian government&#x27;s plan to develop the Russian far east.

== Military ==
The main Russian force stationed on the islands is the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division, which has its headquarters in Goryachiye Klyuchi on the Iturup Island. There are also Border Guard Service troops stationed on the islands. In February 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called for substantial reinforcements of the Kuril Islands defences. Subsequently, in 2015, additional anti-aircraft missile systems Tor and Buk, coastal defence missile system Bastion, Kamov Ka-52 combat helicopters and one &quot;Varshavyanka&quot; project submarine came on defence of Kuril Islands. During the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, it was reported that parts of the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division were redeployed to Eastern Ukraine.

== List of main islands ==

While in Russian sources the islands are mentioned for the first time in 1646, the earliest detailed information about them was provided by the explorer Vladimir Atlasov in 1697. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the Kuril Islands were explored by: Danila Antsiferov, I. Kozyrevsky, Ivan Yevreinov, Fyodor Luzhin, Martin Spanberg, Adam Johann von Krusenstern, Vasily Golovnin, and Henry James Snow.

<text>José María Alfredo Aznar López (; born 25 February 1953) is a Spanish politician who was the prime minister of Spain from 1996 to 2004. He led the People&#x27;s Party (PP), the dominant centre-right political party in Spain.

A member of the Frente de Estudiantes Sindicalistas, a dissident Falangist student organisation, in his youth, he studied law at the Complutense University of Madrid and first worked in the public sector as an Inspector of the Finances of the State (). He joined the People&#x27;s Alliance, which was re-founded as the People&#x27;s Party in 1989. He led the Junta of Castile and León from 1987 to 1989 and was Leader of the Opposition at the national level from 1989 to 1996. In 1995, he survived an assassination attempt from the Basque separatist group ETA.

The People&#x27;s Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (EAJ-PNV), Catalan (CiU) and Canarian (CC) regionalists. He was finally invested prime minister on 4 May 1996, and his first term was marked by market liberalization, deregulation of the economy, cutting of state expenses and privatization of several state-owned companies. During his first term, the economy grew and Spain met the criteria to participate in the creation of the eurozone, but unemployment remained moderately high. Some relevant events in Aznar&#x27;s first term were the assassination of PP politician Miguel Ángel Blanco by ETA. Aznar attempted to negotiate with ETA between 1998 and 1999, but the parties did not reach an agreement and violence continued.

Aznar also got the most votes in the 2000 general election this time obtaining an absolute majority of 183 deputies (out of 350) in the Congress. The economy kept growing and unemployment finally began to fall during his second term. In foreign policy, Spain adopted a neoconservative approach and grew closer ties with the United States and the Bush administration, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Aznar supported the American-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2002, he faced harsh criticisms for the government&#x27;s response to the Prestige oil spill in Galicia. Support of the PP further declined after the invasion of Iraq, which was not supported by the majority of the Spanish population, but was nevertheless carried out with Spanish support for the U.S. and the UK. A 2003 poll conducted by the public research institute CIS found that 91% of Spaniards were against the invasion of Iraq.

In 2004, a general election in Spain was scheduled for 14 March, which was not contested by Aznar, but by his successor as lead of the PP, Mariano Rajoy. On 11 March, the 2004 Madrid train bombings occurred, which killed 192 people. The government claimed the bombings were perpetrated by ETA. In the few days between the bombings and the election, the PP defended this position: however, a major sector of the population rejected the hypothesis that the attacks were perpetrated by ETA and believed the government was lying because of the bombings&#x27; possible connection to Spanish support for the invasion of Iraq. This led to a massive drop in support for the PP in the days before the election, and the opposing PSOE&#x27;s José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero won the election.

Aznar remains active in the private sector, and he sometimes gives his views on current issues. He was a member of the Council of State from 2005 to 2006. He is the president of Spanish think tank FAES and is a director of News Corporation. He held the honorary (symbolic) presidency of the PP until 2016, when he renounced the title. On February 14, 2024, Aznar resigned from his position as a lobbyist for Philip Morris.

==Early life==
Aznar was born in Madrid in 1953, the son of Manuel Aznar Acedo, an army official, journalist and radio broadcaster, and the grandson of Manuel Aznar Zubigaray, a former Basque nationalist broadcaster who later became a Falangist propagandist and a prominent journalist during the Franco era. Both his father and grandfather held governmental positions during the dictatorship.

He was educated at the Colegio del Pilar in Madrid. As a sixteen-year-old, Aznar espoused an independent brand of Falangism as a member of the Frente de Estudiantes Sindicalistas (FES), a Falangist dissident student organization opposed to the Francoist regime. Primordially a university organization, a teenage Aznar became responsible for the high-school branch set up in the late 1960s, and was tasked with promoting Falangism amongst Spain’s school-going youth along the organisation’s lines.

Aznar graduated in law at the Complutense University of Madrid in 1975 and became a Tax Authority inspector in 1976.

==Politician in People&#x27;s Alliance ==
After the death of Francisco Franco and the restoration of democracy, Aznar joined the &quot;Alianza Popular&quot; (AP) in January 1979, a few months after his wife. In March he became the Secretary General of the party in La Rioja, occupying the post until 1980. In February 1981 he joined the AP&#x27;s National executive committee. He became Assistant Secretary General in February 1982.

On 26 October 1982 he was elected to parliament, representing Ávila. On 22 June 1985 he was appointed to the presidency of the AP in Castile and León. On 2 December 1986 AP leader Manuel Fraga resigned following fierce internal party fighting in the aftermath of another failure to dislodge the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). Aznar was not considered senior enough to be a possible successor, and gave his support to Miguel Herrero de Miñón, who lost the leadership bid to Fraga&#x27;s choice, Antonio Hernández Mancha. As a result, Aznar lost his post as Assistant Secretary General.

On 10 June 1987, after having resigned to his seat in the Congress of Deputies, he was elected member of the Cortes of Castile and León in the 1987 Castilian-Leonese regional election, representing Ávila. Soon after, he was invested as president of the region, forming an uneasy coalition government with the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS).

== Leader of the Opposition ==

In 1989 Aznar was voted by the National Executive Committee of AP to be the new leader of the party, re-founded as the &quot;Partido Popular&quot; (People&#x27;s Party, or PP). With Fraga focused on the presidency of Galicia, Aznar was confirmed as leader of the PP at their 10th National Congress at the end of March 1990. In November the PP moved from the Conservative group in the European Parliament to the more centrist Christian Democratic European People&#x27;s Party.

On 6 June 1993 the PP again lost the general election, but improved on their previous performance by obtaining 34.8% of the vote. The PSOE lost its absolute majority and needed to form a coalition government with other parties in order to continue governing. The result was a disappointment for the PP as the opinion polls had predicted a victory for them. They did well in the 1994 European and 1995 local elections.

On 19 April 1995, Aznar&#x27;s armored car prevented him from being assassinated by an ETA bomb.

The PP won the 3 March 1996 general election with 37.6% of the vote, thus ending 13 years of PSOE rule. With 156 of the 350 seats (the PSOE won 141) Aznar had to reach agreements with two regional nationalist parties, Convergence and Unity (Catalan) and the Canary Islands Coalition, in order to govern with additional support from the Basque Nationalist Party. He was voted in as prime minister with 181 votes in the Cortes Generales on 4 May and sworn in the next day by King Juan Carlos I.

==Premiership==
===First term (1996–2000)===

Aznar&#x27;s government has been described as the first conservative government since 1983, or since the death of Francisco Franco.

The Aznar Government maintained the commitment of the previous government to join the European Union&#x27;s single currency and showed itself willing to take political risks in order to meet the requirements for membership. Aznar also announced the sale early in 1997 of the nation&#x27;s remaining minority stake (golden shares) in the Telefónica telecommunications company and the petroleum group Repsol. This marked the beginning of a period of privatizations after the previous PSOE government had nationalized parts of the economy.

===Second term (2000–2004)===
Spanish voters reelected Aznar in the 2000 general election with an outright majority. The PP obtained 44.5% of the vote and 183 seats. The Spanish electorate&#x27;s participation was the lowest for a general election in Spain in the post-Franco era.

After six years of relative political calm, when political debate was dominated by a consensus within the ruling party on economics, regional nationalism, and terrorism, several issues arose which polarized Spanish public opinion. Like UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, Aznar actively supported the United States&#x27; War on Terrorism, despite public opposition. Aznar met with Bush in a private meeting before the 2003 invasion of Iraq to discuss the situation in the UN Security Council. &quot;El País&quot; leaked a partial transcript of the meeting. The government&#x27;s handling of the wreckage of the Greek Prestige tanker near the Spanish coast, which resulted in a major ecological disaster, also became a divisive issue.

He actively encouraged and supported the Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy and the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. He defended it on the basis of secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence of the Iraqi government&#x27;s nuclear proliferation. On 30 January 2003, Aznar signed &quot;The letter of the eight&quot; supporting US. policy on Iraq. The majority of the Spanish population, including some PP members, were against the war. Spain&#x27;s major cities were the scene of the largest street demonstrations ever seen in the country as a result of the government&#x27;s participation in the invasion. Aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the PP in 2000. On a live TV interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place in the streets, he asked the Spanish people to take his word assuring there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, of which he had evidence. This is now regarded as incorrect.

On the economic front, the government pursued the privatization of public enterprises and focused its attention on debt reduction. Investment in research was drastically reduced, and large cuts were also made in social spending. Social housing construction fell by over 30%, and households went into debt in response to the sharp rise in the price of building land.

In January 2004 Aznar called a general election and designated his successor as candidate, Mariano Rajoy, sticking to a pledge of not seeking office for a third term. Despite political tensions, polls suggested that the People&#x27;s Party was set to win a third consecutive election on the strength of the economy.
An opinion poll carried out by the government-run CIS (which had estimated that 92% of the Spanish people did not support the War in Iraq) in February 2004 estimated that the PP would win an election with 42.2% of the vote while the PSOE would only get 35.5%.

===Madrid train bombings and end of term===

Three days before the 2004 general election, 10 bombs killed 191 people in the 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings. Initially, the government and the opposition stated publicly that it was possible the bombings may have been the work of ETA. However, the PP government continued to blame ETA even after evidence that the attacks may have been the work of an Islamist group emerged, having the minister of foreign affairs, Ana Palacio, instruct all Spanish diplomats to place the blame on ETA at every opportunity. The public perception that the government hid information from the general population gave rise to a public outcry. Two days after the Atocha bombings, demonstrations took place across Spain demanding news from the investigation, where chants such as &quot;We want the truth before we vote&quot; and &quot;Who is responsible?&quot; were heard.
Three days after the train bombings, the opposition PSOE won the elections. The subsequent investigations held by a Parliamentary Committee were characterized by bitter partisan exchanges between the different political parties, with dispute over who may have been responsible for the bombings. Aznar appeared before the Committee in November 2004 and declared his belief that the authors of the bombings were not to be found &quot;in faraway deserts or remote mountains.&quot; Aznar said in 2006 that he thought that the attacks were not exclusively perpetrated by Islamists.

==After 2004==

After leaving office on 17 April 2004 he presided over the FAES think tank, which is associated with the PP. After a 2005 reform, promoted by Prime Minister Rodríguez Zapatero, former prime ministers were admitted into the Council of State, a position from which he later resigned.

Aznar was appointed Distinguished Scholar in the Practice of Global Leadership at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. in April 2004. In this position, he teaches two seminars per semester on contemporary European politics and trans-Atlantic relationships in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. Additionally, he teaches a course on political leadership, convened by Professor Carol Lancaster, with former Polish President Kwasniewski. Aznar leads public dialogues on pressing contemporary concerns in collaboration with other members of the faculty; he was awarded an honorary degree at Universidad Francisco Marroquin.

In 2007, Aznar was appointed to the advisory board of Centaurus Capital, a London-based hedge fund, an appointment which proved to be short-lived. In 2006, he was appointed to the Board of Directors of News Corporation, the media conglomerate of Rupert Murdoch. He is also member of the European Advisory Panel of The European Business Awards and the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation.

Aznar is a member of the Club de Madrid, an independent non-profit organization created to promote democracy and change in the international community, composed by more than 100 members: former democratic Heads of State and Government from around the world.

Aznar was also one of the signatories and promoters of the Prague Charter.

Aznar was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from CEU Cardinal Herrera University.

Since 2013, Aznar has served on the Leadership Council for Concordia, a nonpartisan, nonprofit based in New York City focused on promoting effective public-private collaboration to create a more prosperous and sustainable future, and is a member of the Board of Directors of Afiniti, a US based artificial intelligence business.

He received the &quot;America Award&quot; of the Italy-USA Foundation in 2019.

In 2022, his cumulative salary since he began advising Rupert Murdoch in 2006 exceeded $4 million.

==Political positions==

===Environmental issues===
In October 2008, on the occasion of a visit by the Czech President Václav Klaus to the Spanish capital, Aznar said that anthropogenic climate change is a &quot;scientifically questionable&quot; theory which had become a religion, and whose followers were &quot;enemies of freedom&quot;.
These views were similar to those expressed by Klaus in his book &quot;Blue Planet in Green Shackles&quot;, which was published in Spanish by FAES. Aznar&#x27;s speech caused some puzzlement, as his government had been a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, and it appeared that he had subsequently changed his mind about climate change.
In 2009 Aznar was due to speak to a Heartland Institute conference, which was billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest-ever gathering of global warming skeptics&quot;. He withdrew at short notice, and in the absence of a public explanation there was speculation that he did so in order to spare his party embarrassment. The People&#x27;s Party distanced itself from the environmental views of Aznar, classing him among a &quot;sceptical minority&quot; within its membership. However, some People&#x27;s Party politicians favored Aznar and wanted a public debate on climate change, most notably Esperanza Aguirre.

In 2010 it was reported that Aznar would chair the Advisory Council of the Global Adaptation Institute, a new body concerned with adaptation to climate change.

===Foreign policy===

====Israel====
In 2010, Aznar founded the Friends of Israel Initiative, with the stated goal to &quot;counter the attempts to delegitimize the State of Israel and its right to live in peace within safe and defensible borders&quot;. Referring to the ill-fated takeover of the Mavi Marmara by Israeli commandos, Aznar said in 2010 that the world must support Israel because &quot;if it goes down, we all go down&quot;. He said that &quot;In an ideal world, the assault by Israeli commandos on the &quot;Mavi Marmara&quot; would not have ended up with nine dead and a score wounded. In an ideal world, the soldiers would have been peacefully welcomed on to the ship.&quot;

He criticized Turkey for placing Israel &quot;in an impossible situation&quot; in which it would have to either give up its security or face world condemnation. Aznar concluded that Israel is the West&#x27;s first line of defense, and must be protected.
In 2014, in an address at the British House of Commons Aznar said Israel is needed by the European Union. He said his report recommends that due to its Western culture and the benefits it brings the European Union, Israel should become a full member of the EU without pre-conditions.

==Controversy==
Aznar&#x27;s government posthumously granted a medal of Civil Merit to Melitón Manzanas, the head of the secret police in San Sebastián and the first high-profile member of the Francoist government killed by ETA in 1968. Manzanas was widely considered a torturer, and Amnesty International condemned the award.

After the 2004 elections it was revealed that Aznar and his government secretly channeled public funds to a United States legal firm to lobby for the bestowment of the Congressional Gold Medal on Aznar. The contract consisted in a first payment of US$700,000 for the first seven months, followed by $100,000 monthly payments until it reached the sum of $2 million.

In an interview with BBC World on 27 July 2006 he voiced doubts about Islamists being the sole culprits of the disputed 2004 Madrid train bombings, &quot;You know in this moment some perpetrators of the attacks, but you do not know who imagined the attack, who is the leader of the attack, who is the idea (sic) of the attack, who established and supported means for the attacks, who defined the logistics of the attacks, who established the strategies of the attack. Nothing...I think that one part of the perpetrators are Islamists, but I think that this is not only an Islamist attack.&quot;

During a Washington, D.C. conference at the Hudson Institute, a conservative U.S. think tank, on 23 September 2006, referring to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s comments on Islam and violence, Aznar asked why Muslims had not apologized for occupying Spain for 800 years as Al-Andalus. He then called the Alliance of Civilizations initiative &quot;stupid.&quot; His reference to apologies was a response to the demonstrations asking the Pope to apologize. One PP official clarified Aznar&#x27;s speech by saying the prime minister thought it is pointless to apologize for historical events.

The American magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; ranks him among the &quot;five worst ex-presidents of the world&quot; for his post-presidency behavior. According to the magazine, Aznar distinguished himself by his &quot;extreme rhetoric&quot; for his negationist positions on the issue of global warming, his rejection of the efforts of inter-religious dialogue or for having declared that the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States would lead to a &quot;foreseeable economic disaster&quot;.

=== Accusations of corruption ===
In 2015, after a series of cases spread over several years, 11 of the 14 members of José María Aznar&#x27;s government from 2002 to 2003 were imprisoned or prosecuted for influence peddling, money laundering and tax fraud. Aznar himself is suspected by the Spanish justice system of having benefited from a party slush fund between 1990 and 1996 for an amount of 782,695 euros.

He was summoned by the courts in March 2021 to explain the &#x27;B fund&#x27; that the PP had allegedly maintained for more than twenty years. This was allegedly used to receive anonymous donations from business leaders in order to pay &quot;salary supplements&quot; to party officials.

==Personal life==

In 1977 Aznar married Ana Botella, by whom he has three children: José María, Ana and Alonso. Their daughter married Alejandro Agag at El Escorial on 5 September 2002, and they have four children.

In 2008 in response to rumours, Aznar denied being the father of Zohra Dati, daughter of Rachida Dati, the then French minister for justice. Dati subsequently claimed that another individual, Dominique Desseigne, was the father of her child.

In December 2012, a French court ordered Desseigne to undergo a paternity test to see if he fathered Dati&#x27;s child. A French court decision of 7 January 2016 ruled that Desseigne was indeed the father.

<text>The Grand Slam in tennis is the achievement of winning all four major championships in one discipline in a calendar year. In doubles, a Grand Slam may be achieved as a team or as an individual with different partners. Winning all four major championships consecutively but not within the same calendar year is referred to as a &quot;non-calendar-year Grand Slam&quot;, while winning the four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a &quot;Career Grand Slam&quot;.

The term Grand Slam is also attributed to the Grand Slam tournaments, referred to as Majors, and they are the world&#x27;s four most important annual professional tennis tournaments. They offer the most ranking points, prize money, public and media attention, the greatest strength and size of the field and, in recent years, the longest matches for men (best of five sets, best of three for the women). The tournaments are overseen by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), rather than the separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tour organizing bodies, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA), but both the ATP and WTA award ranking points based on players&#x27; performances in them.

The four Grand Slam tournaments are the Australian Open in January, the French Open from late May to early June, Wimbledon in late June to early July, and the US Open in late August to early September, with each played over two weeks. The Australian and the United States tournaments are played on hard courts, the French on clay, and Wimbledon on grass. Wimbledon is the oldest tournament, founded in 1877, followed by the US in 1881, the French in 1891 (major in 1925), and the Australian in 1905, but it was not until 1925 that all four were held as officially sanctioned majors.
==History==

With the growing popularity of tennis, and with the hopes of unifying the sport&#x27;s rules internationally, the British and French tennis associations started discussions at their Davis Cup tie, and in October 1912 organized a meeting in Paris, joined by the Australasian, Austrian, Belgian, Spanish, and Swiss associations. They subsequently formed the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), holding their first meeting in 1913, joined by the Danish, German, Dutch, Russian, South African, and Swedish organizations. Voting rights were divided based on the perceived importance of the individual countries, with Great Britain&#x27;s Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) receiving the maximum six votes. Three tournaments were established, being designated as &quot;World Championships&quot;:
* World Grass Court Championships, played on grass courts.
* World Hard Court Championships, played on clay courts.
* World Covered Court Championships, played on an indoor wood surface.
The LTA was given the perpetual right to organize the World Grass Court Championships, to be held at Wimbledon, and France received permission to stage the World Hard Court Championships until 1916. Anthony Wilding of New Zealand won all three of these World Championships in 1913.

The United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) expressed disagreement over the power distribution within the ILTF and the designation of &quot;World Championship&quot; status to the British and French tournaments, and thus initially refused to join the Federation, choosing instead to be bystanders to their meetings. By the 1920s, with the World Covered Court Championships failing to attract top players and the growing success of American and Australian tennis, the ILTF worked to convince the USNLTA to join them, meeting their demand to drop the designation of &quot;World Championships&quot; from all three tournaments in March 1923, which led to the demise of both the World Covered Court Championships and the World Hard Court Championships. A new category of &quot;Official Championships&quot; was created for the national championships of Britain, France, Australia, and the US. By the 1930s, these four tournaments had become well defined as the most prestigious in the sport.

In 1933, Jack Crawford won the Australian, French, and Wimbledon Championships, leaving him just needing to win the last major event of the year, the U.S. Championships, to become the reigning champion of all four major tournaments, a feat described as &quot;a grand slam&quot; by sports columnist Alan J. Gould of &quot;The Reading Eagle&quot;, and later that year by John Kieran of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who stated that if Crawford won at Forest Hills it &quot;would be something like scoring a grand slam on the courts, doubled and vulnerable.&quot; The term &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27; originates from the card game contract bridge, where it is used for winning all possible tricks. In golf it was used for the first time to describe a total of four wins, specifically Bobby Jones&#x27; achievement of winning the four major golf tournaments of the era, which he accomplished in 1930. &quot;Grand Slam&quot; or &quot;Slam&quot; has since also become used to refer to the tournaments individually. The first player to win all four majors in a calendar year and thus complete a Grand Slam was Don Budge in 1938.

At the time, only amateur players were allowed to participate in the Grand Slam and other ILTF-sanctioned tournaments. Amateur standing, regulated by the ILTF alongside its associated national federations, forbade players from receiving prize money, earning pay by teaching tennis, being contracted by promoters and playing paid exhibition matches, though expense payments were allowed along with certain monies from sporting goods companies or other benefactors. Amateurs who &quot;defected&quot; to become professional were banned from competing in amateur tournaments and dropped from their national associations. The first major professional tour was established in 1926 by promoter C. C. Pyle with a troupe of American and French players, most notably Suzanne Lenglen, playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. Over the next decades many other head-to-head tours were run and professional tournaments established, with three, the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, French Pro Championship and Wembley Championships, standing out, and considered to have been the professional majors. By the 1950s, largely due to efforts of player/promoter Jack Kramer, this lucrative parallel circuit was luring in most of the star amateurs on the men&#x27;s side, much to the ire of the ILTF and organizers of the Grand Slam tournaments. It was an open secret that the top players who remained as amateurs were receiving undeclared under-the-table payments from tournament promoters, an arrangement tolerated by their national tennis associations to dissuade them from joining the pro ranks and secure their availability for the majors and Davis Cup. This system was derisively referred to as &#x27;shamateurism&#x27; that was seen as undermining the integrity of the sport. Ramanathan Krishnan and Roy Emerson, for example declined large contract offers from the professional promoters, with the latter stating that he was better paid in the amateur circuit.

Tensions over this status quo, which had been building for decades, finally came to a head in 1967. The first tournament open to professional tennis players played on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the Wimbledon Pro, was staged by the All England Lawn Tennis Club in August, offering a prize fund of US$45,000. The tournament was deemed very successful, with packed crowds and the play seen as being of higher quality than the amateur-only Wimbledon final held two weeks earlier. This success in combination with large signings of top players to two new professional tours—World Championship Tennis and the National Tennis League—convinced the LTA on the need for open tennis. After a British proposal for this at the annual ILTF meeting was voted down, the LTA revolted, and in its own annual meeting in December it voted overwhelmingly to admit players of all statuses to the 1968 Wimbledon Championships and other future tournaments in Britain, &quot;come hell or high water&quot;. The eventual backing of the USNLTA that came after a February 1968 vote forced the ILTF to yield and allow each nation to determine its own legislation regarding amateur and professional players, which it voted for in a special meeting in March 1968. This marked the start of the Open Era of tennis, with its first tournament, the 1968 British Hard Court Championships, beginning three weeks later on 22 April in Bournemouth, England, while the first open Grand Slam tournament, the 1968 French Open, was held in May.

Even after the advent of the Open Era, players including John McEnroe and Chris Evert have pointed out that skipping the Australian Open was the norm because of the travelling distance involved and the inconvenient dates close to Christmas and New Year. There were also the contracted professional players who had to skip some major events like the French Open in the 1970s because they were committed to the more profitable pro circuits. In one case, Australian players including Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall and Roy Emerson who had contracts with George MacCall&#x27;s National Tennis League were prevented from participating in the 1970 Australian Open because the financial guarantees were deemed insufficient.

Although it has been possible to complete a Grand Slam in most years and most disciplines since 1925, it was not possible from 1940 to 1945 because of interruptions at Wimbledon, the Australian and French Championships due to World War II, the years from 1970 to 1985 when there was no Australian tournament in mixed doubles, 1986 when there was no Australian Open, and 2020 when Wimbledon was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Tournaments==
The Grand Slam of tennis comprises these four major tournaments:
===Australian Open===
The Australian Open is the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, played annually in late January and early February. The inaugural edition took place in November 1905 on the grass courts of the Warehouseman&#x27;s Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Australia. It was held as the Australasian Championships until 1927 and thereafter as the Australian Championships until the onset of the Open Era in 1969, passing through various venues in Australia and New Zealand before settling at the Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club in Melbourne between 1972 and 1987. Since 1988, it has been played on the hard courts of the Melbourne Park sports complex, which currently uses GreenSet as its court manufacturer.

Managed by Tennis Australia, formerly the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA), the tournament struggled until the mid-1980s to attract the top international players due to its distance from Europe and America and proximity to the Christmas and holiday season, but it has since grown to become one of the biggest sporting events in the Southern Hemisphere and the highest attended Grand Slam tournament, with more than 1,020,000 people attending the 2024 edition.
Nicknamed the &quot;Happy Slam&quot; and billed as &quot;the Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific&quot;, it has become known for its modernity and innovation, being the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play and install retractable roofs on its main courts, the first to schedule night-time men&#x27;s singles finals, and the first to substitute electronic line calling for line judges, using an expanded version of the Hawk-Eye technology known as &quot;Hawk-Eye Live&quot;.

The tournament was designated a major championship by the International Lawn Tennis Federation in 1923. Nowadays, its draws host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2024 tournament being A$86,500,000.

===French Open===
The French Open, also known as Roland Garros, is the second Grand Slam tournament of the year, played annually in late May and early June. A French championships closed event (restricted to members of French clubs) was first held in 1891 on the sand courts of the Societé de Sport de Île de Puteaux, in Puteaux, Île-de-France, and changed venues over the years. In 1925 the French championships became open to all amateurs and since 1928 has been held on clay courts at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France. Both the venue and the tournament are named &quot;Roland Garros&quot; after the pioneering French aviator.

Organized by the &quot;Fédération française de tennis&quot; (FFT), formerly known as the &quot;Fédération Française de Lawn Tennis&quot; until 1976, the French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament played on a red clay surface. It is generally considered to be the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world.

The World Hard Court Championships was considered the premier clay championship in France from 1912–1923 (apart from one year held in Belgium) as it admitted international competitors, and it is therefore often seen as the true precursor to the French Open before 1925. The French championships was first held as an International Lawn Tennis Federation–sanctioned major championship in 1925.

Today, it has draws that host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2024 tournament being €53,478,000. The 2018 edition saw a record attendance of 480,575 spectators.

===Wimbledon===
The Wimbledon Championships, commonly known as Wimbledon, is the third Grand Slam tournament of the year, played annually in late June and early July. It was first held in 1877 at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, at the time located off Nursery Road in Wimbledon, London, England. The tournament has always been contested at this club, which moved to its present site off Church Road in 1922 in order to increase its attendance capacity.

Wimbledon is organized by a committee of management consisting of nineteen members, with twelve being club members and the remaining seven nominated by the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA). As the world&#x27;s oldest tennis event, it is widely regarded as the most prestigious tennis tournament, and it is known for its commitment to longstanding traditions and guidelines. It is one of few tournaments and the only Grand Slam event that is still played on grass courts, tennis&#x27;s original surface, and where &quot;lawn tennis&quot; originated in the 1800s. Players are required to wear all-white attire during matches, and they are referred to as &quot;Gentlemen&quot; and &quot;Ladies&quot;. There is also a tradition where the players are asked to bow or curtsy towards the Royal Box upon entering or leaving Centre Court when either the Prince of Wales or the monarch are present.

The tournament was given the title &quot;World Grass Court Championships&quot; by the International Lawn Tennis Federation between 1912 and 1923, and was designated a major championship following the abolition of the three ILTF World Championships. Since 1937, the BBC has broadcast the tournament on television in the United Kingdom, with the finals shown live and in full on television in the country each year. The BBC&#x27;s broadcast of the 1967 edition was among the first colour television broadcasts in the UK.

Today, the event has draws that host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2021 tournament being £35,016,000, and 500,397 people attending the 2019 edition. The tournament has some of the longest running sponsorships in sports history, having been associated with Slazenger since 1902, and with the Robinsons fruit drink brand since 1935.

===US Open===
The US Open is the fourth and final Grand Slam tournament of the year, played annually in late August and early September. It was first held in August 1881 on grass courts at the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island, United States. The tournament changed venues in its early years, with each discipline continuing to be held separately at various venues until 1923, when the tournament settled at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. In 1978, it moved to the hardcourts of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, where it has been contested ever since.

Organized by the United States Tennis Association (USTA), previously known as the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) until 1920, and as United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USLTA) until 1975, it is the only Grand Slam tournament to have been played every year since its inception. In 1997, Arthur Ashe Stadium, the largest tennis stadium in the world with a capacity of 23,771 spectators, was opened. It is named after Arthur Ashe, the winner of the 1968 tournament—the first in which professionals were allowed to compete.

Over the years, the tournament has pioneered changes that other tournaments later adopted, including the introduction of a tiebreak system to decide the outcome of sets tied at 6–6 in 1970, being the first Grand Slam tournament to award equal prize money to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events in 1975, the installation of floodlights in 1975 in order to allow matches to be played at night, and the introduction of instant replay reviews of line calls using the Hawk-Eye computer system in 2006.

The ILTF officially designated it as a major tournament in 1923. Today, the event has draws that host 256 singles players, 128 doubles teams and 32 mixed doubles teams, with the total prize money for the 2020 tournament being US$53,400,000, and a US television viewership of 700,000. From 2004-2023, the tournament was preceded by the US Open Series, composed of North American hardcourt professional tournaments that lead up to and culminate with the US Open itself. The season was organized by the USTA as a way to focus more attention on American tennis tournaments by getting more of them on domestic television.

==Grand Slam==

A Grand Slam (sometimes called a Calendar-year Grand Slam, Calendar Grand Slam, or Calendar Slam) is the achievement of winning the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open in the same year. Margaret Court is the only player to complete a Grand Slam in two disciplines, singles and mixed doubles (twice), while wheelchair players Diede de Groot and Dylan Alcott have completed one in both the singles and doubles disciplines of their respective classes.

The following is a list of players that achieved it.

=== Non-calendar-year Grand Slam ===
In 1982, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) began offering a $1 million bonus to any singles player to win the four majors consecutively regardless the tournaments order of winning them while the Men&#x27;s International Professional Tennis Council, which was the governing body of men&#x27;s professional tennis at the time, stated that &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27; need not necessarily be won in the same year. This revision by the Council and reportedly the ITF was approved by the representatives of the four Grand Slam tournaments at Wimbledon. Neil Amdur and Allison Danzig of the New York Times both criticised the changed definition of the term Grand Slam, whereas in 1985 Hal Bock of Associated Press backed the change. 
Despite newspaper reports claiming that ITF President Philippe Chatrier had said &quot;the four big events no longer have to be won in the same calendar year for a player to be recognized as Grand Slam champion&quot;, ITF General Secretary David Gray in a 1983 letter claimed that it was never the intention of ITF to alter anything regarding the definition of the classic Grand Slam:

When Martina Navratilova won the 1984 French Open and became the reigning champion of all four women&#x27;s singles discipline, she was the first player to receive the bonus prize in recognition of her achievement. Some media outlets said that she had won a Grand Slam. Curry Kirkpatrick of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote &quot;Whether the Slam was Grand or Bland or a commercial sham tainted with an asterisk the size of a tennis ball, Martina Navratilova finally did it.&quot;

When Rafael Nadal was on the verge of completing a non-calendar-year Grand Slam at the 2011 Australian Open, one writer observed, &quot;Most traditionalists insist that the &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27; should refer only to winning all four titles in a calendar year, although the constitution of the International Tennis Federation, the sports governing body, spells out that &#x27;players who hold all four of these titles at the same time achieve the Grand Slam&#x27;.&quot; In 2012 the ambiguity was resolved, with the ITF&#x27;s current constitution stating &quot;The Grand Slam titles are the championships of Australia, France, the United States of America and Wimbledon. Players who hold all four of these titles in one calendar year achieve the &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27;.&quot;

Combining the Grand Slam and the non-calendar-year Grand Slam, only eight singles players on 11 occasions achieved the feat of being the reigning champion of all four majors, three men (Don Budge, Rod Laver, Novak Djokovic) and five women (Maureen Connolly, Margaret Court, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams).

The following list is for those players who achieved a non-calendar-year Grand Slam by holding the four major titles at the same time but not in the calendar year. Players who completed a Grand Slam within the same streak as a non-calendar-year Grand Slam are not included here.

=== Career Grand Slam ===

The career achievement of winning all four major championships in one discipline is termed a &quot;Career Grand Slam&quot;, or &quot;Career Slam&quot;. In singles, eight men (Fred Perry, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic) and ten women (Maureen Connolly, Doris Hart, Shirley Fry Irvin, Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams, and Maria Sharapova) have completed a Career Grand Slam. Four men (Emerson, Laver, Djokovic, and Nadal) and five women (Court, Evert, Navratilova, Graf, Williams) have achieved the feat more than once over the course of their careers.

Only six players have completed a Career Grand Slam in both singles and doubles: one male (Roy Emerson) and five females (Margaret Court, Doris Hart, Shirley Fry Irvin, Martina Navratilova, and Serena Williams).

=== Boxed Set ===
A &quot;Boxed Set&quot; refers to winning one of every possible major title in the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles disciplines throughout a player&#x27;s career. Only three players have completed a Boxed Set, all females: Doris Hart, Margaret Court, and Martina Navratilova. Court&#x27;s second Boxed Set, completed in 1969, spans the Amateur and Open Eras, but she later completed a set entirely within the Open Era in 1973.




=== Golden Slam ===
The term &quot;Golden Slam&quot; (also known as &quot;Golden Grand Slam&quot;, &quot;Calendar-year Golden Slam&quot; or &quot;Calendar Golden Slam&quot;) refers to the achievement of winning all four majors and the Olympic or Paralympic gold medal in a calendar year. The achievement was first established in 1988, when Steffi Graf won all the aforementioned titles in singles. She is currently the only singles able-bodied player to achieve it, while Diede de Groot and Dylan Alcott also accomplished the feat, in wheelchair singles and wheelchair quad singles respectively.

*Non-calendar-year Golden Slam: refers to the achievement of winning all four majors and the Olympic or Paralympic gold medal consecutively across two calendar years. It has been used since 2013, when Bob and Mike Bryan won the aforementioned titles consecutively in doubles between 2012 and 2013. Their achievement was also dubbed the &quot;Golden Bryan Slam&quot;.

*Career Golden Slam: refers to the achievement of winning all four majors and the Olympic or Paralympic gold medal during their career.
=== Other concepts ===
*Super Slam: Combination of the Golden Slam and year-end championship title (ATP Finals for the men&#x27;s tour, WTA Finals for the women&#x27;s tour, and the Wheelchair Tennis Masters for the wheelchair tennis tour) in a calendar year, also known as &quot;Calendar-year Super Slam&quot; or &quot;Calendar Super Slam&quot;. Diede de Groot is currently the only player to do so, in women&#x27;s wheelchair singles in 2021.
*Non-calendar-year Super Slam: refers to the achievement of winning all four majors, the Olympic or Paralympic gold medal, and the year-end championship consecutively across two calendar years. Steffi Graf is currently the only one to achieve it, with her Golden Slam in 1988 following her victory at the year-end championship in 1987. 
*Career Super Slam: refers to the achievement of winning all four majors, the Olympic or Paralympic gold medal, and the year-end championship throughout a career.
*Three-Quarter Slam: refers to the achievement of winning three of the four majors in a calendar year, missing out on the Grand Slam by only one title.
*Surface Slam: refers to the achievement of winning a major title on each of three current surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts) in a calendar year. It&#x27;s been possible since 1978, when the US Open changed its playing surface from clay to hard courts. From 1978 to 1987, the Australian Open and Wimbledon were played on grass, the French Open on clay and the US Open on hard, but since 1988 the Australian Open has also been played on hard courts.

*Channel Slam: refers to the achievement of winning both the French Open and Wimbledon in a calendar year. The name makes reference to the English Channel, the body of water separating France from the United Kingdom, the host countries of the French Open and Wimbledon. These tournaments are held clay and grass courts, respectively, surfaces very different from each other, usually being held a few weeks from each other, meaning that players who have deep runs in the French Open have little time to adapt to the different surface conditions found at Wimbledon.&lt;ref name=&quot;B/R&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Pro Slam ===
Before the start of the Open Era in 1968, only amateur players were allowed to compete in the four Grand Slam tournaments. Many male top players &quot;went pro&quot; in order to win prize money legally, competing on a professional world tour comprising completely separate events. From 1927 to 1967, the three tournaments considered by many to have been the &quot;majors&quot; of the professional tour were:
* U.S. Pro Tennis Championships,
* French Pro Championship,
* Wembley Championships.

A player who won all three in a calendar year was considered retrospectively to have achieved a &quot;Professional Grand Slam&quot;, or &quot;Pro Slam&quot;. In the pre-open era the terms did not exist. The feat was accomplished by Ken Rosewall in 1963 and Rod Laver in 1967, while Ellsworth Vines, Hans Nüsslein and Don Budge have won the three major trophies during their careers. The professional majors did not have a women&#x27;s draw except for the Cleveland tournament in 1953, 1955, 1956, 1959.

<text>An inquisitorial system is a legal system in which the court, or a part of the court, is actively involved in investigating the facts of the case. This is distinct from an adversarial system, in which the role of the court is primarily that of an impartial referee between the prosecution and the defense.

Inquisitorial systems are used primarily in countries with civil legal systems, such as France and Italy, or legal systems based on Islamic law like Saudi Arabia, rather than in common law systems. It is the prevalent legal system in Continental Europe, Latin America, African countries not formerly under British rule, East Asia (except Hong Kong), Indochina, Thailand, and Indonesia. Most countries with an inquisitorial system also have some form of civil code as their main source of law. Countries using common law, including the United States, may use an inquisitorial system for summary hearings in the case of misdemeanors or infractions, such as minor traffic violations.

The distinction between an adversarial and inquisitorial system is theoretically unrelated to the distinction between a civil legal and common-law system. Some legal scholars consider &quot;inquisitorial&quot; misleading, and prefer the word nonadversarial. The function is often vested in the office of the public procurator, as in China, Japan, and Germany.

==Overview==

In an inquisitorial system, the trial judges (mostly plural in serious crimes) are inquisitors who actively participate in fact-finding public inquiry by questioning defense lawyers, prosecutors, and witnesses. They could even order certain pieces of evidence to be examined if they find presentation by the defense or prosecution to be inadequate. Prior to the case getting to trial, magistrate judges (&quot;juges d&#x27;instruction&quot; in France) participate in the investigation of a case, often assessing material by police and consulting with the prosecutor. 

The inquisitorial system applies to questions of criminal procedure at trial, not substantive law; that is, it determines how criminal inquiries and trials are conducted, not the kind of crimes for which one can be prosecuted or the sentences that they carry. It is most readily used in some civil legal systems. However, some jurists do not recognize this dichotomy, and see procedure and substantive legal relationships as being interconnected and part of a theory of justice as applied differently in various legal cultures.

In an adversarial system, judges focus on the issues of law and procedure and act as a referee in the contest between the defense and the prosecution. Juries decide matters of fact, and sometimes matters of the law. Neither judge nor jury can initiate an inquiry, and judges rarely ask witnesses questions directly during trial. In some United States jurisdictions, it is common practice for jurors to submit questions to the court that they believe were not resolved in direct or cross-examination. After testimony and other evidence are presented and summarized in arguments, the jury will declare a verdict (literally &quot;true statement&quot;) and in some jurisdictions the reasoning behind the verdict; however, discussions among jurors cannot be made public except in extraordinary circumstances. 

Appeals on the basis of factual issues, such as sufficiency of the sum total of evidence that was properly admitted, are subject to a standard of review that is in most jurisdictions deferential to the judgment of the fact-finder at trial, be that a judge or a jury. The failure of a prosecutor to disclose evidence to the defense, for example, or a violation of the defendant&#x27;s constitutional rights (legal representation, right to remain silent, an open and public trial) can trigger a dismissal or re-trial. In some adversarial jurisdictions (e.g., the United States, and England and Wales), a prosecutor cannot appeal a &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict (absent corruption or gross malfeasance by the court).

In adversarial systems, the defendant may plead &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;no contest,&quot; in exchange for reduced sentences, a practice known as plea bargaining, or a plea deal, which is an extremely common practice in the United States. In theory, the defendant must allocute or &quot;voice&quot; his or her crimes in open court, and the judge must believe the defendant is telling the truth about his or her guilt. In an inquisitorial system, a confession of guilt would not be regarded as ground for a guilty verdict. The prosecutor is required to provide evidence supporting a guilty verdict. But this requirement is not unique to inquisitorial systems, as many or most adversarial systems impose a similar requirement under the name &quot;corpus delicti&quot;.

==History==

Until the development of the Catholic Medieval Inquisition in the 12th century, the legal systems used in medieval Europe generally relied on the adversarial system to determine whether someone should be tried and whether a person was guilty or innocent. Under this system, unless people were caught in the act of committing crimes, they could not be tried until they had been formally accused by their victim, the voluntary accusations of a sufficient number of witnesses, or by an inquest (an early form of grand jury) convened specifically for that purpose. A weakness of this system was that, because it relied on the voluntary accusations of witnesses, and because the penalties for making a false accusation were severe, victims and would-be witnesses could be hesitant to make accusations to the court, for fear of implicating themselves. Because of the difficulties in deciding cases, procedures such as trial by ordeal or combat were accepted.

Beginning in 1198, Pope Innocent III issued a series of decretals that reformed the ecclesiastical court system. Under the new (inquisitional procedure), an ecclesiastical magistrate no longer required a formal accusation to summon and try a defendant. Instead, an ecclesiastical court could summon and interrogate witnesses of its own initiative. If the (possibly secret) testimony of those witnesses accused a person of a crime, that person could be summoned and tried. In 1215, the Fourth Council of the Lateran affirmed the use of the inquisitional system. The council forbade clergy from conducting trials by ordeal or combat. 

As a result, in parts of continental Europe, the ecclesiastical courts operating under the inquisitional procedure became the dominant method by which disputes were adjudicated. In France, the — lay courts — also employed inquisitorial proceedings.

In England, however, King Henry II had established separate secular courts during the 1160s. While the ecclesiastical courts of England, like those on the continent, adopted the inquisitional system, the secular common law courts continued to operate under the adversarial system. The adversarial principle that a person could not be tried until formally accused continued to apply for most criminal cases. In 1215 this principle became enshrined as article 38 of the Magna Carta: &quot;No bailiff for the future shall, upon his own unsupported complaint, put anyone to his law, without credible witnesses brought for this purposes.&quot;

The first territory to wholly adopt the inquisitional system was the Holy Roman Empire. The new German legal process was introduced as part of the of 1498 and then the of 1507. The adoption of the ( of Charles V) in 1532 made inquisitional procedures empirical law. It was not until Napoleon introduced the on 16 November 1808, that the classical procedures of inquisition were ended in all German territories.

In the development of modern legal institutions that took place in the 19th century, for the most part jurisdictions codified their private law and criminal law, and reviewed and codified the rules of civil procedure as well. It was through this development that the role of an inquisitorial system became enshrined in most European civilian legal systems. However, there exist significant differences of operating methods and procedures between 18th-century courts and 19th-century courts. In particular, limits on the powers of investigators were typically added, as well as increased rights of the defense.

It is too much of a generalization to say that the civil law is purely inquisitorial and the common law adversarial. The ancient Roman custom of arbitration has now been adapted in many common-law jurisdictions to a more inquisitorial form. In some mixed civil law systems, such as those in Scotland, Quebec, and Louisiana, while the substantive law is civil in nature and evolution, the procedural codes that have developed over the last few hundred years are based upon the English adversarial system.

==Modern usage==

===France===
The main feature of the inquisitorial system in criminal justice in France, and other countries functioning along the same lines, is the function of the examining or investigating judge (), also called a magistrate judge. The examining judge conducts investigations into serious crimes or complex inquiries. As a member of the judiciary, they are independent and outside the province of the executive branch, and therefore separate from the Office of Public Prosecutions, which is supervised by the Minister of Justice.

Despite high media attention and frequent portrayals in TV series, examining judges are active in a small minority of cases. In 2005, there were 1.1 million criminal rulings in France, while only 33,000 new cases were investigated by judges. The vast majority of cases are therefore investigated directly by law enforcement agencies (police, gendarmerie) under the supervision of the Office of Public Prosecutions (&quot;procureurs&quot;).

Examining judges are used for serious crimes, e.g., murder and rape, and for crimes involving complexity, such as embezzlement, misuse of public funds, and corruption. The case may be brought before the examining judge either by the public prosecutor (&quot;procureur&quot;) or, more rarely, by the victim (who may compel an &quot;instruction&quot; even if the public prosecutor rules the charges to be insufficient).

The judge questions witnesses, interrogates suspects, and orders searches for other investigations. Their role is not to prosecute the accused, but to gather facts, and as such their duty is to look for any and all evidence, whether incriminating or exculpatory (&quot;à charge et à décharge&quot;). Both the prosecution and the defense may request the judge to act, and may appeal the judge&#x27;s decisions before an appellate court. The scope of the inquiry is limited by the mandate given by the prosecutor&#x27;s office: the examining judge cannot open a criminal investigation &quot;sua sponte.&quot;

In the past the examining judge could order committal of the accused, this power being subject to appeal. However, this is no longer authorized, and other judges have to approve a committal order.

If the examining judge decides there is a valid case against a suspect, the accused is sent for adversarial trial by jury. The examining judge does not sit on the trial court which tries the case and is prohibited from sitting for future cases involving the same defendant. The case is tried before the court in a manner similar to that of adversarial courts: the prosecution (and on occasion a plaintiff) seeks the conviction of accused criminals, the defense attempts to rebut the prosecution claims, and the judge and jury draw their conclusions from the evidence presented at trial.

As a result of judicial investigation and defendants being able to have judicial proceedings dismissed on procedural grounds during the examining phase, cases where the evidence is weak tend not to reach the trial stage. Conversely, the guilty plea and plea bargaining were until recently unknown to French law. They are accepted only for crimes for which the prosecution seeks a sentence not exceeding one year imprisonment. Therefore, most cases go to trial, including cases where the prosecution is almost sure to gain a conviction. In countries such as the United States, the latter cases would be settled by plea bargain.

==Other types==

===Administrative justice===
In administrative courts, such as the Conseil d&#x27;État, litigation proceedings are markedly more inquisitorial. Most of the procedure is conducted in writing; the plaintiff writes to the court, which requests explanations from the administration or public service concerned; when answered, the court may then request further detail from the plaintiff, etc. When the case is sufficiently complete, the lawsuit opens in court; however, the parties are not required to attend the court hearing. This method reflects the fact that administrative lawsuits are for the most part about matters of formal procedure and technicalities.

===Inquisitorial tribunals within the United States===
Certain administrative proceedings within some common-law jurisdictions in the United States may be similar to their civil law counterparts but are conducted on a more inquisitorial model. For instance tribunals dealing with minor traffic violations at the New York City Traffic Violations Bureau are held before an adjudicator, who also functions as a prosecutor. They question witnesses before rendering judgements and setting fines.

These types of tribunals or boards function as an expedited form of justice, in which the state agents conduct an initial investigation and the adjudicator&#x27;s job is to confirm these preliminary findings through a simplified form of procedure that grants some basic amount of due process or fundamental justice. The accused party has an opportunity to place his or her objections on the record.

<doc id="197653" wikidata="Q356933" url="?curid=197653" title="François Christophe de Kellermann">
<text>François-Étienne-Christophe Kellermann or de Kellermann, 1st Duke of [[Valmy]] (; 28 May 1735 – 23 September 1820) was a French military commander, later the Général d&#x27;Armée, a Marshal of the Empire and freemason. Marshal Kellermann served in varying roles throughout the entirety of two epochal conflicts, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. Kellermann is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 3.

==Early life==
François Christophe de Kellermann came from a Saxon family, which was long settled in Strasbourg and ennobled. He was the only son of a family living in the French province of Alsace. His father was François de Kellermann (or Johann Christoph Edler von Kellermann) and his mother, Baroness Marie Magdalene von Dyhrn.

==Military career prior to the Revolution==
The fifteen-year-old François Kellermann entered the French Army as a cadet volunteer with a hussar regiment: the &quot;Régiment de Loweridath&quot;. He was commissioned as an ensign in the &quot;Royal-Bavière&quot; infantry regiment and promoted to captain in 1758 in the course of the Seven Years&#x27; War. On one occasion he distinguished himself by capturing 300 prisoners while leading a small cavalry detachment. In 1771, Kellermann saw active service in Poland, becoming a chevalier of the Order of Saint-Louis. A further promotion to &quot;capitaine-commandant&quot; followed in 1776 before he became major in the Hussars of Conflans (&quot;Hussards de Conflans&quot;) three years later. Kellermann became brigadier-general in 1784, and in the following year &quot;marechal-de-camp&quot;. While a number of Napoleon&#x27;s marshals served in the Royal army prior to the Revolution, Kellermann was the only one to have reached such senior rank under the former regime.

==Revolutionary career==
In 1789 Kellermann enthusiastically embraced the cause of the French Revolution, and in 1791 became general of the army in Alsace. In April 1792 he was made a lieutenant-general, and in August of the same year there came to him the opportunity of his lifetime. He rose to the occasion, and his victory over the Prussians at the Battle of Valmy, in Goethe&#x27;s words, &quot;opened a new era in the history of the world&quot;. Napoleon later commented that: &quot;I think I&#x27;m the boldest general that ever lived, but I daren&#x27;t take post on that ridge with windmill at Valmy (where Kellermann took position) in 1793&quot;.

Transferred to the army on the Moselle, Kellermann was accused by General Adam Custine of neglecting to support his operations on the Rhine; but he was acquitted at the bar of the National Convention in Paris, and placed at the head of the army of the Alps and of Italy, in which position he showed himself a careful commander and excellent administrator.

Shortly afterwards he received instructions to reduce Lyons, then in revolt against the convention, but shortly after the surrender he was imprisoned in Paris for thirteen months, during The Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, he was acquitted and reinstated in his command, and did good service in maintaining the south-eastern border against the Austrians until his army was merged into that of General Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy.

==Imperial career==

Kellermann was then sixty-two years of age, still physically equal to his work, but the young generals who had come to the front in the previous two years represented the new spirit and the new art of war, and Kellermann&#x27;s active career came to an end. But the hero of Valmy was never forgotten. When Napoleon came to power Kellermann was named successively senator (1800), president of the Senate (1801), honorary Marshal of France (19 May 1804), and title of Duke of Valmy (1808).
In his service to the First French Empire, Kellermann was frequently employed in the administration and training of the army. He also took control of the line of communications and the command of reserve troops, and his long and wide experience made him one of Napoleon&#x27;s most valuable assistants.

In 1814 he voted for the deposition of the emperor and became a peer under the royal government of Louis XVIII. After the &quot;Hundred Days&quot; he sat in the Chamber of Peers and voted with the Liberals.

Marshal Kellermann died in Paris on 23 September 1820, and is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

His son François Étienne de Kellermann, 2nd Duke of Valmy, also fought for Napoleon and was promoted to cavalry general after the Battle of Marengo. Kellermann&#x27;s grandson was the politician François Christophe Edmond de Kellermann and his sister Magdalena married the Black Viennese courtier Angelo Soliman.

<text>Parquet (; French for &quot;a small compartment&quot;) is a geometric mosaic of wood pieces used for decorative effect in flooring.

Parquet patterns are often entirely geometrical and angular—squares, triangles, lozenges—but may contain curves. The most popular parquet flooring pattern is herringbone.

==Etymology==

The word derives from the Old French &quot;parchet&quot; (the diminutive of &quot;parc&quot;), literally meaning &quot;a small enclosed space&quot;.

==History==

Large diagonal squares known as &quot;parquet de Versailles&quot; were introduced in 1684 as &quot;parquet de menuiserie&quot; (&quot;woodwork parquet&quot;) to replace the marble flooring that required constant washing, which tended to rot the joists beneath the floors. Such &quot;parquets en losange&quot; were noted by the Swedish architect Daniel Cronström at Versailles and at the Grand Trianon in 1693.

==Materials==
Woods contrasting in color and grain, such as oak, walnut, cherry, lime, pine, maple etc. are sometimes employed, and in the more expensive kinds the richly coloured mahogany and sometimes other tropical hardwoods are also used. While not technically a wood, bamboo is also a popular material for modern floors.

Parquet floors were formerly usually adhered with hot bitumen. Today modern cold adhesives are usually used.

==Repair==
Parquet floors are usually long lasting if maintained correctly. Unstuck blocks are re-glued. Bitumen-glued blocks require use of either hot bitumen, cold bitumen emulsion, or a spirit based parquet adhesive.

==Domestic use==
Parquet floors are often found in bedrooms and hallways. They are considered better than regular floor tiles since they feel warmer underfoot. However they do little to absorb sounds such as walking, vacuum cleaning and television, which can cause problems in multi-occupancy dwellings.

==Basketball courts==

One of the most famous parquet floors is that used by the Boston Celtics of the NBA. The original floor, which was installed at the Celtics&#x27; original home of Boston Arena in 1946, was moved intact to Boston Garden in 1952 and used there until the team moved to what was then known as FleetCenter in 1995, now known as TD Garden. The floor remained intact and in use until it was cut up and sold as souvenirs in 1999, after the 1998 demolition of Boston Garden. The Celtics today play on a parquet floor inside TD Garden that combines old and new sections. In 2018, the Celtics constructed a new parquet floor for use in their new Auerbach Center practice facility. It is the only NBA court floor made from red oak; all others are made from rock maple. In 2023, the Celtics played on a traditional maple court at home for the first time during the 2023 NBA in-season tournament. The Celtics petitioned the NBA to include the parquet pattern on its in-season tournament court, but were denied.

Similar square-paneled parquet floors, albeit in maple, were made for the Orlando Magic, Minnesota Timberwolves, Denver Nuggets, and New Jersey Nets. Of the four, only the Magic continue to use a square-paneled parquet floor, which was first used at the Orlando Arena in 1989 and later moved to Amway Center (now Kia Center) in 2010. The Nets debuted their parquet at the Meadowlands Arena in 1988, and continued to use the floor until 1997; the floor remained in use with the Seton Hall basketball team until 2007. The Nuggets used a parquet floor from 1990 to 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena, while the Timberwolves played on a parquet floor from 1996 to 2008 at the Target Center.

In 1995, the Toronto Raptors debuted with a herringbone parquet, and used the floor until 1999 while playing in three different home venues: SkyDome (now Rogers Centre), Copps Coliseum (now FirstOntario Centre) and Maple Leaf Gardens. The now-Brooklyn Nets introduced chevron parquet flooring upon moving to the Barclays Center in 2012. However, its sister WNBA team (since 2019), the New York Liberty, continues to use a traditional floor at the venue.

While the Charlotte Hornets unveiled a parquet-like floor at the Time Warner Cable Arena for the 2014–15 season, it is not considered a true parquet floor. Instead, it simulated the pattern of the parquet by alternately painting light and dark trapezoid sections through the use of varnish, forming a beehive pattern that is synonymous with the franchise. In 2021, the Hornets changed its court design, relegating the trapezoids to midcourt.

There are a handful of basketball courts in NCAA college basketball that have consistently featured parquet floors. Wake Forest University&#x27;s Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum has generally featured a parquet floor since its opening in 1989. The University of Iowa&#x27;s Carver-Hawkeye Arena has generally featured a parquet floor since its opening in 1983.

<text>A ski binding is a device that connects a ski boot to the ski. Before the 1933 invention of ski lifts, skiers went uphill and down and cross-country on the same gear. As ski lifts became more prevalent, skis—and their bindings—became increasingly specialized, differentiated between alpine (downhill) and Nordic (cross-country, Telemark, and ski jumping) styles of skiing. Until the point of divergence in the mid-20th century, bindings held the toe of a flexible, leather boot against the ski and allowed the heel to rise off the ski, typically with a form of strap or cable around the heel. 

To address injuries resulting from falls while skiing downhill on such equipment, ski bindings emerged with the ability to release the toe of the boot sideways, in early models, and to release the boot forward and aft, in later models. Downhill ski bindings became standardized to fit plastic ski boots and incorporated a built-in brake that drags in the snow after the ski detaches from the boot.

Cross-country ski bindings evolved from being simple, bent-metal attachment plates with pins, which held a square-toed leather boot toe under a wire bale, to becoming standardized systems that held a plastic boot, attached to a bar in a recess in the boot&#x27;s toe.

Back-country, jumping, and alpine touring ski bindings incorporate features found in alpine and Nordic bindings.

==History==
Prior to the 1840s, ski bindings were a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot, similar to those used for snowshoes.

=== Norheim—ca. 1850 ===
Sondre Norheim demonstrated telemark skiing before 1866, and the Open Christiania turn in 1868, both made possible with a binding design which dated back to the late 1840s. This added a loop of twisted birch roots that ran from the existing birch root toe loops around the boot heels and back. This allowed the heel to lift as before, for walking and gliding, but better held the boots to the skis allowing greater control. This enabled Norheim to control the skis with his feet and legs, replacing the former technique of dragging a large pole in the snow on one side or the other to drag the skier in that direction. This control led to the development of the telemark and stem christie ski turns.

=== Huitfeldt—1894 ===

Starting in 1894, Fritz R. Huitfeldt invented a binding with a secure toe iron which allowed the heel to move freely and evolved through the 1930s as the standard design. His innovations included:

* Adding vertical metal brackets on either side of the ski to hold the ski boot (1894), augmented in 1897 by passing the iron bracket through a rectangular hole from one side of the ski to the other, before bending up the tabs.
* Passing toe straps through the rectangular hole and providing a buckle over the top of the boots, attached to the brackets and firmly bind the boot in place.
* Passing a strap over the free heel, augmented in 1904 with a cam lever substitute for the buckle over the heel, called the &quot;Hoyer-Ellefsen toggle&quot;.

Skiers wishing to affix their heel to the ski, employed a &quot;long-thong&quot; strap. Further innovations included:

* Mathias Zdarsky&#x27;s development of a ski binding that replaced the heel strap with a long metal plate under the sole of the boot, hinged at the front to allow the heel to rise, in the early 1900s. The heel was held to the plate by a short strap attaching at the back.
* Marius Eriksen&#x27;s 1920 introduction of pre-formed plates that were screwed on top of the ski.
* Guido Ruege&#x27;s 1929 invention of the Kandahar binding, which incorporated a front-throw lever that tightened the heel cable past the ski-mounted toe brackets and became known as the cable binding.

=== Rottefella—1927 ===
The Rottefella binding was developed in 1927 by Bror With. &quot;Rottefella&quot; means &quot;rat trap&quot; in Norwegian. A bent, pressed-metal plate had three or four pins that stuck into the toe of a square-toed boot, which was clamped down with a metal bail. After victories at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, the binding remained the standard type for cross-country skiing through much of the century and continues as the Nordic Norm, manufactured by Rottefella and other companies.

=== Cable—1929 ===
The introduction of the cable binding allowed the Christie turn to become a standard on downhill runs, and to further support this style of skiing the Swiss racer Guido Reuge in 1929 invented a cable binding with steel clips below the boot heel to enable clamping the heel down for downhill portions. He named the product &quot;Kandahar&quot; for the international Kandahar Cup ski races. In use in alpine races, the Kandahar binding led to serious leg injuries, and by 1939 experimentation began in earnest on bindings that would release the boot in a fall.

=== Saf-Ski—1937 ===
Hjalmar Hvam broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding in 1937, which he later sold under the slogan &quot;Hvoom with Hvam&quot;. This was a metal clip with a pyramidal top that fit into a slot cut into the sole of the ski boot. When the boot was rotated forward, the slot on the toe eventually rose above the metal pyramid, allowing the toe to release from the ski. The system was considered with suspicion by professional skiers, especially when Olaf Rodegaard released during a race. However, Rodegaard credited the release with saving him from a broken leg. In the post-war era, Hvam sold several thousand pairs of Saf-Skis, in an era when alpine skiing was in its infancy. Hvam continued to sell the Saf-Ski into the 1960s, but in 1966 his insurance rates increased so dramatically that he was forced from the market.

=== Look Nevada—1950 ===
The introduction of the Look Nevada in 1950 represented a significant advance in ski bindings. The Nevada held the toe centred over the ski using two metal fingers shaped into an upside-down V. The fingers were pivoted to allow motion to the sides, and centred with a spring. During a fall, sideways torsion could overcome the force of the spring and allow the boot to release directly to the side. This design was quickly copied by other vendors, notably Marker, and had the first real impact on the dominance of the fixed-toe bindings. By the late 1950s, there were about 35 different release toe bindings on the US market, most of which used a normal Kandahar-style heel cable.

=== Cubco—1950 ===
The first modern heel-and-toe binding for alpine skiing was the Cubco binding, first introduced in 1950 but not popular until about 1960. A heel-release binding faced the problem that there was no obvious place to attach to on the heel, so the Cubco solved this by screwing small metal clips into the sole of the boot. This also eliminated the changes in performance as the sole of the boot wore down, or the geometry of the sole changed as the boot wore into the skier&#x27;s foot. 

===Heel-release—1960s===
Marker introduced the Rotomat, which gripped onto the sole where it extended past the heel, and Look quickly followed suit with their Grand Prix design. By the mid-1960s, release bindings that worked on both the heel and the toe were common, and by the late 1960s, the cable binding had disappeared from alpine skiing.

=== Plate systems—1970s ===
One problem with 1960s release bindings was that the boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led to the introduction of plate bindings, which used a metal plate firmly clipped to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the BURT Retractable Bindings and Spademan binding, but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As more and more of the alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records. 

=== Standardized plastic boot-compatible systems—1970s ===

The disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by Lange as a way of improving existing leather designs. As the new material spread through the industry, the sole piece was standardized to allow toe-and-heel bindings to clip on. Plastic had the advantages of being much firmer than leather, not changing shape over time, and having predictable friction characteristics wet or dry.The new boots and bindings could be easily adapted to any ski for any skier. Injury rates from alpine skiing began to fall with the gradual introduction of the Teflon anti-friction pad around 1972.

== Alpine ==
Alpine ski bindings have two functions: 1) Retaining the ski boot on the ski, 2) Releasing the ski boot from the ski in case of a fall to prevent injury to the skier. The retention function typically involves stepping into the binding toe-first and pressing down with the heel of the ski boot, which causes a latch to engage the heel. The release function has two principal axes of operation: forwards and back along the ski and torsionally, rotating over the top of the ski. Bindings allow a certain amount of flexure of the boot position before they release under pressure during a fall.

Each binding is set for a DIN value that determines how readily it will release in case of a fall, based on the parameters of the skier&#x27;s height, weight, age, and ability (rated from one for beginner to three for an advanced skier). A snow brake prevents the ski from moving while it is not attached to a boot. Major manufacturers of alpine ski bindings include:

* Atomic, (also branded &quot;Ess&quot;) pioneered the adjustable binding platform, forwards and back.
* Geze, which pioneered upward release of the toe, in case of a backwards fall.
* Look, which pioneered a turntable for the heel.
* Marker, which pioneered the toe-piece &quot;twin-cam&quot; articulation for releasing a boot sideways.
* Salomon, which pioneered the use of composite plastics in bindings.
* Tyrolia, which introduced the &quot;flex&quot; attachment system, using pins on the binding that engage holes in the boot.

===Alpine touring===

An alpine touring (or randonee) binding allows the skier to have the heel of the ski boot free and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using Nordic skiing techniques for ski touring, and to have both the heel and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using alpine skiing techniques to descend the mountain. Most touring bindings are designed for ski boots falling under one of two ISO specifications: 
*ISO 5355:2019, for traditional alpine boots. In this variation the pivot is located in the front of the binding.
*ISO 9523:2015, for boots in which the pivot is formed at the boot / binding interface.
The two setups are typically incompatible in that the principle by which they affix the boot to the ski is different. &quot;Tech&quot; bindings engage the ski boot with pins, which hold the toe down and engage with the heel in downhill mode. Approximately 50% of ski boots have the necessary inserts. &quot;Frame&quot; bindings function similarly to regular alpine bindings, gripping a welt in the heel of the boot in downhill mode.

Manufacturers of alpine touring bindings include: Atomic/Salomon, Black Diamond, Dynafit, Fritschi, Genuine Guide Gear, and Marker.

==Nordic==

Starting in the last half of the twentieth century, three standards for cross-country and telemark ski bindings emerged: The 75-mm Nordic Norm (NN), the Salomon Nordic System (SNS), and the New Nordic Norm (NNN). Ski jumping bindings are specialized to the sport. Companies that manufacture nordic bindings include Alpina, Fischer, Madshus, Rossignol, and Rottefella.

=== Nordic systems—1970s ===
Adidas explored an alternative to the Nordic Norm binding in 1975 with a tab protruding from the boot that was clamped down in a narrow plastic binding. Salomon produced a ski boot with a metal loop, protruding from the toe of the boot, which was clamped in its binding. This was followed with the 1979 Salomon Nordic System binding system, which attached to a bar embedded in a slot in the toe of the ski boot. This binding configuration was emulated by Rottefella and other manufacturers as the New Nordic Norm.

=== Nordic Norm (NN) ===
The incorporation of flexible plastics into ski boot soles allowed them to be strong torsionally and side-to-side, while retaining lengthwise flexibility and allowing the heel to rise as without the need for a cable about the heel. The Rottefella binding became standardized as the 75-mm, three-pin, Nordic Norm binding, which was widespread by the 1970s.

=== Salomon Nordic System (SNS) ===

The Salomon Nordic System (SNS) cross-country ski binding was the first integrated boot-binding system for cross-country skis, followed by the New Nordic Norm. The first generation (SNS) employed a looped bar protruding from the sole of the ski boot. Subsequent generations engage a bar recessed in the toe of the boot and incorporate a single, thick ridge along the binding plate. The variants included:
* SNS: Attaches to a U-shaped metal bar protruding from the front of the boot
* SNS Profil: Attaches to a recessed metal bar in the toe of the boot.
* SNS Pilot: Adds a recess for a second metal bar on the boot to enhance side-to-side control.
* SNS X-Adventure: Stronger design used for back-country skiing (also referred to as SNSBC).
Pilot boots can be used with Profil bindings (Equipe models and similar, with a groove for the second Pilot axle), but Profil boots cannot be used with Pilot bindings due to the wider guide ridge of the latter.

Amer Sports offered SNS under their Salomon and Atomic brands.

In 2007, Fischer abandoned SNS and switched entirely to NIS format of the NNN system.

===New Nordic Norm (NNN) ===

Rottefella&#x27;s NNN (New Nordic Norm) cross-country ski binding has a bar in the toe of the boot hooked into a corresponding latch in the binding. Bindings are offered in several configurations, classical and skating, touring and racing. Second-generation bindings are not compatible with first-generation designs. This system is the basis for movable and integrated binding plates that include the Nordic Integrated System, the Turnamic, and Prolink.

A heavy-duty, wider version, NNNBC, is designed for back-country skiing.

==== Nordic Integrated System (NIS) ====
The Nordic Integrated System (NIS), introduced in 2005 by Rossignol, Madshus, Rottefella, and Alpina, incorporates an NNN-compatible toe attachment into an integrated binding plate on the top of the ski to which the bindings attach, allowing adjustment in the field with a metallic NIS key. The initial design of the plate used a movable insert for position adjustment, using a tool. A refinement allows for movement of the position of the binding on the plate with a locking knob, while wearing the skis. NIS skis allow installation of non-NIS bindings.

==== Turnamic (IFP) ====

In 2016, Fischer and Rossignol introduced a new &quot;integrated fixation plate&quot; (IFP) binding, which allows tool-less adjustment of the NNN-compatible binding position. The Turnamic binding uses step-in locking for the boot, and the lock closes or opens by turning the lever to the side.

==== Prolink ====
With the decline in sales of its SNS systems, Salomon introduced its NNN-compatible Prolink system in 2016.

===New Telemark Norm (NTN)===

In 2007, Rottefella introduced the New Telemark Norm binding featuring lateral release, adjustability, and a freely pivoting toe attachment.

=== Ski jumping ===
Ski jumping bindings attach to the toe of square-toed plastic boots that extend above the ankles; they allow for the boot heel to rise off the skis. They are designed to release the boot, in case of a fall.

<doc id="197661" wikidata="Q1072033" url="?curid=197661" title="International Solidarity Movement">
<text>The International Solidarity Movement (ISM; ) is a Palestinian-led movement focused on assisting the Palestinian cause in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. ISM is dedicated to the use of nonviolent protests and methods only. The organization calls on civilians from around the world to participate in acts of nonviolent protests against the Israeli military in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The ISM participates in the Free Gaza Movement.

==History==
It was founded in 2001 by Ghassan Andoni, a Palestinian activist; Neta Golan, a third generation Israeli activist; Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian-American; and George N. Rishmawi, a Palestinian activist. Adam Shapiro, an American, joined the movement shortly after its founding and is also often considered one of the founders.

Osama Qashoo has also been described as a co-founder.

The group has been spied on by the British state with a Special Demonstration Squad member &#x27;Rob Harrison&#x27; infiltrating the movement from 2004 till 2007.

==Volunteer costs==
According to the ISM&#x27;s website, international volunteers who join the ISM are responsible for paying their own way and covering all their expenses in Palestine.

==Philosophy==
The organization calls on civilians from around the world to participate in acts of non-violent protests against the Israeli military in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It has been criticised for working alongside other groups to pressure Palestinian artists to boycott the One Voice Peace Summit and for helping to undermine the Summit by creating a competing event. ISM and affiliated groups critical of the Summit say that One Voice fails to fully support Palestinian rights guaranteed under international law.

===ISM&#x27;s position on violence===
The ISM&#x27;s website describes the organization as a &quot;Palestinian-led movement committed to resisting the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land using nonviolent, direct-action methods and principles&quot;. It emphasizes international volunteers are not there to &quot;teach nonviolent resistance&quot; but to support resistance through nonviolent direct action, emergency mobilization and documentation.

An article in the British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called ISM &quot;the &#x27;peace&#x27; group that embraces violence&quot; because its mission statement recognises &quot;armed struggle&quot; as the &quot;right&quot; of Palestinians. The statement in question is taken from the ISM Mission Statement:

As enshrined in international law and UN resolutions, we recognize the Palestinian right to resist Israeli violence and occupation via legitimate armed struggle. However, we believe that nonviolence can be a powerful weapon in fighting oppression and we are committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance.

ISM further explains on its website:

The ISM does not support or condone any acts of terrorism – which is not legitimate armed struggle. The ISM does not associate, support, or have anything to do with armed or violent resistance to the occupation. The ISM does not assist or engage in any kind of armed resistance, no matter what form it may take.&lt;br&gt;This right to resist occupation applies not only to the Palestinian people, but to all peoples who are faced with a military occupation. The ISM regards all people as equals with equal rights under international law. We believe that nonviolent action is a powerful weapon in fighting oppression and are committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance.

During a CNN interview, Paula Zahn with Adam Shapiro and Huwaida Arraf asked about an article they had co-authored which stated: &quot;Palestinian resistance must take on a variety of characteristics, both violent and nonviolent. But most importantly, it must develop a strategy involving both aspects. Nonviolent resistance is no less noble than carrying out a suicide operation.&quot; She noted that &quot;some people could lead to the conclusion that you were promoting suicide bombing.&quot; Shapiro and Arraf replied:
The article that we wrote was actually in response to another article written by a Palestinian, who said the Palestinians could not be nonviolent. And so we were addressing within the context of the debate over whether the Palestinians could use violence or could not use nonviolence or could use nonviolence. So it was, first of all, within that context...
There already is violence. We’re not advocating it. It&#x27;s already there. It&#x27;s on the ground. We’re working with people and with Palestinians who want to promote nonviolence, and that was the context of the whole article.

===Activism tactics===
Past ISM campaigns have used the following tactics:
* Acting to deter military operations. Some ISM volunteers object to the use of the term &quot;human shield&quot; to describe their work because, they argue, in a Palestinian context the expression more usually refers to forced use of captive Palestinians by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) when searching Palestinian neighborhoods. They argue that the IDF is far more likely to shoot the darker skinned Palestinian civilians than white western looking activists, given the difference in international response. This tactic is colloquially referred to as the &quot;white-face defense&quot;.
* Accompanying Palestinians to minimize harassment perpetuated by Israeli settlers or soldiers, for example ensuring that queues at Israeli checkpoints are processed efficiently and providing witnesses and intermediaries during annual olive harvests, which are often disrupted by settlers and police.
* Removing roadblocks. These are large unmanned mounds of earth and concrete on roads throughout the West Bank, and sometimes placed at the entrances of Palestinian villages by the IDF, thereby isolating those villages&#x27; inhabitants by preventing traffic in or out.
* Attempting to block military vehicles such as tanks and bulldozers.
* Violating Israeli curfew orders enforced on Palestinian areas in order to monitor Israeli military actions, deliver food and medicine to Palestinian homes, or escort medical personnel to help facilitate their work.
* Interfering with the construction of the West Bank barrier and placing political graffiti on the wall.
* Entering areas designated as &quot;closed military zones&quot; by the Israeli military. This is not really a &#x27;strategy&#x27; as such, but is a prerequisite for ISM being able to conduct many of the above activities as areas in which the ISM is active are often summarily designated as &quot;closed military zones&quot; by the IDF.
* Attempting to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip by supporting and participating in initiatives to send vessels through the naval blockade to Gaza.

==Noteworthy ISM events==
* The ISM received extensive media coverage of its presence in Yasser Arafat&#x27;s compound in Ramallah and at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
* On August 8, 2006, ISM activist Adam Shapiro announced that a group of ISM activists was traveling to southern Lebanon to attempt to deliver aid and show solidarity with suffering residents.
* ISM was nominated for the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize by Svend Robinson, a former New Democratic Party Member of the Parliament of Canada.
* Cofounder Ghassan Andoni was nominated for the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize along with Jeff Halper of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions by the American Friends Service Committee.

==ISM member casualties in Palestine and Israel==

===ISM member casualties timeline===

* On 2 April 2002, Australian ISM volunteer Kate Edwards sustained severe internal injuries from rounds fired by Israeli forces during a protest in Beit Jala. The incident was captured on film and appears in the documentary by Palestinian film-maker Leila Sansour, &quot;Jeremy Hardy vs the Israeli Army&quot;.
* On November 22, 2002 Caoimhe Butterly, an Irish ISM volunteer was shot and injured by IDF in Jenin minutes before UNRWA relief works project manager, Briton Iain Hook was killed nearby.
* On 16 March 2003, United States ISM volunteer Rachel Corrie was killed while trying to block an IDF armoured bulldozer. See below.
* On 5 April 2003, US ISM volunteer Brian Avery was shot in the face and permanently disfigured by machine gun fire from an IDF armoured personnel carrier while he was escorting Palestinian medical personnel in the street.
* On 11 April 2003, British ISM volunteer Thomas Hurndall was left clinically brain dead after he was shot in the head by an IDF soldier. Initially the soldier claimed the shooting occurred during an armed firefight between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants but the prosecuted soldier later admitted firing at him &quot;as a deterrent&quot;. Hurndall died on 13 January 2004.

====Killings====
=====Rachel Corrie=====
ISM volunteer Rachel Corrie was killed as she attempted to block an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bulldozer conducting military operations in Rafah in the Gaza Strip on March 16, 2003. An internal IDF investigation concluded that Corrie&#x27;s death was an accident but ISM eyewitnesses dispute this account, contending that the bulldozer driver deliberately struck Corrie as she was protesting in plain view. The IDF says that tapes of the event show Corrie below the driver&#x27;s eye level, and also say that the noise level was too loud for Ms. Corrie to be heard. The activities of the bulldozer she was blocking are also subject to disagreement — ISM claim it was preparing to demolish the home of a Palestinian pharmacist. Other accounts backed by the film footage claim that the bulldozer was not near the house but was removing shrubbery covering a structure that could be used as an arms smuggling tunnel or to cover terrorists shooting at the IDF.

George Rishmawi of the ISM told the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; that: &quot;When Palestinians get shot by Israeli soldiers, no one is interested anymore. But if some of these foreign volunteers get shot or even killed, then the international media will sit up and take notice.&quot;

Corrie&#x27;s parents brought lawsuits in the United States and in Israel, but in both cases, they lost the suit. In Israel, in August 2012, the court said that Corrie could have avoided danger. The court ruled that Israel was not at fault for Corrie&#x27;s death, and there was neither intent nor negligence involved in her death. The judge also said that Israel&#x27;s investigation was appropriate and did not contain mistakes. The judge also criticized the U.S. for failing to send a diplomatic representative to observe Corrie&#x27;s autopsy.

=====Tom Hurndall=====

On April 11, 2003 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Sergeant Taysir Hayb shot International Solidarity Movement (ISM) volunteer Tom Hurndall in the head. Hurndall, who had been aiding Palestinians in Gaza, died of his wound in January 2004. Hurndall was unarmed, dressed in the bright orange jacket of the ISM, and steering two Palestinian children away from an Israeli tank-mounted machine gun shooting in their direction.

Hayb claimed he had shot at a man in military fatigues who was firing at the soldiers with a pistol, in the no-go security zone. This was at odds with the ISM&#x27;s account, confirmed by photographic evidence.

Subsequently, Hayb admitted to fabricating his account of events. On 10 May 2004, Hayb&#x27;s trial commenced on one charge of manslaughter in the death of Tom Hurndall, two counts of obstruction of justice, one count each of submitting false testimony, obtaining false testimony, and unbecoming behavior. Hurndall&#x27;s family pressed for a murder charge through the Israeli courts. In August 2005, Taysir Hayb was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a total of eight years imprisonment, seven years for the manslaughter of Hurndall and one year for obstruction of justice.

===== Aysenur Eygi =====
On 6 September 2024, Aysenur Ezgi Eygi a 26-year-old American-Turkish woman was attending a weekly protest held near the Israeli settlement of Evyatar, and allegedly shot and killed by IDF snipers. The protest was against the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and had attracted violence prior to the incident. Witnesses reported that IDF forces had confronted the activists and shot at them with tear gas and live ammunition to force them to disperse. About thirty minutes after the confrontation, protestors reported that two IDF snipers on a roof about 200 yards away opened fire, killing Eygi and wounding a Palestinian teenager in the leg.

====Injuries====
=====Kate Edwards=====
Australian ISM volunteer Kate Edwards sustained internal injuries from a bullet in Beit Jala. She and other volunteers marched on Israeli lines. After the event, Kate Edwards was quoted as stating &quot;We were walking up the hill from Bethlehem when a tank came down the hill towards us. I could see a man in the tank and he was shouting at us to go back. We carried on going.&quot;

=====Caoimhe Butterly=====

Irish ISM volunteer and human rights activist Caoimhe Butterly was shot in the thigh by an Israeli soldier during the Battle of Jenin.

=====Brian Avery=====

On April 5, 2003, Israeli Defense Force soldiers on a military convoy shot Brian Avery (born 1979) in the face, seriously disfiguring him, while he was volunteering for the ISM in the West Bank city of Jenin. He was wearing red reflector vests with the word &quot;doctor&quot; in English and Arabic. The IDF refused to order an investigation, saying there was no proof its soldiers had shot at anyone that day. Avery sued and in November 2008 accepted a $150,000 settlement from the Israeli government in exchange for dropping the lawsuit.

=====Tristan Anderson=====
On March 13, 2009, American ISM volunteer Tristan Anderson was critically injured after being hit in the head by a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops attempting to disperse a demonstration. Anderson was taken to a hospital in Israel, where he underwent brain surgery, and had to have a portion of his frontal lobe and fragments of shattered bone removed. ISM volunteer and Tristan&#x27;s girlfriend Gabrielle Silverman (Israeli-American), who witnessed to his injury:
&quot;We were at a demonstration against the wall, against the Israeli apartheid wall in the West Bank village of Ni&#x27;lin, which is about twenty-six kilometers west of Ramallah. I was very close to him when he was shot. I was only a few feet away. The demonstration had been going for several hours. It was wrapping up; it was almost over. Most people had already gone home. We were standing on some grass nearby a village mosque, and Tristan was taking pictures [when] he was shot in the head with the extended range tear gas canister.&quot;
=====Bianca Zammit=====
On April 24, 2010, Bianca Zammit, a 28 year old activist from Malta, was shot in the thigh with live ammunition by IDF soldiers during a demonstration in the so-called &quot;buffer zone&quot; inside Gaza Strip. Two Palestinian demonstrators were also shot during the same demonstration in Al Maghazi Refugee Camp.

=====April 2012=====
On April 14, a group of at least 200 pro-Palestinian activists were travelling on bicycles, and several buses in a silent protest. They were stopped by Israeli soldiers before entering onto Highway 90, and asked not to continue for their own safety. The legality of the protesters action is unclear as some news agencies state the cyclists got permission to protest but others state no permit was given. During the ensuing hour, the activists refused and blocked an entrance to a highway, a &quot;scuffle&quot; broke out. In an interview given by one of the members he stated &quot;בשלב מסויים החלטנו לאתגר את החיילים ולנסות להמשיך בנסיעה&quot; (&quot;... at some point we decided to test the soldiers and continue to move&quot;) and after a few moments they had been assaulted. In an interview for JPost &quot;After about half-an-hour, he said, the cyclists decided to push past the IDF, and that is when the violence began.&quot; Four activists sustained face and back injuries and had to be evacuated to a hospital in Jericho, West Bank. The next day, ISM posted a video showing an IDF officer hitting a Danish protester in the face with his assault rifle. The IDF officer said that he was attacked by one of the activists in the incident with a stick, breaking two fingers. The IDF said it was a &quot;grave incident&quot; and was suspending the officer and investigating the incident. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Shimon Peres, and IDF Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Benny Gantz all condemned the incident. NGO Monitor said that ISM &quot;has a long record of encouraging activists to take &#x27;direct action&#x27; that often places them in danger and in direct confrontations with the IDF.&quot;

=====Fred Ekblad=====
On July 25, 2014, Swedish activist Fred Ekblad had a moderate injury in his head from an Israeli tank shelling Beit Hanoun hospital in the Gaza Strip.

===ISM casualties by Palestinian militants===
====Deaths====
=====Akram Ibrahim Abu Sba&#x27;=====
On September 6, 2007, ISM Jenin regional committee member and &quot;co-founder of one of ISM&#x27;s first permanent presences&quot; Akram Ibrahim Abu Sba’ was killed on duty by Islamic Jihad militants, while trying to &quot;smooth tensions between Palestinian security forces and Islamic Jihad members&quot;, in the Palestinian city of Jenin. Akram was buried in the Jenin refugee camp graveyard.

=====Vittorio Arrigoni=====
On April 14, 2011, Italian ISM activist Vittorio Arrigoni was abducted, tortured and executed by hanging by a Salafist group in the Gaza Strip.

==ISM member casualties in Syria==
===Kayla Mueller===
Mueller was a native of Prescott, Arizona, where she graduated from Tri-city College Prep High School. She attended Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in 2007. She volunteered for three years with the Save Darfur Coalition. Her human rights activism included working in India and with Tibetan refugees. Her work in the Middle East included working for Palestinian rights with the International Solidarity Movement and helping African refugees in Israel with the African Refugee Development Center.

Mueller started working in southern Turkey in December 2012, where she was assisting Syrian refugees. On August 3, 2013, she drove to the northern Syrian city of Aleppo with a coworker/friend who was traveling to the Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo to work for a day. She worked with international aid agency Support to Life. On her departure from Aleppo to return to Turkey, militants abducted her.

According to anonymous sources of Catherine Herridge, the location of Mueller and other US hostages was known by the White House in May 2014, but a decision on a rescue mission was not made for seven weeks. By that time, the hostages had been dispersed.

A media account affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) released a statement on February 6, 2015, claiming that a female American hostage held by the group was killed by one of around a dozen Jordanian airstrikes in Raqqa, Syria. The statement came just days after the release of a video showing the murder of Jordanian fighter pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh by the militant group and the subsequent execution of Sajida al-Rishawi and other prisoners of Jordan. The statement was later translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, identifying the hostage as Mueller.

On February 6, 2015, ISIL published a photo of a damaged building, named Mueller and her home town and alleged she had been killed in a Jordanian airstrike in the building where she was left alone with no guards, but no proof of death was provided. The Pentagon agreed the building was one hit in the bombings, but disputed that Mueller, or any civilian, was inside. The site had been bombed by the coalition twice before, and was targeted again because ISIS soldiers sometimes return to bombed sites, thinking the coalition won&#x27;t return, according to Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. After this, Mueller&#x27;s name was released by American and other media with the family&#x27;s consent.

On February 10, 2015, Mueller&#x27;s family announced ISIS had confirmed her death to them in an e-mail, with three photographs of her dead body, bruised on the face and wearing a black hijab. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said this message was authenticated by the intelligence community. President Barack Obama offered his condolences to Mueller&#x27;s family.

On October 26–27, 2019, U.S. Joint Special Operations Command members found the hideout of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Idlib Governorate, northern Syria, before he died from suicide vest blast. The operation was named Operation Kayla Mueller by President Donald J. Trump.

==Criticism and controversies==

===Position of Israeli Foreign Ministry===
The Israeli Foreign Ministry reported that two terrorists involved in the Mike&#x27;s Place suicide bombing forged &quot;links with foreign left wing activists and members of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM).&quot; The MFA also says that &quot;ISM members take an active part in illegal and violent actions against IDF soldiers. At times, their activity in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip is under the auspices of Palestinian terrorist organizations, and that sometimes, &quot;ISM members, who seek entry into Israel, often do so under false pretenses, via cover stories – entry for matrimonial, tourist, religious and other purposes – which they coordinate prior to arriving in Israel.&quot; However, ISM reports that visitors at the border who identify as ISM volunteers, almost always will be denied entry by the Israeli border control.

===Shadi Sukiya case===
On March 27, 2003, Palestinian Shadi Sukiya was arrested in by the Israel Defense Forces in ISM Jenin. The Israeli government claimed that Sukiya was a senior Islamic Jihad member, and that he was aided by two ISM activists.

Both parties stated that Sukiya arrived at the ISM&#x27;s office as he was being pursued through the streets of Jenin by IDF soldiers during an Israeli-imposed curfew. According to the ISM&#x27;s account, he had been going door to door looking for a place to go, arrived at the building (which is also used by the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres) cold and wet, and was offered a chance to dry and warm up by an ISM volunteer.

The IDF originally suggested that two Kalashnikov assault rifles and a handgun were found on the premises, but subsequently backtracked on the allegation.

In May 2003, Adam Shapiro from ISM stated that Sukiya was not named a &quot;senior Islamic Jihad terrorist&quot; by any official Israeli military or government source, and was being held in administrative detention in Israel without any charge.

===Ties with Palestinian militants===

The Israeli government asserted ISM activist Susan Barclay had &quot;ties with Palestinian terrorist groups&quot;. She stated she worked with representatives of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in organising a nonviolent protest.

According to Israeli sources ISM activist maintain ties with &quot;Palestinian terrorists&quot;, aiding them, disrupting IDF activities and in some instance even attacked IDF soldiers.
: &quot;Israel says that the connection between ISM activists to Palestinian terrorists is not merely sleeping in terrorists&#x27; houses. According to Israel Security Service (Shin-Bet), some of the activists maintain connections with terrorists, and act to disrupt IDF operations in the territories. In one case ISM activists exposed an ambush set by the IDF after lighting on it with flashlights. In July, two ISM activists attacked soldiers in Beit-Pourik checkpoint. IDF officer tells that in several cases ISM activists opened routes to Palestinians by going first to check if there is a military checkpoint in the way.&quot;

Richard David Hupper, an ISM activist, was convicted in a USA court of illegally funding Hamas while working with the ISM. Hupper donated money which he intended to be used to aid the families of Palestinians who had been detained or killed.

===Israeli court ruling===
In 2012, Israeli judge Oded Gershon ruled about the ISM that &quot;In fact, the organization abuses human rights and morals discourse to blur the severity of its actions which manifested de facto as violence.&quot; He also ruled that ISM activists provided financial, logistic and moral aid to terrorists.

<text>Ferdinand Lassalle (11 April 1825 – 31 August 1864) was a German socialist activist and politician who founded the first German workers&#x27; party, the General German Workers&#x27; Association (ADAV), in 1863. He is best remembered as the initiator of the country&#x27;s social-democratic movement, which after his death led to the formation of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1875.

Lassalle studied philosophy at the Universities of Breslau and Berlin, and was involved as an agitator in the German Revolutions of 1848. Lassalle&#x27;s socialism viewed the state as the expression of the people, not as a construct of social class, and he argued that industry should be placed in the hands of the workers by the existing government, pressured by the labor movement. This was a form of state socialism opposed to the revolutionary socialism of Karl Marx, one of his greatest rivals. Lassalle based his politics on his &quot;iron law of wages&quot;, which posited that wages could never rise above the subsistence level in the capitalist system. He died in a duel related to a love affair in 1864; ADAV remained the largest German socialist party until 1875.
== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Lassalle was born Ferdinand Johann Gottlieb Lassal on 11 April 1825 in Breslau, Silesia (now Wrocław, Poland). His father Heyman Lassal was a Jewish silk merchant and intended his son for a business career, sending him to the commercial school at Leipzig. However, Lassalle soon transferred to university, studying first at the University of Breslau and later at the University of Berlin. There, Lassalle studied philology and philosophy and became a devotee of the philosophical system of Georg Hegel. Lassalle changed his name at a young age to disassociate himself from Judaism.

Lassalle passed his university examinations with distinction in 1845 and thereafter traveled to Paris to write a book on Heraclitus. There, Lassalle met the poet Heinrich Heine, who wrote of his intense young friend in 1846: &quot;I have found in no one so much passion and clearness of intellect united in action. You have good right to be audacious – we others only usurp this divine right, this heavenly privilege&quot;.

Back in Berlin to work on his book, Lassalle met Countess Sophie von Hatzfeldt, a woman in her early 40s who had been separated from her husband of many years and who had an ongoing dispute with him regarding the disposition of the couple&#x27;s property. Lassalle volunteered himself to her cause and the offer was readily accepted. Lassalle first challenged her husband to a duel, but his challenge was rejected.

An eight-year legal battle followed in which Lassalle defended Countess von Hatzfeldt&#x27;s interests in 36 different courtrooms. Ultimately, a settlement was made in her favor, bringing her a substantial fortune. In her gratitude, she agreed to pay Lassalle an annual income of 5,000 thalers (about £750) for the rest of his life.

=== 1848 Revolution and its aftermath ===
Lassalle was a committed socialist from an early age. During the German Revolutions of 1848, he spoke at public meetings in favor of the revolutionary-democratic cause and urged the citizens of Düsseldorf to prepare themselves for armed resistance in advance of the violence that was expected after the decision of the Prussian government to dissolve the National Assembly. Lassalle was subsequently arrested for his involvement in this activity and he was charged with inciting armed opposition to the state.

Although Lassalle was acquitted of this serious charge, he was kept in prison until he could be tried on a lesser charge of inciting resistance against public officials. He was convicted of this lesser charge and the 23-year-old Lassalle served a sentence of six months in prison.

Banned from residence in Berlin in the aftermath of his conviction, Lassalle moved to the Rhineland, where he continued to pursue the lawsuit of the Countess von Hatzfeldt (settled in 1854) and finished his work on the philosophy of Heraclitus, (completed in 1857 and published in two volumes the following year). Reaction to the book was mixed as some declared the work seminal while others, including Karl Marx, considered it a mere recitation of Hegelian axioms. However, even the book&#x27;s detractors had to admire the scope of the work and the publication gave Lassalle lasting status among German intellectuals.

During this period, Lassalle was not politically active, although he remained interested in labor affairs. He left his legal practice and philosophy in favor of drama, authoring a play called &quot;Franz von Sickingen, a Historical Tragedy&quot;. Sent anonymously to the Royal Theatre, the play was rejected by a manager, causing Lassalle to publish it under his own name in 1859. The work was characterized by Eduard Bernstein, an early and sympathetic biographer, as awkward and prone to excessive oratory, unsuited for the stage despite several effective scenes.

Lassalle wanted to live in Berlin and despite the ban in 1859 made his return disguised as a wagon driver. Lassalle appealed to his friend, the aging scholar Alexander von Humboldt, to intercede on his behalf before the king to rescind the ban and allow his return. The appeal was successful and Lassalle was again officially allowed to live in the Prussian capital.

Lassalle avoided revolutionary activity for several years thereafter. He became a political commentator and wrote a short book on the war in Italy in which he warned Prussia against rushing to the aid of the Austrian Empire in its war with France. Lassalle followed this with a larger work on legal theory, published in two volumes in 1861 as &quot;Das System der erworbenen Rechte&quot; (&quot;The System of Acquired Rights&quot;). According to Bernstein, Lassalle wanted the book &quot;to establish a legal and scientific principle which shall once for all determine under what circumstances, and how far laws may be retroactive without violating the idea of right itself&quot;; that is, determining the circumstances under which laws may be made retroactive when they come into conflict with previously established laws.

=== Political activism ===

Only briefly engaged in the revolutionary struggle during 1848, Lassalle reentered public politics in 1862, motivated by a constitutional struggle in Prussia. King Wilhelm I, who became king on 2 January 1861, had repeatedly clashed with the liberal Chamber of Deputies, resulting in multiple dissolutions of the Diet. As a recognized legal scholar, Lassalle was asked to make public addresses dealing with the nature of the constitution and its relationship to the social forces within society.

Lassalle replied by giving a speech wherein he set out that constitutional matters are merely questions of power. The liberal press was enraged by his speech. Lassalle reacted by holding the same lecture two more times.

In another speech, delivered in Berlin on 12 April 1862, later known as the &quot;Workers&#x27; Program,&quot; Lassalle assigned moral primacy in society to the working class over the bourgeosie, an assertion regarded as dangerous by the Prussian censorship. The entire print run of 3,000 copies of the pamphlet of Lassalle&#x27;s speech was seized by the authorities, who issued a legal charge against Lassalle for allegedly endangering the public peace.

Lassalle was brought to trial to answer this accusation in Berlin on 16 January 1863. Lawsuits would continue to interfere with his political activity for the rest of his life. After a widely publicized trial at which he presented his own defense, Lassalle was convicted of the charges levied against him, sentenced to four months&#x27; imprisonment and assessed the costs of the trial. This term was later replaced by a fine upon appeal.

=== Foundation of the socialist party ===
On 22 October 1862, a few worker delegates who had visited London had come back with left-wing ideas, and published an open letter about the political and economic situation of the working class. Lassalle was delighted to find workers whose ideas went even further than the socialist statements which he had made in public, and replied with his own open letter in which he called for a workers&#x27; party, independent of the liberal German Progress Party.

By arguing that the working class had nothing to gain from the liberal party, he in effect had declared of war with the liberal party and newspapers for the next months until his death. Lassalle soon began a new career as a political agitator, traveling around Germany, giving speeches and writing pamphlets in an attempt to organise and rouse the working class. As he tried to make the working class break with the liberals, this would eventually lead to an alliance with the reactionary Prince Bismarck.

In 1864, Lassalle made several secret appeals to Bismarck, later the main proponent of the Anti-Socialist Laws, in favor of the immediate implementation of progressive policies such as universal suffrage. He also asked for the protection of his own publications from police seizure. Lassalle attempted to make common cause with the conservative Bismarck in his book &quot;Herr Basitat-Schulze,&quot; declaring that he &quot;must inform Your Excellency that this work will bring about the utter destruction of Liberals and the whole Progressive bourgeoisie.&quot; Lassalle asked Bismarck to exert his influence at the Ministry of Justice to prevent the seizure of the book. The book subsequently appeared without police interference, but Bismarck, occupied with other matters, refused a request by Lassalle for another meeting and no further direct contacts between the pair were made.

Élie Halévy would later write on this situation:

The only stated purpose of the party was the winning of equal, universal and direct suffrage by peaceful and legal means.

=== Personality ===
Lassalle was remembered by biographers as a contradictory personality, earnestly committed to benefit the masses, but driven by personal ambition and possessing extreme vanity. Indeed, one early biographer declared:

Bertrand Russell said about Lassalle: &quot;No one has ever understood the power of agitation and organisation better than Lassalle … The secret of his influence lay in his overpowering and imperious will, in his impatience of the passive endurance of evil, and in his absolute confidence in his own power. His whole character is that of an epicurean god, unwittingly become man, awakening suddenly to the existence of evil, and finding with amazement that his will is not omnipotent to set it right.&quot;

Lassalle suffered from bouts of ill health throughout his adult life. He contracted gout, experienced &quot;nervous exhaustion,&quot; and complained of another ailment that doctors were unable to diagnose. It has been suggested that Lassalle suffered from syphilis. He became very ill in July 1860 and visited a sanatorium in Aachen. In 1864, he went to the resort of Rigi Kaltbad in Switzerland for treatment.

=== Death and legacy ===

In Rigi Kaltbad, Lassalle met a young woman named Helene von Dönniges and during the summer of 1864 they decided to marry. She was the daughter of a Protestant family then living in Geneva, who wanted nothing to do with Lassalle. The father, a historian, prevented Helene from seeing him and Lassalle protested vehemently. Apparently under duress, she soon renounced Lassalle in favour of another suitor, a Wallachian prince named Iancu Racoviță, to whom she had previously been betrothed.

Lassalle sent dueling challenges both to Helene&#x27;s father von Dönniges and to Racoviță, who accepted. Lassalle had no experience in the use of pistols and only one day to exercise. At the Carouge, a suburb of Geneva, a duel was held on the morning of 28 August. Lassalle was shot in the abdomen by Racoviță and died three days later on 31 August 1864. Following the duel Racoviţă fell ill and died not long after Helene von Dönniges married him.

At the time of his death, Lassalle&#x27;s political party had 4,610 members and no detailed political program. The ADAV continued after his death, going on to help establish the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1875. &quot;Lassalle was the first man in Germany, the first in Europe, who succeeded in organising a party of socialist action,&quot; according to Élie Halévy. Or, as Rosa Luxemburg put it: &quot;what Lassalle managed to wrestle from history in two years of flaming agitation needed many decades to come about.&quot;

Ferdinand Lassalle is buried in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), in the Old Jewish Cemetery.

== Political relations ==

=== Relations with Marx ===
Lassalle and Marx became friends during the Revolutions of 1848. When the protests were crushed, Lassalle was imprisoned and Marx fled Germany. They continued correspondence through letters, and would not meet again until 1861. In the meantime Marx grew to distrust Lassalle under influence of Engels, who had never much sympathy for him. Marx often responded to Lassalle&#x27;s warm letters by mirroring this tone, but in his letters to Engels he expressed antipathy towards Lassalle, including calling him &quot;the Jewish nigger Lassalle&quot;. Lassalle continued to believe that their friendship was genuine until at least 1862. Franz Mehring called Marx&#x27;s &quot;attitude to Lassalle [...] the most difficult psychological problem his life offers&quot;.

The difference in character between the two men presented itself in a clear manner when they had to defend themselves for their support of 1848 revolutions, in front of a jury:Also on theoretical and political matters, their opinions diverged. Indeed, Marx&#x27;s essay &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot; is written in part as a reaction to Lassalle&#x27;s ideas within the socialist party of Germany. Lassalle was a German patriot, and supported Prussia in its quest for German unification. In February 1864, Lassalle wrote to Engels that despite being a republican since infancy, &quot;I have come to the conviction that nothing could have a greater future or a more beneficent role than the monarchy, if it could only make up its mind to become a social monarchy. In that case I would passionately bear its banner, and the constitutional theories would be quickly enough thrown into the lumber room.&quot;

=== Relations with Bismarck ===

On 11 May 1863, Otto von Bismarck, Minister President of Prussia, wrote a letter to Lassalle. This letter was delivered and the two met face to face within 48 hours. This was the first of several such meetings, during which Bismarck and Lassalle freely exchanged views on matters of common concern. This Bismarck-Lassalle correspondence was not made public until 1927 and was therefore not mentioned by earlier biographers.

In September 1878, Bismarck was pressed by Social Democratic representative August Bebel in the Reichstag to provide details about his past relationship with Lassalle, prompting the Chancellor to make the following statement:

Eduard Bernstein noted that it is highly unlikely that Bismarck was telling the truth about their relation.

== Political ideas ==
Owing to his premature death by a duel at age 39, just two years after his serious entry into German radical politics, Lassalle&#x27;s actual contributions to socialist theory are modest. He was remembered by Richard T. Ely, one of the earliest serious scholars of international socialism, as a popularizer of the ideas of others rather than an innovator:

=== State ===
In contrast with Marx and his adherents, Lassalle rejected the idea that the state was a class-based power structure with the function of preserving existing class relations and destined to wither away in a future classless society. Instead, Lassalle considered the state as an independent entity, an instrument of justice essential for the achievement of the socialist program.

=== Iron law of wages ===
Lassalle accepted the idea first posited by the classical economist David Ricardo that wage rates in the long term tended towards the minimum level necessary to sustain the life of the worker and to provide for his reproduction. In accord with the law of rent, Lassalle coined his own iron law of wages. Lassalle argued that individual measures of self-help by wage workers were destined to failure and that only producers&#x27; cooperatives established with the financial aid of the state would make economic improvement of the workers&#x27; lives possible. From this, it followed that the political action of the workers to capture the power of the state was paramount and the organization of trade unions to struggle for ephemeral wage improvements is more or less a diversion from the primary struggle.

=== Philosophy ===
Lassalle considered Johann Gottlieb Fichte as &quot;one of the mightiest thinkers of all peoples and ages,&quot; praising Fichte&#x27;s &quot;Addresses to the German Nation&quot; in a May 1862 speech as &quot;one of the mightiest monuments of fame which our people possesses, and which, in depth and power, far surpass everything of this sort which has been handed down to us from the literature of all time and peoples.&quot;

=== Homosexuality ===
Lassalle defended a homosexual member of his party, Johann Baptista von Schweitzer, who was attacked merely because of his sexual orientation. Marx and Engels wrote about Schweitzer in a pejorative manner and made jokes about his homosexuality, and members of the ADAV refused to let him speak. Lassalle on the other hand defended Schweitzer against such attacks:

Lassalle also responded by walking with Schweitzer, arm in arm, through Frankfurt. He reminded his contemporaries that in Ancient Greece homosexuality was socially acceptable: &quot;However incomprehensible such unnatural tastes appear to us, the tendency of which Dr. von Schweitzer is accused was the general rule among the ancient Greeks, their statesmen and their philosophers. Ancient Greece saw nothing wrong in it, and I consider the great Greek philosophers and the Greek people knew the meaning of morality.&quot;

<doc id="197667" wikidata="Q1891935" url="?curid=197667" title="Tongue and groove">
<text>Tongue and groove is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with wood, in flooring, parquetry, panelling, and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before plywood became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for sheathing buildings and to construct concrete formwork.

A strong joint, the tongue and groove joint is widely used for re-entrant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded. In expensive cabinet work, glued dovetail and multiple tongue and groove are used.

Each piece has a slot (the &quot;groove&quot; or &quot;dado&quot;) cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the &quot;tongue&quot;) on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The joint is not normally glued, as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.

In another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for mitre joints, face nailing, and the use of joints on or centres of conventional framing.

For many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later composite wood boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality boards. Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in platform framing is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.

When joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.

&quot;Tongue and groove&quot; is sometimes abbreviated as T&amp;G (for example, on price tags and shelf tags).

==Methods==
One of the following woodworking tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:

* A wood shaper (spindle moulder) – a four- or six-head moulder for large quantities
* A circular saw bench
* Suitable hand planes: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane
* A spindle router

==Tongue-in-groove==
Tongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.

In old sailor slang vernacular, a &quot;tonguin&quot; (pronounced ) can refer to repairs made to a boat of tongue and groove construction.

A &quot;tonguin&quot; can also refer to a small raft made from tongue and groove construction methods.

<doc id="197673" wikidata="Q1778158" url="?curid=197673" title="Delay-line memory">
<text>Delay-line memory is a form of computer memory, mostly obsolete, that was used on some of the earliest digital computers, and is reappearing in the form of optical delay lines. Like many modern forms of electronic computer memory, delay-line memory was a refreshable memory, but as opposed to modern random-access memory, delay-line memory was sequential-access.

Analog delay line technology had been used since the 1920s to delay the propagation of analog signals. When a delay line is used as a memory device, an amplifier and a pulse shaper are connected between the output of the delay line and the input. These devices recirculate the signals from the output back into the input, creating a loop that maintains the signal as long as power is applied. The shaper ensures the pulses remain well-formed, removing any degradation due to losses in the medium.

The memory capacity equals the time to transmit one bit divided by the recirculation time. Early delay-line memory systems had capacities of a few thousand bits (although the term &quot;bit&quot; was not in popular use at the time), with recirculation times measured in microseconds. To read or write a particular memory address, it is necessary to wait for the signal representing its value to circulate through the delay line into the electronics. The latency to read or write any particular address is thus time and address dependent, but no longer than the recirculation time.

Use of a delay line for a computer memory was invented by J. Presper Eckert in the mid-1940s for use in computers such as the EDVAC and the UNIVAC I. Eckert and John Mauchly applied for a patent for a delay-line memory system on October 31, 1947; the patent was issued in 1953. This patent focused on mercury delay lines, but it also discussed delay lines made of strings of inductors and capacitors, magnetostrictive delay lines, and delay lines built using rotating disks to transfer data to a read head at one point on the circumference from a write head elsewhere around the circumference.

==Genesis in radar==
The basic concept of the delay line originated with World War II radar research, as a system to reduce clutter from reflections from the ground and other non-moving objects.

A radar system consists principally of an antenna, a transmitter, a receiver, and a display. The antenna is connected to the transmitter, which sends out a brief pulse of radio energy before being disconnected again. The antenna is then connected to the receiver, which amplifies any reflected signals and sends them to the display. Objects farther from the radar return echos later than those closer to the radar, which the display indicates visually as a &quot;blip&quot;, which can be measured against a scale in order to determine range.

Non-moving objects at a fixed distance from the antenna always return a signal after the same delay. This would appear as a fixed spot on the display, making detection of other targets in the area more difficult. Early radars simply aimed their beams away from the ground to avoid the majority of this &quot;clutter&quot;. This was not an ideal situation; it required careful aiming, which was difficult for smaller mobile radars, and did not remove other sources of clutter-like reflections from features like prominent hills, and in the worst case would allow low-flying enemy aircraft to literally fly &quot;under the radar&quot;.

To filter out static objects, two pulses were compared, and returns with the same delay times were removed. To do this, the signal sent from the receiver to the display was split in two, with one path leading directly to the display and the second leading to a delay unit. The delay was carefully tuned to be some multiple of the time between pulses, or &quot;pulse repetition frequency&quot;. This resulted in the delayed signal from an earlier pulse exiting the delay unit the same time that the signal from a newer pulse was received from the antenna. One of the signals was electrically inverted, typically the one from the delay, and the two signals were then combined and sent to the display. Any signal that was at the same location was nullified by the inverted signal from a previous pulse, leaving only the moving objects on the display.

Several different types of delay systems were invented for this purpose, with one common principle being that the information was stored acoustically in a medium. MIT experimented with a number of systems, including glass, quartz, steel and lead. The Japanese deployed a system consisting of a quartz element with a powdered glass coating that reduced surface waves that interfered with proper reception. The United States Naval Research Laboratory used steel rods wrapped into a helix, but this was useful only for low frequencies under 1 MHz. Raytheon used a magnesium alloy originally developed for making bells.

The first practical de-cluttering system based on the concept was developed by J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Moore School of Electrical Engineering. His solution used a column of mercury with piezo crystal transducers (a combination of speaker and microphone) at either end. Signals from the radar amplifier were sent to the transducer at one end of the tube, which would generate a small wave in the mercury. The wave would quickly travel to the far end of the tube, where it would be read back out by the other transducer, inverted, and sent to the display. Careful mechanical arrangement was needed to ensure that the delay time matched the inter-pulse timing of the radar being used.

All of these systems were suitable for conversion into a computer memory. The key was to restore and recycle the signals, so they would not disappear after traveling through the delay. This was relatively easy to arrange with simple electronics.

== Acoustic delay lines ==

===Mercury delay lines===

After the war, Eckert turned his attention to computer development, which was a topic of some interest at the time. One problem with practical development was the lack of a suitable memory device, and Eckert&#x27;s work on the radar delays gave him a major advantage over other researchers in this regard.

For a computer application the timing was still critical, but for a different reason. Conventional computers have a clock period needed to complete an operation, which typically start and end with reading or writing memory. Thus the delay lines had to be timed such that the pulses would arrive at the receiver just as the computer was ready to read it. Many pulses would be in-flight through the delay, and the computer would count the pulses by comparing to a master clock to find the particular bit it was looking for.
Mercury was used because its acoustic impedance is close to that of the piezoelectric quartz crystals; this minimized the energy loss and the echoes when the signal was transmitted from crystal to medium and back again. The high speed of sound in mercury (1450 m/s) meant that the time needed to wait for a pulse to arrive at the receiving end was less than it would have been with a slower medium, such as air (343.2 m/s), but it also meant that the total number of pulses that could be stored in any reasonably sized column of mercury was limited. Other technical drawbacks of mercury included its weight, its cost, and its toxicity. Moreover, to get the acoustic impedances to match as closely as possible, the mercury had to be kept at a constant temperature. The system heated the mercury to a uniform above-room temperature setting of 40 °C (104 °F), which made servicing the tubes hot and uncomfortable work. (Alan Turing proposed the use of gin as an ultrasonic delay medium, claiming that it had the necessary acoustic properties.)

A considerable amount of engineering was needed to maintain a clean signal inside the tube. Large transducers were used to generate a very tight beam of sound that would not touch the walls of the tube, and care had to be taken to eliminate reflections from the far end of the tubes. The tightness of the beam then required considerable tuning to make sure that both transducers were pointed directly at each other. Since the speed of sound changes with temperature, the tubes were heated in large ovens to keep them at a precise temperature. Other systems instead adjusted the computer clock rate according to the ambient temperature to achieve the same effect.

EDSAC, the second full-scale stored-program digital computer, began operation with 256 35-bit words of memory, stored in 16 delay lines holding 560 bits each (words in the delay line were composed from 36 pulses, one pulse was used as a space between consecutive numbers). The memory was later expanded to 512 words by adding a second set of 16 delay lines. In the UNIVAC I the capacity of an individual delay line was smaller, each column stored 120 bits, requiring seven large memory units with 18 columns each to make up a 1000-word store. Combined with their support circuitry and amplifiers, the memory subsystem formed its own walk-in room. The average access time was about 222 microseconds, which was considerably faster than the mechanical systems used on earlier computers.

CSIRAC, completed in November 1949, also used delay-line memory.

Some mercury delay-line memory devices produced audible sounds, which were described as akin to a human voice mumbling. This property gave rise to the slang term &quot;mumble-tub&quot; for these devices.

===Magnetostrictive delay lines===
A later version of the delay line used steel wires as the storage medium. Transducers were built by applying the magnetostrictive effect; small pieces of a magnetostrictive material, typically nickel, were attached to either side of the end of the wire, inside an electromagnet. When bits from the computer entered the magnets, the nickel would contract or expand (based on the polarity) and twist the end of the wire. The resulting torsional wave would then move down the wire just as the sound wave did down the mercury column.

Unlike the compressive wave used in earlier devices, torsional waves are considerably more resistant to problems caused by mechanical imperfections, so much that the wires could be wound into a loose coil and pinned to a board. Due to their ability to be coiled, the wire-based systems could be as long as needed, so tended to hold considerably more data per unit; 1 kbit units were typical on a board only 1 square foot (). Of course, this also meant that the time needed to find a particular bit was somewhat longer as it travelled through the wire, and access times on the order of 500 microseconds were typical.

Delay-line memory was far less expensive and far more reliable per bit than flip-flops made from tubes, and yet far faster than a latching relay. It was used into the late 1960s, notably on commercial machines like the LEO I, Highgate Wood Telephone Exchange, various Ferranti machines, and the IBM 2848 Display Control. Delay-line memory was also used for video memory in early terminals, where one delay line would typically store 4 lines of characters (4 lines × 40 characters per line × 6 bits per character = 960 bits in one delay line). They were also used very successfully in several models of early desktop electronic calculator, including the Friden EC-130 (1964) and EC-132, the Olivetti Programma 101 desktop programmable calculator introduced in 1965, and the Litton Monroe Epic 2000 and 3000 programmable calculators of 1967.

===Piezoelectric delay lines===

A similar solution to the magnetostrictive system was to use delay lines made entirely of a piezoelectric material, typically quartz. Current fed into one end of the crystal would generate a compressive wave that would flow to the other end, where it could be read. In effect, piezoelectric material simply replaced the mercury and transducers of a conventional mercury delay line with a single unit combining both. However, these solutions were fairly rare; growing crystals of the required quality in large sizes was not easy, which limited them to small sizes and thus small amounts of data storage.

A better and more widespread use of piezoelectric delay lines was in European television sets. The European PAL standard for color broadcasts compares the signal from two successive lines of the image in order to avoid color shifting due to small phase shifts. By comparing two lines, one of which is inverted, the shifting is averaged, and the resulting signal more closely matches the original signal, even in the presence of interference. In order to compare the two lines, a piezoelectric delay unit to delay the signal by a time that is equal to the duration of each line, 64 μs, is inserted in one of the two signal paths that are compared. In order to produce the required delay in a crystal of convenient size, the delay unit is shaped to reflect the signal multiple times through the crystal, thereby greatly reducing the required size of the crystal and thus producing a small, rectangular-shaped device.

== Electric delay lines ==
Electric delay lines are used for shorter delay times (nanoseconds to several microseconds). They consist of a long electric line or are made of discrete inductors and capacitors arranged in a chain. To shorten the total length of the line, it can be wound around a metal tube, getting some more capacitance against ground and also more inductance due to the wire windings, which are lying close together.

Other examples are:
* short coaxial or microstrip lines for phase matching in high-frequency circuits or antennas,
* hollow resonator lines in magnetrons and klystrons as helices in travelling-wave tubes to match the velocity of the electrons to the velocity of the electromagnetic waves,
* undulators in free-electron lasers.

Another way to create a delay time is to implement a delay line in an integrated circuit storage device. This can be done digitally or with a discrete-time analogue method. The analogue one uses charge transfer devices (either bucket-brigade devices or charge-coupled devices), which transport a stored electric charge stepwise from one end to the other. Both digital and analog methods are bandwidth limited at the upper end to the half of the clock frequency, which determines the steps of transportation.

In modern computers operating at gigahertz speeds, millimeter differences in the length of conductors in a parallel data bus can cause data-bit skew, which can lead to data corruption or reduced processing performance. This is remedied by making all conductor paths of similar length, delaying the arrival time for what would otherwise be shorter travel distances by using zig-zagging traces.

== Optical delay lines ==
In the field of optical computing, an optical delay line can be used in a similar fashion to how acoustic or electrical delay lines were used.

<text>Japan Airlines (JAL) is the flag carrier airline of Japan. JAL is headquartered in Shinagawa, Tokyo. Its main hubs are Tokyo&#x27;s Narita and Haneda airports, as well as secondary hubs in Osaka&#x27;s Kansai and Itami airports. The JAL group, which includes Japan Airlines, also comprises J-Air, Japan Air Commuter, Japan Transocean Air, Hokkaido Air System, and Ryukyu Air Commuter for domestic feeder services, and JAL Cargo for cargo and mail services.

JAL group operations include scheduled and non-scheduled international and domestic passenger and cargo services to 220 destinations in 35 countries worldwide, including codeshares. The group has a fleet of 279 aircraft. In the fiscal year ended 31 March 2009, the airline group carried over 52 million passengers and over 1.1 million tons of cargo and mail. Japan Airlines, J-Air, JAL Express, and Japan Transocean Air are members of the Oneworld airline alliance network.

JAL was established in 1951 as a government-owned business and became the national airline of Japan in 1953. After over three decades of service and expansion, the airline was fully privatised in 1987. In 2002, the airline merged with Japan Air System (JAS), Japan&#x27;s third-largest airline, and became the sixth-largest airline in the world by passengers carried. Japan Airlines is currently an official sponsor of Shimizu S-Pulse and Consadole Sapporo.

==History==
=== Regulated/Showa era ===
==== Founding ====

The original Japan Airlines Co. was established on 1 August 1951, with the government of Japan recognising the need for a reliable air transportation system to help Japan grow in the aftermath of World War II. The airline was founded with an initial capital of ¥100 million; its headquarters were located in Ginza, Chūō, Tokyo. Between 27 and 29 of August, the airline operated invitational flights on a Douglas DC-3 &quot;Kinsei&quot;, leased from Philippine Airlines. On 25 October, Japan&#x27;s first post-war domestic airline service was inaugurated, using a Martin 2-0-2 aircraft, named &quot;Mokusei&quot;, and crew leased from Northwest Orient Airlines subsidiary TALOA.

On 1 August 1953, the National Diet passed the forming a new state-owned Japan Airlines on 1 October, which assumed all assets and liabilities of its private predecessor. By 1953, the JAL network extended northward from Tokyo to Sapporo and Misawa, and westward to Nagoya, Osaka, Iwakuni, and Fukuoka.

On 2 February 1954, the airline began international flights, carrying 18 passengers from Tokyo to San Francisco on a Douglas DC-6B &quot;City of Tokyo&quot; via Wake Island and Honolulu. The flights between Tokyo and San Francisco are still Flights 1 and 2, to commemorate its first international service. The early flights were advertised as being operated by American crews and serviced by United Airlines in San Francisco.

The airline, in addition to the Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-6B, and Martin 2-0-2s, operated Douglas DC-4s and Douglas DC-7Cs during the 1950s. JAL flew to Hong Kong via Okinawa by 1955, having pared down its domestic network to Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Sapporo. By 1958, the Hong Kong route had been extended to Bangkok and Singapore. With DC-7Cs, JAL was able to fly nonstop between Seattle and Tokyo in 1959.

==== Jet era ====

In 1960, the airline took delivery of its first jet, a Douglas DC-8 named &quot;Fuji&quot;, introducing jet service on the Tokyo-Honolulu-San Francisco route. JAL went on to operate a fleet of 51 DC-8s, retiring the last of the type in 1987. &quot;Fuji&quot; flew until 1974 and was then used as a maintenance training platform until 1989; its nose section was stored at Haneda Airport and eventually put on public display at the JAL Sky Museum in March 2014.

JAL also began flying to Seattle and Hong Kong in 1960. At the end of 1961, JAL had transpolar flights from Tokyo to Seattle, Copenhagen, London, and Paris via Anchorage, Alaska, and to Los Angeles and San Francisco via Honolulu, Hawaii.

During the 1960s, JAL flew to many new cities, including Moscow, New York, and Busan. DC-8 flights to Europe via Anchorage started in 1961; flights to Europe via India started in 1962, initially with Convair 880s. Under government pressure, Boeing 727s were acquired for domestic services in 1965 to allow the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau to issue an import license for All Nippon Airways&#x27; (ANA) own fleet of 727s.

By 1965, Japan Airlines was headquartered in the Tokyo Building in Marunouchi, Chiyoda, Tokyo. Around this time, over half of JAL&#x27;s revenue was generated on transpacific routes to the United States, and the airline was lobbying the United States for fifth freedom rights to fly transatlantic routes from the East Coast. The transpacific route was extended east from San Francisco to New York in November 1966 and to London in 1967; flights between San Francisco and London ended in December 1972.

Between 1967 and 1969, JAL had an agreement with Aeroflot to operate a joint service between Tokyo and Moscow using a Soviet Tupolev Tu-114. The flight crew included one JAL member, and the cabin crew had five members each from Aeroflot and JAL. The weekly flight started in April 1967.

In 1972, under the , the so-called &quot;aviation constitution&quot; enacted by the Japanese government, JAL was granted flag carrier status to operate international routes. The airline was also designated to operate domestic trunk routes in competition with ANA and Toa Domestic Airlines.

The signing of a civil air transport agreement between China and Japan on 20 April 1974 caused the suspension of air routes between Taiwan and Japan on 21 April. A new subsidiary, Japan Asia Airways, was established on 8 August 1975, and air services between the two countries were restored on 15 September. During the 1970s, the airline bought the Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 for its growing routes within Japan and to other countries.
In the 1980s the airline performed special flights for the Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko of Japan, Pope John Paul II, and Japanese prime ministers. Until the introduction of dedicated government aircraft two Boeing 747-400s operated as &quot;Japanese Air Force One&quot; and &quot;Japanese Air Force Two&quot;. During that decade, the airline introduced new Boeing 747-100SR, Boeing 747-SUD, and Boeing 767 jets to the fleet and retired the Boeing 727s and Douglas DC-8s.

In 1978, JAL started flights to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro via Anchorage and San Juan; The stopover was changed to Los Angeles in 1982 and to New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport in 1999. Until 2009, the airline operated fifth-freedom flights between New York and São Paulo and between Vancouver and Mexico City.

===Deregulated era===
Japan began considering airline deregulation in the late 1970s, with the government announcing the abandoning of the 45/47 system in 1985. In 1987, Japan Airlines was completely privatised, and the other two airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways and Japan Air System, were permitted to compete with JAL on domestic and international routes. The increased competition resulted in changes to the airline&#x27;s corporate structure, and it was reorganized into three divisions: international passenger service, domestic passenger service, and cargo (including mail) service.

===Heisei era===

Japan Airlines began the 1990s with flights to evacuate Japanese citizens from Iraq before the start of the Gulf War. In October 1990, Japan Air Charter was established, and in September 1996, an agreement with the Walt Disney Company made Japan Airlines the official airline of Tokyo Disneyland. JAL Express was established in April 1997, with Boeing 737 aircraft. In the 1990s, the airline experienced economic difficulties that stemmed from recessions in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as a domestic downturn. Despite years of profits since 1986, the airline began to report operating losses in 1992. Cost-cutting, including the formation of the low-cost JAL Express domestic subsidiary and the transfer of tourist operations to JALways (the successor to Japan Air Charter), helped return the airline to profitability in 1999.

In 1997, the airline flew Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Peru to help negotiate in the Japanese embassy hostage crisis. Japan Airlines placed orders for Boeing 777s during the 1990s, allowing for fleet renewal. It was one of eight airlines participating in the Boeing 777 design process, shaping the design to their specifications.

In 2001, Japan Air System and Japan Airlines agreed to merge; and on 2 October 2002, they established a new holding company called , forming a new core of the JAL Group. Aircraft liveries were changed to match the design of the new JAL Group. At that time, the merged group of airlines was the sixth largest in the world by passengers carried.

On 1 April 2004, JAL changed its name to Japan Airlines International and JAS changed its name to Japan Airlines Domestic. JAS flight codes were changed to JAL flight codes, JAS check-in desks were refitted in JAL livery, and JAS aircraft were gradually repainted. On 26 June 2004, the parent company Japan Airlines System was renamed to Japan Airlines Corporation.

Following the merger, two companies operated under the JAL brand: and . Japan Airlines Domestic had primary responsibility for JAL&#x27;s large network of intra-Japan flights, while JAL International operated both international and trunk domestic flights. On 1 October 2006, Japan Airlines International and Japan Airlines Domestic merged into a single brand, Japan Airlines International.

The airline applied to join Oneworld on 25 October 2005. Japan Airlines claimed that its Oneworld membership would be in the best interests of the airline&#x27;s plans to further develop the airline group and its strong commitment to providing the very best to its customers. Japan Airlines, together with Malév and Royal Jordanian, joined the alliance on 1 April 2007.

On 1 April 2008, JAL merged the operations of its subsidiary Japan Asia Airways (JAA) into JAL mainline operations. JAA had operated all JAL group flights between Japan and Taiwan between 1975 and 2008 as a separate entity due to the special political status of Taiwan.
In 2009, Japan Airlines suffered steep financial losses, despite remaining Asia&#x27;s largest airline by revenue. As a result, the airline embarked on staff cuts and route cutbacks in an effort to reduce costs. The carrier also received ¥100 billion through capital injection and credit from the Japanese government as part of the proposed bankruptcy. In September 2009, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism formed a task force aimed at aiding a corporate turnaround at JAL, which examined various cost-cutting and strategic partnership proposals.

One proposal considered was to merge JAL with ANA, which would create a single larger international airline and replace Japan Airlines International; however, media reports suggested that ANA would oppose this proposal given its comparatively better financial performance as an independent carrier. The task force also examined possible partnerships with foreign carriers.

After weeks of speculation, JAL applied for protection under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law (the Japanese equivalent of Administration in the United Kingdom or a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States) on 19 January 2010. JAL would receive a ¥300 billion cash injection and have debts worth ¥730 billion waived, in exchange for which it will cut its capital to zero, cut unprofitable routes and reduce its workforce by 15,700 employees—a third of its 47,000 total. JAL&#x27;s main creditors (Mizuho Corporate Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) originally objected to the bankruptcy declaration, but changed their positions after the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan recommended court protection, according to a senior bank official. Shares of JAL were delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 20 February 2010. At a time, its stock was considered one of &quot;bluest of blue chips&quot; of Japan. At the time, the bankruptcy was the largest Japanese bankruptcy involving a non-financial company and the fourth largest in Japan&#x27;s history.

Kazuo Inamori, founder of Kyocera and KDDI, took over as CEO of JAL. Transport minister Seiji Maehara personally visited Kyocera headquarters in late 2009 to persuade Inamori to accept the position; task force leader Shinjiro Takagi believed that appointing a proven entrepreneur CEO was necessary to fix the various problems at JAL. Japan Air Commuter president Masaru Onishi was promoted to president of JAL.

In May, JAL began to see an increase in its passenger numbers by 1.1% year-on-year. In August, it was reported that JAL would cut 19,133 jobs from its workforce of 47,000 by the end of March 2015 – whilst also increasing capacity – in an attempt to make the business viable.

Although JAL ultimately exited bankruptcy while remaining in the Oneworld alliance, JAL was seriously considering accepting a strategic investment from Delta Air Lines and joining the SkyTeam alliance during the period between September 2009 and February 2010. JAL also had talks with Skyteam members Air France-KLM and Korean Air regarding their potential involvement.

The Delta deal was favored by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism because Delta had an extensive global network and had the largest Japanese operation of any foreign airline, which it had inherited through its merger with Northwest Airlines. MLITT also supported a transaction with Air France-KLM because it was a &quot;healthier company&quot; than American.

American planned to team up with Oneworld alliance members British Airways and Qantas to make a joint offer to recapitalise JAL. British Airways said that it was attempting to persuade JAL to remain part of Oneworld rather than aligning itself with Delta and SkyTeam, while American CEO Gerard Arpey said that American and Oneworld remained committed to a partnership with Japan Airlines, as long as it remained a major international carrier, and reiterated his encouragement for JAL to stay with Oneworld during ceremonies to welcome Mexicana into the alliance.

In an interview with the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; on 1 January 2010, JAL president Haruka Nishimatsu stated his preference in forming a partnership with Delta over American, and the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; reported shortly thereafter that JAL and the Japanese government-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation would likely choose to form a business and capital tie-up with Delta, as part of which JAL would enter SkyTeam and reduce its international flight operations in favor of code-share agreements with Delta, and that American Airlines had begun procedures to end negotiations with JAL. Both JAL and American denied the report. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; then reported that American Airlines raised its JAL investment offer by $300 million, to $1.4 billion, and in separate comments to the press, Delta president Ed Bastian said that Delta was &quot;willing and able to raise additional capital through third-party resources.&quot;
After JAL filed for bankruptcy, there were further media reports that JAL would leave Oneworld in favour of SkyTeam, but JAL president Masaru Onishi said on 1 February that the new JAL leadership was &quot;seriously reviewing the issue from scratch, without being influenced by previous discussions,&quot; and its decision on an alliance partner would be made soon.

On 7 February, several news outlets reported that JAL would decide to keep its alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. Inamori and ETIC officials, according to the reports, decided that switching alliances from Oneworld to Skyteam would be too risky and could hinder JAL&#x27;s ability to turn around quickly. Two days later, JAL officially announced that it would strengthen its partnership with American, including a joint application for antitrust immunity on transpacific routes. The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.

JAL emerged from bankruptcy protection in March 2011. In July, ETIC selected Nomura Holdings, Daiwa Securities, MUFG Bank, Morgan Stanley, Mizuho Securities, SMBC, and Nikko Securities to underwrite the sale of its equity stake in JAL, without specifying amounts or dates. On 6 January 2012, JAL announced its intent to relist its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in an initial public offering (IPO) of up to ¥1 trillion, which would be the largest offering in Japan in more than a year. The airline completed its IPO on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange () on 19 September 2012. The Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan sold all its holdings (96.5%) in JAL for ¥650 billion, greater than its ¥350 billion investment in 2010.

Following its exit from bankruptcy protection, JAL began several new partnerships within the Oneworld alliance. The transpacific joint venture between JAL and American commenced in April 2011. JAL formed Jetstar Japan, a low-cost carrier joint venture with Qantas subsidiary Jetstar Airways, in July. In 2012, JAL and British Airways parent company International Airlines Group (IAG) submitted applications to the Japanese government and European Union respectively in seeking a joint venture business operation for flights between Japan and Europe. Finnair applied to join the JV with IAG in July 2013, in conjunction with JAL starting new nonstop service to Helsinki.

===Reiwa era===
Between 2020 and 2021, Japan Airlines incorporated numerous safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Japan Airlines undertakes JAL FlySafe hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the virus, to provide all Japan Airlines guests with a safe and secure travel experience. Measures taken by Japan Airlines to protect guests and keep them safe from infection include face masks and face guards worn by airport staff, disinfecting areas around seats, including tables, armrests, screens, and controllers, and sanitizing frequently touched surfaces, such as lavatory doorknobs and faucet handles.

On June 18, 2021, Japan airlines announced it had conducted the first flight with loading 2 different types of Sustainable Aviation Fuel produced domestically in Japan. The flight was directed from Tokyo (Haneda) to Sapporo (Shin-Chitose) and used 3,132 litters (9.1% mixing ratio) of SAF sourced from wood chips and from microalgae. It was the first flight in the world to use biofuel derived from gasified wood chips and to mix two different types of biofuels.

In May 2023, JAL announced its intention to reintroduce dedicated cargo service using Boeing 767-300BCF aircraft converted from its passenger fleet. This service is planned to begin in early 2024. The company retired its previous fleet of Boeing 747 freighters in 2011.

=== Business trends ===
The key trends of Japan Airlines are (as at the financial year ending March 31):
===Organization===
In addition to its operations under the JAL name, the airline owns five domestic airlines which feed or supplement mainline JAL flights:

* J-Air (JLJ) (member of oneworld) – regional jet services based in Osaka International Airport
* Japan Air Commuter (JAC) (member of oneworld) – turboprop services based in Kagoshima and several destinations out of Kagoshima
* Hokkaido Air System (HAC) (member of oneworld) – turboprop services based in Hokkaido and several destinations out of Hokkaido
* Japan Transocean Air (JTA) (member of oneworld) – jet services from/to Okinawa

Former subsidiaries:
* JALways was the airline&#x27;s international subsidiary, which handled low-yield flights to resort destinations in Hawaii, Oceania, and Southeast Asia.
* JAL Express (JEX) was the airline&#x27;s low-cost carrier for jet services between secondary cities, it merged into Japan Airlines in 2014.
*Japan Asia Airways (JAA) was the airline&#x27;s subsidiary formed in 1975 to allow JAL to fly to the Republic of China (Taiwan) without compromising traffic rights held by the airline for destinations in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The mainland does not recognize Taiwan as a sovereign nation but instead as a breakaway province and threatened to ban any foreign airline that has a Taiwan route from flying to the mainland. Japan Asia Airways was dissolved in 2008 when JAL was privatized, allowing the airline to fly to Taiwan in its own right.

JALUX Inc., established in 1962, is the airline&#x27;s procurement business which handles various work for the company, including the JAL SELECTION merchandise and in-flight meals and refreshments, supplies for Blue Sky and JAL-DFS shops, aircraft fuel components, cabin services, and in-flight duty-free. JALUX merged with JAS Trading on 1 January 2004, to unify support operations for the JAL group.

JAL Cargo is the brand of the airline group&#x27;s freight service and is a member of the WOW cargo alliance with these products: J Speed, General Cargo, and Dangerous Goods. In the fiscal year ended 31 March 2009, the cargo division carried 500,779 tonnes of freight domestically and 627,213 tonnes of freight internationally.

On 1 April 2011, the airline changed its trade name from to . in the first quarter of 2019, JAL launches its low-cost carrier, Zipair Tokyo, which will focus on medium to long-haul destinations. It is estimated to commence operation in summer 2020.

===Headquarters===
The headquarters, the , is located on Tennōzu Isle in Higashi Shinagawa, Shinagawa, Tokyo. The 26-floor building was a project of the Kajima Corporation. The building, which also has two underground levels, has a land area of and a floor area of .

Several divisions of JAL, including JALPAK, JAL Aero-Consulting, and JAL Hotels are located in the building. The building also houses the Japan office of American Airlines. It is also known as the , the Japan Airlines Headquarters, and the Shinagawa Kyodo Building.

When JAL was originally established in 1951, its headquarters were in Ginza, Chuo, Tokyo. By 1965, Japan Airlines was headquartered in the Tokyo Building in Marunouchi, Chiyoda, Tokyo. The &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; stated that because Japan Airlines worked closely with the Japanese government, people mockingly referred to the Tokyo Building as &quot;a branch office of the transport ministry.&quot;

On 28 June 1996, construction was completed on the JAL Building. On 27 July 1996, JAL moved its headquarters into the JAL Building. The Flight Operation Center at the JAL Building began on 20 September 1996. A holding company for JAL and Japan Airlines System, a carrier merging into JAL, was established on 2 October 2002; the head office of that company, , was in 2-15-1 Kōnan in Shinagawa Intercity, Minato, Tokyo. On 11 August 2003, the headquarters of JAS moved from Haneda Maintenance Centre 1 to the JAL Building. On 25 November 2003, the JALS headquarters moved to the JAL Building. Originally the JAL Building was co-owned by Japan Airlines and Mitsubishi Trading Co.; they co-owned a subsidiary that owned the JAL Building. In 2004, the building was to be sold to Nomura Real Estate for 65 billion yen. The contract date was 1 December 2004, and the handover date was 18 March 2005.

The JAL Subsidiary JALUX Inc. at one time had its headquarters in the JAL Building. One group of employees moved out of the building on 26 July 2010, and one moved out on 2 August 2010.

===Livery===

====Logo and basic liveries====


The JAL livery is called the or &quot;crane circle.&quot; It is an image of a Japanese red-crown crane with its wings extended in full flight. The Tsurumaru JAL logo was created in 1958 by Jerry Huff, the creative director at Botsford, Constantine and Gardner of San Francisco, which had been the advertising agency for Japan Airlines from its earliest days. JAL had used several logos up until 1958. When the airline arranged to buy new Douglas DC-8s, it decided to create a new official logo for the inauguration of its jet service worldwide.

In the creation of the logo, Huff was inspired by the personal crests of Samurai families. In a book he&#x27;d been given, &quot;We Japanese&quot;, he found pages of crests, including the crane. On his choice of the crane, he writes: &quot;I had faith that it was the perfect symbol for Japan Airlines. I found that the Crane myth was all positive—it mates for life (loyalty), and flies high for miles without tiring (strength)&quot;.

The &quot;tsurumaru&quot; livery was in use until 2002 when it was replaced by a livery called the &quot;Arc of the Sun.&quot; The livery featured the motif of a rising sun on a creamy parchment-coloured background.

JAL is a strong supporter of UNICEF and expresses its support by having a &quot;We Support UNICEF&quot; logo on each aircraft.

Following its corporate restructuring, Japan Airlines returned to the classic &quot;tsurumaru&quot; logo starting on 1 April 2011. A Boeing 767-300 (JA8299) was the last remaining aircraft that had the &quot;Arc of the Sun&quot; livery until it was retired in January 2016.

====Special liveries====
JAL is known for adopting special liveries. A Boeing 747 (JA8908) carried a World Cup soccer livery in 2002. Another Boeing 747 (JA8907) was the &quot;Matsui Jet&quot;, featuring the famous Japanese baseball player Hideki Matsui in 2003. One of the airline&#x27;s Boeing 767-300 (JA8253) was the &quot;Expo 2005&quot; aircraft.

Various aircraft in the JAL fleet also carry a &quot;Yokoso Japan&quot; logo supporting the Visit Japan campaign, in various forms. In late 2005, Japan Airlines began using a Boeing 777 (JA8941), featuring Japanese actor Shingo Katori on one side, and the television series &quot;Saiyuki&quot;, along with its main character &quot;Goku&quot; on the other side.

JAL has also been known for its liveries featuring Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, as it is the official airline of the Tokyo Disney Resort. It sponsors the attraction Star Jets (not related to past Star Jets fleet with the old &quot;tsurumaru&quot; livery), which features a variation of the current livery on the ride vehicles. At one time there were more than six widebody aircraft painted with the special liveries.

Some Boeing 747s of JAL had also been painted with tropical-influenced liveries along with &quot;Reso&#x27;cha&quot; titles. These aircraft were typically used by JALways on charter flights to holiday destinations in the Pacific, such as Hawaii. &quot;Reso&#x27;cha&quot; was a marketing abbreviation for Resort Charter and were formerly known as JAL Super Resort Express.
In April 2007, JAL debuted a Boeing 777-300 (JA8941, since moved to JA752J) with a special Oneworld livery to promote the airlines&#x27;s entry to the global airline alliance. Previously this aircraft carried the Shingo Katori and the &quot;Saiyuki&quot; television livery.

JAL repainted a Boeing 777-200 (JA8984) in 2008 and a Boeing 777-300ER (JA731J) in 2009 to have a green rather than red arc on its tail, along with a green origami airplane on the fuselage, and named them the &quot;Eco Jet&quot;, to highlight the company&#x27;s efforts to reduce the environmental impact of commercial aviation. Following the brand image change to the third Tsurumaru livery, JAL redesigned the 2 &quot;Eco Jet&quot; liveries. JA8984&#x27;s livery was removed in April 2019 prior to its retirement in December 2019 while JA731J&#x27;s livery was moved onto JA734J (another JAL 777-300ER), which continues flying the &quot;Eco Jet&quot; livery as of March 2020.

In 2009, JAL repainted JA8941 again, as well as a JTA 737-400 (JA8933) to promote Kobukuro and their new album &quot;Calling&quot; as well as a live concert tour in Okinawa and around Japan. This livery was released officially on 30 July 2009.

On 4 September 2010, in conjunction with the &quot;Boku no Miteiru Fūkei&quot; album, JAL and Arashi (one of their songs, &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;, is used for a commercial) introduced a new livery on one of its Boeing 777-200 JA8982 featuring the five members of Arashi in the aircraft; the first flight was on the next day, 5 September. In May 2019, JAL also painted one of its Boeing 787-9 JA873J the &quot;ARASHI HAWAII JET&quot; livery, and in November, painted an Airbus A350-900 JA04XJ the &quot;20th ARASHI THANKS JET&quot; livery to celebrate the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

On 3 August 2017, JAL announced a new livery on board an Embraer 190 of subsidiary J-Air, in commemoration of the new Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem ride in Universal Studios Japan.

Starting from April 2019, JAL introduced the &#x27;Tokyo 2020, Fly For it!&#x27; series of special liveries, in commemoration of the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics and featuring the two mascots of the 2020 Olympics. Two jetliners in the JAL fleet have been painted so far, JA773J (a Boeing 777-200, painted April 2019) and JA601J (a Boeing 767-300ER, painted July 2019)

In December 2022, JAL and The Walt Disney Company Japan introduced a special livery on its Boeing 767-300ER JA615J in commemoration of the upcoming &quot;Disney 100 Years of Wonder&quot; celebration for Walt Disney Company&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2023.

===Branding===
In 1959, Japan Airlines adopted their logo, which is a crane known as the &#x27;Tsuru&#x27; crane, along with a livery featuring a white top with the text &quot;JAPAN AIR LINES&quot; in capital italic letters, an exposed-metal bottom, and red and dark blue pinstripes separating the two.

Landor Associates created JAL&#x27;s 1989 brand identity, along with a livery that featured a new stylized JAL initialism with a red square and grey band on the front of fuselage, and the name &quot;Japan Airlines&quot; featured in small black text. The 1989 livery retained the &#x27;Tsuru&#x27; crane logo on the tail but with the same stylised JAL lettering incorporated within it.

After Japan Airlines and Japan Air System merged in 2004, the Tokyo office of Landor and JAL worked together again to create a new brand identity. Landor devised a livery referred to as the &quot;Arc of the Sun&quot;. The 2000s rebranding began in April 2002 and was completed in April 2004. The brand identity firm designed 300,000 specific items for JAL. The JAL acronym remained, but it was changed to include a curved bar, which replaced the simple red square and gray rectangle used from 1989. The curved bar was likened to a samurai sword. The tail now featured a quarter sun outlined in silver.

JAL changed its branding again on 1 April 2011 as part of their post-bankruptcy restructuring. The new livery was reminiscent of the original 1959 one, featured the tsurumaru back on the vertical stabilizer and the full name in capital italic letters above the windows, but did not include the pinstripes or exposed metal bottom, and retained the two-word &quot;JAPAN AIRLINES&quot; spelling over the original &quot;JAPAN AIR LINES&quot;. Repainting was completed in January 2016.

==Destinations==

Japan Airlines serves 60 domestic destinations and 39 international destinations in Asia, the Americas, Europe and Oceania, excluding codeshare agreements. The airline&#x27;s international hubs are Tokyo&#x27;s Narita International Airport and Haneda Airport, Osaka&#x27;s Kansai International Airport and Itami Airport. Japan Airlines and its subsidiaries currently operate over 4,500 international flights and 26,000 domestic flights monthly.

In the fiscal year ended 31 March 2009, the airline introduced or increased services on ten international routes, including between Tokyo (Narita) and New York City, and between Osaka (Kansai) and Shanghai; and it ceased operations on four international routes, including between Tokyo (Narita) and Xi&#x27;an, and between Osaka (Kansai) and Qingdao. Domestically, JAL suspended 14 routes, including between Sapporo and Okinawa. Additionally, the airline expanded codesharing alliance with fellow Oneworld partners like American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific and Finnair, and other airlines, including Air France, China Eastern and Jetstar.

In the early years, Narita International Airport had been the main hub of international and freight flights. Nowadays, Haneda Airport is becoming a major international hub due to its close proximity to the Tokyo metropolis, and the heavy expansion occurring there.

=== Cabin classes ===

==== A350-1000 cabin ====
In January 2024, Japan Airlines debuted new First, Business, Premium Economy, and Economy class cabins on their A350-1000 fleet of aircraft. These cabins include enclosed suites, manufactured by Safran GB, and in-seat audio in the First and Business class cabins. The A350-1000 includes 6 First class seats in a 1-1-1 layout, 54 Business class seats in a 1-2-1 layout, 24 Premium Economy seats in a 2-4-2 layout, and 155 Economy seats in a 3-3-3 layout.

====New cabin====
JAL introduced new international First and Executive Class seats: the &quot;JAL Suite&quot; for First Class, featured a seat 20 percent roomier than the Skysleeper Solo in a 1-2-1 configuration; and the &quot;JAL Shell Flat Neo Seat&quot; for Executive Class Seasons, a slightly revised version of the original Shell Flat Seat, with a wider seat; expanded center console; and the world&#x27;s first in-flight photo art exhibit, &quot;Sky Gallery&quot;. These seats, along with the Premium Economy seats, debuted on Japan Airlines Flights 5 and 6, operated on the Tokyo–New York route on 1 August 2008. It expanded to the Tokyo–San Francisco route on 13 September 2008, and the Tokyo–Chicago and Los Angeles in 2009. Between 2010 and 2017, the new cabin was also flown on flights from Narita to Jakarta, the only Asian destination for which the new cabin was used during that period.

In 2013, JAL debuted new versions of its economy and premium economy seats called Sky Premium and Sky Wider Economy respectively. The Sky Premium seats, found on selected 777-300s and soon 787s, feature the same width as the Sky Shell seats but with a 4&quot; larger seat pitch of 42&quot; and a 3&quot; larger recline of up to 10&quot; compared to a 38&quot; pitch and 7&quot; recline on the Sky Shell seats. The Sky Wider Economy seats, found on select 767s and select 777-300s, feature slimmer seats with 4&quot; more legroom, and another inch of width totaling up to 35&quot; of seat pitch, and a 19&quot; width compared to the 31&quot; pitch and 18&quot; width of standard economy seats, plus a larger PTV screen of up to 11&quot;. The newer 787s will feature a new version of the Sky Wider seats called Sky Wider II, which will feature 5&quot; more legroom and 2&quot; more width totaling up to 36&quot; of seat pitch and a 20&quot; width in a less dense 2-4-2 setup instead of the 3-3-3 setup commonly used in a 787&#x27;s economy cabin.

In premium cabins, JAL introduced fully lie-flat seats, branded as Sky Suite in Business Class cabin and enhanced First Suite seats in First Class cabin. The Sky Suite is in a staggered 2-3-2 setup that offer direct aisle access to all business class passengers. These can be found on all 13 of JAL&#x27;s Boeing 777-300ER aircraft (named SS7), 10 of JAL&#x27;s 787-8 aircraft (named SS8) and eight of JAL&#x27;s 787-9 aircraft (named SS9). Later in 2015, JAL introduced a new version of Sky Suite, called Sky Suite II, in order to fit lie-flat seats on its new international 767-300ER fleet (named SS6), in a 1-2-1 setup. Since the seats are less wide than the original Sky Suite, SS6 aircraft are often seen on shorter international routes, like inter-Asian routes and Hawaiian routes. In 2016, as JAL was upgrading its Boeing 777-200ER fleet used on selected inter-Asian and Hawaiian flights, JAL introduced a third version of Sky Suite, called Sky Suite III, which is a lie-flat reverse-herringbone arranged seat. This seat is equipped on JAL&#x27;s most Boeing 777-200ER fleet (named SS2) and five of JAL&#x27;s Boeing 787-9 fleet (named SS9 II) in a 1-2-1 setup. Like SS6 aircraft, SS2 and SS9 II aircraft are operating on shorter international routes.

====International services====

===In-flight entertainment===
====MAGIC====

&quot;MAGIC&quot;, JAL&#x27;s in-flight entertainment system, supported by the JAL Mooove! (formerly Entertainment Network), features the latest hit movies and videos, games and audio programs. There are six generations of the &quot;MAGIC&quot; system: &quot;MAGIC-I&quot;, &quot;MAGIC-II&quot;, &quot;MAGIC-III&quot;, &quot;MAGIC-IV&quot;, &quot;MAGIC-V&quot; and the new &quot;MAGIC-VI&quot;. Introduced on 1 December 2007, the &quot;MAGIC-III&quot; system provides Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD) entertainment to all passengers. The number of movie, music, video and game channels on &quot;MAGIC-III&quot; was doubled from 57 to 130 by 2008; and it is installed on all seats on Boeing 767-300ER, 777-200ER and 777-300ER aircraft. Aircraft with &quot;MAGIC-I&quot; and &quot;MAGIC-II&quot; have movies that automatically start when the AVOD system is turned on—once the aircraft reaches cruise level—and economy class passengers can tune in to watch the movie in progress; and all movies restart upon completion. Executive and First Class passengers have full AVOD control. &quot;MAGIC&quot; systems also have JAL&#x27;s duty-free shopping catalogue, including flight crew recommendations and a video of specials available on the flight. &quot;MAGIC-V&quot; will feature mostly the same entertainment as &quot;MAGIC-III&quot;, but with a touch screen controller, along with a handset. There will be USB ports for iPod connectivity, and an easier to control handset. (introduced on selected Boeing 767-300ER routes).
The &quot;MAGIC-III&quot; system is used on internationally configured Boeing 767-300 with Skyluxe Seat, older internationally configured Boeing 767-300ER with Skyluxe Seat, all Boeing 777-200ER, older Boeing 777-300ER with Skysleeper Solo/Suite first class and Shell Flat Seat/Neo Business class. The &quot;MAGIC-IV&quot; is used on internationally configured Boeing 737-800s, along with a newer look of Skyluxe Seat. It uses 9-inch touchscreens by Panasonic SFX. The &quot;MAGIC-V&quot; system is deploying across the fleet, with selected Boeing 767-300ERs (Skyrecliner seat) and B787-8 (Shell Flat Neo seat) getting the IFE. Followed by refurbished Boeing 777-300ERs (all aircraft) and selected Boeing 767-300ER aircraft (including those with Skyluxe seat) will get the &quot;MAGIC-V&quot; along with new seats in all classes. The &quot;MAGIC-VI&quot; is installed on selected Boeing 787-8s and 777-300s.

====Aircraft cameras====

On most JAL international flights, on-plane cameras are available, either on the wings, the belly or on the tail. When the aircraft is in the pushback; taxi; take-off; ascent; descent; stacking; landing; and docking phases of flight, all TV&#x27;s in the cabin automatically tune into the video camera outside the aircraft to provide &quot;Pilot Vision&quot; to the passengers. However, new entertainment systems do not have them anymore (except the airline&#x27;s new A350, which does have cameras).

====Additional media====
&quot;Skyward&quot;, the airline group&#x27;s inflight magazine, reflects the company motto of &quot;Dream Skyward&quot;. Before the merger with JAS, JAL&#x27;s inflight magazine was called &quot;Winds&quot;. All of the JAL Group magazines are provided by JALUX.

In a promotion, between 1 June and 31 August 2006, all Executive and First Class passengers would be offered the use of Nintendo DS Lites specially manufactured for air travel, with the wireless capabilities removed to conform with airline safety standards. 

After a trial run at Haneda airport, JAL announced it will offer selected passengers a VR experience using the Samsung Gear VR and the Samsung S8. Passengers will be able to experience specially curated programming in Germany, Argentina, the Nagoya fireworks and more programs at a later date.

===In-flight catering===
Japan Airlines offers meals on intercontinental routes, depending on the cabin class, destination and flight length. Western and Japanese menu selections are typically offered, including seasonal menu selections varied by destination. The airline has worked with high-profile chefs, including Fumiko Kono, Shinichi Sato, Koji Shimomura, Naoki Uchiyama, Chikara Yamada, Seiji Yamammoto and Hiroki Yoshitake in the creation of its menus and in 2016, launched a children&#x27;s menu created by Kono, Yamada, Yamammoto, and Yosuke Suga.

===Sakura Lounge===

Sakura Lounge, named after the Japanese word for cherry blossom, is Japan Airlines&#x27; signature lounge. In addition, the airline also operates the following international, including First Class Lounge, Sakura Lounge annex and JAL Lounge; and domestic lounges, including Diamond Premier Lounge and JAL Lounge. Access to the lounges depend on the class of travel or the membership status in the JAL Mileage Bank or JAL Global Club.

==Incidents and accidents==
==In popular culture==
Japan Airlines has been the focus of several television programs in Japan over the years, most being dramas revolving around cabin attendants. &quot;Attention Please&quot; was a drama in 1970 that followed the story of a young girl who joined JAL to be a cabin attendant while overcoming many difficulties. This show was remade in 2006 again as &quot;Attention Please&quot; starring Aya Ueto who joins a class of cabin attendant nominees and later graduates. Most of the action of the story of the 2006 series takes place at JAL&#x27;s Haneda flight operations headquarters. The series has had two specials since the original, marking the main character&#x27;s transition into JAL&#x27;s international operations.

During the 1980s, JAL was also the focus of another drama entitled &quot;Stewardess Monogatari&quot; which featured another young girl during training to be a JAL cabin attendant. During the 1990s, JAL featured several commercials with celebrities, including Janet Jackson who danced and sang to a backdrop of JAL 747s on rotation at LAX.

In Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Dodo Airlines is a parody of Japan Airlines.

<text>The T-62 is a Soviet main battle tank that was first introduced in 1961. As a further development of the T-55 series, the T-62 retained many similar design elements of its predecessor including low profile and thick turret armour.

In contrast with previous tanks, which were armed with rifled tank guns, the T-62 was the first production tank armed with a smoothbore tank gun which could fire APFSDS rounds at higher velocities (the U.S. prototype T95 medium tank was the first tank ever built with a smoothbore gun).

While the T-62 became the standard tank in the Soviet arsenal, it did not fully replace the T-55 in export markets due to its higher manufacturing costs and maintenance requirements compared to its predecessor.

Although it was followed by later models in successor states of the Soviet Union, the T-62 remains in reserve in some countries formerly part of the USSR and in frontline use by other countries. Design features of the T-62 became standardized in subsequent Soviet and Russian mass-produced tanks.

== Development history ==
=== The initial requirements ===
By the late 1950s, Soviet commanders realised that the T-55&#x27;s 100 mm gun could not penetrate the frontal armour of newer Western tanks, such as the Centurion and M48 Patton, with standard armour-piercing shells. While 100 mm high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunition could have done the job, they were much less accurate than APDS shells, and the relatively low flight velocity resulted in poorer accuracy if used on moving targets. It was decided to up-gun the T-55 with a 115 mm smoothbore gun, able to fire kinetic energy penetrator armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds.

Trials showed that the T-55 was inherently unsuited to mount the larger weapon and work began on a new tank. The bigger gun required a bigger turret and turret ring to absorb the higher recoil. This in turn necessitated a larger hull, as the T-55 hull was simply too small to accept the new turret. The T-62 thus took shape, marking an evolutionary improvement on the T-55.

=== Obiekt 140 ===

After the delivery of the T-54 design, its lead designer Alexander Morozov turned his attention to a new design, the Obiekt 430. Obiekt 430 had a hull of welded rolled steel plates and a turret of cast and forged steel. The turret had three-layer armour with an overall thickness of 185 mm to 240 mm. It was armed with the new 100 mm D-54TS tank gun.

During this period, simpler upgrades to the existing T-54 design were assigned to a young engineer, Leonid N. Kartsev, the head of the OKB-520 design bureau of Uralvagonzavod factory (UVZ) in Nizhny Tagil. He had already led the development of the relatively minor upgrades to the T-54 that produced the T-54A (Obiekt 137G) and T-54B (Obiekt 137G2).

Kartsev and his design team started working on a new tank, called Obiekt 140 (this was also informally called the T-54M). The new tank had a torsion bar suspension with six road wheels made of aluminium. The turret was cast and armed with the same D-54TS tank gun and included the Molniya two-plane stabilization system. The tank carried 50 rounds and was powered by a V-36 diesel engine developed by engineer Artiemejev. The engine was placed on the bottom of the hull, a solution that reduced the height of the engine compartment. The Obiekt 140 weighed 37.6 tonnes.

In 1957, Uralvagonzavod built two Obiekt 140 prototypes which were put on trials soon after. The Obiekt 140 would be more expensive in serial production. Forced to abandon the Obiekt 140, Kartsev started working on yet another T-54 modernisation called the Obiekt 155. This design was more similar to the original T-54, but incorporated one useful feature from the Obiekt 140; the upper fuel tanks were fitted with mounts for tank gun ammunition. This increased the ammunition load carried by the tank to 45 rounds.

=== T-62A (Object 165) ===

At the end of 1958, Kartsev decided to modernise the Ob&#x27;yekt 140 turret. He fitted it with a cartridge-case ejector and mounted it onto a stretched T-55 chassis. He also considered that designs based on already produced vehicles had a higher chance of acceptance. The Ob&#x27;yekt 140 turret diameter, bigger than the T-55 turret by 249 mm, made redesigning the central part of the hull necessary.

Kartsev changed the arrangement of the torsion beams, which was necessary to keep the tank&#x27;s weight balanced. The tank received the designation &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt 165&quot; and in November 1958 three prototypes were built. In January 1962, the Ob&#x27;yekt 165 was accepted for service under the name T-62A. In the same year, Factory #183 produced five tanks that were put into experimental service.

=== Object 166 ===

While working on a new tank, Kartsev was looking for a more powerful tank gun. The 100 mm D-10T and D-54 tank guns had a fierce opponent in the form of the British L7A1 tank gun. The Soviets decided to &quot;recaliber&quot; the already existing 100 mm D-54TS tank gun. The modifications made to the gun included removing the rifling of the gun, reducing the profile of the bullet chamber, removing the muzzle brake, lengthening the gun tube, adding an automatic cartridge-case ejector, and adding a bore evacuator in the middle of the gun tube (as opposed to the D-54TS tank gun, which had a bore evacuator at the muzzle).

The new 115 mm tank gun was designated U-5TS &quot;Molot&quot; Rapira. It was the first smoothbore tank gun to go into serial production where it received the designation 2A20. It was put in trials against the D-10TS tank gun, which armed the T-54B as well as some T-55 and T-55A medium tanks. These trials showed that the under-calibre projectiles fired from the U-5TS had a nearly 200 m/sec higher muzzle velocity. It became apparent that the maximum range of the new tank gun was almost double that of the D-10TS. The only serious drawback of the U-5TS tank gun was the fact that it was not as accurate as the D-10TS, because of the lack of rifling. However, the greater range of the gun and its extremely high muzzle velocity made the poor accuracy less of an issue.

The new U-5TS smoothbore tank gun was fitted into the Ob&#x27;yekt 140 turret at the end of 1960. The new tank received the designation &quot;Ob&#x27;yekt 166&quot;. In 1960, both Ob&#x27;yekt 165 and Ob&#x27;yekt 166 prototypes passed their trials. Uralvagonzavod was preparing to start serial production of the new tank, though the General Armoured Directorate (GBTU) was paying much more attention to Morozov&#x27;s Ob&#x27;yekt 430, which was in development since early 1952.

Morozov was supported by General Dmitry Ustinov, who was in charge of the Soviet military industry at the time. He did not see it as necessary to produce the new tank from Uralvagonzavod, but soon the situation changed dramatically with the appearance of a new American main battle tank, the M60. In 1961, Soviet military intelligence discovered that Britain was working on a new main battle tank armed with a 120 mm tank gun. Because of this, Marshal Vasily Chuikov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army&#x27;s Ground Forces, demanded an explanation of the &quot;Kartsev&#x27;s tanks&quot; case.

At a conference of GBTU and the Soviet ground forces committee, it became apparent that Morozov&#x27;s Ob&#x27;yekt 430 tank was only 10% better than the serial T-55. Because of this, Morozov&#x27;s project was deemed a complete failure. Though the representatives of Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau disclosed their work on the improved Ob&#x27;yekt 432 (which would ultimately become the T-64), Chuikov demanded that production of the Ob&#x27;yekt 166 medium tank be started immediately.

The OKB-520 design bureau of Uralvagonzavod provided another design, the Ob&#x27;yekt 167, which was the Ob&#x27;yekt 166 with a new more powerful V-26 engine using a charger, developing 700 hp (522 kW). Two prototypes were built in the middle of 1961 and passed the trials. This time the GBTU decided not to wait for the new medium tank to pass trials, and sent the Ob&#x27;yekt 166 into mass production in July 1961. The Ob&#x27;yekt 165 also entered service in very small numbers, under the designation T-62A.

== Design ==

The T-62 has a typical tank layout: driver&#x27;s compartment at the front, fighting compartment in the centre and engine compartment in the rear. The four-man crew consists of the commander, driver, gunner and loader. Although the T-62 is very similar to the T-55 and makes use of many of the same parts, there are some differences. These include the hull, which is a few centimetres longer and wider, the different road wheels, and differences in characteristic uneven gaps between road wheels. Unlike the T-54 and T-55 medium tanks, the gaps between the last three pairs of road wheels are larger than the rest.

=== Armament ===

The armament consists of the 115 mm U-5TS &quot;Molot&quot; (2A20) Rapira smoothbore tank gun with a two-axis &quot;Meteor&quot; stabiliser and 7.62 mm PKT coaxial general-purpose machine gun mounted on the right of the main gun. The 12.7 mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun is mounted on the loader&#x27;s hatch. It was optional until 1972 when all newly built tanks were fitted with the AA heavy machine gun.

The tank carries 40 rounds for the main gun. 4 rounds are placed in the turret, and the rest are stored in the back of the fighting compartment and in the front of the hull, to the right of the driver. It carries 2,500 rounds for the coaxial machine gun. All of the vehicle&#x27;s armament is mounted in or on the round cast egg-shaped turret from the Ob&#x27;yekt 140 prototype main battle tank, mounted over the third pair of road wheels.

The T-62 was armed with the world&#x27;s first smoothbore tank gun, giving it considerably greater muzzle velocity than the Western 90 mm and 105 mm tank guns of its time. It can fire BM-3 APFSDS-T, BK-4, BK-4M HEAT and OF-18 Frag-HE rounds. The 115 mm gun introduced the first successful APFSDS ammunition, albeit with a steel penetrator. A smoothbore gun allowed a significantly better performance (from 10% to 20%) over HEAT ammunition, which was considered the main ammunition type for fighting enemy armour at medium and long ranges.

The gun can be elevated or depressed between −6° and +16°. It is reloaded manually and gets automatically reset to +3.5° of elevation after it is fired if the stabiliser is enabled. Empty cartridges are automatically ejected outside the vehicle through a small hatch in the rear of the turret. The gun has a range of effective fire of about 4 km during day conditions and 800 m at night (with the use of night vision equipment). This tank was fitted with a Meteor two-axis stabiliser, which allows the T-62 to aim and fire while moving. Tests of the Meteor conducted by the US army gave the T-62 a first hit probability of 70% for a moving target at 1000 meters with the tank moving up to 20 km/per hour. This gave the tank a good advantage in dynamic battlefields and breakthrough operations, especially in Central Europe where most of tank battles would take place under the 1500 meters range.

=== Mobility ===
The T-62 uses torsion bar suspension. It has five pairs of rubber-tired road wheels, a drive sprocket at the rear and an idler at the front on each side, with no return rollers. The first and last road wheels each have a hydraulic shock absorber. The tank is powered by the V-55 12-cylinder 4-stroke one-chamber 38.88-litre water-cooled diesel engine developing 581 hp (433 kW) at 2,000 rpm. This is the same engine as the one used in the T-55.

Because the T-62 weighs more than the T-55, it is less manoeuvrable. Like the T-55, the T-62 has three external diesel fuel tanks on the right fender and a single auxiliary oil tank on the left fender. The tank carries 960 litres of fuel in its internal and external fuel tanks. Two optional 200-litre drum-type fuel tanks can be fitted on the rear of the vehicle for an increased operational range.

=== Armour ===

The T-62 has 5% thicker armour on the front of the hull (102 mm at 60°) and 15% thicker armour on the front of the turret (242 mm) than the T-54/T-55. The turret armour is 153 mm thick on the sides, 97 mm thick on the rear and 40 mm thick on the roof. The hull armour is 79 mm thick on the upper sides, 46 mm thick at 0° on the rear and 20 mm thick on the bottom. Although the armour on the front of the hull is thicker than in the T-55, the lower side armour (15 mm) and the roof armour (31 mm) are actually thinner.

=== Equipment ===

One of the many similarities between the T-54/T-55 and T-62 tanks is their ability to create a smoke screen by injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust system. Like the T-54 and T-55, the T-62 has an unditching beam mounted at the rear of the hull. The tank can be fitted with a thin snorkel for operational usage and a large diameter snorkel for training. The thin snorkel can be disassembled and carried in the back of the turret when not used.

The commander&#x27;s cupola is located on the left of the top of the turret. The loader has a single-piece hatch located on the right side of the turret and further back than the commander&#x27;s cupola. The loader&#x27;s hatch has a periscope vision block that can be used to view the areas in front of and behind the vehicle. The commander&#x27;s cupola has four periscopes, two are located in the hatch cover while the other two are located in the forward part of the cupola.

The driver has a single piece hatch located on the left front of the vehicle, directly in front of the left side of the turret. The tank uses the same sights and vision devices as the T-55 except for the gunner, who received a new TSh-2B-41 sight which has x4 or x7 magnification. It is mounted coaxially with an optic rangefinder.

The gunner has two periscope vision blocks, one of which is used in conjunction with the main searchlight mounted coaxially on the right side of the main armament. There are two other smaller searchlights. One of these is used by the commander and is mounted on his cupola. The tank has two headlights on the right front of the vehicle, one of which is infrared while the other one is white.

Curved handrails around the turret allow easier entry for the commander, the gunner, and the loader. They also help the infantry to mount and dismount the tank while performing a tank desant. The tank has a box-shaped radiation detector/actuator mounted on the right-hand side of the turret, behind the compressed air tanks.

While the T-62 did not feature an automatic loader (as would become characteristic of later Soviet tanks), it had a unique &quot;ejection port&quot; built into the back of the turret, which would open as the main gun recoiled, ejecting spent shell casings outside. This was considered advantageous since the spent casings would otherwise clutter the floor of the tank and fill the interior with noxious burnt-propellant fumes. There is a blower mounted in the rear of the turret, to the left of the spent cartridge ejection port.

=== Limitations ===
The T-62 shares some of the T-55&#x27;s limitations: a cramped crew compartment, limited depression of the main gun and vulnerable fuel and ammunition storage areas. Opening the ejection port under NBC (nuclear, biological, or chemical) conditions would potentially expose the crew to contamination.

Early models of the T-62 only filtered nuclear fallout, leaving the crew exposed to chemical or biological contaminants, as the air was not passed through a chemical filter. Late production models of the T-62 were fitted with a chemical filter.

Each time the gun is fired, the tube must go into detent for cartridge ejection; though the system can be deactivated making this unnecessary or in case of facing an NBC environment. The T-62 maximum average rate of fire is limited to 8 rounds per minute, which falls behind the capabilities of Western 105 mm gun equipped tanks.

It takes 20 seconds for the T-62&#x27;s turret to rotate through a full 360°, which is 5 seconds longer than the time needed by the US M60A1 Patton tank.

The turret also cannot be traversed with the driver&#x27;s hatch open. Although the tank commander may override the gunner and traverse the turret, he cannot fire the main gun from his position.

The US Army considered the T-62&#x27;s gun more accurate than that of the M60A1 within 1500 meters, but less accurate at greater ranges.

To fire the 12.7 mm antiaircraft heavy machine gun, the loader must be partially exposed, making him vulnerable to suppressive fire, and he must leave his main gun loading duties unattended.

Due to their vulnerability to fire, the auxiliary fuel drums were usually removed prior to combat, decreasing the operational range substantially.

The T-62K command tank land navigation system requires a 15 minute warm-up, during which the vehicle cannot move without damaging the gyroscopic compass.

The T-62 underperformed in export markets relative to the T-54/T-55 series. Namely due to the much more expensive export price of the T-62, being $300,000 to Egypt in 1972, whereas the T-55 cost only $200,000, alongside Egypt already having a logistics line for T-54/55 upkeep. This also caused Warsaw Pact nations to be swayed away from the purchase of the T-62 as they felt that the logistical and unit costs outweighed the benefits it could provide.

Third, the T-62 was, according to Perrett, almost immediately surpassed on its introduction by the new Western MBTs, the Chieftain and M60. Finally, the T-62 could not keep up with the new Soviet BMP-1 – the principal infantry fighting vehicle that the T-62 was supposed to accompany. All of these factors combined to ensure that long-term investment in the T-62 was not viable and a new Soviet MBT had to be developed.

== Production history ==
In July 1961, Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv, Ukraine and Omsk Factory No. 183 replaced part of their T-55 production with the T-62. The original plans were that the T-62 would be produced until Morozov&#x27;s Ob&#x27;yekt 432 tank was developed. T-62 production was maintained at Uralvagonzavod until 1973 when it was replaced on the production lines by the T-72. Until the end of production 20,000 T-62 tanks were produced by Uralvagonzavod. Production in the Soviet Union was stopped in 1975.

North Korea produced the T-62 under licence until the 1980s. In the early 1990s, the North Korean Second Machine Industry Bureau designed a lighter copy of the T-62 which is mass-produced and is known locally as the Ch&#x27;ŏnma-ho I (Ga).

== Service history ==


=== Soviet Union ===

2023-24
Number 206

The T-62 entered service with the Soviet Army in July 1961. Because of the firepower of the new 115 mm gun, it was considered to be a formidable tank for the time, despite its drawbacks. Along with the T-55, the T-62 was one of the most common tanks in the Soviet inventory. The two tanks together once comprised approximately 85% of the Soviet army&#x27;s tanks.
Later in the 1970s, the T-62 was rendered obsolete and was put into reserve service. The T-72 and T-80 later succeeded it.

==== Sino-Soviet border conflict ====
The T-62 saw combat for the first time during the 1969 Sino–Soviet border conflict during which one was disabled and captured by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. The T-62 (No. 545) was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired from a Type-56 (Chinese copy of RPG-2) RPG launcher on the morning of 15 March 1969 during a PLA counterattack. The RPG penetrated the left side of the hull, killing the driver. This tank was later studied and the information gathered from those studies was used for the development of the Type 69 main battle tank.

==== Soviet–Afghan War ====
During the Soviet–Afghan War, the T-62 was a primary tank used by the Soviet army. The Soviets used tanks in several ways, with the use of many in fire support bases, while others were employed for convoy protection or as infantry support. Towards the end of the war T-62Ms, using the BDD appliqué armour, appeared in large numbers. According to US sources, nearly 325 T-62s fell victim to Mujahideen attacks, especially from anti-tank mines and RPGs, although this number is directly contradicted by Soviet sources, which show far fewer losses. Others fell into the hands of the Afghan Mujahideen after they were left behind by withdrawing Soviet forces.

The USSR officially confirmed the loss of 147 T-62 and T-55 tanks during the war.

=== Russia ===
The T-62 and T-55 are now mostly used by Russian reserve units for a possible secondary mobilization while some are kept in storage. The active duty and primary mobilization units mainly use the T-80, T-72 and T-64, with a smaller number of T-90 tanks in service in active units. They were retired from active combat service after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War to be put in storage to be reactivated in case of war. During the Vostok 2018 military exercise, multiple T-62M and T-62MVs were reactivated from storage and mobilised, in an effort to assess how quickly Russian forces could be readied for a major conflict.

==== War in Chechnya ====
The Russian army and the Russian MVD forces used both T-62s and T-62Ms in combat in Chechnya.

During the second war the 160th Guards Tank Regiment (5th Guards Tank Division, Siberian Military District) and the 93rd MVD Mechanized Tank Regiment each had 69 T-62 tanks. Some T-62s were used on train platforms. Up to 380 Russian tanks were used in 1999–2000, including about 150 T-62s.

==== 2008 South Ossetia war ====
T-62s of the Russian Ground Forces were deployed in the Russo-Georgian war. In one case a T-62M belonging to the Russian army was destroyed by a Georgian RPG in the streets of Tskhinvali. In this instance the rocket penetrated the turret of the T-62M, killing the driver and gunner. Russian MVD also used T-62s.

==== Russo-Ukrainian war ====

Since May 2022, Russia has deployed T-62 tanks in Ukraine. Ukrainian intelligence reported that Russia had reactivated these tanks from storage depots in Siberia. By late May, T-62Ms and T-62MVs were transported by train to Ukraine, with additional reports indicating more T-62 tanks being sent towards Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih on June 5. In early June, T-62 tanks equipped with improvised slat armor, similar to that used on more modern Russian T-72 and T-80 tanks, were identified in Kherson Oblast.

Later in June, the Head of North Ossetia–Alania, Sergey Menyaylo, announced that volunteers in the Alania Battalion had received a tank unit equipped with T-62 tanks. According to the Russian website Voennoe Obozrenie, these tanks were primarily intended to support infantry units and were not expected to engage Ukrainian tanks directly.

In Kherson, Russian forces utilized T-62 tanks to provide artillery support. In October 2022, during a visit at the 103rd Armor Repair Plant, State Duma member Andrey Gurulyov declared that the Russian military would receive 800 T-62s in the following three years. These tanks would be refurbished and possibly upgraded before being sent to Ukraine.

In February 2023, a Ukrainian mechanic stated that his shop was converting at least one captured T-62 into an armored recovery vehicle, remarking that &quot;this old tank is no good for war.&quot; Also, in late February 2023, a T-62 was identified with its original TSh-2B-41 or TShSM-41U sight replaced by a 1PN96MT-02 analogue thermal gunner&#x27;s sight.

Ukraine is converting some T-62s into infantry fighting vehicles by fitting BMP-2 turrets to the hulls, armed with a 30mm 2A42 autocannon.

On September 10, 2023, it was reported that Ukraine&#x27;s 128th Mountain Assault Brigade converted a captured T-62 tank into a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) filled with 1.5 tons of explosives and drove it towards Russian positions in the Zaporizhzhia region. The tank hit a mine and exploded before it could reach the enemy positions.

As of February 2025, Russia is visually confirmed to have suffered 248 T-62 losses (5 T-62 Obr. 1967, 2 T-62 Obr. 1972, 128 T-62M, 36 T-62M Obr. 2022, 35 T-62MV, 9 T-62MV Obr. 2022 and 33 Unknown T-62).

=== Foreign service ===
==== Angola ====
The People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) began ordering T-62s from the Soviet Union in 1980 and received them by late 1985. Most of the tanks were delivered in the wake of Operation Askari, which saw multiple T-54s and T-55s knocked out by South African expeditionary forces using light anti-tank weapons and highly mobile Eland-90 and Ratel-90 armoured cars. As a result of the destruction and capture of Angolan T-54/55s during Operation Askari, the Soviet military mission in Angola committed to drastically accelerate the transfer of more sophisticated weaponry to FAPLA, including T-62s. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, FAPLA had received 175 second-hand T-62s from Soviet reserve stocks by the end of 1985. South African intelligence reported that no more than 30 were in active service between late 1985 and 1986, possibly because most of the FAPLA crews were still being trained.

FAPLA deployed its T-62s for the first time during Operation Second Congress, a failed 1986 offensive against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) near Mavinga. A number of T-62s were lost during the 1986 campaign, with some being abandoned on the battlefield and others destroyed by UNITA insurgents or South African air strikes. FAPLA T-62s were present during the initial phase of Operation Saluting October, a similar offensive undertaken the following year, but did not see action in the ensuing 1987-88 Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. FAPLA ordered another 135 T-62s from the Soviet Union to replace tank losses in 1987. Another 24 were purchased from Bulgaria and taken into service by the new Angolan Armed Forces in 1993.

The only other Warsaw Pact member to operate T-62s on a mass scale was Bulgaria which bought 250 T-62s, which were delivered between 1970 and 1974. After the war in Afghanistan, Bulgaria received a number of T-62s from the Soviet Union in the 1980s. These were modified, but due to several problems were quickly withdrawn from service; some were sold to Angola and Yemen. Many were converted into TV-62 and TV-62M armoured recovery vehicles, their turrets being scrapped. The TV-62M is the standard armoured recovery vehicle of the Bulgarian Army.

==== Other Warsaw Pact members ====
Both Poland and Czechoslovakia evaluated the vehicle but refused it because of the high price and low update value compared to the T-55.

==== Israel ====
Before 1973, Israeli intelligence confirmed T-62 tanks had arrived in Egypt. In response, Israeli commandos raided Egyptian positions in order to capture the tanks and analyze them. During the Yom Kippur war, the T-62 was an effective adversary for Israeli Patton and Centurion main battle tanks armed with 105 mm tank guns. The T-62 had an advantage in its better night-fighting capability, but Syrian losses were heavy.

The Israelis captured hundreds of these tanks from the Syrians in 1973, and put some of them into service as the Tiran-3. About 120 Tiran-3 were modernised and received the designation Tiran-6. Only a small number were converted because the new US-made M60 main battle tanks started arriving in Israel.

A small tank brigade consisting of two enlarged tank regiments, each equipped with 46 Tiran-6 tanks, was formed. The Tiran-6 is used by reserve units. The Israelis have sold the rest to assorted countries.

Israel sent a number of captured T-62 tanks to the U.S. Army and Germany for examination purposes.

==== Iraq ====
In 1974, the Iraqi Army acquired 100 T-62s and 600 more in 1976, which were delivered through to 1979. In 1982 a further 2,150 were ordered, which were delivered through to 1989. These tanks saw service in the Iraqi–Kurdish conflict from 1974 to 1991.

In the Iran–Iraq War, Iraqi T-62s performed well against opposing Iranian tanks, such as M47s, M48s, M60A1s and Chieftains. In Operation Nasr, the biggest tank battle of the war, Iran lost 214 Chieftain and M60A1 tanks, while Iraq lost 45 T-62s. The remaining Iranian armour turned about and withdrew. Approximately 200 T-62s were lost in the entire war.

==== Libya ====

Libyan T-62s were first deployed against the Chadian National Armed Forces (FANT) in the Aouzou Strip around September 1986. The tanks also formed an integral part of a brigade-sized, combined arms task force ordered to drive Chadian troops loyal to the Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) from the Tibesti Mountains the following December. During the Toyota War, a few T-62s were destroyed at medium range by MILAN anti-tank missiles mounted on Chadian technicals. According to French after-action reports released in March 1988, several were also knocked out by FANT Panhard AML-90 armoured cars with flank or rear shots.

==== Cuba ====
The first T-62s arrived in Cuba in 1976. Currently approximately 400 are in service with the Cuban armed forces and about 100 are in storage. They are modernised to the T-62M standard with additional armour, laser equipment and fire control systems.

A Cuban armoured brigade with T-62s saw action against the Somali National Army during the Ogaden War in Ethiopia. Cuban T-62s were deployed to Angola during Havana&#x27;s lengthy intervention in that country. Along with T-55s and T-54Bs, they were initially utilitised for defending strategic installations, such as Matala, the site of an important Angolan hydroelectric plant manned by Soviet engineers. The more ubiquitous T-55 was favoured for combat duty, and during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale only a single battalion of Cuban T-62s was situated near the fighting.

Circumstances changed in March 1988, when Cuba began marshalling a combined arms division to carry out a flanking manoeuvre towards the South-West African (Namibian) border. It included a brigade with at least 40 T-62s. The Cuban tanks clashed with defending South African armoured units at Cuamato and again at Calueque without sustaining any known losses.

==== Gulf War ====

Iraqi-operated T-62s were badly outperformed by the American M1 Abrams, M2/M3 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and the British Challenger 1 tanks in the 1990–1991 Gulf War. The lack of high powered optics, thermal sights and ballistic computers of Iraqi tanks compared to their adversaries made the T-62 and other Iraqi armoured fighting vehicles extremely vulnerable and unable to retaliate against Coalition vehicles. The Iraqi 3rd Armoured Division alone lost about a hundred T-62 tanks, while no Abrams or Challengers were lost to enemy fire.

****** (Ob&#x27;yekt 166M) (1983) – Extensive modernization of the T-62 with protection and mobility improvements and the &quot;Volna&quot; fire control system. It is fitted with a BDD appliqué armour package, an additional belly armour plate for anti-mine protection, 10 mm thick reinforced rubber side skirts and 10 mm thick anti-neutron liner. The BDD appliqué armour package brings the frontal armour to nearly equivalent to the early T-64A and T-72 Ural and consists of an appliqué plate on the glacis and two horseshoe shaped blocks fitted to the front of the turret. This armour should be proof against all 84mm and 90mm tank gun rounds at all ranges, 105mm APDS and HEAT, 84mm and 106mm recoilless rifle HEAT rounds and many 1st generation anti-tank missiles as well as the M72A3 LAW and RPG-7. The handrails around the turret have been removed to make space for the BDD appliqué armour. Fastenings for four spare track chain links have been added on the side of the turret. The tank is fitted with RhKM tracks from the T-72 main battle tank and two additional shock absorbers on the first pair of road wheels. The &quot;Volna&quot; fire control system was improved by fitting the KTD-2 (or KTD-1) laser rangefinder in an armoured box over the main armament. There is a new TShSM-41U gunner&#x27;s sight, new commander&#x27;s sight, &quot;Meteor-M1&quot; stabiliser, BV-62 ballistic computer and 9K116-2 &quot;Sheksna&quot; (NATO: AT-10 Stabber) guided missile unit with 1K13-BOM sight (it is both a night sight and ATGM launcher sight but cannot be used for both functions simultaneously) which allows the tank to fire 9M117 Bastion ATGMs through its gun tube. The tank was fitted with a gun thermal sleeve, new radios, the R-173 radio set instead of R-123M and a new V-55U diesel engine developing 620 hp (462 kW). The ammunition load was increased by two rounds. Some are fitted with two clusters of four smoke grenade launchers each on the right rear of the turret. US intelligence saw T-62M tanks for the first time during the Soviet–Afghan War and they gave it the designation T-62E. There are a number of sub-variants of the T-62M, depending on how much of the modernization package the vehicle has installed.

******* T-62MK (Ob&#x27;yekt 166MK) (K stands for &quot;komandirskaya&quot; [&quot;command&quot;]) – T-62M command variant. It does not have ATGM capability but has TNA-2 navigation aids, additional R-112 and R-113 radio sets and an AB-1 auxiliary engine to power the additional radios. The tank has a lower ammunition load for both the main gun and the coaxial general-purpose machine gun.
******** T-62MK-1 (Ob&#x27;yekt 166MK-1) – T-62MK fitted with the V-46–5M diesel engine.
******* T-62MV (Ob&#x27;yekt 166MV) (1985) (V stands for &quot;vzryvnoi&quot; – [&quot;explosive&quot;]) – Fitted with &quot;Kontakt-1&quot; explosive reactive armour (ERA) on the sides of the hull, the glacis plate, and in the front of the turret (where it replaces the BDD appliqué armour).
******** T-62MV-1 (Ob&#x27;yekt 166MV-1) – T-62MV fitted with the V-46–5M diesel engine.

********* T-62M1V-1 (Ob&#x27;yekt 166M1V-1) – T-62M1V fitted with a V-46–5M diesel engine.
*** T-62 fitted with a box on the rear of the turret containing anti-aircraft missiles.
*** T-62 fitted with the ZET-1 (ZET stands for &quot;Zaschtschita Ekrannaja Tankowaja&quot;) vehicle protection system. The system was developed in 1964 and was specially designed to protect the tank&#x27;s front and sides up to an angle of 25° against shaped-charge projectiles with of a maximum caliber of 115 mm. It consisted of a stretchable screen with net structure centered on the vehicle&#x27;s main armament and lateral flipper-type sideskirts. It was intended for T-54, T-55 and T-62 tanks. The diameter of the screens was different for each tank type. The individual screen sections could be replaced in two minutes. While it was successful in wide open spaces, it was an impractical in wooded areas. Because of that the development was not heavily used, although the flipper-type sideskirts were later used in the initial T-72 models.
*** T-62 experimentally fitted with a &quot;Zhelud&quot; autoloader.
*** T-62/122 – T-62 based combat engineering vehicle rearmed with 122 mm howitzer.
*** T-62/160 – T-62 based combat engineer vehicle fitted with BTU and armed with a shortened 160 mm mortar.
*** T-67 – T-62 armed with a 125 mm tank gun and fitted with a drive train from the T-72 main battle tank.
*** – T-62 converted into a flamethrower tank. The flamethrower has an effective range of 100 meters and is mounted coaxially with the 115 mm gun.
*** (Ob&#x27;yekt 150) – T-62 converted into a tank destroyer (&quot;istrebitel&#x27; tankov&quot;). It was developed between 1957 and 1962. It utilised the chassis and the hull of the T-62 tank and was fitted with a new low &#x27;flattened dome&#x27; turret with a stabilised 2K8 ATGM system instead of the tank gun. The IT-1 was the only one of several &quot;rocket tank&quot; (&#x27;raketniy tank&#x27;) designs that actually entered service. It could launch radio-guided semi-automatic PTUR 3M7 &quot;Drakon&quot; ATGMs with a range between 300 m and 3,300 m. It carried 15 PTUR 3M7 &quot;Drakon&quot; ATGMs on board (3 in reserve and 12 in the autoloader). The ATGM was launched from an arm rising through the roof of the turret. The secondary armament consisted of a 7.62 mm PKT general-purpose machine gun for which it carried 2,000 rounds. The turret was fitted with T2-PD and UPN-S day/night sights. About 60 IT-1 tank destroyers were built between 1968 and 1970 by various companies including 20 built by the Uralvagonzavod factory in 1970. Only two battalions operated them, one with artillery personnel and one with tank personnel, with one battalion in Belarus MD and the other one in the Carpathian MD. The units were disbanded after the withdrawal of the IT-1 and all the vehicles were converted to armoured recovery vehicles (ARVs).
**** (T after IT-1 stands for &quot;tyagach&quot; [&quot;tractor&quot;]) – After the withdrawal of the IT-1 from front-line service many of the vehicles were partially converted to ARVs. The only differences from the standard IT-1 was that the turret was fixed in position after all the ATGM gear was removed. They were not very successful and were soon converted into the BTS-4V armoured recovery vehicles.
*** (BTS stands for &quot;bronirovannij tyagach, srednij&quot; [&quot;medium armoured tractor&quot;]) – Conversion of T-62 main battle tanks and IT-1 tank destroyers into a turretless ARV. They are similar to the much more common T-54 -based BTS-4. The vehicle was fitted with a stowage basket, a hoist and a small folding crane with a capacity of 3 tonnes, a winch, and a snorkel. It is also known as BTS-4U.
**** BTS-4V1 – Conversion of approximatively 35 pre-production T-62 main battle tanks into ARVs.
*** BTS-4V2 – Partial conversion of 20 T-62 main battle tanks damaged by fire into an armoured recovery vehicle. The turret was replaced by a dome-shaped fixed superstructure. There is a single hatch on top of the superstructure fitted with a 12.7 mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun. It was limited to basic towing operations and most were disposed of by giving them away as foreign aid. They were also known as BTS-4VZ.
*** Impuls-2M – Decommissioned T-62 tank converted into a fire fighting vehicle fitted with a 50-round launch system for flame-retarding projectiles on a rotatable mount in the turret ring and a dozer blade on the front.

===Algeria===
* BMPT-62 (sometimes called Algerian Terminator in reference to the BMPT Terminator) – A fire support vehicle developed from leftover T-62 tanks and Berezhok turrets. The vehicle was presented at the 60th anniversary parade of Algeria’s independence.

=== Bulgaria ===

* TV-62 – T-62 tank converted into an armoured recovery vehicle.
* T-62 modification.
* TV-62M – T-62M tank converted into an armoured recovery vehicle. This vehicle is composed of a T-62M hull with a modified T-55 or T-55A turret which was cut in half; the upper part was bolted onto the hull in the 6 o&#x27;clock position. There is a large winch and a snorkel mounted on the rear of the hull.
* TP-62 – fire fighting vehicle, for the first time presented during the Hemus 2008 defense equipment trade show. Used in the putting out of the Vitosha 2012 fire.

=== Egypt ===

* T-62 modernization made by NORICUM. The modernization includes a replacement of the 115 mm tank gun with a 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun. The Egyptian Army evaluated the vehicle and incorporated its upgrades in its RO-115 Mark I modernization.
** : developed in the early 1980s. While retaining the Soviet 115 mm gun, more powerful ammunition allows engaging a target at greater range. Some main guns were replaced with the Royal Ordnance L7 105 mm gun as offered by the Austrian firm NORICUM. Other modifications included a British diesel engine developing 750 hp (559 kW), a two-plane stabiliser, ballistic computer, laser rangefinder in an armoured box over the main armament, a cluster of six smoke grenade launchers on the right side of the turret, a fire control system from BMP-3 IFV and additional armour including reactive armour. The upgrades resulted in an increase of weight to 43 tons.
** : Mid 1990s Egyptian refurbishment and modernization program. The tanks were fitted with a license-built German MTU engine developing 880 hp (656 kW). The tanks are armed with a license-built 105 mm M68 tank gun, an Italian fire control system with ballistics computer, infrared vision device, laser rangefinder, gun stabiliser, additional armour including reactive armour, armoured side skirts, modernised suspension and six smoke grenade launchers on each side of the turret. It has an upgraded NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) protection system. The T-62E Mark II carries two Egyptian-made two-round anti-tank missile launchers or two 2-round launchers for 80 mm D-3000 smoke rockets on an encroachment extension, or a box-type launcher holding two Sakr smoke missiles on each side of the turret. The upgrade did not change the weight of the tank, which remained at 45 tons.
** : T-62 tank upgrade developed in 2004. This upgrade arms the tank with the 120 mm M-393 tank gun developed by FSUE. The gun is 5.30 m long and weighs 2.6 tonnes. It can be elevated or depressed between −7° and +15°. The tank has a new license-built German MTU engine developing 890 hp (664 kW) and additional armour, including reactive armour and armoured side skirts. The upgrades resulted in a weight increase to 46.5 tons. This upgrade was completed by the end of 2008.

=== France ===
* T-62 modernization made by GIAT. The modernization includes a replacement of the 115 mm tank gun with a 120 mm smoothbore tank gun, the same as the one used in the AMX 40 prototype main battle tank. No orders were placed for this unit.

=== Israel ===

Israel captured a small number of Syrian T-62s and made limited adaptions for Israeli service, including US-made radio equipment. The Tiran 6 was not as extensively modified as the Tirans 4 and 5. It is reputed that some Tiran-6s were fitted with &quot;Blazer&quot; reactive armour tiles on the glacis and turret, but that remains to be proven by photographic evidence.

A large open stowage bin was fitted to the turret rear, where stowed gear could, unfortunately, obstruct the hatch for the automatic cartridge case ejection system, with a lidded bin on the right of the turret. These bins were similar to those fitted on Tirans 4 and 5. The original 115 mm gun was retained, making IDF dependent on captured ammunition.

The commander&#x27;s 12.7 mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun was replaced by an M1919 Browning 7.62mm machine gun, with a mount for a second Browning on the loader&#x27;s hatch. An M2 Browning 12.7mm machine gun could be mounted on the mantlet of the main gun as a ranging gun. Tiran 6 was apparently only deployed operationally during the 1982 Lebanon War and was withdrawn from service shortly afterwards as the arrival of further stocks of M60 and M60A1 from the US made it unnecessary to use the T-62.

=== North Korea ===
* Ch&#x27;ŏnma-ho I (Ga) – This is a lighter and thinner armoured copy of the T-62. Based on general trends and photography of armed forces parades, it is clear that North Korea has made considerable modifications to the basic Soviet and Chinese designs in its own production.
* Ch&#x27;ŏnma-ho II – designation for an imported T-62.
* Ch&#x27;ŏnma-ho III – A simple progressive upgrade of the Ch’onma-ho 2, with a thermal sleeve for the main gun and armoured track skirts added. It is possible, but considered unlikely, that lugs for ERA have been added since its introduction; if they are present, they would be most likely found on the glacis and turret sides. A night vision upgrade.
* Ch&#x27;ŏnma-ho IV – Greatly upgraded armour protection, including composite armour on the glacis and turret front, and appliqué or thickened armour elsewhere. Even the appliqué and/or thickened armour appears to be more advanced than earlier models, and does not appear to have gained a huge amount of weight. A ballistic computer was added to the fire control suite, and the fire control suite has been integrated into a complete system rather than being a patchwork of upgrades. Gun stabilization has been improved. Radios are improved, and the suspension beefed up. The new engine is a 750-horsepower model which can lay a thick, oily smoke screen by injecting diesel fuel into its exhaust. Lugs for ERA (similar to the Russian Kontakt-3 ERA) were added to turret sides, and lugs on the armoured track skirts and on the glacis. Lugs for a relatively small amount of ERA bricks on the turret front; the ERA on the turret front would only protect 40% of hits to the turret front. On side of the turret, clusters of four smoke grenade launchers; at the rear of the turret another cluster of four smoke grenade launchers, firing backwards instead of forward.
* Ch&#x27;ŏnma-ho V – Armour upgrades derived partially from the T-90S and T-72S, as well as a better ballistic computer and the addition of the aforementioned thermal imagers. Upgraded main gun – a copy of the 2A46 125 mm gun. Some sources also claim an autoloader was installed; however, this statement is questionable since the Pokpung&#x27;ho (another T-62-based tank with the 2A46 125 mm gun) was confirmed to have a manual loader. The fire control system was replaced with one matching the new main gun, and the spent shell ejection system was dispensed with. Used wider tracks.

=== Russia ===
*T-62M &quot;Obr. 2021&quot; – Upgraded T-62M. Kontakt-1 ERA bricks and slat armour were added to the sides. A more modern 1PN96MT-02 gunner&#x27;s sight replaced the older TPN-1 sights.
* T-62MV &quot;Obr. 2022&quot; – Upgraded T-62MV. Uses the 1PN96MT-02 gunner&#x27;s sight. Used in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Ukraine ===
* T-55AGM – Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization which can also be applied to T-62s.
* – Upgraded by Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau. It is fitted with the 5TDF 700 hp diesel engine, a 125 mm KBA-101 tank gun, new fire control equipment and enhanced armour protection. The combat weight is 39.5 tonnes. The crew still consists of 4 men because there is no automatic loader. The upgrade package is aimed at the export market.
Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau is offering three T-62 conversions:
* T-62 based heavy infantry fighting vehicle.
* T-62 based armoured recovery vehicle.
* T-62 based armoured bridge layer.
Ukrainian volunteers installed a BMP-2 turret onto a captured T-62M, armour plates and Explosive Reactive Armour were bolted on the hull and turret, the program is meant to create a Heavy Infantry Fighting Vehicle.

=== United States ===
* T-62 – This version is modified in a number of ways including the replacement of the original diesel engine with a Caterpillar diesel engine and fitting of US radios and antennae mounts. T-62 tanks modified in such a way were used by the US Army for opposing forces training.

<text>Peter Arthur Firmin (11 December 1928 – 1 July 2018) was an English artist and puppet maker. He was the founder of Smallfilms, along with Oliver Postgate. Between them they created a number of popular children&#x27;s TV programmes, &quot;The Saga of Noggin the Nog&quot;, &quot;Ivor the Engine&quot;, &quot;Clangers&quot;, &quot;Bagpuss&quot; and &quot;Pogles&#x27; Wood&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Harwich, Essex, in 1928, Peter Firmin trained at the Colchester School of Art in Colchester. After National Service in the Royal Navy, he attended Central School of Art and Design in London from 1949–1952. He worked in a stained glass studio, as an illustrator and as a lecturer.

It was while he was teaching at Central School of Art that Oliver Postgate came looking for, as Firmin put it: &quot;... someone to illustrate a television story – someone who was hard up and would do a lot of drawing for very little money&quot;. Postgate and Firmin went on to form Smallfilms.

==Career==
Firmin was best known as half of the Smallfilms production company, active from 1958 to the late 1980s. Most of Smallfilms&#x27; animation work was produced in a barn on Firmin&#x27;s land in Blean near Canterbury in Kent. Firmin made the sets, puppets and backdrops for the programmes, often also contributing to making sound and visual effects during filming.

In addition to his work with Oliver Postgate, Firmin made other puppets and children&#x27;s programmes. In 1959, with his wife Joan, he devised a programme of nursery rhymes for Associated-Rediffusion, called &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, which used live cardboard animation and puppets. It was presented by Rolf Harris and then by Wally Whyton.

In 1961, ITV commissioned another puppet. Ollie Beak was a little owl made of chicken feathers stuck into a crocheted body. He appeared on &quot;Smalltime&quot;, and was joined in 1962 by Fred Barker (a shaggy dog made for Postgate/Firmin 1961 production &quot;The Dog Watch&quot;) and in 1963 by Whiffles, an otter puppet, and Penelope, another owl.

With Ivan Owen, Firmin co-created the TV puppet Basil Brush in 1962. He made the first puppet for &quot;The Three Scampies&quot;, using a real fox brush, lending the correct name for a fox’s tail to the puppet character.

For the UK&#x27;s Decimal Day (15 February 1971), Muskit reappeared with Firmin and made a trip to the shops in a BBC TV schools&#x27; programme.

Firmin continued to work as an illustrator. He wrote and illustrated many books of Smallfilms characters, as well as children&#x27;s books of his own devising and books for adults including Vita Sackville-West&#x27;s poetry () and &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, Postgate&#x27;s autobiography ().

==Printmaker==
Firmin, having retired from TV production, produced engravings and linocuts.

==Noggin stamp==
In 1994, Firmin provided an illustration for a British postage stamp, SG1804, featuring characters from Noggin the Nog. It was one of a set featuring characters from British children&#x27;s literature. He produced further illustrations for the advertising campaign to publicise the stamps.

==Recognition==
He was awarded an honorary MA by the University of Kent on 17 July 1987 and an Honorary degree from the University of Essex in 2012. In 2011 Firmin was awarded the Freedom of the City of Canterbury in recognition of his &quot;outstanding work&quot;.

He received the BAFTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014.

Between 12 May and 29 July 2018, Firmin&#x27;s work was featured in the exhibition &quot;Clangers, Bagpuss &amp; Co&quot;, organised by the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull.

==Personal life==
Firmin was married to Joan, who knitted the Clangers from vibrant pink wool. They met at the Central School of Art and Design in London, where Joan was studying bookbinding. They were married in 1952 and lived in London until moving to Kent in 1959. They had six daughters: One, Emily, appeared in the opening sequence of &quot;Bagpuss&quot;.

The Firmins lived on the farm in Blean, Kent, where Smallfilms produced their programmes.

Firmin died on 1 July 2018 at his home in Kent after a short illness at the age of 89. All the new episodes of &quot;Clangers&quot; made after this date were dedicated to his memory - the epitaph &quot;In loving memory of Peter Firmin&quot; can be seen at the end of the credits of these episodes.

<text>The Sakya (, &#x27;pale earth&#x27;) school is one of four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the others being the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Gelug. It is one of the Red Hat Orders along with the Nyingma and Kagyu.

==Origins==

The name &quot;Sakya&quot; (&quot;pale earth&quot;) derives from the unique grey landscape of the Ponpori Hills in southern Tibet near Shigatse, where Sakya Monastery, the first monastery of this tradition, and the seat of the Sakya School was built by Khon Konchog Gyalpo (1034–1102) in 1073.

The Sakya tradition developed during the second period of translation of Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit into Tibetan in the late 11th century. It was founded by Drogmi, a famous scholar and translator who had studied at the Vikramashila directly under Naropa, Ratnākaraśānti, Vāgīśvarakīrti and other great panditas from India for twelve years.

Khon Konchog Gyalpo became Drogmi&#x27;s disciple on the advice of his elder brother.

The tradition was established by the &quot;Five Venerable Supreme Masters&quot; starting with the grandson of Khonchog Gyalpo, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, who became known as Sachen, or &quot;Great Sakyapa&quot;:

*Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092–1158) 
*Sonam Tsemo (1142–1182)
*Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen (1147–1216)
*Sakya Pandita (1182–1251)
*Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280)

Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364) was an important scholar and writer and one of Tibet&#x27;s most celebrated historians. Other notable scholars of the Sakya tradition are the so-called &quot;Six Ornaments of Tibet:&quot;

*Yaktuk Sangyey Pal
*Rongton (1367–1449) 
*Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo
*Zongpa Kunga Namgyel
*Gorampa (1429–1489)
*Sakya Chokden (1428–1507)

The leadership of the Sakya School is passed down through a hereditary system between the male members of the Sakya branch of the Khon family.

==Teachings==

Sachen, the first of the five supreme masters, inherited a wealth of tantric doctrines from numerous Tibetan translators or &quot;lotsawas&quot; who had visited India: most importantly Drokmi Lotsawa, Bari Lotsawa and Mal Lotsawa. From Drokmi comes the supreme teaching of Sakya, the system of Lamdre &quot;Path and its Fruit&quot; deriving from the mahasiddha Virūpa based upon the Hevajra Tantra. Mal Lotsawa introduced to Sakya the esoteric Vajrayogini lineage known as &quot;Naro Khachoma.&quot; From Bari Lotsawa came innumerable tantric practices, foremost of which was the cycle of practices known as the &quot;One Hundred Sadhanas&quot;. Other key transmissions that form part of the Sakya spiritual curriculum include the cycles of Vajrakilaya, Mahākāla and Guhyasamāja tantras.

The fourth Sakya patriarch, Sakya Pandita, was notable for his exceptional scholarship and composed many important and influential texts on sutra and tantra, including &quot;Means of Valid Cognition: A Treasury of Reasoning&quot; (), &quot;Clarifying the Sage&#x27;s Intent&quot; () and &quot;Discriminating the Three Vows&quot; ().

The main Dharma system of the Sakya school is the &quot;Path with its Result&quot; (), which is split into two main lineages, &quot;Explanation for the Assembly&quot; () and the &quot;Explanation for Close Disciples&quot; ().

The other major system of the Sakya school is the &quot;Naropa Explanation For Disciples&quot; ().

Another important series of teachings is based on verses of Günga Nyingpo (1092–1158) called &quot;separating from the four attachments&quot; which is the subject of commentaries by numerous Sakya masters like Drakpa Gyeltsen, Sakya Pandita, Ngorchen Günga Sangpo, and Gorampa Sönam Senggé. The verses are:If you cling to this life, then you are not a dharma practitioner. If you cling to existence, then you do not have renunciation. If you are attached to your own interests, then you do not have the mind of awakening. If you hold to a position, then you do not have the correct view.

==Subschools==
In due course, two subsects emerged from the main Sakya lineage,

*Ngor, founded in Tsang by Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo (1382–1457). The Ngor school is centered on Ngor Evam Choden monastery. It represents 85% of the Sakyapa school and most if not all the monasteries in India are Ngorpa, apart from Sakya Trizin&#x27;s monastery.
*Tshar, founded by Tsarchen Losal Gyamtso (1496 - 1560 or 1502–1556).

There were three &quot;mother&quot; monasteries of the Sakya school: Sakya Monastery, founded in 1073, Ngor Evam Choden, founded in 1429, and Phanyul Nalendra in Phanyul, north of Lhasa, founded in 1435 by Kuntchen Rongten. Nalendra became the home of the &#x27;whispered-lineage&#x27; of the Tsar school.

The Bodongpa tradition, founded by Bodong Panchen Chögle Namgyel [1376 1451], is considered by some scholars to be a sub-sect of the Sakya tradition.

==Feudal lordship over Tibet==
The Mongol conquest of Tibet began after the foundation of the Mongol Empire in the early 13th century. In 1264, the feudal reign over Tibet was given to Drogön Chögyal Phagpa by Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty. Sakya lamas, along with Sakya Imperial Preceptors and dpon-chens continued to serve as viceroys or administrators of Tibet on behalf of Yuan emperors for nearly 75 years after Phagpa’s death in 1280, until the Yuan dynasty was greatly weakened by the Red Turban Rebellion in the 1350s, a decade before the Ming dynasty founded by the Han people overthrew the Yuan dynasty.

The leaders of the Sakya regime were as follows.
* Drogön Chögyal Phagpa 1253-1280
* Dharmapala Raksita 1280-1282, d. 1287
* Jamyang Rinchen Gyaltsen 1286-1303
* Zangpo Pal 1306-1323
* Khatsun Namkha Lekpa Gyaltsen 1325-1341
* Jamyang Donyo Gyaltsen 1341-1344
* Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen 1344-1347
* Lotro Gyaltsen 1347-1365

==Sakya today==

The head of the Sakya school, known as Sakya Trizin (&quot;holder of the Sakya throne&quot;), is always drawn from the male line of the Khön family. The present Sakya Trizin, Gyana Vajra is the forty-third to hold that office. 41st Sakya Trizin is thought to be the reincarnation of two great Tibetan masters: a Nyingmapa lama known as Apong Terton (Orgyen Thrinley Lingpa), who is famous for his Red Tara cycle, and his grandfather, the 39th Kyabgon Sakya Trizin Dhagtshul Thrinley Rinchen (1871–1936).

Traditionally, hereditary succession has alternated between the two Sakya palaces, since Khon Könchok Gyelpo&#x27;s (1034–1102) reign. The Ducho sub-dynasty of Sakya survives split into two palaces, the Dolma Phodrang and Phuntsok Phodrang. Sakya Trizin is head of the Dolma Phodrang. Jigdal Dagchen Sakya (1929–2016) was the head of the Phuntsok Phodrang, and lived in Seattle, Washington, where he co-founded Sakya Monastery of Tibetan Buddhism with Dezhung Rinpoche III, and constructed the first Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in the United States. Dagchen Sakya&#x27;s father was the previous Sakya Trizin, Trichen Ngawang Thutop Wangchuk, throne holder of Sakya, and his mother Dechen Drolma. Dagchen Sakya was married to Dagmo Jamyang Kusho Sakya; they have five sons, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

==The Rimé movement==

Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet&#x27;s cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamgön Kongtrül compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul&#x27;s collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final.

<text>The Gelug (, also Geluk; &#x27;virtuous&#x27;) is the newest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), a Tibetan philosopher, tantric yogi and lama and further expanded and developed by his disciples (such as Khedrup Je, Gyaltsap Je, Dulzin Drakpa Gyaltsen, and Gendün Drubpa).

The Gelug school is alternatively known as Kadam (&quot;bKa’-gdams gsar-pa&quot;), since it sees itself as a continuation of the Kadam tradition of Atisha (c. 11th century). The school of New Kadam, or New Kadampa is an offshoot of the Gelug-tradition. Furthermore, it is also called the Ganden school, after the first monastery established by Tsongkhapa. The Ganden Tripa (&quot;Ganden Throne Holder&quot;) is the official head of the school, though its most influential political figure is the Dalai Lama (&quot;Ocean Teacher&quot;). Allying themselves with the Mongol Khans, the Gelug school emerged as the dominant Buddhist school in Tibet and Mongolia since the end of the 16th century (religiously and politically). Another alternative name for this tradition is the Yellow Hat school or sect.

Doctrinally, the Gelug school promotes a unique form of prasangika Madhyamaka based on the works of Tsongkhapa. According to John Powers, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s work &quot;contains a comprehensive view of Buddhist philosophy and practice that integrates sutra and tantra, analytical reasoning, and yogic meditation.&quot;

== Etymology ==

&quot;Ganden&quot; is the Tibetan rendition of the Sanskrit name &quot;Tushita&quot;, the Pure land associated with Maitreya Buddha. At first, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s school was called &quot;Ganden Choluk&quot; meaning &quot;the Spiritual Lineage of Ganden&quot;. By taking the first syllable of &#x27;Ganden&#x27; and the second of &#x27;Choluk&#x27;, this was abbreviated to &quot;Galuk&quot; and then modified to the more easily pronounced &quot;Gelug&quot;.

The Gelug school was also called the &quot;New Kadam&quot;, because it saw itself a revival of the Kadam school founded by Atisha.

== History ==
=== Tsongkhapa ===
The Gelug school was founded by Je Tsongkhapa, an eclectic Buddhist monk and yogi who traveled Tibet studying under Kadam, Sakya, Drikung Kagyu, Jonang and Nyingma teachers. These include the Sakya scholar Rendawa (1349–1412), the Drikung Thil scholar Chenga Chokyi Gyalpo, the Kadam mystic Lama Umapa, the Jonang master Bodong Chokley Namgyal and the Dzogchen master Drupchen Lekyi Dorje.

A great admirer of the Kadam school, Tsongkhapa merged the Kadam teachings of lojong (mind training) and lamrim (stages of the path) with the Vajrayana teachings of the Sakya, Kaygu and Jonang schools. He also emphasized monasticism and a strict adherence to vinaya (monastic discipline). He combined this with extensive and unique writings on madhyamaka, Buddhist epistemology, and Buddhist practice. Tsongkhapa&#x27;s numerous works on philosophy and tantric practice were widely influential and they marked a turning point in the history of Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.

Tsongkhapa and his disciples founded Ganden monastery in 1409, which was followed by the founding of Drepung (1416) and Sera (in 1419), which became the &quot;great three&quot; Gelug monasteries (and eventually they would become some of the largest monasteries in the world). According to Sam van Schaik these Gelug centers &quot;came to form a triumvirate of massive Gelug monasteries that would dominate the religious and political life of Central Tibet for centuries.&quot;

=== Early growth ===
After the death of Tsongkhapa in 1419 (who at the time was already famous and had attracted numerous disciples) the Gelug (a.k.a. Ganden) order grew extremely quickly through the efforts of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s disciples who founded numerous new monasteries and spread the doctrine throughout Tibet. The Gelug school developed a reputation for strict adherence to monastic discipline (vinaya) and rigorous scholarship as well as for tantric practice. According to Sam van Schaik, while Tsongkhapa himself did not work to establish a brand new school per se, it was Tsongkhapa&#x27;s disciples who took up the project of formally constructing a new school of Buddhism. Furthermore, van Schaik writes that &quot;much of the credit for defining and defending the new school must go to Tsongkhapa’s student Khedrup.&quot;

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s three principal disciples were Khedrup Gelek Palsang, Gyaltsap Darma Rinchen and Dülzin Drakpa Gyaltsen. Other important students of Tsongkhapa were Tokden Jampel Gyatso; Jamyang Chöjé and Jamchen Chöjé (the founders of Drepung and Sera monasteries, respectively); and Gendün Drup the First Dalai Lama.&quot; Several major monastic centers were founded in Tsang, including Tashi Lhünpo, Segyü, Gyümé and Gyütö college. By the end of the fifteenth century, the collected works of Tsongkhapa had been set on woodblock prints. His works would later be collected together with the works of Gyaltsap and Khedrup (who wrote numerous commentaries on Indian classics and on the works of Tsongkhapa) to become the main unique canonical collection of the Gelug school which is known as the “Father and Sons Collected Works” (&quot;jé yapsé ungbum&quot;).

According to Thupten Jinpa, by the end of the fifteenth century, the &quot;new Ganden tradition had spread through the entire Tibetan cultural area, with monasteries upholding the tradition located in western Tibet, in Tsang, in central and southern Tibet, and in Kham and Amdo in the east.&quot; John Powers also notes that during the following centuries the Gelug school &quot;continued to produce an impressive number of eminent scholars and tantric adepts.&quot;

By the end of the fifteenth century, Tsongkhapa had come to be seen as a second Buddha among in the Gelug tradition, and various hagiographies were written by his disciples (like Khedrup Je and Tokden Jampel Gyatso). These texts developed the great myths of the Buddha Tsongkhapa (including stories of his previous births and his various mystical visions) and helped established the new identity of the Gelug school as an authentic lineage (traced back to Manjushri). Meanwhile, among the other Tibetan schools, Tsongkhapa now came to be considered &quot;a force to be reckoned with, someone whose vision, ideas, and writings had to be understood in relation to their own cherished lineage and tradition.&quot;

This initial period of growth also saw scholastic debates and exchanges between the new Gelug tradition and the earlier sects like the Sakya school, who wrote critiques of Tsongkhapa&#x27;s philosophy, such as Rongton Shakya Gyaltsen (1367–1449) (and his work led to a response by Khedrup Je). This debate over Tsongkhapa&#x27;s madhyamaka interpretation was then taken up by a trio of Sakya school thinkers: Taktsang Lotsawa, Gorampa, and Shākya Chokden. Their critique would be countered by the works of numerous Gelug scholars, such as Lekpa Chöjor (a.k.a. Jamyang Galo, 1429–1503), the first Panchen Lama Lozang Chökyi Gyaltsen (1507–1662), Jetsun Chökyi Gyaltsen (1469–1544/46), Sera Jetsun Chökyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Delek Nyima and Jamyang Zhepa (1648–1751).

=== The Dalai Lamas and spread to Mongolia ===

In 1577 Sönam Gyatso, who was considered to be the third incarnation of Gendün Drup, formed an alliance with the then most powerful Mongol leader, Altan Khan. As a result, Sönam Gyatso was designated as the 3rd Dalai Lama. &quot;Dalai&quot; is a translation into Mongolian of the Tibetan name &quot;Gyatso&quot; (ocean). Gendün Drup and Gendun Gyatso were posthumously recognized as the 1st and 2nd Dalai Lamas respectively.

Sönam Gyatso was very active in proselytizing among the Mongols, and the Gelug tradition was to become the main religion of the Mongols in the ensuing centuries. Sönam Gyatso traveled to Mongolia, and supported the establishment of monasteries and the translation of Buddhist texts to Mongolian. He also worked against certain shamanistic practices such as animal sacrifice and blood sacrifices.

This turn of events provided the Gelug school with powerful patrons who were to propel them to political pre-eminence in Tibet. The Gelug-Mongol alliance was further strengthened as after Sonam Gyatso&#x27;s death, his incarnation was found to be Altan Khan&#x27;s great-grandson, who became the 4th Dalai Lama. The influence of the Gelug school on Mongolian Buddhism remains strong today. According to Thupten Jinpa &quot;an important legacy of this relationship has been the tradition of young Mongols studying at the great Geluk centers of learning in Amdo and central Tibet.&quot;

=== The rule of the Great Fifth ===
Following violent strife among the sects of Tibetan Buddhism, the Gelug school emerged as the dominant one, with the military help of the Mongol Güshri Khan who invaded Tibet in 1642 in order to defeat the king of Tsang. According to Tibetan historian Samten Karmay, Sonam Chophel (1595–1657), treasurer of the Ganden Palace, was the prime architect of the Gelug&#x27;s rise to political power. Later he received the title &quot;Desi&quot; [Wylie: &quot;sde-sris&quot;], meaning &quot;Regent&quot;, which he would earn through his efforts to establish Gelugpa power.

The 5th Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617–1682), was the first in his line to hold full political and spiritual power in Tibet. He established a formal theocratic system of government, opened diplomatic relations with Qing dynasty China, built the Potala Palace in Lhasa, institutionalized the Tibetan state Nechung Oracle, and spurred a major renaissance in art and book printing. From the period of the 5th Dalai Lama in the 17th century, the Dalai Lamas held political control over central Tibet. The core leadership of this government was also referred to as the Ganden Phodrang. According to Thupten Jinpa, the 5th Dalai Lama&#x27;s rule &quot;would bring Tibet into a semblance of political unity for the first time since the collapse of the Tibetan empire some seven hundred years earlier.&quot;

The Fifth Dalai Lama was a prolific author and scholar. According to Jinpa &quot;the Fifth Dalai Lama was personally an ecumenist who revered Tibet’s other major Buddhist traditions, especially the Nyingma.&quot; In this he was influenced by his teacher Paljor Lhundrup who was a Gelug monk and master of the Nyingma Great Perfection (Dzogchen) tradition. The &quot;Great Fifth&quot; wrote numerous works and revealed a cycle of Dzogchen teachings. One of his students (and political successor as regent), Desi Sangye Gyatso was also known as a great scholar who wrote various works on topics like Tibetan medicine, astrology, biography and calligraphy. He is the author of the important Tibetan medical text, &quot;The Mirror of Beryl,&quot; commissioned a set of medical paintings and wrote a biography of the Fifth Dalai Lama.

During the rule of the Fifth Dalai Lama that his teacher Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen received the title &quot;Panchen Bogd&quot; from Altan Khan and the Dalai Lama in 1645. This is the beginning of the Panchen Lama tulku line, who traditionally rules Shigatse and the Tsang region from his base at Tashilhunpo Monastery. The institutions of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama each participate in the process of recognizing each other&#x27;s reincarnations. Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen was a prolific scholar and a great yogi who is particularly known for his writings on Gelug Mahamudra (mainly his root text &quot;Highway of the Conquerors&quot; and its auto-commentary &quot;Lamp re-illuminating Mahamudra&quot;).
The Fifth Dalai Lama is also known for having recognized Zanabazar (1635–1723) as the first official Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the spiritual leader (&quot;Bogd Gegeen&quot;) of the Mongolian Gelug tradition. Zanabazar was a great Mongolian polymath who excelled in painting, sculpture, poetry, scholarship and languages. He is credited with having launched a renaissance of Mongolian culture in the seventeenth century, with having created the Soyombo script and with widely promoting Buddhism among the Mongols. Zanabazar also oversaw the construction of numerous major Gelug monasteries in Mongolia, such as Shankh Monastery, Tövkhön Monastery and Erdene Zuu Monastery.

The rule of the 5th Dalai Lama also oversaw the repression of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism who were political enemies of the Gelug school and had supported the Tsang dynasty. After the war, many Kagyu and Jonang monasteries were forcefully converted to Gelug monasteries. The writings of the Jonang school as well any literature from the Sakya masters who had attacked Tsongkhapa were also banned and their woodblock prints were locked away. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s attitude towards Nyingma was different, and he supported the collection and preservation of Nyingma texts, as well as personally patronizing the Mindroling monastery and their leaders Terdag Lingpa and Lochen Dharmashri.

=== 17 and 18th centuries ===
The Sixth Dalai Lama (1683–1706) was an unconventional figure who liked to live as a layperson, refused monastic vows, drank alcohol, slept with women and write love poems and erotic poems. His verses are an important part of Tibetan poetry. His successor, the 7th Dalai Lama, was also a noted poet, but he wrote mainly on Buddhist and spiritual themes. The 7th Dalai Lama Kelzang Gyatso was a highly learned Buddhist scholar and wrote hundreds of titles on various Buddhist topics. During the time of the 7th, Tibet also became a protectorate of the Qing Empire under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722).

The 8th, 9th, 10th. 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas all died young and were not significant figures. Tibet was ruled by a series of regents during this period and experienced much political instability.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, Gelug figures continued to produce new scholastic works. The development of the &quot;tenets&quot; (Tib. &quot;grub mtha&quot;&#x27;, Skt. &quot;siddhanta&quot;) genre (a form of doxography) became a particularly important element of Gelug education and scholarship. Perhaps the most influential Gelug doxographer was the great scholar Jamyang Shéba (1648– 1721), who wrote &quot;Roar of the Five-Faced [Lion],&quot; a series of verses on tenets&quot;,&quot; and a huge commentary to this root text (around 530 folios), called &quot;Great Exposition on Tenets&quot;. According to Daniel Cozort, Jamyang&#x27;s works &quot;are the most comprehensive of the tenets texts&quot; (in Tibetan Buddhism). His reincarnation, Gönchok Jikmé Ongpo (1728–1791), is also known for his shorter tenets text called &quot;Precious Garland of Tenets&quot; as well as other works on the bodhisattva path.

Other key Gelug scholars of this period include Changkya Rölpé Dorjé (1717–1786), who wrote &quot;Presentation of Tenets&quot;, and Ngawang Belden (b. 1797), who wrote a major commentary on Jamyang’s &quot;Great Exposition&quot;.

Changkya Rölpé Dorjé is also known for his knowledge of languages and translation work and for being the main teacher in the Qing court of the Qianlong Emperor. Changkya oversaw the translation of the Tibetan Buddhist canon into Mongolian and Manchu, compiled a collection of the canon in four languages (Chinese, Manchurian, Mongolian and Tibetan) and also supervised the translation of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra into Tibetan.

During the 18th century, Thuken Losang Chökyi Nyima (1737–1802), a student of Changkya, took the tenets genre one step further with his &quot;Crystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems.&quot; According to Roger R. Jackson, this text is &quot;arguably the widest-ranging account of religious philosophies ever written in pre-modern Tibet.&quot; This work of comparative philosophy and comparative religion discusses all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese Buddhism and Chinese religions as well as Indian, Mongolian and Khotanese religious systems.

=== The 19th century ===

The 19th century saw the great figure of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781–1851) who was an influential Gelug monk, poet and Dzogchen yogi who is particularly known for his non-sectarian study of various Tibetan Buddhist traditions, especially the Gelug and Nyingma traditions. His writings on non-sectarianism prefigure the rise of the Rime movement by about three decades. His autobiography and other works integrate the teachings of the Gelug tradition with that of the Nyingma school. Another Gelug master who was associated with non-sectarian activity was Minyak Kunzang Sonam (1823–1905). He was a Dzogchen practitioner and one of the four great Dharma heirs of the Nyingma master Patrul Rinpoche.

During the era of the 13th Dalai Lama (1876–1933) Tibet reclaimed its independence from China and went through some reforms and modernization activities. The 13th focused on centralizing and modernizing the Tibetan state through developing a modern tax system, military, police and administration. These changes brought about some conflict from the elite Gelug institutions who were used to running their own finances, the most shocking of which was when the 9th Panchen Lama fled for China after losing a power struggle with the Dalai lama. The 13th Dalai Lama also launched a new modern printing of the Tibetan Buddhist canon.

The 20th century saw several influential figures emerge from Gelug institutions, including Gendün Chöphel (1903–1951) and Pabongkha Déchen Nyingpo (1878–1941). During the reign of the 13th Dalai Lama, the so-called &quot;Dorje Shugden controversy&quot; began, spearheaded by the sectarian tendencies of Pabongkha. This division within the Gelug order was based on the worship of a protector deity named Dorje Shugden who was said to punish Gelugs who entered into practices from other Buddhist schools. 13th Dalai Lama (who himself practiced Nyingma Dzogchen and the deity Vajrakilaya) opposed this sectarianism.

=== PRC era, diaspora and the West ===

After the Annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and thousands of Tibetan monasteries were destroyed or damaged (mainly during the 1959 Tibetan uprising and the Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976), and many Gelug monks, including the 14th Dalai Lama fled the country to India as part of the Tibetan diaspora. The three major Gelug monastic colleges (Sera, Drepung and Ganden) were recreated in India. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s current seat is Namgyal Monastery at Dharamshala, this monastery also maintains a branch monastery in Ithaca, New York.

The 14th Dalai Lama is a central leader of the modern Tibetan diaspora and continues to advocate for Tibetan autonomy and human rights as well as continuing to teach Tibetan Buddhism throughout the world. The Dalai Lama has met with numerous political and religious leaders, as well as scientists and philosophers and promotes nonviolence, interfaith dialogue, and the dialogue between Buddhism and science. The Dalai Lama has become one of the world&#x27;s most admired religious figures.

Numerous other Gelug teachers now teach in the West and Gelug centers have become a regular part of Western Buddhism. Perhaps the largest religious organization associated with the Gelug tradition is the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition, founded in 1975 by Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The organization runs numerous meditation centers, several monasteries such as Nalanda monastery in France and as well Maitripa College. Other influential Gelug lamas who have taught western Buddhists include Ngawang Wangyal, Lhundub Sopa (who founded Deer Park Buddhist Center and Monastery), Geshe Rabten, Choden Rinpoche, Kyabje Yongzin Ling Rinpoche, Geshe Lhakdor, and Dhardo Rinpoche. Some Gelug lamas also went on to receive a modern western university education and became published academics, such as Gelek Rinpoche, Geshe Thupten Jinpa, Geshe Gyeltsen, and Sonam Thakchoe.

Some western students of diaspora Gelug lamas (some of which spent time as monastics) have also become scholars of Buddhism as well as translators and teachers, including Alexander Berzin, B. Alan Wallace, Robert Thurman, Robina Courtin, Jeffrey Hopkins, Donald S. Lopez Jr., José Cabezón, Guy Martin Newland, Nicholas Vreeland, Barry Kerzin, Glenn H. Mullin, and Gareth Sparham.

An American Gelug bhiksuni, Thubten Chodron, is the founder and abbess of Sravasti Abbey, the only Tibetan Buddhist training monastery for Western bhiksunis (fully ordained female monastics) and bhikkus (fully ordained male monastics) in the United States.

After the brutal repression of Buddhism during the Maoist period, three Gelug scholars became important figures in the revival of Tibetan studies in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. These were known as the “Three Polymaths”, which were Tséten Zhabdrung (1910–1985), Mugé Samten (1914–1993), and Dungkar Lozang Trinlé (1927–1997).

The Mongolian Gelug school under by the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu, led the revival of Mongolian Buddhism after the fall of communist rule in Mongolia in 1990. The Gelug tradition also has a strong traditional presence in modern Russian Republics like Buryatia, Kalmykia and Tuva.

==Teachings==
===Steps of the path (&quot;lam rim&quot;)===
Tsongkhapa&#x27;s works contain a systematic synthesis of Buddhist doctrine which provides a comprehensive vision of the Buddhist path, based on classical Indian Mahayana and Vajrayana. The main Mahayana teachings are found in various texts such as Tsongkhapa&#x27;s the &quot;Great Exposition of the Graded Path&quot; (&quot;Lam rim chen mo&quot;), the &quot;Middling Graded Path (Lam rim ‘bring ba),&quot; and the &quot;Small Graded Path&quot; (&quot;Lam rim chung ngu&quot;)&quot;.&quot; Other related works include &quot;The Three Principles of the Path, The Foundation of All Good Qualities.&quot; There are also various other expositions of the Lamrim by other figures such as the 3rd Dalai Lama&#x27;s &quot;Essence of Refined Gold&quot; and Panchen Losang Chökyi Gyaltsen&#x27;s &quot;Easy Path&quot; (&quot;de lam&quot;).

These Lamrim works are based on the teachings of the Indian master Atiśa (c. 11th century) in &quot;A Lamp for the Path to Awakening&quot; as well on the works of Shantideva and other Indian Madhyamaka authors. According to Gelug scholastics, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s presentation of the stages of the path is traced through Atisha back to Nagarjuna (who received it from Manjushri). Tsongkhapa is also said to have incorporated elements from Asanga&#x27;s presentation of the path (as taught to him by Maitreya).

The presentation of samatha and vipaśyanā in Tsongkhapa&#x27;s &quot;Lamrim&quot; is also based on eighth-century Indian teacher Kamalaśīla&#x27;s &quot;Bhāvanākrama&quot; (Stages of Meditation). Another important text in Gelug is the &quot;Book of Kadam&quot; also known as the &quot;Kadam Emanation Scripture&quot; which includes teachings from Kadam masters like Atisha and Dromton.

==== The schema of the three motivations ====
As the name indicates, this is a gradual path model in which the practitioner accomplishes varying stages of contemplation and training based on classical Indian Mahayana Buddhism. The presentation of the Buddhist path begins with beings on the lowest level (those who have wrong view and are filled with afflictions) and provides a gradual, step by step path out of this state through diligent training, ethical action and contemplation. According to Powers &quot;the path is envisioned as proceeding in hierarchically arranged stages, and trainees are expected to complete each level before moving on to the next one.&quot;

The Lamrim teachings are commonly organized based on three main graduated scopes of motivation:

* The lowest scope suitable for those who delight in cyclic existence (&quot;samsara&quot;) and desire to seek a good rebirth in higher realms. Spiritual practices that are taught for this motivation include contemplating the preciousness of our human rebirth, turning away from the eight worldly concerns, contemplating the suffering of lower rebirths, contemplation of death, the preciousness of human life, and impermanence, taking refuge in the three jewels and contemplating the karmic law of cause and effect. Another important element for this level is the practice of ethical self-discipline (&quot;sila&quot;) by avoiding the ten harmful actions and cultivating the ten wholesome actions.
* The middle scope of those who are seeking liberation from the round of rebirths for themselves (the Sravaka or Hinayana motivation). The focus of this middle scope is cultivating renunciation and a desire for true freedom. This comes from contemplating how all forms of rebirth (even the highest forms) are unsatisfactory (&quot;duḥkha&quot;) as well as practicing the three trainings of ethics (&quot;sila&quot;), meditative stabilization (&quot;samadhi&quot;) and insight (&quot;vipasyana&quot;). This level also includes contemplating the six root delusions (&quot;kleśa&quot;) that give rise to samsara (attachment, anger, pride, ignorance, wrong views, and doubt) as well as the analysis of samsara contained in the 12 links of dependent origination. Though this level also includes insight into emptiness (&quot;shunyata&quot;), it is not as thoroughly explained as in the Mahayana.
* The highest scope suitable for those who have great compassion and thus seek to attain full Buddhahood so as to aid the liberation of others (Mahāyāna motivation). This begins with the generation of the mind of awakening (&quot;bodhicitta&quot;), and the cultivation of love (&quot;maitrī&quot;) and compassion (&quot;karuṇā&quot;) towards all beings, and proceeds on to the cultivation of practices like the seven point mind training, &quot;exchanging ourselves and others&quot;, tonglen, the bodhisattva vows and the six &quot;paramitas&quot; (including samatha and vipasyana meditation), culminating with the direct realization of emptiness.

The highest scope of &quot;Lamrim&quot; culminates in the Vajrayana methods to aid in the speedy attainment of Buddhahood. Higher motivations are said to build on, but not to subvert the foundation of the earlier ones.

==== Three main elements ====
In his &quot;The Three Principles of the Path&quot;, Tsongkhapa outlines the three main elements of the path to awakening as follows:

# The intention definitely to leave cyclic existence, i.e. renunciation (&quot;naiṣkramya&quot;)
# Generating the intention to attain Buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings (&quot;bodhicitta,&quot; the awakening mind)
# The correct view (&quot;samyak dṛṣṭi&quot;), i.e. a proper understanding of emptiness (&quot;shunyata&quot;).
According to Tsongkhapa, these three elements contain the essence of all Buddhist teachings and practices and are the common goal of all scriptures, treatises and tantras. Furthermore, according to Tsongkhapa, these are not just introductory or partial elements, but essential foundations for all Buddhist practices, sutric (i.e. non-tantric Mahayana) or tantric.

=== Reasoning and meditating on emptiness ===
In Gelug, the achievement of the perfection of wisdom (&quot;prajñaparamita&quot;) requires a proper understanding of the view of emptiness. In the &quot;Lamrim chenmo,&quot; Tsongkhapa rejects the idea that all intellectual effort, concepts, and mental activity are obstacles to spiritual understanding. He also rejects certain views of emptiness, particularly the &quot;shentong&quot; (other emptiness) view, which is seen as a kind of eternalism or essentialism. The proper view of emptiness in the Gelug school is considered to be the prāsangika mādhyamika philosophy of Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti as interpreted by Tsongkhapa. According to Jay Garfield, Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view is &quot;a synthesis of the epistemology and logic of Dharmakirti with the metaphysics of Nagarjuna.&quot;

The correct view of emptiness is initially established through study and reasoning in order to ascertain if phenomena are the way they appear. Gelug texts contain many explanations to help one obtain a conceptual understanding of emptiness and to practice insight meditation (&quot;vipasyana&quot;). Gelug meditation includes an analytical kind of insight practice which is &quot;the point-by-point contemplation of the logical arguments of the teachings, culminating in those for the voidness of self and all phenomena.&quot;

According to John Powers:The initial use of reasoning enables the meditator to recognize that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, and the fact that one is able to demonstrate this through reasoned proofs makes the conviction unshakable. Merely gaining a conceptual apprehension, however, is not enough: one must deepen the understanding of emptiness through repeated familiarization. The more one trains in emptiness, the deeper one’s discernment becomes, until one transcends the need for conceptual thought, and one’s awareness of emptiness reaches the level of direct perception, such that when one considers a phenomenon in meditation, one immediately apprehends its absence of inherent existence.For Tsongkhapa, the training in insight and wisdom is closely associated with training in compassion. Training in insight into emptiness deepens compassion and vice verse. Both reinforce and strengthen each other.

===Vinaya===
The Gelug school focuses on ethics and monastic discipline of the &quot;vinaya&quot; as the central plank of spiritual practice. In particular, the need to pursue spiritual practice in a graded, sequential manner is emphasized. Arguably, Gelug is the only school of vajrayāna Buddhism that prescribes monastic ordination as a necessary qualification and basis in its teachers (lamas / gurus). Lay people are usually not permitted to give initiations if there are teachers with monastic vows within close proximity.

===Vajrayāna (Secret Mantra)===

The tantric practices of the Gelug school are also integrated into the stages of the path model by Tsongkhapa&#x27;s &quot;The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra&quot;. This is combined with the tantric deity yogas of Anuttarayoga Tantras such as the &quot;Guhyasamāja, Cakrasaṃvara, Yamāntaka&quot; and &quot;Kālacakra&quot; tantras.

For Tsongkhapa, Vajrayana practice requires bodhicitta and insight into emptiness (through &quot;vipaśyanā&quot; meditation) as a foundation, and thus, non-tantric Mahayana (and its three principal aspects of renunciation, bodhicitta and insight into emptiness) is seen as indispensable for Vajrayana in Gelug. Indeed, according to Tsongkhapa, without having ascertained emptiness, one cannot practice the tantric yogas of Vajrayana.

The Gelug school also follows Tsongkhapa&#x27;s view that Vajrayana is only differentiated from sutra by its special method, the esoteric practice of deity yoga, which is considered to be a much faster method than the practice of the six perfections alone.

Tsongkhapa&#x27;s tantric practice and theory focuses on the &quot;Guhyasamāja tantra&quot;, a text which he considered to be the &quot;king of tantras&quot;. Tsongkhapa referred to himself as a &quot;&quot;Guhyasamāja&quot; yogi&quot; and saw himself as a reviver and reformer of the tradition. As such, the &quot;Guhyasamāja tantra&quot; is the principal tantra for the Gelug school. As the Dalai Lama remarks:
Tsongkhapa also incorporated the tantric practice of the Six Yogas of Naropa, and Mahamudra, from the Dagpo Kagyu lineages. This tradition was continued by the first Panchen Lama, who composed &quot;A Root Text for the Precious Gelug/Kagyü Tradition of Mahamudra&quot;.

The Gelug tradition also maintains Dzogchen teachings; Lozang Gyatso, 5th Dalai Lama (1617–1682), Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama ( 1876–1933), and Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama are some Gelug-pa Dzogchen masters. Likewise the practice of Chöd was taught by Gelug-pas such as Kyabje Zong Rinpoche.

==== Unique Oral lineage ====

The Gelug tradition also has a unique lineage of oral instructions which is traced back to the teachings received by Tsongkhapa from the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī (Tib. &quot;Jampalyang&quot;). There are two main lineages of this Ganden Mañjuśrī cycle of oral instructions, these are the Ensa tradition (stemming from Gyalwa Ensapa Losang Dondrup) and the Segyu lineage (stemming from Je Sherab Sengye). The teachings of the popular Lama Chöpa practice come down through the Ensa lineage.

According to David Gonsalez:Manjushri instructed Tsongkhapa to combine the teachings on the clear light and illusory body from the &quot;Guhyasamāja&quot; Tantra, the teachings on inner fire and the use of an action mudra from the &quot;Cakrasaṃvara&quot; Tantra, and the practice of Vajrabhairava, using these as a means of increasing wisdom and overcoming obstacles. With this as the foundation for his tantric practice he should establish a basis of lamrim and lojong that is centered on the practice of guru yoga. Manjushri proceeded to give Tsongkhapa detailed teachings on all aspects of the aforementioned teachings and advised him to consolidate them all into a single practice. This was the impetus for the origins of Lama Chöpa. From these instructions there arose a very secret system of guru yoga that was transmitted orally from guru to disciple.

== Study ==
=== Main topics and texts ===
The Gelug school developed a highly structured system of scholastic study which was based on the memorization and study of key texts as well as formal debate. The primary topics and texts used in study are:

# Monastic discipline (&quot;’dul ba&quot;, vinaya): &quot;Vinaya-sutra&quot; by Gunaprabha
# Abhidharma: Vasubandhu’s &quot;Abhidharmakosha&quot;
# Epistemology (&quot;tshad ma&quot;, pramana): which is based on Dharmakirti’s &quot;Pramanavarttika&quot;, a Commentary on Dignaga’s &quot;‘Compendium of Pramana’,&quot;
# Madhyamaka (&quot;dbu-ma&quot;): Chandrakirti’s &quot;Madhyamakāvatāra&quot;.
# Prajnaparamita (&quot;phar-phyin&quot;): Maitreya&#x27;s &quot;Abhisamayalankara&quot;.
All Gelug colleges study commentaries to these texts written by Tsongkhapa, Gyaltsab Je and Kedrub Je.

Six texts by Tsongkhapa are also a prime source for the studies of the Gelug tradition:
# &quot;The Great Exposition of the Stages of the Path&quot; (&quot;Lam-rim chen-mo&quot;)
# &quot;The Great Exposition of Secret Mantra&quot; (&quot;sNgag-rim chenmo&quot;)
# &quot;The Essence of Eloquence on the Interpretive and Definitive Teachings&quot; (&quot;Drnng-nges legs-bshad snying-po&quot;)
# &quot;The Praise of Dependent Origination&quot; (&quot;rTen-&#x27;brel bstodpa&quot;)
# &quot;The Clear Exposition of the Five Stages of Guhyasamāja&quot; (&quot;gSang-&#x27;dus rim-lnga gsal-sgron&quot;) and
# &quot;The Golden Rosary&quot; (&quot;gSer-phreng&quot;)

Each Gelug monastery also uses its own set of commentarial textbooks (&quot;yig-cha&quot;) which were written to explain further scholastic details and interpretative issues. The various sets of Gelug textbooks differ on numerous fine points of interpretation. Major textbook sets include:

* Jetsun Chokyi Gyaltsen&#x27;s (1469–1544) textbooks, studied at Ganden Jangtse, Sera Je and Sera Ngagpa
* Kedrub Tendarwa&#x27;s texts (1493–1568), studied at Sera Me College
* Panchen Sonam Dragpa&#x27;s texts (1478–1554) which are studied at Drepung Losel Ling, Ganden Shartse, Gyütö and Ratö colleges,
* Kunkyen Jamyang Zhepa (1648–1721), studied at Drepung Gomang College, Drepung Deyang College, Labrang Monastery, and most monasteries in Inner and Outer Mongolia, Buryatia, Kalmykia, and Tuva.

=== Course of study ===

According to Georges Dreyfus,

For each topic studied, the procedure is similar. The process starts with the heuristic memorization of the root text and sometimes of its commentaries. It continues with the interpretation of the root text through commentaries, and culminates in dialectical debate.

After the study of the exoteric texts, a monk may then enter the esoteric study and practice of tantric texts, particularly the Guhyasamāja, Yamāntaka, and Cakrasamvara tantras.

A monk who has completed all his studies may then attempt a geshe degree, a title rare and difficult to obtain which can take 15 to 25 years to complete. According to John Powers, &quot;although the Gélukpa tradition recognizes some people as tülkus—beings who are reincarnations of great lamas—the various levels of scholarly achievement are open to any male who is able to complete the program successfully.&quot; There are no major restrictions on a monk&#x27;s ability to attain the various scholastic ranks and geshe degrees other than skill, and they may come from any social class, family or region. Several Westerners have completed the degree in the modern era.

Powers also writes that: the primary method of examination is oral debate, in which a monk must be able quickly to evaluate a wide range of philosophical positions, defend any of them against any other, and triumph (or at least hold his own) in a no-holds-barred intellectual contest. The debates are generally very lively...The stated purpose of the exercise is to develop the intellects of the monks, and it is felt that direct dialectical confrontation accomplishes this goal by training them to defend philosophical positions, to think on their feet, and to critically examine their doctrines and positions.Alexander Berzin notes that in Tibet, there used to only be two examinations (rgyugs-sprod): memorization exam (blo-rgyugs) and debate exams (rtsod-rgyugs). However, according to Berzin, &quot;since the reforms of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama in India, they must also pass each year a written exam (bri-rgyugs), a poetry composition exam (rtsom-bri), and a Tibetan culture and religious history exam (rgyal-rabs chos-byung).&quot;

After attaining a monastic degree, it is common to enter a long meditation retreat, often lasting three years or proceed to tantric (Vajrayana) studies. According to Powers &quot;the logic behind this system is based on the idea that one should first gain a thorough grounding in Buddhist scriptures, philosophy, doctrines, and practice before engaging in full-time meditation. Trainees who thoroughly understand what they are meditating on will be less likely to go astray in meditation than those whose understanding is merely superficial.&quot;

==Monasteries and lineage holders==

===Monasteries===
Tsongkhapa founded the monastery of Ganden in 1409 as his main seat. Drepung Monastery was founded by Jamyang Choje, Sera Monastery was founded by Chöje Shakya Yeshe, and Tashi Lhunpo Monastery was founded by Gyalwa Gendün Drup, the 1st Dalai Lama. These four were the largest and most powerful Gelug monasteries in Tibet. Before the Chinese occupation Ganden and Sera each had about 5,000 monks, while Drepung housed over 7,000.

Labrang Monastery, in Xiahe County in Gansu province (and in the traditional Tibetan province of Amdo), was founded in 1709 by the first Jamyang Zhaypa, Ngawang Tsondru. Many Gelug monasteries and temples were also built throughout Tibet as well as in China and Mongolia. Notable Gelug monasteries in Kham include Lithang, Bathang, Sershul, and Dargye. In the Gyalrong region one finds some of the oldest Gelug monasteries on the eastern plateau such as Dhe-Tsang.

===Administration and lineage===

After Tsongkhapa&#x27;s passing, his teachings were held and spread by Gyaltsab Je and Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, who were his successors as abbots of Ganden Monastery. These were the first &quot;Ganden Tripa&quot; (&quot;dGa’-ldan khri-pa&quot;, Ganden Throne Holder), an office which became the official head of the entire Gelug school. The lineage is still held by the present holder is Thubten Nyima Lungtok Tenzin Norbu, the 102nd Ganden Tripa (and not, as often misunderstood, by the Dalai Lama).

Ganden Tripa is an elected position held by the most senior ex-abbots of Gyume and Gyuto Upper and Lower Tantric Colleges. The office lasts for seven years only. This is in contrast to the other Tibetan schools, who are led either by specific tulkus (reincarnation lineages like the Karmapas) or by a specific clan (like the Sakya school, led by the Khön family).

Among the main lineage holders of the Gelug are:
* The successive incarnations of the Dalai Lama (also commonly referred to as &quot;Gyalwa Rinpoche&quot;)
* The succession of the Panchen Lama, the Chagkya Dorje Chang, Ngachen Könchok Gyaltsen, Kyishö Tulku Tenzin Thrinly, Jamyang Shepa, Phurchok Jampa Rinpoche, Jamyang Dewe Dorje, Takphu Rinpoche, Khachen Yeshe Gyaltsen
* The Jebtsundamba Khutuktus, the spiritual heads of Mongolian Buddhism
* The Changkya Khutukhtus
* The Tatsag Rinpoches
* The Reting Rinpoches
* Successive incarnations of Kyabje Yongzin Ling Rinpoche
* Successive incarnations of Kyabje Yongzin Trijang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso

<text>The Kagyu school, also transliterated as Kagyü, or Kagyud (), which translates to &quot;Oral Lineage&quot; or &quot;Whispered Transmission&quot; school, is one of the main schools (&quot;chos lugs&quot;) of Tibetan (or Himalayan) Buddhism. The Kagyu lineages trace themselves back to the 11th century Indian Mahasiddhas Naropa, Maitripa and the yogini Niguma, via their student Marpa Lotsawa (1012–1097), who brought their teachings to Tibet. Marpa&#x27;s student Milarepa was also an influential poet and teacher.

The Tibetan Kagyu tradition gave rise to a large number of independent sub-schools and lineages. The principal Kagyu lineages existing today as independent schools are those which stem from Milarepa&#x27;s disciple, Gampopa (1079–1153), a monk who merged the Kagyu lineage with the Kadam tradition. The Kagyu schools which survive as independent institutions are mainly the Karma Kagyu, Drikung Kagyu, Drukpa Lineage and the Taklung Kagyu. The Karma Kagyu school is the largest of the sub-schools, and is headed by the Karmapa. Other lineages of Kagyu teachings, such as the Shangpa Kagyu, are preserved in other schools.

The main teachings of the Kagyus include Mahamudra and the Six Dharmas of Naropa.

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
Strictly speaking, the term &quot;bka&#x27; brgyud&quot; &quot;oral lineage&quot;, &quot;precept transmission&quot; applies to any line of transmission of an esoteric teaching from teacher to disciple. There are references to the &quot;Atiśa kagyu&quot; for the Kadam or to &quot;Jonang kagyu&quot; for the Jonang and &quot;Ganden kagyu&quot; for the Gelug sects. Today, however, the term Kagyu almost always refers to the Dagpo Kagyu and, less often, to the Shangpa Kagyu.

===&quot;Kagyu&quot; and &quot;Kargyu&quot;===
In his 1970 article &quot;Golden Rosaries of the Bka&#x27; brgyud schools&quot;, E. Gene Smith discusses the two forms of the name, and :
One source indicates:
==Origins==
Kagyu begins in Tibet with Marpa Lotsawa (1012–1097) a Tibetan householder who trained as a translator with lotsawa Drogmi Shākya Yeshe (993–1050), and then traveled three times to India and four times to Nepal in search of religious teachings. His principal gurus were the siddhas Nāropa - from whom he received the &quot;close lineage&quot; of mahāmudrā and tantric teachings, and Maitrīpāda - from whom he received the &quot;distant lineage&quot; of mahāmudrā.

Together Marpa, Milarepa and Gampopa are known as &quot;Mar-Mi-Dag Sum&quot; () and together these three are considered the founders of the Kagyu school of Buddhism in Tibet.

===Indian origins===
Marpa&#x27;s guru Nāropa (1016–1100) was the principal disciple of Tilopa (988-1089) from East Bengal. From his own teachers Tilopa received the &quot;Four Lineages of Instructions&quot; (), which he passed on to Nāropa who codified them into what became known as the Six Doctrines or Six Dharmas of Naropa. These instructions consist a combination of the completion stage (Skt. &quot;sampannakrama&quot;; Tib. &quot;rdzogs rim&quot;) practices of different Buddhist highest yoga tantras (Skt. &quot;Anuttarayoga Tantra&quot;; ), which use the energy-winds (Skt. &quot;vāyu&quot;, ), energy-channels (Skt. &quot;nāḍi&quot;, ) and energy-drops of the subtle &quot;vajra&quot;-body in order to achieve the four types of bliss, the clear-light mind and realize the state of Mahāmudrā.

The Mahāmudrā lineage of Tilopa and Nāropa is called the &quot;direct lineage&quot; or &quot;close lineage&quot; as it is said that Tilopa received this Mahāmudrā realisation directly from the Dharmakāya Buddha Vajradhara and this was transmitted only through Nāropa to Marpa.

The &quot;distant lineage&quot; of Mahāmudrā is said to have come from the Buddha in the form of Vajradara through incarnations of the bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Mañjuśrī to Saraha, then from him through Nagarjuna, Shavaripa, and Maitripada to Marpa. The Mahāmudrā teachings from Saraha that Maitripa transmitted to Marpa include the &quot;Essence Mahāmudrā&quot; () where Mahāmudrā is introduced directly without relying on philosophical reasoning or yogic practices.

According to some accounts, on his third journey to India Marpa also met Atiśa (982–1054) who later came to Tibet and helped found the Kadam lineage

===Marpa and his successors (Marpa Kagyu)===


Marpa established his &quot;seat&quot; at Drowolung () in Lhodrak in southern Tibet just north of Bhutan. Marpa married the Lady Dagmema, and took eight other concubines as mudras. Collectively they embodied the main consort and eight wisdom dakini in the mandala of his Yidam, Hevajra. Marpa wanted to entrust the transmission lineage to his oldest son, Darma Dode, following the usual Tibetan practice of the time to transmit of lineages of esoteric teachings via hereditary lineage (father-son or uncle-nephew), but his son died at an early age and consequently he passed his main lineage on through Milarepa. Darma Dode&#x27;s incarnation as Indian master Tiphupa became important for the future development of Kagyu in Tibet.

Marpa&#x27;s four most outstanding students were known as the &quot;Four Great Pillars&quot; ():

#Milarepa (1040–1123), born in Gungthang province of western Tibet, the most celebrated and accomplished of Tibet&#x27;s yogis, who achieved the ultimate goal of enlightenment in one lifetime became the holder of Marpa&#x27;s meditation or practice lineage. Among Milarepa&#x27;s many students were Gampopa (1079–1153), a great scholar, and the great yogi Rechung Dorje Drakpa (1088–1158), also known as Rechungpa
#Ngok Choku Dorje () (1036–1102) - was the principal recipient of Marpa&#x27;s explanatory lineages and particularly important in Marpa&#x27;s transmission of the Hevajra Tantra. Ngok Choku Dorje founded the Langmalung temple in the Tang valley of Bumthang district, Bhutan—which stands today. The Ngok branch of the Marpa Kagyu was an independent lineage carried on by his descendants at least up to the time of the Second Drukchen Gyalwang Kunga Paljor (, 1428–1476) who received this transmission, and 1476 when Go Lotsawa composed the &quot;Blue Annals&quot;.
#Tshurton Wangi Dorje () - (or Tshurton Wangdor) was the principal recipient of Marpa&#x27;s transmission of the teachings of the Guhyasamāja Tantra. Tshurton&#x27;s lineage eventually merged with the Shalu Monastery tradition and subsequently passed this down to the Gelug founder Je Tsongkhapa, who wrote extensive commentaries on the Guhyasamāja Tantra.
#Meton Tsonpo ()

Other important students of Marpa include:
*Marpa Dowa Chokyi Wangchuck ().
*Marpa Goleg () who along with Tshurton Wangdor received the Guhyasamāja Tantra.
*Barang Bawacen () - who received lineage of the explanatory teachings of the Mahāmāyā Tantra.

Jamgon Kongtrul (1813–1899) collected the initiations and sadhanas of surviving transmissions of Marpa&#x27;s teachings together in the collection known as the Kagyu Ngak Dzö (, &quot;Treasury of Kagyu Tantras&quot;).

===Gampopa===

Gampopa (1079–1153), who was a Kadampa monk, is an influential figure in the history of the Kagyu tradition. He combined the monastic tradition and the stages of the path (&quot;Lamrim&quot;) teachings of the Kadam order with teaching and practice of the Mahāmudrā and the Six Yogas of Naropa he received from Milarepa synthesizing them into one lineage. This monastic tradition came to be known as Dagpo Kagyu—the main lineage of the Kagyu tradition passed down via Naropa as we know it today. The other main lineage of the Kagyu is the Shangpa Kagyu, passed down via Niguma. Gampopa&#x27;s main contribution was the establishment of a celibate and cenobitic monastic Kagyu order. This was in sharp contrast to the tradition of Marpa and Milarepa which mainly consisted of non-monastic householder or hermit yogis practicing in solitary locations or hermitages. According to John Powers, Marpa &quot;saw the monastic life as appropriate only for people of limited capacities.&quot; Gampopa on the other hand, founded Daklha Gampo Monastery (&quot;Dwags lha sgam po&quot;) and thus allowed the Kagyu teachings to have established training centers and study curricula in a structured monastic setting which was well suited to the preservation of tradition.

Most of the major Kagyu lineages in existence today can be traced through Gampopa.

Following Gampopa&#x27;s teachings, there evolved the so-called &quot;Four Major and Eight Minor&quot; lineages of the Dagpo (sometimes rendered &quot;Tagpo&quot; or &quot;Dakpo&quot;) Kagyu School. This phrase is descriptive of the generation or order in which the schools were founded, not of their importance.

==Dagpo Kagyu lineages==
The principle Dagpo Kagyu lineages that exist today as organized schools are the Karma Kagyu, Drikung Kagyu and the Drukpa Lineage. For the most part, the teachings and main esoteric transmissions of the other Dagpo Kagyu lineages have been absorbed into one of these three independent schools.

Historically, there were twelve main sub schools of the Dagpo Kagyu derived from Gampopa and his disciples. Four primary branches stemmed from direct disciples of Gampopa and his nephew; and eight secondary branches derived from Gampopa&#x27;s disciple Phagmo Drupa. Several of these Kagyu traditions in turn developed their own branches or sub-schools.

The terminology &quot;primary and secondary&quot; (early/later) for the Kagyu schools can only be traced back as far as Kongtrul&#x27;s and other&#x27;s writings (19th century). The Tibetan terminology &quot;che chung&quot;, literally &quot;large (and) small,&quot; does not reflect the size or influence of the schools, as for instance the Drikung school was in the 13th century probably the largest and most influential of them, although it is, according to Kongtrul, &quot;secondary&quot;.Or it can be taken as early and later schools.

===Four primary branches of the Dagpo Kagyu===

====Karma Kamtsang (Karma Kagyu)====
The Drubgyu Karma Kamtsang, often known simply as Karma Kagyu, was founded by one of Gampopa&#x27;s main disciples Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (1110–1193). The figure of Karma Pakshi (1204/6–1283), a student of one of Düsum Khyenpa&#x27;s main disciples, was actually the first person recognized as a &quot;Karmapa&quot;, i.e. a reincarnation of Düsum Khyenpa.

Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama, was an important figure because he received and preserved Dzogchen teachings from Rigdzin Kumaradza and taught this along with Kagyu Mahamudra. He also influenced Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, the founder of the Jonang school who systematized the shentong teachings.
The Karmapas continue to be the heads of the Karma Kagyu order today and remain very influential figures. According to Reginald Ray:Although in the diaspora the sixteenth Karmapa was considered the “head” of the Kagyu lineage, in Tibet the situation was more decentralized. In spite of the titular role of the Karmapa, even in exile the various surviving Kagyu subschools maintain a high degree of independence and autonomy.Following the death of Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa in 1981, followers came to disagree over the identity of his successor. The disagreement of who holds the current title of Karmapa is an ongoing controversy termed the &quot;Karmapa controversy&quot;.

===== Sub-schools of Karma Kagyu =====
The Karma Kagyu school itself has three sub-schools in addition to the main branch:

:*Surmang, founded by Trungmase, 1st Zurmang Gharwang Rinpoche, a student of Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama, this sub-sect was centered on Surmang Monastery, in what is now Qinghai
:*Nédo Kagyu (), founded by Karma Chagme (, 1613–1678), a disciple of the 6th Shamarpa (, 1584–1630)
:*Gyaltön Kagyu

====Barom Kagyu====
The Barom Kagyu was founded by Gampopa&#x27;s disciple Barompa Darma Wangchuk (, 1127–1199–1200), who established the Nak River Barom Riwoche Monastery () in 1160. This school was popular in the Principality of Nangchen in Kham (modern Nangqên County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, southern Qinghai) where it has survived in one or two pockets to the present day.

An important early master of this school was Tishri Repa Sherab Senge (, 1164–1236).

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche (1920–1996) was a holder of the Barom Kagyu Lineage.

====Tshalpa Kagyu====
The Tshalpa Kagyu was established by Zhang Yudrakpa Tsöndru Drakpa (, 1123–1193), who founded Tsel Gungtang Monastery (). Lama Zhang was a disciple of Gampopa&#x27;s nephew Dagpo Gomtsul Tsultim Nyingpo (, 1116–1169).

The Tshalpa Kagyu tradition continued to function independently until the 15th century when it was absorbed by the Gelug, who still maintain many of its transmissions. All of the former Tshelpa properties became Gelug possessions under the administration of Sera monastery.

====Phagdru Kagyu====

The Phagmo Drupa Kagyu () or Phagdru Kagyu (ཕག་གྲུ་བཀའ་བརྒྱུད) was founded by Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo (, 1110–1170) who was the elder brother of the famous Nyingma lama Ka Dampa Deshek (1122–1192) founder of Katok Monastery. Before meeting Gampopa, Dorje Gyalpo studied with Sachen Kunga Nyingpo &quot;(sa chen kun dga&#x27; snying po)&quot; (1092–1158) from whom he received lamdre transmission.

From 1435 to 1481 the power of the Phagmodrupa declined and they were eclipsed by the Rinpungpa () of Tsang, who patronized the Karma Kagyu. The Phagmo Drupa monastery of Dentsa Thel &quot;was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in 1966-1978&quot;

===Eight Secondary branches of the Dagpo Kagyu===

The eight secondary lineages (&quot;zung bzhi ya brgyad&quot; or &quot;chung brgyad&quot;) of the Dagpo Kagyu all trace themselves to disciples of Phagmo Drupa. Some of these secondary schools, notably the Drikung Kagyu and Drukpa Kagyu, became more important and influential than others.

====Drikung Kagyu====

One of the most important of the Kagyu sects still remaining today, the Drikung Kagyu (འབྲི་གུང་བཀའ་པརྒྱུད་པ) takes its name from Drigung Monastery founded by Jigten Sumgön, also known as Drikung Kyopa.

The special Kagyu teachings of the Drikung tradition include the &quot;Single Intention&quot; (), &quot;The Essence of Mahāyāna Teachings&quot; (), and the &quot;Fivefold Profound Path of Mahāmudrā&quot; ().

Since the 15th century the Drikung Kagyupa received influence from the &quot;northern terma&quot; () teachings of the Nyingma tradition.

====Lingre Kagyu====
Lingre Kagyu refers to the lineages founded by Lingrepa Pema Dorje () [1128-1188] also known as Nephupa after Nephu monastery &quot;(sna phu dgon)&quot; he founded near Dorje Drak &quot;(rdo rje brag)&quot; in Central Tibet &quot;(dbus)&quot;. Lingrepa&#x27;s teachers were Gampopa&#x27;s disciple Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo; Rechungpa&#x27;s disciple Sumpa Repa; and Ra Yeshe Senge, a lineage holder of Ra Lotsawa.

====Drukpa Lineage====
The Drukpa Lineage was established by Ling Repa&#x27;s main disciple, Tsangpa Gyare (1161–1211), who established monasteries at Longbol () and Ralung Monastery (). Later, Tsangpa Gyare went to a place called Nam Phu where, legend has it, nine roaring dragons rose from the ground and soared into the sky. The Tibetan word for dragon is &quot;Druk&quot; (), so Tsangpa Gyare&#x27;s lineage and the monastery he established at the place became known as the &quot;Drukpa&quot; and he became known as the Gyalwang Drukpa. This school became widespread in Tibet and in surrounding regions. Today the Southern Drukpa Lineage is the state religion of Bhutan, and in the western Himalayas, Drukpa Lineage monasteries are found in Ladakh, Zanskar, Lahaul and Kinnaur.

Along with the Mahamudra teachings inherited from Gampopa and Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo, particular teachings of the Drukpa Lineage include the &quot;Six Cycles of Equal Taste&quot; (), a cycle of instructions said to have been hidden by Rechung Dorje Drakpa and discovered by Tsangpa Gyare, and the &quot;Seven Auspicious Teachings&quot; () revealed to Tsangpa Gyare by seven Buddhas who appeared to him in a vision at Tsari.

====Shuksep Kagyu====
The Shuksep Kagyu () was established by Gyergom Chenpo Zhönnu Drakpa (, 1090–1171), who founded the Shuksep Monastery in Nyiphu. The Shuksep Kagyu emphasized the Mahamudra teachings of the &quot;doha&quot;s, spiritual songs of realization by Indian masters such as Saraha, Shavaripa, Tilopa, Naropa and Maitripa. A notable member of this lineage was the nun Shukseb Jetsun Chönyi Zangmo.

====Taklung Kagyu====

The Taklung Kagyu (), named after Taklung Monastery established in 1180 by Taklung Thangpa Tashi Pal (1142–1210).

====Trophu Kagyu====
The Trophu Kagyu () was established by Gyeltsa Rinchen Gön (, 1118–1195) and Künden Repa (, 1148–1217). The tradition was developed by their nephew, Thropu Lotsawa, who invited Pandit Shakyasri of Kashmir, Buddhasri and Mitrayogin to Tibet.

The most renowned adherent of this lineage was Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364) of Zhalu, who was a student of Trophupa Sonam Sengge () and Trophu Khenchen Rinchen Senge (). Other notable teachers of this tradition include Chegompa Sherab Dorje (1130?-1200)

====Yazang Kagyu====
The Yazang Kagyu () founded by Sharawa Kalden Yeshe Sengge (d. 1207). His foremost disciple was Yazang Chöje Chö Mönlam (1169–1233) who in 1206 established the monastery of Yabzang, also known as Nedong Dzong, in Yarlung. The Yazang Kagyu survived as an independent school at least until the 16th century.

====Yelpa Kagyu====
The Yelpa Kagyu () was established by Druptop Yéshé Tsekpa (, b. 1134). He established two monasteries, Shar Yelphuk () and Jang Tana ().

==Shangpa Kagyu==

The Shangpa Kagyu () differs in origin from the better known Marpa or Dagpo school that is the source of all present-day Kagyu schools. The Dagpo school and its branches primarily came from the lineage of the Indian siddhas Tilopa and Naropa transmitted in Tibet through Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa and their successors. In contrast, the Shangpa lineage descended from two female siddhas, Naropa&#x27;s consort Niguma and Virupa&#x27;s disciple Sukhasiddhi, transmitted in Tibet in the 11th century through Khyungpo Nenjor. The tradition takes its name from the Shang Valley where Khyungpo Nenjor established the gompa of Zhongzhong or Zhangzhong.

For seven generations, the Shangpa Kagyu lineage remained a one-to-one transmission. Although there were a few temples and retreat centres in Tibet and Bhutan associated with the Shangpa transmission, it never really was established as an independent religious institution or sect. Rather, its teachings were transmitted down through the centuries by lamas belonging to many different schools.

In the 20th century, the Shangpa teachings were transmitted by the first Kalu Rinpoche, who studied at Palpung Monastery, the seat of the Tai Situpa.

==Teaching and practice==
===View===
There are various Kagyu presentations of the right philosophical view depending on the specific lineage.

Some Kagyu lineages follow the Shentong (empty of other) presentations which was influenced by the work of Dolpopa. This view was defended by the influential Rime philosopher Jamgön Kongtrül Lodrö Thayé (1813–1899). &quot;Shentong&quot; views the two truths doctrine as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is &quot;empty&quot; () only of &quot;other&quot; () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty. In Shentong, this absolute reality (i.e. Buddha nature) is the &quot;ground or substratum&quot; which is &quot;uncreated and indestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination.&quot; According to Jamgon Kontrul, this ultimate reality which is &quot;nondual, self-aware primordial wisdom&quot; can be said to &quot;always exists in its own nature and never changes, so it is never empty of its own nature and it is there all the time.&quot; However, this wisdom is also free of conceptual elaborations and also &quot;free of the two extremes of nihilism and eternalism.&quot; This Shentong view has been upheld by various modern Kagyu masters such as Kalu Rinpoche and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche.

However, as noted by Karl Brunnholzl, several important Kagyu figures have disagreed with the view of &quot;Shentong Madhyamaka&quot;, such as Mikyö Dorje, the 8th Karmapa Lama (1507–1554) and Second Pawo Rinpoche Tsugla Trengwa, both of whom see &quot;Shentong&quot; as another name for Yogacara and as a separate system to Madhyamaka. In his &quot;Chariot of the Takpo Kagyü Siddhas&quot;, Mikyö Dorje attacks the shentong view of Dolpopa as being against the sutras of ultimate meaning which state that all phenomena are emptiness as well as being against the treatises of the Indian masters. He argued that the rangtong shentong distinction is inaccurate and not in line with the teachings of the Indian masters. As noted by Brunnholzl, he also argues that &quot;teachings on Buddha nature being a self, permanent, substantial, really existent, indestructible, and so on are of expedient meaning.&quot; The writings of the Ninth Karmapa, Wangchuk Dorje, particularly his &quot;Feast for the Fortunate&quot;, also follow this view in critiquing the Shentong Madhyamaka position and arguing that &quot;the Buddha taught buddha nature as provisional meaning&quot;.

===Practice===
With regards to presentations of the path, the surviving Dagpo Kagyu schools rely on the &quot;Lamrim&quot; (stages of the path) format outlined by Gampopa in his &quot;Jewel Ornament of Liberation.&quot; The practice of &quot;Lojong&quot; (Mind training) which derives from the Kadam school is also important.

The central meditative practice in Kagyu is Mahamudra, &quot;the Great Seal&quot;. This doctrine focuses on four principal stages (the Four Yogas of Mahamudra), namely:

#The development of single-pointedness of mind
#The transcendence of all conceptual elaboration
#The cultivation of the perspective that all phenomena are of a &quot;single taste&quot;
#The fruition of the path, which is beyond any contrived acts of meditation

The central tantric deities of the Kagyu schools are Cakrasaṃvara and his consort Vajravārāhī.

A central set of practices maintained in the Kagyu schools are the Six Dharmas of Naropa. The Six Dharmas consists of the following yogic practices:

* &quot;tummo&quot; – the yoga of inner heat (or mystic heat).
* &quot;gyulü&quot; – the yoga of the illusory body.
* &quot;ösel&quot; – the yoga of the clear light or radiant light.
* &quot;milam&quot; – the yoga of the dream state.
* &quot;bardo&quot; – the yoga of the in-between. 
* &quot;phowa&quot; – the yoga of the transference of consciousness

Other practices which are taught in the Kagyu schools include:

* Chöd lineage
* Kalachakra (derived from the Jonang lineage)
* White Tara (derived from the Kadam school)
* Practices of deities such as Green Tara, Avalokiteshvara, Vajrakilaya and Padmasambhava (derived from the Nyingma school)

<text>COMAL (&quot;Common Algorithmic Language&quot;) is a computer programming language developed in Denmark by Børge R. Christensen and Benedict Løfstedt and originally released in 1975. It was based on the BASIC programming language, adding multi-line statements and well-defined subroutines among other additions.

COMAL was originally written for minicomputers, but was small enough to run on early microcomputers as well. It is one of the few structured programming languages that were available for and comfortably usable on 8-bit home computers. 

&quot;COMAL Kernel Syntax &amp; Semantics&quot; contains the formal definition of the language. Further extensions are common to many implementations.

== History ==
===Minicomputer versions===
COMAL was originally developed in Denmark by mathematics teacher Børge R. Christensen. The school in which he taught had received a Data General Nova 1200 minicomputer in 1972, with the expectation that the school would begin to teach computer science. Christensen, who had taken a short course on the subject at university, was expected to lead the program and to maintain the computer system.

The NOVA was supplied with Data General Extended BASIC, and Christensen quickly became frustrated with the way in which the unstructured language led students to write low-quality code that was difficult to read and thus mark. While complaining about these problems to computer scientist Benedict Løfstedt, Løfstedt encouraged Christensen to read &quot;Systematic Programming&quot;, the then-new book on programming language design by Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal. Christensen was impressed, but found that he could not use Pascal directly, as it lacked the interactive shell that made BASIC so easy for students to develop with.

Over the next six months Christensen and Løfstedt corresponded by mail to design an alternative to BASIC which retained its interactive elements but added structured elements from Pascal. By 1974, the language&#x27;s definition was complete but Christensen was unsuccessful in attracting interest from software firms in developing an implementation. Over the next six months he worked with two of his students, to whom he had taught NOVA 1200 machine language, to write an implementation themselves. One of the first things added was the ability to use eight-character variable names, up from the typical one or two. Later additions in the first version included multi-line statements, and the definitions and the statement to call them.

The first proof-of-concept implementation (running a five-line loop) was ready on 5 August 1974, and the first release (on paper tape) was ready in February 1975. Development costs had been around . Only now did the system (which had previously used an internal Danish name) pick up the name &quot;COMAL&quot;, for &quot;Common Algorithmic Language&quot;, inspired by ALGOL, with which Christensen had been experimenting. The first release was therefore named &quot;COMAL 75&quot;. Christensen subsequently wrote a textbook on the language which evolved into &quot;Beginning COMAL&quot;.

===Microcomputer versions===
In 1978, Christensen began to adapt COMAL such that it would run on microcomputers, which were becoming available. He was worried that without such an implementation he would be required to teach and use BASIC again as Danish schools acquired the new machines. By 1980, a version of COMAL developed in conjunction with a college group was able to run on the Zilog Z80, and thus &quot;COMAL 80&quot; was released.

Around the same time, a Danish firm introduced the Comet, a very capable microcomputer for the time, which would be the first machine to run a version of what would look like the later COMAL releases. Christensen subsequently stepped back from COMAL development around 1980-81, which was handed over to groups including UniComal, started by Mogens Kjaer, who had written to Christensen with critiques of COMAL and subsequently ported it to the Commodore PET for release 0.14. At this time, Danish schools insisted that COMAL be available on any microcomputer they purchased.

In the early 1980s, Apple Computer won a contract to supply Apple II computers running CP/M and COMAL to Irish secondary schools. It was popular for education and some textbooks were locally written.

In 1984, Acornsoft released a COMAL implementation, by David Christensen, Jim Warwick and David Evers, for their 8-bit BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers (with a manual by Paul Christensen and Roy Thornton)

Between 1984-1987, TeleNova, a subsidiary of the industrial arm of the Swedish Telecoms system, manufactured a desktop PC called &quot;Compis&quot; for the educational sector. An enhanced version of COMAL was supplied as the standard programming language for this PC. Versions were created for both CP/M-86 and MS-DOS. The latter version is available for Windows XP. The (Swedish) reference manual is .

In 1990, Thomas Lundy and Rory O&#x27;Sullivan produced the definitive text on COMAL Programming. They matched and compared COMAL with BBC Structured Basic.

As of 2016, COMAL is still actively in use as an educational programming language. Some high schools in the United Kingdom continue to use it to teach the subject of computing.

== Description ==
COMAL was created as a mixture of the prevalent educational programming languages of the time, BASIC, Pascal, and, at least in the Commodore and Compis versions, the turtle graphics of Logo. The language was meant to introduce structured programming elements in an environment where BASIC would normally be used.

In early versions, the primary additions to the language were block versions of IF...THEN, and the PROC construct. In most previous versions of BASIC, the only block construct was the FOR...NEXT loop. For instance:

10 FOR I=1 TO 10
20 PRINT I
30 J=J+1
40 NEXT I

This example performs a loop ten times, and performs two instructions every time through the loop. In contrast, almost every other instruction in BASIC, or &quot;statement&quot;, has to be accomplished on a single line. This can make multi-line statements difficult to perform on an all-or-nothing basis. For instance, if a program desires to run three instructions if a particular value is greater than 10, the typical solution is:

10 IF A&lt;=10 THEN 50
20 PRINT &quot;A IS GREATER THAN 10&quot;
30 A=A+10
40 PRINT &quot;A IS NOW &quot;;A
50 PRINT &quot;RETURNING TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING&quot;

This sort of construct hides the true intention of the program, the decision is based on the opposite logic of what the programmer actually wants to accomplish. Additionally, to understand what will happen in this case, the reader has to find line 50, which in real programs might be much further into the source code. This is one of the major reasons that BASIC programs are referred to as &quot;spaghetti code&quot;, as to follow the logic one moves around the program as if following a series of random spaghetti noodles.

COMAL addresses this issue through the use of blocks. To accomplish this same series of instructions, in COMAL one would write:

10 IF A&gt;10 THEN
20 PRINT &quot;A IS GREATER THAN 10&quot;
30 A=A+10
40 PRINT &quot;A IS NOW &quot;;A
50 ENDIF
60 PRINT &quot;RETURNING TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING&quot;

In this case, the author writes the decision they are actually trying to accomplish, and the reader can follow the logic simply by looking for the . This is aided by COMAL&#x27;s use of leading spaces to visually indicate blocks.

== Examples ==

* &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
PRINT &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
* Conditions
IF condition THEN
 instructions
ENDIF
* Loops
FOR number:= 1 TO 1000 DO 
 PRINT number
ENDFOR
* Print statements with variables

<doc id="197705" wikidata="Q3205308" url="?curid=197705" title="Chugach">
<text>Chugach , Chugach Sugpiaq or Chugachigmiut is the name of an Alaska Native people in the region of the Kenai Peninsula and Prince William Sound on the southern coast of Alaska. The Chugach people are an Alutiiq (Pacific Native) people who speak the Chugach dialect of the Alutiiq language.

==Name==
Their autonym &quot;Sugpiaq&quot; derives from &quot;suk&quot;, meaning &quot;person&quot; and -&quot;piaq&quot;, meaning &quot;real.&quot; The term &quot;Alutiiq&quot; derives from the Russian term for the Aleut people. According to Ethnologue, earlier terms for the Chugach such as Chugach Eskimo, South Alaska Eskimo, Sugpiak Eskimo, and Sugpiaq Eskimo, are pejorative.

==Settlements==
Chugach villages include Chenega Bay, Eyak, Nanwalek (English Bay), Port Graham, and Tatitlek.

==History==

The Chugach people have lived in the region around Prince William Sound for millennia, according to archaeological finds. They were the first indigenous Alaskans to encounter the Russian explorer Vitus Bering in 1741. The Russians were followed by Spanish, English, and American explorers. The Chugach have at times traded with or fought against neighboring groups, the Eyak, Ahtna, and the Tlingit.

In 1964, a tsunami generated by the Good Friday earthquake destroyed the Chugach village of Chenega, Alaska. The fishing-based Chugach economy was badly affected by the environmental damage caused by the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill in 1989.

==Language==
Chugach people speak one of two dialects of the Pacific Gulf Yupik language; the other being Koniag. These Central Yupik languages belong to the Alaskan Yupik language family. Once written in Cyrillic script, the language is now written in the Latin script.

==Social structures and gender==
There are historical accounts of some androgynous third gender or two spirit individuals among the Chugach, known as &quot;aranu&#x27;tiq&quot;. According to anthropologists writing in the 1950s, these individuals were considered to be male on one side of their bodies and female on the other. Some had descriptive names like &quot;Tyakutyik&quot; (&quot;What Kind Of People Are These Two?&quot;), but this description was given to many types of people in the community, and was not related to gender expression.

==Namesakes==
The Chugach people gave their name to Chugach National Forest, the Chugach Mountains, and Alaska&#x27;s Chugach State Park, all located in or near the traditional range of the Chugach people in southcentral Alaska. Chugach Alaska Corporation, an Alaska Native regional corporation created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, also derives its name from the Chugach people, many of whom are shareholders of the corporation.

<text>The T-80 is a main battle tank (MBT) that was designed and manufactured in the former Soviet Union and manufactured in Russia. The T-80 is based on the T-64, while incorporating features from the later T-72 and changing the engine to a gas turbine. When it entered service in 1976, it was the first production tank to be powered solely by turbine.

The chief designer of the T-80 was Soviet engineer Nikolay Popov. The T-80U was last produced in 2001 in a factory in Omsk, Russia. In 2023, the CEO of Uralvagonzavod announced that production would restart.

The Ukrainian T-80UD diesel engine variant continued to be produced in Ukraine. The T80 and its variants are in service in Belarus, Cyprus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Russia, South Korea, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Ukraine further developed the T80UD as the T84.

== History ==
=== Development ===
The project to build the first Soviet turbine powered tank began in 1949. Its designer was A. Ch. Starostienko, who worked at the Leningrad Kirov Plant (LKZ). The tank was never built because available turbine engines were of very poor quality.

In 1955, two prototype 1,000 hp (746 kW) turbine engines were built at the same plant under the guidance of G. A. Ogloblin. Two years later a team led by Josef Kotin constructed two prototypes of the Object 278 tank. Both were hybrids of the IS-7 and the T-10 heavy tanks, powered by the GTD-1 turbine engine, weighing 53.5 tonnes and armed with an M65 130 mm tank gun. The turbine engine allowed the tank to reach a maximum speed of , however with only 1,950 liters of fuel on board, their range was limited to only . The two tanks were considered experimental vehicles and work on them eventually ceased.

In 1963, the Morozov Design Bureau designed the T-64, normally powered by the 5TDF diesel. They also experimented with the T-64T with GTD-3TL turbine engines which generated 700 hp (522 kW). This was tested until 1965. At the same time, at Uralvagonzavod, a design team under the guidance of Leonid N. Kartsev created the Object 167T tank. In 1964, in its report to First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, the team reported that the design was not worth pursuing partly due to its high fuel use.
In 1960, Khrushchev ended all heavy tank programs. LKZ, concerned with the poor reliability of the 5TD diesel engine of the T-64, was freed to focus on gas turbine tank engine development. In 1967, the S. P. Izotov bureau at the Klimov Research-Production Association was assigned to this project. Rather than re-purpose an existing helicopter engine, Izotov built the GTD-1000T from scratch.

In 1966, the LKZ built the experimental Object 288 &quot;rocket tank,&quot; powered by two Klimov GTD-350 turbine engines from the Mil Mi-2 helicopter, offering a combined power of 691 hp (515 kW). Trials indicated that twin propulsion was no better than the turbine engine which had been in development since 1968 at LKZ and Omsktransmash.

==== Object 219 ====
The tank from LKZ equipped with this turbine engine was designed by Nikolay Popov. It was constructed in 1969 and designated &quot;Object 219 SP1&quot;. It was essentially the T-64T powered by a GTD-1000T multi-fuel gas turbine engine producing up to 1,000 hp (746 kW). During the trials it became clear that the increased weight and dynamic characteristics required a complete redesign of the vehicle&#x27;s suspension. The second prototype, designated &quot;Object 219 SP2&quot;, received bigger drive sprockets and return rollers. The number of road wheels was increased from five to six. The construction of the turret was altered to use the same compartment, 125 mm 2A46 tank gun, autoloader and placement of ammunition as the T-64A. Some other equipment was borrowed from the T-64A. The LKZ plant built a series of prototypes based on Object 219 SP2.

==Production history==

In November 1974, Minister of Defence Andrei Grechko, denied approval to put the Object-219 into production due to the tank&#x27;s high fuel use and lack of advantages in armament and armour over other tanks then in production. Grechko died in April 1976, and Dmitry Ustinov, an enthusiastic supporter of the Object 219, was appointed in his place. The Object 219-2 was accepted for production as the T-80 in August 1976.

The Object 219R, incorporating Combination K composite armour, was accepted for Soviet service in 1978 as the T-80B. Production of the original T-80 ended that same year. The T-80B entered production at Omsktransmash in 1979. Omsk developed a command version called the T-80BK. The T-80B was deployed with the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany in 1981.

Initially, the T-80 was confused with the Soviet T-72 by some Western analysts. They are the products of different design bureaus; the T-80 is from the SKB-2 design bureau of the Kirov Factory (LKZ) in Leningrad while the T-72 is from the Uralvagonzavod factory in Nizhny Tagil. They are similar in superficial appearance, but the T-80 is based on the earlier T-64, while incorporating features from the T-72, which was a complementary design. The T-64 in turn was an earlier high-technology main battle tank, designed by the Morozov Design Bureau in Kharkiv to replace the T-54/55 and T-62 MBTs, used before in the Soviet Union.

From a distance, the T-64, T-72 and T-80 look alike. Despite the similarities, the T-80 is 90 cm longer than the T-64, and the T-80 and T-72 are mechanically very different. The T-72 is mechanically simpler, easier to manufacture, and easier to service in the field. As such, the T-72 was intended to be a tank mass-produced to equip the bulk of the Soviet motor rifle units, and for sale to export partners and Eastern-bloc satellite states.

The T-80 design improved on several aspects of the earlier T-64 design, introducing a gas turbine engine in the original model, and incorporating suspension components of the T-72. This gave the tank a high power-to-weight ratio and made it easily the most mobile tank in service, albeit with acute range problems, as the turbine used fuel rapidly, even at engine idle. (Morozov&#x27;s subsequent parallel development of the T-80UD replaced the gas turbine with a commercial turbo-diesel, to decrease fuel use and maintenance needs.) In comparison to its anticipated opponent, the American M1 Abrams has a larger, 1,500 hp (1,120 kW), gas turbine, but weighs 61 tons compared to the T-80s 42.6 tons, so it has a worse hp/t ratio of 24.5 compared to 27.1 and is less manoeuvrable than the T-80 (with GT). The T-80 can fire the same 9K112 Kobra (AT-8 Songster) anti-tank guided missile through the main gun as the T-64.

The T-80U main battle tank (1985, &quot;U&quot; for &quot;uluchsheniye&quot;, meaning &quot;improvement&quot;) was designed by SKB-2 in Leningrad (hull) and the Morozov Bureau (turret and armament). It is a further development of the T-80A and is powered by the 1,250 hp (919 kW) GTD-1250 gas turbine. It is a step ahead of the GTD-1000T and GTD-1000TF engines that were installed on the previous tanks of the T-80 line. This gas turbine can use jet fuels, diesel, and low-octane gasoline, and has good dynamic stability, service life, and reliability. The GTD-1250 has a built-in automatic system of dust deposit removal. It retains the T-80s high fuel use, which the Russian army found unacceptable during the First Chechen War. It is equipped with the 2A46 fire control system and a new turret. The T-80U is protected by a second generation of explosive reactive armour called &quot;Kontakt-5&quot;, which can reduce the penetration of armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) rounds, such as the M829A1 &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;, by 38%, and of high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds. &quot;Kontakt-5&quot; had been developed as a response to the threat of modern APFSDS spurred by testing that found that the Israeli 105mm M111 APFSDS ammunition could defeat the glacis armour of the latest models of the T-72 and T-80.

The &quot;Kontakt-5&quot; is integrated into the design of the turret, hull, and Brod-M deep wading equipment. Like all of the previous T-80 models, the T-80U has full length rubber side skirts protecting the sides with those above the first three road wheels being armoured and are provided with lifting handles. It can fire the 9M119 Refleks (AT-11 Sniper) guided missile and the long-rod penetrator (HVAPFSDS) 3BM46. The remotely controlled commander&#x27;s machine gun was replaced by a more flexible pintle-mounted one. A special camouflage paint distorts the tank&#x27;s appearance in the visible and IR wavebands. The T-80U&#x27;s 1A46 fire control system includes a laser range finder, a ballistics computer, and a more advanced 1G46 gunner&#x27;s main sights, which greatly increases the T-80Us firepower over previous models. These new systems, together with the 125 mm D-81TM &quot;Rapira-3&quot; smooth bore gun, ensure that the T-80U can hit targets at a range of up to 5 kilometers (ATGMs and HV/APFSDS). An experienced crew at the international exhibition was able to successfully strike 52 targets without a miss at a distance of 5 km using guided rockets.

The T-80U(M) of the 1990s introduced the TO1-PO2 Agava gunner&#x27;s thermal imaging sight and 9M119M Refleks-M guided missile, and later, an improved 2A46M-4 version of the 125 mm gun and 1G46M gunner&#x27;s sight was used.

Russian tank production faltered in the years before and after the breakup of the Soviet Union. At the two remaining Russian tank plants, state orders all but ceased. Omsk, then the only Russian producer of the T-80, received orders for just five T-80Us in 1992. Around the same time, the Russian Ministry of Defense decided it would commit to eventually producing one tank type only. Though both Nizhni-Tagil&#x27;s T-90 and Omsk&#x27;s T-80U had their merits, the T-80 was notorious for its high fuel use and production cost. Also, Russian T-80BVs suffered appalling losses in their first combat use during the First Chechen War. T-90s, which were not deployed to Chechnya, were spared media criticism despite the similarly poor performance of the T-72 (the T-90&#x27;s not-so-different ancestor) in the same conflict. In January 1996, Colonel General Aleksandr Galkin, chief of Main Armour Directorate of the Russian Ministry of Defense, said the Russian Armed Forces would phase out T-80 production in favor of the T-90 (Galkin reversed his position later that year, claiming the T-80U was a superior tank). Production of the T-80 at Omsk persisted until 2001, mainly for the export market. In September 2023, the CEO of Uralvagonzavod, Alexander Potapov, said that they had been tasked by the military to resume manufacture of the T-80. It is unknown how long the process of restarting the production line will take.

===Ukrainian T-80UD===
In parallel with the T-80U and Russia in general, the Morozov Bureau in Ukraine developed a diesel-powered version, the T-80UD. It is powered by the 1,000 hp 6TD-6-cylinder opposed-piston multi-fuel two-stroke turbo-piston diesel engine, ensuring high fuel efficiency and a long cruising range. The engine support systems make it possible to operate the tank at ambient temperatures of up to 55 °C and ford water obstacles 1.8 m in depth. The T-80UD shares most of the T-80U&#x27;s improvements, but can be distinguished from it by a different engine deck and distinctive smoke-mortar array and turret stowage boxes. It retains the remotely-controlled commander&#x27;s machine gun. About 500 T-80UD tanks were built in the Malyshev plant between 1987 and 1991. About 300 were still at the Ukrainian factory when the Soviet Union broke up, so the T-80UD tank was welcomed into Ukrainian military service, and therefore is more common in Ukrainian service than Russian. Unlike Russia, Ukraine has had much better success selling T-80s to foreign customers. Cyprus bought a number of T-80Us and T-80UKs from Russia for its army. Pakistan bought Ukrainian T-80UDs for the Pakistan Armoured Corps.

The Ukrainian T-84 main battle tank is based on the T-80UD. Ukraine was only able to afford a negligible number of T-84s for its own use, but did market the tank for export. The T-84 Oplot (first delivered in 2001) introduced turret-bustle ammunition storage; and to offer more sales to international market, the T-84-120 Yatagan has been offered for export, featuring a very large turret bustle and NATO-compatible 120 mm gun.

==Service history==
===Soviet Union===

In 1989, there were 3,000 T-80 MBTs overall. According to data published in Russia, 2,256 T-80s (up to the T-80BV model, as T-80Us were never deployed in Europe) were stationed with the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany in East Germany between 1986 and 1987. In 1991, when the Soviet Union was breaking up, the Soviet Army operated 4,839 T-80 MBTs of several different models.

In August 1991, communists and allied military commanders tried to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev and regain control over the unstable Soviet Union. T-80UD tanks of the 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division drove onto the streets of Moscow, but the Soviet coup attempt failed when the tank crews refused to attack the crowd or the parliament.

===Russia===

Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the T-80 was not used in the way in which it was intended (large-scale conventional war in Europe). Until 2022, it was deployed amid the political and economic turmoil in Russia during the 1990s.

Most T-80 MBTs are possessed by Russia, though many were inherited by Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.

In 1995, the number of T-80 tanks increased to around 5,000 but shrank to 3,500 in 1998.

The Russian Army had 3,044 T-80s and variants in active service and 1,456 in reserve . There are at least 460 T-80U in service with the 2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division and 4th Guards Kantemirowsk Motor Rifle Division. A T-80BV is on display in Kubinka Tank Museum and a T-80U is on display at an open-air museum in Saratov. The T-80Us have recently been seen at arms expos in Russia such as VTTV.

During the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, Boris Yeltsin ordered the use of tanks against the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies opposing him. On 4 October 1993, six T-80UDs from the 13th Guards Tank Regiment, 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division took positions on a bridge opposite the Russian parliament building, and fired on it.

====First Chechen War====
Neither the T-80B nor the T-80BV were ever used in the Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s in order to keep the tank&#x27;s characteristics a secret, but they were first used during the First Chechen War. This first real combat experience for T-80 was unsuccessful, as the tanks were used to capture cities, a task for which they were not very well suited, in particular due to the low depression and elevation of the 2A46-M1 gun on all Russian MBTs.

The biggest tank losses were incurred during the ill-fated assault in the Battle of Grozny, which began in December 1994. During three months of combat, Russia lost 18 of the 84 T-80 tanks used by the 133rd and 3rd Tank Battalions. The forces chosen to capture Grozny were not prepared for such an operation, while the city was defended by, among others, former Soviet soldiers. Some T-80 tanks used in the assault lacked explosive reactive armour inserts.

Several tank-to-tank battles were recorded. During the fighting in late December 1994 and early January 1995, Russian T-80 tanks destroyed at least six rebel tanks. On the opposing side, one T-80 was disabled by a 125 mm shell. Another T-80 received three or four tank shell hits but remained in service. In August 1996, a T-80 destroyed one rebel tank.

The inexperienced crews had little knowledge of the layout of the city, while the tanks were attacked by rocket-propelled grenade teams hidden in cellars and on top of high buildings. The anti-tank fire was directed at the least armoured parts of the vehicles.

In the buildup of forces before the assault on Grozny, T-80s had been transferred from depots to units with little experience with the tank. When no auxiliary power unit is equipped, the T-80&#x27;s gas turbine engines use almost as much fuel idling as when they are running. Most tank crews inadvertently exhausted their fuel this way on the day of the assault.

====After the First Chechen War====
The T-80 performed so poorly in the First Chechen War that after the conflict, General-Lieutenant Aleksandr Galkin, head of the Armour Directorate, convinced the Minister of Defence to never again procure tanks with gas turbine engines (Galkin reversed his position in 1996, claiming that the T-80U was superior to the T-90). After that, T-80 MBTs were never again used to capture cities, and instead, supported infantry squads from a safe distance. Defenders of the T-80 explain that the T-72 performed just as badly in urban fighting in Grozny as the T-80 and that there were two aggravating factors: after the breakup of the Soviet Union, poor funding meant no training for new Russian tank crews, and the tank force entering the city had no infantry support.

Russia did not deploy T-80 tanks in later conflicts such as the 1999 Second Chechen War, the 2008 Russo-Georgian War, or the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
====Russian invasion of Ukraine====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces used T-80 tanks alongside T-72s and T-90s. Some were outfitted with improvised steel grilles on top of turrets, nicknamed &quot;cope cages″ by Internet users. These have been fit reportedly to counter top-attack munitions such as the FGM-148 Javelin and loitering munitions; later into the war the cages were left on and refitted onto more tanks after drone dropped munitions became increasingly prevalent on the battlefield.

According to Oryx, as of 21 February 2025, at least 1094 T-80s of multiple variants have been visually confirmed as destroyed, damaged, abandoned, or captured. Of these, 4 T-80B, 668 T-80BV, 4 T-80BVK, 81 T-80BV Obr. 2022, 102 T-80U, 2 T-80UK, 7 T-80UE-1, 1 T-80UM2, 140 T-80BVM, 53 T-80BVM Obr. 2022, and the remaining 32 are unknown variants.

===Exports===
====United Kingdom====
In 1992, the United Kingdom bought a number of T-80U MBTs for defence research and development. They were not bought officially but through a specially created trading company, which was supposed to deliver them to Morocco. The price of $5 million offered for each tank ensured a lack of suspicion on the part of the Russians. Britain evaluated the tanks on its proving grounds and transferred one to the US where the Americans evaluated it on the Aberdeen Proving Ground. In January 1994, British Minister of State for Defence Procurement Jonathan Aitken confirmed in parliamentary debates that a Russian T-80U tank was imported for &quot;defence research and development purposes&quot;.

====South Korea====

In 1991, South Korea lent $1.47 billion to the Soviet Union under the agreement to promote economic cooperation between the two nations. Russia originally agreed to repay the loan by 1999, but the Russian government requested a delay due to its own circumstances, which led the expected accumulated sum of principal and interest to near $3 billion. Therefore, South Korea launched the Project Brown Bear to collect the debt by purchasing the Russian weapons at a 50% discounted price.

As a result, South Korea purchased 33 T-80Us under Brown Bear I, receiving six in 1996 and 27 in 1997, and two T-80UKs under Brown Bear II in 2005.

When South Korea first acquired the T-80 in the late 1990s, it was the most advanced tank on the Korean Peninsula, superior to the domestic K1 88-Tank in having a larger 125 mm gun to the K1&#x27;s 105 mm. However, as time went on, the K1 was upgraded into the K1A1 and the more advanced K2 Black Panther entered service, while the T-80 changed little since its delivery due to the foreign nature of the design and lack of will to add domestic upgrades. While the South Korean tanks use domestically manufactured ammunition, T-80 shells and most parts must be imported, increasing maintenance costs as the cost of ordering replacement parts kept rising steadily. Although the turbine engine is lighter with better acceleration, it uses more fuel and is less reliable. The interior has been criticized as cramped and gunnery was underperforming via less advanced sights and slower reload speed.

On 21 November 2024, South Korea used two T-80Us as experiments and destroyed them with various types of drone strikes.

====Pakistan====
Ukrainian exports of the T-80UD have been moderately successful. In 1993 and 1995, Ukraine demonstrated the tank to Pakistan, which was looking for a new main battle tank. The tank was tested in Pakistan and in August 1996 Pakistan decided to buy 320 T-80UD tanks from Ukraine for $650 million in two variants: a standard Object 478B and export Object 478BE.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTW 07/09&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks were all supposed to be delivered in 1997. After the first batch of 15 vehicles had been shipped in February 1997, Russia protested that it held the rights to the tank and that Ukraine could not export it. Nearly 70% of T-80UD components were produced outside of Ukraine (mainly in Russia). Under the guise of keeping good relations with India, one of its most important military customers, Russia withheld 2A46-2 125 mm smoothbore guns, cast turrets and other technology, which forced Ukraine to make its tank industry independent. It developed domestic components, including a welded turret, which was in use on the new Ukrainian T-84. Ukraine was able to ship 20 more T-80UD tanks to Pakistan between February and May 1997. These 35 tanks were from Ukrainian Army stocks of 52 T-80UDs; they were built in the Malyshev plant several years before but were not delivered to their original destination. Their abilities were below the standard agreed by both Ukraine and Pakistan. The contract was completed by shipping another 285 Ukrainian T-80UD MBTs between 1997 and early 2002. These had the welded turret and other manufacturing features of the T-84.

====Cyprus====
Cyprus was the first foreign country to officially obtain T-80 tanks. Russia sold 27 T-80U and 14 T-80UK for $174 million to Cyprus in 1996. The tanks arrived in two batches. The first shipment consisted of 27 T-80U MBTs arriving in 1996, while the second batch of 14 T-80UK MBTs arrived in 1997. This significantly improved the abilities of Cypriot army armoured forces; their most potent tank until then was the AMX-30B2. New tanks gave the Cypriot National Guard the edge in a possible confrontation with the Turkish Army in Northern Cyprus. In October 2009 Cyprus ordered another batch of 41 used T-80Us and T-80UKs from Russia for €115 million. Deliveries were completed in the first half of 2011.

====United States====
The US government obtained one T-80U from the United Kingdom. It was evaluated at Eglin Air Force Base. In 2003, Ukraine transferred four T-80UD MBTs to the US.

====Failed export attempts====
Apart from Cyprus and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Russia has tried to export T-80 MBTs to Turkey and Greece, who were looking for new tanks. These two attempts have failed. Sweden regarded the T-80U an alternative for its mechanized brigades in the early 1990s should the Leclerc be adopted for her armoured brigades, but since the new upgraded Leopard 2 (Strv 122) was chosen, Leopard 2A4s (Strv 121) equipped the mechanized brigades as to simplify logistics.

==Description==
The T-80 is similar in layout to the T-64; the driver&#x27;s compartment is on the centre line at the front, the two-man turret is in the centre with the gunner on the left and the commander on the right, and the engine is rear mounted. Overall, its shape is also very similar to the T-64.

=== Mobility ===

The original T-80 design uses a 1,000 hp monobloc gas turbine engine instead of a 750-hp diesel engine of the T-64; later variants of the T-80 reverted to diesel engine usage. The gearbox is different, with five forward and one reverse gear, instead of seven forward and one reverse. Suspension reverts from pneumatic to torsion bar, with six forged steel-aluminium rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, with the tracks driven by rear sprockets.

The tracks are slightly wider and longer than on the T-64 giving lower ground pressure.

=== Armament ===
The turret houses the same 125 mm 2A46 smoothbore gun as the T-72, which can fire regular ordnance and anti-tank guided missiles.

The main gun is fed by the &quot;Korzina&quot; automatic loader. This holds up to 28 rounds of two-part ammunition in a carousel located under the turret floor. Further ammunition is stored in the turret. The ammunition comprises the projectile (APFSDS, HEAT, or HE-Frag), and the propellant charge, or the two-part missile. The autoloader is an effective, reliable, combat tested system that has been in use since the mid-1960s. The propellant charge is held inside a semi-combustible cartridge case made of a highly flammable material, which is consumed in the breech during firing, except for a small metal baseplate.
The autoloader takes between 7.1 and 19.5 seconds to load the main weapon (28 rounds), depending on the initial position of autoloader carousel.

=== Armour ===
The glacis is of laminate armour and the turret is armoured steel, with cavities in the turret cheeks containing either a ceramic filling or non-explosive reactive armour elements.

The T-80&#x27;s armour is composite on the turret and hull, while rubber flaps and sideskirts protect the sides and lower hull. Later T-80 models use explosive reactive armour (Kontakt-1, Kontakt-5 or Relikt) and stronger armour, like the T-80U and T-80UM1. Other protection systems include the Shtora-1 and Arena APS, and the discontinued Drozd APS.

A disadvantage highlighted during combat in Chechnya was the vulnerability of the T-80BV to catastrophic explosion thought to be caused by the vulnerability of stored semi-combustible propellant charges and missiles when contacted by the molten metal jet from the penetration of a HEAT warhead, causing the entire ammunition load to explode. The flaw is mostly related to the spare ammunition in the turret, outside of the autoloader. The autoloaders have some ballistic protection, but only hold roughly half of a T-80s ammunition. During the Chechen war 1994, the Russians were able to reduce their losses by having their tanks carry fewer rounds so that all the ammunition and propellant was stored in the autoloaders This vulnerability may be addressed in later models. When modern Western tank designs changed from non-combustible propellant cartridges to semi-combustible, they tended to separate ammunition stowage from the crew compartment with armoured blast doors, and provided &quot;blow-out&quot; panels to redirect the force and fire of exploding ammunition away from the crew compartment.

==Models==

This section lists the main models of the T-80, built in the Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine, with the dates they entered service.

Command tanks with more radio equipment have &quot;K&quot; added to their designation for &quot;komandirskiy&quot; (&quot;command&quot;), for example, &quot;T-80BK&quot; is the command version of the T-80B. Versions with reactive armour have &quot;V&quot; added, for &quot;vzryvnoy&quot; (&quot;explosive&quot;), for example &quot;T-80BV&quot;. Lower cost versions with no missile ability have a figure &quot;1&quot; added, as &quot;T-80B1&quot;.
* T-80 / Object 219 (1976): Initial model, with 1,000 hp gas turbine engine, coincidence rangefinder, and no missile capability. This model does not have fittings for explosive reactive armour. The turret is from the T-64A, and thus retains the use of the old coincidence rangefinder. Characteristics of this type are the V-shaped water deflector on the front glacis, coincidence rangefinder in front of the commander&#x27;s cupola, and Luna searchlight mounted in the same position as a T-64. Around 250 were produced, as the tank&#x27;s armour was essentially obsolete when introduced. Turret vs APFSDS – 380 mm, hull vs APFSDS – 500 mm (without reactive armour). This was, in effect, a pre-production model. It reportedly was fitted with an early version of the Shtora APS.
* T-80B / Object 219R (1978): This model had a new turret with improved composite armour, laser rangefinder, new fire-control system, new autoloader and missile launcher system capable of firing 9M112-1 Kobra antitank guided missile through the gun barrel. An improved, 1,100 hp, engine was added in 1980, a new gun in 1982. A night sight TPNZ-49 in active mode reached 1,300 m and a passive – 850 m.
* T-80BV (1985): T-80BV (model 1985) is a T-80B upgraded with Kontakt-1 ERA on turret and hull. Smoke discharges are re-positioned to make a room on the turret for ERA. There is a new gun 2A46M-1 with 9K112 Kobra system capable of firing improved 9M112M Kobra ATGM through gun barrel.
T-80BV also introduced a new 5 part armour array on the hull unlike the old 3 part T-80B. T-80B&#x27;s were upgraded with appliqué armour 30mm high hardness steel plate to increase its protection to the same level.
* Object 219A: Early T-80U (Object 219AS) variant. It has the T-80U&#x27;s turret, but not the Kontakt-5 ERA. Instead, it uses the old Kontakt-1/3 system; some 219As did not have ERA at all. Often misnamed &quot;T-80A&quot;.
* T-80U / Object 219AS (1985): Further development with a better turret, Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armour, improved gunner&#x27;s sight. There is the same gun 2A46M-1 as on T-80BV but with a new 9K120 Svir system which allows firing 9M119 Svir ATGM. In 1990, a new 1,250 hp engine was installed. Overall protection with Kontakt-5 against APFSDS or HEAT is 780/1,320 mm RHAe. 9K119M with antitank guided missile 9M119M installed since 1990. 
* T-80UD Bereza (1987): Ukrainian diesel version with 1,000 hp 6TD engine and remote-controlled antiaircraft machine gun.
:* T-80UDK – T-80UD command tank. Prototype only.
:* Object 478BK – T-80UD with a welded turret.
:* Object 478BE – T-80UD sold to Pakistan.
:* Object 478DU2 – Development of the T-80UD, that brought about a family of Ukrainian MBTs including T-84, T-84U, T-84 Oplot, and T-84 Yatagan models.
* T-80UK: Commander version equipped with Shtora-1 APS, thermal imaging night sight TO1-PO2T (detection range, target classification range = 6,400; 4,600 meters at night), new atmospheric parameter sensor, R-163U and R-163K radio stations, TNA-4 navigation system, HE shell remote detonation system, AB-1-P28 autonomous power plant. Adopted by the army in the 1990s.
*T-80UE: Export version similar to T-80UK version, with Shtora-1 APS and other improvements, no orders received.
*T-80UE-1: Not to be confused with the attempted export version T-80UE, this version is made by mating T-80UD turret with T-80BV hull (with some improvements to bring the hull to T-80U level, as Kontakt-5 ERA for example).
* T-80UM (1995): Russian version, with new Buran thermal imaging sight in place of the Luna IR.
* Object 478BK (1995): Further Ukrainian development of T-80UD with 1,200 hp diesel and new welded turret.
* T-80UM-1 &quot;Bars&quot; (1997): Russian prototype with new Arena active protection system; bricks all around the turret visible on the outer side are Arena APS projectile casings, while Kontakt-5 ERA bricks lay behind them on the front part of the turret.
* T-80BVD (2002): KMDB&#x27;s upgrade standard for Ukrainian T-80BVs. Changes include the 6TD diesel engine, remote-controlled commander&#x27;s machine gun, and better optics. None were produced.
* T-80UM-2: Russian experimental prototype with the older KAZT Drozd-1 active protection system. In 2022, the only known prototype was destroyed by Ukrainian forces some time in March. This has been visually confirmed via photos taken by Ukrainian soldiers as well as the 3rd party monitoring site, Oryx.
* Black Eagle or Object 640 (prototype, cancelled): Two Russian prototypes were shown at trade shows, with a longer chassis and extra pair of road wheels, and a very large turret with redesigned layout, separate ammunition compartment and new ERA array.
* T-80BVM (2017): Features &quot;Relikt&quot; ERA, Irtysh fire control, Sosna-U gunner&#x27;s sight (as on T-90A), an improved 125mm gun 2A46M-4, 9K119M Refleks-M missile system, upgraded gas turbine engine and upgrades of various other systems. The tank also has a new autoloader capable of firing the depleted uranium 3BM59 APFSDS shell and the tungsten 3BM60. A new contract for 50 tanks was signed in August 2020 and a new one in August 2022. As of August 2024, deliveries are underway.
*Ukrainian modernized T-80BV: A Ukrainian T-80BV modernization that gives the tank upgrades similar to the T-64BV zr.2017, the official designation of this variant is unknown.
