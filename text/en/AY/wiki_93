<text>Pure Land Buddhism or the Pure Land School () is a broad branch of Mahayana Buddhism focused on achieving rebirth in a Pure Land. It is one of the most widely practiced traditions of Buddhism in East Asia. It is also known as &quot;Nembutsu school&quot; or the &quot;Lotus School&quot;. East Asian Pure Land mainly relies on three main Mahayana scriptures: the &quot;Sutra of Amitayus&quot;, the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Amitabha Sutra&quot;. 

The Pure Land tradition is primarily focused on achieving rebirth in a Buddha&#x27;s &quot;pure land&quot;, a superior place to spiritually train for full Buddhahood, where one can meet a Buddha face to face and study under them without any of the distractions or fears of our world. Since it is much easier to attain enlightenment in a pure land, many Mahayana Buddhists strive to be reborn in one. The most popular one today is Sukhavati (&quot;Land of Bliss&quot;), the pure land of Buddha Amitābha, though some Buddhists may also aspire to be reborn in other pure lands (such as Maitreya&#x27;s and Medicine Guru&#x27;s). Although Buddhas are venerated in Pure Land and are seen as savior-like figures, the tradition clearly distinguishes itself from theistic religions, due to its roots in the classic Mahayana understanding of Buddhahood and bodhisattvas, as well as the Buddhist doctrines of emptiness and mind-only.

The most distinctive feature of East Asian Pure Land traditions is that it offers ordinary people (even the unlearned and the unethical) hope that they may attain the stage of non-retrogression and eventually Buddhahood, no matter how bad their karma may be. In East Asian Pure Land, this is most commonly accomplished through the practice of mindfulness of the Buddha, which is called &quot;niànfó&quot; (Chinese: 念佛, &quot;Buddha recitation&quot;, Japanese: ) and entails reciting the name of Amitabha (Chinese: &quot;Āmítuófó&quot;, Japanese: ). However, Pure Land Buddhism may also includes numerous other practices which are done alongside Buddha recitation, such as keeping Buddhist precepts, reciting sutras, visualization, and making offerings.

Pure Land oriented practices and concepts form an important component of the Mahāyāna Buddhist traditions of China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, the Himalayas and Inner Asian regions such as Tibet. Some East Asian traditions are exclusively Pure Land oriented, especially the Japanese sects like Jōdo-shū and Jōdo Shinshū. In Tibetan Buddhism, prayers and practices which aim at rebirth in a Buddha-field are also a popular religious orientation, especially among laypersons. 

== Terminology ==
The English term &quot;Pure Land Buddhism&quot; can refer to two religious phenomena. One referent of the term &quot;Pure Land&quot; is a collective term for all practices and teachings having to do with a Buddha&#x27;s &quot;pure land&quot; or buddha-field (Sanskrit: &quot;buddhakṣetra&quot;). This usage corresponds with the Chinese term &quot;Pure land Dharma gate&quot; (淨土法門, pinyin: jìngtǔ fǎmén) which refers to a spiritual practice or a specific approach to the (Buddhist) Dharma. Since this is a generic term for all &quot;pure land methods&quot;, it technically includes practices in many different Buddhist schools, including Tiantai, Tibetan Buddhism, and so on, and not just to those of &quot;Pure Land schools&quot; or sects.

&quot;Pure Land Buddhism&quot; is also commonly used to refer to various separate Pure Land traditions which take Pure land practice as the central element of their teaching, sometimes exclusively so. In Chinese Buddhism, Pure Land is often thought of as its own zōng (school), like Zen and so forth. Thus, this usage corresponds to the East Asian term &quot;Pure Land school&quot; (; ; ; ). In Japanese Buddhism, the term more commonly refers to specific institutions like Jōdo-shū and Jōdo Shinshū.

Another common name for the Pure Land school in Chinese Buddhism is &quot;Lotus School&quot; (liánzōng 蓮宗), drawing its name from the various Pure land Lotus Societies, the first of which was founded by Huiyuan (334–416). In Japanese Buddhism meanwhile, another name for the Pure Land schools is &quot;Nembutsu school&quot;.

When referring to traditions which focus on rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha (Jp: Amida), scholars may also use the term &quot;Amidism&quot;. Similarly, traditional sources do sometimes speak of &quot;Amida&#x27;s Dharma.&quot;

===Mindfulness of the Buddha===

Teachings which focus on seeking rebirth in a buddha-field (&quot;buddhakṣetra&quot;) were first developed in Indian Mahayana Buddhist Sutras, and were very popular in Kashmir and Central Asia, where they might have originated. The methods taught in the Mahayana sources which discuss &quot;buddhakṣetras&quot; are generally devotional Mahayana forms of the classic Buddhist practice known as mindfulness of the Buddha (Skt. &quot;&quot;). Andrew Skilton argues that the intermingling of Mahāyāna teachings with Sarvāstivādin meditation traditions in Kashmir led to the Buddha meditation practices which later influenced Pure Land in China.

Remembrance of the Buddha is an early Buddhist practice which was taught in the Early Buddhist Texts. According to Paul Harrison, the term &quot;anusmṛti&quot; means &#x27;recollection&#x27;, &#x27;remembrance&#x27;, and, by extension, &#x27;calling to mind&#x27;, &#x27;keeping in mind&#x27; (cf. smriti, commonly translated as &#x27;mindfulness&#x27;). Buddha recollection was part of a group of &quot;anusmṛti&quot; practices. In the &quot;Anguttara Nikaya&quot;, one finds six &quot;anusmṛtis:&quot; the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, sila (moral observance), caga (liberality), and the devata (gods). In the &quot;Sutta Nipata&quot;, a Brahmin follower of the Buddha, named Pingiya, notes that even though his physical state does not allow him to be with the Buddha personally,there is no moment for me, however small, that is spent away from Gotama, from this universe of wisdom, this world of understanding ... with constant and careful vigilance it is possible for me to see him with my mind as clearly as with my eyes, in night as well as day. And since I spend my nights revering him, there is not, to my mind, a single moment spent away from him.The &quot;Ekottara-agama&quot; (EA) also contains various unique passages on buddhānusmṛti. EA III, 1 (Taisho Vol. II, p. 554a7-b9) states that buddhānusmṛti can lead to the unconditioned, nirvana, as well as magic power. This sutra explains that a monk should sit down and &quot;contemplates the image of the Tathagatha without taking his eyes off it...he calls to mind the qualities of the Tathagatha.&quot; These qualities which one contemplates include his vajra body, ten powers, his moral qualities, samadhis and wisdom (prajña).

According to Paul Williams, this practice of &quot;Buddha mindfulness&quot; gained further importance within Mahayana Buddhism, which had an expanded cosmology that held that there were infinite numbers of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas living in infinite Buddhafields throughout the universe. The practice of mindfulness of the Buddhas was seen as a way to contact these living Buddhas and attain awakening. For example, the &quot;Saptaśatikā&quot; (700 line) &quot;Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; states that through the &#x27;Single Deed Samadhi&#x27; one can quickly attain enlightenment:The meditators should live in seclusion, cast away discursive thoughts, not cling to the appearance of things, concentrate their minds on a Buddha, and recite his name single-mindedly. They should keep their bodies erect and, facing the direction of that Buddha, meditate upon him continuously. If they can maintain mindfulness of the Buddha without interruption from moment to moment, then they will be able to see all the Buddhas of the past, present, and future right in each moment. A related idea associated with this Mahayana Buddhology was that through proper conduct, worship, and meditation, one could attain rebirth in the Buddha-field of one of these Buddhas.

====Buddha-field concept====
In the more expansive Mahayana cosmology, there are an infinite number of Buddhas, and each one has a field of activity where they teach and guide sentient beings to awakening. This teaching activity, which is done out of a sense of great compassion, is how Buddhas and bodhisattvas &quot;purify&quot; their Buddha-fields. Indeed, the very existence of a buddha-field depends on the acts of a bodhisattva on their path to Buddhahood. According to Jan Nattier, these ideas may have developed out of meditative experiences which provided certain meditators with &quot;visions of a universe far more vast than had previously been supposed&quot;, with many world systems, some of which contained other Buddhas. This introduced the possibility that one could be reborn in these Buddha-fields.

Indian Mahayanists also held that these buddha-fields had a splendor and purity that matched the purity of the Buddha&#x27;s mind. Sentient beings who are reborn in these pure buddha-fields due to their good karma also contribute to the development of a Buddha-field, as can bodhisattvas who are able to travel there. These buddha-fields are therefore powerful places which are very advantageous to spiritual progress.

According to Jan Nattier, the wish to be reborn in a Buddhafield may have become popular in India due to the common idea that the bodhisattva path was very difficult and entailed much suffering and self-sacrifice. It also was seen as lasting a very long time, in some formulations, it lasts three incalculable eons (asamkhyeya kalpas), which would mean spending millions of lifetimes on the path.

Not all buddha-fields appear as perfectly &#x27;pure&#x27;, and some Mahayana sutras speak of three kinds of buddha-fields: impure, pure, and mixed. Thus, an impure buddha-field (like this world, called Sahā—&quot;the world to be endured&quot;—which is Sakyamuni Buddha&#x27;s field), includes non-Buddhists, immoral people, and so on. On the other hand, purified buddha-fields, like Amitabha&#x27;s, are described as beautiful places, covered in beryl and gold, without any filth or evil. However, different Mahayana texts explain the nature of Sakyamuni&#x27;s buddhafield in different ways. According to Paul Williams, some sutras adopt the view that Sakyamuni&#x27;s buddhafield is impure because, due to his vast compassion, he works to help all beings, even the most impure. Thus, while some Buddhas like Amitabha, teach the beings who aspire to be born in their pure buddha-fields, other Buddhas (like Sakyamuni) &quot;vow to appear as Buddhas in impure realms, tainted Buddha Fields, out of their great compassion.&quot; This is the view of Sakyamuni&#x27;s buddha-field which is found in the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, which according to Williams &quot;sought to restore Sakyamuni to pre-eminence in the face of Pure Land cults centred on Amitayus and Aksobhya.&quot;

According to the &quot;Vimalakirti sutra,&quot; this seemingly impure world, Sakyamuni&#x27;s buddha-field, is actually a purified buddha-field. It only &quot;appears&quot; to be impure because the minds of sentient beings perceive it to be impure. As Williams explains, the view of the &quot;Vimalakirti sutra&quot; is that: &quot;The impurity that we see is the result of impure awareness, and also the Buddha&#x27;s compassion in creating a world within which impure beings can grow. Thus the real way to attain a Pure Land is to purify one&#x27;s own mind. Put another way, we are already in the Pure Land if we but knew it. Whatever the realm, if it is inhabited by people with enlightened pure minds then it is a Pure Land.&quot;

There was never any Indian &quot;school&quot; focused on this method, as it was considered one of the many goals and methods of Indian Mahayana Buddhism. There is also very little evidence for an Amitabha cult per se in India according to Williams. Furthermore, the East Asian term &quot;pure land&quot; or &quot;purified ground&quot; (Chinese: &quot;jìngtǔ&quot;) is not a translation of any particular Indic term, and Indian authors almost always used the term &quot;buddhakṣetra.&quot; However, it is possible the Chinese term is related to the Sanskrit term &quot;pariśuddha&quot;-&quot;buddhakṣetra&quot; (purified buddhafield).

===Mahayana sources===
====&quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot;====
The &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot; gives an early description of the practice of reciting the name of Amitābha as a meditation method, although it does not enumerate any vows of Amitābha or the qualities of his Buddha-field of Sukhāvatī. This sutra is one of the earliest Mahayana sutras translated into Chinese (it was eventually translated into Chinese four times). The sutra focuses on the &quot;pratyutpanna-buddha-sammukhavasthita-samadhi&quot; which means &quot;the samadhi of the one who stands (&quot;avasthita&quot;) face-to-face with, or in the presence of (&quot;sammukha&quot;), the present (&quot;pratyutpanna&quot;) Buddhas.&quot;

This sutra also contains the earliest textual reference to Amitabha, though the context of the reference makes it clear that the &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi&quot; is not exclusively for meeting Amitabha but can be used to meet any present Buddha. According to the &quot;Pratyutpanna,&quot; a practitioner must first strictly keep to the Buddhist moral code and then enter solitary retreat. In the retreat, they concentrate their thoughts on the Buddha Amitabha and thus practice buddhānusmṛti. They contemplate his qualities (such as being a Tathagata, a knower of the world, teacher of devas and humans) and his body, with the thirty two marks of the great man and a golden color, which shines brightly, sitting on a throne and teaching the Dharma. This practice is to be done for days or even three months, until they have visions of the Buddha (either while awake during the day or in a dream at night) at which point they may worship and receive teachings from Amitabha. Thus they can become very learned (&quot;bahusruta&quot;) bodhisattvas in this way. The sutra also states:According to the sutra, these visions are &quot;not&quot; said to be the result of the divine eye (or other magical powers), instead the Buddhas appear to the meditator&#x27;s vision.

The sutra also seeks to explain how it is possible to have these visions and what their nature is like. According to the sutra, the nature of the visions are dream-like and the sutra states that they are possible because all phenomena are empty and made by mind. According to the &quot;Pratyutpanna,&quot; these visions are possible because: &quot;this triple world is nothing but thought. That is because however I discriminate things [Skt. vikalpayati, mentally construct], so they appear.&quot; The sutra also links this visionary samadhi with the realization of emptiness, stating that &quot;he who obtains the samadhi of emptiness by thus concentrating on the Tathagata without apprehending him, he is known as one who calls to mind the Buddha.&quot; Thus, one should not think that these Buddhas actually come from somewhere or go anywhere, they are to be understood as similar to empty space and as not existing in some substantial or objective way, since they are empty, like all dharmas, of inherent existence (&quot;svabhavena sunya&quot;).

====&quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtras&quot;====

The two most important Indian sutras for the East Asian Pure Land tradition are the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, and the &quot;Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;. These sutras describe Amitābha (whose name means Immeasurable Light), and his pure buddha-field of Sukhavati (which is said to excel all buddhafields). They also discuss his various bodhisattva vows, which focus on his buddhafield as well as discussing how he attained Buddhahood. As Williams writes, the Longer sutra also states that &quot;those who sincerely trust in Amitabha and desire to be reborn in his Pure Land need &quot;call on the name&quot; of Amitabha only 10 times and they will be reborn there – provided they have not committed any of the five great crimes of murdering father or mother, or an Arhat, harming a Buddha, or causing schism in the sangha, or have slandered the Dharma.&quot;

According to the longer sutra, those who wish to be reborn in Sukhavati should give rise to bodhicitta, meditate on Amitabha, hear and recite his name, pray to reborn in Sukhavati, and accumulate merit. Then at the time of death, Amitabha will appear to those who have sincerely practiced and wished to be reborn there and lead them to Sukhavati. Bodhisattvas who reach Sukhavati from other lands will also be able to enter the stage of &quot;one more birth&quot; (left until Buddhahood) and they will also be able to be reborn from Sukhavati into other worlds to help beings. From Sukhavati, beings will also be able to visit other buddha-fields to see many other Buddhas. Thus, this buddha-field makes it much easier for someone to attain enlightenment.

According to Julian Pas, the long and short &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; sūtras were composed during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, though he considers the smaller &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; to be earlier. Andrew Skilton writes that the descriptions of Sukhāvatī given in the &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; sūtras suggests that these descriptions were originally used for meditation: &quot;This land, called Sukhāvatī or &quot;blissful,&quot; is described in great detail, in a way that suggests that the sūtras were to be used as guides to visualization meditation, and also gives an impression of a magical world of intense visual and sonorous delight.&quot; According to Nakamura, the &quot;Longer&quot; &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; might have been influenced by the Lokottaravāda school, since the work has many elements in common with the &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;.

In the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, Gautama Buddha begins by describing to his attendant Ānanda a past life of the Buddha Amitābha. He states that in a past life, Amitābha was once a king who renounced his kingdom, and became a monastic bodhisattva named Dharmākara (&quot;Dharma Storehouse&quot;) and gave rise to the aspiration to achieve Buddhahood in order to help all beings. He also had the aspiration to create the most perfect buddha-field as the ideal place to reach awakening. Under the guidance of the Buddha Lokeśvararāja (&quot;World Sovereign King&quot;), innumerable buddha-lands throughout the ten directions were revealed to Dharmākara. After meditating for five eons on how to array the perfect buddha-land, he then made a great series of forty-eight vows, and through his great merit, created the realm of Sukhāvatī (&quot;Ultimate Bliss&quot;).

Charles B. Jones describes some of the most important elements of these vows as follows:this buddha-land will be accessible to all beings who aspire to be reborn there even for &quot;ten moments of thought&quot; (vow 18), cultivate all virtues (vow 19), and, upon hearing his future buddha-name Amitābha, dedicate the merit of their practices to gaining rebirth (vow 20). He will personally appear to such beings at the moment of death (vow 19). Once born in his buddha-land, they will have many of the abilities and bodily features of a fully awakened buddha, such as the divine eye, the divine ear, and the ability to read others&#x27; minds (vows 6, 7, 8), and the 32 bodily marks of a buddha (vow 21). The requirements that beings first perfect all virtues and attain such abilities and features before gaining rebirth might lead one to think that they are effectively buddhas upon arrival, but other vows make clear that the purpose of rebirth in this buddha-land is the acquisition of buddhahood. Beings born there are promised limitless time to practice (vow 15), they will never perish and revert to a lower rebirth (vow 2), and they will assuredly achieve buddhahood(vow 11). The land itself is to be so clear and pure that it perfectly reflects all other world systems (vow 31). All the accoutrements of the land will be so finely wrought as to be unperceivable (vow 27), and the land itself, with all its trees and buildings, will be adorned with all seven kinds of brilliant jewel (vow 32).The sutra then states that Amitabha has achieved Buddhahood and hence these vows have been fulfilled. It also describes in detail the nature of the &quot;Land of Peace and Bliss&quot;, its beauty, magnificence and comfortable features, as well as the way that the various features of the land teach the Dharma to all beings there.

The longer sutra also mentions that beings with little attainment or virtue can reach the Pure Land, and states that how and where they will be born once inside the Pure Land is correlated with their level of attainment. Only those who have committed the Five Heinous Deeds or have slandered the dharma are barred from the Pure Land according to the long sutra.

====Other important sutras====

The &quot;Akṣobhya-vyūha&quot; is the main source for the tradition of the Buddha Akṣobhya and his buddhafield of Abhirati. It is also one of the earliest known Mahayana sutras. According to this sutra, Akṣobhya took various vows to follow the path to Buddhahood many aeons ago. Due to the great merit generated by these vows for countless lifetimes, Akṣobhya was able to create a purified buddha-field, a peaceful and blissful place where there is no misery, hunger, or pain and where all beings accomplish the ten good actions. Nattier notes that this sutra does not recommend Buddhahood for all beings in Abhirati, instead some are striving for Arhatship and will attain it there. Also, in this sutra, bodhisattvas do not attain Buddhahood in Abhirati, instead, they advance on the path until ready and then they are born in another world which lacks the Buddhadharma to attain Buddhahood there.

Akṣobhya and his buddha-field are also discussed in the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, and the descriptions in this sutra match that of the &quot;Akṣobhya-vyūha&quot;. Nattier notes that this buddha-field is similar to our world system, with a human realm, heaven realms and a buddha-realm. However, it lacks the three lower realms and there is little suffering even in the human realm, which is a peaceful place without any need to work nor buying or selling, since food magically appears to those who need it.

According to the &quot;Akṣobhya-vyūha&quot;, attaining rebirth in Abhirati is difficult. Nattier notes that &quot;a tremendous amount of merit is required&quot;, and conversely, no specific devotional act towards Akṣobhya is required. One must cultivate the proper roots of merit and purify one&#x27;s conduct. Those who wish to be born in Abhirati should vow to be reborn there, dedicate all their merit to be reborn in Abhirati, not be selfish, learn meditation and meet with holy people. They should practice visualizing the Buddhas in their buddha-fields and vow to be like them.

The &quot;Vimalakīrti Sutra&quot; is a text which mainly focuses on wisdom, but it includes various discussions the nature of our world (which is Śākyamuni&#x27;s buddha-field), and how it appears impure and yet is pure. This discussion was widely quoted by later Chinese Pure Land sources. The sutra also contains a chapter in which Akṣobhya&#x27;s buddha-field plays a key role. The &quot;Vimalakīrti Sutra&quot; states that the purification of a buddha-land happens through the purification of our minds: &quot;if the bodhisattva wishes to acquire a pure land, he must purify his mind. When the mind is pure, the buddha-land will be pure&quot;. When the Buddha&#x27;s disciple Śāriputra questions the nature of this world which appears defiled, the Buddha states that it only appears impure to certain beings since their minds are impure. The Buddha then touches the ground with his toe and the whole world appears in a beautiful and radiant way to Śāriputra. The Buddha then states that his Buddha-field has always been pure.

In contrast to this view, the &quot;Nirvana Sutra&quot; states that Buddha Śākyamuni has his own Pure Land which is not this world, but is many worlds away and is called &quot;Unsurpassable&quot; (Wúshèng 無勝). The Buddha manifests from this Pure Land into our world in order to teach the Dharma.

The &quot;Bhaiṣajyaguru Sūtra&quot; briefly describes the buddhafield of the Buddha Bhaiṣajyaguru (Medicine Guru), the Buddha of healing, as well as the vows that he made as a bodhisattva. His buddhafield is similar to Akṣobhya&#x27;s, without pain and totally clean and beautiful. The sutra may have been composed outside of India (perhaps Central Asia) and later introduced into the subcontinent. This Buddha became quite popular in East Asia due to the belief that he could cure disease and enhance longevity.

The &quot;Mañjuśrībuddhakṣetraguṇavyūha&quot; discusses the future buddha-field of Mañjuśrī.

====In Mahayana treatises====
Teachings and practices related to buddha-fields are discussed in various Mahayana treatises, including some that have been attributed to Indian masters like Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu. A text attributed to Nagarjuna, the *&quot;Dasabhumikavibhāsā&quot; (Chinese: &quot;Shí zhù pípóshā lùn&quot; 十住毘婆沙論, T.1521) which only exists in Chinese, contains a chapter which states that there are many gates to Buddhist practice and that the easy path is that of being constantly mindful of the Buddhas, especially Amitabha. This chapter (number 9, &quot;Chapter on Easy Practice&quot;) which focuses on how birth in Amitābha&#x27;s Pure Land is a relatively easier path to follow was widely quoted by East Asian Pure Land authors. The authorship of this text has been disputed by some scholars, including Akira Hirakawa.

The Indian Yogacara master Asanga also discusses the idea of rebirth in a buddha-field in his &quot;Mahāyānasaṃgraha.&quot; According to Asanga, sutra statements which say that one may be reborn in a buddha-field by simply wishing to or by simply reciting a Buddha&#x27;s name should not be taken literally. Instead, the Buddha&#x27;s intent in saying such things was to encourage the lazy and indolent that were not capable of practicing the Dharma properly.

Another Yogacara master, Asanga&#x27;s brother Vasubandhu, is credited with the authorship of the short &quot;Verses of Aspiration: An Upadeśa on the Amitāyus Sūtra&quot; (&quot;Wúliángshòujīng yōupótíshè yuànshēng jié&quot; 無量壽經優婆提舍願生偈, T.1524) which is a commentary on the shorter &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; which describes a five part practice which may have been used as a visualization meditation ritual. Williams notes that the authorship of this work by Vasubadhu is questioned by some modern scholars&quot;.&quot; The text is known for its focus on faith or trust.

The &quot;Dà zhìdù lùn&quot; (&quot;Great discourse on the Perfection of Wisdom&quot;, T.1509), translated by Kumārajīva and his team of scholars, is a large commentarial work on the Perfection of Wisdom. Its 92nd section (juǎn) is entitled &quot;Chapter on Purifying a Buddha-field&quot; and contains much discussion on the nature of buddha-fields and how to attain rebirth there.

==China==


===Sutras===
The Mahayana Sutras which teach Pure Land methods were brought from the Gandhāra region to China as early as 147 CE, when the Indo-Kushan monk Lokakṣema began translating the first Buddhist sūtras into Chinese. They include the &quot;Akṣobhya-vyūha&quot; (centered on Abhirati, the buddha-field of the Buddha Akṣohhya) and the &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot; (which discusses the buddhafield of Amitabha). The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from the Gāndhārī language, a Prakrit. There are also images of Amitābha with the bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta which were made in Gandhāra during the Kushan era.

One of the earliest Chinese followers of Amitabha was Zhi Dun (314–366), a Neo-Daoist scholar turned Buddhist monk. One of his eulogies expresses his faith in Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land. Somewhat later, the Kuchan master Kumārajīva (344–413 CE) translated the &quot;Smaller Sukhāvatī-vyūha&quot; (T 366) and other Chinese translators also rendered the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; into Chinese, the most popular being Buddhabhadra&#x27;s c. 359–429 CE. Over time, the three principal sūtras for the Chinese Pure Land tradition became the &quot;Longer The Amitāyus Sutra,&quot; &quot;Amitāyus Contemplation Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Shorter Amitābha Sūtra&quot;.

Regarding the &quot;Amitayurdhyana Sutra (Guan-wuliangshou-jing, Sutra on the Visualization of [the Buddha] Immeasurable Life),&quot; modern scholars now consider it to be a Chinese composition. No Sanskrit original has been discovered, no Tibetan translations exists and the text also shows Chinese influences, including references to earlier translations of Chinese Pure Land texts. Modern scholars generally accept that the text describes a meditation which was practiced in Central Asia, but with Chinese additions.

These three Pure land sutras (the Long and Short &quot;Sukhāvatī-vyūhas&quot; and the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot;) are seen as the main &quot;three pure land sutras&quot; in East Asian Pure Land Buddhism and they are the main sutra sources for Pure Land doctrine in East Asia. In Chinese Pure Land Buddhism, these three are combined with two more sutra chapters and a reinterpreted South Asian treatise to form a canon of six foundational Pure Land texts. The other three sources are:

* &quot;The Chapter of the Practices and Vows of Bodhisattva Samantabhadhra&quot; from the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;
* &quot;The Chapter on the Perfect and Complete Realization of Mahasthamaprapta&quot; from the &quot;Surangama Sutra&quot;
* Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Pure Land&quot; (&quot;Jìngtǔ lùn&quot; 浄土論), also known as &quot;The Rebirth Treatise&quot; (往生论).

In addition to these sutras and treatise, many other Mahāyāna texts also feature Amitābha, and a total of 290 such works have been identified in the Taishō Tripiṭaka.

===Early period===
The Pure Land teachings first became prominent in China with the founding of Donglin Temple at Mount Lu () by Huiyuan () in 402. As a young man, Huiyuan practiced Daoism, but felt the theories of immortality to be vague and unreliable, and unrepresentative of the ultimate truth. Instead, he turned to Buddhism and became a monk under Dao&#x27;an (). Later he founded a monastery at the top of Mount Lu and invited well-known literati to study and practice Buddhism there, where they formed the White Lotus Society ( ). He also corresponded with Kumārajīva.

Huiyuan and the Mount Lu community focused on the practice of mindfulness of the Buddha Amitabha as taught in the &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra&quot;. Huiyuan mainly practiced this method so as to develop samadhi and have a vision of the Buddha Amitābha in the present life and receive teachings from him. The members of the White Lotus also vowed to help each other reach &quot;the spirit realm&quot; or &quot;the west&quot;. Today, Mount Lu is regarded as being among the most sacred religious sites of the Pure Land Buddhist tradition, and the site of the first Pure Land gathering.

However, scholars like Charles B. Jones have questioned whether Huiyuan was actually interested in nianfo practice as a way to gain rebirth in the Pure Land. He notes that his letters to Kumārajīva have no mention of this goal and that Huiyuan&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Gāo sēng zhuàn&quot; (&quot;Biographies of eminent monks&quot;, T.2059, circa 519) do not name or describe the Pure Land of Sukhavati using classic Buddhist descriptions one finds in the sutras. Instead, this &quot;spirit realm&quot; shows Daoist influences. Hence, Jones does not see Huiyuan as being an actual devotee of Pure Land Buddhism, but instead as simply a Buddhist who practiced nianfo. Huiyuan did praise nianfo, and he is recorded as saying that &quot;the nianfo samadhi is preeminent for height of merit and ease of practice.&quot; Whatever the case, during the later course of Pure Land Buddhism, Huiyan began to be seen as a patriarch of Pure Land Buddhism who had achieved rebirth in the Pure Land and had visions of Amitabha.

Another influential figure during this time was the Dilun school master Jingying Huiyuan (523–592), the first Chinese author to write commentaries to the &quot;Amitayus Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot;. His commentaries remained influential in later times. Huiyuan labeled the Pure Land teaching of the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot; “the dharma wheel of the sudden teaching” since it allows ordinary people to enter the stage of non-retrogression. The practice of mindfulness of the Buddha was also taught by the very influential figure of Tiāntái Buddhism, Zhìyǐ (538–597). His &quot;Móhē zhǐguān,&quot; teaches the Constantly Walking Samadhi (cháng xíng sānmèi) which is based on the &quot;Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra.&quot; This practice entails circumambulating an altar while visualizing a detailed image of Amitabha and sonorously reciting the name Amitabha while also working to realize the empty nature of the visualization. This practice was done for ninety days.

The rise in popularity of Pure Land Buddhism may have been due to the popular idea that human beings were becoming incapable of practicing the Buddha Dharma properly since the world was entering into a decadent or latter age of the Dharma. According to this view, humans need the help of Amitābha Buddha to reach awakening, since in our time, the classic bodhisattva path is just too difficult. Pure land ideas thus gave people hope in a difficult world and made the Buddhist path seem relatively easier than the classic Mahayana bodhisattva path which was held to last for countless aeons (kalpas). Another possible reason why this tradition grew in popularity in China was that it addressed an important Chinese concern, the search for immortality (the name of the Buddha Amitayus means &quot;Immeasurable Life&quot;).

According to Charles B. Jones, early Pure Land authors in China discussed and debated three different views on the Pure Land: (1) ordinary people could be born in Sukhāvatī, (2) only advanced bodhisattvas could reach Sukhāvatī, (3) Pure Land practitioners attained whatever kind of land corresponded to the purity of their minds. Over time, view 1 won out over the others, so much so that according to Jones, the most essential element of the Pure Land teaching in China is the very idea that non-elite common folk could attain the highest Buddhist goals through simple practices based on Amitabha. This movement was widely embraced by ordinary laypersons. It received a mixed response from the Chinese Buddhist community at large and led to generations of Pure land writings and apologetics.

===Tanluan and Daochuo===
Before the 7th century, the archeological evidence is quite small for the worship of Amitabha in China. Williams notes that there was very little devotion to Amitabha in China during the third and fourth centuries. However, during the 7th century, there were over 144 images of Amitabha and Avalokitesvara erected in China. According to Williams, &quot;these changes occur during the collective lifetimes of Tanluan, Daochuo (Tao-ch’o; 562–645), and Shandao (Shan- tao; 613–681).&quot;

The Pure Land teachings and meditation methods based on mindfulness of the Buddha (reciting the name of Amitābha and visualizing his form), quickly spread throughout China due to the work of figures like these three patriarchs. It is also in the writings of these patriarchs that the idea that ordinary people could reach the Pure Land of Amitabha was promoted and defended through reliance on classic Buddhist doctrine.

The first patriarch is Tanluan, known for his commentary on the &quot;*Sukhavativyuhopadesa&quot;. Tanluan was skeptical about the possibility of spiritual growth at the time that he lived. He argues that it is too difficult now to practice the bodhisattva path relying on one&#x27;s own power (or self-power, through study and meditation) and instead one needed to rely on &quot;other power&quot;, that is the power of a Buddha like Amitabha. According to Tanluan, through faith in this other power, one can attain enlightenment relatively easily. Tanluan describes a detailed meditation of visualizing the Buddha Amitabha and reciting his name with sincere faith. He saw the name of the Buddha as a kind of spell which has the power to connect us with the wisdom of the Buddha and his inconceivable realm (&quot;acintya-dhātu&quot;).

This practice has the power to purify the mind of all evil tendencies, since it calls on the power of Amitabha Buddha. Thus, even the worst of persons can be saved through this method. According to Tanluan, once one reaches the Pure Land and achieve awakening there, one&#x27;s purpose must be to manifest in this world as bodhisattvas in order to help others. Tanluan cites over twenty sutras and over a dozen treatises in his main commentary, including eighty one references to the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; and twenty one to the work of Sengchao. Tanluan preached his Pure Land doctrine, which had great potential for mass appeal, to monastics, laypeople, Buddhists and non-Buddhists.

The next major influence on Chinese Pure Land was Daochuo, who wrote a work defending Pure land from its critics. Daochuo promoted the view that the world was entering the &quot;last days of the Dharma&quot; (&quot;mòfǎ&quot; 末法). In this era, the &quot;path of the sages&quot; (&quot;shèngdào&quot;) which relies on classic Buddhist self-development and on &quot;self-power&quot; (&quot;zìlì&quot; 自力), was not feasible or effective. Instead the most effect method now was &quot;to repent our sins, to cultivate virtues, and to utter the Buddha&#x27;s name&quot; and thus to leave this defiled world for the Pure Land. Daochuo called this &quot;the way of rebirth in the Pure Land&quot; (&quot;wǎngshēng jìngtǔ&quot; 往生淨土) and associated it with the &quot;other power&quot; (&quot;tālì&quot; 他力) of Amitabha. In responding to critics of Pure Land Buddhism, Daochuo said that the Pure Land was a conventional truth, a skillful means taught by the Buddhas for the benefit of sentient beings. Daochuo also held that those who had heard the Pure Land teachings had already cultivated good roots of merit in past lives as well as bodhicitta, thus they already had the necessary merit to attain the Pure Land. Thus, in his view, reaching the Pure Land required a certain amount of merit.

===Shandao and Huaigan===

Shandao (7th century) was a student of Daochuo who lived in the ancient capital of Chang’an and focused on spreading the Pure Land teachings among ordinary people (instead of at court). He is said to have had many followers and to have distributed numerous sutras and paintings of the Pure land (which he painted himself). According to Jones, Shandao is the true founder of the Pure Land tradition. This is because, according to Jones, &quot;while Tanluan and Daochuo provided some of the necessary conceptual pieces and served as exemplars, it was Shandao who stated clearly and fully that ordinary beings can attain rebirth in the Pure Land through the power of Amitābha&#x27;s vow.&quot;

Shandao wrote a large four volume commentary to the &quot;Amitayurdhyana Sutra&quot;, which he held was taught for the benefit of the common folk (which he sees as exemplified by the character of queen Videhi and in himself). To attain the Pure Land, one must have a deep, sincere trust in Amitabha and deeply desire to be reborn in the Pure Land and then perform the five forms of religious practice. Reciting the name of Amitabha is the main practice, which is supported by the auxiliary practices of chanting the Pure Land sutras, visualization and meditation on Amitabha, worshiping and bowing to Amitabha and praising and making offerings to Amitabha. These practices led to birth in the Pure land, as well as to meditative absorption (samadhi) and visions of Amitabha in this life. While Shandao taught these auxiliary practices, he also held that reciting Amitabha&#x27;s name ten times was sufficient for rebirth in the pure land.

Jones notes that it was Shandao who promoted the centrality of the oral recitation of Amitabha&#x27;s name as the main Pure Land practice (which he connected with the term &quot;nian&quot;), previous patriarchs had not focused on this aspect and had interpreted &quot;nian&quot; differently. Jones notes that the term niàn 念 can mean both contemplate and recite. Another important doctrinal development of Shandao was the idea that the power of Amitabha&#x27;s vows not only established the Pure Land, but also caused even the most depraved beings to be reborn there. Previous patriarchs like Tanluan had only held that Amitabha&#x27;s power merely created the Pure Land, where beings would be reborn according to their own merit and bodhicitta. Shandao meanwhile wrote that it was &quot;entirely due to the power of Amitābha&#x27;s vows&quot; that someone could attain rebirth in Sukhavati, which also appeared equally as a sambhoghakaya (reward body) to all beings, no matter how depraved they were.

Shandao&#x27;s disciple, Huaigan (d. 699) was also an important figure in his own right. According to Jones, Huaigan&#x27;s apologetic &quot;Treatise explaining a number of doubts about Pure Land&quot;, (&quot;Shì jìngtǔ qúnyí lùn&quot; 釋淨土群疑論, T.1960) &quot;added a great deal of philosophical depth to Shandao&#x27;s basic framework.&quot; The work explains how the power of the Buddha can override individual&#x27;s negative karma and allow them to see the purity of the Pure Land and be reborn there among the lower grades of beings. He does not reject the more elite and high level practices and attainments (and the idea that they lead to higher ranks in the Pure Land) but he also argues for the idea that even the most defiled people will also enter the Pure Land as part of those of the lowest grade (of rebirth forms), as explained in the &quot;Amitayus Contemplation Sutra&quot;.

Another influential text written during the time of Huaigan was the &quot;Discourse on ten doubts about Pure Land&quot; (&quot;Jìngtǔ shí yí lùn&quot; 淨土十疑論, T.1961). This text was attributed to Zhiyi, but cannot be by him according to Jones and it betrays the influence of Huaigan&#x27;s ideas as well as those of Tanluan and Daochuo.

=== Principles ===
In China, Pure Land practices were always historically viewed as a practice or method that could be integrated together with the teachings and practices of other Buddhist traditions. As such, many modern scholars argue that no independent Pure Land &quot;school&quot; or &quot;clan&quot; (zōng 宗) existed in China, and it was regarded and practiced as an integral part of other &quot;schools&quot; such as Tiantai, Vinaya and Chan.

According to Charles B. Jones, the Pure Land was most often described in pre-modern Chinese sources as a &quot;dharma-gate&quot; (fǎmén 法門), meaning a path or way of practice. When the term zōng was used, it did not refer to an institution, but to the &quot;cardinal tenet&quot; of Pure Land teaching. Some Chinese Buddhists might have used Pure Land practice as their main or only practice, while for others it could be a subsidiary method.

Pure Land cosmology, soteriology, and ritual were always part-and-parcel of Chinese Buddhism in general and Chan monasticism in particular. The modern conception of an independent and self-conscious Chinese Pure Land historical &quot;school&quot; with its own patriarchate and teachings, and the associated notion of Chan/Pure Land syncretism, have been influenced by the work of Japanese Buddhist studies scholars and the enduring legacy of Japanese sectarian disputes over Chinese Patriarchs. In reality, Pure Land and Chan/Zen practice were historically and still often seen as being mutually compatible, and no strong distinctions are made. Chinese Buddhists have traditionally viewed the practice of meditation and the practice of reciting Amitābha Buddha&#x27;s name, as complementary and even analogous methods for achieving enlightenment. This is because they view recitation as a meditation method used to concentrate the mind and purify thoughts. Chinese Buddhists widely consider this form of recitation as a very effective form of meditation practice.

Historically, Buddhist teachers in China have taken eclectic approaches in their practice by teaching various Buddhist schools of thought concurrently (including Pure Land and Chan), without emphasizing any strict sectarian delineation between them. For example, prominent monastics such as Tanluan were recorded as having written commentaries on non-Pure Land related scriptures, and there is little evidence of them having advocated for Pure Land as an independent &quot;school&quot; of Buddhism. Another example is Hanshan Deqing and many of his contemporaries who advocated the dual practice of the Chan and Pure Land methods, advocating mindfulness of Amitābha to purify the mind for the attainment of self-realization.

===Responses to Chan critics===
There were many other important Chinese Pure Land masters besides these three widely known patriarchs (Tanluan, Daochuo, and Shandao). Later figures were forced to defend Pure Land Buddhism against the critiques of the growing Chan Buddhist tradition and reposition Pure Land in the new Buddhist landscape.

One important figure in this regard was the monk Cimin Huiri (c. 680–74), who is known to have visited India. Cimin defended Pure Land Buddhism from the critiques of Chan masters that argued that all we needed to do was practice meditation. Cimin&#x27;s main defense of Pure Land is found in his &quot;Collection Outlining Various Scriptures and Treatises Regarding Methods of Contemplating the Buddha and Rebirth in the Pure Land&quot;. For Cimin, Chan masters who criticized Pure Land were arrogant unawakened people who falsely claimed enlightenment and denied basic Buddhist teaching and scriptures in favor of their own narrow focus on meditative concentration. In contrast, Cimin recommended &quot;nien-fo, scripture chanting, and invocation of the bodhisattvas, in addition to vegetarianism,&quot; as a basic structure of Pure Land practice.

Another key figure in the Pure Land - Chan debate was Fei-hsi (8th century). His works, such as &quot;Nien-fo san-mei pao-wang fun&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Contemplation of the Buddha as the Jewel King of Meditation&quot;), are more accommodating to the Chan perspective than Cimin&#x27;s. He cites the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;&#x27;s chapter on Never Disparaging bodhisattva (whose attitude is that we should see all beings as future Buddhas and never disparage any of them) as a conciliatory text which leads to his more friendly attitute to Chan. Fei-hsi also attempts to argue for the unity of the practice of the Pure Land nianfo method and the Chan doctrine of no-mind by using the classic Huayan doctrine of principle and phenomena. Fei-hsi&#x27;s method involved &quot;using the mind of nien-fo to enter into the patience based on the insight of non-arising.&quot; This method is also based on the power of the Buddha, whose activity allows the Pure Land practitioner to enter the realm of ultimate principle.

=== Later developments ===

A later figure was Fazhao (died c. 820), who was influential in increasing the popularity of Pure land with the Imperial court. Fazhao is known for standardizing the Chinese classic chant of &quot;na-mo a-mi-tuo fo&quot; (&quot;adoration [or prostration] to Amitabha Buddha&#x27;), which came to be known as the &quot;nianfo&quot;.

Unlike in the Japanese Pure Land of Shinran and Honen, Chinese Buddhist Pure Land practice was never really exclusivist and was often practiced in tandem with other Buddhist methods. Yongming Yanshou (904–975) is one of the many figures which taught the unity of Chan Buddhism with Pure Land practice. For Yanshou, the Pure Land and Chan are really both working for the same thing, the pure mind, since the Pure land is just the pure mind (as the &quot;Vimalakirti sutra&quot; states). Furthermore, for Yanshou, both methods are just ways of cutting self grasping, since the Pure Land abandonment of self-power is none other than the Buddhist teaching of not-self.

During the Tang and Song dynasties, Tiantai school monks were pivotal in the spreading of Pure Land practice in China. Some of the key Pure Land figures of the Tang were affiliated with Tiantai, including Chengyuan (712-802) and Fazhao (fl. 766). Tiantai school authors also wrote various Pure Land texts and commentaries during the Tang as Pure Land Buddhism grew in popularity. At least five different Pure Land works were written in the Tang and apocryphally attributed to Zhiyi, including the &quot;Guan-jing-shu&quot; (a commentary to the Contemplation Sutra) and the &quot;Jingtu shiyilun&quot;.

During the Song dynasty (960–1279), Tiantai monks such as Shengchang (Shěngcháng 省常, 959–1020), Ciyun Zunshi (Cíyún Zūnshì 慈雲尊式, 964–1032), and Siming Zhili, were key figures who founded Pure Land societies which focused on nianfo. Many of these Tiantai figures also wrote Pure Land treatises and commentaries. Another Tiantai Pure Land author is Zongxiao (1151–1214), author of the &quot;Lebang Wenlei,&quot; a Pure Land anthology. 

Another important figure of the Song was Yuanzhao (1048–1116). A Vinaya master from the Nanshan lineage of the Vinaya school, Yuanzhao later converted to Pure Land Buddhism after an illness and staunchly defended the Pure Land path. He also wrote commentaries on the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Amitabha Sutra&quot;, drawing on the works of previous authors like Ciyun Zunshi and Shandao. Also during the Song, many Pure Land societies modeled on those of the Tiantai masters were founded, and these societies continued to be popular in later dynasties. Some of these met in temples and others had specially constructed &quot;Pure Land halls or White Lotus halls. Mao Ziyuan and Yuanzhao are some important later figures who were associated with Pure land societies. 

Yet another later Pure Land author was the Yuan dynasty monk Tianru Weize (天如惟則, c. 1286?–1354), who wrote the &quot;Questions about Pure Land&quot; (&quot;Jìngtǔ huòwèn&quot; 淨土或問, T.1972) as a dialogue between a skeptical Chan monk who poses questions about Pure Land practice, saying that it is dualistic. Tianru defends the idea that an evil person can attain the Pure Land at death by arguing that at death, a person&#x27;s power of concentration becomes very strong and that during this special time, they may repent of their past deeds with complete sincerity. 

A more comprehensive blend of Chan, Pure Land and doctrinal learning (which was associated with schools like Tiantai and Huayan) became popular during the Ming and Qing dynasties, especially through the work of Yúnqī Zhūhóng (雲棲祩宏, 1535–1615). He was one of the most influential figures of the Ming, along with Yuan Hongdao (Yuán Hóngdào 袁宏道, 1568–1610). Ouyi Zhixu (Ǒuyì Zhìxù 藕益智旭, 1599–1655), was another important Pure Land figure of the Ming. Ouyi wrote on a wide variety of topics that included both Pure Land and precepts.

During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), various authors also synthesized Huayan thought with Pure Land practice. The most influential promoters of Huayan-Nianfo were the monk Baiting Xufa (1641–1728) and the lay literatus Peng Shaosheng (彭紹升‎, 1740–1796). These figures generally promoted the practice of nianfo backed by the teachings of the &quot;Avatamsaka sutra&quot; and Huayan metaphysics. For Peng Shaosheng, Amitabha and Vairocana (the Buddha of the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot;) were identical, and Sukhavati was likewise identical to Vairocana&#x27;s Lotus Treasury World.

=== Modern views ===

In modern China, Pure Land practice remains an influential Dharma gate among Chinese Buddhists. Several modern Chinese figures have also promoted Pure Land as a main practice, and even as an independent tradition. Master Yìnguāng (1861–1941) was particularly influential in the modern revival of Pure Land in mainland China. He was so influential in his own time that he became known as “the pillar and guide of contemporary Pure Land,” and “the builder of Pure Land school”. As such, he was soon recognized as the &quot;thirteen patriarch&quot; of Chinese Pure Land by his contemporaries and followers.

Another key figure in the Pure Land revival was Yáng Wénhùi (1837–1911), who published the Pure Land writings of Shandao in his Jinling Sutra Publishing House after recovering them from Japan (these writings had long been lost in the Chinese mainland). He was also well known for promoting and defending the Chinese Pure Land Buddhist tradition.

Other important figures include Venerable Jìngkōng (1927–2022), and Venerable Guang Qin (1892–1986). Another modern Chinese Pure Land teacher is Master Da’an, abbot of Donglin Temple (Jiujiang) at the famous Mount Lu.

One unique Chinese Pure Land organization that has arisen is the Pristine Pure Land School of Dharma Master Huijing (1950–) and Dharma Master Jingzong (1966–, Abbot of Hongyuan Monastery). This tradition focuses exclusively on Pure land study and practice, informed by the works of Shandao.

Another Chinese Pure Land organization that has developed recently is the Hwadzan Pure Land Association based in Taipei. They are known for their online presence and for using the internet as a way to spread the Pure Land teachings.

== Patriarchs ==
As the Chinese Pure land school (jìngtǔ zōng 淨土宗) developed its own self conscious identity as a &quot;school&quot; (Ch: zōng), lists of Chinese pure land &quot;patriarchs&quot; (zǔ 祖) developed which included later key figures in Chinese Pure Land.

The first widely recognized list of Pure Land patriarchs appears in the Southern Song (1127–1279) in the writings of the Tiantai monk Shizhi Zongxiao (1151–1214) who lists six patriarchs: Huiyuan, Shandao, Fazhao, Shaokang, Xingchang, and Changlu Zongze (長蘆宗賾, dates unknown).

The modern Chinese Pure Land Buddhist tradition following Yinguang&#x27;s &quot;Lianzong shi’er zu zansong&quot; (蓮宗十二祖讚頌) recognizes thirteen patriarchs:

# Huiyuan of Mt. Lu (盧山慧遠, 334-416)
# Guangming Shandao (光明善導, 613-681)
# Banzhou Chengyuan (般舟承遠, 713-802)
# Zhulin Fazhao (竹林法照, ca. 740–838)
# Wulong Shaokang (烏龍少康, 736–806)
# Yongming Yanshou (永明延壽, 904–975)
# Zhaoqing Xingchang (昭慶省常, 959–1020)
# Yunqi Zhuhong (1535–1615), also known as Lianchi 蓮池
# Ouyi Zhixu (1599–1655)
# Puren Xingce (普仁行策, 1626–1682)
# Fantian Xing’an 梵天省庵, 1686–1734
# Jixing Chewu (1741–1810)
# Lingyan Yinguang (1861–1941)
The Japanese Jōdo-shū school recognizes five patriarchs before Hōnen (which are listed in Hōnen&#x27;s &quot;Jōdo goso den&quot;): 

# Tanluan (476–542)
# Daochuo (562–645)
# Shandao (613–681)
# Huaigan (懷感, 7th century)
# Wulong Shaokang (736–806)

Meanwhile, Japanese Pure Land Buddhist school of Jodo Shinshu relies on a slightly different list of seven patriarchs (shichiso):

# Nagarjuna (3rd century)
# Vasubandhu (4–5th century)
# Tanluan (476–542)
# Daochuo (562–645)
# Shandao (613–681)
# Genshin (源信, 942–1017)
# Hōnen (法然, 1133–1212)

Furthermore, for Jodo Shinshu, Shinran is considered to be the final and culminating patriarch of the Pure Land tradition.

== Korea ==
Pure Land thought also made its way into Korean Buddhism from China during the Unified Silla period (668–935). Perhaps the most influential figure in this development was Wŏnhyo (617–686), who widely promoted nianfo practice and wrote ten texts on Pure Land Buddhism, including commentaries on the Pure Land sūtras. Korean practitioners of Pure Land like Wŏnhyo never set out to establish a separate school of Buddhism, instead they saw Pure land practice as part of the larger Mahayana tradition.

In his commentary on the Larger Sutra, Wŏnhyo emphasized that birth in the Pure Land could be attained by relying on the other-power of the compassion (chabiryŏk 慈悲力) of the buddha, rather than by relying on one&#x27;s own self-power. Thus, like Shandao, Wŏnhyo argued that all living beings, not just bodhisattvas on the bhumis, could attain birth in the Pure Land by relying on the Buddha&#x27;s power.

In Wŏnhyo&#x27;s Pure Land writings, he argues that the superior practice of nianfo is the one which is done with bodhicitta and with a repentant, sincere mind (chisim 至心). Indeed, in his &quot;Muryangsu-gyŏng chongyo&quot; (無量壽經宗要&quot;, Doctrinal Essentials of the Sūtra on the Visualization of Immeasurable Life&quot;), Wŏnhyo argues that it is bodhicitta which is the primary cause of birth in the Pure land.

Wŏnhyo&#x27;s Pure Land thought is based on numerous Mahayana sources, including the works of Zhiyi, Tanluan along with Chinese Yogācāra and Tathāgatagarbha thought. Later Silla era Pure Land authors like Pŏbwi, Hyŏnil, Uijŏk, and Kyŏnghung all follow Wŏnhyo&#x27;s synthetic method of interpreting Pure Land by drawing on the broader Mahayana doctrinal tradition. There may have been also been lineage of Pure land praxis based in Hwangnyong Monastery (皇龍寺) which could be traced back to Wŏn’gwang 圓光 (c. 540–640), who may have studied under Huiyuan. However, his works are all lost. Chajang may have been another important figure for Korean Pure Land, but his works (including two commentaries on the &quot;Amitabha sutra&quot;) are also lost. As such, it is in the works of Wŏnhyo that early Korean Pure land ideas can be found and it is his work which influenced all later Korean writings on Pure Land.

Another important figure in Korean Pure Land thought was the Hwaeom founder Uisang (625–702) who wrote a commentary on the Amitabha sutra, the &quot;Amit’a-gyŏng ŭigi&quot; (阿彌陀經義記 &quot;The meaning of the Amituo jing&quot;). Pure land practice was also an important part of the Cheontae school (Korean Tiantai).

==Japan==
Pure Land practice arrived in Japan from China and Korea in around the 7th century. During the Nara period (710–794), several monks taught nianfo (Japanese: nenbutsu) and wrote on Pure Land practice. These included Chikō (709–770 or 781) of the Sanron (Middle Way) school and Zenju (723–797) of the Hossō (Yogacara) school. Chikō&#x27;s writings teach oral and visualized nenbutsu, with the main goal of attaining samadhi, but also rebirth in the Pure Land.

The most important schools of Japanese Buddhism developed between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. They were mostly influenced by the eclectic teachings of the Tendai school as their founding monks were all trained originally in the school. This school was founded by Saichō (767–822), who studied the Chinese Tiantai school in China, including the nianfo methods taught by Zhiyi.

During the Heian period, Japanese Pure Land continued to develop in Tendai monasteries, such as the Mt. Hiei complex. One early Tendai figure, Ennin, is known for having brought back the practice of nembutsu from China, and this became the foundation for later Pure Land movements in Japan. It was Tendai monks like Zenyu (913–990) and Senkan (918–983) who first developed a distinctively Japanese Pure Land Buddhist discourse and who authored the &quot;Amida shinjūgi&quot; and &quot;Jūgan hosshinki&quot;, respectively.

Another important early figure of Japanese Pure Land was Genshin (942–1017), a Tendai monk known for his promotion of Pure Land practice and his writing of the &quot;Ōjōyōshū&quot; (&quot;Essentials of Birth in the Pure Land&quot;) which teaches Amitabha visualization and nembutsu and which was very influential for later Japanese Pure Land authors. Genshin held that since we had entered the era of Dharma decline (&quot;mappo&quot;), the easy practice of nenbutsu was most effective now. However, he did not argue, like later Japanese Pure Land Buddhists, that one should only practice nenbutsu exclusively and instead believed that the nenbutsu practice was to be supplemented by other practices.

Pure Land practice also continued to develop in other Japanese schools of Buddhism. Figures such as Eikan (1033–1111) and Chinkai (c. 1091–1152) of the Sanron school and Kakuban (1095–1143) of the Shingon school all promoted their own form of Pure Land nembutsu based practice.

Apart from these official monastic figures, there also existed itinerant holy men who traveled the countryside preaching about Pure Land practice. These preachers who practiced outside the authority of official temples, were called &quot;hijiri&quot;. Some were properly ordained, but others were self-ordained or not ordained at all. Perhaps the most well known of these was Kūya (903–972), who was known for taking images of Amitabha with him and for his musical chanting of the nembutsu. He mainly wandered the country ministering to commoners and teaching them to chant the nenbutsu as well as providing other services like burying the dead, making wells and bridges and helping the needy. He was also devoted to Kannon.

Pure Land practice also spread among commoners and laypersons, especially due to the rise in popularity of deathbed rituals and popular collections of stories of people who had achieved rebirth in the Pure Land, such as the &quot;Nihon Ōjō Gokuraku-ki&quot; (&quot;Records of Rebirth in Utmost Bliss in Japan&quot;) by Jakushin (c. 985).

===Independent sects===
Japanese Pure Land teachings eventually led to the formation of independent Pure Land institutions, as can be seen in the Jōdo-shū, , Yūzū-nembutsu-shū, and Ji-shū. These new Pure Land schools were part of a new wave of Buddhist schools founded in the Kamakura period (1185–1333), each which tended to narrow its focus around a single simple practice which was promoted exclusively above all others, especially the complex rituals and practices of Tendai Buddhism. This new focus allowed these schools to appeal to a wider base of support among the commoners.

The first of these, the small Yūzū-nembutsu sect, was founded by the Tendai monk Ryōnin (1072–1132), who taught that just chanting nenbutsu as one&#x27;s main practice was all that one needed to do to complete all virtues. He was influenced by the Huayan idea of interpenetration and held that chanting the nenbutsu not affected oneself, but also affected everyone around us. In his community, practitioners would sign a register and pledge to recite a certain number of nenbutsus per day. They would also hold joint recitation sessions and believed that all members received the collective benefit of their recitations.

====Hōnen&#x27;s Jōdo-shū====
Hōnen (1133–1212) was a Tendai monk influenced by Genshin who initially practiced under a successor of Ryōnin at Mount Hiei. Through his efforts, a new independent Buddhist school was established (Jōdo-shū) which focused exclusively on Pure Land practice of the nenbutsu (nianfo). Influenced by the work Shandao, Hōnen held that to reach the Pure Land it was only necessary to orally recite the name of Amitabha. One did not need to meditate, perform any rituals, visualize any Buddha, study sutras or do any other practice (as was common in Tendai and Chinese Pure Land). One just had to recite the name with faith and joy. Thus, Hōnen&#x27;s doctrine favored simple nenbutsu recitation above all other practices. Indeed, he argued that all other practices were inferior to nenbutsu in this degenerate age.

However, Hōnen is known to have scrupulously kept the Tendai precepts, and to have continued to perform rituals and study texts. Thus, he did not teach that one should completely discard all other practices, only that the nenbutsu was supreme and that only nenbutsu could lead to Buddhahood. And yet, he held that other practices (those which Shandao taught as auxiliary to nenbutsu) could enrich one&#x27;s nenbutsu practice.

According to Hōnen, even the most unethical or lowly people (like fishermen, prostitutes, etc.) would be saved, as they were, by simply reciting &quot;namu amida butsu&quot;. Likewise, one did not have to worry about paying for deathbed rituals or organizing one&#x27;s last days in any specific way. Simply by reciting nenbutsu now one would be saved whenever death came. This simple teaching became very popular in Japan, especially among ordinary people. Because of his reliance on a single simple practice, Hōnen&#x27;s teaching was widely criticized as neglecting basic Buddhist ethics and bodhicitta. A notable critique was penned by the Kegon author Myōe. While Hōnen was discreet in his critiques of other forms of Buddhism, some of his disciples were not. A scandal involving rumors of some of Hōnen&#x27;s disciples and an imperial concubine led to Hōnen&#x27;s exile and the persecution of some of his disciples.

After Hōnen&#x27;s death, many of his writings were destroyed by the Tendai school warrior monks who also destroyed his tomb. The state also attempted to suppress his teachings, sending many of his disciples far away from the capital and this may have contributed to spread of the tradition all over Japan. There was also a dispute among his followers over the issue of two different doctrinal stances: once-calling (Jp: &quot;ichinengi&quot;) and many-calling (&quot;tanengi&quot;). Once-calling held that you only needed to recite nenbutsu once and you would be saved, the many-calling view held that you needed to recite nenbutsu as much as possible. According to Jones, Hōnen had generally held that many-calling view, arguing for sustained practice, but the once-calling view also had some scriptural support. Thus, the debate continued long after his death.

Initially, the Jōdo-shū were a faction (&quot;ha&quot;) or sub-sect of the Tendai school, but after the 14th century, it developed into an independent tradition, which was more like a loose family of lineages. A particularly influential event was the founding of the Chinzei branch by Benchō (1162–1238) and the subsequent work of Shōgei (1341–1420) to set up a formal training program for Jōdo Shū priests. This meant they no longer needed to study the monasteries of other traditions. The other main lineage of Jōdo-shū is the Seizan (West Mountain) branch founded by Shōkū (1177–1247).

====Shinran&#x27;s Jōdo Shinshū====
After Hōnen&#x27;s death, one of his disciples, Shinran Shōnin (1173–1262) created another new Pure Land school, the (True Pure Land, also known as Shin Buddhism) which would eventually grow to become one of the largest Buddhist schools in Japan. Shinran had been a Tendai monk who saw himself as unsuited to the rigorous practices of the Tendai sect and became a follower of Hōnen.

After he was exiled and defrocked with his master, Shinran married and remained a layman even after he was pardoned by the state in 1211. He then moved to the Kantō region with his family. It was at this time that he realized his practice of all other Buddhist methods other than the nenbutsu were futile and he entrusted himself completely to the power of Amitabha. Shinran would go on to write some important works on Pure Land thought and practice, mainly the &quot;Kyōgyōshinshō&quot; and the &quot;Tannishō,&quot; which discuss the importance of total self-abandonment or entrusting (Jp. &quot;shinjin&quot;) of ourselves to the Buddha Amitabha.

For Shinran, this shinjinfaith or entrustingbecame the center of his teaching, which according to Jones, was &quot;a deep conversion experience and the very means by which rebirth became assured.&quot; For Shinran, any religious effort arose from a lack of trust in Amitabha&#x27;s power and vows, which was the only thing that actually led to Buddhahood. Thus, one had to realize that one&#x27;s own efforts were futile and completely entrust oneself to Amitabha. This total faith expresses itself as the nenbutsu. If someone has not developed shinjin, nenbutsu at least acts as a reminder that one requires salvation from Amitabha, and if one has developed shinjin, it is an expression of gratitude. This entrusting is a total letting go which comes from Amitabha&#x27;s grace, our own true nature, the Buddha-nature. This is the real &quot;other power&quot; (Jp. tariki) of Amitabha that is beyond the egoistic &quot;self-power&quot; (jiriki) and all notions of self and effort. Thus, other power is not something outside of us according to Shinran, but is immanent as our Buddha-nature.

The fact that Shinran was not a monk meant that he and his followers often did not meet in temples, but in various other places, including private homes, which they might designate as dōjōs. These lay groups or congregations (monto) would also choose their own leaders and meet to practice nenbutsu together. According to Jones, &quot;The development of independent congregations of laypeople managing their own practice and organizations loosened the control that religious orders and the aristocracy traditionally exercised, and it represented a new, more democratic structure for Japanese Buddhism as a whole.&quot;

After his death, Shinran&#x27;s communities remained as independent congregations, and the tradition now known as &quot;Jōdo Shinshū&quot; slowly developed over time. Shinran&#x27;s sons and family, especially his grandson Kakunyo (1270–1351) and great-grandson Zonkaku (1290–1373) became influential caretakers of the tradition centered on Honganji temple which was built on the site of Shinran&#x27;s grave. Preaching and proselytizing was an important part of the tradition and there was a kind of equality between men and women (who were also given leadership roles). Rennyo (1415–1499) was one of the most influential figures in Shin Buddhist history. He was the eighth head of Honganji and led an expansion in membership and unification of Shin Buddhism. He also wrote new texts which clarified the doctrine of the tradition.

====Ippen====
Another, smaller Pure Land sect known as Jishū (時宗) was founded by Ippen (1239–1289). Ippen was influenced by Hōnen, as well as Zen and Shingon Buddhism. He wandered throughout Japan teaching nenbutsu with a band of followers. Ippen taught that not even faith was necessary for salvation, only the actual chanting the nenbutsu alone was needed. This is because he held, like Tanluan, that the mere name of Amitabha contained his entire reality. Amitabha was fully present in the name, since his existence, his Dharmakaya, was all pervasive. Thus, the recitation of the nenbutsu made one&#x27;s mind non-dual with Amitabha. Because of this, one did not need to generate faith. Faith was a gift from the Buddha, but not something we could give rise to by ourselves (since this was a kind of self-power) and so we should not be concerned with it. Ippen&#x27;s teaching was very popular and his sect was the dominant Pure Land sect for the two centuries following his death, but then it went into decline.

===Later developments===
Today in Japan, Pure Land schools make up almost 40 percent of Buddhist practitioners and has the most temples, second only to Zen schools. In Japan, strong institutional boundaries exist between sects which serve to clearly separate the Japanese Pure Land schools from the Japanese Zen schools. One notable exception to this is found in the Ōbaku Zen school, which was founded in Japan during the 17th century by the Chinese Buddhist monk Ingen (Chinese &quot;Yinyuan Longqi&quot;). The Ōbaku school of Zen retains many Chinese features such as mindfulness of Amitābha through recitation and recitation of the Pure Land sūtras.

Upon encountering Japanese Pure Land traditions which emphasize faith, many westerners saw outward parallels between these traditions and Protestant Christianity. This has led many western authors to speculate about possible connections between these traditions. However, the cosmology, internal assumptions, and underlying doctrines and practices are now known to have many differences.

==East Asian doctrines==

Contemporary Pure Land traditions see Amitābha expounding the Dharma in his Pure Land (Chinese: &quot;jìngtǔ&quot; 淨土), a region offering respite from karmic transmigration. Amitābha&#x27;s pure land of Sukhāvatī (Land of Bliss) is described in the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot; as a land of beauty that surpasses all other realms. It is said to be inhabited by many gods, men, flowers, fruits, and adorned with wish-granting trees where rare birds come to rest. Chinese Pure Land sources describe it by various names including &quot;Western buddha-land&quot; (&quot;xīfāng fótǔ&quot; 西方佛土), &quot;Land of Amitābha Buddha&quot; (&quot;āmítuófó guó&quot; 阿彌陀佛國), Utmost Bliss&quot; (&quot;jílè&quot; 極樂), Peace and Nurturance&quot; (ānyǎng 安養) and Peace and Bliss&quot; (ānlè 安樂).

In Pure Land traditions, entering the Pure Land is popularly perceived as equivalent to the attainment the bodhisattva stage of non-retrogression. Upon entry into the Pure Land, the practitioner is then instructed in the Dharma by Amitābha Buddha and numerous bodhisattvas until they attain full buddhahood. Bodhisattvas also have the capacity of sending out manifestation bodies to any of the six realms of existence in order to help all sentient beings in saṃsāra, all without actually leaving the Pure Land.

In Mahāyāna Buddhism, there are many buddhas, and each buddha has a pure land. Amitābha&#x27;s pure land of Sukhāvatī is understood to be in the western direction, whereas Akṣobhya&#x27;s pure land of Abhirati is to the east. Though there are other Buddhist traditions devoted to being reborn in the company of other Buddhas (such as Maitreya), Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land is by far the most popular. Indeed, according to Jones, most Chinese, Japanese and Korean Buddhists today practice to reach the Pure Land of Amitabha in some way.

Pure Land Buddhists believe that there is evidence of dying people going to the pure land, including knowing the time of death, visions of Amitābha and the two bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta and records of past Pure Land Buddhists who have died and left behind relics (&quot;śarīra)&quot;.

===Other direction vs Mind-only===

The Pure Land is widely understood by many classic Chinese Pure Land sources as surpassing or being beyond the triple realm (the desire realm, form realm and formless realm). However, while it was and is common to think of the Pure Land as an actual place that one is literally reborn into after death, other sources and authors emphasize the idea that this world is itself coextensive with the Pure Land and thus that they are not separate places. According to Jones, &quot;the most frequently cited texts in support of this version of the Pure Land were the &quot;Vimalakīrti Sutra&quot; (&quot;Wéimójí suǒshuō jīng&quot; 維摩詰所說經, T.475) and the &quot;Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch&quot; (&quot;Liù zǔ dàshī fǎbǎo tán jīng&quot; 六祖大師法寶壇經, T.2008).&quot;

Thus, Chinese Buddhism inherited two different views of the Pure Land:

* &quot;western-direction Pure Land&quot; (xīfāng jìngtǔ 西方淨 土) or &quot;other-direction Pure Land&quot; (tāfāng jìngtǔ 他方淨土) which saw the Pure Land as another realm that was far away from this world and which one could attain after death by being reborn there after performing various Pure Land practices. This view was defended by figures like Tanluan and Shandao and tended to be popular among the more devotional oriented figures which taught about the Pure Land and these figures tended to focus on the magnificent features of the Pure Land in order to arouse a desire to go to there in their disciples.
* &quot;mind-only Pure Land&quot; (wéixīn jìngtǔ 唯心淨土), which was also favored by the Chan (Zen) tradition, held that this world is itself a Pure Land and it only appears impure because of our own impure minds project impurity on the world. In this view, by purifying our minds we gain the Pure Land. A passage from the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot; which states &quot;this mind creates the Buddha, this mind is the Buddha&quot; is also used by the defenders of this view.

According to Jones, these two ideas led to many debates within Chinese Buddhism, which continued right up to the 20th century. The Pure Land patriarch Yìnguāng (c. 1861–1940) for example, writes that to see the various splendors of the Pure Land as &quot;fables, metaphors, or psychological states&quot; was &quot;heretical&quot; and a &quot;ludicrous view&quot;.

On the other hand, those who promoted the &quot;mind-only Pure Land&quot; view saw the idea that the Pure Land was &quot;somewhere else&quot; as violating the Mahayana doctrine of the non-duality of purity and impurity, of samsara and nirvana. They also held that stating that a Pure Land can exist external to the mind and can appear pure even to an impure mind contradicts the Mahayana idea that the world is constructed by the mind. This view is defended by the famous Chan text known as the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot;. In this text, Huineng states that only the deluded hope to be born in a faraway land in the west, while the wise who know their nature is empty seek the Pure Land by purifying their minds.

Other Chinese thinkers attempted to reconcile the two views. Yúnqī Zhūhóng (1535–1615) held that the teachings on the existence of the Pure Land as a place was a skillful means (upāya) which the Buddha used to help those of lesser capacities. In reality, the Buddha has no need of an actual place or land since he dwells everywhere, and yet out of compassion for others who need such a place, he manifests the Pure Land in order to draw in sentient beings. Once they reach the Pure Land, they learn the Dharma and realize it was always just mind. True sages know both that both truths are deeply interpenetrating and thus they can hold both ideas (other direction and mind-only Pure Land) without contradiction. Thus, he writes:Now to contemplate (niàn 念) emptiness is true nian, and production enters into non-production [or, birth enters into non-birth], and to nian the Buddha (nianfo) is to nian the mind. Birth there (i.e., in the Pure Land) does not mean leaving birth here (the present defiled world). Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings are of one substance, the middle stream does not abide on [either of] the two banks. Therefore, we say &quot;the Amitābha of one&#x27;s own nature; the Pure Land of mind-only.&quot;

===Apologetics===
Chinese thinkers like Zuhong and Yuan Hongdao also developed a schema which included various categories of Pure Lands. With these schema, they could accept the existence of both &quot;mind-only&quot; Pure Lands as well as Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land as another world. Yuan&#x27;s schema also includes numerous other types of Pure Lands found in Mahayana literature, including: the Pure Land of the Primordial Buddha Vairocana which is the entire dharmadhātu in which all dharmas perfectly interfuse, the Pure Land of Vulture Peak assembly taught in the &quot;Lotus Sutra,&quot; which is also called the Constant-truth Pure Land (&quot;héng zhēn jìngtǔ&quot;), and the Conjured-manifestation Pure Land, which only exists for a brief period of time, such as when the Buddha changes the world in the &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot;. Yuan&#x27;s typology of Pure Lands served to resolve some of the conflict regarding the nature of the Pure Land by relying on classic Buddhist sources to show how there was a large variety of Pure Lands to be found in them.

Chinese Pure Land thinkers sometimes defended Pure Land thought by explaining it within the context of Tiantai and Huayan philosophy. For example, Yuan Hongdao used the Tiantai doctrine of the three truths to defend the existence of the Pure Land path as a provisionally true yet empty reality. Meanwhile, Yuan Hongdao and Yinguang both draw on Huayan thought to argue for the truth of Pure Land. Yuan Hongdao uses the Huayan theory of Indra&#x27;s net to explain how the Pure Land perfectly interpenetrates with all buddha-lands and all the impure lands.

Chinese Pure Land thinkers also argued for the efficacy of Pure Land practice in different ways. For example, they argued that the idea that a seemingly small effort of nianfo practice had a great effect was not illogical, since sometimes a small cause (like a spark) could have a great effect (like a large fire caused by one spark). Some also argued that one could not know how much good karma one had accumulated in the past, and that nianfo practice might take many lives to produce birth in the Pure Land.

===Self-power and other-power===
&quot;Self-power&quot; (Ch. zìlì 自力, Jp. jiriki) and &quot;other-power&quot; (Ch. tālì 他力, Jp. tariki) are key terms which are used to explain and define Pure Land practice in East Asian Buddhism. It was Shandao who first argued that Amitabha&#x27;s power helped take people to the Pure Land after death (previous authors just held that Amitabha created the Pure Land and it was up to an individual&#x27;s own effort to make it there). This other power relationship was compared to how a lowly man who is accompanied by a king can enter previously inaccessible places.

Chinese Pure Land Buddhism never denied the importance of self-power. Instead, according to Jones, Chinese Pure Land generally holds that &quot;Rebirth in the Pure Land results when the two powers work together, an idea that the modern Taiwan Pure Land master Zhiyu (Zhìyù 智諭, 1924–2000) captured with the phrase &quot;the two powers of self and other&quot; (&quot;zì-tā èr lì&quot; 自他二力).&quot; Thus, in Chinese Pure Land, rebirth in the Pure Land arises from a cooperation of the practitioner and the Buddha.

Yúnqī Zhūhóng argues that the practitioner&#x27;s efforts connect with the Buddha&#x27;s power through &quot;sympathetic resonance&quot; (&quot;gǎnyìng&quot; 感應) which links them with the Buddha, attuning their mind with that of the Buddha, much like one plucked string in a lute can make another string nearby resonate. According this view, the more that one practiced nianfo, the stronger and more enduring this bond with Amitabha became. However, Chinese Pure Land masters also argued that one certainly cannot rely on self-power alone, which they denigrated as a futile effort.

Chinese authors like Yuan Hongdao also argue that the actual nature of the Pure Land way &quot;is not self-power, nor is it other-power.&quot; Instead, according to Yuan, there is ultimately no real distinction between the Pure Land practitioner and the Buddha Amitābha and thus, the distinction between self-power and other-power is not ultimately real, and yet we can speak of this interaction conventionally (which he describes through metaphors). The twelfth &quot;patriarch&quot;of Chinese Pure Land, Jìxǐng Chèwù (際醒徹悟, 1741–1810) also held that the practitioner and Amitābha, while distinct beings, are also really non-dual. When one chants nianfo, a sympathetic resonance is activated which leads to a non-dual realization of one&#x27;s true nature as Amitabha.

In the Japanese Pure Land schools of Hōnen and Shinran which developed in the Kamakura period, self-power is considered as completely pointless and powerless. Self-power does nothing for the Pure Land devotee. Those who wish to attain the Pure Land must only rely on the other-power of Amitābha, entrusting themselves to it by reciting the nembutsu. Shinran consistently denigrated all efforts to self cultivation and made the entrusting heart (J. &quot;shinjin&quot; 信心) as the only important element in gaining the Pure Land. This created another problem, that of antinomianism, which was the idea that if one&#x27;s salvation is assured, then there was no need to be moral at all and one could engage in wrongdoing without being concerned. Shinran attacked this problem by arguing that engaging in wrongdoing was just another form of clinging to self-power.

Another difference between the Chinese and Japanese traditions is that the Japanese Pure Land schools generally hold that, since the Buddha does all the work of salvation, one&#x27;s rebirth in the Pure Land is assured once one has faithfully recited the Buddha&#x27;s name. No matter how wicked one may still be one will definitely reach the Pure Land. However, the Chinese traditions often hold out the prospect that a Pure Land practitioner might fail to get into the Pure Land due to various factors, such as ethical failings or getting distracted at the crucial moment of death. This is because the Chinese tradition holds that Pure Land practice provides a connection to the Buddha only as long as the practitioner keeps the Buddha in mind. The effects of the practice can cease if one stops doing it. They compared this to lighting a lamp, which can remove all the darkness in a room immediately, but which will not provide light if it is put out.

The concept of other power is related to other important ideas in Pure Land thought and broader Mahayana such as merit transference, esoteric empowerment (adhiṣṭhāna) and the idea that there is an &quot;easy path&quot; and a &quot;difficult path&quot; (or &quot;path of sages&quot;). Transference of merit is the idea that Buddhas and bodhisattvas can transfer their immense stores of merit (&quot;puṇya,&quot; a beneficial protective force that is accumulated by good deeds), to other beings. This idea is found in many Mahayana sutras. The concept of other power is seen as the easy path of practice, following the ideas presented in the &quot;Chapter on Easy Practice&quot; in the &quot;Shí zhù pípóshā lùn&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the ten levels&quot;, T.1521) attributed to Nagarjuna. This text promotes the easy path of Pure land over the difficult path of practice which entails many aeons of practice and may not be suitable for people. This text describes the easy path as follows: &quot;If a bodhisattva wishes to attain to the stage of non-retrogression in this body and accomplish supreme highest enlightenment, he should contemplate (&quot;niàn&quot; 念) all the buddhas of the ten directions and invoke their names.&quot;

===In the human realm===
During the 20th century, a new way of conceiving Pure Land developed which was more humanistic. This development was led by the monk Tàixū 太虛 (1890–1947) who argued that Buddhism should benefit humans in this life, and should not just be for the afterlife. He called this new Buddhism, &quot;Buddhism for Human Life&quot; (&quot;rénshēng fójiào&quot; 人生佛教), which has also been termed Humanistic Buddhism. This new kind of Buddhism promoted the idea that the ideal Buddhist world could be built here and now, something Tàixū called &quot;The Pure Land in the Human Realm&quot; (&quot;rénjiān jìngtǔ&quot; 人間淨土). While Tàixū did not repudiate the idea of post-mortem rebirth in Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land, he also promoted the idea of improving people&#x27;s everyday lives through social reform and the building of an ideal Buddhist community.

Some of Tàixū&#x27;s disciples, like Sheng Yen and Cheng Yen developed his ideas further. According to Jones, they held that Buddhists should not desire to escape from this world of suffering by seeking rebirth in a faraway land. Instead, Buddhists should &quot;engage in social reform and charitable work in order to transform this world into a Pure Land. In this model, the Pure Land will appear when the environment is cleansed and healed, the rights of women and children are safeguarded, and economic and social justice prevail.&quot; However, Jones notes that Sheng Yen&#x27;s writings reveal that he did not reject the practice of seeking rebirth in Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land and instead presented an eclectic view that accepted all views on the Pure Land. According to Sheng Yen, the socially focused actions of humanistic Buddhism do not conflict with traditional Pure Land practices, instead they prepare one for birth in Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land. He also attempts to harmonize these with the other classic view that holds that the Pure land is just in the mind.

==Practices==


Pure Land is one of the most widely practiced traditions of Buddhism in East Asia. It may be the dominant form of Buddhism in China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea.

All Chinese sources agree that the principal practice of the Pure Land &quot;easy path&quot; is &quot;nianfo&quot; (Chinese: 念佛; Japanese: &quot;nenbutsu&quot;), which is described in a variety of different ways by Chinese sources and is also called &quot;holding the name&quot; (&quot;chēngmíng&quot;). Patriarch Shandao writes that while nianfo is the &quot;primary deed&quot; (zhengye) in pure land practice, there are also four other auxiliary practices (zhuye): reciting Pure Land sutras, contemplating Amitabha, worshiping Amitabha and singing praises to Amitabha. All other practices apart from these are &quot;miscellaneous practices&quot; (zaxing) and are secondary to the five primary Pure Land practices. 

In some forms of East Asian Buddhism, nianfo is generally seen as one practice among many. For example, according to Yuan dynasty monk Tiānrú Wéizé&#x27;s (天如惟則, 1286?–1354) &quot;Questions about Pure Land&quot; (T.1972), there are three main approaches to Pure Land practice: visualization (guānxiǎng 觀想), recollection and invocation (yìniàn 意念), and &quot;various practices&quot; (zhòngxíng 眾行) which include ethical precepts, taking refuge and so on (and whose merit can lead to the Pure Land, especially if dedicated to this purpose).

In other quarters however, nianfo is the only practice which is recommended and other practices are not seen as helpful. The Japanese Pure Land sects of Jōdo-shū and traditionally focus on the oral recitation of the nianfo exclusively. Similarly, the Chinese master Jìxǐng Chèwù (1741–1810) practiced and taught nianfo exclusively, having practiced it together with Chan in the past but then having abandoning this dual practice for an exclusive focus on nianfo.

===Nianfo===
====In Chinese Buddhism====
Repeating the name of a Buddha such as Amitābha is traditionally a form of mindfulness of the Buddha (Skt. &quot;&quot;). This term was translated into Chinese as &quot;nianfo&quot;, by which it is popularly known in English. The practice is often described as calling the buddha to mind by repeating his name, to enable the practitioner to bring all his or her attention upon that Buddha (See: &quot;samādhi&quot;) chanting Amituofo while walking, prostrating, or in seated meditation . This may be done vocally or mentally, and with or without the use of Buddhist prayer beads. Those who practice this method often commit to a fixed set of repetitions per day. For instance, the monk Shandao is said to have practiced this day and night without interruption, each time emitting light from his mouth. Therefore, he was bestowed with the title &quot;Great Master of Light&quot; () by Emperor Gaozong of Tang.

However, Chinese Buddhist Pure Land practice also commonly relies on multiple elements for their practice of nianfo, including contemplation and visualization of Amitābha, his attendant bodhisattvas, and the Pure Land. Such visualization methods are found in the &quot;Pratyutpanna-samādhi-sūtra&quot; and in the &quot;Amitayurdhyana Sutra&quot;, which presents sixteen progressive visualizations, each corresponding to the attainment of various levels of rebirth in the Pure Land.

The first of these steps is contemplation of a setting sun, until the visualization is clear whether the eyes are open or closed. Each step adds complexity to the visualization of Sukhāvatī, with the final contemplation being an expansive visual which includes Amitābha and his attendant bodhisattvas. According to Inagaki Hisao, this method was widely followed in the past for the purpose of developing samādhi. Visualization practises for Amitābha are also popular in Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, Shingon Buddhism as well as other schools of Vajrayana.

One Chinese master who taught nianfo along with visualization was Yìnguāng (1861–1940). He also stressed the importance of other elements in this practice, mainly faith in Amitābha, vowing to be reborn in Sukhāvatī and also having the intention to transfer the merit of one&#x27;s practice to all beings. Similarly, Jìxǐng Chèwù stressed the importance of various prerequisite elements to nianfo practice: bodhicitta, faith in the pure land, an aspiration to achieve rebirth there, a sense of shame at past wrongdoing, joy at having learned of Pure Land, sadness over one&#x27;s bad karma and gratitude to the Buddha.

====Types of nianfo====
Guīfēng Zōngmì (圭峰宗密, 780–841) was a Huayan and Chan master who also wrote on nianfo practice. He taught a schema of four types of nianfo which were adopted by later Pure Land authors like Yúnqī Zhūhóng (1535–1615) and Zhìyù (1924–2000). Zōngmì&#x27;s four types of nianfo are (1) Contemplation of the name &quot;which focuses on &quot;mentally holding&quot; the name; (2) Contemplating a image of the Buddha; (3) Contemplating the major and minor marks of a Buddha without a physical image, and (4) &quot; Contemplating the true mark&quot;, in which one contemplates the Dharma Body (Dharmakaya), the true self in all phenomenon.

* &quot;Contemplation of the name&quot; (chēngmíng niàn 稱名念), which is based on &quot;The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra preached by Mañjuśrī&quot; (T.232) and involves selecting a Buddha, facing their direction, and focusing on their name until one has a vision of all Buddhas (past, present, and future). As noted by Jones, while later Chinese Pure Land thinkers interpreted this practice as oral recitation, it seems that for Zongmi this entailed mentally &quot;holding&quot; (chēngmíng 稱名) the sound of the name. Yúnqī Zhūhóng taught &quot;holding the name&quot; in various ways including: audible recitation of the name (míngchí 明持), silent contemplation of the name (mòchí 默持), or contemplation accompanied by barely audible whispering of the name (bànmíng bànmò chí 半 明半默持).
* &quot;Contemplating an image&quot; (guānxiàng niàn 觀像念), which is based on the &quot;Dà bǎojī jīng&quot; (大寶積經 &quot;Great Jewel Collection Sutra&quot;, T.310) Through contemplating an image of a Buddha, one may achieve the realisation the non-duality or separation from imaging with a Buddha and as extension all sentient life.&quot; 
* &quot;Contemplating the visualization&quot; (guānxiǎng niàn 觀想念), &quot;means to contemplate the major and minor marks of a Buddha&#x27;s body without the aid of a physical image. The first comes from the Sutra of Fó shuō guānfó sānmèihǎi jīng 佛說觀佛三昧海經 where the practitioner may choose to select one of the Buddha&#x27;s features or attributes to focus on or contemplate them all simultaneously.&quot; or second that comes from the Zuòchán sānmèi jīng 坐禪三昧經 Sutra where the practitioner contemplates one or all of the four greats (四大) at a time that being earth, wind, fire, water or any other Dhrama. This is also the method for the visually impaired or blind practitioner.
* &quot;Contemplating the true mark&quot; (shíxiàng niàn 實相念), Normally reserved for experienced or advanced practitioners &quot;one contemplates the Buddha&#x27;s dharma body, which is also the contemplation of one&#x27;s own true self and the true nature of all phenomena. This is also based on &quot;The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra Preached by Mañjuśrī&quot;, which describes the Buddha nature as primordial universality as John&#x27;s refers to as a &quot;unproduced and unextinguished, neither going nor coming, without name and without feature. That alone is called &#x27;buddha&#x27;.&quot; 
This schema may have been presented as a progressive path of practice, from easiest to most difficult and profound. While Zōngmì held that the fourth method of nianfo was the most profound, Yúnqī Zhūhóng reversed this progression, arguing that &quot;contemplation of the name&quot; was actually the highest practice and that it was to obtain wisdom and enlightenment in this life more than to be reborn in the Pure land.

Yúnqī Zhūhóng also taught that there were two main mental attitudes that can be applied to practicing nianfo:

* &quot;Phenomenal holding of the name&quot; (shì chí 事 持), which entails concentrating on the individual syllables of the name. This leads to a calm and focused mind, and thus to samadhi and so it is mainly a &quot;calming&quot; (zhǐ 止, samatha) practice.
* &quot;Noumenal holding of the name&quot; (lǐ chí 理持), which shifts the attention to the mind that is holding the name and eventually realizes that the non-duality of oneself and Amitabha. This is a contemplation (guān 觀) practice aimed at wisdom.

====In Japanese Buddhism====
The various Japanese Buddhist traditions practice Pure Land in different ways. In traditions like Sanron and Tendai, nenbutsu (nianfo) is seen as one method among many, to be practiced in conjunction with other Buddhist practices like meditation, rituals, precepts, etc.

The independent Pure Land schools in Japan, especially , have different interpretations of nianfo where they emphasize nianfo and faith or the entrusting heart (shinjin) over and above all other forms of Buddhist practice. They also hold that this idea was taught by the three Chinese Patriarchs of their purported lineage: Tanluan, Daochuo and Shandao. This exclusivity is not supported by the historical evidence which shows that the Chinese patriarchs undertook visualization meditation, scriptural study and other practices. However, even if this is their doctrinal emphasis, Jōdo Shinshū practitioners still engage in other practices, including liturgy, scripture chanting, charity and so on.

===Precepts, meditation and other practices===

Different Pure Land traditions have different approaches to the practice of Buddhist ethical discipline (&quot;sīla&quot;), bodhisattva vows, meditation and other traditional practices such as such as study, repentance rites, worship, sutra chanting, vegetarianism, and monasticism. Generally speaking, Chinese and other mainland Pure Land Buddhists affirm these traditional Buddhist practices, which they see as valid and useful methods of making spiritual progress and generating merit which could be dedicated to rebirth in the Pure Land. This was also partly due to the fact that Pure Land in China was never an independent institutional &quot;school&quot;, but was just seen as a &quot;dharma gate&quot; practiced within various schools that taught a variety of methods. 

Chinese Pure Land authors also had different answers to the question of why we should engage in other classic Buddhist practices (aside from nianfo) if Amitabha Buddha could save all beings no matter how wicked they were. Thus, different Pure Land traditions have different ways to avoid the shared problem of antinomianism, which may arise if someone thinks they are sure to be saved by Amitabha&#x27;s power and so chooses to do evil deeds or avoid all ethical training.

Many Chinese Pure Land masters exhorted their disciples to both practice ethics, vows and so on and chant the nianfo without attempting to answer the question of why they are &quot;both&quot; needed if simple nianfo is sufficient for rebirth in the Pure Land as stated in the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot; (&quot;Amitayurdhyana&quot;). Numerous important Pure Land practitioners were also Vinaya masters and were active in transmitting the precepts.

Chinese masters did give various reasons for why one should do other Buddhist practices including the ethical precepts. Charles B. Jones outlines the following main reasons given in the pre-modern Pure Land literature:

* Wáng Rìxiū (d. 1173) argues that even though the immoral will still gain rebirth, they will be reborn among the lowest grade of rebirth (as stated in the &quot;Contemplation Sutra&quot;), which means their progress to Buddhahood while in Sukhavati will still be much slower than those of more ethical people. Thus, other Buddhist practices still have importance since they determine the quality of one&#x27;s rebirth in Sukhavati. Thus, Yìnguāng writes that he kept the precepts and practiced meditation because he wanted to &quot;attain the necessary qualifications for a superior-level (&quot;shàng pǐn&quot; 上品) rebirth in the Pure Land.&quot;
* The Pure Land is an intermediate goal in Pure Land Buddhism, which merely helps one attain the final goal is full Buddhahood. With this in mind, masters like Yuan Hongdao note that it is important to develop the good roots&quot; (shàn gēn 善根) of merit, since this contributes to the attainment of Buddhahood, &quot;as well as&quot; the attainment of the Pure Land. Indeed, Jones notes that &quot;Yuan says in other places, one&#x27;s very ability to practice Pure Land depends upon having these good roots.&quot;
* According to masters like Yuan Hongdao and Yinguang, the length of time that one spends in the Pure Land before attaining Buddhahood matters, because the faster one attains Buddhahood, the faster one can help all beings as a Buddha. Hence, it makes sense to practice as best as one can now and work for rebirth in the Pure Land as the highest grade possible. Furthermore, other masters like Jixing Chewu state that without the motivation to help all beings, one will not be able to activate the &quot;sympathetic resonance&quot; (&quot;gǎnyìng&quot;) needed for rebirth in the Pure Land since the Buddha&#x27;s mind also resonates with compassion. He also argues that true bodhicitta and compassion for all beings entails the desire to attain Buddhahood as quickly as possible.
The practice of abstaining from eating animals or animal by-products called chún jìng sù (纯净素) in Chinese, translates as pure Buddhist vegetarian/vegan denoting the aspiration and transcendence to higher levels of non violence through physical practice.

===Group practice and rituals===
Group practice, whether in a ritual setting or in retreat, is a common part of modern Pure Land Buddhism. One important form of ritual in Pure Land Buddhism are death rituals. Death is often assigned a special importance in Pure Land Buddhism. This is because the time of death is seen as a key moment were one could either focus the mind on Amitabha and gain rebirth in the Pure Land or become distracted and troubled by worldly things.

According to Jones, one can find descriptions of such rituals in the memoirs of the Ming dynasty Pure Land teacher Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610). The basic goal of these rituals was to &quot;provide the dying person with an environment free from anything that would distract them from focusing on Amitābha and to offer support by practicing alongside them. At its simplest, family members gathered around the bedside and helped the dying person maintain a constant flow of nianfo, sometimes taking over for them if their breath became too weak.&quot; Chinese Buddhists would also be on the lookout for auspicious signs during these rituals, such as visions of Amitabha and bright lights. Over time, deathbed rituals could become very elaborate and funeral specialists developed which focused on these elements of Pure Land practice. They might involve extensive liturgies and works of art depicting Amitabha.

Another form of group practice which is common in Chinese Pure Land Buddhism is the nianfo recitation retreat, where Buddhists come together for intensive recitation practice for several days. These retreats always focus on nianfo recitation (walking or sitting), but might also include chanting of the Pure Land sutras, taking of the eight precepts, silent meditation and Dharma lectures.

Japanese Pure Land Buddhist sects, like Jōdo Shinshū Hongwanji-ha, also perform numerous ritual services for their congregation. Charles B. Jones notes that in this school: &quot;there is an &quot;infant rite&quot; to welcome the birth of a new baby, a &quot;confirmation ceremony&quot; to affirm one&#x27;s commitment to the Jōdo Shinshū and receive a dharma name, a &quot;wedding ceremony&quot; that unites a couple&#x27;s marriage vows with a reaffirmation of their commitment to the way of Amitābha, and, of course, funeral rites to commend loved ones to rebirth in the Pure Land. Individual parishioners may also request special services, such as a home visit during which the minister chants the Smaller Sūtra in front of the family buddha-altar (Jpn.: butsudan), or memorial services to mark the death anniversaries of loved ones.&quot; According to Jōdo Shinshū teaching, while these rituals do not actually contribute to one&#x27;s attainment of the Pure Land (only &quot;shinjin&quot; does), they still promote virtues like self-reflection, awareness, gratitude and humility.

===Sutra and dhāraṇī chanting===

Another common practice in Pure Land Buddhism is the chanting of sutras (especially the three Pure Land sutras). Sutra chanting was one of the auxiliary methods taught by Pure Land patriarchs like Shandao.

The chanting of dhāraṇīs is a similar method. One popular Pure Land dhāraṇī is the &quot;Pure Land Rebirth dhāraṇī&quot; (往生淨土神咒 &quot;Wangsheng Jingtu Shenzhou&quot;) is another method in Pure Land Buddhism. The repetition of this dhāraṇī (which actually refers to two texts, a long and a short one) is said to be very popular among traditional Chinese Buddhists. It is traditionally preserved in Sanskrit, and it is said that when a devotee succeeds in realizing singleness of mind on it, its true and profound meaning will be clearly revealed. The Chinese use a version of this dhāraṇī that was transliterated from Sanskrit into Chinese characters, called the &quot;Mantra for Birth in the Pure Land&quot; (). Another dhāraṇī of Amitabha is the &quot;Dhāraṇī of Holy Infinite-Life Resolute Radiance King Tathāgata&quot; (聖無量壽決定光明王如來陀羅尼). Yet another popular dharani in East Asian Buddhism which is said to lead to birth in Sukhavati is the &quot;Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī Sūtra.&quot;

According to Chinese Pure Land master Yinguang, a Pure Land practitioner can recite any mantra or sutra, such as those which are commonly used in Chinese Mahayana (&quot;Heart Sutra&quot;, &quot;Great Compassion mantra&quot;, and the &quot;Shurangama Mantra&quot;). However, he also notes &quot;to be in accord with the tenets of Pure Land&quot; one should also include nianfo into one&#x27;s recitation practice and also dedicate the merit of the practice to rebirth in the Pure Land.

===Dual practice with Chan===
In Chinese Buddhism, there is a common practice called the &quot;dual path of Chan and Pure Land cultivation&quot;, which is also called the &quot;dual path of emptiness and existence.&quot; As taught by Nan Huai-Chin, the name of Amitābha is recited slowly, and the mind is emptied out after each repetition. When idle thoughts arise, the name is repeated again to clear them. With constant practice, the mind is able to remain peacefully in emptiness, culminating in the attainment of samādhi. Some Chinese masters argued that the practice of Chan by itself was risky, since one did not know if it would bear fruit in this life. Hence, it was better to practice both Chan meditation and nianfo, and in this way, one could at least be ensured of rebirth in the Pure Land. A later development fused the two practices into one, which was called the Pure Land kōan and consisted of practicing nianfo while also asking oneself &quot;Who is performing nianfo?&quot;

Other Chinese meditation masters, particularly in the Chan school, taught nianfo as a secondary method. Thus, while Hānshān Déqīng 憨山德淸 (1546–1623) taught nianfo recitation, he saw is as a lesser practice than Chan meditation proper. Similarly, Chan master Xūyún (1840?–1959) subsumed nianfo under a Chan framework which interprets it as a kind of huàtóu practice.

The method of joint Pure Land and Chan practice was formalized in Korean Buddhism as part of the &quot;Three Gates&quot; (Korean: &quot;sammun&quot;) schema which taught nianfo, Seon meditation and doctrinal study. This system was first articulated by Ch’ongheo Hyujong in the 17th century, who held that the three practices work together.

The eclectic practice of Chan and Pure Land (along with other classic Buddhist practices and rituals) are also a common feature of Vietnamese Buddhism. The dual practice of Zen meditation along with recitation of Amitabha&#x27;s name is also common in the Japanese Ōbaku school of Buddhism.

===Benefits===
Pure Land practice is primarily said to lead to rebirth in Amitabha&#x27;s Pure Land and thus the bodhisattva stage of non-retrogression (since at the point one has reached the Pure Land, one will not fall back from this to a lower realm). This Pure Land is often described as a kind of way station or hostel (lǚguǎn 旅館) outside of the triple world of samsara. It is a place that lacks suffering and which allows someone to practice the bodhisattva path without difficulties. However, Pure Land authors also report other benefits of practicing Pure Land which appear in this life. Benefits include the buddha-contemplation samādhi, purification of the mind, and elimination of bad karma.

Various worldly benefits of nianfo practice have also been reported by Pure Land masters at least since the Song dynasty. For example, when Tiantai master Sìmíng Zhīlǐ (960–1028) organized a Pure Land society, he said that the society&#x27;s practice would &quot;extend the emperor&#x27;s longevity (shòu 壽) and contribute to the prosperity (lù 祿) of the people.&quot; Yinguang said he had been healed of conjunctivitis by the practice. Thus, some traditional Chinese sources use nianfo as a health incantation with numerous benefits. These benefits can be found in sources like &quot;Forty-Eight Ways to Nianfo&quot; (&quot;Niànfó sìshíbā fǎ&quot; 念佛四十八法) by Zhèng Wéiān and other traditional Chinese medical text.

==In Himalayan Buddhism==
In Tibetan Buddhism, which is a Vajrayana tradition, various practices and ideas which are focused on rebirth in the Buddhafield of Amitabha (as well as other Buddhas) exist as part of the vast repertoire of Buddhist practices found in this tradition. These include exoteric (or sutra) and esoteric (or tantric) forms of Buddhist practice focused on the Buddha Amitabha and his buddhafield of Sukhavati&quot;.&quot; Matthew Kapstein writes that &quot;Sukhavati has long been an important focal point for much of Tibetan devotion,&quot; especially among lay devotees who commonly revere Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara and Padmasambhava as three bodies of a single Buddha. He also notes that such an orientation also exists in Nepalese Buddhism.

Georgios T. Halkias notes that the term &quot;Pure Land&quot; can be used in reference to these Tibetan practices and scriptures which are analogous to East Asian Pure Land Buddhist practices. However, he also notes that there has never been a &quot;sectarian, self-conscious movement of Pure Land Buddhism in Tibet&quot; which saw itself as independent of the larger doctrinal and practical worldview of Tibetan Buddhism as a whole. As such, Pure Land practices in Tibetan Buddhism are considered one element or orientation within the broader Himalayan Buddhist tradition.

Pure Land Buddhism in Tibet has a long and innovative history dating from the era of the Tibetan Empire (8th–9th centuries), with the translation of the &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; sūtras into Tibetan. Tibetan documents from Dunhuang also prove that by the 8th and 9th centuries, Sukhavati and Amitabha were important to Tibetan Buddhists. The Tibetan Canon also includes numerous other Sukhavati-Amitabha oriented texts, including various dharanis (incantations/spells) which are believed to lead one to Sukhavati. These include the &quot;Cloud of Offerings Dharani&quot;, &quot;Dharani-Mantra of Amitabha&quot;, &quot;Recollection of Amitabha&quot;, &quot;Dharani of the Essence of Aparimitayus&quot;, &quot;Dharani in Praise of Immeasurable Qualities.&quot; However, there are also many other sources which mention other Pure Lands aside from Sukhavati, which shows that this was not the only Pure Land sought after by Tibetan Buddhists during the first and second disseminations of Buddhism.

===Tibetan works===
Tibetan compositions of pure-land prayers and artistic renditions of Sukhāvatī in Central Asia date to that time. Tibetan pure-land literature forms a distinct genre and encompasses a wide range of texts, including aspirational and devotional prayers for rebirth in Sukhavati (Tib. &quot;bde-smon&quot;), commentaries (&quot;’grel-ba&quot;) by scholars which discuss Pure Land practice, and esoteric meditations and rituals belonging to the Vajrayāna tradition which focus on rebirth in the Pure land and on the deity Amitābha. The composition of Pure Land oriented literature was popular among major Tibetan Buddhist figures. For example, both Sakya Pandita (a key figure for the Sakya school) and Tsongkhapa (the founder of the Gelug school), composed Sukhavati-oriented works.

Tibetan commentaries focusing on Amitabha and Sukhavati, like The First Panchen Lama&#x27;s (1567–1662) &quot;Swift and Unobstructed Path to Sukhavati,&quot; teach methods to attain the Pure Land. In this text, the First Panchen Lama advises that one may use a thangka painting or a statue to help visualize Amitabha in his Pure Land while maintaining a mind oriented towards the good of all beings. The commentary also says that one should infuse all daily activities with this practice.

Another important commentary on Pure Land practice, &quot;Training for Sukhavati with Luminous Faith: Sun-like Instructions of a Sage&quot;, was composed by the Nyingma scholar Ju Mipham (1846–1912). His work is a classic of the genre and draws on numerous other texts to explain how Pure Land practice works through a synthesis of the &quot;ripening force of individual beings&quot; (&quot;sems-can rang-rang gi stobs smin-pa&quot;), the &quot;power of reality&#x27;s potency&quot; (&quot;dngos-po&#x27;i nus-pa&quot;) and the power of Amitābha&#x27;s aspirations (&quot;smon-lam&quot;) and wisdom (&quot;ye-shes&quot;).

According to Mipham, rebirth in Sukhavati is an excellent path to nirvana and is based on four causes: recollecting Buddha Amitabha, accumulating countless virtues, generating bodhicitta, and dedicating one&#x27;s virtues to rebirth in Sukhavati. Recollecting the Buddha with faith and a strong aspiration to be born in Sukhavati are the main causes, while the others are secondary. Mipham also discusses the three major hindrances to birth in Sukhavati: lack of understanding, wrong views and doubt. He also recommends reading, reciting, writing and meditating on the Sukhavati sutras.

Amitabha is generally understood as a specific Buddha, one of the Five Tathagathas, some of the most prominent Buddhas in the tradition. However, in some Tibetan Buddhist writings, Amitabha is equated with the Dharmakaya and with the Dzogchen concept of the basis or ground (gzhi). For example, the great 19th century Dzogchen master Dudjom Lingpa (&quot;khrag &#x27;thung bdud &#x27;joms rdo rje&quot;), writes: &quot;Emaho, in the self-manifest, pure expanse that is the real Akanistha, the magical field that is gnosis arrayed, is the Dharmakaya of the ground, the conqueror Amitabha.&quot; Thus, Matthew Kapstein writes that in this Dzogchen understanding of Amitabha, Sukhavati is &quot;no longer the name of a particular paradise, but rather a metonymic expression for the primordial ground in which the Buddha&#x27;s gnosis is disclosed.&quot;

===Tibetan practices===
It seems that from the 11th century onwards, Amitabha and Sukhavati became increasingly popular, and this pure land became the most widespread destination sought by Pure Land rituals and contemplations. Amitabha-focused tantric practices seem to have become widespread at least partly due to the efforts of the Indian tantric scholar Jitāri / Jetari. One of these practices was popularized by the Sakya school and was a contemplation that one performed just before falling asleep, in which one visualized Sukhavati and the Buddha Amitabha. This &quot;sleep-meditation&quot; (nyal-bsgom) continues to be transmitted in the Sakya school until the present day.

One of the simplest popular practices which Tibetan Buddhists consider to lead to rebirth in Sukhavati is the recitation of the six syllable mantra (om mani padme hum) of Avalokitesvara. According to Lama Zopa, this mantra can lead to Avalokitesvara&#x27;s Potala Pure Land or Sukhavati.

Pure Land works based on Amitabha are found in various other Tibetan textual collections, such as in the compositions of Tibetan masters like Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292–1361), Namchö Mingyur Dorje (1645–1667) and Karma Chagme (1613–1678). Dolpopa is known to have written a commentary on the Larger &quot;Sukhāvatīvyuha sutra&quot; entitled &quot;The supreme means whereby self and others may be reborn in Sukhāvatī.&quot; According to Georgios T. Halkias, Mingyur Dorje&#x27;s Namcho Terma Cycle &quot;contains a unique assortment of ritual practices devoted exclusively to the realization of Sukhāvatī&quot; called &quot;The Means of Attaining the Sukhāvatī Kṣetra,&quot; which &quot;represents the most original and systematic anthology of Tibetan Pure Land rituals to date.&quot; This terma includes phowa practices and extensive visualization exercises where the main mandala is Sukhavati.

The esoteric practice of &quot;phowa&quot; (mind transference, Sanskrit: &quot;*saṃkrānti&quot;) is a unique part of Tibetan Pure Land practice which is found in various terma (revealed treasure) works like &quot;The Standing Blade of Grass&quot; (Tib. &quot;″Pho-ba ″Jag-tshug ma&quot;) by the Nyingma master Nyida Sangye (14th century) and Namchö Mingyur Dorje&#x27;s Namcho Terma. Phowa is an esoteric technique which ejects the mind stream through the crown of the head directly to Sukhavati at the moment of death. This technique is found as one of the Six Dharmas of Naropa. Since phowa specialists are said to be able to guide the minds of other people at death to Sukhavati, phowa also became a popular ritual that came to be performed for the dying by lamas.

Another important tradition in Tibetan Buddhism are tantric practices based around Amitayus (another name for Amitabha, meaning Infinite Life) which focuses on the longevity and life-giving powers of this Buddha.

There are many other treasure texts (termas) associated with Pure Land practice and tertön Longsal Nyingpo (1625–1682/92 or 1685–1752) of Katok Monastery revealed a terma on the pure land.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 2002 was the 47th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Tallinn, Estonia, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Everybody&quot; by Tanel Padar, Dave Benton and 2XL. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (ETV), the contest was held at the Saku Suurhall on 25 May 2002. The contest was presented by Estonian opera singer Annely Peebo and actor Marko Matvere. It was the first Eurovision Song Contest held in one of the former Soviet republics.

Twenty-four countries participated in the contest. , , , , , , and returned after their relegation from the previous edition. , , , , and were relegated due to their poor results in 2001.

This would go on to be very fortunate for the country as ended up winning the contest with the song &quot;I Wanna&quot;, performed by Marie N who wrote it with Marats Samauskis. , the , , and rounded out the top five. Malta achieved their best result in their Eurovision history, coming second. Further down the table, finished twenty-fourth and last, their worst result up until that point, despite having been declared one of the favourites to win the competition beforehand.

== Location ==

Tallinn is the capital and largest city of Estonia. It is situated on the northern coast of the country, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland, south of Helsinki in Finland. Tallinn&#x27;s Old Town is one of the best preserved and intact medieval cities in Europe and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=== Venue ===
Early in the proceedings, media outlets had begun speculating whether (ETV) would be able to host the contest, citing a lack of a suitable venue and budgetary concerns. Due to this, Maltese broadcaster Public Broadcasting Services (PBS) and Dutch broadcaster (NOS) both expressed interest in hosting in the event in respective countries instead of Estonia. However, worries were put to rest when a combination of fundraising activities and the Estonian Government enabled them to host the event.

On 19 June 2001, it was announced that Estonia would still host the 2002 contest. The Saku Suurhall was ultimately chosen as the venue for the contest. It is the largest indoor arena in Estonia, built in 2001 and holds up to 10,000 people. It is named after the Estonian brewery and soft drink company Saku.

== Participating countries ==
The total number of participants had originally been 22, but when the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) increased the number of participants for the contest to 24, this granted Israel and Portugal, which finished 16th and 17th in , the opportunity to enter. Portugal declined to enter the contest due to internal problems in the Portuguese broadcaster (RTP). This allowed eventual winner Latvia, who finished 18th in 2001, to enter. Despite finishing in joint 18th place with the Netherlands in 2001, tiebreaking rules put Latvia higher due to receiving more sets of 8 points.

A total of 24 countries competed in the 2002 contest, which included the 16 top placing countries from the previous year&#x27;s contest and Latvia, alongside the seven returning countries, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, Macedonia, Romania, and Switzerland, which had been relegated from competing in the 2001 contest. These seven countries replaced the bottom 5 countries from the 2001 contest - Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, and Poland, all of which were relegated from taking part in this year&#x27;s contest, as well as Portugal, who decided not to compete.

Draw for the running order took place on 9 November 2001.

Several of the performing artists had previously competed in past editions. Constantinos Christoforou, a member of One, had represented ; while Philippos Constantinos, another member of the band, had provided backing vocals for . Jody Pijper, a member of Sergio and the Ladies representing Belgium, had provided backing vocals for the , , , and ; while Ingrid Simons, another member of the band, had provided backing vocals for the .

In addition, Christina Argyri, who represented as part of Voice, and Kenny Lübcke, who represented with Lotte Nilsson, provided backing vocals for the same country.

== Format ==
For the first time, a slogan (or theme) was implemented. This year&#x27;s theme was called &#x27;A Modern Fairytale&#x27;, which was evident in the postcards shown between the songs, which showed classic fairytales ending in modern Estonian situations.

The postcards continued with the opening theme of &quot;A Modern Fairytale&quot; taking well known fairy tales and translating them into Estonian life through short films, with a moral at the end of each one of them.

== Detailed voting results ==

According to the EBU rules, every broadcaster was free to make a choice between the full televoting system and the mixed 50-50 system. In exceptional circumstances, where televoting was not possible at all, only a jury was used. In the EBU&#x27;s rules for the 2002 contest, it was stated; &quot;In the televoting, households shall not be permitted to vote more than three times&quot;.

At this contest (and the following one) the broadcaster decided to reverse the song recaps - starting instead with the last performed song (24) and finishing with the first performed song (1). This was due to the apparent preference within public vote for songs in the later part of the running order in comparison to the songs nearer to the start.

<text>The Alyeska consortium refers to the major oil companies that own and operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) through the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company.

==History==
The Alaska corporation commonly known as Alyeska Pipeline Company was founded in 1970 to design, construct, operate and maintain a pipeline to transport oil from the fields on the North Slope of Alaska where oil was discovered in 1968 to an ice-free deep-water port in Valdez, Alaska. The pipeline was built between March 1975 and June 1977, running from the North Slope fields at Prudhoe Bay to the Marine Terminal at Valdez on Prince William Sound. Alyeska then went on to operate and maintain TAPS. The first oil flowed into the pipeline on June 20, 1977, and the first tanker load departed from Valdez on August 1, 1977.

&quot;Totem Marine Tug &amp; Barge, Inc. v. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.&quot; was argued before the Alaska Supreme Court in 1978.

The Alyeska Pipeline Service Company was partially responsible for helping to respond to the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill. However, Alyeska Pipeline was unprepared for the events, and consequently slow to respond with cleanup crews and equipment. Additionally, shortly before the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; spill, Alyeska had persuaded the Coast Guard that some safety equipment was not necessary on tankers---equipment that may have reduced the scale of the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; disaster. September 2017 Alyeska had another spill due to a mix up of piping by long time employees, and dispensed anywhere from 9.5 to 38 barrels of product into the narrows of Valdez.

The thirty-year TAPS State and Federal land leases were due to expire in 2004. The State Lease was renewed for another thirty years on November 26, 2002, and a matching Federal Record of Decision for Right-of-Way was signed on January 8, 2003.

In 2019, it was announced that BP would be selling its shares in Alyeska to Houston-based Hilcorp.

==Organization==
The major owner of the company is Hilcorp with 46.93% of the shares dating from the acquisition of BP. The other group members are ConocoPhillips Transportation (shares formerly owned by ARCO and acquired by Phillips during its acquisition of ARCO Alaska as part of the settlement between BP and the FTC) (28.29%), ExxonMobil (20.34%), Koch Alaska Pipeline Company (3.08%), and Unocal (1.36%). The government responsibility in regulating TAPS is managed through the Joint Pipeline Office (, JPO), a consortium of thirteen federal and state agencies under the Department of the Interior.

The corporation is named after an Aleut word meaning &quot;mainland&quot;. It is headquartered in Anchorage and has around 900 employees.

<doc id="197725" wikidata="Q1938740" url="?curid=197725" title="Nils Ericson">
<text>&quot;Friherre&quot; Nils Ericson (born Nils Ericsson; 31 January 1802 – 8 September 1870) was a Swedish mechanical engineer who built canals and railways in Sweden. His younger brother John Ericsson, who emigrated first to England and then the United States, was also an engineer.

He was raised to the untitled nobility by king Oscar I of Sweden in 1854, and with this he reverted to a spelling of his surname with only one &quot;s&quot;. In 1859 he was made a Friherre (equivalent to English Baron), the 403rd such elevation to Sweden&#x27;s titled nobility.

==Background==
John and Nils were born in Långbanshyttan, Värmland, Sweden, and received no formal education, but were taught the rudiments of mechanics from an early age by their father, Olof Ericsson. Olof worked as the superintendent of a mine in Värmland until he lost money in speculations and had to move his family to Forsvik, Västergötland, in 1810. There Olaf became a director of blastings during the excavation of Sweden&#x27;s Göta Canal (built 1810–1832). He secured permission for his sons to draw in the office of the draughtsmen of the canal company, where they also learned to draw maps, and he persuaded Lieutenant Brandenburg of the Navy Mechanical Corps to teach them the art of shading and &#x27;finishing off&#x27; mechanical drawings before they were in their teens.

Their extraordinary skills were noted and written about by Baltzar von Platen, the architect of the Göta Canal, and they were soon dubbed cadets of mechanics of the Swedish Navy and engaged as trainees at the canal enterprise. When two engineers sent to England by Count Platen to obtain information about canal construction returned in 1815 and began to instruct a number of cadets of the Swedish Corps of Mechanical Engineers, the Ericsson brothers were among them; Nils being then twelve years old and John eleven.

==Career==

In 1823 Nils Ericson joined the Engineering corps of the Swedish Army as a second lieutenant, but in 1830 he transferred to the Navy Mechanical Corps (where he eventually advanced to the rank of colonel in 1850). In 1833 he married a daughter of Count von Schwerin in Östergötland.

Between 1830 and 1850 Nils Ericson planned and directed the construction of the canals at Stallbacka, Säffle, Karlstad and Albrektsund. He also led the construction of the Saimaa Canal in Finland (constructed 1845–52), the reconstruction of the Trollhätte Canal in Trollhättan Municipality and the locks at Slussen in Stockholm. In 1845, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

After 1850 he was primarily occupied with the design and construction of the Swedish state-owned railway system. At the same time he led the planning of the Dalsland Canal while construction there was being led by his son Werner.

Sweden started building railways later than many other European countries, having hesitated under heavy debate for several years because of the costs and other issues. Following the Riksdag&#x27;s decision in 1854, Erikson was chosen to lead the project of building the main lines (stambanorna). There was also a decision that, for military reasons, the railways should avoid the coasts as much as possible.

His proposal was that the line between Gothenburg and Stockholm (Western Main Line, &quot;Västra stambanan&quot;) should run south of Lake Mälaren to avoid competition with shipping. He also proposed that the line between Malmö and Stockholm (Southern Main Line, &quot;Södra stambanan&quot;) should go north via Nässjö to meet up with Western Main Line at Falköping until the Western&#x27;s eastward construction reached Katrineholm, where a better junction could be built with a southern line heading directly to Nässjö. This line was called Eastern Main Line (&quot;Östra stambanan&quot;) but has in modern times been defined to be part of the Southern Main Line. Ericson&#x27;s proposal also included the railway between Stockholm and Ånge (Northern Main Line, &quot;Norra stambanan&quot;) and Main Line Through Upper Norrland (&quot;Stambanan genom övre Norrland&quot;) which runs between Bräcke and Boden. A railway between Oslo and Laxå (Northwestern Main Line, &quot;Nordvästra stambanan&quot;) was also planned, to connect with Western Main Line.

The first parts of the Western and Southern lines were opened in 1856. Ericson resigned in 1862 when all of the Western line opened, and in 1864 the Southern line was opened in its entirety. Northwestern line was opened in 1871, Eastern line in 1874, Northern line in 1881 and the line through Upper Norrland in 1894. When Ericson resigned in 1862 his authority was divided between two agencies (the Building Bureau and the Traffic Bureau) until the formation of Kungliga Järnvägsstyrelsen (the Royal Railway Committee) in 1888.

Ericson died in Stockholm in 1870, aged 68, and lies buried in Stockholm&#x27;s Northern Cemetery (Norra begravningsplatsen).

<doc id="197727" wikidata="Q1121983" url="?curid=197727" title="University of Greenland">
<text>The University of Greenland (; ) is Greenland&#x27;s only university. It is in the capital city of Nuuk. Most courses are taught in Danish, a few in Greenlandic and classes by exchange lecturers often in English.

The university had an enrollment of 205 students in 2018, composed of mostly Greenlandic inhabitants. It has around fourteen academic staff and five technical-administrative employees. The modest student population is due, in part, to most Greenlandic students going to universities in Denmark.

==History==
The University of Greenland was established in 1987 to provide local higher education for Greenland. It was originally located in the former Moravian mission station of Neu Herrnhut, and moved into a dedicated research complex, Ilimmarfik, in 2009. The university has a DKK 14.8 million budget.

== Institutes ==

The university has multiple programs:

* Teacher training and education science (broad programmes)
* Humanities (broad programmes)
* Social and behavioural science (broad programmes)
* Business and administration (broad programmes)
* Law (broad programmes)
* Health (broad programmes)
* Social services (broad programmes)

Focus areas: 
* Greenlandic culture and history
* Greenlandic political system
* Greenlandic literature and media
* Health science in the Arctic
* Climate and society

The university awards baccalaureate degrees in all departments and Master&#x27;s Degrees in all areas except theology. Doctorate programmes are also offered.

==Rector==
Tia became director of Ilisimatusarfik at the beginning of 2009 after the former rector, Ole Marquardt, resigned in protest over new administrative laws introduced to the university in 2007.

==Guest faculty==
Due to the small number of faculty, many specialized classes are offered by guest faculty, often coming from Danish universities, but also coming from other countries. 
Guest faculty at Ilisimatusarfik are often specialists for research on Greenland, combining teaching at Ilisimatusarfik with their research while staying on Greenland.

== Library ==
The university library holds approximately 30,000 volumes.

The form is defined by intense player involvement with a story that takes place in real time and evolves according to players&#x27; responses. It is shaped by characters that are actively controlled by the game&#x27;s designers, as opposed to being controlled by an AI as in a computer or console video game. Players interact directly with characters in the game, solve plot-based challenges and puzzles, and collaborate as a community to analyze the story and coordinate real-life, online activities and AI out of control. ARGs generally utilize multimedia, such as telephones and mail, but rely on the Internet as the central binding medium.

ARGs tend to be free to play, with costs absorbed either through supporting products (e.g., collectible puzzle cards fund Perplex City) or through promotional relationships with existing products (for example, &quot;I Love Bees&quot; was a promotion for &quot;Halo 2&quot;, and the &quot;Lost Experience&quot; and &quot;Find 815&quot; promoted the television show &quot;Lost&quot;). Pay-to-play models exist as well. Later games in the genre have shown an increasing amount of experimentation with new models and sub-genres.

== Definition ==
There is a great deal of debate surrounding the characteristics by which the term &quot;alternate reality game&quot; should be defined. Sean Stacey, the founder of the website Unfiction, has suggested that the best way to define the genre was &quot;not&quot; to define it, and instead locate each game on three axes (ruleset, authorship and coherence) in a sphere of &quot;chaotic fiction&quot; that would include works such as the Uncyclopedia and street games like SF0 as well.

Several experts, though, point to the use of transmedia, &quot;the aggregate effect of multiple texts/media artifacts,&quot; as the defining attribute of ARGs. This prompts the unique collaboration emanating from ARGs as well; Sean Stewart, founder of 42 Entertainment, which has produced various successful ARGs, speaks to how this occurs, noting that &quot;the key thing about an ARG is the way it jumps off of all those platforms. It&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s social and comes at you across all the different ways that you connect to the world around you.&quot;

Most ARGs do not have any fixed rules—players discover the rules and the boundaries of the game through trial and error—and do not require players to assume fictional identities or roleplay beyond feigning belief in the reality of the characters they interact with (even if games where players play &#x27;themselves&#x27; are a long-standing variant on the genre).

== Scholarly views ==
Overall, academics have been intrigued by ARGs&#x27; potential for effective organizing. Across the board, a diverse range of organizations, such as businesses, nonprofits, government agencies, and schools &quot;can learn from the best practices and lessons of ARGs to similarly take advantage of new media and collective problem–solving&quot;. As such, implementation of ARGs in these different settings involves finding best practices for honing the collaborative, transmedia elements of ARGs for these respective institutions.

Much of this scholarly interest stems from the evolving media ecology with the rise of new media. In sustaining cooperative online communities, ARGs build on &quot;an alignment of interest, where problems are presented in a fashion that assists game designers in their goal while intriguing and aiding players in their goals&quot;. This returns to ARGs&#x27; framework of transmedia storytelling, which necessitates that ARG designers relinquish a significant degree of their power to the ARG&#x27;s audience, problematizing traditional views of authorship.

The majority of the scholarly review on ARGs analyzes their pedagogical advantages. Notably, in the classroom, ARGs can be effective tools for providing exigence on given topics and yield a collaborative and experiential learning environment. By the same token, weaknesses of classroom learning through ARGs include the need for a flexible narrative conducive to collaborative learning in large groups and a sophisticated web design.

In a contribution to a volume focusing on play and cities in Springer&#x27;s &quot;Gaming Media and Social Effects&quot; series, Eddie Duggan (2017) provides an overview of pervasive games, and discusses characteristics in ARGs, LARPs, RPGs, assassination games and other games where the notion of the &quot;magic circle&quot; as elaborated by Salen and Zimmerman is confounded.

== Development and history ==
=== Early examples ===
&quot;Ong&#x27;s Hat / Incunabula&quot; was most likely started sometime around 1993, and also included most of the aforementioned design principles. &quot;Ong&#x27;s Hat&quot; also incorporated elements of legend tripping into its design, as chronicled in a scholarly work titled &quot;Legend-Tripping Online: Supernatural Folklore and the Search for Ong&#x27;s Hat&quot;. Some scholars disagree on the classification of the &quot;Ong&#x27;s Hat&quot; story.

In 1997, a year prior to the release of Douglas Adams&#x27; computer game &quot;Starship Titanic&quot;, The Digital Village launched a website purporting to be that of an intergalactic travel agency called Starlight Travel, which in the game is the Starship Titanic&#x27;s parent company. The site combined copious amounts of Monty Python-esque writing (by Michael Bywater) with ARG-type interactivity.

=== &quot;The Beast&quot; ===

In 2001, in order to market the movie &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; directed by Steven Spielberg that finished Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s unfinished project to adapt Brian Aldiss&#x27;s short story &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot;, and also a planned series of Microsoft computer games based on the film, Microsoft&#x27;s Creative Director Jordan Weisman and another Microsoft game designer, Elan Lee, conceived of an elaborate murder mystery played out across hundreds of websites, email messages, faxes, fake ads, and voicemail messages. They hired Sean Stewart, an award-winning science fiction/fantasy author, to write the story and Pete Fenlon, an experienced adventure game &quot;worldbuilder&quot;, to serve as developer and content lead. The game, dubbed &quot;the Citizen Kane of online entertainment&quot; by Internet Life, was a runaway success that involved over three million active participants from all over the world during its run and would become the seminal example of the nascent ARG genre. An early asset list for the project contained 666 files, prompting the game&#x27;s puppet-masters to dub it &quot;the Beast&quot;, a name which was later adopted by players. A large and extremely active fan community called the Cloudmakers formed to analyze and participate in solving the game, and the combined intellect, tenacity and engagement of the group soon forced the puppet-masters to create new subplots, devise new puzzles, and alter elements of the design to keep ahead of the player base. Somewhat unusual for a computer-based game, the production drew players from a wide spectrum of age groups and backgrounds.

Although the Beast ran for only three months, it prompted the formation of a highly organized and intensely engaged community that remained active years after the game concluded. Perhaps more significantly, it inspired a number of its participants to create games adapting and expanding the model, extending it from an anomalous one-time occurrence to a new genre of entertainment and allowing the community to grow even after the Beast itself concluded. Members of the Cloudmakers group went on to form ARGN, the primary news source for the genre, and Unfiction, its central community hub, as well as designing the first successful and widely played indie ARGs, such as LockJaw and Metacortechs, and corporate efforts such as Perplex City.

=== &quot;Portal&quot; (video game franchise) ===
On March 1 and March 3 of 2010, Portal was updated to include a promotional ARG for its then-upcoming sequel, Portal 2. It was created by the &quot;Portal 2&quot; development team, and while it was mostly made to discover the next entry in the &quot;Portal&quot; franchise, it also included a way to extend the &quot;Portal&quot; universe. &quot;Portal&quot; was updated at 2:33 PST, with the update&#x27;s description reading &quot;Changed radio transmission frequency to comply with federal and state spectrum management regulations&quot;. The update also added a single achievement, named &quot;Transmission Received&quot;. The update added 26 portable radios placed throughout the game&#x27;s levels, which played a default song until placed in a specific location in their respective maps. When placed in their location, the radio&#x27;s lights changed from red to green, and they began to emit a string of Morse code, which revealed hidden images when decoded with Robot 36. The numbers from the images form the BBS phone number &quot;(425) 822-5251&quot; and when you dial into the BBS it will prompt the user asking for a login. Entering the username &quot;backup&quot; and the password &quot;backup&quot; (from the 12th audio file) will show text saying &quot;Aperture Laboratories GLaDOS v3.11&quot;, followed by &quot;Copyright (c) 1973–1997 Aperture – All Rights Reserved&quot; then will proceed to show the user ASCII art images and paragraphs quoting Cave Johnson. If the person is idle for 4 minutes, the following text will say &quot;Hey! Please login now. You have one minute left.&quot; and if left idle for one more minute the next text will say &quot;Your login time (5 minutes) ran out. Goodbye&quot;, disconnecting the user.

&quot;Portal&quot; was updated again on March 3, 2010, at 2:24 PST with the description &quot;Added valuable asset retrieval&quot;, The game ending was retconned to add the Party Escort bot, who dragged the player back into the enrichment center rather than allowing them to escape. setting up the events of &quot;Portal 2&quot;.

=== Community and genre growth ===
Influenced heavily by the Beast and enthusiastic about the power of collaboration, several Cloudmakers came together with the idea that they could create a similar game. The first effort to make an independent Beast-like game, &quot;Ravenwatchers&quot;, failed, but another team soon assembled and met with greater success. With very little experience behind them, the group managed, after nine months of development, to create a viable game that was soon seized upon eagerly by the Cloudmakers group and featured in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

=== Gathering worldwide gamers ===

Because of their similarities, video games and ARGs continued to be associated through many projects, In 2009, Funcom, a game development studio from Oslo, Norway, hid a gate on its corporate website, which led to an ARG which would be part of the pre-launch campaign for &quot;The Secret World&quot;, a game released in 2013. The gate was discovered only in 2013, therefore requiring the puppet-master to adapt the scenario to its actual setting.

Funcom has done a total of 16 ARGs that tie in with &quot;The Secret World&quot;, with the first one starting in May 2007. The ARGs focussed on several different storylines, such as: The Expedition of Roald Amundsen, The Sanctuary of Secrets and the Secret War.

The company behind Funcom&#x27;s last 2 ARGs, Human Equation, a Montreal-based entertainment studio who also created an independent ARG called &quot;Qadhos&quot;, has even further purchased the rights to a special class of characters, The Black Watchmen, to create their own independent ARG. A spin-off of Human Equation, Alice &amp; Smith, released the game in June 2015.

=== Massive-scale commercial games and mainstream attention ===
After the success of the first major entries in the nascent ARG genre, a number of large corporations looked to ARGs to both promote their products, and to enhance their companies&#x27; images by demonstrating their interest in innovative and fan-friendly marketing methods. To create buzz for the launch of the Xbox game &quot;Halo 2&quot;, Microsoft hired the team that had created the Beast, now operating independently as 42 Entertainment. The result, &quot;I Love Bees&quot;, departed radically from the website-hunting and puzzle-solving that had been the focus of the Beast. &quot;I Love Bees&quot; wove together an interactive narrative set in 2004, and a &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;-style radio drama set in the future, the latter of which was broken into 30–60-second segments and broadcast over ringing payphones worldwide. The game pushed players outdoors to answer phones, create and submit content, and recruit others, and received as much or a more mainstream notice than its predecessor, finding its way onto television during a presidential debate, and becoming one of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ catchphrases of 2004.

As such, &quot;I Love Bees&quot; captivated enough fans to garner significant press attention, and partly because of this publicity, &quot;Halo 2&quot; &quot;sold $125 million in copies the first day of release.&quot; A slew of imitators fan tributes and parodies followed. In 2005, a pair of articles profiling 42 Entertainment appeared in &quot;Game Developer&quot; magazine and the East Bay Express, both of which tied into an ARG created by the journalist and his editors.

The following spring, Audi launched &quot;The Art of the Heist&quot;, developed by Audi ad agency McKinney+Silver, Haxan Films (creators of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;), to promote its new A3.

Roughly a year after &quot;I Love Bees&quot;, 42 Entertainment produced &quot;Last Call Poker,&quot; a promotion for Activision&#x27;s video game &quot;Gun&quot;. Designed to help modern audiences connect with the Western genre, &quot;Last Call Poker&quot; centered on a working poker site, held games of &quot;Tombstone Hold &#x27;Em&quot; in cemeteries around the United States—as well as in at least one digital venue, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;″s own virtual reality cemetery – and sent players to their own local cemeteries to clean up neglected grave sites and perform other tasks.

At the end of 2005, the International Game Developers Association ARG Special Interest Group was formed &quot;to bring together those already designing, building, and running ARGs, in order to share knowledge, experience, and ideas for the future.&quot; More recently, an ARG was created by THQ for the game &quot;&quot; around peak oil theories where the world is in a crisis over diminishing oil resources.

In 2008, the American Art Museum hosted an alternate reality game, called &quot;Ghosts of a Chance&quot;, which was created by City Mystery. The game allowed patrons &quot;a new way of engaging with the collection&quot; in the Luce Foundation Center. The game ran for six weeks and attracted more than 6,000 participants.

=== Rise of the self-supporting ARG ===
The first major attempt (other than EA&#x27;s failed &quot;Majestic&quot;) to create a self-supporting ARG was &quot;Perplex City&quot;, which launched in 2005 after a year&#x27;s worth of teasers. The ARG offered a $200,000 prize to the first player to locate the buried Receda Cube and was funded by the sale of puzzle cards. The first season of the game ended in January 2007, when Andy Darley found the Receda Cube at Wakerly Great Wood in Northamptonshire, UK. Mind Candy, the production company, has also produced a board game related to the ARG and plans to continue it with a second season beginning 1 March 2007. This model was delayed till 1 June, and has again, been delayed to an unspecified date. Mind Candy&#x27;s acceptance of corporate sponsorship and venture capital suggests that the puzzle cards alone are not enough to fully fund the ARG at this time.

In June 2006, Catching the Wish launched from an in-game website about comic books based on its predecessor, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Chasing the Wish&quot;. 42 Entertainment released &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Book&quot;, by Sean Stewart and Jordan Weisman, in October 2006, shifting the central medium of this ARG from the internet to the printed page. The young-adult novel contains an &quot;evidence packet&quot; and expands its universe through websites and working phone numbers, but is also a stand-alone novel that essentially functions as an individually playable ARG. Neither the cost of creating the book nor sales figures are available (although it made both American and British bestseller lists) to determine whether the project was successfully self-funded.

=== Serious ARG ===
In a 2007 article, columnist Chris Dahlen (of Pitchfork Media) voiced a much-discussed ARG concept: if ARGs can spark players to solve very hard fictional problems, could the games be used to solve real-world problems? Dahlen was writing about &quot;World Without Oil&quot;, the first ARG centered on a serious near-future scenario: a global oil shortage. 

In October 2008 The British Red Cross created a serious ARG called Traces of Hope to promote their campaign about civilians caught up in conflict.

The USC School of Cinematic Arts has run a semester-long ARG called Reality Ends Here for incoming freshmen since 2011. The game involves players collaborating and competing to produce media artifacts. In 2012, Reality Ends Here won the Impact Award at IndieCade, presented to games which &quot;have social message, shift the cultural perception of games as a medium, represent a new play paradigm, expand the audience, or influence culture.&quot;

The Plan of Gauss was a game developed as a didactic strategy to enhance the learning and understanding of mathematics in university students. In this game, the players had to help characters (students) to find a missing friend.

=== New developments ===
In February 2007, Microsoft published the game &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; to promote the launch of Windows Vista. The game was designed by 42 Entertainment and, due in part to many large-scale real-world events, such as a lavish show at the Bellagio Fountain in Las Vegas as well as a prizes of a trip into space and having a winner&#x27;s name engraved on all AMD Athlon 64 FX chips for a certain period of time, received large media attention. 
A few days later, another ARG by 42 Entertainment was released, for the release of the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;Year Zero&quot;. In that ARG, fans discovered leaked songs on thumb drives in washrooms at concerts, as well as clues to websites that describe a dystopian future occurring in 2022. 

Perplex City concluded its first season by awarding a $200,000 prize to a player who found the game&#x27;s missing cube. They planned to continue the ARG into a second &quot;season&quot; under the name Perplex City Stories without a large grand prize, but it was ultimately cancelled.

In May 2007, 42 Entertainment launched &quot;Why So Serious&quot;, an ARG to promote the feature film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. It played out over 15 months, concluding in July 2008. Millions of players in 177 countries participated both online and taking part in live events, and it reached hundreds of millions through Internet buzz and exposure. Notably, &quot;Why So Serious&quot; prompted a great deal of collaborative organizing and action; players went to the streets campaigning for Harvey Dent and gathered in New York City as a part of gameplay.

In March 2008, McDonald&#x27;s and the IOC launched &quot;Find The Lost Ring&quot;, a global ARG promoting the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. The game was run simultaneously in six languages with new story lines developing in each, encouraging players to communicate with residents of other countries to facilitate sharing of clues and details of the game as a whole. American track and field athlete Edwin Moses acted as a celebrity Game Master, and McDonald&#x27;s Corporation promised to donate US$100,000 to Ronald McDonald House Charities China on behalf of the players.

On 1 March 2010, &quot;Valve&quot; released an update via &quot;Steam&quot; to their game &quot;Portal&quot;, adding a nondescript new achievement and some .wav files hidden within the game GCFs. The .wav files actually contained morse code and SSTV encoded images, some including certain numbers and letters. When pieced together in the correct order, these numbers and letters formed a 32-bit MD5 hash of a BBS phone number. When traced, it was found to originate from Kirkland, Washington, where Valve was based before moving to Bellevue, Washington in 2003. Accessing the number as a bulletin board system yielded large ASCII art images, all leading towards the announcement of the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Portal 2&quot;. Later, prior to release of &quot;Portal 2&quot; in 2011, a much more expansive ARG called the &quot;Potato Sack&quot; was run, arranged by a number of independent developers working with Valve, to simulate the re-booting of GLaDOS. The ARG resulted in the game being released several hours earlier than scheduled, among other details.

Also launched in March 2010, an ARG produced by David Varela at nDreams featured the 2008 Formula 1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton; entitled &quot;Lewis Hamilton: Secret Life&quot;, the game ran throughout the 2010 Formula 1 season, in nine languages, with live events in a dozen cities around the world.

In July 2013, Walt Disney Imagineering Research &amp; Development and The Walt Disney Studios launched The Optimist, built around &quot;a story of Walt Disney, the Imagineers, and other visionary thinkers and their potential involvement in a secret project that sought to build a better future.&quot; The game culminated at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, Calif., August 9–11, 2013. Players participated over a six-week period, using social media, mobile devices, and apps, while visiting locations from the story in and around Los Angeles.

An ARG accompanying the Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Frog Fractions 2&quot; began in March 2014 and completed in 2016. &quot;Frog Fractions 2&quot; will be the sequel to Twinbeard Studio&#x27;s much acclaimed &quot;Frog Fractions&quot;, although the ARG itself is often referred to as &quot;Frog Fractions 1.5&quot; in reference to an in-ARG puzzle solution. The ARG took about two years to solve, involving clues buried in 23 independent games and real-life locations, allowing the game, secretly already uploaded under the guise of a different game, to become unlocked in December 2016.

On the release of the expansion &quot;Afterbirth&quot; for &quot;The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth&quot; in October 2015, players discover clues hinting towards an ARG related to the game, based on the community&#x27;s previous attempts to hack the game to discover any secret characters. The ARG included location information near Santa Cruz, California, where the game&#x27;s developer Edmund McMillen lived. The ARG was successfully completed in November 2015, with the community working together and enabling a new character and additional content to be unlocked for the game.

&quot;Inscryption&quot;, a video game by Daniel Mullins based on a metafiction narrative, including a post-game ARG that involved real-world clues and references to Mullins&#x27; past games in conjunction with in-game materials, leading to additional narrative and endings for the game.

In December 2020, a long-unsolved puzzle from Perplex City, &quot;Billion to One&quot;, was solved. The puzzle focused on exploring the concept of Six degrees of separation by presenting a man&#x27;s photograph and his first name, &quot;Satoshi&quot;, asking players to locate him. In 2020, Tom-Lucas Säger used image recognition software and located Satoshi, reporting it to Laura E. Hall, who ran the website tracking information about the hunt. 

==== Television tie-ins and &quot;extended experiences&quot; ====
In 2006, the TV tie-in ARG began to come into its own when there was a surge of ARGs that extended the worlds of related television shows onto the Internet and into the real world. As with &quot;Push, Nevada&quot;, ABC led the way, launching three TV tie-in ARGs in 2006: &quot;Kyle XY&quot;, Ocular Effect (for the show &quot;Fallen&quot;) and The Lost Experience (for the show &quot;Lost&quot;). ABC joined with Channel 4 in the UK and Australia&#x27;s Channel 7 in promoting a revamped website for The Hanso Foundation. The site was focused on a fictitious company prevalent in the storyline of the TV series, and the game was promoted through television advertisements run during &quot;Lost&quot; episodes. The Fallen Alternate Reality Game was launched in tandem with the &quot;Fallen&quot; TV movie for ABC Family and was originally conceived by Matt Wolf and created by Matt Wolf (Double Twenty Productions) in association with Xenophile Media. Wolf accepted the Emmy for The Fallen Alternate Reality Game at the 59th Annual Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards on September 8, 2007.

In January 2008, BBC launched &quot;Whack the Mole&quot; for the CBBC show &quot;M.I. High&quot;, in which viewers are asked to become M.I. High field agents and complete tasks to capture a mole that has infiltrated the organization.

On 16 March 2011, BitTorrent promoted an open licensed version of the feature film &quot;Zenith&quot; in the United States. Users who downloaded the BitTorrent client software were also encouraged to download and share Part One of three parts of the film. On 4 May 2011, Part Two of the film was made available on VODO. The episodic release of the film, supplemented by an ARG transmedia marketing campaign, created a viral effect and over a million users downloaded the movie.

That same year, &quot;Gravity Falls&quot; creator Alex Hirsch conducted an ARG called &quot;Cipher Hunt&quot;. Hirsch started the game with the posting of an initial clue on his Twitter account, followed by the rules. It lasted from July to August 2016, and its goal was to find the clues hidden in various places around the world leading to the location of a statue of Bill Cipher. Said statue could be seen briefly after the ending credits of the series finale.

== Awards won ==

ARGs have been recognized by the mainstream entertainment world: The Ocular Effect, an ARG promoting the TV movie &quot;The Fallen&quot; and produced in the autumn of 2007 by Xenophile Media Inc. was awarded a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Achievement for an Interactive Television Program. Xenophile Media Inc.&#x27;s ReGenesis Extended Reality Game won an International Interactive Emmy Award in 2007 and in April 2008 The Truth About Marika won the iEmmy for Best Interactive TV service. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts recognizes Interactivity as a category in the British Academy Television Awards.

Likewise, Year Zero was widely heralded following its release. Such acclaim is signified in the ARG&#x27;s Grand Prix Cyber Lions award, viewed as &quot;the most prestigious of all advertising awards,&quot; at Cannes. Adweek published a quote from the selection committee on the award decision, explaining that &quot;42 Entertainment&#x27;s [viral campaign for Nine Inch Nails] impressed the jury because of its use of a variety of media, from outdoor to guerrilla to online, and how digital [media] can play a central role of a big idea campaign.&quot;

In turn, Why So Serious also won a Grand Prix Award, alongside a Webby for interactive advertising. World Without Oil was recognized for its achievements, too, earning the Activism award at the 2008 SXSW Web Awards.

Project Architeuthis, created for the U.S. Navy as a recruiting device for its cryptology division, won numerous awards, including the 2015 Warc Grand Prix for Social Strategy.

<text>The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) is an oil transportation system spanning Alaska, including the trans-Alaska crude-oil pipeline, 12 pump stations, several hundred miles of feeder pipelines, and the Valdez Marine Terminal. TAPS is one of the world&#x27;s largest pipeline systems. The core pipeline itself, which is commonly called the Alaska pipeline, trans-Alaska pipeline, or Alyeska pipeline, (or The pipeline as referred to by Alaskan residents), is an long, diameter pipeline that conveys oil from Prudhoe Bay, on Alaska&#x27;s North Slope, south to Valdez, on the shores of Prince William Sound in southcentral Alaska. The crude oil pipeline is privately owned by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company.

Oil was first discovered in Prudhoe Bay in 1968 and the 800 miles of 48&quot; steel pipe was ordered from Japan in 1969 (U.S. steel manufacturers did not have the capacity at that time). However, construction was delayed for nearly 5 years due to legal and environmental issues. The eight oil companies that owned the rights to the oil hired Bechtel for the pipeline design and construction and Fluor for the 12 pump stations and the Valdez Terminal. Preconstruction work during 1973 and 1974 was critical and included the building of camps to house workers, construction of roads and bridges where none existed, and carefully laying out the pipeline right of way to avoid difficult river crossings and animal habitats. Construction of the pipeline system took place between 1975 and 1977. It was important for the United States to have a domestic source of oil to offset the high rise in foreign oil and the Alaska Pipeline fulfilled that obligation.

Building oil pipelines in the 1950s and 60s was not difficult in the contiguous United States. However, in building the Alaska Pipeline, engineers faced a wide range of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline was one of the first large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska due to high wages, long work hours, and paid-for housing, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.

The first barrel of oil traveled through the pipeline in the summer with full-scale production by the end of the year. Several notable incidents of oil leakage have occurred since, including those caused by sabotage, maintenance failures, and bullet holes. As of 2015, it had shipped over of oil. The pipeline has been shown capable of delivering over two million barrels of oil per day but nowadays usually operates at a fraction of maximum capacity. If flow were to stop or throughput were too little, the line could freeze. The pipeline could be extended and used to transport oil produced from controversial proposed drilling projects in the nearby Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).

== Origins ==
Iñupiat people on the North Slope of Alaska had mined oil-saturated peat for possibly thousands of years, using it as fuel for heat and light. Whalers who stayed at Point Barrow saw the substance the Iñupiat called pitch and recognized it as petroleum. Charles Brower, a whaler who settled at Barrow and operated trading posts along the Arctic coast, directed geologist Alfred Hulse Brooks to oil seepages at Cape Simpson and Fish Creek in the far north of Alaska, east of the village of Barrow. Brooks&#x27; report confirmed the observations of Thomas Simpson, an officer of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company who first observed the seepages in 1836. Similar seepages were found at the Canning River in 1919 by Ernest de Koven Leffingwell. Following the First World War, as the United States Navy converted its ships from coal to fuel oil, a stable supply of oil became important to the U.S. government. Accordingly, President Warren G. Harding established by executive order a series of Naval Petroleum Reserves (NPR-1 through -4) across the United States. These reserves were areas thought to be rich in oil and set aside for future drilling by the U.S. Navy. Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4 was sited in Alaska&#x27;s far north, just south of Barrow, and encompassed .

The first explorations of NPR-4 were undertaken by the U.S. Geological Survey from 1923 to 1925 and focused on mapping, identifying and characterizing coal resources in the western portion of the reserve and petroleum exploration in the eastern and northern portions of the reserve. These surveys were primarily pedestrian in nature; no drilling or remote sensing techniques were available at the time. These surveys named many of the geographic features of the areas explored, including the Philip Smith Mountains and quadrangle.

The petroleum reserve lay dormant until World War II provided an impetus to explore new oil prospects. The first renewed efforts to identify strategic oil assets were a two pronged survey using bush aircraft, local Inupiat guides, and personnel from multiple agencies to locate reported seeps. Ebbley and Joesting reported on these initial forays in 1943. Starting in 1944, the U.S. Navy funded oil exploration near Umiat Mountain, on the Colville River in the foothills of the Brooks Range. Surveyors from the U.S. Geological Survey spread across the petroleum reserve and worked to determine its extent until 1953, when the Navy suspended funding for the project. The USGS found several oil fields, most notably the Alpine and Umiat Oil Field, but none were cost-effective to develop.

Four years after the Navy suspended its survey, Richfield Oil Corporation (later Atlantic Richfield and ARCO) drilled an enormously successful oil well near the Swanson River in southern Alaska, near Kenai. The resulting Swanson River Oil Field was Alaska&#x27;s first major commercially producing oil field, and it spurred the exploration and development of many others. By 1965, five oil and 11 natural gas fields had been developed. This success and the previous Navy exploration of its petroleum reserve led petroleum engineers to the conclusion that the area of Alaska north of the Brooks Range surely held large amounts of oil and gas. The problems came from the area&#x27;s remoteness and harsh climate. It was estimated that between and of oil would have to be recovered to make a North Slope oil field commercially viable.

In 1967, Atlantic Richfield (ARCO) began detailed survey work in the Prudhoe Bay area. By January 1968, reports began circulating that natural gas had been discovered by a discovery well. On March 12, 1968, an Atlantic Richfield drilling crew hit paydirt. A discovery well began flowing at the rate of of oil per day. On June 25, ARCO announced that a second discovery well likewise was producing oil at a similar rate. Together, the two wells confirmed the existence of the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. The new field contained more than of oil, making it the largest in North America and the 18th largest in the world.

The problem soon became how to develop the oil field and ship product to U.S. markets. Pipeline systems represent a high initial cost but lower operating costs, but no pipeline of the necessary length had yet been constructed. Several other solutions were offered. Boeing proposed a series of gigantic 12-engine tanker aircraft to transport oil from the field, the Boeing RC-1. General Dynamics proposed a line of tanker submarines for travel beneath the Arctic ice cap, and another group proposed extending the Alaska Railroad to Prudhoe Bay.

To test this, in 1969 Humble Oil and Refining Company sent a specially fitted oil tanker, the , to test the feasibility of transporting oil via ice-breaking tankers to market. The &quot;Manhattan&quot; was fitted with an ice-breaking bow, powerful engines, and hardened propellers before successfully traveling the Northwest Passage from the Atlantic Ocean to the Beaufort Sea. During the voyage, the ship suffered damage to several of its cargo holds, which flooded with seawater. Wind-blown ice forced the &quot;Manhattan&quot; to change its intended route from the M&#x27;Clure Strait to the smaller Prince of Wales Strait. It was escorted back through the Northwest Passage by a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker, the CCGS &quot;John A. Macdonald&quot;. Although the &quot;Manhattan&quot; transited the Northwest Passage again in the summer of 1970, the concept was considered too risky.

== Forming Alyeska ==
In February 1969, before the SS &quot;Manhattan&quot; had even sailed from its East Coast starting point, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an unincorporated joint group created by ARCO, British Petroleum, and Humble Oil in October 1968, asked for permission from the United States Department of the Interior to begin geological and engineering studies of a proposed oil pipeline route from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, across Alaska. Even before the first feasibility studies began, the oil companies had chosen the approximate route of the pipeline.

Because TAPS hoped to begin laying pipe by September 1969, substantial orders were placed for steel pipeline 48 inches (122 cm) in diameter. No American company manufactured pipe of that specification, so three Japanese companies—Sumitomo Metal Industries, Nippon Steel Corporation and Nippon Kokan Kabushiki Kaisha—received a $100 million contract for more than 800 miles (1280 km) of pipeline. At the same time, TAPS placed a $30 million order for the first of the enormous pumps that would be needed to push the oil through the pipeline.

In June 1969, as the SS &quot;Manhattan&quot; traveled through the Northwest Passage, TAPS formally applied to the Interior Department for a permit to build an oil pipeline across of public land—from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. The application was for a 100-foot (30.5 m) wide right of way to build a subterranean 48-inch (122-centimeter) pipeline including 11 pumping stations. Another right of way was requested to build a construction and maintenance highway paralleling the pipeline. A document of just 20 pages contained all of the information TAPS had collected about the route up to that stage in its surveying.

The Interior Department responded by sending personnel to analyze the proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert in charge of the Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of the pipeline was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route. In a report, Brewer said the hot oil conveyed by the pipeline would melt the underlying permafrost, causing the pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was passed along to the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.

Udall imposed the freeze on any projects involving land claimed by Alaska Natives in hopes that an overarching Native claims settlement would result. In the fall of 1969, the Department of the Interior and TAPS set about bypassing the land freeze by obtaining waivers from the various native villages that had claims to a portion of the proposed right of way. By the end of September, all the relevant villages had waived their right-of-way claims, and Secretary of the Interior Wally Hickel asked Congress to lift the land freeze for the entire TAPS project. After several months of questioning by the House and Senate committees with oversight of the project, Hickel was given the authority to lift the land freeze and give the go-ahead to TAPS.

TAPS began issuing letters of intent to contractors for construction of the &quot;haul road&quot;, a highway running the length of the pipeline route to be used for construction. Heavy equipment was prepared, and crews prepared to go to work after Hickel gave permission and the snow melted. Before Hickel could act, however, several Alaska Native and conservation groups asked a judge in Washington, D.C., to issue an injunction against the project. Several of the native villages that had waived claims on the right of way reneged because TAPS had not chosen any Native contractors for the project and the contractors chosen were not likely to hire Native workers.

On April 1, 1970, Judge George Luzerne Hart, Jr., of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, ordered the Interior Department to not issue a construction permit for a section of the project that crossed one of the claims. Less than two weeks later, Hart heard arguments from conservation groups that the TAPS project violated the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which had gone into effect at the start of the year. Hart issued an injunction against the project, preventing the Interior Department from issuing a construction permit and halting the project in its tracks.

After the Department of the Interior was stopped from issuing a construction permit, the unincorporated TAPS consortium was reorganized into the new incorporated Alyeska Pipeline Service Company. Former Humble Oil manager Edward L. Patton was put in charge of the new company and began to lobby strongly in favor of an Alaska Native claims settlement to resolve the disputes over the pipeline right of way.

Opposition to construction of the pipeline primarily came from two sources: Alaska Native groups and conservationists. Alaska Natives were upset that the pipeline would cross the land traditionally claimed by a variety of native groups, but no economic benefits would accrue to them directly. Conservationists were angry at what they saw as an incursion into America&#x27;s last wilderness.

===Conservation objections===

Although conservation groups and environmental organizations had voiced opposition to the pipeline project before 1970, the introduction of the National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.

The injunction against the project forced Alyeska to do further research throughout the summer of 1970. The collected material was turned over to the Interior Department in October 1970, and a draft environmental impact statement was published in January 1971. The 294-page statement drew massive criticism, generating more than 12,000 pages of testimony and evidence in Congressional debates by the end of March. Criticisms of the project included its effect on the Alaska tundra, possible pollution, harm to animals, geographic features, and the lack of much engineering information from Alyeska. One element of opposition the report quelled was the discussion of alternatives. All the proposed alternatives—extension of the Alaska Railroad, an alternative route through Canada, establishing a port at Prudhoe Bay, and more—were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across Alaska.

Opposition also was directed at the building of the construction and maintenance highway parallel to the pipeline. Although a clause in Alyeska&#x27;s pipeline proposal called for removal of the pipeline at a certain point, no such provision was made for removal of the road. Sydney Howe, president of the Conservation Foundation, warned: &quot;The oil might last for fifty years. A road would remain forever.&quot; This argument relied upon the slow growth of plants and animals in far northern Alaska due to the harsh conditions and short growing season. In testimony, an environmentalist argued that arctic trees, though only a few feet tall, had been seedlings &quot;when George Washington was inaugurated&quot;.

The portion of the environmental debate with the biggest symbolic impact took place when discussing the pipeline&#x27;s impact on caribou herds. Environmentalists proposed that the pipeline would have an effect on caribou similar to the effect of the U.S. transcontinental railroad on the American bison population of North America. Pipeline critics said the pipeline would block traditional migration routes, making caribou populations smaller and making them easier to hunt. This idea was exploited in anti-pipeline advertising, most notably when a picture of a forklift carrying several legally shot caribou was emblazoned with the slogan, &quot;There is more than one way to get caribou across the Alaska Pipeline&quot;. The use of caribou as an example of the pipeline&#x27;s environmental effects reached a peak in the spring of 1971, when the draft environmental statement was being debated.

=== Native objections ===
In 1902, the United States Department of Agriculture set aside of Southeast Alaska as the Tongass National Forest. Tlingit natives who lived in the area protested that the land was theirs and had been unfairly taken. In 1935, Congress passed a law allowing the Tlingits to sue for recompense, and the resulting case dragged on until 1968, when a $7.5 million settlement was reached. Following the Native lawsuit to halt work on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, this precedent was frequently mentioned in debate, causing pressure to resolve the situation more quickly than the 33 years it had taken for the Tlingits to be satisfied. Between 1968 and 1971, a succession of bills were introduced into the U.S. Congress to compensate statewide Native claims. The earliest bill offered $7 million, but this was flatly rejected.

The Alaska Federation of Natives, which had been created in 1966, hired former United States Supreme Court justice Arthur Goldberg, who suggested that a settlement should include of land and a payment of $500 million. The issue remained at a standstill until Alyeska began lobbying in favor of a Native claims act in Congress in order to lift the legal injunction against pipeline construction. In October 1971, President Richard Nixon signed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). Under the act, Native groups would renounce their land claims in exchange for $962.5 million and in federal land. The money and land were split up among village and regional corporations, which then distributed shares of stock to Natives in the region or village. The shares paid dividends based on both the settlement and corporation profits. To pipeline developers, the most important aspect of ANCSA was the clause dictating that no Native allotments could be selected in the path of the pipeline.

Another objection of the natives was the potential for the pipeline to disrupt a traditional way of life. Many natives were worried that the disruption caused by the pipeline would scare away the whales and caribou that are relied upon for food.

== Legal issues and politics ==

In both the courts and Congress, Alyeska and the oil companies fought for the pipeline&#x27;s construction amidst opposition concerning the pipeline&#x27;s EIS (environmental impact statement). The arguments continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most of which had been erased 70 years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska&#x27;s preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and shutoff, and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.

All the arguments both for and against the pipeline were incorporated into the 3,500-page, 9-volume final environmental impact statement, which was released on March 20, 1972. Although Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens felt the statement &quot;was not written by a proponent,&quot; it maintained the general approval for pipeline construction that was demonstrated in the draft statement. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton allowed 45 days of comment after the release, and conservationists created a 1,300-page document opposing the impact statement. This document failed to sway Judge Hart, who lifted the injunction on the project on August 15, 1972.

The environmental groups that had filed the injunction appealed the decision, and on October 6, 1972, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., partially reversed Hart&#x27;s decision. The appeals court said that although the impact statement followed the guidelines set by the National Environmental Policy Act, it did not follow the Minerals Leasing Act, which allowed for a smaller pipeline right of way than was required for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil companies and Alyeska appealed this decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in April 1973, the court declined to hear the case.

=== Congressional issues ===
With the appeals court having decided that the Minerals Leasing Act did not cover the pipeline&#x27;s requirements, Alyeska and the oil companies began lobbying Congress to either amend the act or create a new law that would permit a larger right-of-way. The Senate Interior Committee began the first hearings on a series of bills to that effect on March 9, 1973. Environmental opposition switched from contesting the pipeline on NEPA grounds to fighting an amendment to the leasing act or a new bill. By the spring and summer of 1973, these opposition groups attempted to persuade Congress to endorse a Trans-Canada oil pipeline or a railroad. They believed the &quot;leave it in the ground&quot; argument was doomed to fail, and the best way to oppose the pipeline would be to propose an ineffective alternative which could be easily defeated. The problem with this approach was that any such alternative would cover more ground and be more damaging environmentally than the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.

Hearings in both the U.S. Senate and the House continued through the summer of 1973 on both new bills and amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act. On July 13, an amendment calling for more study of the project—the Mondale-Bayh Amendment—was defeated. This was followed by another victory for pipeline proponents when an amendment by Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel was passed by the Senate. The amendment declared that the pipeline project fulfilled all aspects of NEPA and modified the Mineral Leasing Act to allow the larger right-of-way for the Alaska pipeline. Upon reconsideration, the vote was tied at 49–49 and required the vote of vice president Spiro Agnew, who supported the amendment; a similar amendment was passed in the House on August 2.

=== Oil crisis and authorization act ===
On October 17, 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries announced an oil embargo against the United States in retaliation for its support of Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Because the United States imported approximately 35 percent of its oil from foreign sources, the embargo had a major effect. The price of gasoline shot upward, gasoline shortages were common, and rationing was considered. Most Americans began demanding a solution to the problem, and President Richard Nixon began lobbying for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline as at least a part of the answer.

Nixon supported the pipeline project even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority for the remainder of the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial incentives, and granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.

== Construction ==

Although the legal right-of-way was cleared by January 1974, cold weather, the need to hire workers, and construction of the Dalton Highway meant work on the pipeline itself did not begin until March. Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, tens of thousands of people worked on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came to Alaska, attracted by the prospect of high-paying jobs at a time when most of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.

Construction workers endured long hours, cold temperatures, and brutal conditions. Difficult terrain, particularly in Atigun Pass, Keystone Canyon, and near the Sagavanirktok River forced workers to come up with solutions for unforeseen problems. Faulty welds and accusations of poor quality control caused a Congressional investigation that ultimately revealed little. More than $8 billion was spent to build the of pipeline, the Valdez Marine Terminal, and 12 pump stations. The construction effort also had a human toll. Thirty-two Alyeska and contract employees died from causes directly related to construction. That figure does not include common carrier casualties.

== Impact ==

=== Boomtowns ===
Construction of the pipeline caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down the pipeline route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town&#x27;s residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.

This increase in population caused many adverse effects. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. In Valdez, lots of land that sold for $400 in the late 1960s went for $4,000 in 1973, $8,000 in 1974, and $10,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home in Fairbanks housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week. In Valdez, an apartment that rented for $286 per month in December 1974 cost $520 per month in March 1975 and $1,600 per month—plus two mandatory roommates—in April 1975. Hotel rooms were sold out as far away as Glenallen, north of Valdez.

The skyrocketing prices were driven by the high salaries paid to pipeline workers, who were eager to spend their money. The high salaries caused a corresponding demand for higher wages among non-pipeline workers in Alaska. Non-pipeline businesses often could not keep up with the demand for higher wages, and job turnover was high. Yellow cab in Fairbanks had a turnover rate of 800 percent; a nearby restaurant had a turnover rate of more than 1,000 percent. Many positions were filled by high school students promoted above their experience level. To meet the demand, a Fairbanks high school ran in two shifts: one in the morning and the other in the afternoon in order to teach students who also worked eight hours per day. More wages and more people meant higher demand for goods and services. Waiting in line became a fact of life in Fairbanks, and the Fairbanks McDonald&#x27;s became No. 2 in the world for sales—behind only the recently opened Stockholm store. Alyeska and its contractors bought in bulk from local stores, causing shortages of everything from cars to tractor parts, water softener salt, batteries and ladders.

The large sums of money being made and spent caused an upsurge in crime and illicit activity in towns along the pipeline route. This was exacerbated by the fact that police officers and state troopers resigned in large groups to become pipeline security guards at wages far in excess of those available in public-sector jobs. Fairbanks&#x27; Second Avenue became a notorious hangout for prostitutes, and dozens of bars operated throughout town. In 1975, the Fairbanks Police Department estimated between 40 and 175 prostitutes were working in the city of 15,000 people. Trouble was incited sometimes by prostitutes&#x27; pimps, who engaged in . In 1976, police responded to a shootout between warring pimps who wielded automatic firearms. By and large, however, the biggest police issue was the number of drunken brawls and fighting. On the pipeline itself, thievery was a major problem. Poor accounting and record keeping allowed large numbers of tools and large amounts of equipment to be stolen. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported in 1975 that as many as 200 of Alyeska&#x27;s 1,200 yellow-painted trucks were missing from Alaska and &quot;scattered from Miami to Mexico City&quot;. Alyeska denied the problem and said only 20–30 trucks were missing. The theft problem was typified by pipeliners&#x27; practice of mailing empty boxes to pipeline camps. The boxes then would be filled with items and shipped out. After Alyeska ruled that all packages had to be sealed in the presence of a security guard, the number of packages being sent from camps dropped by 75 percent.

=== Economy of Alaska ===

Since the completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in 1977, the government of the state of Alaska has been reliant on taxes paid by oil producers and shippers. Prior to 1976, Alaska&#x27;s personal income tax rate was 14.5 percent—the highest in the United States. The gross state product was $8 billion, and Alaskans earned $5 billion in personal income. Thirty years after the pipeline began operating, the state had no personal income tax, the gross state product was $39 billion, and Alaskans earned $25 billion in personal income. Alaska moved from the most heavily taxed state to the most tax-free state.

The difference was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the taxes and revenue it brought to Alaska. Alyeska and the oil companies injected billions of dollars into the Alaska economy during the construction effort and the years afterward. In addition, the taxes paid by those companies altered the tax structure of the state. By 1982, five years after the pipeline started transporting oil, 86.5 percent of Alaska revenue came directly from the petroleum industry.

The series of taxes levied on oil production in Alaska has changed several times since 1977, but the overall form remains mostly the same. Alaska receives royalties from oil production on state land. The state also has a property tax on oil production structures and transportation (pipeline) property—the only state property tax in Alaska. There is a special corporate income tax on petroleum companies, and the state taxes the amount of petroleum produced. This production tax is levied on the cost of oil at Pump Station 1. To calculate this tax, the state takes the market value of the oil, subtracts transportation costs (tanker and pipeline tariffs), subtracts production costs, then multiplies the resulting amount per barrel of oil produced each month. The state then takes a percentage of the dollar figure produced.

Under the latest taxation system, introduced by former governor Sarah Palin in 2007 and passed by the Alaska Legislature that year, the maximum tax rate on profits is 50 percent. The rate fluctuates based on the cost of oil, with lower prices incurring lower tax rates. The state also claims 12.5 percent of all oil produced in the state. This &quot;royalty oil&quot; is not taxed but is sold back to the oil companies, generating additional revenue. At a local level, the pipeline owners pay property taxes on the portions of the pipeline and the pipeline facilities that lay within districts that impose a property tax. This property tax is based on the pipeline&#x27;s value (as assessed by the state) and the local property tax rate. In the Fairbanks North Star Borough, for example, pipeline owners paid $9.2 million in property taxes—approximately 10 percent of all property taxes paid in the borough.

The enormous amount of public revenue created by the pipeline provoked debates about what to do with the windfall. The record $900 million created by the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale took place at a time when the entire state budget was less than $118 million, yet the entire amount created by the sale was used up by 1975. Taxes on the pipeline and oil carried by it promised to bring even more money into state coffers. To ensure that oil revenue wasn&#x27;t spent as it came in, the Alaska Legislature and governor Jay Hammond proposed the creation of an Alaska Permanent Fund—a long-term savings account for the state. This measure required a constitutional amendment, which was duly passed in November 1976. The amendment requires at least 25 percent of mineral extraction revenue to be deposited in the Permanent Fund. On February 28, 1977, the first deposit—$734,000—was put into the Permanent Fund. That deposit and subsequent ones were invested entirely in bonds, but debates quickly arose about the style of investments and what they should be used for.

In 1980, the Alaska Legislature created the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation to manage the investments of the Permanent Fund, and it passed the Permanent Fund Dividend program, which provided for annual payments to Alaskans from the interest earned by the fund. After two years of legal arguments about who should be eligible for payments, the first checks were distributed to Alaskans. After peaking at more than $40 billion in 2007, the fund&#x27;s value declined to approximately $26 billion as of summer 2009. In addition to the Permanent Fund, the state also maintains the Constitutional Budget Reserve, a separate savings account established in 1990 after a legal dispute over pipeline tariffs generated a one-time payment of more than $1.5 billion from the oil companies. The Constitutional Budget reserve is run similar to the Permanent Fund, but money from it can be withdrawn to pay for the state&#x27;s annual budget, unlike the Permanent Fund.

=== Oil prices ===

Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did not have a major immediate impact on global oil prices. This is partly because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS&#x27;s share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.

=== Social impact ===
The pipeline attracts tens of thousands of visitors annually on pipeline tourism trips. Notable visitors have included Henry Kissinger, Jamie Farr, John Denver, President Gerald Ford, King Olav V of Norway, and Gladys Knight. Knight starred in one of two movies about the pipeline construction, &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; and &quot;Joyride&quot;, both were critically panned. Other films, such as &quot;On Deadly Ground&quot; and &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;, refer to the pipeline or use it as a plot device.

The Alistair Maclean novel, &quot;Athabasca&quot;, published 1980, also deals with a sabotage threat against both the Alaska Pipeline and the Athabasca tar sands in Canada.

The pipeline has also inspired various forms of artwork. The most notable form of art unique to the pipeline are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe cut into the shape of Alaska with a piece of metal delineating the path of the pipeline through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the pipeline.

== Technical details ==

Oil going into the Trans-Alaska Pipeline comes from one of several oil fields on Alaska&#x27;s North Slope. The Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, the one most commonly associated with the pipeline, contributes oil, as do the Kuparuk, Alpine, Endicott, and Liberty oil fields, among others. Oil emerges from the ground at approximately and cools to by the time it reaches Pump Station 1 through feeder pipelines that stretch across the North Slope. North Slope crude oil has a specific gravity of 29.9 API at . Pipeline flow rate has been steady from 2013 to 2018, hovering just over half a million barrels per day. The minimum flow year was 2015 which averaged , which is less than its theoretical maximum capacity of or its actual maximum of in 1988. From Pump Station 1, the average time taken by the oil to travel the entire length of the pipeline to Valdez has increased from 4.5 days to 18 days from 1988 to 2018.

The minimum flow through the pipeline is not as clearly defined as its maximum. Operating at lower flows will extend the life of the pipeline as well as increasing profit for its owners. The 2012 flow of 600,000 bbl/d is significantly less than what the pipeline was designed for. Low flowrates require that the oil move slower through the line, meaning that its temperature drops more than in high-flow situations. A freeze in the line would block a pig in the line, which would force a shutdown and repairs. A 2011 engineering report by Alyeska stated that, to avoid freezing, heaters would need to be installed at several pump stations. This report noted that these improvements could bring flow as low as 350,000 bbl/d, but it did not attempt to determine the absolute minimum. Other studies have suggested that the minimum is 70,000 to 100,000 bbl/d with the current pipeline. Alyeska could also replace the 48&quot; pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Fairbanks with a 20&quot; pipeline and use rail the rest of the way, which would allow as little as 45,000 bbl/d.

Pumping stations maintain the momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length of the pipeline. The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 L/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 L/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.

Because of meanders and thermal and seismic accommodations, the amount of welded steel pipeline between the pipe stations and the end of the line is , while the linear distance between the Prudhoe Bay and Valdez station endpoints is . The pipeline crosses 34 major streams or rivers and nearly 500 minor ones. Its highest point is at Atigun Pass, where the pipeline is above sea level. The maximum grade of the pipeline is 145%, at Thompson Pass in the Chugach Mountains. The pipeline was created in 40 and 60-foot (12.2 and 18.3-meter) sections. Forty-two thousand of these sections were welded together to make a double joint, which was laid in place on the line. Sixty-six thousand &quot;field girth welds&quot; were needed to join the double joints into a continuous pipeline. The pipe is of two different thicknesses: of it is thick, while the remaining is thick. More than 78,000 vertical support members hold up the aboveground sections of pipeline, and the pipeline contains 178 valves.

At the end of the pipeline is the Valdez Marine Terminal, which can store of oil across eighteen storage tanks. They are tall and in diameter. They average 85% full at any given time—. Three power plants at the terminal generate 12.5 megawatts each. Four tanker berths are available for mooring ships in addition to two loading berths, where oil pumping takes place. More than 19,000 tankers have been filled by the marine terminal since 1977.

== Maintenance ==

The pipeline is surveyed several times per day, mostly by air. Foot and road patrols also take place to check for problems such as leaks or pipe settling or shifting. The pipeline can be surveyed in as little as twenty one days, but most surveys take longer to ensure thoroughness. These external inspections are only part of standard maintenance, however. The majority of pipeline maintenance is done by pipeline pigs—mechanical devices sent through the pipeline to perform a variety of functions.

The most common pig is the scraper pig, which removes wax that precipitates out of the oil and collects on the walls of the pipeline. The colder the oil, the more wax buildup. This buildup can cause a variety of problems, so regular &quot;piggings&quot; are needed to keep the pipe clear. A second type of pig travels through the pipe and looks for corrosion. Corrosion-detecting pigs use either magnetic or ultrasonic sensors. Magnetic sensors detect corrosion by analyzing variations in the magnetic field of the pipeline&#x27;s metal. Ultrasonic testing pigs detect corrosion by examining vibrations in the walls of the pipeline. Other types of pigs look for irregularities in the shape of the pipeline, such as if it is bending or buckling. &quot;Smart&quot; pigs, which contain a variety of sensors, can perform multiple tasks. Typically, these pigs are inserted at Prudhoe Bay and travel the length of the pipeline. In July 2009, a pig launcher was installed at Pump Station 8, near the midpoint of the pipeline.

A third type of common maintenance is the installation and replacement of sacrificial anodes along the subterranean portions of pipeline. These anodes reduce the corrosion caused by electrochemical action that affect these interred sections of pipeline. Excavation and replacement of the anodes is required as they corrode.

== Incidents ==


The pipeline has at times been damaged due to sabotage, human error, maintenance failures, and natural disasters. By law, Alyeska is required to report significant oil spills to regulatory authorities. The &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill is the best-known accident involving Alaska oil, but it did not involve the pipeline itself. Following the spill, Alyeska created a rapid response force that is paid for by the oil companies, including ExxonMobil, which was found liable for the spill.

An explosion on July 8, 1977, Pump Station No. 8, killed one worker, injured five others, and destroyed a pump station. A Congressional committee later announced the cause was workers not following the proper procedures, causing crude oil to flow into a pump under repair at the time. In its first two months of operation, from June 20 to August 15, 1977, seven incidents and accidents caused the pipeline to be shut down periodically. The NTSB investigated the system, and made recommendations.

The largest oil spill involving the main pipeline took place on February 15, 1978, when an unknown individual blew a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) hole in it at Steele Creek, just east of Fairbanks. Approximately of oil leaked out of the hole before the pipeline was shut down. After more than 21 hours, it was restarted.

The steel pipe is resistant to gunshots and has resisted them on several occasions, but on October 4, 2001, a drunken gunman named Daniel Carson Lewis shot a hole into a weld near Livengood, causing the second-largest mainline oil spill in pipeline history. Approximately leaked from the pipeline; were recovered and reinjected into the pipeline. Nearly of tundra were soiled and were removed in the cleanup. The pipeline was repaired and was restarted more than 60 hours later. Lewis was found guilty in December 2002 of criminal mischief, assault, drunken driving, oil pollution, and misconduct.

The pipeline was built to withstand earthquakes, forest fires, and other natural disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake occurred along a fault line that passed directly underneath the pipeline. The slider supports in that particular 1,900-foot section of the pipeline, right over the fault line, were designed to accommodate the ground slipping 20 feet horizontally and 5 vertically. In this 7.9 magnitude earthquake, the ground shifted 14 feet horizontally and 2.5 vertically. The pipeline did not break, but some slider supports were damaged, and the pipeline shut down for more than 66 hours as a precaution. In 2004, wildfires overran portions of the pipeline, but it was not damaged and did not shut down.

In May 2010, as much as several thousands of barrels were spilled from a pump station near Fort Greely during a scheduled shutdown. A relief valve control circuit failed during a test of the fire control system, and oil poured into a tank and overflowed onto a secondary containment area.

A leak was discovered on January 8, 2011, in the basement of the booster pump at Pump Station 1. For more than 80 hours, pipeline flow was reduced to 5 percent of normal. An oil collection system was put in place, and full flow resumed until the pipeline was again shut down while a bypass was installed to avoid the leaking section.

Heavy rains in Alaska have brought flooding uncomfortably close to the pipeline in recent years. In May 2019, the Dietrich River flooded north of Coldfoot, eroding 25–50 feet of riverbank, necessitating emergency work that left only an 80-foot buffer between the river and the pipeline. A few months later, in August, the Sagavanirktok River flooded, eroding 100 feet of river bank, and leaving only a 30-foot buffer between the river and the pipeline. The Lowe River also flooded near the pipeline in March 2019, and again in June 2020. Although Alyeska appears to be responding by stockpiling construction and emergency response materials, and has installed ground chillers beneath a stretch of pipeline 57 miles northwest of Fairbanks, comprehensive information on plans for addressing pipeline breaks in &quot;high consequence areas&quot; is not readily available.

In 2021, the pipeline was damaged due to thawing permafrost for the first time. Permafrost, which is ground that has been frozen for more than two years, is essential to the integrity of the pipeline. About 57 miles northwest of Fairbanks, thawing permafrost caused slope creep, which in turn caused the supports of the pipeline to twist and bend. Alyeska Corporation had to petition the Alaska Department of Natural Resources to conduct emergency defensive work to keep the permafrost stable.

== 21st century==

The original design for the pipeline in the early 1970s called for a 25-year useful life with an expected 10 billion barrels of Prudhoe Bay oil production. By most economic, engineering and construction measures, the Alaska Pipeline has been a huge success. However, since the early 2000s, declines in oil production have posed a serious problem for the pipeline. As the flow rate slows, oil spends longer in the pipeline, which allows it to cool much further while travelling to Valdez. It cannot be allowed to fall below freezing (32 °F), otherwise the pipeline could seize up, crack, and rupture, as the water content would separate from the oil and freeze in place. A &quot;Low Flow Impact Study&quot; conducted by the pipeline operators, Alyeska, concluded in June 2011 that the minimum flow for the pipeline as it currently existed was 300,000 to 350,000 barrels per day in the winter.

This minimum flow rate is a legally contentious figure, since the taxable value of the pipeline is largely dependent on how long it can be operated. In late 2011, the Alaska Superior Court ruled that Alyeska&#x27;s low flow study was invalid, and it ruled in favor of an internal BP study. The BP study concluded that with the installation of heaters along the pipeline route, the minimum flow could be lowered to . This court ruling increased ninefold the taxed property value of the pipeline. A study by the National Resources Defense Council that was also cited in this court case put specific numbers to this suggestion, and concluded that an investment of $0.8 billion in shoring up the pipeline could extend its lifespan long enough to extract an additional $28 billion of oil from existing wells alone. This NRDC study additionally explained: &quot;This is a lower minimum throughput level than what is implied in Alyeska’s Low Flow Impact Study (LoFIS). We did not use the minimum throughput level implied by LoFIS because we have serious reservations about the assumptions used in the study and the LoFIS does not provide adequate data to support its claims.&quot;

The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Renewal Environmental Impact Statement estimated in 2010 that flow levels would be workable through at least 2032 due to ongoing exploration outside ANWR. Improvements that allow low flow-rates could extend its lifespan as far as 2075.

As the pipeline&#x27;s flow has diminished, its ownership has fluctuated. In 2000, as Exxon and Mobil merged, Mobil sold its 3.1% stake in the pipeline to Williams Companies as a condition of the merger. Three years later, Williams sold that share to Koch Alaska Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of Koch Industries. Nine years later, Koch announced it would sell its share to the other pipeline owners, as did Unocal, which had held a small ownership share since 1970. In 2019, BP announced plans to sell its Alaska operations to Hilcorp Energy Company. The deal, which closed in 2020, included BP&#x27;s 49.1% ownership share of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. Opponents of the deal expressed concerns that Hillcorp, which did not fully disclose its finances, will lack the resources and expertise needed to address flooding and thawing-related safety concerns resulting from climate change.

By the terms of its land grants and leases, the owners of the Alaska Pipeline will be required to remove the pipeline and supporting equipment at the end of its life, except for cleaned and capped underground pipes. This multi-billion-dollar project is required to be paid for out of funds specifically charged to oil transport customers for this purpose, though as of 2004 these funds were co-mingled with other money and the amount needed was in dispute.

<doc id="197736" wikidata="Q104183" url="?curid=197736" title="Lillian Gish">
<text>Lillian Diana Gish (October 14, 1893 – February 27, 1993) was an American actress. Her film-acting career spanned 75 years, from 1912, in silent film shorts, to 1987. Gish was dubbed the &quot;First Lady of the Screen&quot; by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1927 and is credited with pioneering fundamental film performance techniques. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Gish as the 17th-greatest female movie star of classical Hollywood cinema.

Having acted on stage with her sister as a child, Gish was a prominent film star from 1912 into the 1920s, being particularly associated with the films of director D. W. Griffith. This included her leading role in the highest-grossing film of the silent era, Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915). Her other major films and performances from the silent era included &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (1919), &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920), &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; (1921), &quot;La Bohème&quot; (1926), and &quot;The Wind&quot; (1928).

At the dawn of the sound era, she returned to the stage and appeared in film occasionally, with leading roles in the Western &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946) and the thriller &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;. Gish also had major supporting roles in &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948), &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), and &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; (1986).

She also did considerable television work from the early 1950s into the 1980s, and retired after playing opposite Bette Davis and Vincent Price in the 1987 film &quot;The Whales of August&quot;. During her later years, Gish became a dedicated advocate for the appreciation and preservation of silent film. Despite being better known for her film work, she was also accomplished on stage, and was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1972. In 1971, she was awarded an Academy Honorary Award for her career achievements. She was awarded a Kennedy Center Honor for her contribution to American culture through performing arts in 1982.

==Early life==

Lillian Diana Gish was born on October 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio, the first child of actress Mary Robinson McConnell, and James Leigh Gish. Lillian had a younger sister, Dorothy, who also became a popular movie star.

Her mother was a Scottish Episcopalian and her father was of German Lutheran descent. The first several generations of Gishes were Dunkard ministers. Gish&#x27;s father was an alcoholic and left the family; her mother took up acting to support them. The family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, where they lived for several years with Lillian&#x27;s aunt and uncle, Henry and Rose McConnell. Their mother opened the Majestic Candy Kitchen, and the girls helped sell popcorn and candy to patrons of the old Majestic Theater, located next door. The girls attended St. Henry&#x27;s School, where they acted in school plays.

In 1910, the girls were living with their aunt Emily in Massillon, Ohio, when they were notified that their father, James, was gravely ill in Oklahoma. The 17-year-old Lillian traveled to Shawnee, Oklahoma, where James&#x27;s brother Alfred Grant Gish and his wife, Maude, lived. Her father, who by then was institutionalized in the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane in Norman, was able to travel the 35 miles to Shawnee and the two got reacquainted. She stayed with her aunt and uncle, and attended Shawnee High School there. Her father died in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1912, but she had returned to Ohio a few months before this.

When the theater next to the candy store burned down, the family moved to New York, where the girls became good friends with a next-door neighbor, Gladys Smith. Gladys was a child actress who did some work for director D. W. Griffith, and later took the stage name Mary Pickford. When Lillian and Dorothy were old enough, they joined the theatre, often traveling separately in different productions. They also took modeling jobs, with Lillian posing for artist Victor Maurel in exchange for voice lessons.

In 1912, their friend Mary Pickford introduced the sisters to Griffith and helped get them contracts with Biograph Studios. Lillian Gish soon became one of America&#x27;s best-loved actresses; she was 19 years old at the time, but told casting directors she was 16.

==Career==

===Early career===

Gish made her stage debut in 1902, at the Little Red School House in Risingsun, Ohio. From 1903 to 1904, she toured in &quot;Her First False Step&quot;, with her mother and Dorothy. In the following year, she danced with a Sarah Bernhardt production in New York City.

===Film stardom at Biograph Studios (1912–1925)===

After 10 years of acting on the stage, she made her film debut opposite Dorothy in Griffith&#x27;s short film &quot;An Unseen Enemy&quot; (1912). At the time, established thespians considered &quot;the flickers&quot; a rather base form of entertainment, but she was assured of its merits. Gish continued to perform on the stage, and in 1913, during a run of &quot;A Good Little Devil&quot;, she collapsed from anemia. Lillian took suffering for her art to the extreme in a film career which became her obsession. One of the enduring images of Gish&#x27;s silent film years is the climax of the melodramatic &quot;Way Down East&quot;, in which Gish&#x27;s character floats unconscious on an ice floe toward a raging waterfall, her long hair and hand trailing in the water. Her performance in these frigid conditions gave her lasting nerve damage in several fingers. Similarly, when preparing for her death scene in &quot;La Bohème&quot; over a decade later, Gish reportedly did not eat and drink for three days beforehand, causing the director to fear he would be filming the death of his star, as well as of the character.

Lillian starred in many of Griffith&#x27;s most acclaimed films, including &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; (1919), &quot;Way Down East&quot; (1920), and &quot;Orphans of the Storm&quot; (1921). He utilized her expressive talents to the fullest, developing her into a suffering yet strong heroine. Having appeared in more than 25 short films and features in her first two years as a movie actress, Lillian became a major star, becoming known as the &quot;First Lady of the Screen&quot; and appearing in lavish productions, frequently of literary works such as &quot;Way Down East&quot;. She became the most esteemed actress of budding Hollywood cinema.

She directed her sister Dorothy in one film, &quot;Remodeling Her Husband&quot; (1920), when D. W. Griffith took his unit on location. He told Gish that he thought the crew would work harder for a girl. Gish never directed again, telling reporters at the time that directing was a man&#x27;s job. The film is now thought to be lost.

===Work with MGM (1925–1928)===
Gish reluctantly ended her work with Griffith in 1925 to take an offer from the recently formed MGM, which gave her more creative control. MGM offered her a contract in 1926 for six films, for which she was offered $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ). She turned down the money, requesting a more modest wage and a percentage, so the studio could use the funds to increase the quality of her films—hiring the best actors, screenwriters, etc. By the late silent era, Greta Garbo had surpassed her as MGM&#x27;s leading lady, and Gish&#x27;s contract with MGM ended in 1928. Three films with MGM gave her near-total creative control: &quot;La Bohème&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; (both 1926), and &quot;The Wind&quot; (1928). &quot;The Wind&quot;, directed by Victor Sjöström, was Gish&#x27;s favorite film of her MGM career. A commercial failure with the rise of talkies, it is now recognized as one of the most distinguished works of the silent period. Gish biographer Edward Wagenknecht wrote:
===Sound debut, return to the stage, and television and radio===

Her debut in talkies was only moderately successful, largely due to the public&#x27;s changing attitudes. Many of the silent era&#x27;s leading ladies, such as Gish and Pickford, had been wholesome and innocent, but by the early 1930s (after the full adoption of sound and before the Motion Picture Production Code was enforced), these roles were perceived as outdated. The &quot;ingénue&quot;″s diametric opposite, the vamp, was at the height of its popularity and Gish was increasingly seen as a &quot;silly, sexless antique&quot; (to quote fellow actress Louise Brooks&#x27;s sarcastic summary of those who criticized Gish). Gish did not want to act on screen and returned to her first love, the theater. She acted on the stage for the most part in the 1930s and early 1940s, appearing in roles as varied as Ophelia in Guthrie McClintic&#x27;s landmark 1936 production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (with John Gielgud and Judith Anderson) and Marguerite in a limited run of &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot;. Of the former, she said, with pride, &quot;I played a &quot;lewd&quot; Ophelia!&quot;

Returning to movies, Gish was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1946 for &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;. The scenes of her character&#x27;s illness and death late in that film seemed intended to evoke the memory of some of her silent-film performances. She appeared in films from time to time for the rest of her life, notably in &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot; (1955) as a rural guardian angel protecting her charges from a murderous preacher played by Robert Mitchum. She was considered for various roles in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; ranging from Ellen O&#x27;Hara, Scarlett&#x27;s mother (which went to Barbara O&#x27;Neil), to prostitute Belle Watling (which went to Ona Munson).

Gish&#x27;s television debut occurred on February 6, 1949, when she portrayed Abby, a housemaid, in &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; on NBC. A review in the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; described her work as &quot;an excellent portrayal&quot;. She made numerous television appearances from the early 1950s into the late 1980s. Her most acclaimed television work was starring in the original production of &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; in 1953. She appeared as Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in the short-lived 1965 Broadway musical &quot;Anya&quot;. In addition to her later acting appearances, Gish became one of the leading advocates of the lost art of the silent film, often giving speeches and touring to screenings of classic works. In 1975, she hosted &quot;The Silent Years&quot;, a PBS film program of silent films. She was interviewed in the television documentary series &quot;Hollywood: A Celebration of the American Silent Film&quot; (1980).
Gish received a Special Academy Award in 1971 &quot;for superlative artistry and for distinguished contribution to the progress of motion pictures&quot;. In 1979, she was awarded the Women in film Crystal Award in Los Angeles. In 1984, she received an American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award, becoming only the second female recipient (preceded by Bette Davis in 1977) and the only recipient who was a major figure in the silent era. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1720 Vine Street.

Her last film role was appearing in &quot;The Whales of August&quot; in 1987 at the age of 93, with Vincent Price, Bette Davis, and Ann Sothern, in which Gish and Davis starred as elderly sisters in Maine. Gish&#x27;s performance was received glowingly, winning her the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress. At the Cannes festival, Gish won a 10-minute standing ovation from the audience. Some in the entertainment industry were angry that Gish did not receive an Oscar nomination for her role in &quot;The Whales of August&quot;. Gish was more complacent, only remarking, &quot;Well, now I won&#x27;t have to go and lose to Cher&quot;.

Her final professional appearance was a cameo on the 1988 studio recording of Jerome Kern&#x27;s &quot;Show Boat&quot;, starring Frederica von Stade and Jerry Hadley, in which she affectingly spoke the few lines of &quot;The Old Lady on the Levee&quot; in the final scene. The last words of her long career were: &quot;Good night&quot;.

===Radio===
Gish starred in an episode of the popular CBS Radio series &quot;Suspense&quot;. The episode &quot;Marry for Murder&quot; was broadcast on September 9, 1943. In 1944, Gish starred in an episode of &quot;I Was There&quot;, broadcast on CBS. The episode dramatized the making of the film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. On May 31, 1951, she starred in an adaptation of &quot;Black Chiffon&quot; on &quot;Playhouse on Broadway&quot;.

==Honors==
The American Film Institute named Gish 17th among the greatest female stars of classic American cinema. In 1955, she was awarded the George Eastman Award, for distinguished contribution to the art of film, at the George Eastman Museum&#x27;s (then George Eastman House&#x27;s) inaugural Festival of Film Artists. She was awarded an Academy Honorary Award in 1971, and in 1984 she received an AFI Life Achievement Award. Gish was also awarded Kennedy Center Honors in 1982.

In 1979, she introduced &quot;The Wind&quot; at a screening at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles. She was a special guest at the Telluride Film Festival in 1983.

=== Bowling Green State University ===
The Gish Film Theatre and Gallery of Bowling Green State University&#x27;s Department of Theatre and Film was named for Lillian and Dorothy Gish. Gish was in attendance at the dedication on June 11, 1976; she accepted the honor for herself and her sister, who had died several years earlier. The university awarded Gish the honorary degree of doctor of performing arts the next day. In 1982, the University accepted a collection of Gish films and photographs that had previously been displayed at the Museum of Modern Art. It solicited donations from Gish friends and associates to renovate the Gish Theatre and create an endowment in the 1990s. Following Gish&#x27;s 1993 death, the university raised funds to enlarge its gallery to display memorabilia received from Gish&#x27;s estate.

In February 2019, the university&#x27;s Black Student Union called for the renaming of the Gish Theatre due to Gish&#x27;s involvement with the controversial &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. In April 2019, a task force recommended removing the Gish name; the trustees unanimously voted to remove the name on May 3, 2019.

Mike Kaplan, co-producer of &quot;The Whales of August&quot; (1987), Lillian Gish&#x27;s final film, circulated a petition urging Bowling Green State University to restore the names of actresses Dorothy and Lillian Gish to the film theater. The protest was signed by over 50 film-industry figures, including actors Helen Mirren and James Earl Jones and directors Bertrand Tavernier and Martin Scorsese.

==Personal life==

Gish never married or had children. Her association with D. W. Griffith was so close that some suspected a romantic connection, an issue never acknowledged by Gish, although several of their associates were certain they were at least briefly involved. For the remainder of her life, she always referred to him as &quot;Mr. Griffith&quot;. She was also involved with producer Charles Duell, and drama critic and editor George Jean Nathan. In the 1920s, Gish&#x27;s association with Duell became something of a tabloid scandal when he sued her and made the details of their relationship public.

Gish was a survivor of the 1918 flu pandemic, having contracted the illness during the filming of &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot;.

Gish became a vegetarian in her childhood through influence of her aunt and could not bear the thought of killing animals. Her vegetarianism became well known in 1925 as she was seen nibbling on a raw carrot in federal court. Newspaper photographs of her caused a carrot-eating fad across the United States. She later gave up vegetarianism and preferred to eat boiled eggs, fruit, meat, and vegetables.

She maintained a close relationship with her sister Dorothy and with Mary Pickford for her entire life. Another of her closest friends was actress Helen Hayes, the &quot;First Lady of the American Theatre&quot;. Gish was the godmother of Hayes&#x27;s son James MacArthur, and designated Hayes (who survived her by just 18 days) as a beneficiary of her estate.

Gish was a devout Episcopalian.

===Political views===
Gish was a staunch Republican, and was friendly with President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his wife, Mamie. She supported Richard Nixon in his failed 1960 presidential run, and was also friends with Ronald Reagan. During Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Gish wrote in a letter to Nancy Reagan, &quot;Every time you and Ronnie open your mouths you echo my thoughts.&quot;

During the period of political turmoil in the U.S. that lasted from the outbreak of World War II in Europe until the attack on Pearl Harbor, she maintained an outspoken noninterventionist stance. She was an active member of the America First Committee, an anti-intervention organization founded by a group of law students led by R. Douglas Stuart Jr., with aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh as its leading spokesman. She said she was blacklisted by the film and theater industries until she signed a contract in which she promised to cease her anti-interventionist activities and never disclose the fact that she had agreed to do so.

==Death==
Gish died of heart failure on February 27, 1993, at the age of 99. She was cremated and her ashes were interred beside those of her sister Dorothy at Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New York City. Her estate was valued at several million dollars, the bulk of which went toward the creation of the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize Trust.

==Legacy==

A retrospective of Gish&#x27;s life and achievements was showcased in an episode of the Emmy award-winning PBS series, &quot;American Masters&quot;.

The AllMovie Guide wrote on her legacy:

Turner Classic Movies wrote,
* The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize
* A street in Massillon, Ohio, is named after Gish, who had lived there during an early period of her life and fondly referred to it as her hometown throughout her career.
* François Truffaut&#x27;s movie &quot;Day for Night&quot; (1973) is dedicated to Dorothy and Lillian Gish.
* Gish&#x27;s photograph is mentioned as an inspiration for a troubled soldier in the 1933 novel &quot;Company K&quot;.
* The luxury boutique hotel Maison 140, in Beverly Hills, began its historic life as the home of Hollywood actresses Lillian and Dorothy Gish. The sisters originally converted the mansion into a home for young actresses coming out to find their way in Hollywood. Having hailed from Ohio, they understood the comforts that would be missed from home while exploring one&#x27;s dreams.

==In popular culture==
American rock band The Smashing Pumpkins named their 1991 debut album &quot;Gish&quot; after her. Singer Billy Corgan explained in an interview, &quot;My grandmother used to tell me that one of the biggest things that ever happened was when Lillian Gish rode through town on a train, my grandmother lived in the middle of nowhere, so that was a big deal...&quot;

&quot;Lillian Gish&quot; is Scottish rhyming slang for fish and urinating. An example of the latter occurs in the Scottish sitcom, &quot;Still Game&quot;, when Winston Ingram says, &quot;I&#x27;m away for a Lillian Gish&quot;meaning &quot;I&#x27;m away for a pish&quot; (&quot;pish&quot; being Scottish vernacular for piss).

American rock band Fruit Bats referenced Gish in the song &quot;Eagles Below Us&quot; from their 2021 release &quot;The Pet Parade&quot; with the lyrics “I’ve never seen you so lovely, Lillian Gish, soft lit.”

In 2024, East West Players in Los Angeles produced &quot;Unbroken Blossoms&quot;, a play depicting the making of &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot;. Gish was portrayed by Alexandra Hellquist.

<text>Collagraphy (sometimes spelled collography) is a printmaking process in which materials are glued or sealed to a rigid substrate (such as paperboard or wood) to create a plate. Once inked, the plate becomes a tool for imprinting the design onto paper or another medium. The resulting print is termed a collagraph. The term &quot;collagraph&quot; was coined by Glen Alps in the 1950s, and is derived from the Greek word &quot;koll&quot; or &quot;kolla&quot;, meaning glue, and &quot;graph&quot;, meaning the activity of drawing.

Artists use a variety of materials in collagraphy, including yarn, fabric, tape, different varieties of cut paper or card, leaves, and acrylic mediums. The application of ink onto the collagraph plate is versatile, consisting of intaglio-inking into recesses, brayer or paintbrush inking onto relief surfaces, or a combination of these methods. A print can be made with or without use of a press.

<text>The Fraser River () is the longest river within British Columbia, Canada, rising at Fraser Pass near Blackrock Mountain in the Rocky Mountains and flowing for , into the Strait of Georgia just south of the City of Vancouver. The river&#x27;s annual discharge at its mouth is or , and each year it discharges about 20 million tons of sediment into the ocean.

== Naming ==
The river is named after Simon Fraser, who led an expedition in 1808 on behalf of the North West Company from the site of present-day Prince George almost to the mouth of the river.
The river&#x27;s name in the Halqemeylem (Upriver Halkomelem) language is &#x27;, often seen archaically as Staulo, and has been adopted by the Halkomelem-speaking peoples of the Lower Mainland as their collective name, . The river&#x27;s name in the Dakelh language is &#x27;. The &quot;Tsilhqot&#x27;in&quot; name for the river, not dissimilar to the &quot;Dakelh&quot; name, is , meaning Sturgeon &quot;()&quot; River &quot;()&quot;.

==Course==

The Fraser drains a area. Its source is a dripping spring at Fraser Pass in the Canadian Rocky Mountains near the border with Alberta. The river then flows north to the Yellowhead Highway and west past Mount Robson to the Rocky Mountain Trench and the Robson Valley near Valemount. After running northwest past 54° north, it makes a sharp turn to the south at Giscome Portage, meeting the Nechako River at the city of Prince George, then continues south, progressively cutting deeper into the Fraser Plateau to form the Fraser Canyon from roughly the confluence of the Chilcotin River, near the city of Williams Lake, southwards. It is joined by the Bridge and Seton Rivers at the town of Lillooet, then by the Thompson River at Lytton, where it proceeds south until it is approximately north of the 49th parallel, which is Canada&#x27;s border with the United States.

From Lytton southwards it runs through a progressively deeper canyon between the Lillooet Ranges of the Coast Mountains on its west and the Cascade Range on its east. Hell&#x27;s Gate, located immediately downstream of the town of Boston Bar, is a famous portion of the canyon where the walls narrow dramatically, forcing the entire volume of the river through a gap only 35 metres (115 feet) wide. An aerial tramway takes visitors out over the river. Hells Gate is visible from Trans-Canada Highway 1 about south of the tramway. Simon Fraser was forced to portage the gorge on his trip through the canyon in June 1808.

At Yale, at the head of navigation on the river, the canyon opens up and the river widens, though without much adjoining lowland until Hope, where the river then turns west and southwest into the Fraser Valley, a lush lowland valley, and runs past Chilliwack and the confluence of the Harrison and Sumas Rivers, bending northwest at Abbotsford and Mission.

The Fraser then flows past Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, and north Surrey. It turns southwest again just east of New Westminster, where it splits into the North Arm, which is the southern boundary of the City of Vancouver, and the South Arm, which divides the City of Richmond from the City of Delta to the south. Richmond is on the largest island in the Fraser, Lulu Island and also on Sea Island, which is the location of Vancouver International Airport, where the Middle Arm branches off to the south from the North Arm. The far eastern end of Lulu Island is named Queensborough and is part of the City of New Westminster. Also in the lowermost Fraser, among other smaller islands, is Annacis Island, an important industrial and port area, which lies to the southeast of the eastern end of Lulu Island. Other notable islands in the lower Fraser are Barnston Island, Matsqui Island, Nicomen Island and Sea Bird Island. Other islands lie on the outer side of the estuary, most notably Westham Island, a wildfowl preserve, and Iona Island, the location of the main sewage plant for the City of Vancouver.

The Fraser&#x27;s delta empties into the Strait of Georgia between the mainland and Vancouver Island; the lands south of the City of Vancouver, including the cities of Richmond and Delta, sit on the flat flood plain. The islands of the delta include Iona Island, Sea Island, Lulu Island, Annacis Island, and a number of smaller islands. While the vast majority of the river&#x27;s drainage basin lies within British Columbia, a small portion in the drainage basin lies across the international border in Washington in the United States, namely the upper reaches of the tributary Chilliwack and Sumas rivers. Most of lowland Whatcom County, Washington is part of the Fraser Lowland and was formed also by sediment deposited from the Fraser, though most of the county is not in the Fraser drainage basin.

Similar to the Columbia River Gorge east of Portland, Oregon, the Fraser exploits a topographic cleft between two mountain ranges separating a more continental climate (in this case, that of the British Columbia Interior) from a milder climate near the coast. When an Arctic high-pressure area moves into the British Columbia Interior and a relatively low-pressure area builds over the general Puget Sound and Strait of Georgia region, the cold Arctic air accelerates southwest through the Fraser Canyon. These outflow winds can gust up to and have at times exceeded . Such winds frequently reach Bellingham and the San Juan Islands, gaining strength over the open water of the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

The estuary at the river&#x27;s mouth is a site of hemispheric importance in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.

===Discharge===
The Water Survey of Canada currently operates 17 gauge stations that measure discharge and water level along the majority of the mainstem from Red Pass just downstream of Moose Lake in the Mount Robson Provincial Park, to Steveston in Vancouver at the river mouth. With an average flow at the mouth of about , the Fraser is the largest river by discharge flowing into the Pacific seaboard of Canada and the fifth largest in the country. The average flow is highly seasonal; summer discharge rates can be ten times larger than the flow during the winter.

The Fraser&#x27;s highest recorded flow, in June 1894, is estimated to have been at Hope. It was calculated using high-water marks near the hydrometric station at Hope and various statistical methods. In 1948 the Fraser River Board adopted the estimate for the 1894 flood. It remains the value specified by regulatory agencies for all flood control work on the river. Further studies and hydraulic models have estimated the maximum discharge of the Fraser River, at Hope during the 1894 flood, as within a range of about .

==History==
The Maris Pacifici map published in 1589 features on the west coast of North-America the first ever representation of two major coastline features: the delta of the Fraser River labeled &quot;Baia de las isleas&quot; and the mouth of the Columbia River identified as &quot;Rio Grande&quot;. These rivers would therefore have been sighted by visitors long before official records would confirm. In spite of limited evidence of Francis Drake expedition whereabouts in the Pacific Northwest, BC history commentator Sam Bawlf posited that the Ortelius map was a proof that Drake sighted the mouth of the Fraser and came through the Strait of Juan de Fuca.. 


On June 14, 1792, the Spanish explorers Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés entered and anchored in the North Arm of the Fraser River, becoming the first Europeans to officially find and enter it. The existence of the river, but not its location, had been deduced during the 1791 voyage of José María Narváez, under Francisco de Eliza.

The upper reaches of the Fraser River were first explored by Sir Alexander Mackenzie in 1793, and fully traced by Simon Fraser in 1808, who confirmed that it was not connected with the Columbia River.

The lower Fraser was revisited in 1824 when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sent a crew across Puget Sound from its Fort George southern post on the Columbia River. The expedition was led by James McMillan. The Fraser was reached via the Nicomekl River and the Salmon River reachable after a portage. Friendly tribes met earlier on by the Simon Fraser crew were reacquainted with. A trading post with agricultural potential was to be located.

By 1827, a crew was sent back via the mouth of the Fraser to build and operate the original Fort Langley. McMillan also led the undertaking.
The trading post original location would soon become the first ever mixed ancestry and agricultural settlement in southern British Columbia on the Fraser (Sto:lo) river.

In 1828 George Simpson visited the river, mainly to examine Fort Langley and determine whether it would be suitable as the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s main Pacific depot. Simpson had believed the Fraser River might be navigable throughout its length, even though Simon Fraser had described it as non-navigable. Simpson journeyed down the river and through the Fraser Canyon and afterwards wrote &quot;I should consider the passage down, to be certain Death, in nine attempts out of Ten. I shall therefore no longer talk about it as a navigable stream&quot;. His trip down the river convinced him that Fort Langley could not replace Fort Vancouver as the company&#x27;s main depot on the Pacific coast.

Much of British Columbia&#x27;s history has been bound to the Fraser, partly because it was the essential route between the Interior and the Lower Coast after the loss of the lands south of the 49th Parallel with the Oregon Treaty of 1846. It was the site of its first recorded settlements of Aboriginal people (&quot;see&quot; Musqueam, , St&#x27;at&#x27;imc, Secwepemc and Nlaka&#x27;pamŭ), the site of the first European-Indigenous mixed ancestry settlement in southern British-Columbia (&quot;see&quot; Fort Langley), the route of multitudes of prospectors during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and the main vehicle of the province&#x27;s early commerce and industry.

In 1998, the river was designated as a Canadian Heritage River for its natural and human heritage. It remains the longest river with that designation.

==Uses==

The Fraser is heavily exploited by human activities, especially in its lower reaches. Its banks are rich farmland, its water is used by pulp mills, and a few dams on some tributaries provide hydroelectric power. The main flow of the Fraser has never been dammed partly because its high level of sediment flows would result in a short dam lifespan, but mostly because of strong opposition from fisheries and other environmental concerns. In 1858, the Fraser River and surrounding areas were occupied when the gold rush came to the Fraser Canyon and the Fraser River. It is also a popular fishing location for residents of the Lower Mainland.

The delta of the river, especially in the Boundary Bay area, is an important stopover location for migrating shorebirds.

The Fraser Herald, a regional position within the Canadian Heraldic Authority, is named after the river.

==Fishing==
The Fraser River is known for the fishing of white sturgeon, all five species of Pacific salmon (chinook, coho, chum, pink, sockeye), as well as steelhead trout. The Fraser River is also the largest producer of salmon in Canada. A typical white sturgeon catch can average about . 
A white sturgeon weighing an estimated and measuring was caught and released on the Fraser River in July 2012. In 2021, a white sturgeon was caught on the river weighing , with a length of . It was estimated to be over 100 years old. The fish was tagged and released.

==Flooding==
The most significant Fraser river floods in recorded history occurred in 1894 and 1948.

===1894 flood===

After European settlement, the first disastrous flood in the Lower Mainland (Fraser Valley and Metro Vancouver) occurred in 1894. With no protection against the rising waters of the Fraser River, Fraser Valley and Metro Vancouver communities from Chilliwack downstream were inundated with water. In the 1894 floods, the water mark at Mission reached .

After the 1894 flood, a dyking system was constructed throughout the Fraser Valley. The dyking and drainage projects greatly improved the flood problems, but over time, the dykes were allowed to fall into disrepair and became overgrown with brush and trees. With some dykes constructed of a wooden frame, they gave way in 1948 in several locations, marking the second disastrous flood. Flooding since 1948 has been minor in comparison.

===1948 flood===

1948 saw massive flooding in Chilliwack and other areas along the Fraser River. The high-water mark at Mission rose to . The peak flow was about 15,600 cubic meters per second.

====Timeline====

*On May 28, 1948, the Semiault Creek Dyke broke.
*On May 29, 1948, dykes near Glendale (now Cottonwood Corners) gave way and in four days, of fertile ground were under water.
*On June 1, 1948, the Cannor Dyke (east of Vedder Canal near Trans Canada Highway) broke and released tons of Fraser River water onto the Greendale area, destroying homes and fields.
*On June 3, 1948, the steamer &quot;Gladys&quot; supplied flood-stricken Chilliwack with tents and provisions as well as moving people and stock onto high ground.

====Causes====
Cool temperatures in March, April, and early May had delayed the melting of the heavy snowpack that had accumulated over the winter season. Several days of hot weather and warm rains over the holiday weekend in late May hastened the thawing of the snowpack. Rivers and streams quickly swelled with spring runoff, reaching heights surpassed only in 1894. Finally, the poorly maintained dyke systems failed to contain the water.

At the height of the 1948 flood, stood under water. Dykes broke at Agassiz, Chiliwack, Nicomen Island, Glen Valley and Matsqui. When the flood waters receded a month later, 16,000 people had been evacuated, with damages totaling $20 million, about $225 million in 2020 dollars.

===1972 flood===
Major flooding occurred once again in 1972 due to a significant spring freshet, primarily impacting regions around Prince George, Kamloops, Hope and Surrey.

===2007 flood===
Due to record snowpacks on the mountains in the Fraser River catch basin which began melting, combined with heavy rainfall, water levels on the Fraser River rose in 2007 to a level not reached since 1972. Low-lying land in areas upriver such as Prince George suffered minor flooding. Evacuation alerts were given for the low-lying areas not protected by dikes in the Lower Mainland. However, the water levels did not breach the dikes, and major flooding was averted.

===2021 flood===

Major flooding occurred in November 2021 as part of the November 2021 Pacific Northwest floods.

<text>A Pyrrhic victory ( ) is a victory that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is to defeat. Such a victory negates any true sense of achievement or damages long-term progress. 

The phrase originates from a quote from Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose triumph against the Romans in the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC destroyed much of his forces, forcing the end of his campaign.

==Etymology==

A &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot; is named after King Pyrrhus of Epirus, whose army suffered irreplaceable casualties in defeating the Romans at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC and the Battle of Asculum in 279 BC, during the Pyrrhic War. After the latter battle, Plutarch relates in a report by Dionysius:

In both Epirote victories, the Romans suffered greater casualties, but they had a much larger pool of replacements, so the casualties had less impact on the Roman war effort than the losses had on the campaign of King Pyrrhus.

The report is often quoted as:

or
==Examples==
===War===

This list comprises examples of battles that ended in a Pyrrhic victory. It is not intended to be complete but to illustrate the concept.

* Battle of Asculum (279 BC), Pyrrhus of Epirus and Italian allies against the Roman Republic: the Romans, though suffering twice as many casualties, could easily replenish their ranks. Pyrrhus lost most of his commanders and a great part of the forces he had brought to Italy, and he withdrew to Sicily.
* Battle of Avarayr (451), Vardan Mamikonian and Christian Armenian rebels against the Sassanid Empire: the Persians were victorious and forced the outnumbered Armenians to retreat, but lost so many soldiers that the battle proved to be a strategic victory for Armenians, as Avarayr paved the way to the Nvarsak Treaty (AD 484), which assured Armenian autonomy and religious freedom.
* Siege of Szigetvár (1566), Ottoman–Habsburg wars: although the Ottomans won the siege after 33 days, it can be seen as a Pyrrhic victory because of the heavy Ottoman casualties, the death of Sultan Suleiman, and the resulting delay to the Ottoman push for Vienna that year which suspended Ottoman expansion in Europe.
* Siege of Ostend (1601–1604), Eighty Years&#x27; War: for three years the Spanish attempted to capture this port from Dutch and English defenders, even as the Dutch expanded their territory further east – including capturing the port of Sluis to replace Ostend before surrendering. The Spaniards ultimately captured the city, but the vast cost and casualties of the siege were compounded by Spain&#x27;s subsequent campaign to recapture the Dutch gains, which achieved little, and by 1607 Spain was bankrupt. The resultant Twelve Years&#x27; Truce effectively made the Dutch Republic an independent state.
* Battle of Gangwana (1741) fought between 1,000 strong Rathore cavalry of Jodhpur and combined armies of Mughal Empire, and Jaipur numbering 100,000 with hundreds of cannons and artillery at Gangwana. Jaipur emerged victorious but with heavy losses of 12,000 killed and thousands other wounded
* Battle of Bunker Hill (1775), American Revolutionary War: after mounting three assaults on the colonial forces, the British won control of the Boston peninsula in the early stages of the war, but the engagement cost them many more casualties than the Americans had incurred (including a large number of officers) and led them to adopt more cautious methods, which helped American rebel forces; the political repercussions increased colonial support for independence.
* Battle of Guilford Court House (1781), American Revolutionary War: in this short battle, the outnumbered British force defeated an American army; the British lost a considerable number of men, and their drive to conquer the southern colonies changed course.
* Battle of Chancellorsville (1863), American Civil War: General Robert E. Lee split his army in the face of Joseph Hooker&#x27;s larger Union force; the audacious strategy allowed the Confederate army to win the day against a numerically superior foe. However, 20% of Lee&#x27;s army was injured or killed, including General Stonewall Jackson, and his losses were difficult to replace. Lee&#x27;s weakened army went on the offensive, but less than two months later was defeated and forced to retreat after the Battle of Gettysburg.
* Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands (1942), World War II, Solomon Islands Campaign: Japanese and Allied naval forces met during the struggle for Guadalcanal and nearby islands. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, U.S. surface ships retreated with one aircraft carrier sunk along with a destroyer and another carrier and a battleship severely damaged. The Japanese carrier forces achieved a tactical victory, as none of their ships were sunk, but the heavy loss of 100 airplanes and irreplaceable veteran aircrews was to the strategic advantage of the Allies. Japanese ground forces on Guadalcanal had also just lost the Battle for Henderson Field and were in no position to take advantage of the new situation.
* Battle of Chosin Reservoir (1950), Korean War: the Chinese army attempted to encircle and destroy the much smaller United Nations forces, but in a 17-day battle in freezing weather, the U.N. forces inflicted crippling losses on the Chinese while making a fighting withdrawal. The Chinese occupied northeast Korea but they did not recover until the spring, and the U.N. maintained a foothold in Korea.
* Second Battle of Quảng Trị (1972), Vietnam War: South Vietnam defeated communist North Vietnam to recapture Quảng Trị Province south of the Thạch Hãn River at a high cost in terms of damage and destruction. The 1973 Paris Agreement, signed later, also became a disaster for South Vietnam. The South fell to communism in 1975
* Battle of Vukovar (1991), Croatian War of Independence: the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) laid siege to the city of Vukovar, held by the Croatian National Guard and civilian volunteers. After 87 days, the ruined city fell to the JNA. Although the city was besieged from all sides, it exhausted the Yugoslav army and Serbian paramilitaries that had about twenty times more soldiers and complete armoured and artillery superiority, and they had twice as many losses. It was a turning point in the Croatian War of Independence.

===Politics, sports and law===

The term is used as an analogy in business, politics and sports to describe struggles that end up ruining the victor. A Pyrrhic victory in a sporting context could range from a team winning a game yet a star player gets hurt in the process, or a win costing them an opportunity at a better selection in the draft.

Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr commented on the necessity of coercion in preserving the course of justice by warning,

In &quot;Beauharnais v. Illinois&quot;, a 1952 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving a charge proscribing group libel, Associate Justice Black alluded to Pyrrhus in his dissent,

<doc id="197741" wikidata="Q3921059" url="?curid=197741" title="Relief printing">
<text>Relief printing is a family of printing methods where a printing block, plate or matrix, which has had ink applied to its non-recessed surface, is brought into contact with paper. The non-recessed surface will leave ink on the paper, whereas the recessed areas will not. A printing press may not be needed, as the back of the paper can be rubbed or pressed by hand with a simple tool such as a brayer or roller. In contrast, in intaglio printing, the &quot;recessed&quot; areas are printed.

Relief printing is one of the traditional families of printmaking techniques, along with the intaglio and planographic families, though modern developments have created others.

== The relief family of techniques ==
In the relief family of printing, the matrix was historically made subtractively, by removing material from the surface of areas not intended to be printed. The remaining surface would then receive ink. The relief family of techniques includes woodcut, metalcut, wood engraving, relief etching, linocut, rubber stamp, foam printing, potato printing, and some types of collagraph.

By contrast, in the intaglio family of printing, the recessed areas are printed by inking the whole matrix, then wiping the surface so that only ink in the recessed areas remain. Much greater pressure is then needed to force the paper into the channels containing the ink, so a high-pressure press is normally needed. Intaglio techniques include engraving, etching, and drypoint.

In the planographic family of printing, the entire surface of the matrix is flat, and some areas are treated to create the print image. Planographic techniques include lithography and offset lithography.

=== Mix relief and intaglio techniques ===
Normally, relief and intaglio techniques can only be mixed with others of the same family in the same printed page, unless the page is printed twice.

=== Movable type: traditional relief printing for text ===
Traditional text printing with movable type is also a relief technique. This meant that woodcuts were much easier to use as book illustrations, as they could be printed together with the text. Intaglio illustrations, such as engravings, had to be printed separately.

The first relief-printed publication in the US, the multi-page newspaper &quot;Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick&quot;, was published on September 25, 1690.

<doc id="197742" wikidata="Q131448" url="?curid=197742" title="Sambucus">
<text>Sambucus is a genus of between 20-30 species of flowering plants in the family Adoxaceae. The various species are commonly referred to as elder, with the flowers as elderflower, and the fruit as elderberry.

== Description ==
Elders are mostly fast-growing shrubs or small trees (rarely to ) tall, with a few species being herbaceous plants tall. The oppositely arranged leaves are pinnate with 5–9 leaflets (or, rarely, 3 or 11). Each leaf is long, and the leaflets have serrated margins. They bear large clusters of small white or cream-coloured flowers in late spring or early summer; these are followed by clusters of small berries that are green when immature, ripening black, blue-black, or red (rarely yellow or white).

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of the genus &quot;Sambucus&quot; , originally described by Carl Linnaeus and hence its botanical authority, has been complicated by its wide geographical distribution and morphological diversity. This has led to overdescription of the species and infraspecific taxa (subspecies, varieties or forms).

The genus was formerly placed in the honeysuckle family Caprifoliaceae, but was reclassified in the moschatel family Adoxaceae due to genetic and morphological comparisons to plants in the genus &quot;Adoxa&quot;.

Species currently accepted by Plants of the World Online in this genus are:

* &quot;Sambucus adnata&quot; Wall. ex DC.
* &quot;Sambucus africana&quot; Standl.
* &quot;Sambucus australasica&quot; (Lindl.) Fritsch
* &quot;Sambucus australis&quot; Cham. &amp; Schltdl.

* &quot;Sambucus javanica&quot; Reinw. ex Blume
* &quot;Sambucus kamtschatica&quot; E.L.Wolf
* &quot;Sambucus lanceolata&quot; R.Br.
* &quot;Sambucus mexicana&quot; C.Presl ex DC.
* &quot;Sambucus nigra&quot; L.

=== Etymology ===
The name comes from the Ancient Greek word (), an ancient wind instrument, about the removal of pith from the twigs to make whistles.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The genus occurs in temperate to subtropical regions of the world. More widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, its Southern Hemisphere occurrence is restricted to parts of Australasia and South America. Many species are widely cultivated for their ornamental leaves, flowers, and fruit.

Elder commonly grows near farms and homesteads. It is a nitrogen-tolerant plant and thus is often found near places of organic waste disposal. Elders are often grown as a hedgerow plant in Britain since they take very fast, can be bent into shape easily, and grow quite profusely, thus having gained the reputation of being &#x27;an instant hedge&#x27;. It is not generally affected by soil type or pH level and will virtually grow anywhere sufficient sunlight is available.

== Ecology ==
The berries are consumed by birds and mammals. In Northern California, elderberries are eaten by migrating band-tailed pigeons. Elders are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including brown-tail, buff ermine, dot moth, emperor moth, engrailed moth, swallow-tailed moth and the . The crushed foliage and immature fruit have a strong fetid smell. Valley elderberry longhorn beetles in California are very often found around red or blue elderberry bushes. Females lay their eggs on the bark. Strong-scented flowers in wild populations of European elder (&quot;S. nigra&quot;) attract numerous, minute flower thrips which may contribute to the transfer of pollen between inflorescences.

== Cultivation ==
Traditional uses of &quot;Sambucus&quot; involved berries, seeds, leaves, and flowers or component extracts. Ornamental varieties of &quot;Sambucus&quot; are grown in gardens for their showy flowers, fruits and lacy foliage which support habitat for wildlife. Of the many native species, three are used as ornamentals: &quot;S. canadensis&quot;, &quot;S. nigra&quot;, and &quot;S. racemosa&quot;.

== Toxicity ==
The uncooked berries and other parts of plants from this genus are poisonous. Leaves, twigs, branches, seeds, roots, flowers, and berries of &quot;Sambucus&quot; plants produce cyanogenic glycosides, which have toxic properties. Ingesting a sufficient quantity of cyanogenic glycosides from berry juice, flower tea, or beverages made from fresh leaves, branches, and fruit has been shown to cause illness, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and weakness. In August 1983, a group of 25 people in Monterey County, California, became ill after ingesting elderberry juice pressed from fresh, uncooked &quot;S. mexicana&quot; berries, leaves, and stems. The concentration of cyanogenic glycosides is higher in tea made from flowers (or leaves) than from the berries.

The seeds of &quot;Sambucus racemosa&quot; are reported to be poisonous and may cause vomiting or diarrhea.

== Uses ==
The cooked berries (pulp and skin) of most species of &quot;Sambucus&quot; are edible.

=== Nutrition ===
Raw elderberries are 80% water, 18% carbohydrates, and less than 1% each of protein and fat. In a amount, elderberries supply of food energy and are a rich source of vitamin C, providing 43% of the Daily Value (DV). Elderberries also have moderate contents of vitamin B6 (18% DV) and iron (12% DV), with no other nutrients in significant content.

=== Chemistry ===
&quot;Sambucus&quot; fruit is rich in anthocyanidins that combine to give elderberry juice an intense blue-purple colour that turns reddish on dilution with water.

===Dietary supplement===
Elderberry fruit or flowers are used as dietary supplements to prevent or provide relief from minor diseases, such as flu, colds, constipation, and other conditions, served as a tea, extract or in a capsule. The use of elderberry supplements increased early in the COVID-19 pandemic. There is insufficient research to establish its effectiveness for such uses, or its safety profile. The raw or unripe fruit of &quot;S. nigra&quot; or its extracts may contain a cyanogenic glycoside that is potentially toxic.

=== Traditional medicine ===

Although practitioners of traditional medicine have used elderberries over centuries, there is little high-quality clinical evidence that such practices provide benefits.

===Pigments===
The pigments are used as colourants in various products, and &quot;elderberry juice color&quot; is listed by the US Food and Drug Administration as allowable in certified organic food products. In Japan, elderberry juice is listed as an approved &quot;natural colour additive&quot; under the Food and Sanitation Law. Fibres can be dyed with elderberry juice (using alum as a mordant) to give a &quot;muted purple&quot; shade.

===Other===
The berry of &quot;S. racemosa&quot; can be made into wine. The flowers of &quot;S. nigra&quot; are used to produce elderflower cordial. St-Germain, a French liqueur, is made from elderflowers. Hallands Fläder, a Swedish akvavit, is flavoured with elderflowers.

Hollowed elderberry twigs have traditionally been used as spiles to tap maple trees for syrup. Additionally, they have been hollowed out and used as flutes, blowguns, and syringes. In addition, the elderberry twigs and fruit are employed in creating dyes for basketry. These stems are dyed a very deep black by soaking them in a wash made from the berry stems of the elderberry.

The pith of elder has been used by watchmakers for cleaning tools before intricate work.

== In culture ==
Folklore related to elder trees is extensive and can vary according to region. In some traditions, the elder tree is thought to ward off evil and give protection from witches, while other beliefs say that witches often congregate under the plant, especially when it is full of fruit. If an elder tree was cut down, a spirit known as the Elder Mother would be released and take her revenge. The tree could only safely be cut while chanting a rhyme to the Elder Mother. Romani people believe burning elder wood brings bad luck.

A wand made from the branch of an elder tree plays a pivotal role in the final book of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, which was almost named &quot;Harry Potter and the Elder Wand&quot;.

<text>Johan Ludvig Runeberg (; 5 February 1804 – 6 May 1877) was a Finnish priest, lyric and epic poet. He wrote exclusively in Swedish. He is considered a national poet of Finland. He is the author of the lyrics to (&quot;Our Land&quot;, in Finnish) which became the Finnish national anthem. Runeberg was also involved in the modernization of the Finnish Lutheran hymnal and produced many texts for the new edition.

== Background ==
=== Childhood ===
Runeberg was born into a Swedish-speaking family in Jakobstad, Finland, on the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia. His parents were sea captain Lorentz Ulrik Runeberg (1772–1828) and Anna Maria Malm (1782–1834). His paternal grandfather Ludvig had moved to Finland from Sweden, and Anna Maria Malm was born to a merchant family from Jakobstad, which probably also had their roots in Sweden.

As a child, Runeberg suffered from scrofula, which led to glandular swelling. His physical development slowed down due to illness so that he did not learn to walk until he was three or four years old. From his father, Johan inherited a manly and brisk character, and from his mother, he inherited sensitivity and artistic talent.

=== Education ===
At the age of eight, Runeberg was sent to live with his uncle and attend school in Oulu. Runeberg studied in the city of Vaasa and later on at the Imperial Academy of Turku, where he befriended Johan Vilhelm Snellman and Zacharias Topelius. His studies concentrated mainly on the classical languages of Latin and Greek. He earned a Master of Philosophy during 1827. He served as a tutor (1822–1826), docent at the Imperial Alexander University (1830) and teacher at the Swedish-language Helsingfors Lyceum (1831–1836). 

From 1837, he lived in Porvoo, where he served as professor of Latin literature in the Borgå gymnasium. Runeberg was the tutor of Carl Henrik Alopaeus, who would later become the bishop of Porvoo and an educator of the deaf. Runeberg also supported Carl Oscar Malm&#x27;s school for the deaf in Porvoo (at which Alopaeus taught) as well as serving on the school board. Finnish salon hostess Natalia Castrén (1830–1881) was a member of Runeberg&#x27;s cultural circle.

==Poetry==
Many of his poems deal with life in rural Finland. The best known of these is , (&quot;Farmer Paavo&quot;, in Finnish), about a smallholding peasant farmer in the poor parish of Saarijärvi and his determination, &quot;sisu&quot; (guts) and unwavering faith in providence in the face of a harsh climate and years of bad harvests. Three times, a frosty night destroys his crops. Every time, he mixes double the amount of bark into his bark bread to stave off starvation and works ever harder to dry off marsh into dryer land that would not be as exposed to the night frost. After the fourth year, Paavo finally gets a rich crop. As his wife exults, thanks God and tells Paavo to enjoy full bread made entirely out of grain, Paavo instructs his wife to mix bark into grain once more, because their neighbour&#x27;s crop has been lost in a frost and he gives half of his crop to the needy neighbour.

==Selected works==
Runeberg&#x27;s main works included the idealist poem &quot;&quot; (Elk Hunters, 1832) and the epic (King Fjalar, 1844). The heroic poem (The Tales of Ensign Stål, in Finnish) written between 1848 and 1860 is considered the greatest Finnish epic poem outside the native Kalevala tradition and contains tales of the Finnish War of 1808–09 with Russia. In the war, Sweden ignominiously lost Finland, which became a Grand Duchy in the Russian Empire. The epic, which is composed episodically, emphasizes the common humanity of all sides in the conflict, while principally lauding the heroism of the Finns. The first poem (&quot;Our Land&quot;, in Finnish) became the unofficial Finnish National Anthem.

==Personal life==
He was married to his second cousin Fredrika Runeberg, née Tengström, who wrote poems and novels. They were the parents of eight children, including the sculptor Walter Runeberg, who was their eldest son. He also had several emotional affairs throughout his life, most notably with Maria Prytz and the younger poet Emilie Björkstén.

Johan Ludvig Runeberg met poet Fredrika Wenman at a school in Vaasa. Runeberg dedicated his poem to Frigga. However, the courtship ended when Runeberg left to study at the Royal Academy of Turku in 1823.

== Legacy ==

Runeberg Day (Finnish: ) is celebrated annually on 5 February, the day of Runeberg&#x27;s birth. A pastry flavored with almonds called Runeberg&#x27;s torte (Finnish: ; Swedish: ) is generally available in stores from the beginning of January until 5 February.

There is a statue of Johan Ludwig Runeberg by his son Walter Runeberg on Esplanadi in the heart of Helsinki. Runeberg Township in Becker County, Minnesota was also named after Runeberg.

The Runeberginkatu street in central Helsinki is named after him.

Runeberg was selected as the main motif of the Finnish commemorative coin, the €10 Johan Ludvig Runeberg and Finnish Poetry commemorative coin. It was minted in 2004 celebrating the 200th anniversary of his birth. The obverse of the coin features a stylized portrait of Runeberg&#x27;s face. The reverse features an 1831 font sample from the Swedish-language newspaper , since Runeberg wrote most of his work in Swedish.

<doc id="197744" wikidata="Q590205" url="?curid=197744" title="Prince George, British Columbia">
<text>Prince George is a city in British Columbia, Canada, situated at the confluence of the Fraser and Nechako rivers. The city itself has a population of 76,708; the metro census agglomeration has a population of 89,490. It is often called the province&#x27;s &quot;northern capital&quot;. because it serves as a centre for higher education, health care, government services, arts and entertainment, sports, and support for major industries such as forest products and mining.

== History ==

The origins of Prince George can be traced to the North West Company fur trading post of Fort George, which was established in 1807 by Simon Fraser and named in honour of King George III. The post was centred in the centuries-old homeland of the Lheidli T&#x27;enneh First Nation, whose name means &quot;people of the confluence of the two rivers.&quot; The Lheidli T&#x27;enneh name began to see official use around the 1990s and the band is otherwise historically referred to as Fort George Indian Band.

=== 1800s ===

Throughout the 19th century, HBC Fort George trading post remained unchanged, and Fort St. James reigned as the main trading post and capital of the New Caledonia area. Even during the Cariboo Gold Rush, Fort George was isolated from the newfound trade. Then, when the Collins Overland Telegraph Trail was built in 1865–67, it bypassed Fort George trading post, following the Blackwater Trail from Quesnel and continuing northwest towards Hazelton. In the late 1800s many Lheidli T&#x27;enneh lived in a village built next to the HBC trading post due to the ease of preparing furs and trading directly, without great distances to travel.

=== Townsite development and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway ===
In 1903, the area&#x27;s fortune began to change when reports said that the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (later part of Canadian National Railway) would pass near the fur trading post. In 1906, agricultural settlement began around the HBC post and then in 1909, development of two townsites began as two rival land speculation companies built the communities of South Fort George and Fort George (sometimes referred to as Central Fort George). South Fort George was built on the Fraser River near to and just south of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s trading post. The GTP meanwhile was trying to acquire land for its own townsite which delayed the constructions of what would become Prince George for several years.

==== Fort George townsite ====
Fort George townsite was built to the northwest on the Nechako River. The name had been registered by the district lot original purchasers with some concerns due to its similarity to the HBC trading post&#x27;s name. George Hammond, the CEO of the Natural Resources Security Company, bought nine district lots and promoted his community of Fort George in exaggerated and questionable advertisements all over Canada and Britain, describing Fort George in glowing terms as being the future hub of British Columbia, the &quot;Chicago of the north&quot;, and having mild winters and being suitable for any agricultural endeavour. Hammond claimed the existence of buildings and facilities in advertising when none existed at the time. Lots sold in 1912 for $400, rising to $500-$1,000 by 1913.

Ten paddle steamer sternwheelers serviced the area, coming up on the Fraser River from Soda Creek docking at both South Fort George and Fort George Townsite.

==== South Fort George ====
South Fort George developed close to the near defunct HBC post, along the Fraser River after being purchased in 1909 by the Northern Development Company, with lots going on sale in 1910. BC Express Company paddle wheelers landed in South Fort George and the area grew with speculation about the railway coming to the area. South Fort George would remain its own community until 1976 when it incorporated into the City of Prince George.
==== Growth and creation of Prince George ====

Properties were sold in both of the townsites with railway speculation driving up prices. By 1913, South Fort George and Fort George each had a population of around 1,500 and were booming as thousands of rail construction workers came to town for supplies and entertainment. Both communities believed that the Grand Trunk Pacific station would be built in their town, and both were disappointed when the railway purchased the of land in between them from the Lhiedli T&#x27;enneh instead, even though Charles Vance Millar, then the owner of the BC Express Company, was well into negotiations to purchase that property himself. The railway compensated Millar by giving him of the property and, by 1914, when the railway was completed and the first train arrived, there were four major communities in the area: South Fort George, Fort George Townsite, the Millar Addition and the railway&#x27;s townsite, Prince George, where the station was built. Hammond also developed his lots further, including additions such as Central Fort George. Although George Hammond fought a series of bitter legal battles for a railway station in Fort George. The Railway argued against a station in Fort George as it was their investment and risk, thus they would build a station in a townsite of their own (Prince George). Plans for the townsite for Prince George were created by Brett and Hall of Boston, and the land cleared in May 1913.

Fort George, South Fort George, and Prince George pursued the right to incorporate with initial proposals including all three townsites. The GTP shows no interest in including Fort George, and South Fort George left the negotiations. The GTP lands now known as the City of Prince George were incorporated on March 6, 1915, following the borders of the 1,366 acres they had initially acquired. At this time, many owners of Prince George businesses, particularly ones on George Street, lived in South Fort George. As the Prince George townsite developed and grew, many buildings were moved from the older townsites to the new business areas of Prince George, often being rolled into the city.

==== Lheidli T&#x27;enneh Village and the railway ====
In 1908, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway identified the Reserve No.1 land as an ideal area for a railway and station site, and attempted to claim all the 1366 acres as needed for railway purposes. This was rejected due to the Department of Indian Affairs. The Department of Indian Affairs wished to protect the Lheidli T&#x27;enneh&#x27;s interests but also supported railway development.

Between 1908 and 1911 several offers for the acquisition of the Reserve No.1 lands were made by the GTP and others such as Charles Millar (of BC Express) who wanted to develop the land. The Department of Indian Affairs in conjunction with railroad representatives made several offers for the land. In 1910 Chief Louis described the attachment to the land and village to McDougall, who reported that &quot;Land, Cash, and farm equipment&quot; would be needed to overcome resistance, and the band was considered to be averse to a sale. McDougall met with Chief Louis again in December 1910 offering $68,300 ($50/acre) but Chief Louis told McDougall that &quot;they could not in their present mind surrender this reserve&quot;. A vote was held at a meeting two days later with members of the Band over age 21. The vote approved the surrender of the reserve land 12–11, but Chief Louis asked to talk with his people and the Band did not consider the vote final. The Band appointed Oblate Missionary E.C Bellot as an emissary to Ottawa with a larger cash demand of $1000 per acre, which was refused by DIA representatives. Upon return to Fort George, a new vote by the Band unanimously turned down the sale. During this time, the business developers of Fort George Townsite opposed the sale of the reserve lands as it would lead to its rival building a competing town while South Fort George, which was built close to the old HBC Post and the village, welcomed the railway and its townsite.

In 1911, federal Indian agent W.J. MacAllan took on the negotiations with assistance from Nicolas Coccola, a reverend. Coccola had interests in the well-being of the Lheidli T&#x27;enneh but was also negotiating on behalf of the railway company which might connect to his mission on Stuart Lake. Father Coccola had wanted to relocated the Lheidli T&#x27;enneh to a safer area where they would be away from settlers and could be schooled in agriculture and in religion. Coccola suggested to the band that &quot;if it tolerated intoxicating liquor and moral disorders, he would be the first to insist to have them removed&quot;. Coccola made several statements that he would convince or persuade the Band to relocate if they refused offers, and even involved himself in pricing amounts that could be offers to the Lheidli T&#x27;enneh. With several offers and refusals, the Lheidli T&#x27;enneh saw a split in support for a land sale. Chief Louis favored the surrender of the land, but Joseph Quah, an influential leader in the Band, wanted a higher price.

On 18 November 1911, The Fort George Indian Band eventually agreed to sell the Reserve No.1 lands for $125,000 (one quarter to be paid immediately) which included $25,000 for construction on reserve No.2 and No.3 and the preservation of the original village cemetery. The band committed to relocate by June 1912. The vote for this agreement saw 32 in favor and one against, and three abstentions. The timeline was difficult to keep as new buildings had to be constructed. Delays in contracts being awarded by the government to build a new village meant that few could move by the deadline and Band members planted crops needed later in the year. The June 1912 payment was withheld as the DIA saw the planting as refusal to leave. Chief Louis argued that the agreement stated that the payment was to be made in June and was not contingent on relocation. Winter was also coming and the crops would be needed if the new village was not built or supplies given to the Band.

The new village was completed in 1913 with Band members moving there in September. The old village was destroyed &quot;to force the Indians away&quot; and ensure that it was not reoccupied. The Fort George Herald reported the destruction of the old village as &quot;the torch of the white man will be thrust into the remaining houses and the village will disappear quietly in a cloud of smoke&quot;. Indian Agent W. J. MacAllan&#x27;s accounts of the situation reveal a need on his part and the part of the GTP to strong-arm the band members out, targeting two cabins in the village that were empty as the residents were away hunting &quot;I knew that to set fire to the cabins would cause a flare up of intense excitement and give me the break I needed, for a crisis had to be created before the deadlock could be broken&quot;.

The site of Reserve No.2 (Shelley) was much further away from the new Prince George townsite and other communities. The land was not particularly fertile for agriculture and the Band suffered economically. The site of the old village and the HBC post would become Fort George Park (renamed Lheidli T&#x27;enneh Memorial Park in 2015). The Cemetery would become Reserve No.1A.

=== Etymology ===
There were three rationales given for naming the new city as &quot;Prince George&quot;:
*In 1911, Grand Trunk Railway documents justified the name to clearly distinguish it from nearby Fort George neighbourhoods.
*In 1914, the railway said that the name would honour the recently crowned King George V. One suggestion recommended the name &quot;George&quot;.
*A third rationale was to honour Prince George, Duke of Kent, the fourth son of reigning King George V.
Businessmen in Fort George petitioned the provincial government to block the new name but they were unsuccessful. In May 1915, residents voted by plebiscite to name the new city as &quot;Prince George&quot; with a vote of 153–13.

=== First World War ===
With the onset of World War I in 1914, the local economy was devastated as many local men enlisted and the construction of the Pacific Great Eastern Railway was halted, creating a massive drop in population. Many men enlisted in Prince George from the surrounding communities and were primarily sent to Vernon, BC for training before being shipped overseas. 17 names of soldiers who died in World War I are inscribed on the cenotaph, although many more enlisted. Population decline continued with the ensuing Spanish flu epidemic of 1918. The epidemic took at least fifty lives in the area, including First Nations leaders.

=== 1920s and 1930s ===
Prince George persevered through the 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s and did not experience any significant growth until World War II when an army camp was built at the foot of Cranbrook Hill, bringing new life to the struggling businesses and service industries. The Great Depression saw massive decline in lumber production in the region, falling from 105 million board feet in 1929 to only 15 million board feet by 1932 and a significant increase in unemployment. Unemployed men were often housed in one of several relief camps east of Prince George, where the men worked on construction projects or remained idle; away from the city of Prince George. Between 1930 and 1935, Prince George and the work camps were home to labor protests and sit ins organized by a local branch of the Communist sympathizing National Unemployed Workers Association, who sought basic needs for the unemployed.

In the 1920s air transport began with sea planes and landing on Central Avenue. In the 1930s Prince George saw air transport increase and became a hub for air mail to Takla Landing, Fort St. James, and Mansons Landing, later including stops in Edmonton, Whitehorse, and Fort Nelson and an airport was developed by Carney Hill (The Golf Course today). In 1939, Prince George was selected as a spot for an aerodrome, and construction began on what is now Prince George Airport.

=== Second World War ===
Army Camp Prince George was opened during WWII and once housed 6,000 soldiers. From March 1942 to October 1943, divisional troops and units of the 16th Infantry Brigade (8th Canadian Infantry Division) were housed there. The camp was located in the area of 1st Street, Central Street, 15th Avenue, to the bottom of Cranbrook Hill. Barracks were built to house the soldiers, dining halls constructed to feed them, and wet canteens for their leisure and entertainment. There were rifle ranges, mortar ranges and artillery ranges. The camp closed at the end of the war. Most of the buildings were either demolished or moved to new locations, although some remain in their original locations, such as the former transportation building on 15th Avenue, that was used by the British Columbia Forestry Service from the late 1940s to 1963. It is now owned by the City of Prince George for use by the Community Arts Council. The Nechako Bottle Depot on First Avenue is also another former camp building. Others include the first Overwaitea store, at Victoria and Third, formerly a barracks and the original civic centre, which was the old drill shed, was removed and rebuilt on Seventh Avenue. Population during the war saw 2,027 in 1941 rising to 3,800 in Prince George by 1945.

After the war, as the ravaged European cities rebuilt, the demand for lumber skyrocketed and Prince George, with its abundance of sawmills and spruce trees, prospered. Finally, in 1952, after 40 years of construction, the Pacific Great Eastern was completed and joined with the CN line at Prince George, and with the completion of Highways 16 and 97, Prince George finally fulfilled George Hammond&#x27;s long ago promise of being the hub of British Columbia.

=== Modern history ===
Canadian Forces Station Baldy Hughes (ADC ID: C-20) was constructed in 1952 as a General Surveillance Radar station. It was located south-southwest of Prince George, and was closed in 1988. It was operated as part of the Pinetree Line network controlled by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Today the former station is The Baldy Hughes Addiction Treatment Centre. The original radar system has been removed and the location now operates a weather station and Nav Canada system.

In 1953, (Central) Fort George Townsite incorporated into the City of Prince George.

On June 25, 1956, at just after 7 p.m., a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter plane built in 1943 (serial number 8300, bearing Canadian registration CF-HSC) flown by Frank Samuel Pynn, out of the Prince George Airport, was observed flying in an unsafe manner, it went into a half roll, seemed to fall over on its back and nosed into a deep ravine in the cut-banks on the north side of town approximately one kilometre from the city centre. Pilot Frank Pynn, a former Royal Air Force Transport Command pilot, and his passenger, 15-year-old Jimmy Clarke, died on impact. Alcohol consumption was believed to be a factor in the crash and the Coroner&#x27;s inquest found that Pynn died &quot;through his own neglect and complete disregard for the Aeronautical Regulations of Canada.&quot; The wreckage is still there; however, most pieces are less than in length.

In 1964 the first pulp mill, Prince George Pulp and Paper was built, followed by two more in 1966, Northwood Pulp and Intercontinental Pulp. New schools and more housing were needed and the new subdivisions of Spruceland, Lakewood, Perry and Highglen were built. Then, in 1975, Prince George amalgamated and extended its borders to include the Hart area to the north, Pineview to the south and the old town of South Fort George to the east.

Low-lying areas adjacent to the confluence of the rivers, which can freeze, mean that those areas suffer recurring flooding. In late 2007 an ice jam formed on the Nechako River and soon grew to a length of more than , causing widespread flooding in the city. Faster runoff due to devastation of nearby lodgepole pine forests by the mountain pine beetle was identified as a contributing factor. A state of emergency was declared on December 11. On January 14, 2008, with the ice jam still present, the Provincial Emergency Program approved an unprecedented plan to melt the ice by piping water from a pulp mill steam plant to the jam area where it would be mixed with well water and poured into the river at a temperature of . In the interim an amphibious excavator was used for 10 days to move some of the ice. Costing C$400,000 to build and C$3,000 per day to run, the &quot;Warm Water System&quot; was completed on January 29, by which time the ice jam had grown to long.

As a result of long-term lobbying from local groups (championed by local advocate Sheldon Clare, and members of 396 Air Cadet Squadron, 2618 Army Cadet Corps, 158 Sea Cadet Corps, 142 Navy League Corps, Branch 43 Royal Canadian Legion, and the Peacekeepers Association) in February 2011, Canadian Armed Forces 39 Canadian Brigade Group Headquarters announced that a detachment of the Rocky Mountain Rangers Army Reserve unit was to be formed in Prince George. In 2014, the Rocky Mountain Rangers increased recruiting efforts in the community to reach platoon and then company size.

Prince George hosted the 2015 Canada Winter Games.

== Geography ==
Prince George is located in the Regional District of Fraser-Fort George near the transition between the northern and southern portions of the Rocky Mountain Trench. Prince George proper contains several areas: South Fort George, the Hart, the residential and light industrial neighbourhoods north of the Nechako River; College Heights, the southern part of the city which contains a mix of residential and commercial areas, and the Bowl, the valley that includes most of the city and the downtown. There are also a number of outlying localities that are also part of Prince George, such as Carlson. The cutbanks of the Nechako River are one of Prince George&#x27;s many interesting geological features.

Local wild edible fruit include bunchberries, rose hips, blueberries, cranberries, chokecherries, strawberries, raspberries, saskatoons, currants, gooseberries, and soapberries (from which &quot;Indian ice cream&quot; is made). Morel mushrooms are also native to this area.

=== Climate ===
The area has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dclo&quot;), but is close to (and once had) a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) as May and September averages are both close to the threshold. Winters are milder than the latitude and elevation might suggest: the January average is , and there are an average of 38 days from December to February where the high reaches or surpasses freezing. Winter months in which Pacific air masses dominate may thaw on a majority of days, as in January 2006 when the mean daily maximum temperature was . On the other hand, Arctic air masses can settle over the city for weeks at a time; in rare cases, such as January 1950, the temperature stays well below freezing over a whole calendar month. Summer days are warm, with a July high of , but lows are often cool, with monthly lows averaging below . The transition between winter and summer, however, is short. There is some precipitation year-round, but February to April is the driest period. At the airport snow averages each year and is heaviest in December and January, usually, but not always, falling between October and May.

One of the highest temperature ever recorded in the Prince George area was on June 28, 2021 at Prince George Massey Auto (). The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 2 January 1950 at Prince George Airport.

=== Sewer and water utilities ===
Prince George&#x27;s drinking water is taken from the Nechako and Fraser Rivers via ten wells. The raw water is disinfected with sodium hypochlorite. The local government treats sewage in a treatment facility in the Lansdowne area, on the west side of the Fraser River, or one of three other smaller treatment facilities on the east side. In the 2014 municipal election, the people of Prince George voted in favour of removing fluoride from their drinking water in a non-binding referendum. Prince George&#x27;s new mayor and city council, at their first meeting, decided to follow the wishes of its voters. Fluoridation of the city&#x27;s water supply ended in December 2014.

=== Air pollution ===
The Prince George airshed has many local sources of various air pollutants including several major industrial sources (pulp mills, sawmills and an oil refinery), vehicle emissions, locomotives, uncovered coal cars, unpaved and paved road surfaces, vegetative burning and residential and commercial heating. Because a large part of the city and its local sources of air pollution are contained within a valley, there are often meteorological conditions that trap pollutants and result in episodes of poor air quality and unhealthy levels of air pollution exposure in some areas.

More people die in Prince George every year due to diseases associated with air pollutants than any other community in the province, according to data gathered by two BC physicians. Although, &quot;Copes said it was difficult to definitively say certain deaths are caused by pollution because it&#x27;s not a factor that is easily recognizable.&quot;

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Prince George had a population of 76,708 living in 31,793 of its 33,643 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 74,003. 
It has a metro census agglomeration population of 89,490. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2001, 23% of households were one-person households, below the 27% average provincewide, and 31% married couples with children, above the 26% average. Prince George had a smaller proportion of married couples than the province, 47% compared to 51%, but very similar persons per households. Only 14% of residents between 20 and 64 years of age completed university, almost half the provincial average, and 22% did not complete high school, similar to the 19% provincial average.

=== Ethnicity ===

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.
=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 census, religious groups in Prince George included:
*Irreligion (44,685 persons or 59.5%)
*Christianity (25,840 persons or 34.4%)
*Sikhism (2,405 persons or 3.2%)
*Hinduism (585 persons or 0.8%)
*Islam (535 persons or 0.7%)
*Buddhism (190 persons or 0.3%)
*Indigenous Spirituality (165 persons or 0.2%)
*Judaism (90 persons or 0.1%)

=== Crime ===
For three consecutive years, from 2010 to 2012, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; named Prince George the most dangerous city in Canada, with its crime rate being 114% above the national average. In 2011, the magazine cited gangs, drug-related crimes, and nine homicides as the reason for its high crime rate, although the magazine did state that the city&#x27;s crime rate is declining each year. In 2016, Prince George was named #4 on the list of the most dangerous cities for violent crime in Canada. In 2023, there were 8 homicides reported in Prince George giving the city a murder rate of 10.4 per 100,000 people. 

== Economy ==
The economy of Prince George in the first decade of the 21st century has come to be dominated by service industries. The Northern Health Authority, centred in Prince George, has a $450 million annual budget and invested more than $100 million in infrastructure. Part of these investments was the 2012 opening of the BC Cancer Agency&#x27;s Centre for the North, which includes for radiation therapy facilities and associated buildings for modern cancer care.

Education is another key dominant part of this city. With the University of Northern British Columbia, the College of New Caledonia and School District #57, education adds more than $780 million into the local economy annually.

Forestry dominated the local economy throughout the 20th century, including plywood manufacture, numerous sawmills and three pulp&amp;pellet mills as major employers and customers. The spruce beetle epidemic of the late 1980s and 1990s resulted in a short term boom in the forest industry as companies rushed to cut dead standing trees before the trees lost value. Sawmill closures (and the creation of &#x27;supermills&#x27;) occurred around 2005, and the largest pellet mill closed in 2022 due to dwindling supply and lack of a sea port.
Mining exploration and development may become the future of Prince George. Initiatives Prince George estimates that the Nechako Basin contains over of oil.

Other industry includes two chemical plants, an oil refinery, brewery, dairy, machine shops, aluminum boat building, log home construction, value added forestry product and specialty equipment manufacturing. Prince George is also a staging centre for mining and prospecting, and a major regional transportation, trade and government hub. Several major retailers are expanding into the Prince George market, a trend expected to persist. In recent years, several market research call centres have opened in Prince George.

Heritage, College Heights, Hart Highlands and St. Lawrence Heights are prime residential areas, both commercial and residential development are growing at an accelerated rate and more subdivisions are planned for St. Lawrence Heights, West Cranbrook Hill and East Austin Road.

== Education ==
Prince George&#x27;s education system encompasses 40 anglophone elementary schools, eight secondary schools, and eight private schools. The anglophone public schools are all part of School District 57 Prince George. It is also home to a public francophone elementary and secondary school, both of which are part of School District 93 Conseil scolaire francophone, a province-wide francophone school district. Post-secondary education choices include the regional College of New Caledonia (CNC), which offers two-year university-transfer courses, plus vocational and professional programs. Several BC universities, British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) and the Open Learning Agency have integrated their local programs with CNC. Prince George is also home to Guardian Aerospace Flight School.

The University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC), established in 1990, is the second-newest university in Canada. A total of 55 undergraduate programs, 27 masters programs and three PhD programs are now offered at UNBC, as well as the new Northern Medical Program, a joint program with the University of British Columbia intended to alleviate the shortage of physicians in the north. A degree-granting institution with regional teaching centres in nine BC communities and a sponsor for several research institutes, UNBC has recently completed the construction of the I.K. Barber Enhanced Forestry Laboratory. UNBC&#x27;s hilltop campus overlooks the City of Prince George and has views of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the east. In 2015 and 2016 UNBC earned the top small university in Canada ranking by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s.&quot; UNBC has consistently been positioned in the top three for the last ten years. The university was first entered into the McLean&#x27;s rankings in 2005 as the best small university in Western Canada.

The College of New Caledonia (CNC) is a post-secondary educational institution that serves the residents of central British Columbia. It was established in Prince George in 1969, and has since expanded across northern British Columbia, with campuses in Quesnel, Mackenzie, Burns Lake, Valemount, Fort St. James, Fraser Lake and Vanderhoof. CNC enrolls about 5,000 students each year in approximately 90 distinct programs in business and management, community and continuing education, health sciences, adult basic education / upgrading, trades and industry, social services, and technologies. About 75 of these programs are available at CNC Prince George. CNC offers university classes leading to degrees and professional programs in more than 50 subjects, with excellent transferability to universities in BC, Alberta, and elsewhere.

=== Art galleries and studios ===
*The Two Rivers Gallery, which opened in June 2000, has two exhibition galleries named the North and South Canfor Galleries, a gift shop and a galleria. It offers guided tours and art classes for both adults and children.
*Studio 2880 houses the Artists&#x27; Workshop, the quilters&#x27;, potters&#x27;, weavers&#x27; and spinners&#x27; guilds. Its sister building, Studio 2820, is a Ticketmaster outlet and houses the Artisan Gift Shoppe.

=== Theatres ===
Prince George Amusement Company opened the 550-seat-capacity Princess Theatre on the corner of Third Ave and Vancouver Street in 1914, which appears distinct from its namesake on Central Ave. The company&#x27;s Rex Theatre opened on George Street that December. The Dreamland Theatre, which relocated to George Street from South Fort George in January 1915, staged some vaudeville, and charity concerts, and accommodated political, religious, and sundry meetings. Movie screenings were irregular prior to a 1918 reopening. Initially, while the Rex primarily screened movies, the Princess was largely vacant when not a venue for opera, charity concerts, and political and sundry meetings. The 1919 relaunch as a movie venue was short lived. The Rex also held wrestling, charity concerts, and political, religious, and sundry meetings.

Levi Graham (1879–1947), who took over the Rex Theatre in 1921, had gained industry experience since 1907. He also operated poolrooms. Further enterprises were movie screenings at select interior towns, refurbishing and managing the Royal Hotel, and operating club establishments.
Al Gardner and Jim Bord briefly managed the Dreamland Theatre in 1922. Acquired by Graham, the Princess Theatre reopened for movies in 1923. That year, Capitol Entertainments of Canada purchased the Dreamland Theatre, and renamed it the Capitol, with Adams remaining as resident manager.
Graham and two partners, operating as Prince George Theatres, acquired the Capitol two years later. Facing insufficient demand, it continued mainly as a venue for live performances and public meetings.

Graham moved the Rex to the corner of Third Avenue and Dominion Street. After gutting and upgrading, it opened in 1926 as the 500-seat Strand Theatre. Condemned as a safety risk, the Capitol was demolished in 1934. Adding a level floor above the existing one in 1935, the Princess served as a dance hall/ballroom, and community centre for indoor sports. After an extensive 1942 upgrade, it returned as a movie theatre. Graham built, briefly operated, and sold the Wells theatre. Selling his two local theatres to Herb G. Stevenson in 1944, Graham devoted his attention to his Six Mile (Tabor) Lake Lodge enterprise.

Odeon Theatres acquired the Strand and Princess in 1969, demolishing the former in 1975. Eighteen months later, the latter suffered the same fate, replaced by a three-screen complex on the site. Cinema Treasures appears reasonably accurate in covering later theatre developments.

==== Live theatre and symphony ====

*The Street Spirits Theatre Company is a Prince George youth-oriented social-action theatre group founded by its Artistic Director Andrew Burton with support from The Youth Around Prince Resource Centre. The group creates and presents audience interactive performances using improv theatre techniques inspired by Theatre of the Oppressed (Augusto Boal) and Theatre for Living (David Diamond) along with many other influences. The group has been running since 1999 and has been given several grants from organizations such as the Vancouver Foundation and awards such as the Otto Rene Castillo Award for Political Theatre and the Canada Peace Medal, among others. The group writes and performs interactive plays about issues affecting communities, such as drug addiction, teen pregnancy and racism and has put out several movies including a feature-length film dealing with northern sex trade recruitment entitled &quot;Streetwise.&quot;

A 2005 cultural project that involved Prince George had &#x27;Spirit Bears&#x27; placed throughout various locations around the city. The &#x27;Spirit Bear&#x27; is a fiberglass statue of a bear that has various sceneries painted on it.

=== Museums and libraries ===

*The Prince George Railway and Forestry Museum opened in July 1986, coinciding with Expo 86 and 150 years of rail travel in Canada. The museum has one of the largest vintage rail collections in the province, including vintage rail cars, locomotives and historical buildings. Most of the museum pieces are located outdoors on the lot. Some historical buildings include a building showing the advancement of the telephone and a building that was once a train stop. There is also old firetrucks and forestry equipment. A mini-train goes around the museum lot.
*The Prince George Public Library has two branches in the city, the Bob Harkins branch in the downtown area, which is considered the &quot;main&quot; library of the city and the smaller Nechako branch in the Hart. The College of New Caledonia and University of Northern British Columbia both have libraries available to local residents.

=== Monuments and art installations ===
Mr. PG was first constructed in 1960 as a symbol of the importance of the forest industry to Prince George. That year he took part in the Prince George May Day parade and could speak and bow. In 1961, he was entered in the Kelowna Regatta and the Vancouver PNE Parade, and also travelled to Smithers. Two years later, he appeared in the 1963 Grey Cup parade.

Today, Mr. PG stands at the junction of Highway 97 and Highway 16. He is tall and his head is in diameter.

== Transportation ==
Located at the intersection of Highways 97 and 16, Prince George is the hub for northern British Columbia. Considerable truck traffic passes through Prince George, which also has extensive facilities for maintenance of trucks and heavy equipment.

The streets in the &quot;Bowl&quot; area of Prince George are laid out in a grid, with streets travelling north–south, and avenues travelling east–west. The streets are named after prominent citizens, and they are placed in alphabetical order, starting with &quot;A&quot; (Alward Street) near downtown, and continuing westward to &quot;R&quot; (Ruggles Street) in the western part of the city. Some avenues in the city are numbered. 1st Avenue is located the northern part of the Bowl, and the numbering increases southward until 22nd Avenue (the highest-numbered avenue in the city).

The grid in the downtown area is rotated so that avenues run from northwest to southeast, and streets run northeast to southwest. All avenues in downtown are numbered, while most of the streets are named after various cities and provinces of Canada.

Many streets in College Heights are named after various colleges and universities. However, College Heights streets are not laid out in a grid like the Bowl. Instead, many roads in College Heights are curved and/or winding, and most are called avenues or crescents.

There is an inland port to Prince Rupert in Prince George which is served by CN Rail.

Prince George Airport, located just within the southern boundary of the city, southeast. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The airport can handle aircraft with up to 30 passengers or 120 if they are unloaded in stages. In 2016, 462,007 passengers used Prince George Airport. The primary air connection to the rest of the world is provided by multiple daily flights to Vancouver International Airport on Air Canada Express and WestJet Encore, and Calgary on WestJet Encore. WestJet provides seasonal service with a weekly direct flight to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico during the winter months. Pacific Coastal Airlines offers a daily flight to and from Victoria International Airport. Central Mountain Air and Northern Thunderbird Air fly to regional and smaller centers. Horizon Air provided daily service to Seattle for a few months in 2008, but the service no longer exists as of 2009. Charter services provide flights to outlying areas primarily by floatplane, though helicopter service is also available. An expansion study to allow the airport to handle Boeing 747 cargo flights was completed. The airport was expanded and is listed as having the third longest runway in Canada but since it was opened in 2009 it has not seen expanded use by any new airlines or 747s other than the test use by one cargo flight.

CNR freight lines operate out of Prince George as well as Via Rail passenger service; the Jasper–Prince Rupert train overnights at the Prince George station.

Local public transportation consists of the PG Transit bus service.

<doc id="197745" wikidata="Q172353" url="?curid=197745" title="Pyrrhus of Epirus">
<text>Pyrrhus ( ; ; 319/318–272 BC) was a Greek king and of the Hellenistic period. He was king of the Molossians, of the royal Aeacid house, and later he became king (Malalas also called him toparch) of Epirus. He was one of the strongest opponents of early Rome, and had been regarded as one of the greatest generals of antiquity. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the phrase &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot; was coined.

Pyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by Cassander four years later. He saw action during the Wars of the Diadochi and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of Ptolemy I Soter. During what came to be known as the Pyrrhic War, Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of Tarentum, scoring costly victories at Heraclea and Asculum. He proceeded to take over Sicily from Carthage but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the Battle of Beneventum in 275 BC.

Pyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from Antigonus II Gonatas in 274 BC and invaded the Peloponnese in 272 BC. The Epirote assault on Sparta was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at Argos.

==Etymology==

The Latinized Pyrrhus derives from the Greek &quot;Pyrrhos&quot; (; ), meaning flame-like or flammable, derived from the word &quot;Pyr&quot; (; ) meaning fire and the suffix &quot;-ros&quot; (; ) meaning -able or &quot;pertaining to&quot;. According to others, the name&#x27;s actual meaning is &quot;fiery, red-coloured&quot;, and was especially used to denote red hair. &quot;Pyrrhos&quot; was also used as an alternate name for Neoptolemus, son of Achilles and the princess Deidamia in Homeric Greek mythology.

==Early life==

In c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince Aeacides of Epirus, and Phthia, a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general Menon. Aeacides was a cousin of Olympias, making Pyrrhus a second cousin to Alexander the Great. He had two sisters: Deidamia and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides&#x27; father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and Neoptolemus.

Aeacides supported Olympias in her fight against Cassander and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides&#x27; support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus&#x27; family fled north and took refuge with Glaucias of the Taulantians, one of the largest Illyrian tribes. Pyrrhus was raised by Beroea, Glaucias&#x27; wife, a Molossian of the Aeacidae dynasty. Cassander marched against Glaucias, defeated his army and captured Apollonia. Glaucias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.

By 313 BC, Cassander was distracted by his war against Antigonus Monophthalmus, one of the most powerful of the Diadochi. Fearing an invasion from Asia Minor, where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.

==First reign==

In 307 BC, Glaucias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus on the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, so his guardians ruled in his stead until he came of age. When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaucias in Illyria to attend the wedding of one of Glaucias&#x27; sons. While he was in Illyria the Molossians rose in rebellion, drove out Pyrrhus&#x27; supporters, and returned Neoptolemus to the throne. This time Glaucias was unable to help him.

==Exile==
Pyrrhus travelled to the Peloponnese and served his brother-in-law Demetrius Poliorcetes who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.

===The Battle of Ipsus===

In 302 BC, Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.

Antigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, Seleucus, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Cassander, had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander&#x27;s armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at Ipsus in Phrygia. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the Wars of the Successors. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Despite these brave efforts, Antigonus lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men, and Pyrrhus continued to serve his brother-in-law as he started rebuilding Antigonus&#x27; empire.

===Ptolemy===
In 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and Ptolemy I Soter. There, he married Ptolemy I&#x27;s stepdaughter Antigone (a daughter of Berenice I of Egypt from her first husband Philip—respectively, Ptolemy I&#x27;s wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 BC, Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.

==Second reign==

Pyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war, he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited Neoptolemus to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to have been unpopular as Epirus&#x27; nobility seem to have been devoted to him.

In 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to Ambracia. In 292 BC, he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius by invading Thessaly while Demetrius was besieging Thebes. Demetrius responded immediately; he left the siege to his son Antigonus Gonatas and marched back north at the head of a large army. Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.

While he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife, Lanassa, daughter of the self-proclaimed king of Sicily Agathocles of Syracuse, deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bear to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to Corcyra with her dowry, offering it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lanassa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus&#x27; allies, the Aetolian League, hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking the Aetolians&#x27; countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to the rescue of his Aetolian allies. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.

Pyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000–25,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius&#x27; army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, and Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus&#x27; bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king&#x27;s victory, the Epirotes resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus&#x27; army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of &#x27;Eagle&#x27; upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus&#x27;s victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.
In 289 BC, Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force, Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.

Demetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father&#x27;s old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet. Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi Lysimachus, Ptolemy, and Seleucus allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus&#x27;s personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.

In 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius&#x27;s Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited until Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought that Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty, because western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near Amphipolis. When the Macedonian army heard that their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus, they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping that his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader rather than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him that they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.

Demetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus by erecting a bust to him and allowing him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.

Pyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia in order to attack Lysimachus&#x27;s Asian domains, Lysimachus requested that Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius&#x27; garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably in order to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids. He quickly defeated Antigonus Gonatas, Demetrius&#x27;s son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus&#x27;s Greek Empire was now at its zenith: he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia, and Thessaly.

In 285 BC, Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying Arsinoe II, the sister of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. He also made a large donation to the Aetolians, Pyrrhus&#x27;s main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC, Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus&#x27;s half of Macedonia with a huge army. Unable to stand against Lysimachus&#x27;s superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded and plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius, &quot;Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual&quot;.

==Struggle with Rome==

The Greek city of Tarentum, in southern Italy, fell out with Rome due to a violation of an old treaty that specified Rome was not to send warships into the Tarentine Gulf. In 282 BC, the Romans installed garrisons in the Greek cities of Thurii (on the western end of the Tarentine Gulf), Locri, and Rhegium, and sent warships to Thurii. Although this was designed as a measure against the Italian peoples of Lucania, the Tarentines grew nervous and attacked the Romans in Thurii, driving the Roman garrison from the city and sinking several Roman warships. Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in Magna Graecia. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans. Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the Oracle of Delphi. He recognized the possibility of carving out an empire for himself in Italy. He made an alliance with Ptolemy Keraunos, King of Macedon and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.
Pyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, 2,000 archers, 500 slingers, and 20 war elephants in a bid to subdue the Romans. The elephants had been loaned to him by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.

Due to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly phalanx infantry, he defeated the Romans, led by Consul Publius Valerius Laevinus, in the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, in the Roman province of Lucania. There are conflicting sources about casualties. Hieronymus of Cardia reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot. Several tribes, including the Lucanians, Bruttii, Messapians, and the Greek cities of Croton and Locri, joined Pyrrhus. He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus tried to wrest Campania from the Romans, but was thwarted in this by the reinforced army of Laevinus. He then boldly marched on Rome itself, but found its defences too formidable. Meanwhile, the Romans had made peace with the Etruscans and had recalled Tiberius Coruncanius, the other consul, who was marching his army southwards from Etruria towards Rome. Pyrrhus now faced three armies; the garrison of Rome, Laevinus from the south and Curuncanius from the north. Not wanting to be caught between three armies Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum, where he wintered his troops.

When Pyrrhus invaded Apulia (279 BC), the two armies met in the Battle of Asculum, where Pyrrhus won a costly victory. The consul Publius Decius Mus was the Roman commander, and while his able force was ultimately defeated, they almost managed to break the back of Pyrrhus&#x27; Epirot army, guaranteeing the security of Rome itself. In the end, the Romans lost 6,000 men and Pyrrhus 3,500 including many officers. Pyrrhus later famously commented on his victory at Asculum, stating, &quot;If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined&quot;. It is from reports of this semi-legendary event that the term Pyrrhic victory originates.

==Ruler of Sicily==
In 278 BC, Pyrrhus received two offers simultaneously. The Greek cities in Sicily asked him to come and drive out Carthage, which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western Mediterranean. At the same time, the Macedonians, whose King Ptolemy Keraunos had been killed by invading Gauls, asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and sailed his army there.

In 278 BC, soon after disembarking his army in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian Siege of Syracuse. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured Eryx, the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.

In 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of Lilybaeum, on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus&#x27; army then began besieging Lilybaeum. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.

These actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the Punic Wars, said to his companions: &quot;What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.&quot; While his army was being transported by ship to mainland Italy, Pyrrhus&#x27; navy was destroyed by the Carthaginians at the Battle of the Strait of Messina, with 98 warships sunk or disabled out of 110.

==Retreat from Italy==

While Pyrrhus had been campaigning against the Carthaginians, the Romans had rebuilt their army by calling up thousands of fresh recruits. Near today&#x27;s Benevento, one of the two Roman Consuls for that year (275 BC), Manius Curius Dentatus, had camped with his men. The other Highness was at that time in Lucania, so Pyrrhus sent against him part of his army, to prevent him from reinforcing Curius, whom Pyrrhus himself was left to deal with. He set out at night in order to reach his enemy secretly. However, the dense vegetation of the area caused problems for his men, who finally arrived at daylight, when they were tired and impossible to pass unnoticed.

As a result the attack was repulsed, with Pyrrhus losing half of his elephants. The next day the Romans took the initiative of the attack. Their initial attack, thanks to the cunning of Pyrrhus and the strong resistance of the Epirotes, failed. However a second wave frightened the elephantspossibly with flaming arrowscausing them to rush against the Epirotes. The latter left the battlefield in disorder, and Pyrrhus had no choice but to withdraw from the battle.

After this inconclusive battle, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. Only the city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.

==Last wars and death==

His western campaign had taken a heavy toll on his army as well as his treasury. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Pyrrhus went to war yet again. The realm of his rival king Antigonus Gonatas of Macedon was the most obvious target. Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the Battle of the Aous and took most of Macedon.

Antigonus managed to hold on to a number of coastal cities. He then waited for an opportunity to reclaim his kingdom while Pyrrhus was already looking for another war to fight. Furthermore, Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.

In 272 BC, Cleonymus, a Spartan of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the Peloponnese for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his assault on Sparta. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son Ptolemy, who had been in command of the rearguard.

Pyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in Argos. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused Battle of Argos in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped. While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier&#x27;s old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him. Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his &quot;Life of Pyrrhus.&quot;

Antigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus&#x27;s death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.

==Legacy==
In his &quot;Life of Pyrrhus&quot;, Plutarch records that Hannibal ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen, though in the &quot;Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus&quot;, Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after Alexander the Great. This latter account is also given by Appian. While he was a mercurial and often restless leader, and not always a wise king, he was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time.

Pyrrhus was known for his benevolence. As a general, Pyrrhus&#x27;s greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries).

The concept of a monarch having a touch that could heal all wounds may have originated with Pyrrhus. As Pliny the Elder states, Pyrrhus&#x27; great toe on his right foot cured diseases of the spleen by merely touching the patient. His toe could also not be burned so when his body was cremated, his toe was put in a coffer, and kept at an unknown temple.

Pyrrhus lends his name to the term &quot;Pyrrhic victory&quot;, which stems from a statement he is alleged to have made following the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: &quot;If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined&quot;. The term Pyrrhic Victory has therefore come to signify a victory that was won at such cost that it loses all worth.

Pyrrhus and his campaign in Italy provided the Greek world with an opportunity to check the advance of Rome further into the Mediterranean. The failure to fully exploit this opportunity while Rome was still only an Italian regional power had immense consequences. The conquest of Magna Graecia by the Romans brought them into direct competition with Carthage, ultimately leading to the First Punic War. Rome&#x27;s victory in this conflict arguably transformed it from a regional power to one of the most powerful states in the Mediterranean. Over the next century the failure of the various Kingdoms and city states of the Hellenistic world to put on a united front against Rome resulted in their absorption into the Roman Empire or, in the case of some, the reduction to the status of a Roman client state. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the Seleucid Empire was forced to cede most of Asia Minor to Rome&#x27;s ally Pergamon (Pergamum). In 133 BC Attalus III, the last King of Pergamon (excluding the pretender Eumenes III), bequeathed the Kingdom and its considerable territories in Asia Minor to Rome in his will. At the destruction of Corinth in 146 BC Rome defeated the city-state of Corinth and its allies in the Achaean League. The league was dissolved and Rome took formal possession of the territoires which constitute modern day Greece, re-organising these territories into province of Macedonia. Finally, in 63 BC, Pompey Magnus delivered the final coup de grace to the already much reduced Seleucid Empire, deposing its last ruler and absorbing its territories into the new Roman province of Syria.

Pyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them, and they received praise from Cicero.

Pyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called Olympias and a son named Ptolemy in honour of her stepfather. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since that was the same year her son was born. His second wife was Lanassa, daughter of King Agathocles of Syracuse (r. 317–289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had a son, Alexander. His third wife was the daughter of Audoleon, King of Paeonia. His fourth wife was the Illyrian princess Bircenna, who was the daughter of King Bardylis II,(r. c. 295–290 BC) who bore Pyrrhus&#x27; youngest son, Helenus. His fifth wife was the daughter of Ptolemy Keraunos, whom he married in 281/280 BC.

<text>Henry Reed (22 February 1914 – 8 December 1986) was a British poet, translator, radio dramatist, and journalist.

==Life and work==
Reed was born in Birmingham and educated at King Edward VI School, Aston, followed by the University of Birmingham. At university he associated with W. H. Auden, Louis MacNeice and Walter Allen. He went on to study for an MA and then worked as a teacher and journalist. He was called up to the Army in 1941, spending most of the war as a Japanese translator. Although he had studied French and Italian at university and taught himself Greek at school, Reed did not take to Japanese, perhaps because he had learned an almost entirely military vocabulary. Walter Allen, in his autobiography &quot;As I Walked down New Grub Street,&quot; said Reed intended &quot;to devote every day for the rest of his life to forgetting another word of Japanese.&quot;

After the war he worked for the BBC as a radio broadcaster, translator and playwright, where his most memorable set of productions was the &quot;Hilda Tablet&quot; series in the 1950s, produced by Douglas Cleverdon. The series started with &quot;A Very Great Man Indeed&quot;, which purported to be a documentary about the research for a biography of a dead poet and novelist called Richard Shewin. This drew in part on Reed&#x27;s own experience of researching a biography of the novelist Thomas Hardy. However, the &#x27;twelve-tone composeress&#x27; Hilda Tablet, a friend of Richard Shewin, became the most interesting character in the play; and in the next play, she persuades the biographer to change the subject of the biography to her – telling him &quot;not more than twelve volumes&quot;. Dame Hilda, as she later became, was based partly on Ethel Smyth and partly on Elisabeth Lutyens (who was not pleased, and considered legal action).

Reed&#x27;s most famous poetry is in &quot;Lessons of the War&quot;, originally three poems which are witty parodies of British army basic training during World War II, which suffered from a lack of equipment at that time. Originally published in &quot;New Statesman and Nation&quot; (August 1942), the series was later published in &quot;A Map of Verona&quot; in 1946, which was his only collection published in his lifetime. &quot;Naming of Parts&quot;, the first poem in &quot;Lessons of the War&quot;, was also taught in schools. Three further poems have subsequently been added to the set. Another often-anthologised poem is &quot;Chard Whitlow: Mr. Eliot&#x27;s Sunday Evening Postscript&quot;, a satire of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Burnt Norton&quot;. Eliot himself was amused by &quot;Chard Whitlow&quot;&#x27;s mournful imitations of his poetic style (&quot;As we get older we do not get any younger ...&quot;).

Reed made a radio programme, reading all of &quot;Lessons of the War&quot;, which was broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s Third Programme on 14 February 1966.

He was often confused with the poet and critic Herbert Read (1893–1968); the two men were unrelated. Reed responded to this confusion by naming his &#x27;alter ego&#x27; biographer in the &quot;Hilda Tablet&quot; plays &quot;Herbert Reeve&quot; and then by having everyone get the name slightly wrong.

The Papers of Henry Reed are kept in the University of Birmingham Library Special Collections.

<text>The Chevin is the ridge on the south side of Wharfedale in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, overlooking the market town of Otley, and often known as Otley Chevin.

==Etymology==
The name is Brythonic in origin, the earliest attestation of the name in English is an eleventh-century copy of a charter from 972 which gives the spelling as &quot;Scefinc&quot;, with another charter of around 1030 records it as &quot;on Scefinge&quot;. These early spellings suggest that an originally Celtic term (related to the Modern Welsh &quot;is y cefn&quot;, meaning below the ridge) was borrowed into English, as the initial &quot;s-&quot; likely indicates the name was preceded by a word unfamiliar to speakers of Old English.

As such, the word &quot;Chevin&quot; simply means &quot;back&quot;, &quot;ridge&quot; or &quot;ridge of high land&quot;, and shares its etymology with many other hills across western Europe, such as The Cheviot in Northumberland, Cefn Cribwr and Cefn Bryn in Glamorgan and the Cévennes in France. One of the steep hillsides of the Chevin is called the &quot;Great Dib&quot;, first attested in 1290 as &quot;Dibe&quot;. Since &quot;dib&quot; is a Middle English word for &#x27;pool&#x27;, this name probably originally referred to a pool at the foot of the slope.

==History and features==

The Chevin is largely covered in attractive old woodland and heathland. It is a part of the Carboniferous Millstone Grit group. A Roman road ran along the top of the Chevin, part of the road that linked Eboracum (York), Calcaria (Tadcaster) and Olicana (Ilkley), perhaps on the same route as the modern road, Yorkgate, or perhaps about to the south.

The highest point of the Chevin is often thought to be &quot;Surprise View&quot;, however it is in fact Beacon Hill next to Yorkgate quarry which reaches at and used to be the site of a trig point. Surprise View is the more visited summit of the Chevin and offers extensive views of Otley and Wharfedale, and has an adjacent car park. It is the site of a cross erected every Easter since 1969.

Parts of the Chevin, known as the Danefield Estate, belonged to landowner Walter Fawkes and his descendants. After World War II these areas were donated to Otley Urban District Council as a memorial to those from the Wharfe Valley who had lost their lives during the war.

==Recreation==
Several outcrops of rock are distributed across the upper slopes of the Chevin and are popular for climbing and bouldering. The Chevin also has a number of footpaths and bridlepaths, and is popular with walkers, runners and riders. It is crossed by the Leeds link to the Dales Way, and the Ebor Way. There is also an Orienteering course in the forest park, with maps available from the local tourist office. Chevin Forest parkrun takes place at 9am every Saturday morning - it is a free, weekly, timed, 5 km run, organised by local volunteers. As a recreational area, the Chevin is divided in two by the East Chevin Road.

==The Chevin in art==
The famous painting &quot;Snow Storm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alps&quot; by J. M. W. Turner which hangs in the Tate Gallery, is reputed to have been inspired by a view of the Chevin with a stormy background sky. Turner used to stay with his friend Walter Fawkes at Farnley Hall on the opposite side of the valley to the Chevin. Recalling a day in the autumn of 1810 Fawkes&#x27; son, Hawkesworth, remembered a storm that inspired one of Turner&#x27;s major paintings:

:&quot;Hawkey! Hawkey! Come here! Come here! Look at this thunder-storm. Isn&#x27;t it grand? isn&#x27;t it wonderful? – isn&#x27;t it sublime?&quot; All this time he was making notes of its form and colour on the back of a letter. I proposed some better drawing-block, but he said it did very well. He was absorbed – he was entranced. There was the storm rolling and sweeping and shafting out its lightning over the Yorkshire hills. Presently the storm passed and he finished. &quot;There Hawkey,&quot; said he, &quot;In two years you will see this again, and call it Hannibal Crossing the Alps.&quot;
Otley indie rock band The Chevin take their name from the hill.

<doc id="197754" wikidata="Q741007" url="?curid=197754" title="Joe Meek">
<text>Robert George&quot;Joe&quot;Meek (5 April 1929 – 3 February 1967) was an English record producer and songwriter considered one of the most influential sound engineers of all time, being one of the first to develop ideas such as the recording studio as an instrument, and becoming one of the first producers to be recognised for his individual identity as an artist. Meek pioneered space age and experimental pop music, and assisted in the development of recording practices like overdubbing, sampling and reverberation.

Charting singles Meek produced for other artists include &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot; (John Leyton, 1961), &quot;Just Like Eddie&quot; (Heinz, 1963), &quot;Angela Jones&quot; (Michael Cox, 1960), &quot;Have I the Right?&quot; (the Honeycombs, 1964), and &quot;Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot; (Mike Berry, 1961).

The Tornados&#x27; instrumental &quot;Telstar&quot; (1962), written and produced by Meek, became the first record by a British rock group to reach number one in the US Hot 100. It also spent five weeks at number one in the UK singles chart, with Meek receiving an Ivor Novello Award for this production as the &quot;Best-Selling A-Side&quot; of 1962.

He also produced music for films such as &quot;Live It Up!&quot; (US title &quot;Sing and Swing&quot;, 1963), a pop music film. Meek&#x27;s concept album &quot;I Hear a New World&quot; (1960), which contains innovative use of electronic sounds, was not fully released in his lifetime.

Meek was affected by bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. His commercial success as a producer was short-lived, and he gradually sank into debt and depression. On 3 February 1967, using a shotgun owned by musician Heinz Burt, Meek killed his landlady, Violet Shenton, with whom he had argued over the loudness of his studio, which he rented from her, and then shot himself.

At the time of his death, Meek possessed thousands of unreleased recordings later dubbed &quot;The Tea Chest Tapes&quot;. His reputation for experiments in recording music was acknowledged by the Music Producers Guild who in 2009 created &quot;The Joe Meek Award for Innovation in Production&quot; as a &quot;homage to [the] remarkable producer&#x27;s pioneering spirit&quot;. In 2014, Meek was ranked the greatest producer of all time by &quot;NME&quot;, elaborating: &quot;Meek was a complete trailblazer, attempting endless new ideas in his search for the perfect sound. ... The legacy of his endless experimentation is writ large over most of your favourite music today.&quot;

==Childhood and early interests==
Meek was born at 1 Market Square, Newent, Gloucestershire, and developed an interest in electronics and performance art at a very early age, filling his parents&#x27; garden shed with begged and borrowed electronic components, building circuits, radios and what is believed to be the region&#x27;s first working television. During his national service in the Royal Air Force, he worked as a radar technician which increased his interest in electronics and outer space. From 1953 he worked for the Midlands Electricity Board. He used the resources of the company to develop his interest in electronics and music production, including acquiring a disc cutter and producing his first record.

==Music career==
He left the electricity board to work as an audio engineer for a leading independent radio production company which made programmes for Radio Luxembourg, and made his breakthrough with his work on Ivy Benson&#x27;s &quot;Music for Lonely Lovers&quot;.

His technical ingenuity was first shown on the Humphrey Lyttelton jazz single &quot;Bad Penny Blues&quot; (Parlophone Records, 1956) when, contrary to Lyttelton&#x27;s wishes, Meek modified the sound of the piano and compressed the sound to a greater than normal extent. The record became a hit.

===Lansdowne Studios===
He then put enormous effort into Denis Preston&#x27;s Landsdowne Studio but tensions between Preston and Meek soon saw Meek leaving. During his time he recorded US actor George Chakiris for SAGA Records and it was this that led him to Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and an independent career. He also engineered many jazz and calypso records including vocalist and percussionist Frank Holder and band leader Kenny Graham.

Meek was also working as a songwriter at this time, using the name &quot;Robert Duke&quot;. After being initially released by Eddie Silver and later by Tommy Steele, the Duke composition &quot;Put A Ring On My Finger&quot; was recorded by Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford in 1958, and reached #32 on the US charts.

===Triumph Records===
In January 1960, together with William Barrington-Coupe, Meek founded Triumph Records. At the time Barrington-Coupe was working at SAGA records in Empire Yard, Holloway Road for Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks and it was the Major who provided the finance. The label very nearly had a No.1 hit with Meek&#x27;s production of &quot;Angela Jones&quot; by Michael Cox. Cox was one of the featured singers on Jack Good&#x27;s TV music show &quot;Boy Meets Girls&quot; and the song was given massive promotion. As an independent label, Triumph was dependent on small pressing plants, which were unable to meet the demand for product. The record made a respectable appearance in the Top Ten, but it demonstrated that Meek needed the distribution network of the major companies for his records to reach retail outlets.

Its indifferent business results and Meek&#x27;s temperament eventually led to the label&#x27;s demise. Meek later licensed many Triumph recordings to labels such as Top Rank and Pye. That year Meek conceived, wrote and produced an &quot;Outer Space Music Fantasy&quot; album titled &quot;I Hear a New World&quot; with a band called Rod Freeman &amp; the Blue Men. The album was shelved for decades, apart from the release of some EP tracks taken from it.

===304 Holloway Road Studio===

Meek went on to set up his own production company known as RGM Sound Ltd (later Meeksville Sound Ltd) with toy importer Major Wilfred Alonzo Banks as his financial backer. He operated from his home studio which he constructed at 304 Holloway Road, Islington, a three-floor flat above a leather-goods store.

His first hit from Holloway Road reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart: John Leyton&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Remember Me&quot; (1961) written by Geoff Goddard. This &quot;death ditty&quot; was cleverly promoted by Leyton&#x27;s manager, expatriate Australian entrepreneur Robert Stigwood. Stigwood was able to gain Leyton a booking to perform the song several times in an episode of &quot;Harpers West One&quot;, a short-lived ITV soap opera in which he was making a guest appearance.

The instrumental &quot;Telstar&quot;, written and produced by Meek, was recorded at the Holloway Road studio in July 1962. It was released in August 1962 and reached No. 1 in the UK and on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in December 1962.

Meek&#x27;s third UK No. 1 and last major success was with the Honeycombs&#x27; &quot;Have I the Right?&quot; in 1964, written by Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley. The Meek-produced track also became a number 5 hit on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts. The success of these recordings was instrumental in establishing Stigwood and Meek as two of Britain&#x27;s first independent record producers.

When his landlady, Violet Shenton, who lived downstairs, felt that the noise was too much, she would bang on the ceiling with a broom. Meek would signal his contempt by placing loudspeakers in the stairwell and turning up the volume.

A privately manufactured &quot;black plaque&quot; (designed to resemble the official blue plaque) has since been placed at the location of the studio to commemorate Meek&#x27;s life and work.

==Artistry==
Meek was one of the first producers to grasp and fully exploit the possibilities of the modern recording studio. Up to that time, pop recordings sought to &quot;capture a live performance&quot; by recording all the performers &quot;live in a studio&quot;, often situated around just a few microphones. Instead, Meek pioneered multiple over-dubbing on one- and two-track machines to combine separately recorded performances, segments, and even samples, into a painstakingly constructed composite recording, long before the Beatles made some of these techniques famous with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) or extended by Pink Floyd with &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973).

By physically separating instruments, and using close miking, he could avoid &quot;bleed&quot;, such as drum sounds appearing in vocal tracks, which freed him up to combine signals from different &quot;takes&quot;, and allowed him to manipulate their individual signals.

He pioneered signal processing by using direct input units on bass guitars, and treating instruments and voices with echo, reverb and compression, or his fabled home-made electronic devices. At a time when studio engineers limited themselves to maintaining clarity and fidelity, Meek was never afraid to distort or manipulate the sound if it created the effect he was seeking.

Unlike other producers, his search was for the &#x27;right&#x27; sound rather than for a catchy musical tune, and throughout his brief career he single-mindedly followed his quest to create a unique &quot;sonic signature&quot; for every record he produced.

==Personal life==
Meek became fascinated with the idea of communicating with the dead, after reading the works about EVP of Friedrich Jurgenson (1903–1987) and Konstantins Raudive (1909–1974). He would set up tape machines in graveyards in an attempt to record voices from beyond the grave, in one instance capturing the meows of a cat he believed was speaking in human tones, asking for help. In particular, he had an obsession with Buddy Holly (saying the late American rocker had communicated with him in dreams). By the end of his career, Meek&#x27;s fascination with these topics had taken over his life following the deterioration in his mental health, and he started to believe that his flat contained poltergeists, that aliens were substituting his speech by controlling his mind, and that photographs in his studio were trying to communicate with him.

===Mental health===
Meek was affected by bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and, upon receiving an apparently innocent phone call from American record producer Phil Spector, Meek immediately accused Spector of stealing his ideas before hanging up angrily. His professional efforts were often hindered by his paranoia (Meek was convinced that Decca Records would put hidden microphones behind his wallpaper to steal his ideas), depression, and extreme mood swings. In later years, Meek started experiencing psychotic delusions, culminating in his refusal to use the studio telephone for important communications due to his belief that his landlady was eavesdropping on his calls through the chimney, that he could control the minds of others with his recording equipment, and that he could monitor his acts while away from the studio through supernatural means.

Meek was also a frequent recreational drug user, with his barbiturate abuse further worsening his depressive episodes. In addition, his heavy consumption of amphetamines caused him to fly into volatile rages with little or no provocation, at one point leading him to hold a gun to the head of drummer Mitch Mitchell to &#x27;inspire&#x27; a high-quality performance.

===Sexual orientation===
Meek&#x27;s homosexuality – at a time when homosexual acts were illegal in the UK – put him under further pressure and he was particularly afraid that his mother would find out about his sexual orientation. In 1963 he was convicted and fined £15 () for &quot;importuning for immoral purposes&quot; in a London public toilet, and was consequently subject to blackmail. In January 1967, police in Tattingstone, Suffolk, discovered two suitcases containing the remains of Bernard Oliver. According to some accounts, Meek was afraid of being questioned by the Metropolitan Police, as it was known they were intending to interview all of the gay men in London. This was enough for him to lose his self-control.

===Decline===
Meek always walked everywhere outside the studio wearing sunglasses, fearing recognition by local gangsters such as the Kray twins, whom he feared would attempt to steal his acts or blackmail him regarding his homosexuality.

Meek&#x27;s depression deepened as his financial position became increasingly desperate. French composer Jean Ledrut accused him of plagiarism, claiming that the melody of &quot;Telstar&quot; had been copied from &quot;La Marche d&#x27;Austerlitz&quot;, a piece from a score Ledrut had written for the film &quot;Austerlitz&quot; (1960). The lawsuit meant that Meek did not receive royalties from the record during his lifetime, and the issue was not resolved in his favour until three weeks after his death in 1967.

===Murder and suicide===
On 3 February 1967 (the eighth anniversary of Buddy Holly&#x27;s death), Meek killed his landlady Violet Shenton and then himself, at his Holloway Road residence. The weapon used was a single-barrelled shotgun which he had confiscated from his protégé, former Tornados bassist Heinz Burt. Meek and Shenton had argued over his noise levels and the rent that he still owed, before Meek picked up the gun. Burt had informed Meek that he had used the gun to shoot birds while on tour, at which point Meek had taken it. Meek had kept the gun under his bed, along with some cartridges. As the gun owner, Burt was questioned intensively by police before being eliminated from their enquiries. Meek was buried at Newent Cemetery, Newent, Gloucestershire.

===Recording===
Meek&#x27;s inability to play a musical instrument or write notation did not prevent him writing and producing successful commercial recordings. For songwriting, he was reliant on musicians such as Dave Adams, Geoff Goddard or Charles Blackwell to transcribe melodies from his vocal demos. He worked on 245 singles, 45 of which reached the top fifty.

In 1993, former session singer Ted Fletcher introduced the &quot;Joemeek&quot; line of audio processing equipment. The tribute to Meek was due to his influence in the early stages of audio compression. The name and product line were sold to the American company PMI Audio Group in 2003. The current product line includes a microphone series called &quot;Telstar&quot;, named after Meek&#x27;s biggest hit.

===&quot;The Tea Chest Tapes&quot;===

After Meek&#x27;s suicide, Cliff Cooper of the Millionaires is said to have purchased the thousands of recordings Meek had hidden at his studio, for £300 ().. These recordings were called the &quot;Tea Chest Tapes&quot; among fans, as they had been stored in tea chests in Meek&#x27;s flat. Alan Blackburn, former president of the Joe Meek Appreciation Society, catalogued all of them in the mid-1980s, but they remained unreleased.

On 4 September 2008, these unreleased recordings were auctioned in Fame Bureau&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s More Than Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot; auction. They were reportedly sold for £200,000 but, in a 2021 interview for the BBC, Cooper states that they had failed to sell on that occasion. They contained over 4,000 hours of music on approximately 1,850 tapes, including recordings by David Bowie as singer and sax player with the Konrads, Gene Vincent, Denny Laine, Billy Fury, Tom Jones, Jimmy Page, Mike Berry, John Leyton, Ritchie Blackmore, Jess Conrad, Mitch Mitchell and Screaming Lord Sutch. The tapes also contained many examples of Meek composing songs and experimental sound techniques. Tape 418 has Meek composing songs for the film &quot;Live It Up!&quot;

On 2 September 2020, Cherry Red Records announced that they had purchased the tapes from Cooper and would begin the process of digitising the archive with a view to releasing the material, subject to rights clearance. The first release was &quot;The Telstar Story&quot; in 2022, and the series has since run to a dozen volumes.

===Artists produced by Meek===
In 1963 Meek worked with a then little-known singer Tom Jones, then the lead vocalist of Tommy Scott &amp; the Senators. Meek recorded seven tracks with Jones and took them to various labels in an attempt to get a record deal, with no success. Two years later after Jones&#x27; worldwide hit &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; in 1965, Meek was able to sell the tapes he had recorded with Jones to Tower (US) and Columbia (UK).

===Charted singles===
The following Meek productions appeared on the British charts.

===Biographies===
In later years, the interest in Meek&#x27;s life as well as influence on the music industry, has spawned at least two documentary films, a radio play, a stage play and a feature film.
* On 8 February 1991, the BBC showed a 60-minute documentary in its &quot;Arena&quot; documentary series, entitled &quot;The Very Strange Story of... the Legendary Joe Meek&quot;. The BBC has since repeated the documentary several times.
* On 26 March 1994, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;Lonely Joe&quot;, a radio play based on the life of Meek, written by Janey Praeger and Peter Kavanagh.

===Tributes and references===

A number of artists have made tributes to Meek in various ways:
* Franco-English pop singer-songwriter MeeK chose his stage name as a homage to the British producer.
* British punk Wreckless Eric recounts Meek&#x27;s life and recreates some of his studio effects in his song &quot;Joe Meek&quot; from the album &quot;Donovan of Trash&quot;.
* The Marked Men, a Texas punk band, have a song titled &quot;Someday&quot; with lyric: &quot;Joe Meek wanted all the world to know about the news he found.&quot;
* The Frank Black song &quot;White Noise Maker&quot; deals with Meek&#x27;s suicide by shotgun, the white noise maker of the title. &quot;It&#x27;s been so long since my Telstar.&quot;
* Matmos, an Electronic duo, have a song on their 2006 album &quot;The Rose Has Teeth in the Mouth of the Beast&quot; called &quot;Solo Buttons for Joe Meek&quot;.
* In 1995, the record label Razor &amp; Tie released the compilation album &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Believe It: The Amazing World of Joe Meek&quot;, consisting of twenty songs Meek had produced.
* Swing Out Sister include a short instrumental named &quot;Joe Meek&#x27;s Cat&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Shapes and Patterns&quot;, inspired by Meek&#x27;s 1966 ghost-hunting expeditions to Warley Lea Farm during which he allegedly captured recordings of a talking cat channelling the spirit of a former landowner who committed suicide at the farm.
* Graham Parker&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Burning Questions&quot; includes the cryptic &quot;Just Like Joe Meek&#x27;s Blues&quot;
* Sheryl Crow claimed that her song &quot;A Change Would Do You Good&quot; was inspired by an article she read about Meek.
* Jonathan King recorded a song in 2007 about Meek Titled &quot;He Stood in the Bath He Stamped on the Floor&quot;.
* Johnny Stage, Danish producer and guitarist released an album in tribute of Meek, entitled &quot;The Lady with the Crying Eyes&quot; featuring various Danish artists, on 3 February 2007.
* Dave Stewart (the keyboardist) and Barbara Gaskin recorded the song &quot;Your Lucky Star&quot; dealing with the life and death of Meek, released on the 1991 album &quot;Spin&quot;. Dave Stewart also recorded a version of &quot;Telstar&quot; on the occasion of its 40th anniversary in 2002. This was later released on the Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin 2009 mini-album &quot;Hour Moon&quot;. The album also features the duo&#x27;s previously released Meek tribute &quot;Your Lucky Star&quot; from their 1991 album &quot;Spin&quot;.
* The Spanish label &quot;Spicnic&quot; released in 2001 a tribute CD, &quot;Oigo un nuevo no mundo. Homenaje a Joe Meek&quot;, featuring various Spanish bands.
* Trey Spruance, from the band Mr. Bungle, has stated that the ten-part song/instrumental &quot;The Bends&quot; from their album &quot;Disco Volante&quot; is inspired by Joe Meek&#x27;s music. Specifically &quot;I Hear a New World&quot;.
* The Coral&#x27;s British Top 10 hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Think You&#x27;re the One&quot; (2003) is a musical homage to Meek.
* Thomas Truax regularly performed his Meek tribute &quot;Joe Meek Warns Buddy Holly&quot; on his 2008 tours, a song apparently about Meek&#x27;s supposed warning via spirit-writing predicting Buddy Holly&#x27;s death. A single and accompanying video was scheduled for release on 3 February 2009, the 50th anniversary of Holly&#x27;s demise, also the date of Meek&#x27;s suicide.
* Robb Shenton released &quot;Lonely Joe&quot; as a tribute to the producer on 28 October 2008. Shenton was one of Meek&#x27;s artists and was with five Meek bands between 1963 and early 1966: The Bobcats, David John and the Mood, the Prestons, the Nashpool and Flip and the Dateliners. He also sang backing vocals with many others.
* In 2004 and 2006 respectively, UK record label Western Star records put together and released two volumes of Meek tributes on CD. These compilations were made up of Western Star artists all paying tribute by recording songs originally recorded or written by Meek. Then in 2012, producer, label boss and long time Meek enthusiast Alan Wilson released &quot;Holloway Road&quot;, a song about Meek. This featured on the album &quot;Infamy&quot;, by his own band The Sharks.
* In 2005, Cane 141 released a B-Side called &quot;Joe Meek Shall Inherit The Earth&quot;. The name is a pun on Joe Meek&#x27;s name and the Bible verse Matthew 5:5 where Jesus (during the Sermon on the Mount) is quoted as saying &quot;Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.&quot;
* Deadbeat Poets recorded &quot;Staircase Stomp&quot; in 2010; the title is a reference to the Honeycombs song &quot;Have I the Right?&quot;, and the song has many references to Meek.
* Jasper Marsalis, of the music performance piece Slauson Malone 1, performed a cover of Meek&#x27;s &quot;I Hear a New World&quot; on his 2023 album &quot;EXCELSIOR&quot; and at live performances preceding its release. Marsalis credits the original song with inspiring him to continue his music career during the making of &quot;EXCELSIOR&quot;, stating the following during a Bandcamp online listening party: &quot;Originally this album was only supposed to be two songs and after that I was going to stop making music then my friend Rahill played me the song ‘I Hear A New World’ by Joe Meek. I just felt so inspired by listening to it. I wanted to do a cover to learn how the song was made and it inspired me to develop an entire album around this one song.&quot;

<doc id="197757" wikidata="Q1669008" url="?curid=197757" title="USS Tuscaloosa (CA-37)">
<text>USS &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; (CL/CA-37) was a of the U.S. Navy. Commissioned in 1934, she spent most of her career in the Atlantic and Caribbean, participating in several European wartime operations. In early 1945, she transferred to the Pacific and assisted in shore bombardment of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. She earned 7 battle stars for her service in World War II. Never damaged in battle, the ship fared better compared to her six sister ships, three of which were sunk and the other three heavily damaged.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; was decommissioned in early 1946 and scrapped in 1959.

==Construction and commissioning==
The keel was laid down on 3 September 1931 at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Shipbuilding Co., and the hull was launched on 15 November 1933, sponsored by Mrs. Jeanette McCann, the wife of Lieutenant Thomas L. McCann and the niece of William Bacon Oliver, the Representative of Alabama&#x27;s 6th congressional district). She was commissioned on 17 August 1934, Captain John N. Ferguson in command.

The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers.&quot; Originally classified a light cruiser before she was laid down, because of her thin armor, she was reclassified a heavy cruiser, because of her 8-inch guns. The term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; devoted the autumn to a shakedown cruise which took her to Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo, before she returned to the New York Navy Yard shortly before Christmas. She then underwent post-shakedown repairs which kept her in the yard into March 1935.

The heavy cruiser soon shaped a course for the west coast. After a stop at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, she transited the Panama Canal on 7–8 April and then steamed north to San Diego, where she joined Cruiser Division 6 (CruDiv 6) in time to participate in Fleet Problem XVI staged in May in the northern Pacific off the coast of Alaska and in waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands. This operation was divided into five distinct phases which might be aspects of some real naval campaign of the future in which the United States would take the strategic offensive.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; subsequently was based at San Pedro, California, whence she conducted routine exercises and local operations with CruDiv 6. In the spring of 1936, the heavy cruiser participated in Fleet Problem XVII, taking place off the west coast of the United States, Central America, and the Panama Canal Zone. The five phase exercise was devoted to preparing the fleet for antisubmarine operations, testing communications systems, and training of aircraft patrol squadrons for extended fleet operations.

In May 1937, the Fleet again exercised in Alaskan waters and in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands and Midway, practicing the tactics of seizing advanced base sites - a technique later to be polished to a high degree into close support and amphibious warfare doctrines. &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, as part of the &quot;augmented&quot; Scouting Force, &quot;battled&quot; the Battle Force that spring.

In April and May 1938, the heavy cruiser participated in Fleet Problem XIX, which was conducted in the vicinity of Hawaii.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; departed San Diego on 3 January 1939 and proceeded, via the Panama Canal, to the Caribbean. She took part in Fleet Problem XX, in the Atlantic to the east of the Lesser Antilles, before undergoing a brief refit at the Norfolk Navy Yard. She then joined and for a goodwill tour of South American ports. From 8 April to 10 May, the division—under the command of Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel—visited Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, and Buenos Aires before transiting the storm-tossed Strait of Magellan. The three cruisers drove their bows deep into heavy seas and battled gale-force winds as they made the difficult passage on 14–15 May. The division then sailed up the west coast of South America, visiting Valparaíso, Chile, and Callao, Peru, before transiting the Panama Canal and returning to Norfolk, where she arrived on 6 June.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; remained off the east coast into the summer of 1939. In August, she carried President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Campobello Island, New Brunswick. &quot;En route&quot;, off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, the Commander in Chief witnessed salvage operations in progress on the sunken which had stayed down after a test dive on 24 May. On 24 August, following visits to Campobello and several ports in Newfoundland, President Roosevelt disembarked at Sandy Hook on the coast of New Jersey.

==Before Pearl Harbor==

===September 1939 – November 1939===
The outbreak of World War II a week later (1 September 1939) found &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; at NOB Norfolk. On the 5th, President Roosevelt established the Neutrality Patrol; and, the next day, the cruiser departed for her first patrol, which kept her at sea until she returned to her home port on the 11th. Three days later, the heavy cruiser departed Norfolk and spent the remainder of September and most of October engaged in gunnery training and conducting exercises out of Guantanamo Bay and San Juan, Puerto Rico. She departed the Caribbean on 27 October, bound for Hampton Roads, and arrived at Norfolk on 5 November and, but for gunnery exercises off the Virginia Capes from 13 to 15 November, remained in the Hampton Roads areas until mid-December.

Meanwhile, the Neutrality Patrol found itself keeping track of German merchantmen in waters of the western hemisphere. At the outbreak of hostilities, there had been some 85 German ships near the Americas. One of those, the North German (&quot;Norddeutsche&quot;) Lloyd (NDL) liner —the 13th largest steamship in the world—had been on a tourist cruise when war caught her in the West Indies. She put into Veracruz, Mexico, where she fueled and prepared to make a break for home.

===December 1939===
The liner departed Veracruz on 14 December 1939 but soon thereafter was escorted by seven destroyers, including the . Captain Willibald Dahne, the master of the &quot;Columbus&quot;, was careful to keep his ship within the neutrality zone until she was abreast of the Delaware capes. He then headed east. The &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, meanwhile, had been ordered out to participate. On 16 December, two days after &quot;Columbus&quot; departed Veracruz, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; stood out of Norfolk, bound for her patrol station. She soon relieved and —two flushdeckers— at 0600 on 18 December. On 19 December, the liner spotted the British destroyer , who sent a warning shot and then a flash signal, &quot;You are captured.&quot;

For Captain Dahne, there remained only one alternative. After having carefully planned for that eventuality, he scuttled his ship. All but two of his crew of 578 succeeded in going over the side and manning the lifeboats. The &quot;Hyperion&quot; clearly had no room for all of the Germans. The &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; radioed the &quot;Hyperion&quot;, &quot;Our orders, either you take all or none. We are warning, stay away from the boats. If you ram or sink one, we will have to commence firing at you.&quot;

From his motor launch, Captain Dahne kept the lifeboats together while the &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; embarked the 576 men, boys and women. He then followed them to safety on board the cruiser which provided hospitality for the shipwrecked mariners who were glad to be on board an American cruiser as rescued seamen and not in a British warship as prisoners-of-war. The bulk of the survivors were put up in the cruiser&#x27;s seaplane hangar that had been cleared out to facilitate its use as a large berthing area; and the women were berthed in sick bay.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; took the survivors to New York—the only port equipped to handle such a large and sudden influx of aliens—and disembarked them at Ellis Island between 1610 and 1730 on 20 December for officials to process. Ultimately, most of &quot;Columbus&quot; officers and men returned, via the Pacific, to their native land. Meanwhile, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; departed New York on the 21st and arrived at Norfolk the following day.

===January 1940 – November 1940===
The heavy cruiser remained at Norfolk into the New Year, 1940, and departed her home port on 11 January bound for the West Indies. On the voyage to the Caribbean, she was accompanied by her sister ship &quot;San Francisco&quot;; Battleship Division 5—less and , the prototype high-speed transport. &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and her consorts arrived at Culebra on the 16th, and two days later shifted to Guantánamo Bay. There, she participated in fleet exercises from the 18th to the 27th. Departing Guantánamo on the latter day, the &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; returned to Norfolk on 29 January and entered the navy yard there for special alterations to fit her out for service as presidential flagship.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; departed from the Norfolk Navy Yard on 2 February, and then she moored at NOB Norfolk. Two days later, she got under way for Cuba, arriving at Guantánamo on the 7th, only to steam out three days later for Pensacola, Florida, in company with . The two ships exercised en route and arrived at Pensacola on the 14th.

On the next day, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; embarked President Roosevelt and his guests and departed in company with and &quot;Lang&quot; for a cruise to Panama and the west coast of Central America. The voyage gave the President an opportunity to discuss Pan American defense with leaders of Latin American nations. Steaming to the Pacific coast of Central America, Roosevelt inspected the Pacific defenses of the Panama Canal. In addition, he fished regularly at a variety of locations but, as he later recounted, caught &quot;damned few fish.&quot; On the return passage through the canal, on 27 February, Roosevelt conferred with United States Navy, Army, and Air Corps officers to discuss the defense of the vital passage.

After disembarking the President at Pensacola, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; proceeded north to Norfolk and from thence to the New York Navy Yard for a three-month overhaul. During her sojourn at Brooklyn, Hitler&#x27;s legions conquered France in June 1940 and won mastery of continental Europe. Soon thereafter, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; returned to the neutrality patrol and conducted monotonous but intensive patrols in the Caribbean and Bermuda areas through the summer and fall months of 1940.

===December 1940 – April 1941===
On 3 December 1940 at Miami, President Roosevelt embarked in &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; for the third time for a cruise to inspect the base sites obtained from Britain in the recently negotiated &quot;destroyers for bases&quot; deal. In that transaction, the United States had traded 50 old flush-deck destroyers for 99-year leases on bases in the western hemisphere. Ports of call included Kingston, Jamaica; Santa Lucia, Antigua; and the Bahamas. Roosevelt fished and entertained British colonial officials—including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor—on board the cruiser.

While the President cruised in &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, American officials in Washington wrestled with the problem of extending aid to Britain. Having barely weathered the disastrous campaign in France in the spring and the Battle of Britain in the summer, the United Kingdom desperately needed materiel. American production could meet Britain&#x27;s need, but American neutrality law limiting the purchase of arms by belligerents to &quot;cash-and-carry&quot; transactions was about to become a major obstacle, for British coffers were almost empty. While pondering Britain&#x27;s plight as he luxuriated in &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, the President hit upon the idea of the Lend-Lease program to aid the embattled British.

On 16 December, Roosevelt left the ship at Charleston, South Carolina, to head for Washington to implement his &quot;lend-lease&quot; idea—one more step in United States&#x27; progress towards full involvement in the war. Soon thereafter, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; sailed for Norfolk and, on 22 December, embarked Admiral William D. Leahy, the newly designated Ambassador to Vichy France, and his wife, for passage to Portugal. With the &quot;stars and stripes&quot; painted large on the roofs of Turrets II and III, and her largest colors flying, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; sailed for the European war zone, initially escorted by and .

After disembarking the Ambassador to Vichy France at Lisbon and returning to Norfolk on 11 January 1941, the cruiser went to sea on maneuvers that kept her at sea until 2 March. She subsequently arrived at the newly opened American naval facility at Bermuda, on 8 April, the day after the base&#x27;s commissioning. Her consorts included , , , and . Based at Bermuda, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; continued patrolling shipping lanes in the North Atlantic, enforcing the neutrality of the United States.

===May 1941 – August 1941===
Elsewhere in the Atlantic, the war between the British and the Germans took an anxious turn late in May when the German battleship and the cruiser broke out into the Atlantic. On 24 May, &quot;Bismarck&quot; had sunk the vaunted in the Denmark Strait and had temporarily eluded pursuit.

&quot;Bismarck&quot;″s escape into the swirling mists of the Atlantic prompted orders which sent &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; to sea immediately. Most of the crew on liberty at the time could not be rounded up in time, so the ship set out for the hunt with personnel &quot;shanghaied&quot; from and &quot;Quincy&quot; and a group of reserve ensigns who happened to be on board for a reserve cruise. However, before the cruiser reached waters where she hoped to find &quot;Bismarck&quot;, British warships—directed under legally questionable circumstances by an American naval reserve ensign piloting a British PBY—succeeded in torpedoing &quot;Bismarck&quot; which had to be scuttled by her own crew after the damage caused a rudder jam and loss of her main guns.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; soon returned to the tedium, the tenor of events soon changed for the heavy cruiser. On 8 August, she departed Bermuda for Newfoundland and soon embarked General Henry H. Arnold, head of the Army Air Corps; Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner, Director of the War Plans Division of the Navy; and Capt. Forrest Sherman. She joined off New York City; and, together, the two ships, escorted by a screen of three destroyers proceeded to NS Argentia, Newfoundland.

&quot;Augusta&quot;, bearing President Roosevelt, and her consorts soon arrived in the barren anchorage where the British battleship —with Prime Minister Winston Churchill embarked—awaited her. The ensuing discussions between the two heads of state hammered out the &quot;Atlantic Charter&quot;.

===September 1941 – October 1941===
Returning from Argentia upon the conclusion of the Anglo-American talks, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; conveyed Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles to Portland, Maine. Three weeks later, in September, the cruiser overtook the first American troop convoy to Iceland, as American marines relieved British troops guarding that strategic island.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; soon received new orders which assigned her to a task group built around battleships , , and . &quot;Wichita&quot; and two divisions of destroyers joined &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; in the screen of the men of-war. Under the two-starred flag of Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, the Denmark Strait patrol worked out of wind-swept, cold Hvalfjörður, Iceland—nicknamed by the American sailors and Marines as &quot;Valley Forge&quot;.

The similarities between the Continental Army&#x27;s historic winter campground and the Icelandic region were not just confined to a homonymous relation of their names. The bitter cold, wind, and snow and the wartime operations seemed similar—the latter in the form of daily patrols, unceasingly vigilant for any signs of the &quot;enemy&quot;. &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and &quot;Wichita&quot; &quot;stripped ship&quot; for war, removing accumulated coats of paint, interior and exterior, floor tiling, and other inflammable and nonessential items before they set out for sea on 5 November. As the task force steamed toward Iceland, its warships were constantly alert to the possibility of an imminent sortie by the German battleship , the sister ship of the sunken &quot;Bismarck&quot;.

While &quot;Tirpitz&quot; refused to show herself, the American ships continued to conduct &quot;short of war&quot; operations against German shipping and naval forces which became increasingly warlike as time went on. The attempted torpedoing of the destroyer , the damaging of the &quot;Kearny&quot; in October; the sinking of by a German U-boat; and the torpedoing of the oiler all pointed to the fact that American ships were becoming involved in the war.

==The Bombing of Pearl Harbor and War for the United States==

===December 1941 – April 1942===
The Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s attack at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, plunged the United States into a real war at last, in both oceans, because both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States on 11 December.

In his speech to the Reichstag declaring war on the United States, Adolf Hitler described the presence of &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; at the scuttling of the &quot;Columbus&quot; two years prior as a hostile act against the German nation, insisting that it had forced the liner &quot;into the hands of British warships&quot;. As such, Hitler listed the &quot;Columbus&quot; operation among the casus belli for his declaration of war.

On 6 January 1942, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; steamed out of Hvalfjörður along with &quot;Wichita&quot; and two American destroyers— and —for a training mission through the Denmark Strait. After returning to port three days later, the heavy cruiser moved on to Boston for a navy yard overhaul from 8–20 February. She conducted refresher training out of Casco Bay and then underwent another brief refit at New York Harbor before joining Task Group 39.1 (TG 39.1), under the command of Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox, Jr., whose flag flew from the new battleship .

TG 39.1 sortied from Casco Bay and then it struggled through the gale-whipped seas of the North Atlantic Ocean, bound for Scapa Flow, Scotland, in the Orkney Islands—the main base for the British Home Fleet. On 27 March, Rear Admiral Wilcox apparently suffered a coronary and then was washed overboard from &quot;Washington&quot;. (Some have speculated that the admiral might have jumped overboard to commit suicide, but there was no prior evidence at all that this might happen.) The heavy seas ruled out rescue attempts, and the task group&#x27;s commanding officer soon disappeared in the stormy Atlantic. With Admiral Wilcox&#x27;s death, Rear Admiral Giffen, whose two-starred flag flew from &quot;Wichita&quot;, assumed command of TG 39.1.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; arrived at Scapa Flow on 4 April and she immediately took on board a British signals and liaison team. She was initially employed with the British Home Fleet on training duties and later took part in covering runs for convoys to northern Russia.

===June 1942 – October 1942===
At that period, Anglo-American naval operations frequently were mounted in an attempt to lure &quot;Tirpitz&quot; out of her snowy Norwegian lair. One such attempt, Convoy PQ 17, resulted in disaster in June 1942. The following two months found &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; still active in convoy covering and escorting assignments.

In mid-August, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; received orders to carry supplies—including aircraft torpedoes, army ammunition, and medical equipment—to Northern Russia, via the Arctic Ocean. Soon after she and two destroyers set out on the mission, a member of the cruiser&#x27;s crew developed symptoms of spinal meningitis. The sick man was quickly put ashore at Seyðisfjörður, Iceland, and the group got underway again on 19 August, bound for Kola Inlet.

On the next day, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and her screening warships—which by that time consisted of three destroyers (two American and one British)—were spotted by a snooping German reconnaissance plane. The task force changed course and, assisted by the worsening visibility in the northern latitudes, managed to shake the intruder. On the evening of 22 August, two more British destroyers joined &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s screen; and, the following day, a Russian escort guided them to Kola Inlet.

All hands turned-to and unloaded the valuable cargo. The cruiser then took on fuel; prepared to get underway; and, just before departure, embarked 243 passengers, most of whom were survivors of ships which had been sunk while serving in earlier convoys to Russia. Many of them had endured the special tribulation and agony of the PQ 17. With her human cargo thus on board, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; cleared Kola Inlet on 24 August and then she reached Seidisfjord on the 28th.

She remained there but briefly before steaming to the mouth of the River Clyde, where she disembarked her passengers. Detached from the Home Fleet shortly thereafter, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; headed back to Hvalfjord and then proceeded thence to the East Coast of the United States for a many-weeks-long overhaul.

===November 1942 – May 1943===
On 8 November 1942, Operation Torch—the code name of the Anglo-American effort to conquer Northwestern Africa from the Vichy French and Nazi Germany, and thence to expel the Axis Powers from Africa—got under way.

Off Casablanca, French Morocco, the heavy cruisers &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and &quot;Wichita&quot; joined the new American battleship , the aircraft carrier &quot;Ranger&quot; and numerous light cruisers and destroyers as the &quot;big guns&quot; for the segment of Operation Torch in Morocco. (Other forces invaded Algeria via the Mediterranean Sea.) As American troops waded ashore, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s powerful 8-inch, 55-calibre guns, aided by accurate spotting from the cruiser&#x27;s scout planes, thundered loudly and sent high explosive shells flying shorewards into the French Army&#x27;s defensive positions. In the harbor, French Navy warships scurried about as they prepared to sortie against the attackers.

The unfinished and immobile French Navy battleship , could still throw a powerful punch from her few completed naval guns, and she fired several relatively accurate salvoes, straddling the American warships several times with shell splashes. (The French did not have any fire control radars at that time, or for years later.) The French Army&#x27;s shore batteries at Table d&#x27;Aukasha and El Hank also proved to be troublesome. However, the combined might of the American warships and naval air power silenced both the shore batteries and the big guns of &quot;Jean Bart&quot;, and demolished several French Air Force airfields.

After being narrowly missed by several torpedoes from Vichy French submarine &quot;Antiope&quot; and shells from &quot;Jean Bart&quot;″s heavy artillery, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; retired from the battle scene to refuel at sea and to replenish her ammunition in deeper waters farther offshore. After these laborious operations, she remained offshore in support of the invasion and then she headed back to the East Coast of the United States for a major shipyard and replenishment at a large naval base.

Following this overhaul, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; rejoined the mission covering convoys bound for North Africa via the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, while American, British, Free French troops and airmen pushed the Axis Armies and the Vichy French forces out of Morocco and Algeria, and following that, cornering them in northern Tunisia around the city of Tunis. At that point, all of the Axis troops in Tunisia surrendered to the Allies in early May 1943, and thus the Axis powers were expelled from Africa.

Meanwhile, from March through May 1943, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; steamed in a task force on training exercises off the east coast of the United States.

Besides honing its fighting edge, this group formed a fast, mobile, and ready striking force, should German surface ships slip through the Allied blockade to terrorize Allied shipping in the Atlantic. In late May, she escorted , which bore British Prime Minister Churchill to New York City. After rejoining the task force for a brief time, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; joined &quot;Augusta&quot; at the Boston Navy Yard for a 10-day work period.

===Summer 1943 - October 1943===
After leaving Boston, she escorted to Halifax, Nova Scotia, before rendezvousing with &quot;Ranger&quot; and proceeding to Scapa Flow to resume operations with the British Home Fleet. &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; conducted sorties into the North Sea, in company with British and American units, in attempts to once again entice German heavy units to sea. However, the hope of drawing the Germans into a decisive sea fight diminished each passing day as the enemy apparently sought to stay in his protected waters.

On 2 October 1943, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; formed part of the covering force for &quot;Ranger&quot; while the carrier launched air strikes against port installations and German shipping at the seaport town of Bodø, Norway, in Operation Leader.

These were the first-ever US Navy naval aviation air raids against any European targets, and they lasted from 2–6 October 1943. These raids reportedly devastated shore facilities and Wehrmacht forces in the Bodø area. German Luftwaffe shore-based warplanes attempted to attack the strike forces from &quot;Ranger&quot;, but they were shot down by covering American fighters.

Shortly afterward, the Germans did elect to come out to sea, conducting a foray against the important Allied weather station on Spitzbergen. &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and other heavy units subjected the installation and its garrison to a severe shelling before retiring, unscathed, to their Norwegian lair.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; took part in the relief expedition to reestablish the station before the onset of winter. Assigned to Force One, the cruiser loaded two LCV(P) and cargo and departed Seidisfjord in company with four destroyers—three British and one American—on 17 October. Force Two, covering Force One, consisted of the battleship , the heavy cruiser , the carrier &quot;Ranger&quot;, and six destroyers.

On the morning of the 19th, &quot;Tuscaloosa&#x27;s&quot; group arrived at devastated Barentsburg and immediately commenced unloading operations. While ice &quot;growlers&quot; and pinnacles hampered antisubmarine screening by the destroyers&#x27; sound gear, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; fielded a party of 160 men on shore to unload supplies and equipment to reestablish the weather station. By nightfall, the cargo had been safely unloaded, and the force left the area. After fueling at Seidisfjord, the cruiser proceeded to the Clyde to disembark the survivors of the original Spitzbergen garrison.

===December 1943 – May 1944===
&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; conducted one more sweep of the Norwegian coast in an attempt to draw German fleet units to sea, but the enemy chose not to give battle. Upon the cruiser&#x27;s return to Iceland, she was detached from the Home Fleet and proceeded to New York where she began major overhaul on 3 December 1943.

Upon completion of the refit in February 1944, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; engaged in Fleet exercises and shore bombardment practice out of Casco Bay until April and then entered the Boston Navy Yard for installation of radio intelligence and electronic countermeasures gear. Later that month, she embarked Rear Admiral Morton L. Deyo, Commander, CruDiv 7, and task force commander, and set out for the Clyde to join the Allied Forces massing for the assault on the European continent.

During the interim period prior to D-Day, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; conducted further shore bombardment practice and engaged in further exercises. Her aviation unit exchanged its venerable Curtiss SOC Seagulls for British Supermarine Spitfires and checked them out for spotting purposes. However, they remained shore-based for the remainder of their time operating in support of the invasion.

===June 1944 – July 1944===
On 3 June, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; steamed in company with the rest of Task Force 125 (TF 125) bound for the Normandy beaches. At 0550, 6 June, she opened fire with her battery, and three minutes later her guns engaged Fort Ile de Tatihou, Baie de la Seine. For the remainder of D-Day, coast defense batteries, artillery positions, troop concentrations, and motor transport all came under the fire of &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s guns, which were aided by her air spotters and by fire control parties attached to Army units on shore. VOS-7, a US Navy Spotter Squadron flying Supermarine Spitfire VBs and Seafire IIIs, was one of the units which provided targeting coordinates and fire control. Initial enemy return fire was inaccurate, but it improved enough by the middle of the day to force the cruiser to take evasive action.

On the afternoon of 9 June, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; returned to Plymouth to replenish her depleted ammunition. Back in the vicinity of the Îles Saint-Marcouf on the evening of the 11th, she remained on station in the fire-support area until 21 June, providing gunfire support on call from her shore fire control party operating with Army units. She then returned to Britain.

Five days later, on 26 June, the Army&#x27;s VII Corps mounted a landward assault against Cherbourg, supported by ships of the covering force from the seaward side. For four hours, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and her consorts dueled with the accurate German shore batteries. During the action, the enemy frequently straddled the British and American ships and forced them to take evasive action. Great clouds of smoke and dust, kicked up by the intense bombardment conducted from sea and land, initially hampered Allied fire. By noontime, however, visibility improved and greatly aided the accuracy of the bombardment.

In July, with the beachhead secured in Normandy and Allied forces pushing into occupied France, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; steamed from Belfast to the Mediterranean to join British, French, and American forces assembling for Operation Anvil-Dragoon, the invasion of southern France.

===August 1944 – January 1945===
Following preliminary bombardment exercises off Oran, French North Africa, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; was based at Palermo, Italy, and got underway on 13 August. Two days later, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; commenced fire at 0635 and continued to pound targets ashore until the combined Allied forces stormed onto the beaches at H-Hour, 0800. Then, moving off the 100 fathom (180 m) curve, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; leisurely cruised the shoreline, visually inspecting it for targets of opportunity. A troublesome pillbox at the St. Raphel breakwater provoked &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s attention, and the cruiser&#x27;s shells soon destroyed it. Air spotters located a field battery, and &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s gunners promptly knocked it out of action with three direct hits.

For the next 11 days, the cruiser delivered fire support for the right flank of the Army&#x27;s advance to the Italian frontier. She engaged German shore batteries and fought off air attacks. The raids—conducted by Junkers Ju 88s and Dornier Do 217s singly, or in small groups—usually occurred during the covering force&#x27;s nightly retirement from the beachheads. Of the high altitude variety, these aerial assaults included the use of radar-controlled glider bombs. However, radar counter-measures and jamming devices, as well as effective evasive action and gunfire, thwarted these twilight and nocturnal attacks.

In September, when Allied forces had secured footholds in both western and southern France, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; returned to the United States for refitting at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. After a short exercise period in Chesapeake Bay, she steamed via the Panama Canal to the west coast and reported to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet. After stopping briefly at San Diego, she proceeded on westward to Pearl Harbor, where she conducted various exercises before steaming to Ulithi to join Commander, 3rd Fleet in January 1945.

===February 1945 – August 1945===

Following her sortie from Ulithi, she joined the bombardment group off Iwo Jima at dawn on 16 February. Three days later, as waves of landing craft bore marines shoreward to invade the island, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s guns pounded Japanese positions inland. Then, after the Americans had reached land, her batteries supported their advances with incessant fire and illumination. This continued from 19 February to 14 March, throughout all phases of the bitterly fought campaign to wrest the island from the Japanese.

After the Iwo Jima operation, she returned to Ulithi to join Task Force 54 (TF 54), spending four hectic days replenishing stores, ammunition, and fuel in preparation for the next operation: Okinawa, at the end of the chain of the Japanese home islands. On Palm Sunday, 25 March, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s main and secondary batteries opened fire on shore targets pinpointed by aerial reconnaissance. Time considerations only allowed a six-day respite in the middle of the arduous campaign for replenishment purposes, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; stood on duty for the entire operation.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s charmed life in the face of everything the Axis could throw at her still held through the maelstrom of the &quot;kamikazes&quot; which came at the invasion ships and their escorts from all quarters. The &quot;Divine Wind&quot; came down from the Japanese home islands, in the form of planes piloted by pilots so loyal to their Emperor that they unhesitatingly gave their lives to defend their home soil.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;″s gunners splashed two of the intruders. One, headed for the fantail of , flew apart as the cruiser&#x27;s shells splashed her in the old battleship&#x27;s wake. The other headed for an escorting destroyer in the screen only to be splashed after hitting a curtain of fire from the cruiser&#x27;s guns.

Only the mop-up of determined resistance ashore remained when &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; departed from Okinawa on 28 June. Two days later, she arrived in Leyte Gulf, Philippine Islands; there reporting to Commander, 7th Fleet, for duty. Six weeks later, with Allied warships bombarding her shores with near impunity and Allied planes sweeping her skies clear of rapidly dwindling numbers of her defending aircraft, Japan surrendered.

On 27 August, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, in company with other units of the 7th Fleet, departed Subic Bay in the Philippines, bound for Korean and Manchurian waters.

==Post-war==
She touched at Qingdao, China, &quot;en route&quot;, and proceeded to cruise off the newly liberated ports of Dalian and Port Arthur, Manchuria; Yantai, Taku, Weihaiwei and Qingdao, China, before finally anchoring off Jinsen (now Incheon), Korea on 8 September to support the landings of Marines nearby.

After a stay of 22 days, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; put to sea once more on 30 September, bound for Taku, China, to support Marines landing there. She next sailed for Yantai on 6 October but, &quot;en route&quot;, received orders changing her destination to Jinsen to take on provisions.

As Chinese Nationalist and Communist forces jockeyed for position to control formerly Japanese-held territory, American forces stood by in the uneasy role of observers. &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; arrived off Yantai, then held by the Communists, on 13 October. Remaining until 3 November, she lay at anchor off the port, keeping well informed on the situation ashore through daily conferences with officials of the Communist Eighth Route Army. During this period, collaborationist troops who had been loyal to the Japanese during the war, clashed with Communist forces near Yantai.

On 3 November, she put to sea, bound for Qingdao, where the cruiser spent one evening before proceeding down the Chinese coast to call at Shanghai. There, she took on board 214 army and 118 navy passengers for &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; transportation home for demobilization.

She arrived in Hawaii on 26 November, where additional passenger facilities were installed, and took on board 206 more men before departing Hawaiian waters on the 28th and arriving at San Francisco on 4 December. After voyage repairs, the ship sailed for the South Pacific on 14 December, via the Solomon Islands, and proceeded to Nouméa, New Caledonia.

&quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; embarked troops at Guadalcanal, moved to the Russell Islands where she took on more passengers, and arrived at Nouméa on New Year&#x27;s Day 1946. By that afternoon, the ship got underway for the west coast with more than 500 passengers.

She arrived at Pearl Harbor nine days into the new year, fueled, and picked up additional demobilized servicemen to transport home. She sailed for San Francisco on 10 January and arrived five days later. On 29 January, the men delivered, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; stood out of San Francisco bound for the east coast on her last cruise as an active member of the fleet.

Placed out of commission at Philadelphia on 13 February 1946, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; remained in reserve there until she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959. Her hulk was sold on 25 June to the Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

The ship&#x27;s former mast is the centerpiece of the Tuscaloosa Veterans Memorial Park, which also features one of her five-inch guns.

<text>Pinot noir (), also known as Pinot nero, is a red-wine grape variety of the species &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;. The name also refers to wines created predominantly from Pinot noir grapes. The name is derived from the French words for &quot;pine&quot; and &quot;black.&quot; The word &quot;pine&quot; alludes to the grape variety having tightly clustered, pinecone—shaped bunches of fruit.

Pinot noir is grown around the world, mostly in cooler climates, and the variety is chiefly associated with the Burgundy region of France. Pinot noir is now used to make red wines around the world, as well as champagne, sparkling white wines such as the Italian Franciacorta, and English sparkling wines. Regions that have gained a reputation for red Pinot noir wines include the Willamette Valley of Oregon; the Carneros, Central Coast, Sonoma Coast, and Russian River AVAs of California; the Elgin and Walker Bay wine regions of South Africa; the Mornington Peninsula, Adelaide Hills, Great Southern, Tasmania, and Yarra Valley in Australia; and the Central Otago, Martinborough, and Marlborough wine regions of New Zealand. Pinot noir is the most planted varietal (38%) used in sparkling wine production in Champagne and other wine regions.

Pinot noir is a difficult variety to cultivate and transform into wine. The grape&#x27;s tendency to produce tightly packed clusters makes it susceptible to several viticultural hazards involving rot that require diligent canopy management.

The thin skins and low levels of phenolic compounds lend pinot to producing mostly lightly colored, medium-bodied and low-tannin wines that can often go through phases of uneven and unpredictable aging. When young, wines made from Pinot noir tend to have red fruit aromas of cherries, raspberries, and strawberries. As the wine ages, Pinot has the potential to develop more vegetal and &quot;barnyard&quot; aromas that can contribute to the complexity of the wine.
==Description==
Pinot noir&#x27;s home is France&#x27;s Burgundy region, particularly Côte-d&#x27;Or. It is also planted in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, northern parts of Croatia, Czech Republic, England, the Republic of Georgia, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Hungary, Albania, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Moldova, New Zealand, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland, Ukraine, United States, and Uruguay. The United States has increasingly become a major Pinot noir producer, with some of the best regarded coming from Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley, and California&#x27;s Sonoma County with its Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast appellations. Lesser-known appellations are found in Mendocino County&#x27;s Anderson Valley, the Central Coast&#x27;s Santa Lucia Highlands appellation, the Santa Maria Valley, and Sta. Rita Hills American Viticulture Area in Santa Barbara County. In New Zealand, it is principally grown in Martinborough, Marlborough, Waipara, and Central Otago.

The leaves of Pinot noir are generally smaller than those of Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah. The vine is typically less vigorous than either of these varieties. The grape cluster is small and conico-cylindrical, shaped like a pinecone. Some viticultural historians believe this shape similarity may have given rise to the name. In the vineyard, Pinot noir is sensitive to wind and frost, cropping levels (it must be low yielding for the production of quality wines), soil types, and pruning techniques. In the winery, it is sensitive to fermentation methods and yeast strains and is highly reflective of its &quot;terroir,&quot; with different regions producing very different wines. Its thin skin makes it susceptible to bunch rot and similar fungal diseases. The vines themselves are susceptible to powdery mildew, especially in Burgundy infection by leaf roll, and fanleaf viruses cause significant vine health problems. These complications have given the grape a reputation for being difficult to grow: Jancis Robinson calls pinot a &quot;minx of a vine&quot; and André Tchelistcheff declared that &quot;God made cabernet sauvignon whereas the devil made Pinot noir&quot;. It is much less tolerant of harsh vineyard conditions than the likes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot or Grenache.

However, Pinot noir wines are among the most popular in the world. Joel L. Fleishman of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; describes them as &quot;the most romantic of wines, with so voluptuous a perfume, so sweet an edge, and so powerful a punch that, like falling in love, they make the blood run hot and the soul wax embarrassingly poetic&quot;. Master Sommelier Madeline Triffon calls them &quot;sex in a glass&quot;.

The tremendously broad range of bouquets, flavors, textures, and impressions that Pinot noir can produce sometimes confuses tasters. Broadly, the wines tend to be of light to medium body with an aroma reminiscent of black and/or red cherry, raspberry and to a lesser extent currant and many other fine small red and black berry fruits. Traditional red Burgundy is famous for its savory fleshiness and &quot;farmyard&quot; aromas (this latter is sometimes associated with thiol and other reductive characters), but changing fashions, modern winemaking techniques, and new easier-to-grow clones have favored a lighter, more fruit-prominent, cleaner style.

The wine&#x27;s color, when young, is often compared to that of garnet, frequently being much lighter than that of other red wines. This is entirely natural and not a winemaking fault, as Pinot noir has a lower skin anthocyanin (coloring matter) content than most other classical red/black varieties. Callistephin, the 3-&quot;O&quot;-glucoside of pelargonidin, an orange-colored anthocyanidin, is also found in the berry skins of Pinot noir.

However, an emerging, increasingly evident style from California and New Zealand highlights a more powerful, fruit-forward, and darker wine that can tend toward Syrah (or even new world Malbec) in depth, extract, and alcoholic content.

Pinot noir is also used in the production of Champagne (usually along with Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier) and is planted in most of the world&#x27;s wine-growing regions for use in both still and sparkling wines. Pinot noir grown for dry table wines is generally low-yielding and of lesser vigor than many other varieties, whereas when grown for use in sparkling wines (e.g., Champagne), it is generally cropped at significantly higher yields.

In addition to being used for the production of sparkling and still red wine, Pinot noir is also sometimes used for rosé still wines, Beaujolais Nouveau-styled wines, and even vin gris white wines. Its juice is uncolored.

==History, mutants and clones==

Pinot noir is almost certainly a very ancient variety that may be only one or two generations removed from wild Vitis sylvestris vines. Its origins are nevertheless unclear: In &quot;De re rustica&quot;, Columella describes a grape variety similar to Pinot noir in Burgundy during the 1st century CE; however, vines have grown wild as far north as Belgium in the days before phylloxera, and it is possible that pinot represents a direct domestication of (hermaphrodite-flowered) &quot;Vitis sylvestris&quot;.

Ferdinand Regner argued that Pinot noir is a cross between Pinot Meunier (Schwarzriesling) and Traminer, but this claim has since been refuted. In fact, Pinot Meunier has been shown to be a chimerical mutation (in the epidermal cells) which makes the shoot tips and leaves prominently hairy-white and the vine a little smaller and early ripening. Thus, Pinot Meunier is a chimera with two tissue layers of different genetic makeup, both of which contain a mutation making them non-identical to, and mutations of, Pinot noir (as well as of any of the other color forms of pinot). As such, Pinot Meunier cannot be a parent of Pinot noir, and, indeed, it seems likely that chimerical mutations which can generate Pinot gris from other pinot (principally blanc or noir) may in turn, be the genetic pathway for the emergence of Pinot Meunier.

Pinot gris is a pinot color sport (and can arise by mutation of Pinot noir or Pinot blanc), presumably representing a somatic mutation in either the VvMYBA1 or VvMYBA2 genes that control grape berry color. Pinot blanc is a further mutation and can either naturally arise from or give rise to Pinot gris or Pinot noir; the mutation-reversion path is multi-directional, therefore. The general DNA profiles of both Pinot gris and blanc are identical to Pinot noir; and other Pinots, Pinot mour, and Pinot teinturier are also genetically similarly close. Almost any given Pinot (of whatever berry color) can occur as a complete mutation or as a chimera of almost any other pinot. As such, suggestions that Pinot noir is the fundamental and original form of the Pinots are both misleading and highly tendentious. Indeed, if anything, Pinot blanc may be the original human-selected form of Pinot, although given the genetic variability of this longstanding genetic line, thinking of Pinot as a familial cluster of grapes sharing a fundamental and common genetic core is almost certainly nearest the truth. It is this core around which the sub-varietally identifying color variations (blanc, rouge, noir, gris, rose, violet, tenteurier, moure, etc.) occur, along with the more striking chimeric morphological mutation that is Pinot Meunier, and the interesting further mutations of this variety as Pinot Meunier gris and as the non-hairy mutation which the Germans classify as &#x27;Samtrot&#x27; (effectively &#x27;Pinot red velvet&#x27;).
A white berried sport of Pinot noir was propagated in 1936 by Henri Gouges of Burgundy, and there is now 2.5ha planted of this grape which Clive Coates calls Pinot Gouges, and others call Pinot Musigny. There is, however, no published evidence, nor any obvious reason, to believe that this is other than a (possibly quite fine) form of Pinot blanc, having simply arisen as a selected natural mutation of the original Pinot noir in the Gouges&#x27; vineyard.

In the UK, the name &#x27;Wrotham Pinot&#x27; is a permitted synonym for Pinot Meunier and stems from a vine that one of the pioneers of UK viticulture, Edward Hyams, discovered in Wrotham (pronounced &#x27;root-am&#x27; or &#x27;root-em&#x27;) in Kent in the late 1940s. It was, in all probability, the variety known as &#x27;Miller&#x27;s Burgundy,&#x27; which had been widely grown on walls and in gardens in Great Britain for many years. Archibald Barron writing in his book, &quot;Vines and Vine Culture&quot;, the standard Victorian work on grape growing in the UK, states that the &#x27;Millers Burgundy&#x27; also was &quot;found by&quot; [the famous horticulturalist] &quot;Sir Joseph Banks in the remains of an ancient vineyard at Tortworth, Gloucestershire – a county well known for its medieval vineyards&quot;. Hyams took the vine to Raymond Barrington Brock, who ran what was to become the Oxted Viticultural Research Station, and he trialed it alongside the many other varieties he grew. Brock said that when compared to supplies of Meunier from France, Wrotham Pinot: had a higher natural sugar content and ripened two weeks earlier. Hyams, ever the journalist in search of a good story, claimed that this vine had been left behind by the Romans, although he provided absolutely no evidence for this. Brock sold cuttings of &#x27;Wrotham Pinot,&#x27; and the variety became quite popular in early English &quot;revival&quot; vineyards in the late twentieth century, although it is unlikely that many vines from the cuttings supplied by Brock survive in any present UK vineyards. Indeed, despite the fact that today virtually all plantings of Meunier in the UK stem from French and German nurseries, the name Wrotham Pinot is still a legally acceptable synonym for this variety, although little, if ever, used by UK growers.

Pinot noir can be particularly prone to mutation (suggesting it has active transposable elements), and thanks to its long history in cultivation, there are hundreds of different clones in vineyards and vine collections worldwide. More than 50 are officially recognized in France compared to only 25 of the much more widely planted Cabernet Sauvignon. The French Etablissement National Technique pour l&#x27;Amelioration de la Viticulture (ENTAV) has set up a program to select the best clones of Pinot. This program has succeeded in increasing the number of quality clones available to growers. In the new world, particularly in Oregon, wines of extraordinary quality continue to be made from the (ex-University of California at Davis) Pommard (principally UCD4) and Wadensvil (UCD 1A and/or 2A) clones.

Gamay Beaujolais is a Californian misnomer for a UCD clone series of upright-growing (&#x27;Pinot Droit&#x27;) Pinot noir. Planted mostly in California it also became established in New Zealand. In New Zealand, its disposition to poor fruit set in cool-flowering conditions can be problematic. It has been claimed that the &#x27;Gamay Beaujolais&#x27; Pinot noir was brought to California by Paul Masson. But it was collected in France by Harold Olmo for UCD in the 1950s and was one of the first Pinot Noir vines this institution offered as a high-health clonal line from about 1962 onward. However, it was misleadingly identified at UCD as a &#x27;Gamay Beaujolais&#x27; type (of Pinot noir). In general, these upright growing &#x27;Pinot Droit&#x27; clones are highly productive (in suitable, hot-to-warm, flowering conditions) and in California and New Zealand, they give robust, burly wines favored by those who like muscle rather than charm and velvety finesse in their Pinot noir wines. In Burgundy, the use of (highly productive) Pinot Droit clones is reportedly still widespread in inferior, Village appellation, or even non-appellation vineyards, and Pinot Droit is consequently regarded, arguably with very good reason, as a (genetic) sub-form significantly inferior to classical, decumbent, &#x27;Pinot fine&#x27; or &#x27;Pinot tordu&#x27;, clonal lines of Pinot.

Frühburgunder (Pinot Noir Précoce) is an early-ripening form of Pinot noir. Across the Pinot family, ripening in typical climates can be dispersed by as much as four, and even six weeks between the very earliest (including Précoce) clones and the very latest ripening. Virus infection and excessive cropping significantly add to the delaying of Pinot noir ripening.

Gouget noir is sometimes confused as being a clone of Pinot noir but, DNA analysis has confirmed that it is a distinct variety.

In August 2007, a consortium of researchers, announced the sequencing of the genome of Pinot noir. It is the first fruit crop to be sequenced, and only the fourth flowering plant.

==Crosses==

In the Middle Ages, the nobility and church of northeast France grew some form of Pinot in favored plots, while peasants grew a large amount of the much more productive, but otherwise distinctly inferior, Gouais blanc. Cross-pollination may have resulted from such close proximity, with the genetic distance between the two parents imparting hybrid vigor leading to the viticultural selection of a diverse range of offspring from this cross (which may, nevertheless, have also resulted from deliberate human intervention). In any case, however, it occurred; offspring of the Pinot–Gouais cross include: Chardonnay, Aligoté, Auxerrois, Gamay, Melon and eleven others. Pinot noir was not necessarily the Pinot involved here; any member of the Pinot family appears genetically capable of being the Pinot parent to these ex-Gouais crosses.

In 1925, Pinot noir was crossed in South Africa with the Cinsaut grape (known locally by the misnomer &#x27;Hermitage&#x27;) to create a unique variety called Pinotage.

==Regions==

===Argentina===

Pinot noir is produced in the wine-growing regions of Mendoza (particularly in the Uco Valley), Patagonia, Neuquén Province and Río Negro Province.

===Australia===

Pinot noir is produced in several wine-growing areas of Australia, notably in the Southern Highlands in New South Wales, Yarra Valley, Geelong, the Bellarine Peninsula, Beechworth, South Gippsland, Sunbury, Macedon Ranges and Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, Adelaide Hills in South Australia, Great Southern Wine Region in Western Australia, all Tasmania, and the Canberra District in the Australian Capital Territory.

Best&#x27;s Wines in Great Western has what is believed to have some of the world&#x27;s oldest Pinot noir plantings—having survived phyloxera, these vines were planted in 1868.

===Austria===

In Austria, Pinot noir is usually called Blauburgunder (literally Blue Burgundy) and produced in Burgenland and Lower Austria. Austrian Pinot noir wines are dry red wines similar in character to the red wines of Burgundy, mostly aged in French barriques. Some of the best Austrian Pinots come from Neusiedlersee and Blaufraenkischland (Burgenland), and Thermenregion (Lower Austria).

===Canada===

Pinot noir has been grown in Ontario for some time in the Niagara Peninsula and especially the Niagara-on-the-Lake and Short Hills Bench wine regions, as well as in Prince Edward County and on the north shore of Lake Ontario. It has also been grown recently in the Okanagan; here it is grown predominantly on the Naramata bench and in the northern Okanagan, Lower Mainland, and Vancouver Island wine regions of British Columbia. It is also grown in the Annapolis Valley region of Nova Scotia and the Lanaudière and Brome-Missisquoi regions of Quebec.

===Chile===

Pinot noir is produced at the Leyda Valley, one of the minor wine districts of the Aconcagua wine region of Chile and in the southern district Biobio.

===UK===
Pinot noir is increasingly being planted in the U.K. and is now the second most widely planted variety (305-ha in 2012), almost all of it for sparkling wine.

===France===

Pinot noir has made France&#x27;s Burgundy appellation famous, and vice versa. Wine historians, including John Winthrop Haeger and Roger Dion, believe that the association between Pinot and Burgundy was the explicit strategy of Burgundy&#x27;s Valois dukes. Roger Dion, in his thesis regarding Philip the Bold&#x27;s role in promoting the spread of Pinot noir, holds that the reputation of Beaune wines as &quot;the finest in the world&quot; was a propaganda triumph of Burgundy&#x27;s Valois dukes. In any event, the worldwide archetype for Pinot noir is that grown in Burgundy, where it has been cultivated since 100 AD. Burgundy is the most northerly good red wine growing district in the World.

Burgundy&#x27;s Pinot noir produces wines that can age well in good years, developing complex fruit and forest floor flavors as they age, often reaching peak 15 or 20 years after the vintage. Many of the wines are produced in small quantities. Today, the Côte d&#x27;Or escarpment of Burgundy has about of Pinot noir. Most of the region&#x27;s finest wines are produced from this area. The Côte Chalonnaise and Mâconnais regions in southern Burgundy have another .

In Jura département, across the river valley from Burgundy, the wines made from Pinot noir are lighter.

In Champagne it is used in blending with Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier. It can also appear unblended; in which case it may be labeled &quot;Blanc de Noirs&quot;. The Champagne appellation has more Pinot planted than any other area of France.

In Sancerre it is used to make red and rosé wines, much lighter in style than those of Burgundy, refreshing served chilled, especially in warmer years when they are less thin.

In Alsace it is generally used to make , similar in character to red Burgundy and Beaujolais wines but usually consumed chilled. Prominent examples are Rouge de Barr and Rouge d&#x27;Ottrott. Pinot noir is the only red wine produced in Alsace.

===Germany===

Among countries planted with Pinot noir, Germany ranks third behind France and the United States. In Germany it is called Spätburgunder () and is now the most widely planted red grape. Historically much German wine produced from Pinot noir was pale, often rosé like the red wines of Alsace; over-cropping and bunch-rot were major contributing factors to this. However, recently, despite the northerly climate, darker, richer reds have been produced, often barrel (barrique) aged, in regions such as Baden, Palatinate (Pfalz) and Ahr. These are rarely exported and are often expensive in Germany for the better examples. In the weekend edition of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; of 21/22 April 2018 Jancis Robinson wrote about ... alternatives to red burgundy As &quot;Rhenish&quot;, German Pinot noir is mentioned several times in Shakespearean plays as a highly prized wine.

There is also a smaller-berried, early ripening, lower yield variety called Frühburgunder (Pinot Noir Précoce; ), which is grown in Rheinhessen and Ahr area and can produce good wines.

===Italy===

In Italy, where Pinot noir is known as Pinot nero, it has traditionally been cultivated in South Tyrol, the Collio Goriziano, Franciacorta, Oltrepò Pavese, Veneto, Friuli and Trentino. It is also planted in Tuscany.
In South Tyrol the variety is first noted 1838 as &quot;Bourgoigne noir&quot; in a grape wine buy list of the &quot;k.u.k. Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft von Tirol und Vorarlberg, Niederlassung Bozen&quot; and later called &quot;Blauburgunder&quot; like in Austria. The first analytical descriptions are from Edmund Mach (founder of Ist. Agr. San Michele a.A.) in the year 1894: Friedrich Boscarolli - Rametz/Meran - Rametzer Burgunder 1890, Chorherrenstift Neustift - Blauburgunder 1890, R.v.Bressendorf - Vernaun/Meran - Burgunder 1890, C. Frank - Rebhof Gries Bozen - Burgunder 1889, Fr. Tschurtschenthaler - Bozen - Burgunder 1890 &amp; 1891, Fr. Tschurtschenthaler - Bozen - Kreuzbichler 1889 &amp; 1891 &amp; 1887.

===Moldova===

Large amounts of Pinot were planted in central Moldova during the 19th century, but much was lost to the ravages of phylloxera; Soviet control of Moldova from 1940 to 1991 also reduced the productivity of vineyards.

===New Zealand===

Pinot noir is New Zealand&#x27;s largest red wine variety, and second largest variety overall behind Sauvignon blanc. In 2014, Pinot noir vines covered and produced 36,500 tonnes of grapes.

Pinot noir is a grape variety whose &quot;importance&quot; in New Zealand is extremely high. However, initial results were not promising for several reasons, including high levels of leaf roll virus in older plantings, and, during the 1960s and 1970s, the limited number and indifferent quality of Pinot noir clones available for planting. However, since this time importation of high-quality clones and much-improved viticulture and winemaking has seen Pinot noir, from Martinborough in the north to Central Otago in the south, become a major factor in New Zealand&#x27;s reputation as a wine producer.

=== Slovenia ===
In Slovenia, the Pinot noir is produced especially in the Slovenian Littoral, particularly in the Goriška Brda sub-region. In smaller amounts, the Pinot noir is also produced in Slovenian Styria.
The wine is usually called Modri Pinot (Blue Pinot) or also Modri Burgundec (Blue Burgundy).

=== South Africa ===
With the growth of the South African wine industry into newer areas, Pinot noir is now also to be found in cool climate Walker Bay and Elgin, the two oldest Pinot regions in the country.

There are currently just over 1,200 ha of Pinot noir in South Africa, making up 1,5% of the total plantings in the country.

The Top 5 Pinot noir Wine Awards annually recognizes the top South African Pinot noir red wines.

===Spain===
In Spain, Pinot noir is grown in many of the wine regions from the north to the south, but the vast majority of Pinot noir is grown in Catalonia, where it is used in still wines and Cava, Spanish sparkling wine. It is an authorised variety in some of the Catalan DOPs. In 2015 there were of Pinot noir grown in Spain.

===Switzerland===

Pinot noir is a popular grape variety all over Switzerland. In German-speaking regions of Switzerland it is often called Blauburgunder. Pinot noir wines are produced in Neuchâtel, Schaffhausen, Zürich, St. Gallen and Bündner Herrschaft (Grisons). In Valais, Pinot noir is also blended with Gamay to produce the well-known Dôle.

===United States===

By volume most Pinot noir in America is grown in California, with Oregon second in production. Other growing regions are the states of Washington, Michigan, and New York.

California wine regions known for producing Pinot noir are:
* Sonoma Coast AVA
* Russian River Valley AVA
* Central Coast AVA
* Sta. Rita Hills
* Monterey County / Santa Lucia Highlands
* Santa Cruz Mountains AVA
* Carneros District of Napa and Sonoma
* Anderson Valley
* Livermore Valley
* San Luis Obispo County / Arroyo Grande Valley, Edna Valley

Oregon wine regions known for producing Pinot noir:
* Willamette Valley AVA
* Dundee Hills AVA
* Eola-Amity Hills AVA
* Yamhill-Carlton District AVA

* Chehalem Mountains AVA
* Ribbon Ridge AVA
* Rogue Valley AVA
* Umpqua Valley AVA

Washington wine regions known for producing Pinot noir:
* Columbia Valley AVA
* Walla Walla Valley AVA
* Yakima Valley
* Wahluke Slope AVA
Richard Sommers of HillCrest Vineyard in the Umpqua Valley of Oregon is the father of Oregon Pinot noir. An early graduate of UC Davis, Sommers moved north after graduation with the idea of planting Pinot noir in the Coastal valleys of Oregon. He brought cuttings to the state in 1959 and made his first commercial planting at HillCrest Vineyard in Roseburg Oregon in 1961. For this, he was honored by the Oregon State House of Representatives (HR 4A). In 2011 the State of Oregon honored him for this achievement and also for producing the first commercial bottling in the state in 1967. It was announced by the state of Oregon in the summer of 2012 that a historical marker would be placed at the winery in the summer of 2013.

Sommers, who graduated from UC Davis in the early 1950s, brought Pinot noir cuttings to Oregon&#x27;s Umpqua Valley in 1959 and planted them at HillCrest Vineyard in 1961. These first Pinot noir cuttings came from Louis Martinis Sr.&#x27;s Stanley Ranch located in the Carneros region of Napa Valley. The first commercial vintage from these grapes was the noted 1967 Pinot noir although test bottlings were made as early as 1963. In the 1970s several other growers followed suit. In 1979, David Lett took his wines to a competition in Paris, known in English as the Wine Olympics, and they placed third among Pinots. In a 1980 rematch arranged by French wine magnate Robert Drouhin, the Eyrie vintage improved to second place. The competition established Oregon as a world-class Pinot noir-producing region.

The Willamette Valley of Oregon is at the same latitude as the Burgundy region of France and has a similar climate in which the finicky Pinot noir grapes thrive. In 1987, Drouhin purchased land in the Willamette Valley, and in 1989 built Domaine Drouhin Oregon, a state-of-the-art, gravity-fed winery. Throughout the 1980s, the Oregon wine industry blossomed.

==Blends==
While Pinot noir is commonly blended in sparkling Champagne (with Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier), in still wines it is best-known as unblended, varietal wines; this is similar to Chardonnay, the other great variety of Burgundy. Some traditional blends of Pinot noir include:
* Jura wine, particularly the Arbois AOC and Côtes du Jura, where it is blended with Trousseau and Poulsard.
* Bourgogne Passe-Tout-Grains AOC, where it is blended with Gamay, and can also be blended with Chardonnay, Pinot blanc, and Pinot gris. Pinot noir is also blended with Gamay in Switzerland.
* Loire Valley (wine), where it is often found in blends, including with Gamay and Cabernet Franc, notably in the Touraine AOC.

Pinot noir may also be blended with other grapes in inexpensive varietal wines, where the Pinot noir percentage is high enough for a varietal labeling but is not 100% (75% in the United States, 85% in the European Union). Commonly a heavier grape like Syrah is used to add color and body, resulting in a wine rather unlike pure Pinot noir wines. This was traditionally done in Burgundy until the 1920s and is today found in California wine. Similarly, it is sometimes blended with Malbec.

==Recent popularity==
Being lighter in style, Pinot noir has benefited from a trend toward more restrained, less alcoholic wines around 12% alcohol by volume.

During 2004 and the beginning of 2005, Pinot noir became considerably more popular among consumers in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Asia as a result of the film &quot;Sideways&quot;, and its deleterious effect on Merlot sales. Throughout the film, the main character speaks fondly of Pinot noir while denigrating Merlot. Following the film&#x27;s U.S. release in October 2004, Merlot sales dropped 2% while Pinot noir sales increased 16% in the Western United States. While the film mainly celebrated California&#x27;s Santa Barbara County, it also highlighted Oregon&#x27;s Pinot Noirs. A similar trend occurred in British wine outlets. A 2009 study by Sonoma State University found that &quot;Sideways&quot; slowed the growth in Merlot sales volume and caused its price to fall, but the film&#x27;s main effect on the wine industry was a rise in the sales volume and price of Pinot noir and in overall wine consumption. A 2014 study by Vineyard Financial Associates estimated that &quot;Sideways&quot; cost American Merlot farmers over US$400m in lost revenue in the decade after its release.

<text>Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, radioactivity, radioactive disintegration, or nuclear disintegration) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered &quot;radioactive&quot;. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha, beta, and gamma decay. The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetic and nuclear forces.

Radioactive decay is a random process at the level of single atoms. According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed. However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as a half-life. The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range: from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe.

The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide. Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons (or both). When the number of protons changes, an atom of a different chemical element is created.

There are 28 naturally occurring chemical elements on Earth that are radioactive, consisting of 35 radionuclides (seven elements have two different radionuclides each) that date before the time of formation of the Solar System. These 35 are known as primordial radionuclides. Well-known examples are uranium and thorium, but also included are naturally occurring long-lived radioisotopes, such as potassium-40. Each of the heavy primordial radionuclides participates in one of the four decay chains.

==History of discovery==
Henri Poincaré laid the seeds for the discovery of radioactivity through his interest in and studies of X-rays, which significantly influenced physicist Henri Becquerel. Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by Becquerel and independently by Marie Curie, while working with phosphorescent materials. These materials glow in the dark after exposure to light, and Becquerel suspected that the glow produced in cathode-ray tubes by X-rays might be associated with phosphorescence. He wrapped a photographic plate in black paper and placed various phosphorescent salts on it. All results were negative until he used uranium salts. The uranium salts caused a blackening of the plate in spite of the plate being wrapped in black paper. These radiations were given the name &quot;Becquerel Rays&quot;.

It soon became clear that the blackening of the plate had nothing to do with phosphorescence, as the blackening was also produced by non-phosphorescent salts of uranium and by metallic uranium. It became clear from these experiments that there was a form of invisible radiation that could pass through paper and was causing the plate to react as if exposed to light.

At first, it seemed as though the new radiation was similar to the then recently discovered X-rays. Further research by Becquerel, Ernest Rutherford, Paul Villard, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and others showed that this form of radioactivity was significantly more complicated. Rutherford was the first to realize that all such elements decay in accordance with the same mathematical exponential formula. Rutherford and his student Frederick Soddy were the first to realize that many decay processes resulted in the transmutation of one element to another. Subsequently, the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy was formulated to describe the products of alpha and beta decay.

The early researchers also discovered that many other chemical elements, besides uranium, have radioactive isotopes. A systematic search for the total radioactivity in uranium ores also guided Pierre and Marie Curie to isolate two new elements: polonium and radium. Except for the radioactivity of radium, the chemical similarity of radium to barium made these two elements difficult to distinguish.

Marie and Pierre Curie&#x27;s study of radioactivity is an important factor in science and medicine. After their research on Becquerel&#x27;s rays led them to the discovery of both radium and polonium, they coined the term &quot;radioactivity&quot; to define the emission of ionizing radiation by some heavy elements. (Later the term was generalized to all elements.) Their research on the penetrating rays in uranium and the discovery of radium launched an era of using radium for the treatment of cancer. Their exploration of radium could be seen as the first peaceful use of nuclear energy and the start of modern nuclear medicine.

==Early health dangers==
The dangers of ionizing radiation due to radioactivity and X-rays were not immediately recognized.

===X-rays===
The discovery of X‑rays by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895 led to widespread experimentation by scientists, physicians, and inventors. Many people began recounting stories of burns, hair loss and worse in technical journals as early as 1896. In February of that year, Professor Daniel and Dr. Dudley of Vanderbilt University performed an experiment involving X-raying Dudley&#x27;s head that resulted in his hair loss. A report by Dr. H.D. Hawks, of his suffering severe hand and chest burns in an X-ray demonstration, was the first of many other reports in &quot;Electrical Review&quot;.

Other experimenters, including Elihu Thomson and Nikola Tesla, also reported burns. Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an X-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering. Other effects, including ultraviolet rays and ozone, were sometimes blamed for the damage, and many physicians still claimed that there were no effects from X-ray exposure at all.

Despite this, there were some early systematic hazard investigations, and as early as 1902 William Herbert Rollins wrote almost despairingly that his warnings about the dangers involved in the careless use of X-rays were not being heeded, either by industry or by his colleagues. By this time, Rollins had proved that X-rays could kill experimental animals, could cause a pregnant guinea pig to abort, and that they could kill a foetus. He also stressed that &quot;animals vary in susceptibility to the external action of X-light&quot; and warned that these differences be considered when patients were treated by means of X-rays.

===Radioactive substances===

However, the biological effects of radiation due to radioactive substances were less easy to gauge. This gave the opportunity for many physicians and corporations to market radioactive substances as patent medicines. Examples were radium enema treatments, and radium-containing waters to be drunk as tonics. Marie Curie protested against this sort of treatment, warning that &quot;radium is dangerous in untrained hands&quot;. Curie later died from aplastic anaemia, likely caused by exposure to ionizing radiation. By the 1930s, after a number of cases of bone necrosis and death of radium treatment enthusiasts, radium-containing medicinal products had been largely removed from the market (radioactive quackery).

===Radiation protection===
Only a year after Röntgen&#x27;s discovery of X-rays, the American engineer Wolfram Fuchs (1896) gave what is probably the first protection advice, but it was not until 1925 that the first International Congress of Radiology (ICR) was held and considered establishing international protection standards. The effects of radiation on genes, including the effect of cancer risk, were recognized much later. In 1927, Hermann Joseph Muller published research showing genetic effects and, in 1946, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his findings.

The second ICR was held in Stockholm in 1928 and proposed the adoption of the röntgen unit, and the International X-ray and Radium Protection Committee (IXRPC) was formed. Rolf Sievert was named chairman, but a driving force was George Kaye of the British National Physical Laboratory. The committee met in 1931, 1934, and 1937.

After World War II, the increased range and quantity of radioactive substances being handled as a result of military and civil nuclear programs led to large groups of occupational workers and the public being potentially exposed to harmful levels of ionising radiation. This was considered at the first post-war ICR convened in London in 1950, when the present International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) was born.
Since then the ICRP has developed the present international system of radiation protection, covering all aspects of radiation hazards.

In 2020, Hauptmann and another 15 international researchers from eight nations (among them: Institutes of Biostatistics, Registry Research, Centers of Cancer Epidemiology, Radiation Epidemiology, and also the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the Radiation Effects Research Foundation of Hiroshima) studied definitively through meta-analysis the damage resulting from the &quot;low doses&quot; that have afflicted survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and also in numerous accidents at nuclear plants that have occurred. These scientists reported, in &quot;JNCI Monographs: Epidemiological Studies of Low Dose Ionizing Radiation and Cancer Risk&quot;, that the new epidemiological studies directly support excess cancer risks from low-dose ionizing radiation. In 2021, Italian researcher Sebastiano Venturi reported the first correlations between radio-caesium and pancreatic cancer with the role of caesium in biology, in pancreatitis and in diabetes of pancreatic origin.

==Units==

The International System of Units (SI) unit of radioactive activity is the becquerel (Bq), named in honor of the scientist Henri Becquerel. One Bq is defined as one transformation (or decay or disintegration) per second.

An older unit of radioactivity is the curie, Ci, which was originally defined as &quot;the quantity or mass of radium emanation in equilibrium with one gram of radium (element)&quot;. Today, the curie is defined as disintegrations per second, so that 1 curie (Ci) = .
For radiological protection purposes, although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the unit curie alongside SI units, the European Union European units of measurement directives required that its use for &quot;public health ... purposes&quot; be phased out by 31 December 1985.

The effects of ionizing radiation are often measured in units of gray for mechanical or sievert for damage to tissue.

==Types==

Radioactive decay results in a reduction of summed rest mass, once the released energy (the &quot;disintegration energy&quot;) has escaped in some way. Although decay energy is sometimes defined as associated with the difference between the mass of the parent nuclide products and the mass of the decay products, this is true only of rest mass measurements, where some energy has been removed from the product system. This is true because the decay energy must always carry mass with it, wherever it appears (see mass in special relativity) according to the formula &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2. The decay energy is initially released as the energy of emitted photons plus the kinetic energy of massive emitted particles (that is, particles that have rest mass). If these particles come to thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and photons are absorbed, then the decay energy is transformed to thermal energy, which retains its mass.

Decay energy, therefore, remains associated with a certain measure of the mass of the decay system, called invariant mass, which does not change during the decay, even though the energy of decay is distributed among decay particles. The energy of photons, the kinetic energy of emitted particles, and, later, the thermal energy of the surrounding matter, all contribute to the invariant mass of the system. Thus, while the sum of the rest masses of the particles is not conserved in radioactive decay, the &quot;system&quot; mass and system invariant mass (and also the system total energy) is conserved throughout any decay process. This is a restatement of the equivalent laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass.

=== Alpha, beta and gamma decay ===

Early researchers found that an electric or magnetic field could split radioactive emissions into three types of beams. The rays were given the names alpha, beta, and gamma, in increasing order of their ability to penetrate matter. Alpha decay is observed only in heavier elements of atomic number 52 (tellurium) and greater, with the exception of beryllium-8 (which decays to two alpha particles). The other two types of decay are observed in all the elements. Lead, atomic number 82, is the heaviest element to have any isotopes stable (to the limit of measurement) to radioactive decay. Radioactive decay is seen in all isotopes of all elements of atomic number 83 (bismuth) or greater. Bismuth-209, however, is only very slightly radioactive, with a half-life greater than the age of the universe; radioisotopes with extremely long half-lives are considered effectively stable for practical purposes.
In analyzing the nature of the decay products, it was obvious from the direction of the electromagnetic forces applied to the radiations by external magnetic and electric fields that alpha particles carried a positive charge, beta particles carried a negative charge, and gamma rays were neutral. From the magnitude of deflection, it was clear that alpha particles were much more massive than beta particles. Passing alpha particles through a very thin glass window and trapping them in a discharge tube allowed researchers to study the emission spectrum of the captured particles, and ultimately proved that alpha particles are helium nuclei. Other experiments showed beta radiation, resulting from decay and cathode rays, were high-speed electrons. Likewise, gamma radiation and X-rays were found to be high-energy electromagnetic radiation.

The relationship between the types of decays also began to be examined: For example, gamma decay was almost always found to be associated with other types of decay, and occurred at about the same time, or afterwards. Gamma decay as a separate phenomenon, with its own half-life (now termed isomeric transition), was found in natural radioactivity to be a result of the gamma decay of excited metastable nuclear isomers, which were in turn created from other types of decay. Although alpha, beta, and gamma radiations were most commonly found, other types of emission were eventually discovered. Shortly after the discovery of the positron in cosmic ray products, it was realized that the same process that operates in classical beta decay can also produce positrons (positron emission), along with neutrinos (classical beta decay produces antineutrinos).

=== Electron capture ===

In electron capture, some proton-rich nuclides were found to capture their own atomic electrons instead of emitting positrons, and subsequently, these nuclides emit only a neutrino and a gamma ray from the excited nucleus (and often also Auger electrons and characteristic X-rays, as a result of the re-ordering of electrons to fill the place of the missing captured electron). These types of decay involve the nuclear capture of electrons or emission of electrons or positrons, and thus acts to move a nucleus toward the ratio of neutrons to protons that has the least energy for a given total number of nucleons. This consequently produces a more stable (lower energy) nucleus.

A hypothetical process of positron capture, analogous to electron capture, is theoretically possible in antimatter atoms, but has not been observed, as complex antimatter atoms beyond antihelium are not experimentally available. Such a decay would require antimatter atoms at least as complex as beryllium-7, which is the lightest known isotope of normal matter to undergo decay by electron capture.

=== Nucleon emission ===

Shortly after the discovery of the neutron in 1932, Enrico Fermi realized that certain rare beta-decay reactions immediately yield neutrons as an additional decay particle, so called beta-delayed neutron emission. Neutron emission usually happens from nuclei that are in an excited state, such as the excited 17O* produced from the beta decay of 17N. The neutron emission process itself is controlled by the nuclear force and therefore is extremely fast, sometimes referred to as &quot;nearly instantaneous&quot;. Isolated proton emission was eventually observed in some elements. It was also found that some heavy elements may undergo spontaneous fission into products that vary in composition. In a phenomenon called cluster decay, specific combinations of neutrons and protons other than alpha particles (helium nuclei) were found to be spontaneously emitted from atoms.

=== More exotic types of decay ===
Other types of radioactive decay were found to emit previously seen particles but via different mechanisms. An example is internal conversion, which results in an initial electron emission, and then often further characteristic X-rays and Auger electrons emissions, although the internal conversion process involves neither beta nor gamma decay. A neutrino is not emitted, and none of the electron(s) and photon(s) emitted originate in the nucleus, even though the energy to emit all of them does originate there. Internal conversion decay, like isomeric transition gamma decay and neutron emission, involves the release of energy by an excited nuclide, without the transmutation of one element into another.

Rare events that involve a combination of two beta-decay-type events happening simultaneously are known (see below). Any decay process that does not violate the conservation of energy or momentum laws (and perhaps other particle conservation laws) is permitted to happen, although not all have been detected. An interesting example discussed in a final section, is bound state beta decay of rhenium-187. In this process, the beta electron-decay of the parent nuclide is not accompanied by beta electron emission, because the beta particle has been captured into the K-shell of the emitting atom. An antineutrino is emitted, as in all negative beta decays.

If energy circumstances are favorable, a given radionuclide may undergo many competing types of decay, with some atoms decaying by one route, and others decaying by another. An example is copper-64, which has 29 protons, and 35 neutrons, which decays with a half-life of hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay to the other particle, which has opposite isospin. This particular nuclide (though not all nuclides in this situation) is more likely to decay through beta plus decay (%) than through electron capture (%). The excited energy states resulting from these decays which fail to end in a ground energy state, also produce later internal conversion and gamma decay in almost 0.5% of the time.

===List of decay modes ===

=== Decay chains and multiple modes ===
The daughter nuclide of a decay event may also be unstable (radioactive). In this case, it too will decay, producing radiation. The resulting second daughter nuclide may also be radioactive. This can lead to a sequence of several decay events called a &quot;decay chain&quot; (see this article for specific details of important natural decay chains). Eventually, a stable nuclide is produced. Any decay daughters that are the result of an alpha decay will also result in helium atoms being created.

Some radionuclides may have several different paths of decay. For example, % of bismuth-212 decays, through alpha-emission, to thallium-208 while % of bismuth-212 decays, through beta-emission, to polonium-212. Both thallium-208 and polonium-212 are radioactive daughter products of bismuth-212, and both decay directly to stable lead-208.

==Occurrence and applications==

According to the Big Bang theory, stable isotopes of the lightest three elements (H, He, and traces of Li) were produced very shortly after the emergence of the universe, in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These lightest stable nuclides (including deuterium) survive to today, but any radioactive isotopes of the light elements produced in the Big Bang (such as tritium) have long since decayed. Isotopes of elements heavier than boron were not produced at all in the Big Bang, and these first five elements do not have any long-lived radioisotopes. Thus, all radioactive nuclei are, therefore, relatively young with respect to the birth of the universe, having formed later in various other types of nucleosynthesis in stars (in particular, supernovae), and also during ongoing interactions between stable isotopes and energetic particles. For example, carbon-14, a radioactive nuclide with a half-life of only years, is constantly produced in Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere due to interactions between cosmic rays and nitrogen.

Nuclides that are produced by radioactive decay are called radiogenic nuclides, whether they themselves are stable or not. There exist stable radiogenic nuclides that were formed from short-lived extinct radionuclides in the early Solar System. The extra presence of these stable radiogenic nuclides (such as xenon-129 from extinct iodine-129) against the background of primordial stable nuclides can be inferred by various means.

Radioactive decay has been put to use in the technique of radioisotopic labeling, which is used to track the passage of a chemical substance through a complex system (such as a living organism). A sample of the substance is synthesized with a high concentration of unstable atoms. The presence of the substance in one or another part of the system is determined by detecting the locations of decay events.

On the premise that radioactive decay is truly random (rather than merely chaotic), it has been used in hardware random-number generators. Because the process is not thought to vary significantly in mechanism over time, it is also a valuable tool in estimating the absolute ages of certain materials. For geological materials, the radioisotopes and some of their decay products become trapped when a rock solidifies, and can then later be used (subject to many well-known qualifications) to estimate the date of the solidification. These include checking the results of several simultaneous processes and their products against each other, within the same sample. In a similar fashion, and also subject to qualification, the rate of formation of carbon-14 in various eras, the date of formation of organic matter within a certain period related to the isotope&#x27;s half-life may be estimated, because the carbon-14 becomes trapped when the organic matter grows and incorporates the new carbon-14 from the air. Thereafter, the amount of carbon-14 in organic matter decreases according to decay processes that may also be independently cross-checked by other means (such as checking the carbon-14 in individual tree rings, for example).

===Szilard–Chalmers effect===
The Szilard–Chalmers effect is the breaking of a chemical bond as a result of a kinetic energy imparted from radioactive decay. It operates by the absorption of neutrons by an atom and subsequent emission of gamma rays, often with significant amounts of kinetic energy. This kinetic energy, by Newton&#x27;s third law, pushes back on the decaying atom, which causes it to move with enough speed to break a chemical bond. This effect can be used to separate isotopes by chemical means.

The Szilard–Chalmers effect was discovered in 1934 by Leó Szilárd and Thomas A. Chalmers. They observed that after bombardment by neutrons, the breaking of a bond in liquid ethyl iodide allowed radioactive iodine to be removed.

=== Origins of radioactive nuclides ===

Radioactive primordial nuclides found in the Earth are residues from ancient supernova explosions that occurred before the formation of the Solar System. They are the fraction of radionuclides that survived from that time, through the formation of the primordial solar nebula, through planet accretion, and up to the present time. The naturally occurring short-lived radiogenic radionuclides found in today&#x27;s rocks, are the daughters of those radioactive primordial nuclides. Another minor source of naturally occurring radioactive nuclides are cosmogenic nuclides, that are formed by cosmic ray bombardment of material in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere or crust. The decay of the radionuclides in rocks of the Earth&#x27;s mantle and crust contribute significantly to Earth&#x27;s internal heat budget.

==Aggregate processes==
While the underlying process of radioactive decay is subatomic, historically and in most practical cases it is encountered in bulk materials with very large numbers of atoms. This section discusses models that connect events at the atomic level to observations in aggregate.

===Terminology===

The &quot;decay rate&quot;, or &quot;activity&quot;, of a radioactive substance is characterized by the following time-independent parameters:
* The &quot;half-life&quot;, , is the time taken for the activity of a given amount of a radioactive substance to decay to half of its initial value.
* The &quot;decay constant&quot;, &quot;lambda&quot;, the reciprocal of the mean lifetime (in ), sometimes referred to as simply &quot;decay rate&quot;.
* The &quot;mean lifetime&quot;, &quot;tau&quot;, the average lifetime (1/e life) of a radioactive particle before decay.

Although these are constants, they are associated with the statistical behavior of populations of atoms. In consequence, predictions using these constants are less accurate for minuscule samples of atoms.

In principle a half-life, a third-life, or even a (1/√2)-life, could be used in exactly the same way as half-life; but the mean life and half-life have been adopted as standard times associated with exponential decay.

Those parameters can be related to the following time-dependent parameters:
* &quot;Total activity&quot; (or just &quot;activity&quot;), , is the number of decays per unit time of a radioactive sample.
* &quot;Number of particles&quot;, , in the sample.
* &quot;Specific activity&quot;, , is the number of decays per unit time per amount of substance of the sample at time set to zero (). &quot;Amount of substance&quot; can be the mass, volume or moles of the initial sample.

These are related as follows:
:formula_1
where &quot;N&quot;0 is the initial amount of active substance — substance that has the same percentage of unstable particles as when the substance was formed.

===Assumptions===

The mathematics of radioactive decay depend on a key assumption that a nucleus of a radionuclide has no &quot;memory&quot; or way of translating its history into its present behavior. A nucleus does not &quot;age&quot; with the passage of time. Thus, the probability of its breaking down does not increase with time but stays constant, no matter how long the nucleus has existed. This constant probability may differ greatly between one type of nucleus and another, leading to the many different observed decay rates. However, whatever the probability is, it does not change over time. This is in marked contrast to complex objects that do show aging, such as automobiles and humans. These aging systems do have a chance of breakdown per unit of time that increases from the moment they begin their existence.

Aggregate processes, like the radioactive decay of a lump of atoms, for which the single-event probability of realization is very small but in which the number of time-slices is so large that there is nevertheless a reasonable rate of events, are modelled by the Poisson distribution, which is discrete. Radioactive decay and nuclear particle reactions are two examples of such aggregate processes. The mathematics of Poisson processes reduce to the law of exponential decay, which describes the statistical behaviour of a large number of nuclei, rather than one individual nucleus. In the following formalism, the number of nuclei or the nuclei population &quot;N&quot;, is of course a discrete variable (a natural number)—but for any physical sample &quot;N&quot; is so large that it can be treated as a continuous variable. Differential calculus is used to model the behaviour of nuclear decay.

====One-decay process====

Consider the case of a nuclide that decays into another by some process (emission of other particles, like electron neutrinos and electrons e− as in beta decay, are irrelevant in what follows). The decay of an unstable nucleus is entirely random in time so it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay. However, it is equally likely to decay at any instant in time. Therefore, given a sample of a particular radioisotope, the number of decay events expected to occur in a small interval of time is proportional to the number of atoms present , that is

:formula_2

Particular radionuclides decay at different rates, so each has its own decay constant . The expected decay is proportional to an increment of time, :

The negative sign indicates that decreases as time increases, as the decay events follow one after another. The solution to this first-order differential equation is the function:

:formula_3

where is the value of at time = 0, with the decay constant expressed as 

We have for all time :

:formula_4

where is the constant number of particles throughout the decay process, which is equal to the initial number of nuclides since this is the initial substance.

If the number of non-decayed nuclei is:

:formula_5

then the number of nuclei of (i.e. the number of decayed nuclei) is

:formula_6

The number of decays observed over a given interval obeys Poisson statistics. If the average number of decays is , the probability of a given number of decays is
:formula_7

====Chain-decay processes====
=====Chain of two decays=====

Now consider the case of a chain of two decays: one nuclide decaying into another by one process, then decaying into another by a second process, i.e. &quot;&quot;. The previous equation cannot be applied to the decay chain, but can be generalized as follows. Since decays into , &quot;then&quot; decays into , the activity of adds to the total number of nuclides in the present sample, &quot;before&quot; those nuclides decay and reduce the number of nuclides leading to the later sample. In other words, the number of second generation nuclei increases as a result of the first generation nuclei decay of , and decreases as a result of its own decay into the third generation nuclei . The sum of these two terms gives the law for a decay chain for two nuclides:

:formula_8

The rate of change of , that is , is related to the changes in the amounts of and , can increase as is produced from and decrease as produces .

Re-writing using the previous results:

The subscripts simply refer to the respective nuclides, i.e. is the number of nuclides of type ; is the initial number of nuclides of type ; is the decay constant for – and similarly for nuclide . Solving this equation for gives:

:formula_9

In the case where is a stable nuclide ( = 0), this equation reduces to the previous solution:

:formula_10

as shown above for one decay. The solution can be found by the integration factor method, where the integrating factor is . This case is perhaps the most useful since it can derive both the one-decay equation (above) and the equation for multi-decay chains (below) more directly.

=====Chain of any number of decays=====

For the general case of any number of consecutive decays in a decay chain, i.e. , where is the number of decays and is a dummy index (), each nuclide population can be found in terms of the previous population. In this case , , ..., . Using the above result in a recursive form:

:formula_11

The general solution to the recursive problem is given by Bateman&#x27;s equations:

====Multiple products====

In all of the above examples, the initial nuclide decays into just one product. Consider the case of one initial nuclide that can decay into either of two products, that is &#x27; and &#x27; in parallel. For example, in a sample of potassium-40, 89.3% of the nuclei decay to calcium-40 and 10.7% to argon-40. We have for all time :

:formula_12

which is constant, since the total number of nuclides remains constant. Differentiating with respect to time:

:formula_13

defining the &quot;total decay constant&quot; in terms of the sum of &quot;partial decay constants&quot; and :

:formula_14

Solving this equation for :

:formula_15

where is the initial number of nuclide A. When measuring the production of one nuclide, one can only observe the total decay constant . The decay constants and determine the probability for the decay to result in products or as follows:

:formula_16

:formula_17

because the fraction of nuclei decay into while the fraction of nuclei decay into .

===Corollaries of laws===

The above equations can also be written using quantities related to the number of nuclide particles in a sample;
* The activity: .
* The amount of substance: .
* The mass: .

where = is the Avogadro constant, is the molar mass of the substance in kg/mol, and the amount of the substance is in moles.

===Decay timing: definitions and relations===

====Time constant and mean-life====

For the one-decay solution &quot;&quot;:

:formula_18

the equation indicates that the decay constant has units of , and can thus also be represented as 1/, where is a characteristic time of the process called the &quot;time constant&quot;.

In a radioactive decay process, this time constant is also the mean lifetime for decaying atoms. Each atom &quot;lives&quot; for a finite amount of time before it decays, and it may be shown that this mean lifetime is the arithmetic mean of all the atoms&#x27; lifetimes, and that it is , which again is related to the decay constant as follows:

:formula_19

This form is also true for two-decay processes simultaneously &quot;&quot;, inserting the equivalent values of decay constants (as given above)

:formula_20

into the decay solution leads to:

:formula_21

====Half-life====

A more commonly used parameter is the half-life . Given a sample of a particular radionuclide, the half-life is the time taken for half the radionuclide&#x27;s atoms to decay. For the case of one-decay nuclear reactions:

:formula_22

the half-life is related to the decay constant as follows: set and = to obtain

:formula_23

This relationship between the half-life and the decay constant shows that highly radioactive substances are quickly spent, while those that radiate weakly endure longer. Half-lives of known radionuclides vary by almost 54 orders of magnitude, from more than years ( sec) for the very nearly stable nuclide 128Te, to seconds for the highly unstable nuclide 5H.

The factor of in the above relations results from the fact that the concept of &quot;half-life&quot; is merely a way of selecting a different base other than the natural base for the lifetime expression. The time constant is the -life, the time until only 1/&quot;e&quot; remains, about 36.8%, rather than the 50% in the half-life of a radionuclide. Thus, is longer than . The following equation can be shown to be valid:

:formula_24

Since radioactive decay is exponential with a constant probability, each process could as easily be described with a different constant time period that (for example) gave its &quot;(1/3)-life&quot; (how long until only 1/3 is left) or &quot;(1/10)-life&quot; (a time period until only 10% is left), and so on. Thus, the choice of and for marker-times, are only for convenience, and from convention. They reflect a fundamental principle only in so much as they show that the &quot;same proportion&quot; of a given radioactive substance will decay, during any time-period that one chooses.

Mathematically, the life for the above situation would be found in the same way as aboveby setting &quot;&quot;, and substituting into the decay solution to obtain

:formula_25

===Example for carbon-14===

Carbon-14 has a half-life of years and a decay rate of 14 disintegrations per minute (dpm) per gram of natural carbon.

If an artifact is found to have radioactivity of 4 dpm per gram of its present C, we can find the approximate age of the object using the above equation:
:formula_26
where:
:formula_27

===Changing rates===
The radioactive decay modes of electron capture and internal conversion are known to be slightly sensitive to chemical and environmental effects that change the electronic structure of the atom, which in turn affects the presence of 1s and 2s electrons that participate in the decay process. A small number of nuclides are affected. For example, chemical bonds can affect the rate of electron capture to a small degree (in general, less than 1%) depending on the proximity of electrons to the nucleus. In 7Be, a difference of 0.9% has been observed between half-lives in metallic and insulating environments. This relatively large effect is because beryllium is a small atom whose valence electrons are in 2s atomic orbitals, which are subject to electron capture in 7Be because (like all s atomic orbitals in all atoms) they naturally penetrate into the nucleus.

In 1992, Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group observed an accelerated β− decay of 163Dy66+. Although neutral 163Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized 163Dy66+ undergoes β− decay into the K and L shells to 163Ho66+ with a half-life of 47 days.

Rhenium-187 is another spectacular example. 187Re normally undergoes beta decay to 187Os with a half-life of 41.6 × 109 years, but studies using fully ionised 187Re atoms (bare nuclei) have found that this can decrease to only 32.9 years. This is attributed to &quot;bound-state β− decay&quot; of the fully ionised atom – the electron is emitted into the &quot;K-shell&quot; (1s atomic orbital), which cannot occur for neutral atoms in which all low-lying bound states are occupied.
A number of experiments have found that decay rates of other modes of artificial and naturally occurring radioisotopes are, to a high degree of precision, unaffected by external conditions such as temperature, pressure, the chemical environment, and electric, magnetic, or gravitational fields. Comparison of laboratory experiments over the last century, studies of the Oklo natural nuclear reactor (which exemplified the effects of thermal neutrons on nuclear decay), and astrophysical observations of the luminosity decays of distant supernovae (which occurred far away so the light has taken a great deal of time to reach us), for example, strongly indicate that unperturbed decay rates have been constant (at least to within the limitations of small experimental errors) as a function of time as well.

Recent results suggest the possibility that decay rates might have a weak dependence on environmental factors. It has been suggested that measurements of decay rates of silicon-32, manganese-54, and radium-226 exhibit small seasonal variations (of the order of 0.1%). However, such measurements are highly susceptible to systematic errors, and a subsequent paper has found no evidence for such correlations in seven other isotopes (22Na, 44Ti, 108Ag, 121Sn, 133Ba, 241Am, 238Pu), and sets upper limits on the size of any such effects. The decay of radon-222 was once reported to exhibit large 4% peak-to-peak seasonal variations (see plot), which were proposed to be related to either solar flare activity or the distance from the Sun, but detailed analysis of the experiment&#x27;s design flaws, along with comparisons to other, much more stringent and systematically controlled, experiments refute this claim.

====GSI anomaly====

An unexpected series of experimental results for the rate of decay of heavy highly charged radioactive ions circulating in a storage ring has provoked theoretical activity in an effort to find a convincing explanation. The rates of weak decay of two radioactive species with half lives of about 40 s and 200 s are found to have a significant oscillatory modulation, with a period of about 7 s.
The observed phenomenon is known as the GSI anomaly, as the storage ring is a facility at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. As the decay process produces an electron neutrino, some of the proposed explanations for the observed rate oscillation invoke neutrino properties. Initial ideas related to flavour oscillation met with skepticism. A more recent proposal involves mass differences between neutrino mass eigenstates.

==Nuclear processes==
A nuclide is considered to &quot;exist&quot; if it has a half-life greater than 2x10−14s. This is an arbitrary boundary; shorter half-lives are considered resonances, such as a system undergoing a nuclear reaction. This time scale is characteristic of the strong interaction which creates the nuclear force. Only nuclides are considered to decay and produce radioactivity.

Nuclides can be stable or unstable. Unstable nuclides decay, possibly in several steps, until they become stable. There are 251 known stable nuclides. The number of unstable nuclides discovered has grown, with about 3000 known in 2006.

The most common and consequently historically the most important forms of natural radioactive decay involve the emission of alpha-particles, beta-particles, and gamma rays. Each of these correspond to a fundamental interaction predominantly responsible for the radioactivity:
* alpha-decay -&gt; strong interaction,
* beta-decay -&gt; weak interaction,
* gamma-decay -&gt; electromagnetism.
In alpha decay, a particle containing two protons and two neutrons, equivalent to a He nucleus, breaks out of the parent nucleus. The process represents a competition between the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons in the nucleus and attractive nuclear force, a residual of the strong interaction. The alpha particle is an especially strongly bound nucleus, helping it win the competition more often. However some nuclei break up or fission into larger particles and artificial nuclei decay with the emission of
single protons, double protons, and other combinations.

Beta decay transforms a neutron into proton or vice versa. When a neutron inside a parent nuclide decays to a proton, an electron, a anti-neutrino, and nuclide with high atomic number results. When a proton in a parent nuclide transforms to a neutron, a positron, a neutrino, and nuclide with a lower atomic number results. These changes are a direct manifestation of the weak interaction.

Gamma decay resembles other kinds of electromagnetic emission: it corresponds to transitions between an excited quantum state and lower energy state. Any of the particle decay mechanisms often leave the daughter in an excited state, which then decays via gamma emission.

Other forms of decay include neutron emission, electron capture, internal conversion, cluster decay.

<text>Sally &quot;Petula&quot; Clark (born 15 November 1932) is a British singer, actress, and songwriter. She started her professional career as a child performer and has had the longest career of any British entertainer, spanning more than 85 years.

Clark&#x27;s professional career began during the Second World War as a child entertainer on BBC Radio. In 1954, she charted with &quot;The Little Shoemaker&quot;, the first of her big UK hits, and within two years she began recording in French. Her international successes have included &quot;&quot;Prends mon cœur&quot;&quot;, &quot;Sailor&quot; (a UK number one), &quot;Romeo&quot;, and &quot;Chariot&quot;. Hits in German, Italian and Spanish followed. In late 1964, Clark&#x27;s success extended to the United States with a five-year run of career-defining, often upbeat singles, many written or co-written by Tony Hatch and Jackie Trent. These include her signature song &quot;Downtown&quot; (US number one), &quot;I Know a Place&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot; (US number one), &quot;A Sign of the Times&quot;, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot;, &quot;Who Am I&quot;, &quot;Colour My World&quot;, &quot;This Is My Song&quot; (by Charlie Chaplin; a UK number one), &quot;Don&#x27;t Sleep in the Subway&quot;, &quot;The Other Man&#x27;s Grass Is Always Greener&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me Goodbye&quot;. Between January 1965 and April 1968, Clark charted with nine US top 20 hits in the US, where she was called &quot;the First Lady of the British Invasion&quot;. Her international chart success was unequalled in recording history. In 1967 she was the recipient of the MIDEM international award for the highest worldwide sales by a female artist. This followed on from her 1966 MIDEM award for most sales in Europe by a European artist. 

Clark has sold more than 70 million records. She also enjoyed success in the musical film &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress in a musical, and in the stage musicals &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; and &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, for which she received BAFTA nominations.

==Biography==
===Early career ===
Petula Clark was born Sally Clark on 15 November 1932 in Ewell, Surrey, England to Doris (&quot;née&quot; Phillips) and Leslie Noah Clark. Both of Clark&#x27;s parents were nurses at Long Grove Hospital in Epsom. Clark&#x27;s mother had Welsh ancestry and her father was English. Clark&#x27;s stage name, Petula, was invented by her father, who joked that it was a combination of the names of his two former girlfriends, Pet and Ulla.

Clark grew up in Abercanaid, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. Her grandfather was a coal miner. Her first ever live audience was in 1939 at the Colliers&#x27; Arms in Abercanaid. She also recalls living just outside London during the Blitz, watching the dogfights in the air and running to air-raid shelters with her sister. Later, when she was eight, she joined other children to record messages with the BBC to be broadcast to members of their families in the forces. The recording event was in the Criterion Theatre, an underground theatre that was safe. When the air-raid siren sounded other children were upset and a call went out for someone to step forward and sing to calm them. Petula volunteered, and they liked her voice so much in the control room that they recorded her. Her song was &quot;Mighty Like a Rose&quot;.

As a child, Clark sang in the chapel choir and showed a talent for mimicry, impersonating Vera Lynn, Carmen Miranda and Sophie Tucker for her family and friends. Her father introduced her to theatre in 1944 when he took her to see Flora Robson in a production of &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;. She later recalled that after the performance, &quot;I made up my mind then and there I was going to be an actress. ... I wanted to be Ingrid Bergman more than anything else in the world.&quot; However her first public performances were as a singer. In 1945 she performed with an orchestra in the entrance hall of Bentall&#x27;s Department Store in Kingston upon Thames for a tin of toffee and a gold wristwatch.

===Career start===
From a chance beginning at the age of seven, Clark appeared on radio, in film, in print, on television and on recordings. In October 1942 the nine-year-old Clark made her radio debut while attending a BBC broadcast with her father. She was trying to send a message to an uncle who was stationed overseas, but the broadcast was delayed by an air raid. During the bombing the producer requested that someone perform to settle the jittery theatre audience and she volunteered a rendering of &quot;Mighty Lak&#x27; a Rose&quot; to an enthusiastic response. She then repeated her performance for the broadcast audience, launching a series of some 500 appearances in programmes designed to entertain the troops. 

In addition to radio work, Clark frequently toured the United Kingdom with fellow child performer Julie Andrews. Nicknamed the &quot;Singing Sweetheart&quot;, she performed for George VI, Winston Churchill and Bernard Montgomery. She also became known as &quot;Britain&#x27;s Shirley Temple&quot;, and was considered a mascot by the British Army, some of whose troops plastered her photos on their tanks for good luck as they advanced into battle.

While she was performing at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 1944, Clark was discovered by the film director Maurice Elvey, who cast her, at the age of 12, as the precocious orphaned waif Irma in his war drama &quot;Medal for the General&quot;. In quick succession she performed in &quot;Strawberry Roan&quot;, &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot;, &quot;London Town&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Huggetts&quot;, &quot;Vote for Huggett&quot; and &quot;The Huggetts Abroad&quot;, the second, third and fourth of four Huggett Family films. She worked with Anthony Newley in &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (directed by Peter Ustinov) and Alec Guinness in &quot;The Card&quot;.

In 1945 she was featured in the comic &quot;Radio Fun&quot;, in which she was billed as &quot;Radio&#x27;s Merry Mimic&quot;. By then she felt that she had played child parts for too long.

In 1946 Clark began her television career with an appearance on a BBC variety show, &quot;Cabaret Cartoons&quot;, which led to her being signed to host her own afternoon series, &quot;Petula Clark&quot;. &quot;Pet&#x27;s Parlour&quot; followed in 1950.

In 1947 she met Joe &quot;Mr Piano&quot; Henderson at the Peter Maurice Publishing Company. The two collaborated musically and were linked romantically over the following ten years. In 1949 Henderson introduced her to the record producer Alan A. Freeman, who, together with her father Leslie, formed Polygon Records, for which she recorded her earliest hits. She recorded her first release that year, &quot;Put Your Shoes On, Lucy&quot;, for EMI, and further recordings with vocalist Benny Lee on Decca. The Polygon label was financed with part of her earnings. She scored a number of major hits in the UK during the 1950s, including &quot;The Little Shoemaker&quot; (1954), &quot;Majorca&quot; (1955), &quot;Suddenly There&#x27;s a Valley&quot; (1955) and &quot;With All My Heart&quot; (1956). &quot;The Little Shoemaker&quot; was an international hit, reaching number one in Australia, the first of many number-one records in her career.

Near the end of 1955 Polygon Records was sold to Nixa Records, then part of Pye Records, leading to the establishment of Pye Nixa Records (subsequently simply Pye). This effectively signed Clark to the Pye label in the UK, for which she recorded until the early 1970s.

During this period she showed a keen interest in encouraging new talent. She suggested that Henderson be allowed to record his own music, and he had five chart hits on Polygon/Pye between 1955 and 1960.

===European fame===
In 1957 Clark was invited to appear at the Paris Olympia, where, despite her misgivings and a bad cold, she was received with acclaim. The following day she was invited to the office of Vogue Records to discuss a contract. There she met her future longtime publicist, collaborator and husband, Claude Wolff. Clark was attracted immediately, and when she was told that she would be working with him if she signed with the Vogue label she agreed.

In 1960 she embarked on a concert tour of France and Belgium with Sacha Distel, who remained a close friend until his death in 2004. Gradually she moved further into the continent, recording in German, French, Italian and Spanish.

While she focused on her new career in France, she continued to achieve hit records in the UK into the early 1960s. Her 1961 recording of &quot;Sailor&quot; became her first number-one hit in the UK, while such follow-up recordings as &quot;Romeo&quot; and &quot;My Friend the Sea&quot; landed her in the British Top-10 later that year. &quot;Romeo&quot; sold more than one million copies around the world and won her her first gold disc, which was awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America. In France &quot;Ya Ya Twist&quot; (a French-language cover of the Lee Dorsey rhythm and blues song &quot;Ya Ya&quot; and the only successful recording of a twist song by a woman) and &quot;Chariot&quot; (the original version of &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot;) became smash hits in 1962, while German and Italian versions of her English and French recordings charted, as well. Her recordings of several Serge Gainsbourg songs were also big sellers. In addition, she was given at this time a present of the song &quot;Un Enfant&quot; by Jacques Brel, with whom she toured. Clark is one of only a handful of performers to be given a song by Brel. A live recording of this song charted in Canada.

In 1963 she wrote the soundtrack for the French crime film &quot;A Couteaux Tirés&quot; (&quot;Daggers Drawn&quot;) - released in 1964 - and made a cameo appearance as herself in the film. Although it was only a mild success, it added a new dimension—that of film composer—to her career. Additional film scores she composed include &quot;Entre ciel et mer&quot; (1963), &quot;Rêves d&#x27;enfant&quot; (1964), &quot;La bande à Bebel&quot; (1966), and &quot;Pétain&quot; (1989). Six themes from the last were released on the CD &quot;In Her Own Write&quot; in 2007.

Clark was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in February 1964, April 1975 and March 1996, becoming the only person to receive the television tribute three times.

===Global fame – the &quot;Downtown&quot; era===
By 1964 Clark&#x27;s British recording career was foundering. Composer/arranger Tony Hatch, who had been assisting her with her work for Vogue Records in France and Pye Records in the UK, flew to her home in Paris with new song material he hoped would interest her, but she found none of it appealing. Desperate, he played for her a few chords of an incomplete song that had been inspired by his recent first trip to New York City. Upon hearing the melody, Clark told him that if he could write lyrics as good as the melody, she wanted to record the tune as her next single—&quot;Downtown&quot;. Hatch has subsequently denied originally offering &quot;Downtown&quot; to the Drifters.

Neither Clark, who was performing in Canada when the song first received major air play, nor Hatch realised the effect the song would have on their respective careers. Released in four separate languages in late 1964, &quot;Downtown&quot; was a success in the UK, France (in both the English and the French versions), the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, and Italy, and Rhodesia, Japan, and India as well. During a visit to London, Warner Bros. executive Joe Smith heard it and acquired the rights for the United States. &quot;Downtown&quot; went to number one in the American charts in January 1965, and 3 million copies were sold in the United States.

&quot;Downtown&quot; was the first of 15 consecutive Top-40 hits she achieved in the U.S., including &quot;I Know a Place&quot;, &quot;My Love&quot; (her second US number-one hit), &quot;A Sign of the Times&quot;, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot;, &quot;This Is My Song&quot; (from the Charles Chaplin film &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot;), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Sleep in the Subway&quot;. The American recording industry honoured her with Grammy Awards for Best Rock &amp; Roll Recording of 1964 for &quot;Downtown&quot; and for Best Contemporary (R&amp;R) Vocal Performance of 1965 – Female for &quot;I Know a Place&quot;. In 2004, her recording of &quot;Downtown&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Her recording successes led to frequent appearances on American variety programmes hosted by Ed Sullivan and Dean Martin, guest shots on &quot;Hullabaloo,&quot; &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;The Kraft Music Hall&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, and inclusion in musical specials such as &quot;The Best on Record&quot; and &quot;Rodgers and Hart Today.&quot;

In 1968 NBC invited Clark to host her own special in the US, and in doing so, she inadvertently made television history. While singing a duet of &quot;On the Path of Glory&quot;, an antiwar song that she had composed, with guest Harry Belafonte, she took hold of his arm, to the dismay of a representative from the Chrysler Corporation (the show&#x27;s sponsor), who feared that the moment would provoke racial backlash from Southern viewers. When he insisted that they substitute a different take, with Clark and Belafonte standing well away from each other, Clark and the executive producer of the show — her husband, Wolff — refused, destroyed all other takes of the song, and delivered the finished programme to NBC with the touch intact. The Chrysler representative lost his job and the programme aired on 8 April 1968, four days after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., with high ratings, critical acclaim, and a Primetime Emmy nomination. It has erroneously been described as the first instance on American television of physical contact between a black man and a white woman, forgetting many previous instances, including Frankie Lymon dancing with a white girl on Alan Freed&#x27;s live ABC show &quot;The Big Beat&quot; on 19 July 1957, Nancy Sinatra kissing Sammy Davis Jr., on her 1967 &quot;Movin&#x27; with Nancy&quot; TV special, and Louis Armstrong shaking hands with &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; panelists Dorothy Kilgallen and Arlene Francis in 1953. To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1968 Belafonte telecast, Clark and Wolff appeared at the Paley Center for Media in Manhattan on 22 September 2008, to discuss the broadcast and its impact, following a showing of the programme.

Clark was later the host of two more specials; &quot;Portrait of Petula&quot;, shown on both the NBC and CBC networks in early 1970, and one for ABC (Petula) which served as a pilot for a projected weekly series. She starred in the BBC television series &quot;This Is Petula Clark&quot;, which aired from mid-1966 to early 1968.

She revived her film career in the late 1960s, starring in two big musical films. In &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; (1968), she starred opposite Fred Astaire, and she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her performance. The following year, she was cast with Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), a musical adaptation of the classic James Hilton novella.

Throughout the late 1960s she toured in concerts in the U.S., and she often appeared in supper clubs such as the Copacabana in New York City, the Ambassador Hotel&#x27;s Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles, and the Empire Room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

During this period Clark continued her interest in encouraging new talent. These efforts also supported the launch of Herb Alpert and his A&amp;M record label. In 1968 she brought the French composer/arranger Michel Colombier to the U.S. to work as her musical director, and introduced him to Alpert. Colombier went on to co-write the film score for &quot;Purple Rain&quot; with Prince, composed the acclaimed pop symphony &quot;Wings&quot;, and a number of soundtracks for American films. Richard Carpenter credited her with bringing his sister Karen and him to Alpert&#x27;s attention when they performed at a premiere party for the 1969 &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;.

She has recalled that she and Karen Carpenter went to see Elvis Presley perform in Las Vegas and that afterwards &quot;He was flirting with both of us, (saying) &#x27;Wow, the two biggest girl pop stars in my dressing room. That&#x27;s pretty good&#x27;... He didn&#x27;t have us, exactly, but he had a darned good try. Not going to talk about that any more.&quot;

Clark was one of the backing vocalists on John Lennon&#x27;s Plastic Ono Band anthem &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot; She was performing in Montreal in June 1969, and was being heckled by the audience due to her bilingual performance. She went to see Lennon for advice on dealing with this. His wife Yoko Ono and he were staying at the city&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hotel during their bed-in protest. Clark subsequently ended up on the recording of &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot; On 15 November 1969, her concert, &quot;An Evening with Petula&quot;, from the Royal Albert Hall in London, was the first BBC One colour transmission.

===1970–2000===
During the early 1970s Clark had chart singles on both sides of the Atlantic with &quot;Melody Man&quot; (1970), &quot;The Song of My Life&quot; (1971), &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How To Love Him&quot; (1972), &quot;The Wedding Song (There Is Love)&quot; (1972), and &quot;Loving Arms&quot; (1974). In Canada, &quot;Je Voudrais Qu&#x27;il Soit Malheureux&quot; was a major hit. She continued touring during the 1970s, performing in clubs in the US and Europe. During this period, she also appeared in print and radio ads for the Coca-Cola Corporation, television commercials for Plymouth automobiles, print and TV spots for Burlington Industries and Chrysler Sunbeam, as well as print ads for Sanderson wallpaper in the UK.

In the mid-1970s she scaled back her career to devote more time to her family. On 31 December 1976, she performed her hit song &quot;Downtown&quot; on BBC1&#x27;s &quot;A Jubilee of Music&quot;, celebrating British popular music for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s impending Silver Jubilee. She also hosted the television series &quot;The Sound of Petula&quot; (1972–74), and through the 1970s, made numerous guest appearances on variety, comedy, and game-show television programmes. She appeared as a special guest star in an episode of The Muppet Show in 1977. In 1980 she made her last film appearance, in the British production &quot;Never Never Land&quot;. Her last television appearance was acting in the 1981 French miniseries &quot;Sans Famille&quot; (&quot;An Orphan&#x27;s Tale&quot;). A 1981 single, &quot;Natural Love&quot;, reached number 66 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 chart and number 20 on the US country singles chart in early 1982.

As Clark moved away from film and television, she returned to the stage. In 1954, she had starred in a stage production of &quot;The Constant Nymph&quot;, but at the urging of her children, did not return to legitimate theatre until 1981, starring as Maria von Trapp in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; at the Apollo Victoria Theatre, West End of London. Opening to positive reviews and what was then the largest advance sale in British theatre history, Clark—proclaimed by Maria Von Trapp herself as &quot;the best Maria ever&quot;—extended her initial six-month run to 13 to accommodate the huge demand for tickets and receiving a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical. On 6 February 1983, during a concert at the Albert Hall she gave a heart-rending performance of For All We Know in tribute to her friend Karen Carpenter who had died two days previously. Also in 1983, she took on the title role in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot;.

Her later stage work includes &quot;Someone Like You&quot; in 1989 and 1990, for which she composed the score; &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, in which she made her Broadway debut in 1993 at the Music Box Theatre, followed by the American tour; and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, appearing in both the West End and American touring productions from 1995 to 2000. In 2004, she repeated her performance of Norma Desmond in a production at the Opera House in Cork, Ireland, which was later broadcast by the BBC. With more than 2,500 performances, she has played the role more often than any other actress.

A new disco remix of &quot;Downtown&quot;, called &quot;Downtown &#x27;88&quot;, was released in 1988, registering her first UK singles chart success since 1972, making the Top 10 in the UK in December 1988. A live vocal performance of this version was performed on the BBC show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Clark recorded new material regularly throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, and in 1992 released &quot;Oxygen&quot;, a single produced by Andy Richards and written by Nik Kershaw.

In 1998 Clark was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. In 2012 she was installed as a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France by the French Minister of Culture.

===2000–present===

In both 1998 and 2002 Clark toured extensively throughout the UK. In 2000, she presented a self-written, one-woman show, highlighting her life and career, to large critical and audience acclaim at the St. Denis Theatre in Montreal. A 2003 concert appearance at the Olympia in Paris has been issued in both DVD and compact disc formats. In 2004, she toured Australia and New Zealand, appeared at the Hilton in Atlantic City, New Jersey; the Hummingbird Centre in Toronto; Humphrey&#x27;s in San Diego; and the Mohegan Sun Casino in Uncasville, Connecticut; and participated in a multiperformer tribute to the late Peggy Lee at the Hollywood Bowl. Following another British concert tour in early spring 2005, after which, in May she contributed to the &quot;V45&quot; televised BBC concert in Trafalgar Square at which she sang &quot;A Nightingale sang in Berkeley Square&quot;, she appeared with Andy Williams in his Moon River Theatre in Branson, Missouri, for several months, and she returned for another engagement in autumn of 2006, following scattered concert dates throughout North America.

In November 2006 Clark was the subject of a BBC Four documentary titled &quot;Petula Clark: Blue Lady&quot;, and appeared with Michael Ball and Tony Hatch in a concert at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane broadcast by BBC Radio the following month. In December that year, she made her first appearance in Iceland. &quot;Duets&quot;, a compilation including Dusty Springfield, Peggy Lee, Dean Martin, Bobby Darin and the Everly Brothers, among others, was released in February 2007; and &quot;Solitude and Sunshine&quot;, a studio recording of all new material by composer Rod McKuen, was released in July of that year. She was the host of the March 2007 PBS fundraising special &quot;My Music: The British Beat,&quot; an overview of the musical British invasion of the United States during the 1960s, followed by a number of concert dates throughout the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. She can be heard on the soundtrack of the 2007 independent film &quot;&quot;. &quot;Une Baladine&quot; (in English, a wandering minstrel), an authorised pictorial biography by Françoise Piazza, was published in France and Switzerland in October 2007, and the following month she promoted it in bookshops and at book fairs.

In 2005 she took part in the BBC Wales programme &quot;Coming Home,&quot; about her Welsh family history.

She was presented with the 2007 Film and TV Music Award for Best Use of a Song in a Television Programme for &quot;Downtown&quot; in the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot;. She completed a concert tour of England and Wales in summer 2008, followed by concerts in Switzerland and the Philippines. &quot;Then &amp; Now&quot;, a compilation of greatest hits and several new Clark compositions, entered the UK Albums Chart in June 2008 and won Clark her first silver disc for an album. &quot;Open Your Heart: A Love Song Collection&quot;, a compilation of previously unreleased material and new and remixed recordings, was released in January 2009. Additionally, her 1969 NBC special &quot;Portrait of Petula&quot;, already released on DVD for Region 2 viewers, is also being produced for Region 1. A collection of holiday songs titled &quot;This Is Christmas,&quot; which includes some new Clark compositions in addition to previously released material, was released in November 2009.

At the Montreux Jazz Festival on 14 July 2008 Clark joined with Paolo Nutini to perform &quot;Goin&#x27; to Chicago Blues&quot; in celebration of Quincy Jones&#x27; 75th birthday.

In 2010 she became president of the Hastings Musical Festival; she toured Australia, New Zealand and Quebec to sell-out crowds, and appeared on the &quot;Vivement Dimanche&quot; show on French television, where she promised a return to Paris in the new year. Her triple album &quot;Une Baladine&quot; included 10 new tracks and one new studio recording: &quot;SOS Mozart&quot;, a writing collaboration of Gilbert Bécaud and Pierre Delanoë. Both her album set and the new recording of &quot;SOS Mozart&quot; were produced by David Hadzis at the Arthanor Productions studio in Geneva and appeared on the French charts. She was patron of 2011 Dinard British Film Festival.

Early in 2011 the Lark Street Business Improvement District in a section of the downtown area of Albany, New York, needed a name for its logo/mascot, a graphic image of a blue lark. An internet poll was held, and the winner was &quot;Petula Lark&quot;, clearly a reference to the singer of the adopted anthem of New York City&#x27;s urban area, &quot;Downtown&quot;. In November 2011, at age 78, Clark performed at the Casino de Paris, a Parisian music hall. She entertained for more than 90 minutes and introduced five new songs, one of which she had recently written with friend Charles Aznavour. A French album of all new material was to be released on 7 February 2012 on the Sony label, her first in that language since the late 1970s.

On 11 December 2011 the Saw Doctors released their version of &quot;Downtown&quot;, featuring Clark. She appeared in the video for the song, which they recorded in Galway, and she in Paris. On 22 December 2011, the record reached number two on the Irish chart. In February 2012 Clark completed her first New York City show since 1975. Her show featured a parody of &quot;Downtown&quot;, an idea that came from her musical director Grant Sturiale. After the end of her season, which was extended due to the demand for tickets, she returned to Paris to promote her new album, before flying to Australia for a tour.

Clark appeared as a guest on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Reunion&quot; in August 2012. In January 2013, she released a new album titled &quot;Lost in You&quot;. The album contains new music and some covers. She remade her famous &quot;Downtown&quot;, and performed a cover of Gnarls Barkley&#x27;s &quot;Crazy&quot;. She also performed a new song called &quot;Cut Copy Me&quot;, which had a 14-week run in the Belgium chart. The album entered the UK national album chart at number 24 on Sunday, 3 March 2013. Two of the songs, &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;Downtown&quot;, were performed in Jools Holland&#x27;s New Year &quot;Hootenanny&quot; on 1 January 2013, along with her 1966 number-six hit, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot;. On 20 June 2015 she appeared with the Midtown Men at the Beacon Theatre in New York City, performing &quot;Downtown&quot;. Clark released a new English-language album, &quot;From Now On&quot;, in October 2016, and completed a tour of the UK to promote it. She made a cameo appearance in the 2017 London Heathrow Airport Christmas television commercial, accompanied by her song, &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live without Your Love&quot;.

On 10 November 2017 an English-language album was released, &quot;Living for Today&quot;. She embarked on a tour of the US in November 2017. It was her first US tour in five decades. On 20 April 2018 a French-Canadian album was released, &quot;Vu d&#x27;ici&quot;. In March 2019 she was announced as returning to the West End stage in London for the first time in 20 years, performing in the upcoming revival of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; as The Bird Woman. In March 2020 the United Music Foundation released &quot;A Valentine&#x27;s Day at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, a collector&#x27;s edition including the complete recording of her legendary concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 14 February 1974.

Clark appeared in &quot;Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s Old Friends&quot; concert which aired on the BBC in January 2023. She performed &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; from &quot;Follies&quot;. The CD recording of this performance was released physically and digitally in December 2023.

== Personal life ==
In 1955 Clark became linked romantically with Joe &quot;Mr Piano&quot; Henderson. Speculation that the couple planned to marry became rife. However, with the increasing glare of the public spotlight and her growing fame – her career in France was just beginning – Henderson, reportedly not wanting to end up as &quot;Mr Petula Clark&quot;, decided to end the relationship, although they remained on friendly terms. Their professional relationship continued for a few years, culminating in the BBC Radio series &quot;Pet and Mr Piano&quot;, which was the last time they worked together. In 1962, he penned a ballad about their break-up, called &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing More To Say&quot;, for Clark&#x27;s LP &quot;In Other Words&quot;. In 1967 in Las Vegas, she was a witness at the wedding of her friend, French singer Charles Aznavour, alongside Sammy Davis Jr.

In October 1957, Clark was invited to appear at the Paris Olympia for Europe&#x27;s premier live radio show, &quot;Musicorama&quot;. The next day, she was invited to the office of Vogue Records&#x27; chairman Léon Cabat to discuss recording in French and working in France. There she met her future husband, publicist Claude Wolff, to whom she was attracted immediately, and when she was told that he would work with her if she recorded in French; she agreed. They were married in June 1961 and have two daughters, Barbara and Kate, and a son, Patrick. They also have two adult grandchildren. Clark has expressed regret about not being closer to her children when they were younger, as her busy schedule kept her away. In 2013, Clark stated that she and Wolff were &quot;not in a romantic relationship anymore.&quot; Wolff died on 20 March 2024.

Following the 1979 UK general election, in which Margaret Thatcher won a majority for the Conservatives, becoming Britain&#x27;s first female prime minister, Clark sent Thatcher a congratulatory telegram, saying, &quot;Felicitations – so happy for you and for Britain.&quot; The same year, Clark performed at a Young Conservatives rally. However, in 2002, she attended a fundraiser for Labour prime minister Tony Blair.

Since the 1960s, Clark has called Geneva, Switzerland home. She also has a holiday chalet in the French Alps, where she likes to ski, and a &quot;pied-à-terre&quot; in London&#x27;s Chelsea.

<text>In nuclear science a decay chain refers to the predictable series of radioactive disintegrations undergone by the nuclei of certain unstable chemical elements. 

Radioactive isotopes do not usually decay directly to stable isotopes, but rather into another radioisotope. The isotope produced by this radioactive emission then decays into another, often radioactive isotope. This chain of decays always terminates in a stable isotope, whose nucleus no longer has the surplus of energy necessary to produce another emission of radiation. Such stable isotopes are then said to have nuclei that have reached their &quot;ground states&quot;.

The stages or steps in a decay chain are referred to by their relationship to previous or subsequent stages. Hence, a &quot;parent isotope&quot; is one that undergoes decay to form a &quot;daughter isotope&quot;. For example element 92, uranium, has an isotope with 144 neutrons (236U) and it decays into an isotope of element 90, thorium, with 142 neutrons (232Th). The daughter isotope may be stable or it may itself decay to form another daughter isotope. 232Th does this when it decays into radium-228. The daughter of a daughter isotope, such as 228Ra, is sometimes called a &quot;granddaughter isotope&quot;.

The time required for an atom of a parent isotope to decay into its daughter is fundamentally unpredictable and varies widely. For individual nuclei the process is not known to have determinable causes and the time at which it occurs is therefore completely random. The only prediction that can be made is statistical and expresses an average rate of decay. This rate can be represented by adjusting the curve of a decaying exponential distribution with a decay constant (&quot;λ&quot;) particular to the isotope. On this understanding the radioactive decay of an initial population of unstable atoms over time &quot;t&quot; follows the curve given by &quot;e&quot;−&quot;λt&quot;.

One of the most important properties of any radioactive material follows from this analysis, its half-life. This refers to the time required for half of a given number of radioactive atoms to decay and is inversely related to the isotope&#x27;s decay constant, &quot;λ&quot;. Half-lives have been determined in laboratories for many radionuclides, and can range from nearly instantaneous—hydrogen-5 decays in less time than it takes for a photon to go from one end of its nucleus to the other—to fourteen orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe: tellurium-128 has a half-life of .
The Bateman equation predicts the relative quantities of all the isotopes that compose a given decay chain once that decay chain has proceeded long enough for some of its daughter products to have reached the stable (i.e., nonradioactive) end of the chain. A decay chain that has reached this state, which may require billions of years, is said to be in &quot;equilibrium&quot;. A sample of radioactive material in &quot;equilibrium&quot; produces a steady and steadily decreasing quantity of radioactivity as the isotopes that compose it traverse the decay chain. On the other hand, if a sample of radioactive material has been isotopically enriched, meaning that a radioisotope is present in larger quantities than would exist if a decay chain were the only cause of its presence, that sample is said to be &quot;out of equilibrium&quot;. An unintuitive consequence of this disequilibrium is that a sample of enriched material may occasionally increase in radioactivity as daughter products that are more highly radioactive than their parents accumulate. Both enriched and depleted uranium provide examples of this phenomenon.

== History ==
The chemical elements came into being in two phases. The first commenced shortly after the Big Bang. From ten seconds to 20 minutes after the beginning of the universe the earliest condensation of light atoms was responsible for the manufacture of the four lightest elements. The vast majority of this primordial production consisted of the three lightest isotopes of hydrogen—protium, deuterium and tritium—and two of the nine known isotopes of helium—helium-3 and helium-4. Trace amounts of lithium-7 and beryllium-7 were likely also produced. 

So far as is known, all heavier elements came into being starting around 100 million years later, in a second phase of nucleosynthesis that commenced with the birth of the first stars. The nuclear furnaces that power stellar evolution were necessary to create large quantities of all elements heavier than helium, and the r- and s-processes of neutron capture that occur in stellar cores are thought to have created all such elements up to iron and nickel (atomic numbers 26 and 28). The extreme conditions that attend supernovae explosions are capable of creating the elements between oxygen and rubidium (i.e., atomic numbers 8 through 37). The creation of heavier elements, including those without stable isotopes—all elements with atomic numbers greater than lead&#x27;s, 82—appears to rely on r-process nucleosynthesis operating amid the immense concentrations of free neutrons released during neutron star mergers.

Most of the isotopes of each chemical element present in the Earth today were formed by such processes no later than the time of our planet&#x27;s condensation from the solar protoplanetary disc, around 4.5 billion years ago. The exceptions to these so-called &quot;primordial&quot; elements are those that have resulted from the radioactive disintegration of unstable parent nuclei as they progress down one of several decay chains, each of which terminates with the production of one of the 251 stable isotopes known to exist. Aside from cosmic or stellar nucleosynthesis, and decay chains the only other ways of producing a chemical element rely on atomic weapons, nuclear reactors (natural or manmade) or the laborious atom-by-atom assembly of nuclei with particle accelerators.

Unstable isotopes decay to their daughter products (which may sometimes be even more unstable) at a given rate; eventually, often after a series of decays, a stable isotope is reached: there are 251 stable isotopes in the universe. In stable isotopes, light elements typically have a lower ratio of neutrons to protons in their nucleus than heavier elements. Light elements such as helium-4 have close to a 1:1 neutron:proton ratio. The heaviest elements such as uranium have close to 1.5 neutrons per proton (e.g. 1.587 in uranium-238). No nuclide heavier than lead-208 is stable; these heavier elements have to shed mass to achieve stability, mostly by alpha decay. The other common way for isotopes with a high neutron to proton ratio (n/p) to decay is beta decay, in which the nuclide changes elemental identity while keeping the same mass number and lowering its n/p ratio. For some isotopes with a relatively low n/p ratio, there is an inverse beta decay, by which a proton is transformed into a neutron, thus moving towards a stable isotope; however, since fission almost always produces products which are neutron heavy, positron emission or electron capture are rare compared to electron emission. There are many relatively short beta decay chains, at least two (a heavy, beta decay and a light, positron decay) for every discrete weight up to around 207 and some beyond, but for the higher mass elements (isotopes heavier than lead) there are only four pathways which encompass all decay chains. This is because there are just two main decay methods: alpha radiation, which reduces the mass by 4 atomic mass units (amu), and beta, which does not change the mass number (just the atomic number and the p/n ratio). The four paths are termed 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2, and 4n + 3; the remainder from dividing the atomic mass by four gives the chain the isotope will use to decay. There are other decay modes, but they invariably occur at a lower probability than alpha or beta decay. (It should not be supposed that these chains have no branches: the diagram below shows a few branches of chains, and in reality there are many more, because there are many more isotopes possible than are shown in the diagram.) For example, the third atom of nihonium-278 synthesised underwent six alpha decays down to mendelevium-254, followed by an electron capture (a form of beta decay) to fermium-254, and then a seventh alpha to californium-250, upon which it would have followed the 4n + 2 chain (radium series) as given in this article. However, the heaviest superheavy nuclides synthesised do not reach the four decay chains, because they reach a spontaneously fissioning nuclide after a few alpha decays that terminates the chain: this is what happened to the first two atoms of nihonium-278 synthesised, as well as to all heavier nuclides produced.

Three of those chains have a long-lived isotope (or nuclide) near the top; this long-lived nuclide is a bottleneck in the process through which the chain flows very slowly, and keeps the chain below them &quot;alive&quot; with flow. The three long-lived nuclides are uranium-238 (half-life 4.5 billion years), uranium-235 (half-life 700 million years) and thorium-232 (half-life 14 billion years). The fourth chain has no such long-lasting bottleneck nuclide near the top, so almost all of the nuclides in that chain have long since decayed down to just before the end: bismuth-209. This nuclide was long thought to be stable, but in 2003 it was found to be unstable, with a very long half-life of 20.1 billion billion years; it is the last step in the chain before stable thallium-205. Because this bottleneck is so long-lived, very small quantities of the final decay product have been produced, and for most practical purposes bismuth-209 is the final decay product.

In the distant past, during the first few million years of the history of the Solar System, there were more kinds of unstable high-mass nuclides in existence, and the four chains were longer, as they included nuclides that have since decayed away. Notably, 244Pu, 237Np, and 247Cm have half-lives over a million years and would have then been lesser bottlenecks high in the 4n, 4n+1, and 4n+3 chains respectively. (There is no nuclide with a half-life over a million years above 238U in the 4n+2 chain.) Today some of these formerly extinct isotopes are again in existence as they have been manufactured. Thus they again take their places in the chain: plutonium-239, used in nuclear weapons, is the major example, decaying to uranium-235 via alpha emission with a half-life 24,500 years. There has also been large-scale production of neptunium-237, which has resurrected the hitherto extinct fourth chain. The tables below hence start the four decay chains at isotopes of californium with mass numbers from 249 to 252.

These four chains are summarised in the chart in the following section.

== Types of decay ==
 The four most common modes of radioactive decay are: alpha decay, beta decay, inverse beta decay (considered as both positron emission and electron capture), and isomeric transition. Of these decay processes, only alpha decay (fission of a helium-4 nucleus) changes the atomic mass number (&quot;A&quot;) of the nucleus, and always decreases it by four. Because of this, almost any decay will result in a nucleus whose atomic mass number has the same residue mod 4. This divides the list of nuclides into four classes. All the members of any possible decay chain must be drawn entirely from one of these classes.

Three main decay chains (or families) are observed in nature. These are commonly called the thorium series, the radium or uranium series, and the actinium series, representing three of these four classes, and ending in three different, stable isotopes of lead. The mass number of every isotope in these chains can be represented as &quot;A&quot; = 4&quot;n&quot;, &quot;A&quot; = 4&quot;n&quot; + 2, and A = 4&quot;n&quot; + 3, respectively. The long-lived starting isotopes of these three isotopes, respectively thorium-232, uranium-238, and uranium-235, have existed since the formation of the Earth, ignoring the artificial isotopes and their decays created since the 1940s.

Due to the relatively short half-life of its starting isotope neptunium-237 (2.14 million years), the fourth chain, the neptunium series with &quot;A&quot; = 4&quot;n&quot; + 1, is already extinct in nature, except for the final rate-limiting step, decay of bismuth-209. Traces of 237Np and its decay products do occur in nature, however, as a result of neutron capture in uranium ore. The ending isotope of this chain is now known to be thallium-205. Some older sources give the final isotope as bismuth-209, but in 2003 it was discovered that it is very slightly radioactive, with a half-life of .

There are also non-transuranic decay chains of unstable isotopes of light elements, for example those of magnesium-28 and chlorine-39. On Earth, most of the starting isotopes of these chains before 1945 were generated by cosmic radiation. Since 1945, the testing and use of nuclear weapons has also released numerous radioactive fission products. Almost all such isotopes decay by either β− or β+ decay modes, changing from one element to another without changing atomic mass. These later daughter products, being closer to stability, generally have longer half-lives until they finally decay into stability.

== Actinide alpha decay chains ==

In the four tables below, the minor branches of decay (with the branching probability of less than 0.0001%) are omitted. The energy release includes the total kinetic energy of all the emitted particles (electrons, alpha particles, gamma quanta, neutrinos, Auger electrons and X-rays) and the recoil nucleus, assuming that the original nucleus was at rest. The letter &#x27;a&#x27; represents a year (from the Latin &quot;annus&quot;).

In the tables below (except neptunium), the historic names of the naturally occurring nuclides are also given. These names were used at the time when the decay chains were first discovered and investigated. From these historical names one can locate the particular chain to which the nuclide belongs, and replace it with its modern name.

The three naturally-occurring actinide alpha decay chains given below—thorium, uranium/radium (from uranium-238), and actinium (from uranium-235)—each ends with its own specific lead isotope (lead-208, lead-206, and lead-207 respectively). All these isotopes are stable and are also present in nature as primordial nuclides, but their excess amounts in comparison with lead-204 (which has only a primordial origin) can be used in the technique of uranium–lead dating to date rocks.
=== Thorium series ===

The 4n chain of thorium-232 is commonly called the &quot;thorium series&quot; or &quot;thorium cascade&quot;. Beginning with naturally occurring thorium-232, this series includes the following elements: actinium, bismuth, lead, polonium, radium, radon and thallium. All are present, at least transiently, in any natural thorium-containing sample, whether metal, compound, or mineral. The series terminates with lead-208.

Plutonium-244 (which appears several steps above thorium-232 in this chain if one extends it to the transuranics) was present in the early Solar System, and is just long-lived enough that it should still survive in trace quantities today, though it is uncertain if it has been detected.

The total energy released from thorium-232 to lead-208, including the energy lost to neutrinos, is 42.6 MeV.

===Neptunium series===

The 4n + 1 chain of neptunium-237 is commonly called the &quot;neptunium series&quot; or &quot;neptunium cascade&quot;. In this series, only two of the isotopes involved are found naturally in significant quantities, namely the final two: bismuth-209 and thallium-205. Some of the other isotopes have been detected in nature, originating from trace quantities of 237Np produced by the (n,2n) knockout reaction in primordial 238U. A smoke detector containing an americium-241 ionization chamber accumulates a significant amount of neptunium-237 as its americium decays. The following elements are also present in it, at least transiently, as decay products of the neptunium: actinium, astatine, bismuth, francium, lead, polonium, protactinium, radium, radon, thallium, thorium, and uranium. Since this series was only discovered and studied in 1947–1948, its nuclides do not have historic names. One unique trait of this decay chain is that the noble gas radon is only produced in a rare branch (not shown in the illustration) but not the main decay sequence; thus, radon from this decay chain does not migrate through rock nearly as much as from the other three. Another unique trait of this decay sequence is that it ends in thallium (practically speaking, bismuth) rather than lead. This series terminates with the stable isotope thallium-205.

The total energy released from californium-249 to thallium-205, including the energy lost to neutrinos, is 66.8 MeV.

=== Uranium series ===

The 4n+2 chain of uranium-238 is called the &quot;uranium series&quot; or &quot;radium series&quot;. Beginning with naturally occurring uranium-238, this series includes the following elements: astatine, bismuth, lead, mercury, polonium, protactinium, radium, radon, thallium, and thorium. All are present, at least transiently, in any natural uranium-containing sample, whether metal, compound, or mineral. The series terminates with lead-206.

The total energy released from uranium-238 to lead-206, including the energy lost to neutrinos, is 51.7 MeV.

=== Actinium series ===
The 4n+3 chain of uranium-235 is commonly called the &quot;actinium series&quot; or &quot;actinium cascade&quot;. Beginning with the naturally-occurring isotope uranium-235, this decay series includes the following elements: actinium, astatine, bismuth, francium, lead, polonium, protactinium, radium, radon, thallium, and thorium. All are present, at least transiently, in any sample containing uranium-235, whether metal, compound, ore, or mineral. This series terminates with the stable isotope lead-207.
In the early Solar System this chain went back to 247Cm. This manifests itself today as variations in 235U/238U ratios, since curium and uranium have noticeably different chemistries and would have separated differently.

The total energy released from uranium-235 to lead-207, including the energy lost to neutrinos, is 46.4 MeV.

<doc id="197776" wikidata="Q3186762" url="?curid=197776" title="Evacuation Day (Massachusetts)">
<text>Evacuation Day is a holiday observed on March 17 in Suffolk County, Massachusetts (which includes the cities of Boston, Chelsea, and Revere, and the town of Winthrop), and also by the public schools in Somerville, Massachusetts. The holiday commemorates the evacuation of British forces from the city of Boston following the siege of Boston, early in the American Revolutionary War. Schools and government offices are closed. If March 17 falls on a weekend, schools and government offices are closed on the following Monday in observance. It is the same day as Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, a coincidence that played a role in the establishment of the holiday.

==Historical background==

The 11-month siege of Boston ended when the Continental Army under the command of George Washington fortified Dorchester Heights in early March 1776 with cannons captured at Ticonderoga. British General William Howe&#x27;s garrison and navy were threatened by these positions, and they were forced to decide between attack and retreat. Howe decided to retreat in order to prevent what could have been a repeat of the Battle of Bunker Hill, withdrawing from Boston to Nova Scotia on March 17, 1776.

The British evacuation was Washington&#x27;s first victory of the war. It was also a huge morale boost for the Thirteen Colonies.

==Establishment of the holiday==
Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parades have been held in Boston since 1876, but Evacuation Day was not declared a holiday in the city until 1901 amid interest in local history that also resulted in the construction of the Dorchester Heights Monument. The state made it a holiday in Suffolk County in 1938. The large Irish population of Boston at that time played a role in the establishment of the holiday. A 1941 law established the holiday in Suffolk County, signed in both black and green ink.

==Observance activities==
Evacuation Day activities are limited in the areas that observe the holiday. The Allied War Veterans of South Boston mark the day with a ceremony on Dorchester Heights. The city of Boston offers free parking for the day.

==Moves to eliminate holiday==
In 2010, the state legislature debated eliminating Evacuation Day and Bunker Hill Day as official holidays, citing the expense of giving state and local workers paid days off. The state&#x27;s 2011 budget required all state and municipal offices in Suffolk County to be open on both days.

<doc id="197778" wikidata="Q698676" url="?curid=197778" title="Stan Brakhage">
<text>James Stanley Brakhage ( ; January 14, 1933 – March 9, 2003) was an American experimental filmmaker. He is considered to be one of the most important figures in 20th-century experimental film.

Over the course of five decades, Brakhage created a large and diverse body of work, exploring a variety of formats, approaches and techniques that included handheld camerawork, painting directly onto celluloid, fast cutting, in-camera editing, scratching on film, collage film and the use of multiple exposures. Interested in mythology and inspired by music, poetry and visual phenomena, Brakhage sought to reveal the universal, in particular exploring themes of birth, mortality, sexuality, and innocence. His films are for the most part silent.

Brakhage&#x27;s films are often noted for their expressiveness and lyricism. While they were for many years obscure and hard to find, many are now archived and readily available on modern home media.

==Biography==
Born Robert Sanders in Kansas City, Missouri on January 14, 1933, Brakhage was adopted and renamed three weeks after his birth by Ludwig and Clara Brakhage.

As a child Brakhage was featured on radio as a boy soprano, and sang in church choirs and as a soloist at other events. He was raised in Denver, Colorado, where he attended South High School with the filmmakers Larry Jordan and Stan Phillips, and the composers James Tenney and Ramiro Cortes. At South he and other friends (Larry Hackstaff, Walt Newcomb, Gordon Rosenblum, Tom O&#x27;Brien, Stan Phillips and others) formed a social and intellectual group, calling themselves &quot;the Gadflies&quot;, after Socrates.

Brakhage briefly attended Dartmouth College on a scholarship before dropping out to make films. He completed his first film, &quot;Interim&quot;, at the age of 19; the music for the film was composed by his school friend James Tenney. In 1953, Brakhage moved to San Francisco to attend the San Francisco Art Institute, then called the California School of Fine Arts. He found the atmosphere in San Francisco more rewarding, associating with poets Robert Duncan and Kenneth Rexroth, but did not complete his education, instead moving to New York City in 1954. There, he met a number of notable artists, including Maya Deren (in whose apartment he briefly lived), Willard Maas, Jonas Mekas, Marie Menken, Joseph Cornell and John Cage. Brakhage would collaborate with the latter two, making two films with Cornell (&quot;Gnir Rednow&quot; and &quot;Centuries of June&quot;) and using Cage&#x27;s music for the soundtrack of his first color film, &quot;In Between&quot;. Brakhage is on record as having said: &quot;If there is one single filmmaker that I owe the most to for the crucial development of my own film making it would be Marie Menken.&quot;

Brakhage spent the next few years living in near poverty, depressed about what he saw as the failure of his work. He briefly considered suicide. While living in Denver, Brakhage met Mary Jane Collom (see Jane Wodening), whom he married in late 1957. Brakhage tried to make money on his films, but had to take a job making industrial shorts to support his family. In 1958, Jane gave birth to the first of the five children they would have together, a daughter called Myrrena, an event Brakhage recorded for his 1959 film &quot;Window Water Baby Moving&quot;.

In 1959 Brakhage also released the film &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;. His friend Carolee Schneemann, who also appeared in several other Brakhage films, appeared in this one, in which she wore an apron at Brakhage&#x27;s insistence. Despite her friendship with Brakhage, she later described the experience as &quot;frightening,&quot; remarking that &quot;whenever I collaborated, went into a male friend&#x27;s film, I always thought I would be able to hold my presence, maintain an authenticity. It was soon gone, lost in their celluloid dominance--a terrifying experience--experiences of true dissolution.&quot;

===The 1960s and beginning of recognition===
When Brakhage&#x27;s early films had been exhibited in the 1950s, and they had often been met with derision, but in the early 1960s Brakhage began to receive recognition in exhibitions and film publications, including &quot;Film Culture&quot;, which gave awards to several of his films, including &quot;The Dead&quot;, in 1962. The award statement, written by Jonas Mekas, a critic who would later become an influential experimental filmmaker in his own right, cited Brakhage for bringing to cinema &quot;an intelligence and subtlety that is usually the province of the older arts.&quot; Writer/critic Guy Davenport, an ardent admirer of Brakhage, invited him to the University of Kentucky in March 1964 and tried to get him a residency there.

From 1961 to 1964, Brakhage worked on a series of five films known as the &quot;Dog Star Man&quot; cycle. The Brakhages moved to Lump Gulch, Colorado, in 1964, though Brakhage continued to make regular visits to New York. During one of those visits, the 16mm film equipment he had been using was stolen. Brakhage couldn&#x27;t afford to replace it, instead opting to buy cheaper 8mm film equipment. He soon began working in the format, producing a 30-part cycle of 8mm films known as the &quot;Songs&quot; from 1964 to 1969. The &quot;Songs&quot; include one of Brakhage&#x27;s most acclaimed films, &quot;23rd Psalm Branch&quot;, a response to the Vietnam War and its presentation in the mass media.

===1970s and 1980s===

Brakhage explored new approaches to filmmaking in the 1970s. In 1971, he completed a set of three films inspired by public institutions in the city of Pittsburgh. These three films—&quot;Eyes&quot;, about the city police, &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, filmed in a hospital, and &quot;The Act of Seeing with One&#x27;s Own Eyes&quot;, depicting autopsy—are collectively known as &quot;The Pittsburgh Trilogy&quot;. In 1974, Brakhage made the feature-length &quot;The Text of Light&quot;, consisting entirely of images of light refracted in a glass ashtray. In 1979, he experimented with Polavision, a format marketed by Polaroid, making about five minute films. The whereabouts of these films are unknown as of 2024. He continued his visual explorations of landscape and the nature of light and thought process, and through the late 1970s and early 1980s produced filmic equivalents of what he termed &quot;moving visual thinking&quot; in several series of photographic abstractions known as the Roman, Arabic, and Egyptian series.

Stan Brakhage taught at the University of Colorado in Boulder off and on, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He separated from Jane in 1986, and in 1989 married his second wife, Marilyn; the two went on to have two children together. In the late 1980s, Brakhage returned to making sound films, with the four-part &quot;Faustfilm&quot; cycle, and also completed the hand-painted film, &quot;The Dante Quartet&quot;.

Brakhage was awarded the Edward MacDowell Medal in 1989.

===1990s – 2000s and death===
Brakhage remained extremely productive through the last two decades of his life, sometimes working in collaboration with other filmmakers, including his University of Colorado colleague Phil Solomon. Several more sound films were completed, including &quot;Passage Through: A Ritual&quot;, edited to the music of Philip Corner, &quot;Christ Mass Sex Dance&quot; and &quot;Ellipses Reel 5&quot;, both with music by James Tenney. He also produced the major meditations on childhood, adolescence, aging and mortality collectively known as the &quot;Vancouver Island Quartet,&quot; as well as numerous hand-painted works.

Brakhage was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1996, and his bladder was removed. The surgery seemed successful, but the cancer eventually returned. In a video interview in 2002, he explained that his cancer was caused by the toxicity of the aniline dyes he had used to paint directly onto film.

Brakhage retired from teaching and moved to Canada in 2002, settling with his second wife Marilyn and their two sons in Victoria, British Columbia. Brakhage died there on March 9, 2003, aged 70. The last footage Brakhage shot has been made available under the title &quot;Work in Progress&quot;. At the time of his death, Brakhage was also working on the &quot;Chinese Series&quot;, a work that was achieved by scratching directly on to film, a technique that was employed by the French artist Isidore Isou in 1950.

Though not a practicing Christian during his adulthood, Brakhage requested a traditional Anglican service. The funeral was attended largely by family members, as well as a few friends from the filmmaking world, and included a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.

==Influence==
In 1961, Jonas Mekas wrote that Brakhage is &quot;one of the four or five most authentic film artists working in cinema anywhere, and perhaps the most original filmmaker in America today&quot;. Among Brakhage&#x27;s students were Eric Darnell, the director of &quot;Antz&quot;, as well as the creators of &quot;South Park&quot;, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and he is featured in their student film &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;.

Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; uses Brakhage&#x27;s painted film style to depict the death of Jesus on the cross. Scorsese has framed samples of Brakhage&#x27;s films on his office wall.

The work of contemporary film and video artist Raymond Salvatore Harmon (1974- ) has been compared to Brakhage&#x27;s abstract films.

The credits of the film &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), with their scratched emulsion, rapid cutaways and bursts of light are in Brakhage&#x27;s style.

The opening track of Stereolab&#x27;s album &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; (1997), &quot;Brakhage&quot;, is named after him.

Sonic Youth, joined by percussionist Tim Barnes, played along with silent Stan Brakhage films at a 2003 benefit show for Anthology Film Archives. The live recording is available as SYR6: Koncertas Stan Brakhage Prisiminimui.

The concluding credits to &quot;The Jacket&quot; (2005) are an homage to Brakhage&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;Mothlight&quot;.

The opening titles to the BBC television series &quot;The Living and the Dead&quot; (2016) use an excerpt from &quot;Mothlight&quot;.

The 2011 film &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; and Part 8 of &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot; (2017) include sequences reminiscent of Brakhage&#x27;s work.

==Filmography==
==Writings==
Brakhage wrote a number of books about films, including &quot;Metaphors on Vision&quot; (1963), &quot;A Moving Picture Giving and Taking Book&quot; (1971), &quot;Film Biographies&quot; (1977, Turtle Island Books) and the posthumously published &quot;Telling Time: Essays of a Visionary Filmmaker&quot; (2003). Transcripts of his talks at the Chicago Art Institute were edited and published as &quot;Film at Wit&#x27;s End: Eight Avant-Garde Filmmakers,&quot; (Kingston, New York, McPherson &amp; Co., 1989).

==Archives==
Brakhage&#x27;s archival material, including correspondence, manuscripts, and audio recordings, are held by the University of Colorado as part of the collection of the Brakhage Center. Brakhage&#x27;s films, including original elements and prints, are held by the Academy Film Archive in the Stan Brakhage Collection. The Academy Film Archive has preserved and restored many Brakhage films and continues to do so. Films preserved include &quot;Window Water Baby Moving&quot;, &quot;The Act of Seeing with One&#x27;s Own Eyes&quot;, &quot;Anticipation of the Night&quot; and &quot;Interim&quot;.

<doc id="197780" wikidata="Q599838" url="?curid=197780" title="Budai">
<text>Budai is a nickname given to the historical Chinese monk Qieci () in the Later Liang Dynasty, who is often identified with and venerated as the future or Maitreya Buddha in Chan Buddhism and Buddhist scripture. With the spread of Chan Buddhism, he also came to be venerated in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. Budai is said to have lived around the 10th century CE in the Wuyue kingdom. 

The name &quot;Budai&quot; literally means &quot;cloth sack&quot;, and refers to the bag he is usually depicted carrying as he wanders aimlessly. His jolly nature, humorous personality, and eccentric lifestyle distinguish him from most Buddhist masters or figures. He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname in Chinese, the &quot;Laughing Buddha&quot;. Budai is traditionally depicted as overweight and having a huge stomach (possibly a symbol of abundance or forgiveness) and many stories surrounding Budai involve his love of food and drink. Because of this, he is also referred to as the &quot;Fat Buddha&quot;, especially in the Western world. He is often mistaken by Westerners to be the original Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama.

The main textual record of Budai&#x27;s life resides in a collection of Chan Buddhist monks&#x27; biographies known as &quot;The Transmission of the Lamp&quot;.

==Hagiography==
Budai has origins centered on cult worship and local legend. He is traditionally depicted as a fat, bald monk wearing a simple robe. He carries his few possessions in a cloth sack, being poor but content. He would excitingly entertain the adoring children that followed him and was known for patting his large belly happily. His figure appears throughout Chinese culture as a representation of both contentment and abundance. Budai attracted the townspeople around him as he was able to predict people&#x27;s fortunes and even weather patterns. The wandering monk was often inclined to sleep anywhere he came to, even outside, for his mystical powers could ward off the bitter colds of snow and his body was left unaffected. 

A recovered death note dated to 28 March 917, which the monk himself wrote, claims that he is an incarnation of Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future. A body allegedly belonging to Budai was embalmed and displayed at the eastern section of the Great Hall at Yuelin Temple in Fenghua District, Zhejiang.

==Role in Chan Buddhist Pantheon==
Budai was one of several &quot;uncommitted saints&quot; that became incorporated into the Chan pantheon. Similar &quot;eccentric&quot; figures from the lamp histories were never officially inducted or appropriated into the Chan patriarchal line. Instead, these obscure figures represented the &quot;special transmission&quot; that occurred during the early to mid 12th century. This transmission did not rely on patriarchal lineage legitimacy but instead used the peculiar personalities and qualities of various folkloric figures to illustrate the Chan tradition&#x27;s new commitment to the idea of &quot;awakening&quot; and the propagation of Chan to a larger congregation. The Chan Masters, Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163) and Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091–1157), were both leaders in the initial merging of local legend and Buddhist tradition. They hoped the induction of likable and odd figures would attract all types of people to the Chan tradition, no matter their gender, social background, or complete understanding of the dharma and patriarchal lineage. Bernard Faure summarizes this merging of local legend and Chan tradition by explaining, &quot;One strategy in Chan for domesticating the occult was to transform thaumaturges into tricksters by playing down their occult powers and stressing their this-world aspect...&quot; The movement allocated the figures as religious props and channeled their extraordinary charismas into the lens of the Chan pantheon in order to appeal to a larger population. Ultimately, Budai was revered from both a folkloric standpoint as a strange, wandering vagabond of the people as well as from his newfound personage within the context of the Chan tradition as a &#x27;mendicant priest&#x27; who brought abundance, fortune, and joy to all he encountered with the help of his mystical &quot;cloth sack&quot; bag.

==In art==
Budai is almost always depicted with his cloth sack that looks like a large bag. The bag serves as a prominent motif within the context of Chan Buddhism as it represents abundance, prosperity, and contentment. Ink paintings such as these attributed to Budai often had an inscription and seal that signaled to high-ranking officials. For example, &quot;Budai and Jiang Mohe&quot; was inscribed by Chusi Fanqi, who was closely related to Song Lian (1310–1381) and Wei Su (1295–1372).

After Chan Buddhism was transmitted to Japan around the 13th century as Zen Buddhism, the devout monastics and laymen of the area utilized figure painting to portray the characters central to this &quot;awakening&quot; period of Zen art. Many of the eccentric personalities that were inducted into the Zen tradition like Budai were previously wrapped up in the established culture and folklore of Japan. The assimilation and reapplication of these wondrous charismas to the Zen pantheon assisted in the expansion of the Zen tradition.

As the images demonstrate, Budai is most jubilant when in the presence of others, especially children. When depicted with other gods in the Seven Lucky Gods, Budai maintains a solemn or even depressed countenance. Budai&#x27;s round figure comes into practical use through the sculpting of the incense box (18th century) that splits the monk&#x27;s body into two halves. The newer images such as &quot;Hotei and Children Carrying Lanterns&quot; (19th century) employs much more color, dramatization of physical features, and detail than the older pieces such as &quot;Hotei&quot; from Mokuan Reien (1336) that employs much more wispy and heavily contrasting outlines of his figure with no color or assumed setting.

Japanese iconography, like that of Zen master Hakuin Ekaku, shows Budai in a multiplicity of representative actions, like entertaining passersby, sheltering children under an umbrella and meditating using his sack as a cushion. In an especially known motif, Budai appears smoking in a kiseru and exhaling Otafuku, an ugly but charming prostitute that embodies Zen happiness, in a humorous reflection of the tradition according to which Shandao exhaled Amida, Kannon and Seishi with a prayer. The smooth lumpfish is known in Japan as &quot;hotei-uo&quot; (&quot;Budai fish&quot;) due to its rotund appearance.

==Confusion with other religious figures==

===Angida===
Angida was one of the original Eighteen Arhats. According to legend, Angida was a talented Indian snake catcher whose aim was to catch venomous snakes to prevent them from biting passers-by. Angida would also remove the snake&#x27;s venomous fangs and release them. Due to his kindness, he was able to attain bodhi.

In Chinese art, Angida is sometimes portrayed as Budai, being rotund, laughing, and carrying a bag.

===Gautama Buddha===

In the Western world, Budai is often mistaken for Gautama Buddha himself, and thus is nicknamed the &quot;Fat Buddha&quot;.

===Kangxi Emperor===
In Mongolia, Budai is called Enkh Amaglan Khan, which is identical to the Mongolian name for the Kangxi Emperor. Because of this, Budai is often mistaken for the Kangxi Emperor.

===Phra Sangkajai===
In Thailand, Budai is sometimes confused with the arhat Kaccāyana, known in Thailand as &quot;Phra Sangkajai&quot; or &quot;Phra Sangkachai&quot;. Buddha praised Phra Sangkajai for his excellence in explaining sophisticated concepts of the dhamma in an easily and correctly understandable manner. Phra Sangkajai is also known for composing the &quot;Madhupindika Sutta&quot;.

One story from Thai folklore relates that Phra Sangkajai was so handsome that even a man once wanted him for a wife. To avoid a similar situation, Phra Sangkajai decided to transform himself into a fat monk. Another tale says he was so attractive that angels and men often compared him with the Buddha. He considered this inappropriate, so disguised himself in a fat body.

Although both Budai and Phra Sangkajai may be found in both Thai and Chinese temples, Phra Sangkajai is found more often in Thai temples, and Budai in Chinese temples. Two points to distinguish them from one another are:
# Phra Sangkajai has a trace of hair on his head (looking similar to the Buddha&#x27;s) while Budai is clearly bald.
# Phra Sangkajai wears the robes in Theravada fashion, with the robes folded across one shoulder, leaving the other uncovered. Budai wears the robes in Chinese style, covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered.

<text>Hydatius, also spelled Idacius () was a late Western Roman writer and clergyman. The bishop of Aquae Flaviae in the Roman province of Gallaecia (almost certainly the modern Chaves, Portugal, in the modern district of Vila Real), he was the author of a chronicle of his own times that provides us with our best evidence for the history of Hispania in the 5th century.

==Biography==
Hydatius was born around the year 400 in the environs of Civitas Lemica, a Roman town near modern Xinzo de Limia in the Spanish Galician province of Ourense. As a young boy, he travelled as a pilgrim to the Holy Land with his mother, where he met Jerome in his hermitage at Bethlehem. About the year 417 he joined the clergy, and in 427 was consecrated bishop probably of Chaves (the Roman &quot;Aquae Flaviae&quot;) in Gallaecia. As bishop he had to come to terms with the presence of non-Roman powers, especially a succession of kings of the Suevi, in a province where imperial control became increasingly nominal during the course of his lifetime. The Suevi had settled in Gallaecia in 411, and there was constant friction between them and the local Hispano-Roman provincials. In this context, Hydatius took part in a deputation of the year 431 requesting assistance in dealing with the Suevi from the general Flavius Aëtius, the most important representative of the imperial government in the West.

Along with this concern, Hydatius devoted himself to rooting out heresy, not just in his own episcopal diocese, but in the rest of Hispania as well. He was in frequent contact with some important bishops of the day, including Thoribius of Astorga and Antoninus of Mérida. Together with Thoribius, he petitioned Pope Leo I for assistance and advice in dealing with heresy. Though Hydatius consistently characterizes Hispanian heretics as Manichees, it is generally believed that he meant Priscillianists, followers of the ascetic bishop Priscillian, who had been condemned as a heretic by several church councils and executed as a magician by the emperor Magnus Maximus around 385. We know very little else about Hydatius&#x27;s life, though we know he was kidnapped and imprisoned for a time in 460 by local enemies, which suggests he played an important role in the internal politics of Roman Gallaecia.

Hydatius probably died in 468 or shortly after, since at that point his chronicle breaks off abruptly.

==Chronicle==
Hydatius&#x27;s main claim to historical importance is the chronicle he wrote towards the end of his life. The chronicle was a very popular historical genre in Late Antiquity, though with precedents in older chronographic genres like the &quot;Fasti consulares&quot;. A consciously Christian genre, the main goal of the chronicle was to place human history in the context of a linear progression from creation according Genesis to the Second Coming of Christ. Under the entry for each year one or several events were listed, usually with great brevity. The greatest exponent of the form had been the fourth-century bishop Eusebius of Caesarea. Jerome brought the Greek chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea up to date as far as the year 378, after translating it into Latin. Jerome&#x27;s translation and continuation proved very popular, and others decided to continue Jerome in the same way.

Hydatius was one such continuator. His continuation begins with a preface explaining his debt to Jerome, and then picks up in the year 379. Hydatius had access to a number of chronographic and historical sources and used four parallel chronological systems. Because of this, and particularly towards the end of the chronicle, it can be difficult to translate his chronology into any modern calendar. At the beginning, Hydatius&#x27;s continuation offers relatively little information for each year. He narrates the events from 427 onward as a contemporary witness and the text becomes increasingly full as the years progress until it resembles an organic literary work more than a typical chronicle.

Hydatius&#x27;s main concern throughout is to show the dissolution of civil society in the western Roman empire and in Hispania in particular, and he paints a very dark picture of fifth-century life. His deep pessimism may stem from a belief in the imminent end of the world, since he had read the apocryphal letter of Christ to Thomas, which was interpreted to show that the world would end in May 482. Hydatius may thus have believed that he was chronicling the world&#x27;s last days, and on occasion he deliberately distorted his account to show events in a gloomier light. This is especially true of the narrative climax of his account, the sack in 456 of the Suevi capital at Braga by the Visigothic king Theodoric II, acting in the service of the Roman emperor Avitus. Regardless of his sometimes very sophisticated literary devices, Hydatius&#x27;s chronicle is an essential source of information for reconstructing the course of fifth-century events. Moreover, it is our only source for the history of Hispania in the period up to 468, at which point the narrative breaks off.

It is doubtful whether Hydatius is also the author of the &quot;Fasti consulares&quot; for the years 245–468, appended to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; in the only almost complete manuscript in our possession. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; is printed in Migne, &quot;P.L.&quot; vol. 51, 873–890, and vol. 74, 701–750; the &quot;Fasti Consulares&quot; are found in P.L., vol. 51, 891–914.

<text>East Turkestan or East Turkistan (, : , : ), also called Uyghuristan (, : ), is a loosely-defined geographical region in the northwestern part of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, on the cross roads of East and Central Asia. The term was coined in the 19th century by Russian Turkologists, including Nikita Bichurin, who intended the name to replace the common Western term for the region, &quot;Chinese Turkestan&quot;, which referred to the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang or Xinjiang as a whole during the Qing dynasty. Beginning in the 17th century, Altishahr, which means &quot;Six Cities&quot; in Uyghur, became the Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin. Uyghurs also called the Tarim Basin &quot;Yettishar,&quot; which means &quot;Seven Cities,&quot; and even &quot;Sekkizshahr&quot;, which means &quot;Eight Cities&quot; in Uyghur. Chinese dynasties from the Han dynasty to the Tang dynasty had called an overlapping area the &quot;Western Regions&quot;.

Starting in the 20th century, Uyghur separatists and their supporters used East Turkestan as an appellation for the whole of Xinjiang (the Tarim Basin and Dzungaria) or for a future independent state in present-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. They reject the name Xinjiang (meaning &quot;New Frontier&quot; in Chinese) because of the Chinese perspective reflected in the name, and prefer East Turkestan to emphasize the connection to other, western Turkic groups.

The First East Turkestan Republic existed from November 12, 1933, to April 16, 1934, and the Second East Turkestan Republic existed between November 12, 1944, and June 27, 1946. East Turkestan is a founding member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) formed in 1991, where it was represented initially by the East Turkistan National Congress and later by the World Uyghur Congress post 2004. In September 2004, the East Turkistan Government in Exile was established in Washington, D.C.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;East Turkestan&quot; was coined in the 19th century by Russian Turkologists, including Nikita Bichurin, who intended the name to replace the common Western term for the region, &quot;Chinese Turkestan&quot;, which referred to the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang or sometimes Xinjiang as a whole during the Qing dynasty. The term &quot;Uyghuristan&quot; means &#x27;land of Uyghurs&#x27;. The latter name was given to the region by medieval Muslim geographers.

==History==
===Pre-20th century===

In China, the term Western Regions (; Uyghur: Qurighar, Қуриғар) referred to the regions west of the Yumen Pass. During the 2nd century BC, Chinese writers called the city states of the northern and southern rim of the Taklamakan Desert the &quot;Walled city-states of the Western Regions&quot;. In 60 BC, the Han dynasty established the Protectorate of the Western Regions &quot;in charge of all the oasis-states of the Tarim Basin&quot; which they ruled in indirectly with small agricultural military colonies. The Protector General was stationed at Wulei (west of Karasahr). The city-states were able to conduct their own independent policies with each other. After the Western Han period that ended in 9 AD, China lost its authority over the Western Regions until it was restored in 94 AD and officially lasted until 107 AD. After the crackdown of internal separatist forces, the Eastern Han dynasty set up another protectorate known as the Chief Official of the Western Regions instead. Since the Han, successive Chinese governments had to deal with secessionist movements and local rebellions from different peoples in the region. However, even when Xinjiang was not under Chinese political control, Xinjiang has long had &quot;close contacts with China&quot; that distinguish it from the independent Turkic countries of Central Asia. A Sogdian sale contract of a female slave from the period of the Gaochang kingdom under the rule of Qu clan&quot; from 639 CE mentioned the Sogdian word &quot;twrkstn&quot;, which may have referred to the lands to the east and north of Syr Darya in the realm of the First Turkic Khaganate.

The Gökturks, known in ancient Chinese with pronunciation as Tutkyud as well as modern Chinese pronunciation as Tujue (Tu-chueh; ), united the Turkic peoples and created a large empire, which broke into various Khanates or Khaganates; the Western Turkic Khaganate inherited Xinjiang, but West Tujue became part of China&#x27;s Tang dynasty until the ninth century. However, the terms for West Tujue and East Tujue do not have any relation with the terms West and East Turkestan. &quot;Turkestan&quot;, which means &quot;region of the Turks&quot;, was defined by Arab geographers in the ninth and tenth centuries as the areas northeast of the Sir River. For those Arab writers, the Turks were Turkic-speaking nomads and not the sedentary Persian-speaking oasis dwellers. With the various migrations and political upheavals following the collapse of the Gökturk confederation and the Mongol invasions, &quot;Turkestan&quot;, according to the official Chinese position, gradually ceased to be a useful geographic descriptor and was not used.

During the sixteenth century, the Chagatai Khanate completed the Islamification and Turkification of western Xinjiang and the surrounding region, known then as Moghulistan, while China&#x27;s Ming dynasty held the Eastern Areas. After the Fall of the Ming dynasty, a western Mongol group established a polity in &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot;, as it was sometimes known, or in eastern Xinjiang, expanding southward into southern Xinjiang. In 1755, the Qing dynasty defeated the Mongol Dzungar Khanate and captured two territories in Xinjiang. The northern territory, where the Dzungars lived, was called Dzungaria, while the southern areas, which the Dzungars controlled and mined, were called Huijiang (Hui-chiang; ) or Altishahr. The term &quot;Xinjiang&quot;, which, up until that time, simply meant all territories new to the Qing, gradually shifted in meaning for the Qing court to exclusively mean Dzungaria and Altishahr taken together. In 1764, the Qianlong Emperor made this use of Xinjiang as a proper name official and issued an imperial order defining Xinjiang as a &quot;provincial administrative area&quot;. After General Tso (Tso Ts&#x27;ung T&#x27;ang) suppressed the Dungan revolt in 1882, Xinjiang was officially reorganized into a province and the name Xinjiang was popularized, superseding &quot;Xiyu&quot; in writing.

At the same time as the Chinese consolidation of control in Xinjiang, explorers from the British and Russian Empires explored, mapped, and delineated Central Asia in a competition of colonial expansion. Several influential Russians would propose new terms for the territories, as in 1805 when the Russian explorer Timovski revived the use of &quot;Turkestan&quot; to refer to Middle Asia and &quot;East Turkestan&quot; to refer to the Tarim Basin east of Middle Asia in southern Xinjiang or, in 1829, when the Russian sinologist Nikita Bichurin proposed the use of &quot;East Turkestan&quot; to replace &quot;Chinese Turkestan&quot; for the Chinese territory east of Bukhara. The Russian Empire mused expansion into Xinjiang, which it informally called &quot;Little Bukhara&quot;. Between 1851 and 1881, Russia occupied the Ili valley in Xinjiang and continued to negotiate with the Qing for trading and settlement rights for Russians. Regardless of the new Russian appellations, the original inhabitants of Central Asia generally continued not to use the word &quot;Turkestan&quot; to refer to their own territories.
After a spate of annexations in Middle Asia, Russia consolidated its holdings west of the Pamir Mountains as the Turkestan Governorate or &quot;Russian Turkestan&quot; in 1867. It is at this time that Western writers began to divide Turkestan into a Russian and a Chinese part. Although foreigners acknowledged that Xinjiang was a Chinese polity, and that there were Chinese names for the region, some travelers preferred to use &quot;names that emphasized Turkic, Islamic, or Central Asian, i.e., non-Chinese characteristics&quot;. For contemporary British travelers and English-language material, there was no consensus on a designation for Xinjiang, with &quot;Chinese Turkestan&quot;, &quot;East Turkestan&quot;, &quot;Chinese Central Asia&quot;, &quot;Serindia&quot;, and &quot;Sinkiang&quot; being used interchangeably to describe the region of Xinjiang. Until the 20th century, locals used the names of cities or oases in their &quot;territorial self-perception&quot;, which expanded or contracted as needed, such as Kashgaria out of Kashgar to refer to southwestern Xinjiang. Altishahr, or &quot;six cities&quot;, collectively referred to six vaguely defined cities south of the Tian Shan.

===Early 20th century===
In 1912, the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and created a Republic of China. As Yuan Dahua, the last Qing governor, fled from Xinjiang, one of his subordinates, Yang Zengxin (楊增新), took control of the province and acceded in name to the Republic of China in March of the same year. In 1921, the Soviet Union officially defined the Uyghurs as the sedentary Turkic peoples from Chinese Turkestan as part of their nation building policy in Central Asia. Multiple insurgencies arose against Yang&#x27;s successor Jin Shuren (金树仁) in the early 1930s throughout Xinjiang, usually led by Hui people. &quot;East Turkestan&quot; became a rallying cry for people who spoke Turki and believed in Islam to rebel against Chinese authorities.

In the Kashgar region on November 12, 1933, Uyghur separatists declared the short-lived and self-proclaimed East Turkestan Republic (ETR), using the term &quot;East Turkestan&quot; to emphasize the state&#x27;s break from China and new anti-China orientation. Influenced by pan-Islamism and pan-Turkism, these separatists established a constitution which mandated Sharia law in the short-lived Islamic republic.

The First ETR gave political meaning to the erstwhile geographical term of East Turkestan. It was not recognized by any country, however. Chinese warlord Sheng Shicai (盛世才) quickly defeated the ETR and ruled Xinjiang for the decade after 1934 with close support from the Soviet Union.

Eventually, the Soviet Union exploited the change in power from Sheng to Kuomintang officials to create the puppet Second East Turkestan Republic (1944–1946) in present-day Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture to exploit its minerals, later justifying it as a national liberation movement against the &quot;reactionary&quot; Kuomintang regime. Amid the anti-Han programs and policies and exclusion of &quot;pagans&quot;, or non-Muslims, from the separatist government, Kuomintang leaders based in Dihua (Ürümqi) appealed to the long Chinese history in the region to justify its sovereignty over Xinjiang. In response, Soviet historians produced revisionist histories to help the ETR justify its own claims to sovereignty, with statements such as that the Uyghurs were the &quot;most ancient Turkic people&quot; that had contributed to world civilization. In June 1946, the Soviet Union withdrew its support for the ETR.

Traditionally, scholars had thought of Xinjiang as a &quot;cultural backwater&quot; compared to the other Central Asian states during the Islamic Golden Age. Local British and US consuls, also intrigued by the separatist government, published their own histories of the region. The Soviet Uyghur histories produced during its support of the ETR remain the basis of Uyghur nationalist publications today.

===Late 20th century===
At the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, with Xinjiang divided between Kuomintang forces and ETR secessionists, the Communist leadership persuaded both governments to surrender and accept the succession of the People&#x27;s Republic of China government and negotiated the establishment of Communist provincial governments in Yining (Ghulja) and Dihua. On October 1, 1955, Chinese Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong designated Xinjiang a &quot;Uyghur Autonomous Region&quot;, creating a regionwide Uyghur identity which overtook Uyghurs&#x27; traditionally local and oasis-based identities. Although the Soviet Union initially suppressed the publications of its past Uyghur studies programs, after the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, it revived its Uyghur studies program as part of an &quot;ideological war&quot; against China. The term &quot;East Turkestan&quot; was popularized in academic works, but inconsistently: at times, the term East Turkestan only referred to as the area in Xinjiang south of the Tian Shan mountains, corresponding to the Tarim Basin; the areas north of the Tian Shan mountains were called Dzungaria or Zungaria. Tursun Rakhimov, a Uyghur historian for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the Sino-Soviet split, argued in his 1981 book &quot;Fate of the Non-Han Peoples of the PRC&quot; that &quot;both&quot; East Turkestan and Dzungaria were conquered by China and &quot;renamed&quot; Xinjiang. Occasionally, he used East Turkestan and Xinjiang interchangeably. Concurrently, during the Cultural Revolution and the Revolution&#x27;s campaigns against &quot;local nationalism&quot;, the government had come to associate the term East Turkestan with Uyghur separatism and &quot;&quot; and forbade its usage. Uyghur nationalist historian Turghun Almas and his book Uyghurlar (The Uyghurs) and Uyghur nationalist accounts of history were galvanized by Soviet stances on history, &quot;firmly grounded&quot; in Soviet Turcological works, and both heavily influenced and partially created by Soviet historians and Soviet works on Turkic peoples. Soviet historiography spawned the rendering of Uyghur history found in Uyghurlar. Almas claimed that Central Asia was &quot;the motherland of the Uyghurs&quot; and also the &quot;ancient golden cradle of world culture&quot;. The global trends set by the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s and the rise of global Islamism and pan-Turkism revived separatist sentiments in Xinjiang and led to a wave of political violence that killed 162 people between 1990 and 2001.

===21st century===
In 2001, the government of China lifted its ban on state media&#x27;s using the terms &quot;Uyghurstan&quot; or &quot;East Turkestan&quot;, as part of a general opening up after the September 11 attacks to the world about political violence in Xinjiang and a plea for international help to suppress East Turkestan terrorists. In 2004, the East Turkistan Government in Exile was established in Washington, D.C. under the leadership of Anwar Yusuf Turani to strive for East Turkistan&#x27;s independence. To justify the PRC&#x27;s claim to East Turkestan, a white paper was published in 2019 which made a statement that &#x27;East Turkestan&#x27; never existed and it was only called &#x27;Xinjiang&#x27; and been part of China since early history. East Turkestan was historically not treated as an inseparable part of China, but rather colonized by Han Chinese who had little in common with the Uyghur population.

On February 28, 2017, it was announced by the Qira County government in Hotan Prefecture that those who reported others for stitching the &#x27;star and crescent moon&#x27; insignia on their clothing or personal items or having the words &#x27;East Turkestan&#x27; on their mobile phone case, purse, or other jewelry, would be eligible for cash payments.

== Current status ==

As the history of Xinjiang in particular is contested between the government of China and Uyghur separatists, the official and common name of Xinjiang (with its Uyghur loanword counterpart, &quot;Shinjang&quot;) is rejected by those seeking independence. &quot;East Turkestan&quot;, a term of Russian origin, asserts a continuity with a &quot;West Turkestan&quot; or the now-independent states of Soviet Central Asia. Not all of those states accept the designation of &quot;Turkestan&quot;, however. For instance, Tajikistan&#x27;s Persian-speaking population feels more closely aligned with Iran and Afghanistan. For separatists, East Turkestan is coterminous with Xinjiang or the independent state that they would like to lead in Xinjiang. Proponents of the term &quot;East Turkestan&quot; argue that the name Xinjiang is arrogant, because if the individual Chinese characters are to be taken literally and not as a proper name, then Xinjiang means &quot;New Territory&quot;. Some Chinese scholars have advocated a name change for the region or a reversion to the older term Xiyu (&quot;Western Regions&quot;), arguing that &quot;Xinjiang&quot; might mislead people into thinking that Xinjiang is &quot;new&quot; to China. Other scholars defend the name, noting that Xinjiang was new to the late Qing dynasty, which gave Xinjiang its current name.

In modern separatist usage, &quot;Uyghuristan&quot;, which means &quot;land of the Uyghurs&quot;, is a synonym for Xinjiang or a potential state in Xinjiang, like &quot;East Turkestan&quot;. There is no consensus among separatists about whether to use &quot;East Turkestan&quot; or &quot;Uyghurstan&quot;. &quot;East Turkestan&quot; has the advantage of also being the name of two historic political entities in the region, while Uyghurstan appeals to modern ideas of ethnic self-determination. East Turkistan was also used in the context of Yaqub Beg&#x27;s Kashgaria in the mid-1800s. Uyghurstan is also a difference in emphasis in that it excludes more peoples in Xinjiang than just the Han, but the &quot;East Turkestan&quot; movement is still a Uyghur phenomenon. Kazakhs and Hui Muslims are largely alienated from the movement, as are Uyghurs who live closer to the eastern provinces of China. Separatist sentiment is strongest among the Uyghur diaspora, who practice what has been called &quot;cyber-separatism&quot;, encouraging the use of &quot;East Turkestan&quot; on their websites and literature. Historically, &quot;Uyghurstan&quot; referred to the northeastern oasis region of &quot;Kumul-Turfan&quot;. &quot;Chinese Turkestan&quot;, while synonymous with East Turkestan in historical terms, is not used today, rejected by Uyghur separatists for the &quot;Chinese&quot; part of the name and by China for the &quot;Turkestan&quot; part.
In China, the terms &quot;East Turkestan&quot;, &quot;Uyghurstan&quot;, and even &quot;Turkestan&quot; alone connote old Western imperialism and the past East Turkestan republics and modern militant groups, such as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM). The government of China conflates the violence of differing separatist groups, such as the ETIM and the East Turkestan Liberation Organization, as coming simply from &quot;East Turkestan forces&quot;. Chinese diplomatic missions have objected to foreigners&#x27; use of &quot;East Turkestan&quot;. They argue that the term is political and no longer geographical or historical and that its use represents &quot;a provocation&quot; to the sovereignty of China. The historical definitions for &quot;East Turkestan&quot; are multifarious and ambiguous, reflecting that, outside of Chinese administration, the area now called &quot;Xinjiang&quot; was not geographically or demographically a single region.

The territorial definition, as claimed by the East Turkistan Government in Exile and International Support for Uyghurs, includes the bulk of Xinjiang (excluding the disputed territory of Aksai Chin), as well as parts of western Gansu (including Subei Mongol Autonomous County, Aksay Kazakh Autonomous County, Dunhuang city, and Guazhou County) and Qinghai (Lenghu and Mangnai). The World Uyghur Congress considers East Turkestan to be the area of Xinjiang along with territory claimed to be annexed by a &quot;neighboring Chinese province&quot; in 1949.
