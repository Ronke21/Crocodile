<text>A catamaran () (informally, a &quot;cat&quot;) is a watercraft with two parallel hulls of equal size. The wide distance between a catamaran&#x27;s hulls imparts stability through resistance to rolling and overturning; no ballast is required. Catamarans typically have less hull volume, smaller displacement, and shallower draft (draught) than monohulls of comparable length. The two hulls combined also often have a smaller hydrodynamic resistance than comparable monohulls, requiring less propulsive power from either sails or motors. The catamaran&#x27;s wider stance on the water can reduce both heeling and wave-induced motion, as compared with a monohull, and can give reduced wakes.

Catamarans were invented by the Austronesian peoples, and enabled their expansion to the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

Catamarans range in size from small sailing or rowing vessels to large naval ships and roll-on/roll-off car ferries. The structure connecting a catamaran&#x27;s two hulls ranges from a simple frame strung with webbing to support the crew to a bridging superstructure incorporating extensive cabin or cargo space.

== History ==

Catamarans from Oceania and Maritime Southeast Asia became the inspiration for modern catamarans. Until the 20th century catamaran development focused primarily on sail-driven concepts.

=== Etymology ===

The word &quot;catamaran&quot; is derived from the Tamil word, &quot;kattumaram&quot; (கட்டுமரம்), which means &quot;logs bound together&quot; and is a type of single-hulled raft made of three to seven tree trunks lashed together. The term has evolved in English usage to refer to unrelated twin-hulled vessels.

=== Development in Austronesia ===
Catamaran-type vessels were an early technology of the Austronesian peoples. Early researchers like Heine-Geldern (1932) and Hornell (1943) once believed that catamarans evolved from outrigger canoes, but modern authors specializing in Austronesian cultures like Doran (1981) and Mahdi (1988) now believe it to be the opposite.

Two canoes bound together developed directly from minimal raft technologies of two logs tied together. Over time, the twin-hulled canoe form developed into the asymmetric double canoe, where one hull is smaller than the other. Eventually the smaller hull became the prototype outrigger, giving way to the single outrigger canoe, then to the reversible single outrigger canoe. Finally, the single outrigger types developed into the double outrigger canoe (or trimarans).

This would also explain why older Austronesian populations in Island Southeast Asia tend to favor double outrigger canoes, as it keeps the boats stable when tacking. But they still have small regions where catamarans and single-outrigger canoes are still used. In contrast, more distant outlying descendant populations in Oceania, Madagascar, and the Comoros, retained the twin-hull and the single outrigger canoe types, but the technology for double outriggers never reached them (although it exists in western Melanesia). To deal with the problem of the instability of the boat when the outrigger faces leeward when tacking, they instead developed the shunting technique in sailing, in conjunction with reversible single-outriggers.

Despite their being the more &quot;primitive form&quot; of outrigger canoes, they were nonetheless effective, allowing seafaring Polynesians to voyage to distant Pacific islands.

=== Western development of sailing catamarans ===
The first documented example of twin-hulled sailing craft in Europe was designed by William Petty in 1662 to sail faster, in shallower waters, in lighter wind, and with fewer crew than other vessels of the time. However, the unusual design met with skepticism and was not a commercial success.
The design remained relatively unused in the West for almost 160 years until the early 19th-century, when the Englishman Mayflower F. Crisp built a two-hulled merchant ship in Rangoon, Burma. The ship was christened &quot;Original&quot;. Crisp described it as &quot;a fast sailing fine sea boat; she traded during the monsoon between Rangoon and the Tenasserim Provinces for several years&quot;.

Later that century, the American Nathanael Herreshoff constructed a twin-hulled sailing boat of his own design (US Pat. No. 189,459). The craft, &quot;Amaryllis&quot;, raced at her maiden regatta on June 22, 1876, and performed exceedingly well. Her debut demonstrated the distinct performance advantages afforded to catamarans over the standard monohulls. It was as a result of this event, the Centennial Regatta of the New York Yacht Club, that catamarans were barred from regular sailing classes, and this remained the case until the 1970s. On June 6, 1882, three catamarans from the Southern Yacht Club of New Orleans raced a 15 nm course on Lake Pontchartrain and the winning boat in the catamaran class, &quot;Nip and Tuck&quot;, beat the fastest sloop&#x27;s time by over five minutes.

In 1916, Leonardo Torres Quevedo patented a multihull steel vessel named &quot;Binave&quot; (Twin Ship), a new type of catamaran which was constructed and tested in Bilbao (Spain) in 1918. The innovative design included two 30 HP Hispano-Suiza marine engines and could modify its configuration when sailing, positioning two rudders at the stern of each float, with the propellers also placed aft. In 1936, Eric de Bisschop built a Polynesian &quot;double canoe&quot; in Hawaii and sailed it home to a hero&#x27;s welcome in France. In 1939, he published his experiences in a book, &quot;Kaimiloa&quot;, which was translated into English in 1940.

Roland and Francis Prout experimented with catamarans in 1949 and converted their 1935 boat factory in Canvey Island, Essex (England), to catamaran production in 1954. Their &quot;Shearwater&quot; catamarans easily won races against monohulls. &quot;Yellow Bird,&quot; a 1956-built &quot;Shearwater III&quot;, raced successfully by Francis Prout in the 1960s, is in the collection of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall. Prout Catamarans, Ltd. designed a mast aft rig with the mast aft of midships to support an enlarged jib—more than twice the size of the design&#x27;s reduced mainsail; it was produced as the &quot;Snowgoose&quot; model. The claimed advantage of this sail plan was to diminish any tendency for the bows of the vessel to dig in.

In the mid-twentieth century, beachcats became a widespread category of sailing catamarans, owing to their ease of launching and mass production. In California, a maker of surfboards, Hobie Alter, produced the Hobie 14 in 1967, and two years later the larger and even more successful Hobie 16. As of 2016, the Hobie 16 was still being produced with more than 100,000 having been manufactured.

Catamarans were introduced to Olympic sailing in 1976. The two-handed Tornado catamaran was selected for the multihull discipline in the Olympic Games from 1976 through 2008. It was redesigned in 2000. The foiling Nacra 17 was used in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which were held in 2021; after the 2015 adoption of the Nacra 15 as a Youth World Championships class and as a new class for the Youth Olympic Games.

== Performance ==
Catamarans have two distinct primary performance characteristics that distinguish them from displacement monohull vessels: lower resistance to passage through the water and greater stability (initial resistance to capsize). Choosing between a monohull and catamaran configuration includes considerations of carrying capacity, speed, and efficiency.

=== Resistance ===

At low to moderate speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through water that is approximately proportional to its speed. A displacement monohull has the same relationship at low speed since resistance is almost entirely due to surface friction. When boat speed increases and waves are generated the resistance is dependent on several design factors, particularly hull displacement to length and hull separation to length ratio, it is a non trivial resistance curve with many small peaks as wave trains at various speeds combine and cancel For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, low forward resistance allows the sails to derive power from attached flow, their most efficient mode—analogous to a wing—leading to the use of wingsails in racing craft.

=== Stability ===

Catamarans rely primarily on form stability to resist heeling and capsize. Comparison of heeling stability of a rectangular-cross section monohull of beam, &quot;B&quot;, compared with two catamaran hulls of width &quot;B&quot;/2, separated by a distance, 2×&quot;B&quot;, determines that the catamaran has an initial resistance to heeling that is seven times that of the monohull. Compared with a monohull, a cruising catamaran sailboat has a high initial resistance to heeling and capsize—a fifty-footer requires four times the force to initiate a capsize than an equivalent monohull.

=== Tradeoffs ===

One measure of the trade-off between speed and carrying capacity is the displacement Froude number (FnV), compared with &quot;calm water transportation efficiency&quot;. FnV applies when the waterline length is too speed-dependent to be meaningful—as with a planing hull. It uses a reference length, the cubic root of the volumetric displacement of the hull, &quot;V&quot;, where &quot;u&quot; is the relative flow velocity between the sea and ship, and &quot;g&quot; is acceleration due to gravity:
:formula_1

&quot;Calm water transportation efficiency&quot; of a vessel is proportional to the full-load displacement and the maximum calm-water speed, divided by the corresponding power required.

Large merchant vessels have a FnV between one and zero, whereas higher-performance powered catamarans may approach 2.5, denoting a higher speed per unit volume for catamarans. Each type of vessel has a corresponding calm water transportation efficiency, with large transport ships being in the range of 100–1,000, compared with 11-18 for transport catamarans, denoting a higher efficiency per unit of payload for monohulls.

== SWATH and wave-piercing designs ==
Two advances over the traditional catamaran are the &quot;small-waterplane-area twin hull&quot; (SWATH) and the &quot;wave-piercing&quot; configuration—the latter having become a widely favored design.

SWATH reduces wave-generating resistance by moving displacement volume below the waterline, using a pair of tubular, submarine-like hulls, connected by pylons to the bridge deck with a narrow waterline cross-section. The submerged hulls are minimally affected by waves. The SWATH form was invented by Canadian Frederick G. Creed, who presented his idea in 1938 and was later awarded a British patent for it in 1946. It was first used in the 1960s and 1970s as an evolution of catamaran design for use as oceanographic research vessels or submarine rescue ships. In 1990, the US Navy commissioned the construction of a SWATH ship to test the configuration.

SWATH vessels compare with conventional powered catamarans of equivalent size, as follows:

* Larger wetted surface, which causes higher skin friction drag
* Significant reduction in wave-induced drag, with the configuration of struts and submerged hull structures
* Lower water plane area significantly reduces pitching and heaving in a seaway
* No possibility of planing
* Higher sensitivity to loading, which may bring the bridge structure closer to the water

Wave-piercing catamarans (strictly speaking they are trimarans, with a central hull and two outriggers) employ a low-buoyancy bow on each hull that is pointed at the water line and rises aft, up to a level, to allow each hull to pierce waves, rather than ride over them. This allows higher speeds through waves than for a conventional catamaran. They are distinguished from SWATH catamarans, in that the buoyant part of the hull is not tubular. The spanning bridge deck may be configured with some of the characteristics of a normal V-hull, which allows it to penetrate the crests of waves.

Wave-piercing catamaran designs have been employed for yachts, passenger ferries, and military vessels.

== Applications ==
A catamaran configuration fills a niche where speed and sea-kindliness is favored over bulk capacity. In larger vessels, this niche favors car ferries and military vessels for patrol or operation in the littoral zone.

=== Sport ===
Recreational and sport catamarans typically are designed to have a crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and full-length battens on the mainsail. Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain points of sail.

For the 33rd America&#x27;s Cup, both the defender and the challenger built long multihulls. Société Nautique de Genève, defending with team Alinghi, sailed a catamaran. The challenger, BMW Oracle Racing, used a trimaran, replacing its soft sail rig with a towering wing sail—the largest sailing wing ever built. In the waters off Valencia, Spain in February 2010, the BMW Oracle Racing trimaran with its powerful wing sail proved to be superior. This represented a break from the traditional monohulls that had always been sailed in previous America&#x27;s Cup series.

On San Francisco Bay, the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup was sailed in long AC72 catamarans (craft set by the rules for the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup). Each yacht employed hydrofoils and a wing sail. The regatta was won 9–8 by Oracle Team USA against the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, in fifteen matches because Oracle Team USA had started the regatta with a two-point penalty.

Yachting has seen the development of multihulls over in length. &quot;The Race&quot; helped precipitate this trend; it was a circumnavigation challenge which departed from Barcelona, Spain, on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2000. Because of the prize money and prestige associated with this event, four new catamarans (and two highly modified ones) over in length were built to compete. The largest, &quot;PlayStation&quot;, owned by Steve Fossett, was long and had a mast which was above the water. Virtually all of the new mega-cats were built of pre-preg carbon fiber for strength and the lowest possible weight. The top speeds of these boats can approach . The Race was won by the -long catamaran &quot;Club Med&quot; skippered by Grant Dalton. It went round the globe in 62 days at an average speed of .

Whitewater catamaran—sometimes called &quot;cata-rafts&quot;—for whitewater sports are widely spread in post-Soviet countries. They consists of two inflatable hulls connected with a lattice scaffold. The frame of the tourist catamaran can be made of both aluminum (duralumin) pipes and from felled tree trunks. The inflatable part has two layers—an airtight balloon with inflation holes and a shell made of dense tissue, protecting the balloon from mechanical damage. Advantages of such catamarans are light weight, compactness and convenience in transportation (the whole product is packed in one pack-backpack, suitable for air traffic standards) and the speed of assembly (10–15 minutes for the inflation). All-inflatable models are available in North America. A cata-raft design has been used on the Colorado River to handle heavy whitewater, yet maintain a good speed through the water.

=== Cruising ===
Cruising sailors must make trade-offs among volume, useful load, speed, and cost in choosing a boat. Choosing a catamaran offers increased speed at the expense of reduced load per unit of cost. Howard and Doane describe the following tradeoffs between cruising monohulls and catamarans: A long-distance, offshore cruising monohull may be as short as for a given crew complement and supporting supplies, whereas a cruising catamaran would need to be to achieve the same capacity. In addition to greater speed, catamarans draw less water than do monohulls— as little as —and are easier to beach. Catamarans are harder to tack and take up more space in a marina. Cruising catamarans entail added expense for having two engines and two rudders. Tarjan adds that cruising catamarans boats can maintain a comfortable per day passage, with the racing versions recording well over per day. In addition, they do not heel more than 10-12 degrees, even at full speed on a reach.

Powered cruising catamarans share many of the amenities found in a sail cruising catamaran. The saloon typically spans two hulls wherein are found the staterooms and engine compartments. As with sailing catamarans, this configuration minimizes boat motion in a seaway.

The Swiss-registered wave-piercing catamaran, &quot;Tûranor PlanetSolar&quot;, which was launched in March 2010, is the world&#x27;s largest solar powered boat. It completed a circumnavigation of the globe in 2012.

=== Passenger transport ===

The 1970s saw the introduction of catamarans as high-speed ferries, as pioneered by Westermoen Hydrofoil in Mandal, Norway, which launched the Westamaran design in 1973. The &quot;Stena Voyager&quot; was an example of a large, fast ferry, typically traveling at a speed of , although it was capable of over .

The Australian island Tasmania became the site of builders of large transport catamarans—Incat in 1977 and Austal in 1988—each building civilian ferries and naval vessels. Incat built HSC Francisco, a High-Speed trimaran that, at 58 knots, is (as of 2014) the fastest passenger ship in service.

=== Military ===
The first warship to be propelled by a steam engine, named &quot;Demologos&quot; or &quot;Fulton&quot; and built in the United States during the War of 1812, was a catamaran with a paddle wheel between her hulls.

In the early 20th Century several catamarans were built as submarine salvage ships: SMS &quot;Vulkan&quot; and SMS &quot;Cyclop&quot; of Germany, &quot;Kommuna&quot; of Russia, and &quot;Kanguro&quot; of Spain, all designed to lift stricken submarines by means of huge cranes above a moon pool between the hulls. Two Cold War-era submarine rescue ships, USS &quot;Pigeon&quot; and USS &quot;Ortolan&quot; of the US Navy, were also catamarans, but did not have the moon pool feature.

The use of catamarans as high-speed naval transport was pioneered by HMAS &quot;Jervis Bay&quot;, which was in service with the Royal Australian Navy between 1999 and 2001. The US Military Sealift Command now operates several Expeditionary Fast Transport catamarans owned by the US Navy; they are used for high speed transport of military cargo, and to get into shallow ports.

The &quot;Makar&quot;-class is a class of two large catamaran-hull survey ships built for the Indian Navy. As of 2012, one vessel, INS Makar (J31), was in service and the second was under construction.

First launched in 2004 at Shanghai, the Houbei class missile boat of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has a catamaran design to accommodate the vessel&#x27;s stealth features.

The Tuo Chiang-class corvette is a class of Taiwanese-designed fast and stealthy multi-mission wave-piercing catamaran corvettes first launched in 2014 for the Republic of China (Taiwan) Navy.

<text>Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood is a memoir by Oliver Sacks about his childhood published in 2001. The book is named after Sacks&#x27;s Uncle Dave, whom Oliver nicknamed Uncle Tungsten because he was secretary of a business named Tungstalite, which made incandescent lightbulbs with a tungsten filament. Uncle Tungsten was fascinated with tungsten and believed it was the metal of the future. According to family members, Oliver used the single nickname, Uncle Tungsten, to refer to a combination of Dave with several other individuals in the same family.

Sacks&#x27; middle name is &#x27;Wolf&#x27;, and in most European (especially Germanic, Spanish and Slavic) languages, tungsten is named &quot;Wolfram&quot;, which is the origin of the chemical symbol &quot;W&quot;.

The book combines autobiographical elements with a primer in the history and science of chemistry. However, it is not all about his youthful passion for chemistry, but also is eclectic, relating his memories of the catastrophic fire at the Crystal Palace, his terrible experiences of sadism at school, his interest in amateur chemistry, and a passing obsession with coloring his own black-and-white photographs in his home laboratory.
==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot; was generally well-received among the British press.

<doc id="195963" wikidata="Q935306" url="?curid=195963" title="ILLIAC IV">
<text>The ILLIAC IV was the first massively parallel computer. The system was originally designed to have 256 64-bit floating point units (FPUs) and four central processing units (CPUs) able to process 1 billion operations per second. Due to budget constraints, only a single &quot;quadrant&quot; with 64 FPUs and a single CPU was built. Since the FPUs all processed the same instruction – codice_1, codice_2 etc. – in modern terminology, the design would be considered to be single instruction, multiple data, or SIMD.

The concept of building a computer using an array of processors came to Daniel Slotnick while working as a programmer on the IAS machine in 1952. A formal design did not start until 1960, when Slotnick was working at Westinghouse Electric and arranged development funding under a US Air Force contract. When that funding ended in 1964, Slotnick moved to the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign and joined the Illinois Automatic Computer (ILLIAC) team. With funding from Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), they began the design of a newer concept with 256 64-bit processors instead of the original concept with 1,024 1-bit processors.

While the machine was being assembled by Burroughs, the university began building a new facility to house it. Political tension over the funding from the US Department of Defense led to the ARPA and the university fearing for the machine&#x27;s safety. When the first 64-processor quadrant of the machine was completed in 1972, it was sent to the NASA Ames Research Center in California. After three years of thorough modification to fix various flaws, ILLIAC IV was connected to the ARPANET for distributed use in November 1975, becoming the first network-available supercomputer, beating the Cray-1 by nearly 12 months.

Running at half its design speed, the one-quadrant ILLIAC IV delivered 50 MFLOP peak, making it the fastest computer in the world at that time. It is also credited with being the first large computer to use solid-state memory, as well as the most complex computer built to that date, with over 1 million gates. Generally considered a failure due to massive budget overruns, the design was instrumental in the development of new techniques and systems for programming parallel systems. In the 1980s, several machines based on ILLIAC IV concepts were successfully delivered.

==History==

===Origins===
In June 1952, Daniel Slotnick began working on the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) at Princeton University. The IAS machine featured a bit-parallel math unit that operated on 40-bit words. Originally equipped with Williams tube memory, a magnetic drum from Engineering Research Associates was later added. This drum had 80 tracks so two words could be read at a time, and each track stored 1,024 bits.

While contemplating the drum&#x27;s mechanism, Slotnik began to wonder if that was the correct way to build a computer. If the bits of a word were written serially to a single track, instead of in parallel across 40 tracks, then the data could be fed into a bit-serial computer directly from the drum bit-by-bit. The drum would still have multiple tracks and heads, but instead of gathering up a word and sending it to a single ALU, in this concept the data on each track would be read a bit at a time and sent into parallel ALUs. This would be a word-parallel, bit-serial computer.

Slotnick raised the idea at the IAS, but John von Neumann dismissed it as requiring &quot;too many tubes&quot;. Slotnick left the IAS in February 1954 to return to school for his PhD and the matter was forgotten.

===SOLOMON===
After completing his PhD and some post-doc work, Slotnick ended up at IBM. By this time, for scientific computing at least, tubes and drums had been replaced with transistors and magnetic-core memory. The idea of parallel processors working on different streams of data from a drum no longer had the same obvious appeal. Nevertheless, further consideration showed that parallel machines could still offer significant performance in some applications; Slotnick and a colleague, John Cocke (better known as the inventor of RISC), wrote a paper on the concept in 1958.

After a short time at IBM and then another at Aeronca Aircraft, Slotnick ended up at Westinghouse&#x27;s Air Arm division, which worked on radar and similar systems. Under a contract from the US Air Force&#x27;s RADC, Slotnik was able to build a team to design a system with 1,024 bit-serial ALUs, known as &quot;processing elements&quot; or PE&#x27;s. This design was given the name SOLOMON, after King Solomon, who was both very wise and had 1,000 wives.

The PE&#x27;s would be fed instructions from a single master central processing unit (CPU), the &quot;control unit&quot; or CU. SOLOMON&#x27;s CU would read instructions from memory, decode them, and then hand them off to the PE&#x27;s for processing. Each PE had its own memory for holding operands and results, the PE Memory module, or PEM. The CU could access the entire memory via a dedicated memory bus, whereas the PE&#x27;s could only access their own PEM. To allow results from one PE to be used as inputs in another, a separate network connected each PE to its eight closest neighbours.

Several testbed systems were constructed, including a 3-by-3 (9 PE) system and a 10-by-10 model with simplified PEs. During this period, some consideration was given to more complex PE designs, becoming a 24-bit parallel system that would be organized in a 256-by-32 arrangement. A single PE using this design was built in 1963. As the design work continued, the primary sponsor within the US Department of Defense was killed in an accident and no further funding was forthcoming.

Looking to continue development, Slotnik approached Livermore, who at that time had been at the forefront of supercomputer purchases. They were very interested in the design but convinced him to upgrade the current design&#x27;s fixed-point math units to true floating point, which resulted in the SOLOMON.2 design.

Livermore would not fund development, instead, they offered a contract in which they would lease the machine once it was completed. Westinghouse management considered it too risky, and shut down the team. Slotnik left Westinghouse attempting to find venture capital to continue the project, but failed. Livermore would later select the CDC STAR-100 for this role, as CDC was willing to take on the development costs.

===ILLIAC IV===
When SOLOMON ended, Slotnick joined the Illinois Automatic Computer design (ILLIAC) team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Illinois had been designing and building large computers for the U.S. Department of Defense and the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) since 1949. In 1964 the university signed a contract with ARPA to fund the effort, which became known as ILLIAC IV, since it was the fourth computer designed and created at the university. Development started in 1965, and a first-pass design was completed in 1966.

In contrast to the bit-serial concept of SOLOMON, in ILLIAC IV the PE&#x27;s were upgraded to be full 64-bit (bit-parallel) processors, using 12,000 gates and 2048-words of thin-film memory. The PEs had five 64-bit registers, each with a special purpose. One of these, RGR, was used for communicating data to neighbouring PEs, moving one &quot;hop&quot; per clock cycle. Another register, RGD, indicated whether or not that PE was currently active. &quot;Inactive&quot; PEs could not access memory, but they would pass results to neighbouring PEs using the RGR. The PEs were designed to work as a single 64-bit FPU, two 32-bit half-precision FPUs, or eight 8-bit fixed-point processors.

Instead of 1,024 PEs and a single CU, the new design had a total of 256 PEs arranged into four 64-PE &quot;quadrants&quot;, each with its own CU. The CU&#x27;s were also 64-bit designs, with sixty-four 64-bit registers and another four 64-bit accumulators. The system could run as four separate 64-PE machines, two 128-PE machines, or a single 256-PE machine. This allowed the system to work on different problems when the data was too small to demand the entire 256-PE array.

Based on a 25 MHz clock, with all 256-PEs running on a single program, the machine was designed to deliver 1 billion floating point operations per second, or in today&#x27;s terminology, 1 GFLOPS. This made it much faster than any machine in the world; the contemporary CDC 7600 had a clock cycle of 27.5 nanoseconds, or 36 MIPS, although for a variety of reasons it generally offered performance closer to 10 MIPS.

To support the machine, an extension to the Digital Computer Laboratory buildings were constructed. Sample work at the university was primarily aimed at ways to efficiently fill the PEs with data, thus conducting the first &quot;stress test&quot; in computer development. In order to make this as easy as possible, several new computer languages were created; IVTRAN and TRANQUIL were parallelized versions of FORTRAN, and Glypnir was a similar conversion of ALGOL. Generally, these languages provided support for loading arrays of data &quot;across&quot; the PEs to be executed in parallel, and some even supported the unwinding of loops into array operations.

===Construction, problems===
In early 1966, the university sent out a request for proposals looking for industrial partners interested in building the design. Seventeen responses were received in July, seven responded, and of these three were selected. Several of the responses, including Control Data, attempted to interest them in a vector processor design instead, but as these were already being designed the team was not interested in building another. In August 1966, eight-month contracts were offered to RCA, Burroughs, and Univac to bid on the construction of the machine.

Burroughs eventually won the contract, having teamed up with Texas Instruments (TI). Both offered new technical advances that made their bid the most interesting. Burroughs was offering to build a new and much faster version of thin-film memory which would improve performance. TI was offering to build 64-pin emitter-coupled logic (ECL) integrated circuits (ICs) with 20 logic gates each. At the time, most ICs used 16-pin packages and had between 4 and 7 gates. Using TI&#x27;s ICs would make the system much smaller.

Burroughs also supplied the specialized disk drives, which featured a separate stationary head for every track and could offer speeds up to 500 Mbit/s and stored about 80 MB per 36&quot; disk. They would also provide a Burroughs B6500 mainframe to act as a front-end controller, loading data from secondary storage and performing other housekeeping tasks. Connected to the B6500 was a 3rd party laser optical recording medium, a write-once system that stored up to 1 Tbit on thin metal film coated on a strip of polyester sheet carried by a rotating drum. Construction of the new design began at Burroughs&#x27; Great Valley Lab. At the time, it was estimated the machine would be delivered in early 1970.

After a year of working on the ICs, TI announced they had failed to be able to build the 64-pin designs. The more complex internal wiring was causing crosstalk in the circuitry, and they asked for another year to fix the problems. Instead, the ILLIAC team chose to redesign the machine based on available 16-pin ICs. This required the system to run slower, using a 16 MHz clock instead of the original 25 MHz. The change from 64-pin to 16-pin cost the project about two years, and millions of dollars. TI was able to get the 64-pin design working after just over another year, and began offering them on the market before ILLIAC was complete.

As a result of this change, the individual PC boards grew about square to about . This doomed Burroughs&#x27; efforts to produce a thin-film memory for the machine, because there was now no longer enough space for the memory to fit within the design&#x27;s cabinets. Attempts to increase the size of the cabinets to make room for the memory caused serious problems with signal propagation. Slotnick surveyed the potential replacements and picked a semiconductor memory from Fairchild Semiconductor, a decision that was so opposed by Burroughs that a full review by ARPA followed.

In 1969, these problems, combined with the resulting cost overruns from the delays, led to the decision to build only a single 64-PE quadrant, thereby limiting the machine&#x27;s speed to about 200 MFLOPS. Together, these changes cost the project three years and $6 million. By 1969, the project was spending $1 million a month, and had to be spun out of the original ILLIAC team who were becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition to the project.

===Move to Ames===
By 1970, the machine was finally being built at a reasonable rate and it was being readied for delivery in about a year. On 6 January 1970, &quot;The Daily Illini&quot;, the student newspaper, claimed that the computer would be used to design nuclear weapons. In May, the Kent State shootings took place, and anti-war violence erupted across university campuses.

Slotnick grew to be opposed to the use of the machine on classified research, and announced that as long as it was on the university grounds that all processing that took place on the machine would be publicly released. He also grew increasingly concerned that the machine would be subject to attack by the more radical student groups. a position that seemed wise after the local students joined the 9 May 1970 nationwide student strike by declaring a &quot;day of Illiaction&quot;, and especially the 24 August bombing of the mathematics building at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

With the help of Hans Mark, the director of the NASA Ames Research Center in what was becoming Silicon Valley, in January 1971 the decision was made to deliver the machine to Ames rather than the university. Located on an active US Navy base and protected by the U.S. Marines, security would no longer be a concern. The machine was finally delivered to Ames in April 1972, and installed in the Central Computer Facility in building N-233. By this point it was several years late and well over budget at a total price of $31 million, almost four times the original estimate of $8 million for the complete 256-PE machine.

NASA also decided to replace the B6500 front-end machine with a PDP-10, which were in common use at Ames and would make it much easier to connect to the ARPAnet. This required the development of new software, especially compilers, on the PDP-10. This caused further delays in bringing the machine online.

The Illiac IV was contracted to be managed by ACTS Computing Corporation headquartered in Southfield, MI, a Timesharing and Remote Job Entry (RJE) company that had recently been acquired by the conglomerate, Lear Siegler Corporation. The DoD contracted with ACTS under a cost plus 10% contract. This unusual arrangement was due to the constraint that no government employee could be paid more than a Congress person and many Illiac IV personnel made more than that limit. Dr. Mel Pirtle, with a background from the University of California, Berkeley and the Berkeley Computer Corporation (BCC) was engaged as the Illiac IV&#x27;s director.

===Making it work===
When the machine first arrived, it could not be made to work. It suffered from all sorts of problems from cracking PCBs, to bad resistors, to the packaging of the TI ICs being highly sensitive to humidity. These issues were slowly addressed, and by the summer of 1973 the first programs were able to be run on the system although the results were highly questionable. Starting in June 1975, a concerted four-month effort began that required, among other changes, replacing 110,000 resistors, rewiring parts to fix propagation delay issues, improving filtering in the power supplies, and a further reduction in clock speed to 13 MHz. At the end of this process, the system was finally working properly.

From then on, the system ran Monday morning to Friday afternoon, providing 60 hours of up-time for the users, but requiring 44 hours of scheduled downtime. Nevertheless, it was increasingly used as NASA programmers learned ways to get performance out of the complex system. At first, performance was dismal, with most programs running at about 15 MFLOPS, about three times the average for the CDC 7600. Over time this improved, notably after Ames programmers wrote their own version of FORTRAN, CFD, and learned how to parallel I/O into the limited PEMs. On problems that could be parallelized the machine was still the fastest in the world, outperforming the CDC 7600 by two to six times, and it is generally credited as the fastest machine in the world until 1981.

On 7 September 1981, after nearly 10 years of operation, the ILLIAC IV was turned off. The machine was officially decommissioned in 1982, and NASA&#x27;s advanced computing division ended with it. One control unit and one processing element chassis from the machine is now on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, less than a mile from its operational site.

===Aftermath===
ILLIAC was very late, very expensive, and never met its goal of producing 1 GFLOP. It was widely considered a failure even by those who worked on it; one stated simply that &quot;any impartial observer has to regard Illiac IV as a failure in a technical sense.&quot; In terms of project management it is widely regarded as a failure, running over its cost estimates by four times and requiring years of remedial efforts to make it work. As Slotnik himself later put it:

However, later analyses note that the project had several long-lasting effects on the computer market as a whole, both intentionally and unintentionally.

Among the indirect effects was the rapid update of semiconductor memory after the ILLIAC project. Slotnick received a lot of criticism when he chose Fairchild Semiconductor to produce the memory ICs, as at the time the production line was an empty room and the design existed only on paper. However, after three months of intense effort, Fairchild had a working design being produced &quot;en masse&quot;. As Slotnick would later comment, &quot;Fairchild did a magnificent job of pulling our chestnuts out of the fire. The Fairchild memories were superb and their reliability to this day is just incredibly good.&quot; ILLIAC is considered to have dealt a death blow to magnetic-core memory and related systems like thin-film.

Another indirect effect was caused by the complexity of the printed circuit boards (PCBs), or modules. At the original 25 MHz design speed, impedance in the ground wiring proved to be a serious problem, demanding that the PCBs be as small as possible. As their complexity grew, the PCBs had to add more and more layers in order to avoid growing larger. Eventually, they reached 15-layers deep, which proved to be well beyond the capabilities of draftsmen. The design was ultimately completed using new automated design tools provided by a subcontractor, and the complete design required two years of computer time on a Burroughs mainframe. This was a major step forward in computer aided design, and by the mid-1970s such tools were commonplace.

ILLIAC also led to major research into the topic of parallel processing that had wide-ranging effects. During the 1980s, with the price of microprocessors falling according to Moore&#x27;s Law, a number of companies created MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) to build even more parallel machines, with compilers that could make better use of the parallelism. The Thinking Machines CM-5 is an excellent example of the MIMD concept. It was the better understanding of parallelism on ILLIAC that led to the improved compilers and programs that could take advantage of these designs. As one ILLIAC programmer put it, &quot;If anybody builds a fast computer out of a lot of microprocessors, Illiac IV will have done its bit in the broad scheme of things.&quot;

Most supercomputers of the era took another approach to higher performance, using a single very-high-speed vector processor. Similar to the ILLIAC in some ways, these processor designs loaded up many data elements into a single custom processor instead of a large number of specialized ones. The classic example of this design is the Cray-1, which had performance similar to the ILLIAC. There was more than a little &quot;backlash&quot; against the ILLIAC design as a result, and for some time the supercomputer market looked on massively parallel designs with disdain, even when they were successful. As Seymour Cray famously quipped, &quot;If you were plowing a field, which would you rather use? Two strong oxen or 1024 chickens?&quot;

==Description==

===Physical arrangement===
Each quadrant of the machine was high, deep and long. Arranged beside the quadrant was its input/output (I/O) system, whose disk system stored 2.5 GiB and could read and write data at 1 billion bits per second, along with the B6700 computer that connected to the machine through the same 1,024-bit-wide interface as the disk system.

The machine consisted of a series of carrier chassis holding a number of the small modules. The majority of these were the Processing Units (PUs), which contained the modules for a single PE, its PEM, and the Memory Logic Unit that handled address translation and I/O. The PUs were identical, so they could be replaced or reordered as required.

===Processor details===
Each CU had about 30 to 40,000 gates. The CU had sixteen 64-bit registers and a separate sixty-four slot 64-bit &quot;scratchpad&quot;, LDB. There were four accumulators, AC0 through AC3, a program counter ILR, and various control registers. The system had a short instruction pipeline and implemented instruction look ahead.

The PEs had about 12,000 gates. It included four 64-bit registers, using an accumulator A, an operand buffer B and a secondary scratchpad S. The fourth, R, was used to broadcast or receive data from the other PEs. The PEs used a carry-lookahead adder, a leading-one detector for Boolean operations, and a barrel shifter. 64-bit additions took about 200 ns and multiplications about 400 ns. The PE&#x27;s were connected to a private memory bank, the PEM, which held 2,048 64-bit words. Access time was on the order of 250 ns The PEs used a load/store architecture.

The instruction set (ISA) contained two separate sets of instructions, one for the CU (or a unit within it, ADVAST) and another for the PEs. Instructions for the PEs were not decoded, and instead sent directly to the FINST register to be sent to the PEs to process. The ADVAST instructions were decoded and entered the CU&#x27;s processing pipeline.

===Logical arrangement===
Each quadrant contained 64 PEs and one CU. The CU had access to the entire I/O bus and could address all of the machine&#x27;s memory. The PEs could only access their own local store, the PEM, of 2,048 64-bit words. Both the PEs and CU could use load and store operations to access the disk system.

The cabinets were so large that it required 240 ns for signals to travel from one end to the other. For this reason, the CU could not be used to coordinate actions, instead, the entire system was clock-synchronous with all operations in the PEs guaranteed to take the same amount of time no matter what the operands were. That way the CU could be sure that the operations were complete without having to wait for results or status codes.

To improve the performance of operations that required the output of one PE&#x27;s results to be used as the input to another PE, the PEs were connected directly to their neighbours, as well as the ones eight-steps away - for instance, PE1 was directly connected to PE0 and PE2, as well as PE9 and PE45. The eight-away connections allowed faster transport when the data needed to travel between more distant PEs. Each shift of data moved 64-words in a single 125 ns clock cycle.

The system used a one-address format, in which the instructions included the address of one of the operands and the other operand was in the PE&#x27;s accumulator (the A register). The address was sent to the PE&#x27;s over a separate &quot;broadcast&quot; bus. Depending on the instruction, the value on the bus might refer to a memory location in the PE&#x27;s PEM, a value in one of the PE registers, or a numeric constant.

Since each PE had its own memory, while the instruction format and the CUs saw the entire address space, the system included an index register (X) to offset the base address. This allowed, for example, the same instruction stream to work on data that was not aligned in the same locations in different PEs. The common example would be an array of data that was loaded into different locations in the PEMs, which could then be made uniform by setting the index in the different PEs.

===Branches===
In traditional computer designs, instructions are loaded into the CPU one at a time as they are read from memory. Normally, when the CPU completes processing an instruction, the program counter (PC) is incremented by one word and the next instruction is read. This process is interrupted by branches, which causes the PC to jump to one of two locations depending on a test, like whether a given memory address holds a non-zero value. In the ILLIAC design, each PE would be applying this test to different values, and thus have different outcomes. Since those values are private to the PE, the following instructions would need to be loaded based on a value only the PE knew.

To avoid the delays reloading the PE instructions would cause, the ILLIAC loaded the PEMs with the instructions on both sides of the branch. Logical tests did not change the PC, instead, they set &quot;mode bits&quot; that told the PE whether or not to run the next arithmetic instruction. To use this system, the program would be written so that one of the two possible instruction streams followed the test, and ended with an instruction to invert the bits. Code for the second branch would then follow, ending with an instruction to set all the bits to 1.

If the test selected the &quot;first&quot; branch, that PE would continue on as normal. When it reached the end of that code, the mode operator instruction would flip the mode bits, and from then on that PE would ignore further instructions. This would continue until it reached the end of the code for the second branch, where the mode reset instruction would turn the PE back on. If a particular PE&#x27;s test resulted in the second branch being taken, it would instead set the mode bits to ignore further instructions until it reached the end of the first branch, where the mode operator would flip the bits and cause the second branch to begin processing, once again turning them all on at the end of that branch.

Since the PEs can operate in 64-, 32- and 8-bit modes, the mode flags had multiple bits so the individual words could be turned on or off. For instance, in the case when the PE was operating in 32-bit mode, one &quot;side&quot; of the PE might have the test come out true while the other side was false.

<text>In electronics, a relaxation oscillator is a nonlinear electronic oscillator circuit that produces a nonsinusoidal repetitive output signal, such as a triangle wave or square wave. The circuit consists of a feedback loop containing a switching device such as a transistor, comparator, relay, op amp, or a negative resistance device like a tunnel diode, that repetitively charges a capacitor or inductor through a resistance until it reaches a threshold level, then discharges it again. The period of the oscillator depends on the time constant of the capacitor or inductor circuit. The active device switches abruptly between charging and discharging modes, and thus produces a discontinuously changing repetitive waveform. This contrasts with the other type of electronic oscillator, the harmonic or linear oscillator, which uses an amplifier with feedback to excite resonant oscillations in a resonator, producing a sine wave.

Relaxation oscillators may be used for a wide range of frequencies, but as they are one of the oscillator types suited to low frequencies, below audio, they are typically used for applications such as blinking lights (turn signals) and electronic beepers, as well as voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters, switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters, and function generators.

The term &quot;relaxation oscillator&quot;, though often used in electronics engineering, is also applied to dynamical systems in many diverse areas of science that produce nonlinear oscillations and can be analyzed using the same mathematical model as electronic relaxation oscillators. For example, geothermal geysers, networks of firing nerve cells, thermostat controlled heating systems, coupled chemical reactions, the beating human heart, earthquakes, the squeaking of chalk on a blackboard, the cyclic populations of predator and prey animals, and gene activation systems have been modeled as relaxation oscillators. Relaxation oscillations are characterized by two alternating processes on different time scales: a long relaxation period during which the system approaches an equilibrium point, alternating with a short impulsive period in which the equilibrium point shifts. The period of a relaxation oscillator is mainly determined by the relaxation time constant. Relaxation oscillations are a type of limit cycle and are studied in nonlinear control theory.

==Electronic relaxation oscillators==

The first relaxation oscillator circuit, the astable multivibrator, was invented by Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch using vacuum tubes during World War I. Balthasar van der Pol first distinguished relaxation oscillations from harmonic oscillations, originated the term &quot;relaxation oscillator&quot;, and derived the first mathematical model of a relaxation oscillator, the influential Van der Pol oscillator model, in 1920. Van der Pol borrowed the term &quot;relaxation&quot; from mechanics; the discharge of the capacitor is analogous to the process of &quot;stress relaxation&quot;, the gradual disappearance of deformation and return to equilibrium in an inelastic medium. 
Relaxation oscillators can be divided into two classes
*Sawtooth, sweep, or flyback oscillator: In this type the energy storage capacitor is charged slowly but discharged rapidly, essentially instantly, by a short circuit through the switching device. Thus there is only one &quot;ramp&quot; in the output waveform which takes up virtually the entire period. The voltage across the capacitor approximates a sawtooth wave, while the current through the switching device is a sequence of short pulses.
*Astable multivibrator: In this type the capacitor is both charged and discharged slowly through a resistor, so the output waveform consists of two parts, an increasing ramp and a decreasing ramp. The voltage across the capacitor approximates a triangle waveform, while the current through the switching device approximates a square wave.
Before the advent of microelectronics, simple relaxation oscillators often used a negative resistance device with hysteresis such as a thyratron tube, neon lamp, or unijunction transistor, however today they are more often built with dedicated integrated circuits such as the 555 timer chip.

===Applications===
Relaxation oscillators are generally used to produce low frequency signals for such applications as blinking lights and electronic beepers. During the vacuum tube era they were used as oscillators in electronic organs and horizontal deflection circuits and time bases for CRT oscilloscopes; one of the most common was the Miller integrator circuit invented by Alan Blumlein, which used vacuum tubes as a constant current source to produce a very linear ramp. They are also used in voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters and switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters, and in function generators to produce square and triangle waves. Relaxation oscillators are widely used because they are easier to design than linear oscillators, are easier to fabricate on integrated circuit chips because they do not require inductors like LC oscillators, and can be tuned over a wide frequency range. However they have more phase noise and poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.

== Pearson–Anson oscillator ==

This example can be implemented with a capacitive or resistive-capacitive integrating circuit driven respectively by a constant current or voltage source, and a threshold device with hysteresis (neon lamp, thyratron, diac, reverse-biased bipolar transistor, or unijunction transistor) connected in parallel to the capacitor. The capacitor is charged by the input source causing the voltage across the capacitor to rise. The threshold device does not conduct at all until the capacitor voltage reaches its threshold (trigger) voltage. It then increases heavily its conductance in an avalanche-like manner because of the inherent positive feedback, which quickly discharges the capacitor. When the voltage across the capacitor drops to some lower threshold voltage, the device stops conducting and the capacitor begins charging again, and the cycle repeats ad infinitum.

If the threshold element is a neon lamp, the circuit also provides a flash of light with each discharge of the capacitor. This lamp example is depicted below in the typical circuit used to describe the Pearson–Anson effect. The discharging duration can be extended by connecting an additional resistor in series to the threshold element. The two resistors form a voltage divider; so, the additional resistor has to have low enough resistance to reach the low threshold.

=== Alternative implementation with 555 timer ===

A similar relaxation oscillator can be built with a 555 timer IC (acting in astable mode) that takes the place of the neon bulb above. That is, when a chosen capacitor is charged to a design value, (e.g., 2/3 of the power supply voltage) comparators within the 555 timer flip a transistor switch that gradually discharges that capacitor through a chosen resistor (which determine the RC time constant) to ground. At the instant the capacitor falls to a sufficiently low value (e.g., 1/3 of the power supply voltage), the switch flips to let the capacitor charge up again. The popular 555&#x27;s comparator design permits accurate operation with any supply from 5 to 15 volts or even wider.

Other, non-comparator oscillators may have unwanted timing changes if the supply voltage changes.

== Inductive oscillator == 

A blocking oscillator using the inductive properties of a pulse transformer to generate square waves by driving the transformer into saturation, which then cuts the transformer supply current until the transformer unloads and desaturates, which then triggers another pulse of supply current, generally using a single transistor as the switching element.

== Comparator–based relaxation oscillator ==
Alternatively, when the capacitor reaches each threshold, the charging source can be switched from the positive power supply to the negative power supply or vice versa. The earlier inverting Schmitt trigger animated example operates on the same principle (since the Schmitt trigger internally performs comparison). This section will analyze a similar implementation using a comparator as a discrete component.

This relaxation oscillator is a hysteretic oscillator, named this way because of the hysteresis created by the positive feedback loop implemented with the comparator (similar to an operational amplifier). A circuit that implements this form of hysteretic switching is known as a Schmitt trigger. Alone, the trigger is a bistable multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable multivibrator into an astable multivibrator.

=== General concept ===
The system is in unstable equilibrium if both of the inputs and the output of the comparator are at zero volts. The moment any sort of noise, be it thermal or electromagnetic noise brings the output of the comparator above zero (the case of the comparator output going below zero is also possible, and a similar argument to what follows applies), the positive feedback in the comparator results in the output of the comparator saturating at the positive rail.

In other words, because the output of the comparator is now positive, the non-inverting input to the comparator is also positive, and continues to increase as the output increases, due to the voltage divider. After a short time, the output of the comparator is the positive voltage rail, formula_1.

The inverting input and the output of the comparator are linked by a series RC circuit. Because of this, the inverting input of the comparator asymptotically approaches the comparator output voltage with a time constant RC. At the point where voltage at the inverting input is greater than the non-inverting input, the output of the comparator falls quickly due to positive feedback.

This is because the non-inverting input is less than the inverting input, and as the output continues to decrease, the difference between the inputs gets more and more negative. Again, the inverting input approaches the comparator&#x27;s output voltage asymptotically, and the cycle repeats itself once the non-inverting input is greater than the inverting input, hence the system oscillates.

=== Example: Differential equation analysis of a comparator-based relaxation oscillator ===

formula_2 is set by formula_3 across a resistive voltage divider:

:formula_4

formula_5 is obtained using Ohm&#x27;s law and the capacitor differential equation:

:formula_6

Rearranging the formula_5 differential equation into standard form results in the following:

:formula_8

Notice there are two solutions to the differential equation, the driven or particular solution and the homogeneous solution. Solving for the driven solution, observe that for this particular form, the solution is a constant. In other words, formula_9 where A is a constant and formula_10.

:formula_11

:formula_12

Using the Laplace transform to solve the homogeneous equation formula_13 results in

:formula_14

formula_15 is the sum of the particular and homogeneous solution.

:formula_16

:formula_17

Solving for B requires evaluation of the initial conditions. At time 0, formula_18 and formula_19. Substituting into our previous equation,

:formula_20

:formula_21

==== Frequency of oscillation ====
First let&#x27;s assume that formula_22 for ease of calculation. Ignoring the initial charge up of the capacitor, which is irrelevant for calculations of the frequency, note that charges and discharges oscillate between formula_23 and formula_24. For the circuit above, Vss must be less than 0. Half of the period (T) is the same as time that formula_25 switches from Vdd. This occurs when V− charges up from formula_26 to formula_23.

:formula_16

:formula_29

:formula_30

:formula_31

:formula_32

:formula_33

When Vss is not the inverse of Vdd we need to worry about asymmetric charge up and discharge times. Taking this into account we end up with a formula of the form:

:formula_34

Which reduces to the above result in the case that formula_22.

<text>Diagnosis-related group (DRG) is a system to classify hospital cases into one of originally 467 groups, with the last group (coded as 470 through v24, 999 thereafter) being &quot;Ungroupable&quot;. This system of classification was developed as a collaborative project by Robert B Fetter, PhD, of the Yale School of Management, and John D. Thompson, MPH, of the Yale School of Public Health. The system is also referred to as &quot;the DRGs&quot;, and its intent was to identify the &quot;products&quot; that a hospital provides. One example of a &quot;product&quot; is an appendectomy. The system was developed in anticipation of convincing Congress to use it for reimbursement, to replace &quot;cost based&quot; reimbursement that had been used up to that point. DRGs are assigned by a &quot;grouper&quot; program based on ICD (International Classification of Diseases) diagnoses, procedures, age, sex, discharge status, and the presence of complications or comorbidities. DRGs have been used in the US since 1982 to determine how much Medicare pays the hospital for each &quot;product&quot;, since patients within each category are clinically similar and are expected to use the same level of hospital resources. DRGs may be further grouped into Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs). DRGs are also standard practice for establishing reimbursements for other Medicare related reimbursements such as to home healthcare providers.

==Purpose==
The original objective of diagnosis-related groups (DRG) was to develop a classification system that identified the &quot;products&quot; that the patient received. Since the introduction of DRGs in the early 1980s, the healthcare industry has evolved and developed an increased demand for a patient classification system that can serve its original objective at a higher level of sophistication and precision. To meet those evolving needs, the objective of the DRG system had to expand in scope.

Several different DRG systems have been developed in the United States. They include:
* Medicare DRG (CMS-DRG &amp; MS-DRG)
* Refined DRGs (R-DRG)
* All Patient DRGs (AP-DRG)
* Severity DRGs (S-DRG)
* All Patient, Severity-Adjusted DRGs (APS-DRG)
* All Patient Refined DRGs (APR-DRG)
* International-Refined DRGs (IR-DRG)

Other DRG systems have been developed for markets such as Latin America and ASIA, for example:
* AVEDIAN DRG Grouper (LAT-GRC)

== Statistics ==
As of 2003, the top 10 DRGs accounted for almost 30% of acute hospital admissions.

In 1991, the top 10 DRGs overall were: normal newborn (vaginal delivery), heart failure, psychoses, Caesarean section, neonate with significant problems, angina pectoris, specific cerebrovascular disorders, pneumonia, and hip/knee replacement. These DRGs comprised nearly 30 percent of all hospital discharges.

In terms of geographic variation, as of 2011 hospital payments varied across 441 labor markets.

==History==
The system was created in the early 1970s by Robert Barclay Fetter and John D. Thompson at Yale University with the material support of the former Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), now called the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).

DRGs were first implemented in New Jersey, beginning in 1980 at the initiative of NJ Health Commissioner Joanne Finley with a small number of hospitals partitioned into three groups according to their budget positions — surplus, breakeven, and deficit — prior to the imposition of DRG payment. The New Jersey experiment continued for three years, with additional cadres of hospitals being added to the number of institutions each year until all hospitals in New Jersey were dealing with this prospective payment system.

DRGs were designed to be homogeneous units of hospital activity to which binding prices could be attached. A central theme in the advocacy of DRGs was that this reimbursement system would, by constraining the hospitals, oblige their administrators to alter the behaviour of the physicians and surgeons comprising their medical staffs. Hospitals were forced to leave the &quot;nearly risk-free world of cost reimbursement&quot; and face the uncertain financial consequences associated with the provision of health care. DRGs were designed to provide practice pattern information that administrators could use to influence individual physician behaviour.

DRGs were intended to describe all types of patients in an acute hospital setting. DRGs encompassed elderly patients as well as new born, pediatric and adult populations.

The prospective payment system implemented as DRGs had been designed to limit the share of hospital revenues derived from the Medicare program budget. In 1982 the US Congress passed Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act with provisions to reform Medicare payment, and in 1983, an amendment was passed to use DRGs for Medicare, with HCFA (now CMS) maintaining the definitions.

In 1987, New York state passed legislation instituting DRG-based payments for all non-Medicare patients. This legislation required that the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) evaluate the applicability of Medicare DRGs to a non-Medicare population. This evaluation concluded that the Medicare DRGs were not adequate for a non-Medicare population. Based on this evaluation, the NYS DOH entered into an agreement with 3M to research and develop all necessary DRG modifications. The modifications resulted in the initial APDRG, which differed from the Medicare DRG in that it provided support for transplants, high-risk obstetric care, nutritional disorders, and pediatrics along with support for other populations. One challenge in working with the APDRG groupers is that there is no set of common data/formulas that is shared across all states as there is with CMS. Each state maintains its own information.

The history, design, and classification rules of the DRG system, as well as its application to patient discharge data and updating procedures, are presented in the CMS &quot;DRG Definitions Manual&quot; (Also known as the &quot;Medicare DRG Definitions Manual&quot; and the &quot;Grouper Manual&quot;). A new version generally appears every October. The 20.0 version appeared in 2002.

In 2007, author Rick Mayes described DRGs as:

== United States state-based usage ==
DRGs were originally developed in New Jersey before the federal adoption for Medicare in 1983. After the federal adoption, the system was adopted by states, including in Medicaid payment systems, with twenty states using some DRG-based system in 1991; however, these systems may have their own unique adjustments.

In 1992, New Jersey repealed the DRG payment system after political controversy.

== Example calculation ==
== DRG changes ==

== International ==
DRGs and similar systems have expanded internationally; for example, in Europe some countries imported the scheme from US or Australia, and in other cases they were developed independently. In England, a similar set of codes exist called Health Resource Groups. As of 2018, Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and Thailand have limited adoption of DRGs.
Latin American countries use a DRG system adapted to regionally extended medical classifications and nomenclatures. This DRG system is called AVEDIAN DRG GROUPER (LAT-GRC).

<doc id="195973" wikidata="Q2525701" url="?curid=195973" title="Islamic–Jewish relations">
<text>Religious ties between Muslims and the Jewish people have existed since the founding of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century; Muhammad&#x27;s views on Jews were shaped by his extensive contact with the Jewish tribes of Arabia during his lifetime. Islam shares similar values, guidelines, and principles with the Jewish religion, and also incorporates Jewish history as a part of its own. Muslims regard the Israelites, to whom Jews and Samaritans trace their ethnic ancestry, as an important religious concept; they are referenced around 43 times in the Quran, excluding individual prophets, and in many accounts of hadith. Similarly, Moses, the most important Jewish prophet, is also regarded by Muslims as an Islamic prophet and messenger (see: Moses in Islam); his name is mentioned in the Quran 136 times—more than any other individual—and his life is narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet. The Torah, which is the compilation of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, is also held by Muslims as an Islamic holy book that was revealed by God (or Allah) through various Israelite prophets and messengers (see: Torah in Islam). Later rabbinic authorities and Jewish scholars, such as Maimonides, engaged in discussions concerning the relationship between Islam and Jewish religious law. Maimonides himself, it has been argued, was influenced by Islamic legal thought while living in the caliphates of his time.

Although the origins of Judaism go back to the time of the ancient Hebrews, it is considered to have started becoming a distinct religion in its own right in the Kingdom of Judah, where it developed as a strictly monotheistic outgrowth of Yahwism. Thus, with a difference of at least 2,000 years, Judaism and Islam share a common geographical origin in what is known today as the Middle East, with the former from the Southern Levant and the latter from the Hejaz. Additionally, both religions claim Abraham as their spiritual patriarch and are thereby classified as Abrahamic religions. Islam was strongly influenced by Judaism in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence, and practice. Because of this similarity, as well as through the influence of Islamic culture and philosophy on the Jewish populations in the Muslim world, there has been considerable and continued physical, theological, and political overlap between the two religions since Islam&#x27;s founding. Notably, the first Islamic Waqf was donated by a Jew named Mukhayriq, who was a rabbi in the city of Medina. In 1027, the Jewish polymath Samuel ibn Naghrillah became top advisor and military general of the Taifa of Granada in the Muslim-controlled Iberian Peninsula.

The Jewish people are among the three original &quot;People of the Book&quot; of Islam, which recognizes them, Christians, and Sabians as followers of the pre-Islamic revelations of Allah. Ties between the two communities have been marked by periods of cooperation, of ambivalence, and of open conflict. The early Muslims fought battles with a number of the Jewish tribes of Arabia, such as the Banu Qurayza, and Jews were persecuted at times under Muslim rule in subsequent centuries. Most recently, the Arab–Israeli conflict has resulted in heightened tensions between the Jewish world and the Muslim world, including the perpetuation of antisemitism and Islamophobia.

==Religious figures==


The term &quot;Semitic&quot; is due to the legendary derivation of the peoples so called from Shem, son of Noah (Genesis 10:1). Hebreaic and Arabian peoples are generally classified as Semitic, a racialist concept derived from Biblical accounts of the origins of the cultures known to the ancient Hebrews. Those closest to them in culture and language were generally deemed to be descended from their forefather Shem, one of the sons of Noah. Enemies were often said to be descendants of his cursed nephew Canaan, grandson of Noah, son of Ham. Modern historians confirm the affinity of ancient Hebrews and Arabs based on characteristics that are usually transmitted from parent to child, such as genes and habits, with the most well-studied criterion being language. Similarities between Semitic languages (including Hebrew and Arabic) and their differences with those spoken by other adjacent people confirm the common origin of Hebrews and Arabs among other Semitic nations.

Around the 12th century BC, Judaism developed as a monotheistic religion. According to Jewish religious tradition, the history of Judaism begins with the Covenant between God and Abraham, who is considered a Hebrew. (The first Hebrew being Eber, a forefather of Abraham.) The Hebrew Bible occasionally refers to &quot;Arvi&quot; peoples (or variants thereof), translated as &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Arabian&quot; deriving from &quot;Arava&quot; plain, the dwellers of plains. Some Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula are considered descendants of Ismael, the first son of Abraham. While the commonly held view among historians is that Islam originated in Arabia in the 7th century AD, in Islam&#x27;s view, Adam was the first Muslim (in the sense of believing in Allah and surrendering to Allah&#x27;s commands). Islam also shares many traits with Judaism (as well as with Christianity), like the belief in and reverence for common prophets, such as Moses and Abraham, who are recognized in all three Abrahamic religions.

===Abraham===
Judaism and Islam are known as &quot;Abrahamic religions&quot;. The first Abrahamic religion was Judaism as practiced in the wilderness of the Sinai peninsula subsequent to the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt and continuing as the Hebrews entered the land of Canaan to conquer and settle it. The kingdom eventually split into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah prior to the Babylonian Exile, at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. The firstborn son of Abraham, Ishmael, is considered by Muslims to be the &quot;Father of the Arabs&quot;. Abraham&#x27;s second son Isaac is called &quot;Father of the Hebrews&quot;. In Islamic tradition Isaac is viewed as the grandfather of all Israelites and the promised son of Ibraham from his barren wife Sarah. In the Hadith, Muhammad says that some twenty five thousand prophets and messengers came from Abraham&#x27;s seed, most of these being from Isaac, and that the last one in this line was Jesus. In the Jewish tradition Abraham is called &quot;Avraham Avinu&quot; or &quot;Our Father Abraham&quot;. For Muslims, he is considered an important prophet of Islam (see &quot;Ibrahim&quot;) and the ancestor of Muhammad through Ishmael. Ibrahim is regarded as one of the prophets of Islam alongside Noah, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, among others. The narrative of his life in the Quran is similar to that seen in the Tanakh.

===Moses===
As in Judaism and Christianity, Moses is regarded in Islam as one of the most prominent prophets. His story is frequently recounted in both the Meccan and Medinan chapters, some of which are long. Although there are differences in the Quranic and Biblical accounts, the remaining narratives are similar. They agree on the events of Moses&#x27; infancy, exile to Midian, plagues and miracles, deliverage of the Israelites, parting of the Red Sea, the revelation of the tablets, the incident of the Golden Calf and the 40 years of wandering.

According to Noegel and Wheeler some scholars think there is a parallel between the status of Aaron in Moses&#x27; narrative and Umar in the narrative of Muhammad. In both the Biblical and Quranic accounts, Moses is accompanied by Aaron. In both accounts Moses is portrayed more actively. The Quranic and Biblical accounts differ on the nus of responsibility for the Golden Calf incident. The Bible accuses Aaron, whereas the Quranic narrative defends him.

===Muhammad===
In the course of Muhammad&#x27;s proselytizing in Mecca, he initially viewed Christians and Jews (both of whom he referred to as &quot;People of the Book&quot;) as natural allies, sharing the core principles of his teachings, and anticipated their acceptance and support. Ten years after his first revelation in Mount Hira, a delegation consisting of the representatives of the twelve important clans of Medina pledged to physically protect Muhammad and invited him as a neutral outsider to Medina to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community, which had been fighting with each other for around a hundred years and was in need of an authority.

Among the things Muhammad did in order to settle down the longstanding grievances among the tribes of Medina was drafting a document known as the Constitution of Medina. The community defined in the Constitution of Medina had a religious outlook but was also shaped by the practical considerations and substantially preserved the legal forms of the old Arab tribes. Muhammad also adopted some features of the Jewish worship and customs such as fasting on the Yom Kippur day. According to Alford Welch, the Jewish practice of having three daily prayer rituals appears to have been a factor in the introduction of the Islamic midday prayer, but Muhammad&#x27;s adoption of facing north toward Jerusalem, Islam&#x27;s first Qiblah or direction of prayer (later changed to facing toward the Kabah in Mecca), when performing the daily prayers, was practiced among other groups in Arabia.

Many Medinans converted to the faith of the Meccan immigrants, particularly pagan and polytheist tribes, but there were fewer Jewish converts. The Jews rejected Muhammad&#x27;s claim to prophethood, and further argued that some passages in the Qur&#x27;an contradicted the Torah. Their opposition was due to political as well as religious reasons, as many Jews in Medina had close links with Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, who was partial to the Jews and would have been Medina&#x27;s prince if not for Muhammad&#x27;s arrival.

Mark Cohen adds that Muhammad appeared &quot;centuries after the cessation of biblical prophecy&quot; and &quot;couched his message in a verbiage foreign to Judaism both in its format and rhetoric.&quot; Maimonides, a Jewish scholar, referred to Muhammad as a false prophet. Moreover, Maimonides asserted that Muhammad&#x27;s claim to prophethood was in itself what disqualified him, because it contradicted the prophecy of Moses, the Torah and the Oral Tradition. His argument further asserted that Muhammad being illiterate also disqualified him from being a prophet.

In the Constitution of Medina, Jews were given equality to Muslims in exchange for political loyalty and were allowed to practice their own culture and religion. A significant narrative symbolising the inter-faith harmony between early Muslims and Jews is that of the Rabbi Mukhayriq. The Rabbi was from Banu Nadir and fought alongside Muslims at the Battle of Uhud and bequeathed his entire wealth to Muhammad in the case of his death. He was subsequently called &quot;the best of the Jews&quot; by Muhammad. Later, as Muhammad encountered opposition from the Jews, Muslims began to adopt a more negative view on the Jews, seeing them as something of a fifth column. Jewish violations of the Constitution of Medina, by aiding the enemies of the community, finally brought on major battles of Badr and Uhud which resulted in Muslim victories and the exile of the Banu Qainuqa and Banu Nadir, two of the main three Jewish tribes from Medina, and the mass slaughtering of all male adults of Banu Qurayza.

===Other prophets===
Both Judaism and Islam regard many people as being prophets, with exceptions.
Both teach that Eber, Job, and Joseph were prophets. However, according to one sage in Judaism the whole story attributed to Job was an allegory and Job never actually existed. Rashi, a Jewish commentator on the Hebrew Scriptures, quotes a text dating to 160 AD, which is also quoted in the Talmud, in his commentary on Genesis 10 to show that Eber was a prophet.

==Historical interaction==

Jews have often lived in predominantly Islamic nations. Since many national borders have changed over the fourteen centuries of Islamic history, a single community, such as the Jewish community in Cairo, may have been contained in a number of different nations over different periods.

===Middle Ages===
In the Iberian Peninsula, under Muslim rule, Jews were able to make great advances in mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology. This era is sometimes referred to as the Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula.

Traditionally Jews living in Muslim lands, known (along with Christians) as dhimmis, were allowed to practice their religion and to administer their internal affairs but subject to certain conditions. They had to pay the jizya (a per capita tax imposed on free, adult non-Muslim males) to the Muslim government but were exempted from paying the zakat (a tax imposed on free, adult Muslim males). Dhimmis were prohibited from bearing arms or giving testimony in most Muslim court cases, for there were many Sharia laws which did not apply to Dhimmis, who practiced Halakha. A common misconception is that of the requirement of distinctive clothing, which is a law not taught by the Qur&#x27;an or hadith but allegedly invented by the Abbasid Caliphate in early medieval Baghdad. Jews rarely faced martyrdom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and they were mostly free in their choice of residence and profession. They did, however, have certain restrictions placed upon them, listed in the Pact of Umar. The Pact of Umar was a set of guidelines placed upon Jews in Islamic territories, many of them being very restrictive and prohibitive. However, compared to Jews of Western Christendom at the time, Jews under Islamic rule were generally treated with more compassion and understanding, rather than violence and abhorrence. This period of relative tolerance, political advancement and cultural peacefulness is a time that is referred to as a golden age. As Jews advanced the social ladder, they also gained economic status and power. Many Jews had their own businesses and were even ranking officials within the government. However, Jews still experienced tense and violent times – they were often discriminated against and, as a result, were often the recipient of many violent acts placed upon them. The notable examples of massacre of Jews include the killing or forcible conversion of them by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in Al-Andalus in the 12th century. Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters (mellahs) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century. Most conversions were voluntary and happened for various reasons. However, there were some forced conversions in the 12th century under the Almohad dynasty of North Africa and al-Andalus as well as in Persia.

The medieval Volga state of Khazaria converted to Judaism, whereas its subject Volga Bulgaria converted to Islam.

===Conversion of Jews to Islam===

According to Judaism, Jews that voluntarily convert to Islam commit a treacherous act of heresy in abandoning the Torah. There is a view, held by the Radvaz and Ritva, that a Jew should be prepared to take his own life rather than convert to another religion, but the Rambam, also known as Maimonides, expresses that it is not necessary that a Jew take his own life if he is forced to convert but privately follows the Torah.

Islam accepts converts, and spreading Dawah to other religious adherents including Jews.

In modern times, some notable converts to Islam from a Jewish background include Muhammad Asad (b. Leopold Weiss), Abdallah Schleifer (b. Marc Schleifer), Youssef Darwish, Layla Morad and Maryam Jameelah (b. Margret Marcus). More than 200 Israeli Jews converted to Islam between 2000 and 2008.
Historically, in accordance with traditional Islamic law, Jews generally enjoyed freedom of religion in Islamic states as People of the Book. However, certain rulers did historically enact forced conversions for political reasons and religious reasons in regards to youth and orphans. A number of groups who converted from Judaism to Islam have remained Muslim, while maintaining a connection to and interest in their Jewish heritage. These groups include the &quot;anusim&quot; or Daggataun of Timbuktu who converted in 1492, when Askia Muhammed came to power in Timbuktu and decreed that Jews must convert to Islam or leave, and the &quot;Chala&quot;, a portion of the Bukharan Jewish community who were pressured and many times forced to convert to Islam.

In Persia, during the Safavid dynasty of the 16th and 17th centuries, Jews were forced to proclaim publicly that they had converted to Islam, and were given the name &quot;Jadid-al-Islam&quot; (New Muslims). In 1661, an Islamic edict was issued overturning these forced conversions, and the Jews returned to practicing Judaism openly. Jews in Yemen also had to face oppression, during which persecution reached its climax in the 17th century when nearly all Jewish communities in Yemen were given the choice of either converting to Islam or of being banished to a remote desert area, and which later became known as the Mawza Exile. Similarly, to end a pogrom in 1839, the Jews of Mashhad were forced to convert &quot;en masse&quot; to Islam. They practiced Judaism secretly for over a century before openly returning to their faith. At the turn of the 21st century, around 10,000 lived in Israel, another 4,000 in New York City, and 1,000 elsewhere. (See Allahdad incident.)

In Turkey, the claimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi was forced to convert to Islam in 1668. Most of his followers abandoned him, but several thousand converted to Islam as well, while continuing to see themselves as Jews. They became known as the Dönmeh (a Turkish word for a religious convert). Some Dönmeh remain today, primarily in Turkey.

===Conversion of Muslims to Judaism===
Judaism does not proselytize, and often discourages conversion to Judaism; maintaining that all people have a covenant with God, and instead encourages non-Jews to uphold the Seven Laws which it believes were given to Noah. Conversions to Judaism are therefore relatively rare, including those from the Islamic world. One famous Muslim who converted to Judaism was Ovadyah, famous from his contact with Maimonides. Reza Jabari, an Iranian flight attendant who hijacked the air carrier Kish Air flight 707 between Tehran and the resort of Kish Island in September 1995, and landed in Israel converted to Judaism after serving four-and-a-half years in an Israeli prison. He settled among Iranian Jews in the Israeli Red Sea resort town of Eilat. Another such case includes Avraham Sinai, a former Hezbollah fighter who, after the Israel–Lebanon War ended, fled to Israel and converted from Islam to become a religious and practicing Jew.

===Contemporary era===
Iran contains the largest number of Jews within predominantly Muslim countries and Uzbekistan and Turkey have the next largest communities. Iran&#x27;s Jewish community is officially recognized as a religious minority group by the government, and, like the Zoroastrians, they were allocated a seat in the Iranian parliament. In 2000, it was estimated that at that time there were still 30,000–35,000 Jews in Iran; other sources put the figure as low as 20,000–25,000. They cannot emigrate out of Iran, since the government only allows one family member to leave and be out of the country at a time. A Jewish businessman was hanged for helping Jews emigrate.

In present times, the Arab–Israeli conflict is a defining event in the relationship between Muslims and Jews. The State of Israel was proclaimed on 14 May 1948, one day before the expiry of the British Mandate of Palestine. Not long after, five Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq—attacked Israel, launching the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. After almost a year of fighting, a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders, known as the Green Line, were instituted. Jordan annexed what became known as the West Bank and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip. Israel was admitted as a member of the United Nations on 11 May 1949. During the course of the hostilities, 711,000 Arabs, according to UN estimates, fled or were expelled. The following decades saw a similar Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries where 800,000–1,000,000 Jews were forcibly expelled or fled from Arab nations due to persecution.

====Interfaith activities====
The Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek has argued that the term &quot;Judeo-Muslim&quot; to describe the middle-east culture against the western Christian culture would be more appropriate in these days, claiming as well a reduced influence from the Jewish culture on the western world due to the historical persecution and exclusion of the Jewish minority. (Though there is also a different perspective on Jewish contributions and influence.)

A &quot;Judaeo-Christian-Muslim&quot; concept thus refers to the three main monotheistic religions, commonly known as the Abrahamic religions. Formal exchanges between the three religions, modeled on the decades-old Jewish–Christian interfaith dialogue groups, became common in American cities following the 1993 Israeli–Palestinian Oslo accords.

The governments of Jordan and Qatar have been particularly active in fostering dialogue between Muslims and Jews, through conferences and institutes.

Following 9/11, there was a breakdown in interfaith dialogue that included mosques, due to the increased attention to Islamic sermons in American mosques, that revealed &quot;anti-Jewish and anti-Israel outbursts by previously respected Muslim clerics and community leaders.&quot; 

One of the country&#x27;s most prominent mosques is the New York Islamic Cultural Center, built with funding from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia. Its imam, Mohammad Al-Gamei&#x27;a, disappeared two days after 9/11.
Since 2007, the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, led by Rabbi Marc Schneier and Russell Simmons has made improving Muslim–Jewish relations their main focus. They have hosted the National Summit of Imams and Rabbis in 2007, the Gathering of Muslim and Jewish Leaders in Brussels in 2010 and in Paris in 2012, and three Missions of Muslim and Jewish Leaders to Washington D.C.. Each November the Foundation hosts the Weekend of Twinning which encourages Muslims and Jews, Imams and Rabbis, Mosques and synagogues, and Muslim and Jewish organizations to hold joint programming inspired by the commonalities between Muslims and Jews.

The interview was published 4 October on a Web site affiliated with Cairo&#x27;s Al-Azhar University, Islam&#x27;s most respected theological academy. Immediately after 9/11, Imam Al-Gamei&#x27;a had presided over an interfaith service at his mosque. At the service the imam was quoted as saying, &quot;We emphasize the condemnation of all persons, whoever they be, who have carried out this inhuman act.&quot; The Reverend James Parks Morton, president of the Interfaith Center of New York, who attended the service, called Imam Al-Gamei&#x27;a&#x27;s subsequent comments &quot;astonishing.&quot; &quot;It makes interfaith dialogue all the more important,&quot; Reverend Morton said.
Post 9/11 remarks made by Muslim leaders in Cleveland and Los Angeles also led to the suspension of longstanding Muslim–Jewish dialogues. Some Jewish community leaders cite the statements as the latest evidence that Muslim–Jewish dialogue is futile in today&#x27;s charged atmosphere. John Rosove, senior rabbi of Temple Israel of Hollywood, and other Jewish participants withdrew from the three-year-old Muslim-Jewish dialogue group after one of the Muslim participants, Salam al-Marayati of MPAC, suggested in a radio interview that Israel should be put on the list of suspects behind the 11 September attacks. However, in January 2011, MPAC member Wa’el Azmeh and Temple Israel engaged in an interfaith dialogue.

In Cleveland, Jewish community leaders put Muslim–Jewish relations on hold after the spiritual leader of a prominent mosque appeared in (a 1991) videotape ...aired after 9/11 by a local TV station. Imam Fawaz Damra calls for &quot;directing all the rifles at the first and last enemy of the Islamic nation and that is the sons of monkeys and pigs, the Jews.&quot; The revelation was all the more shocking since Imam Damra had been an active participant in local interfaith activities.

Good Jewish–Muslim relations continue in Detroit, which has the nation&#x27;s largest Arab-American community. Jewish organizations there have established good relations with a religious group called the Islamic Supreme Council of North America.

In Los Angeles, there has been a formation of an interfaith think tank through the partnership of neighboring institutions the University of Southern California, The Hebrew Union College, and Omar Foundation. The Center for Muslim–Jewish Engagement has an extensive online resource center with scholarly works on similar topics from Muslim and Jewish perspectives. The Center of Muslim–Jewish Engagement has begun to launch an interfaith religious text-study group to build bonds and form a positive community promoting interfaith relations.

==Common aspects==

There are many common aspects between Islam and Judaism. As Islam developed it gradually became the major religion closest to Judaism, both of them being strictly Monotheist religious traditions originating in a Semitic Middle Eastern culture. As opposed to Christianity, which originated from interaction between ancient Greek and Hebrew cultures, Islam is similar to Judaism in its fundamental religious outlook, structure, jurisprudence and practice. Because of this, many Jewish scholars like Maimonides viewed Islam as non-idolatrous (and therefore permitted to be practiced by non-Jews), albeit other Jewish scholars considered Islam a form of idolatry for various reasons.

There are many traditions within Islam originating from traditions within the Hebrew Bible or from postbiblical Jewish traditions. These practices are known collectively as the Isra&#x27;iliyat.

===Holy scripture===
Islam and Judaism share the idea of a revealed scripture. Even though they differ over the precise text and its interpretations, the Hebrew &quot;Torah&quot; and the Muslim &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; share a lot of narrative as well as injunctions. From this, they share many other fundamental religious concepts such as the belief in a day of Divine Judgment. Reflecting the vintage of the religions, the Torah is traditionally in the form of a scroll and the Qur&#x27;an in the form of a codex.

Muslims commonly refer to Jews (and Christians) as fellow &quot;People of the Book&quot;: people who follow the same general teachings in relation to the worship of the one God worshipped by Abraham. The &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot; distinguishes between &quot;People of the Book&quot; (Jews and Christians), who should be tolerated even if they hold to their faiths, and idolaters (polytheists) who are not given that same degree of tolerance (See Al-Baqara, 256). Some restrictions for Muslims are relaxed, such as Muslim males being allowed to marry a woman from the &quot;People of the Book&quot;, or Muslims being allowed to eat Kosher meat.

The Quranic account and Islamic sources explain that the Torah has undergone extensive corruption through textual alteration and contextomy. Various Jewish factions had sparred in the Hasmonean era of who the most notable were the Pharisees and Sadducees. The modern Jewish tradition originates from the Pharisaic school which has dominated Jewish theology since the end of the Second Temple period. The Pharisees and Sadducees had differed over the interpretation of the Biblocal canon. The Sadducees adopted a stricter literal interpretation of the Bible against the Pharisaic stress on the Oral Torah and a non-literal interpretation of the written Torah with the usage of the oral Torah. Such interpretation advanced far beyond the literal interpretations. Later the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud continued with constructing a framework of interpreting the Torah homiletically. This framework was sketched out early in the Talmud and this framework is attributed to R.Hillel, R.Ishmael b. Elisha and R. Eli&#x27;ezer b.R. Yossey of the Galilee. The Bablylonian Talmud documents seventy incidents where the sages interpreted the Bible by chainging a word or more. This came about by processes such as changing the vocalisation of verbiage, because Hebrew alphabet is consonantal, to suit a particular interpretation. At other times Talmudic sages would split words into two. With this evidence, Mazuz points out that the Quranic charge of the Torah&#x27;s corruption was not misleading but was a rejection of the homiletic methodology in the Talmud.

===Religious law===
===Rules of conduct===
The most obvious common practice is the statement of the absolute unity of God, which Muslims observe in their five times daily prayers (salat), and Jews state at least twice (Shema Yisrael), along with praying 3 times daily. The two faiths also share the central practices of fasting (see Yom Kippur and Ramadan) and almsgiving, as well as dietary laws and other aspects of ritual purity.
Under the strict dietary laws, lawful food is called &quot;Kosher&quot; in Judaism and &quot;Halal&quot; in Islam. Both religions prohibit the consumption of pork. Halal restrictions are similar to a subset of the Kashrut dietary laws, so all kosher foods are considered halal, while not all halal foods are Kosher. Halal laws, for instance, do not prohibit the mixing of milk and meat or the consumption of shellfish, each of which are prohibited by the kosher laws, with the exception that in the Shia Islam belief shellfish, mussels, and similar sea foods and fish without scales are not considered halal. 

Sacred texts of both religions ban homosexuality and forbid human sexual relations outside of marriage and necessitate abstinence during the wife&#x27;s menstruation. Both Islam and Judaism practice circumcision of males.
===Other similarities===
Islam and Judaism both consider the Christian doctrine of the trinity and the belief of Jesus being God as explicitly against the tenets of monotheism. Idolatry and the worship of graven images is likewise forbidden in both religions. Both have official colors (Blue in Judaism and Green in Islam). Both faiths believe in angels, as servants of God and share a similar idea of demons (&quot;Jinn&quot; and &quot;Shedim&quot;); Jewish demonology mentions ha-Satan and Muslim demonology mentions Al-Shai&#x27;tan both rejecting him as an opponent of God. Many angels also possess similar names and roles in both Judaism and Islam. Neither religion subscribes to the concept of original sin and both religions traditionally view homosexuality as sinful. Narrative similarities between Jewish texts and the Hadith have also been noted. For example, both state that Potiphar&#x27;s wife was named Zuleika.

There is a small bone in the body at the base of the spinal column called the Luz bone (known by differing traditions as either the coccyx or the seventh cervical vertebra) from which the body will be rebuilt at the time of resurrection, according to Muslims and Jews who share the belief that this bone does not decay. Muslim books refer to this bone as &quot;^Ajbu al-Thanab&quot; (عَجْبُ الذَّنَب). Rabbi Joshua Ben Hananiah replied to Hadrian, as to how man revived in the world to come, &quot;From Luz, in the back-bone&quot;.

The Islamic Hadith and Jewish Talmud have also often been compared as authoritative extracanonical texts that were originally oral transmissions for generations before being committed to writing.

==Interplay between Jewish and Islamic thought==

===&quot;Saadia Gaon&quot;===
&quot;One of the most important early Jewish philosophers influenced by Islamic philosophy is Rav Saadia Gaon (892–942). His most important work is Emunoth ve-Deoth (Book of Beliefs and Opinions). In this work Saadia treats of the questions that interested the Mutakallimun so deeply—such as the creation of matter, the unity of God, the divine attributes, the soul, etc.—and he criticizes the philosophers severely.&quot;

The 12th century saw the apotheosis of pure philosophy. This supreme exaltation of philosophy was due, in great measure, to Ghazali (1058–1111) among the Arabs, and to Judah ha-Levi (1140) among the Jews. Like Ghazali, Judah ha-Levi took upon himself to free religion from the shackles of speculative philosophy, and to this end wrote the &quot;Kuzari&quot;, in which he sought to discredit all schools of philosophy alike.

===Maimonides===

Maimonides endeavored to harmonize the philosophy of Aristotle with Judaism; and to this end he composed the work, &quot;Dalalat al-Ḥairin&quot; (&quot;Guide for the Perplexed&quot;)—known better under its Hebrew title &quot;Moreh Nevuchim&quot;—which served for many centuries as the subject of discussion and comment by Jewish thinkers. In this work, Maimonides considers creation, the unity of God, the attributes of God, the soul, etc., and treats them in accordance with the theories of Aristotle to the extent in which these latter do not conflict with religion. For example, while accepting the teachings of Aristotle upon matter and form, he pronounces against the eternity of matter. Nor does he accept Aristotle&#x27;s theory that God can have a knowledge of universals only, and not of particulars. If He had no knowledge of particulars, He would be subject to constant change. Maimonides argues: &quot;God perceives future events before they happen, and this perception never fails Him. Therefore there are no new ideas to present themselves to Him. He knows that such and such an individual does not yet exist, but that he will be born at such a time, exist for such a period, and then return into non-existence. When then this individual comes into being, God does not learn any new fact; nothing has happened that He knew not of, for He knew this individual, such as he is now, before his birth&quot; (&quot;Moreh&quot;, i.20). While seeking thus to avoid the troublesome consequences certain Aristotelian theories would entail upon religion, Maimonides could not altogether escape those involved in Aristotle&#x27;s idea of the unity of souls; and herein he laid himself open to the attacks of the orthodox.

A series of eminent men—such as the Tibbons, Narboni, and Gersonides—joined in translating the Arabic philosophical works into Hebrew and commenting upon them. The works of Ibn Roshd especially became the subject of their study, due in great measure to Maimonides, who, in a letter addressed to his pupil Joseph ben Judah, spoke in the highest terms of Ibn Roshd&#x27;s commentary.

In a response, Maimonides discusses the relationship between Judaism and Islam:
The Ishmaelites are not at all idolaters; [idolatry] has long been severed from their mouths and hearts; and they attribute to God a proper unity, a unity concerning which there is no doubt. And because they lie about us, and falsely attribute to us the statement that God has a son, is no reason for us to lie about them and say that they are idolaters ... And should anyone say that the house that they honor [the Kaaba] is a house of idolatry and an idol is hidden within it, which their ancestors used to worship, then what of it? The hearts of those who bow down toward it today are [directed] only toward Heaven ... [Regarding] the Ishmaelites today—idolatry has been severed from the mouths of all of them [including] women and children. Their error and foolishness is in other things which cannot be put into writing because of the renegades and wicked among Israel [i.e., apostates]. But as regards the unity of God they have no error at all.
===Influence on exegesis===
Saadia Gaon&#x27;s commentary on the Bible bears the stamp of the Mutazilites; and its author, while not admitting any positive attributes of God, except these of essence, endeavors to interpret Biblical passages in such a way as to rid them of anthropomorphism. The Jewish commentator, Abraham ibn Ezra, explains the Biblical account of Creation and other Scriptural passages in a philosophical sense. Nahmanides (Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman), too, and other commentators, show the influence of the philosophical ideas current in their respective epochs. This salutary inspiration, which lasted for five consecutive centuries, yielded to that other influence alone that came from the neglected depths of Jewish and of Neoplatonic mysticism, and which took the name of &quot;Kabbalah&quot;.

==Muslim–Jewish wars and military conflicts==

In the early days of Islam, according to Islamic sources, a Jewish tribe of Arabia (see Banu Qurayza) was alleged to have broken the peace treaty with the early Muslims, resulting in the execution of over 700 Jews. The children and women were subsequently taken by Muslim soldiers; one of these, Safiyya bint Huyayy whose husband Kenana ibn al-Rabi had also been killed, was taken by Muhammad as his wife. There were notable persecutions of Jews such as the 1033 Fez massacre, 1066 Granada massacre and 1834 looting of Safed. In the late 19th century, the Zionist movement sought to re-establish a Jewish homeland in historic Israel, within the historical territory of Palestine, also known as Zion, also known as the Holy Land. This created tensions between the Palestinian Jews and Palestinian Arabs, leading to, beginning in 1947, a civil war and the subsequent exodus of many Palestinian Arabs and many Jews from Muslim countries. In 1948, the state of Israel was declared, and shortly after its declaration of independence, the Arab States declared war on Israel, in which the Israelis were victorious. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, twelve more wars were fought between the Arab States and Israel. The Arab–Israeli conflict has weakened Islamic–Jewish relations severely.

<text>Nothing&#x27;s Shocking is the debut studio album by American rock band Jane&#x27;s Addiction, released on August 23, 1988 through Warner Bros. Records. The album was preceded by the band&#x27;s eponymous live debut album.

&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; was well received by critics and peaked at number 103 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eventually being certified platinum by the RIAA. The single &quot;Jane Says&quot; reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks in 1988, although the album was subject to censorship due to its cover and the music video for the second single, &quot;Mountain Song&quot;. It received a nomination for the 31st Grammy Awards in the category for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, ultimately losing to Jethro Tull&#x27;s Crest of a Knave.

Since its release, the album has continued to receive widespread acclaim and is now regarded as one of the most important Alternative Rock albums of all time and one of the greatest albums of the 1980s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; at number 312 on its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, while frequently appearing on &quot;best album&quot; lists of the 1980s. 

==Background==
Jane&#x27;s Addiction was formed in 1985 in Los Angeles by singer Perry Farrell and bassist Eric Avery. After going through multiple drummers and guitarists, they eventually recruited guitarist Dave Navarro and drummer Stephen Perkins.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction became a sensation on the Los Angeles club scene, primarily headlining at Scream, and won interest from a variety of record labels. While the group decided to sign with Warner Bros. Records, they insisted on releasing their debut on independent record label Triple X Records first. The band&#x27;s manager negotiated the largest advance up to that point, with Warner Bros. signing the band for between $250,000 to $300,000. In January 1987, the band recorded its debut &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; during a performance at the Roxy Theatre, at a cost of $4,000. Before the album&#x27;s release, Jane&#x27;s Addiction supported British band Love and Rockets on a two-month tour in late 1987. In late 1987, the band opened for former Bauhaus vocalist Peter Murphy at the now demolished Fender&#x27;s Ballroom in Long Beach, before entering the studio to record their debut studio album, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking,&quot; in January of 1988. 
==Recording==
Warner Bros. Records gave Jane&#x27;s Addiction a list of producers to choose from. The band&#x27;s frontman, Perry Farrell, appreciated Dave Jerden&#x27;s work as engineer on David Byrne and Brian Eno&#x27;s album, &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot;. Jerden said he &quot;jumped&quot; at the chance to work with the group. &quot;I had a demo tape of 18 songs,&quot; Jerden recalled, &quot;and I listened to it every night all summer. I picked nine songs from the tape and put them in an order. And then I said to the band, &#x27;Let&#x27;s do these nine songs. You&#x27;ll rehearse them in this order, and we&#x27;ll record them in this order.&#x27; And that&#x27;s what we did.&quot;

During the recording sessions, Farrell stated he wanted 50% of the band&#x27;s publishing royalties for writing the lyrics, plus a quarter of the remaining half for writing music, adding up to 62.5%. Bassist Eric Avery said he and the other members – guitarist Dave Navarro and drummer Stephen Perkins – were stunned by these demands. One day, Jerden drove to the studio to find Farrell, Navarro, and Perkins leaving; Farrell told him the band had broken up and there would be no record. Warner Bros. called an emergency meeting to resolve the situation. Farrell received the percentage he sought, and the other members received 12.5% each. Avery said the incident had a profound effect on the band, creating an internal fracture.

Not long after the royalties dispute, Farrell and Avery – who had cofounded the band – had a falling out. This was the result of Avery&#x27;s newfound sobriety as well as an incident in which Farrell believed Avery had drunkenly tried to pick up his girlfriend. &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Farrell recalled, &quot;the tensions between Eric and I affected the whole family. Some people were asked to take sides, and others just moped about because they didn&#x27;t know what was going on.&quot; Perkins, however, is reported to have got along with Navarro, Avery, and Farrell.

==Music==
The writing process varied from song to song. &quot;Some came from Eric&#x27;s bass lines,&quot; noted Navarro, &quot;some from guitar, some came from Perry, some came from drum riffs, and some just came from free-form jams. There was really no formula.&quot; Avery wrote several songs, including &quot;Mountain Song&quot;, &quot;Had a Dad&quot;, &quot;Jane Says&quot;, and &quot;Summertime Rolls&quot; (the latter two of which he also created the guitar parts for). For his songs, Avery came up with lyrical concepts that Perry Farrell would create lyrics for; for example, &quot;Had a Dad&quot; dealt with Avery discovering he had a different biological father.

&quot;Jane Says&quot; and &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot;, which first appeared on the band&#x27;s self-titled 1987 debut, were rerecorded for &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;. The later version of &quot;Jane Says&quot; features a steel drum while the spoken interlude in &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot; is completely different.

&quot;Mountain Song&quot; – originally released in 1987 on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Dudes&quot; – was also rerecorded. Musically similar to the original, it is sung in a higher key, to be consistent with the rest of the record. The 1987 original saw a more widespread release when it was included on the band&#x27;s 1997 outtake/alternate/live and new compilation &quot;Kettle Whistle&quot;.

Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea played trumpet on &quot;Idiots Rule&quot;.

==Packaging==
Farrell and his then girlfriend Casey Niccoli created the cover image, which features a sculpture of nude female conjoined twins on a rocking chair with their heads on fire. He initially hired Warner Bros. employees to create the sculpture, but – after learning how to create sculptures by watching them closely – fired them and created the artwork himself. &quot;The idea came from a dream I had,&quot; he recalled. &quot;There were these two women swinging back and forth. They were joined at the hip and shoulder, and their hair was on fire. I just went from there, and Casey assisted me. We had a fellow come and do a plaster body-casting of her, then we made the twins&#x27; hair and head gear from pipe cleaners. You&#x27;ll notice the chair rocks from side to side, as opposed to back and forth, so we had to have that made specially. We also went shopping for fake eyeballs.&quot;

Owing to the cover, nine of the eleven leading record store chains refused to carry &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot;. It was issued covered with brown paper.

==Release==
&quot;&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; was released on August 23, 1988. Three singles were released to support the album, &quot;Jane Says&quot;, &quot;Mountain Song&quot;, and &quot;Ocean Size.&quot; &quot;Mountain Song&quot; and Ocean Size&quot; were both accompanied by music videos, however, MTV refused to air the former&#x27;s music video owing to a scene containing graphic nudity. Farrell decided to release the video commercially, adding twenty minutes of additional footage to create the &quot;Soul Kiss&quot; home video.

Lack of airplay on MTV and modern rock radio meant &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; sold only 200,000 to 250,000 copies in its first year of release. By 1998, it had been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of one million copies in the United States.

After the album&#x27;s release, the band went on tour, opening for Iggy Pop and The Ramones. The tour helped bring attention to the band, who, by the end of the tour, were headlining clubs and theaters.

===2012 remaster===
A remastered edition of &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; was released on June 19, 2012 on a 24 karat gold disc.

Other than the addition of remastering production credits and a cardboard slipcase over the standard jewel case, the liner notes and artwork are almost identical to the original release. Likewise, the track list remained unchanged. The most notable artwork difference between the original and the remaster is in the color of band name typeface on the cover: the original is rendered in a deep teal color with black outline while the remaster features a light grey type with purple outline.

Produced by Audio Fidelity, the remaster had a limited production run of 5,000 units. Each pressing came individually numbered.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Steve Pond praised Jane&#x27;s Addiction as &quot;the true heir to Led Zeppelin&quot; and called the album &quot;simultaneously forbidding and weighty, delicate and ethereal&quot;, while also distinctly more &quot;hardheaded and realistic&quot; in sensibility than Led Zeppelin&#x27;s music. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Richard Cromelin commented that Jane&#x27;s Addiction &quot;sounds supremely assured as it alternates its taut, brutal metal alloy with oddly endearing moments of reflection&quot;, describing their style as &quot;a bracing throwback to rebellious sources and forces of excess like old Black Sabbath and Alice Cooper&quot;. Ken Tucker, writing for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, found the album&#x27;s lyrics incomprehensible in meaning, but viewed them as secondary to the music, which he deemed &quot;first-rate – deceptively slapdash, passionately messy, thoroughly exhilarating.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s Phil Wilding hailed Jane&#x27;s Addiction as &quot;the second coming&quot; and posited that their innovation would be &quot;understood&quot; over time, while &quot;Q&quot;″s Martin Aston wrote that the band manages to recall acts such as Led Zeppelin and Van Halen without resorting to &quot;the plagiarism that plagues the HM/hard rock genre.&quot; Jack Barron of &quot;NME&quot; credited Jane&#x27;s Addiction for having &quot;breadth&quot; and concluded that they &quot;come from a town ruled by glam where talent is only mascara deep, but this is no five-year-old&#x27;s IQ on show here.&quot;

At the end of 1988, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; was voted the 34th best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. The poll&#x27;s curator, Robert Christgau, was lukewarm toward the record, summarizing Jane&#x27;s Addiction as &quot;Alice Cooper revisited&quot; while conceding that &quot;if they stick at it like the pros they&#x27;ll be, they might land an &#x27;Only Women Bleed.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy==

In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato called &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; a &quot;now classic&quot; album and &quot;a must-have for lovers of cutting-edge, influential, and timeless hard rock.&quot; Steve Hochman, writing in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, regarded it as an &quot;often stunning&quot; work whose songs juxtapose &quot;slinky Zeppelin thunder with personal/poetic imagery recalling Lou Reed.&quot; &quot;Even with all the baggage of prophecy and influence,&quot; wrote Ian Cohen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; lives as a poignant, almost quixotic work of Hollywood imagination&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed it as one of the 1980s&#x27; best albums in 2002, ranking it 90th, and in 2018, ranking it 134th. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; named it the 32nd best album of the 1980s. &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; was ranked at number 312 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 edition of its &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list.

&quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; influenced me a lot, especially with what Eric Avery proposed from the bass,&quot; said Nick Oliveri, founder of Kyuss and Mondo Generator and former member of Queens of the Stone Age. &quot;Eric had written the music on his own, the guitars and the drums came later. So he inspired me on that side, it is very possible that they were the first really alternative band.&quot;

<doc id="195975" wikidata="Q295839" url="?curid=195975" title="Chūichi Nagumo">
<text>was an admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War II. Nagumo led Japan&#x27;s main carrier battle group, the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;, in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, and over the next months in successful raids on Darwin in Australia and in the Indian Ocean. In June 1942, he participated at the Battle of Midway, where his strike force suffered a crushing defeat. Nagumo was re-assigned to another fleet during the Guadalcanal campaign, and later stationed in the home islands. In 1944, he was deployed to a naval command in the Mariana Islands, where he committed suicide during the Battle of Saipan.

==Early life==

Nagumo was born in the city of Yonezawa, Yamagata Prefecture, in northern Japan in 1887. He graduated from the 36th class of the IJN Academy in 1908, with a ranking of 8 out of a class of 191 cadets. As a midshipman, he served in the protected cruisers and and the armored cruiser . After his promotion to ensign in 1910 he was assigned to cruiser .

After attending torpedo and naval artillery schools, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant and served in the battleship , followed by the destroyer . In 1914, he was promoted to lieutenant and was assigned to the battlecruiser , followed by the destroyer . He was assigned his first command, the destroyer , on 15 December 1917.

Nagumo graduated from the Naval War College and was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1920. His specialty was torpedo and destroyer tactics. 

From 1920 to 1921, he was captain of the destroyer , but was soon sent to shore duty with various assignments by the IJN General Staff. He became a commander in 1924. From 1925 to 1926, Nagumo accompanied a Japanese mission to study naval warfare strategy, tactics, and equipment in Western Europe and the United States.

After his return to Japan, Nagumo was assigned to duties in Chinese territorial waters. He was appointed captain of the river gunboat from 20 March 1926 to 15 October 1926, followed by the gunboat from 15 October 1926 to 15 November 1927. He then served as an instructor at the IJN Academy from 1927 to 1929. Nagumo was promoted to captain in November 1929 and assumed command of the light cruiser and from 1930 to 1931 was commander of the 11th Destroyer Division. After serving in administrative positions from 1931 to 1933, he assumed command of the heavy cruiser from 1933 to 1934, and the battleship from 1934 to 1935. He was promoted to Rear Admiral on 1 November 1935.

As a Rear Admiral, Nagumo commanded the 8th Cruiser Division to support Imperial Japanese Army movements in China from the Yellow Sea. As a leading officer of the militaristic Fleet Faction, he also received a boost in his career from political forces.

From 1937 to 1938, he was commandant of the Torpedo School, and from 1938 to 1939, he was commander of the 3rd Cruiser Division. Nagumo was promoted to vice admiral on 15 November 1939. From November 1940 to April 1941, Nagumo was commandant of the Naval War College.

==World War II==
On 10 April 1941, Nagumo was appointed commander-in-chief of the First Air Fleet, the IJN&#x27;s main carrier battle group, largely due to his seniority. Many contemporaries and historians have doubted his suitability for this command, given his lack of familiarity with naval aviation. Nagumo&#x27;s friend and fellow admiral Nishizō Tsukahara would say that: &quot;He (Nagumo) was wholly unfitted by background, training, experience, and interest for a major role in Japan’s naval air arm.&quot; Nagumo was appointed by the Navy General Staff, rather than the Combined Fleet. Vice-admiral Jisaburō Ozawa was Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s choice for the command of First Air Fleet but Yamamoto did not have a strong enough case to remove Nagumo.

By this time, he had visibly aged, physically and mentally. Physically, he suffered from arthritis, possibly from his younger days as a &quot;kendoka&quot;. Mentally, he had become a cautious officer who carefully worked over the tactical plans of every operation in which he was involved; his inflexibility in command decisions became more apparent. 

Admiral Tsukahara had doubts about Nagumo&#x27;s appointment, and commented, &quot;Nagumo was an officer of the old school, a specialist of torpedo and surface maneuvers... He did not have any idea of the capability and potential of naval aviation.&quot; One son of Nagumo described him as a brooding father, obsessed with and later regretful about pressuring his sons into joining the IJN. In contrast, Nagumo&#x27;s junior naval officers thought of him as a father figure.

Despite his limited experience, he was a strong advocate of combining sea and air power, although he was opposed to Admiral Yamamoto&#x27;s plan to attack the United States Navy Naval Station Pearl Harbor. While commanding the First Air Fleet, Nagumo oversaw the attack on Pearl Harbor, but he was later criticized for his failure to launch a third attack, which might have destroyed the fuel oil storage and repair facilities. This could have rendered the most important U.S. naval base in the Pacific useless, especially as the continued operation of the submarine base and the use of the intelligence station at the installation were critical factors in Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Pacific War.

Nagumo was surrounded by able lieutenants such as Minoru Genda and Mitsuo Fuchida. He also fought well in the early 1942 campaigns, obtaining success as a fleet commander at the Bombing of Darwin and at the Indian Ocean raid on the Eastern Fleet, the latter of which sank an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and two destroyers, and caused Admiral Sir James Somerville to retreat to East Africa.

===Battle of Midway===
The Battle of Midway, in June 1942, brought Nagumo&#x27;s streak of victories to an end. During the battle, a Martin B-26 Marauder, seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire, flew directly at the bridge of the aircraft carrier . The aircraft, either attempting a suicide ramming, or out of control, narrowly missed striking the carrier&#x27;s bridge, which could have killed Nagumo, before it crashed into the ocean. 

Nagumo soon launched another attack on Midway, in direct violation of Yamamoto&#x27;s order to keep the reserve strike force armed for anti-ship operations. That change in plans required arming the available planes with bombs, suitable for attacking land targets, rather than torpedoes, designed for anti-ship actions.

However, when Nagumo received scouting reports that American ships were in the area, he changed plans and ordered his planes be rearmed with torpedoes to attack American ships. The situation caught his aircraft in-between, with half his planes armed with torpedoes and the other half with bombs and no time to switch everything back to torpedoes.

American dive-bombers attacked &quot;Akagi&quot;, and , resulting in fires and further explosions due to unsecured ordinance, crippling all three. After the attack, Nagumo appeared to have gone into a state of shock; he stood near the ship&#x27;s compass looking out at the flames on his ship and two other carriers, and despite being asked to shift his flag to another vessel, Nagumo was reluctant, muttering, “It&#x27;s not time yet”. Nagumo&#x27;s chief of staff, Rear Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka, was able to persuade him; Nagumo nodded, with tears in his eyes. Nagumo and his staff were forced to evacuate through the forward windows of the bridge by rope. An expert in judo, Nagumo landed lightly, whereas Kusaka badly sprained both ankles and was burned during the evacuation. 

The First Air Fleet lost four carriers during the turning point of the Pacific War, and the massive losses of carrier aircraft maintenance personnel would prove detrimental to the performance of the IJN in later engagements. The loss of the four carriers, their aircraft, and their maintenance crews, plus the loss of 120 experienced pilots, resulted in Japan losing the strategic initiative in the Pacific. 

In the aftermath of the battle, Kusaka found a downcast Nagumo, seemingly contemplating suicide; Kusaka eventually talked him out of it. Following the battle, Nagumo appeared to have lost his aggressiveness and effectiveness; he teared up when talking about the events of Midway to his two sons in 1944.

===Later naval operations, Guadalcanal campaign and the Battle of Saipan===
Afterwards, Nagumo was reassigned as commander-in-chief of the Third Fleet and commanded aircraft carriers in the Guadalcanal campaign in the battles of the Eastern Solomons and the Santa Cruz Islands. His actions were largely indecisive, and with Japanese naval forces steadily losing manpower, fuel, and material for building replacement ships and aircraft, the fleet gradually frittered away most of its strength.

On 11 November 1942, Nagumo was reassigned to Japan, where he was given command of the Sasebo Naval District. He then transferred to the Kure Naval District on 21 June 1943. From October 1943 to February 1944, Nagumo was once again made commander-in-chief of First Fleet, which was by that time largely involved in only training duties to conserve what little remained of Japan&#x27;s air force. 

As Japan&#x27;s military situation deteriorated, Nagumo was deployed on 4 March 1944 for the short-lived command of the 14th Air Fleet and the Central Pacific Area Fleet in the Mariana Islands.

The Battle of Saipan began on 15 June 1944. The IJN, under Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, was overwhelmed within days by the U.S. 5th Fleet in the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea, where Japan lost three fleet carriers and about 600 aircraft, none of which could be replaced. Nagumo and his Army peer Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito were now on their own to keep control of Saipan.

===Death===

On 6 July 1944, Nagumo, unable to defend his position any longer and refusing to be taken captive, killed himself with a pistol shot to his temple. Defeated commanders were expected to perform &quot;seppuku&quot; in accordance with &quot;bushido&quot;, but he may not have had the time for such a complex ritual. His remains were recovered by U.S. Marines in a remote cave where he had been forced to maintain his headquarters due to extensive bombardment. He was posthumously made a full admiral and awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Golden Kite.

Nagumo&#x27;s grave is located at the Ōbai-in sub-temple of Engaku-ji in Kamakura, next to the grave of his son, Susumu Nagumo, who was killed in battle aboard the destroyer on 4 December 1944.

<text>Public Citizen is an American non-profit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group, and think tank based in Washington, D.C. It was founded in 1971 by the American activist and lawyer Ralph Nader.

==Lobbying efforts==
Public Citizen advocates before all three branches of the United States federal government. Its five divisions include Congress Watch; Energy; Global Trade Watch; the Health Research Group; and Public Citizen Litigation Group, a nationally prominent public interest law firm founded by Alan Morrison and known for its Supreme Court and appellate practice.

Among other issues, Public Citizen has been a public voice on drug pricing. For example, they advocated for Gilead Sciences to test GS-441524, a cheaper alternative to remdesivir. 

==History==
In 1968, Nader recruited seven volunteer law students, dubbed &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot; by the Washington press corps, to evaluate the efficacy and operation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The group&#x27;s ensuing report, which criticized the body as &quot;ineffective&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; led to an American Bar Association investigation of the FTC. Based on the results of that second study, Richard Nixon revitalized the agency and sent it on a path of vigorous consumer protection and antitrust enforcement for the rest of the 1970s.

Nader&#x27;s Raiders became involved in such issues as nuclear safety, international trade, regulation of insecticides, meat processing, pension reform, land use, and banking.

Following the publication of the report, Nader founded Public Citizen in 1971 to engage in public interest lobbying and activism on issues of consumer rights. He served on its board of directors until 1980.

<text>&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1843. It is told by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator&#x27;s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy pale blue &quot;vulture-eye&quot;, as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering the body in the bathtub and hiding it under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator&#x27;s actions result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man&#x27;s beating heart.

The story was first published in James Russell Lowell&#x27;s &quot;The Pioneer&quot; in January 1843. &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; is often considered a classic of the Gothic fiction genre and is one of Poe&#x27;s best known short stories.

The specific motivation for murder, aside from the narrator&#x27;s hatred of the old man&#x27;s eye, the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator, and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, &quot;never wronged&quot; the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed.

Critics have speculated that the old man could be a father figure, the narrator&#x27;s landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his &quot;vulture-eye&quot; represents a veiled secret or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.

==Plot summary==
Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], published in 1923
&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; is a first-person narrative told by an unnamed narrator. Despite insisting that they are sane, the narrator suffers from a disease (nervousness) which causes &quot;over-acuteness of the senses&quot;.

The old man, with whom the narrator lives, has a clouded, pale, blue &quot;vulture-like&quot; eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that they plot to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man and has never felt wronged by him. The narrator is insistent that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that they cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man&#x27;s room to shine a sliver of light onto the &quot;evil eye.&quot; However, the old man&#x27;s vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to &quot;do the work,&quot; thus making the narrator go further into distress.

On the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator&#x27;s hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator&#x27;s nightly ritual. The narrator does not draw back and after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the &quot;evil eye,&quot; revealing that it is wide open. The narrator hears the old man&#x27;s heart beating, which only gets louder and louder. This increases the narrator&#x27;s anxiety to the point where they decide to strike. They jump into the room and the old man shrieks once before he is killed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, ensuring the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man&#x27;s scream during the night causes a neighbor to summon the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was their own in a nightmare and that the old man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man&#x27;s room. The narrator&#x27;s chair is placed on the very spot where the body is concealed; the police suspect nothing, and the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.

The narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in their ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator concludes that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily to the narrator, though the officers do not seem to hear it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart and convinced that the officers are aware of not only the heartbeat but also the narrator&#x27;s guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses. The narrator tells them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man&#x27;s body.

== Publication history ==

Poe wrote the short story in Philadelphia, where he resided at various locations from 1838 to 1844.

&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of &quot;The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine&quot;, a short-lived Boston magazine edited by James Russell Lowell and Robert Carter who were listed as the &quot;proprietors&quot; on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.

Poe was likely paid $10 () for the story. Its original publication included an epigraph that quoted Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s poem &quot;A Psalm of Life.&quot; The story was slightly revised when republished on August 23, 1845, edition of the &quot;Broadway Journal&quot;. That edition omitted Longfellow&#x27;s poem because Poe believed it was plagiarized. &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; was reprinted several more times during Poe&#x27;s lifetime.

== Analysis ==
&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; uses an unreliable narrator. The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their monomania and paranoia. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the perfect crime. One interpretation is that Poe wrote the narrator in a way that &quot;allows the reader to identify with the narrator&quot;.

The narrator of &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other. The story starts &quot;in medias res&quot;, opening with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor, or a psychiatrist. In any case, the narrator tells the story in great detail. What follows is a study of terror but, more specifically, the memory of terror as the narrator is retelling events from the past. The first word of the story, &quot;True!&quot;, is an admission of their guilt, as well as an assurance of reliability. This introduction also serves to gain the reader&#x27;s attention. Every word contributes to the purpose of moving the story forward, exemplifying Poe&#x27;s theories about the writing of short stories.

The story is driven not by the narrator&#x27;s insistence upon their &quot;innocence,&quot; but by their insistence on their sanity. This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder. Their denial of insanity is based on their systematic actions and their precision, as they provide a rational explanation for irrational behavior. This rationality, however, is undermined by their lack of motive (&quot;Object there was none. Passion there was none&quot;). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder &quot;haunted me day and night.&quot; It is difficult to fully understand the narrator&#x27;s true emotions about the blue-eyed man because of this contradiction. It is said that &quot;At the same time he disclosed a deep psychological confusion&quot;, referring to the narrator and the comment that &quot;Object there was none. Passion there was none&quot; and that the idea of murder &quot;haunted me day and night.&quot;

The story&#x27;s final scene shows the result of the narrator&#x27;s feelings of guilt. Like many characters in Gothic fiction, they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending their actions, their &quot;over-acuteness of the senses&quot;; which helps them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad. The guilt in the narrator can be seen when the narrator confessed to the police that the body of the old man was under the floorboards. Even though the old man was dead, the body and heart of the dead man still seemed to haunt the narrator and convict them of the act. &quot;Since such processes of reasoning tend to convict the speaker of madness, it does not seem out of keeping that he is driven to confession&quot;, according to scholar Arthur Robinson. Poe&#x27;s contemporaries may well have been reminded of the controversy over the insanity defense in the 1840s. The confession can be due to a concept called &quot;Illusion of transparency&quot;. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Social Psychology&quot;, &quot;Poe&#x27;s character falsely believes that some police officers can sense his guilt and anxiety over a crime he has committed, a fear that ultimately gets the best of him and causes him to give himself up unnecessarily&quot;.

The narrator claims to have a disease that causes hypersensitivity. A similar motif is used for Roderick Usher in &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; (1839) and in &quot;The Colloquy of Monos and Una&quot; (1841). It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very acute senses, or if it is merely imagined. If this condition is believed to be true, what is heard at the end of the story may not be the old man&#x27;s heart, but deathwatch beetles. The narrator first admits to hearing deathwatch beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds. Henry David Thoreau observed in an 1838 article that deathwatch beetles make sounds similar to a heartbeat. The discrepancy with this theory is that the deathwatch beetles make a &quot;uniformly faint&quot; ticking sound that would have kept at a consistent pace but as the narrator drew closer to the old man the sound got more rapid and louder which would not have been a result of the beetles. The beating could even be the sound of the narrator&#x27;s own heart. Alternatively, if the beating is a product of the narrator&#x27;s imagination, it is that uncontrolled imagination that leads to their own destruction.

It is also possible that the narrator has paranoid schizophrenia. Paranoid schizophrenics very often experience auditory hallucinations. These auditory hallucinations are more often voices, but can also be sounds. The hallucinations do not need to derive from a specific source other than one&#x27;s head, which is another indication that the narrator is suffering from such a psychological disorder.

The relationship between the old man and the narrator is ambiguous. Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot. The narrator may be a servant of the old man&#x27;s or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the &quot;vulture-eye&quot; of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is removal of conscience. The eye may also represent secrecy: only when the eye is found open on the final night, penetrating the veil of secrecy, is the murder carried out.

Richard Wilbur suggested that the tale is an allegorical representation of Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;To Science&quot;, which depicts a struggle between imagination and science. In &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, the old man may thus represent the scientific and rational mind, while the narrator may stand for the imaginative.

==Adaptations==

* The earliest acknowledged adaptation of &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; was in a 1928 20-minute American silent film of that title co-directed by Leon Shamroy and Charles Klein, and starring Otto Matieson as &quot;The Insane&quot;, William Herford as &quot;The Old Man&quot; with Charles Darvas and Hans Fuerberg as &quot;Detectives&quot;. It was faithful to the original tale, unlike future television and film adaptations which often expanded the short story to full-length feature films.
* The earliest known &quot;talkie&quot; adaptation was a 1934 version filmed at the Blattner Studios, Elstree, by Clifton-Hurst Productions, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst and starring Norman Dryden. This version was 55 minutes in length.
* A 1941 live-action adaptation starred Joseph Schildkraut and was the directorial debut of Jules Dassin. This version differs greatly from the original tale, depicting the murderer as driven mad after suffering years of abuse by the hateful older man.
* A 1947 Polish film &quot;Zdradzieckie serce&quot; by Jerzy Zarzycki was never released.
* A 1953 animated short film produced by United Productions of America and narrated by James Mason is included among the list of films preserved in the United States National Film Registry.

* The Canadian radio program &quot;Nightfall&quot; presented an adaptation on August 1, 1980.
* A musical adaptation performed by The Alan Parsons Project was released on their 1976 debut album &quot;Tales of Mystery and Imagination&quot;, and was later covered by Slough Feg for their 2010 album, &quot;The Animal Spirits&quot;.

* The song &quot;Ol&#x27; Evil Eye&quot; off of the 1995 album &quot;Riddle Box&quot; by the Insane Clown Posse adapts a version of the story, as well as sampling audio from a reading of the original story.
* The Radio Tales series produced &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; for National Public Radio in 1998. The story was performed by Winifred Phillips along with music composed by her.
*The 1999 episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; entitled &quot;Squeaky Boots&quot; loosely adapts the short story. In the episode, SpongeBob&#x27;s new boots that squeak with each step stand in for the old man&#x27;s beating heart. Mr. Krabs hides the boots under the floorboards of the Krusty Krab.
* The film &quot;Nightmares from the Mind of Poe&quot; (2006) adapts &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; along with &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, &quot;The Premature Burial&quot; and &quot;The Raven&quot;.
* In 2008, filmmaker Robert Eggers adapted the story as a short. This production was notable for using a lifelike, human-sized puppet to portray the old man. Eggers was largely unknown when he made the short, but it garnered attention when he released it online in 2022, after he had achieved some renown as a director of features.
* The 2009 thriller film &quot;Tell-Tale&quot;, produced by Ridley Scott and Tony Scott, credits Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; as the basis for the story of a man being haunted by his donor&#x27;s memories, after a heart transplant.

* In April 2016, a film adaption directed by John Le Tier was released, entitled &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;. It starred Peter Bogdanovich, Rose McGowan, and Patrick Flueger in the lead role. It featured a full narration of Poe&#x27;s story with added elements imagining the narrator as a former tortured soldier with PTSD.
* &quot;Redrum&quot; (2018), an Indian Hindi-language film, adapts the story. 
* In December 2018, Anthony Neilson&#x27;s stage adaptation was presented at London&#x27;s National Theatre.
* In September 2022, DijitMedia released an adaptation entitled &quot;Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s Tell-Tale Heart&quot;. It featured the protagonist as a female house-servant to the old man, as was common in the United States during the 19th century. Elements from &quot;The Black Cat&quot; were included to highlight the similarities between the actions of the protagonists.
* In October 2023, &quot;Tell-Tale Heart&quot; was loosely adapted for the fifth episode of the Netflix series &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;.

<doc id="195980" wikidata="Q828585" url="?curid=195980" title="Interkosmos">
<text>Interkosmos () was a Soviet space program, designed to help the Soviet Union&#x27;s allies with crewed and uncrewed space missions.

The program was formed in April 1967 in Moscow. All members of the program from USSR were given the Hero of the Soviet Union medal or the Order of Lenin. The program included the allied east-European states of the Warsaw Pact, Eastern Bloc, CoMEcon, and other socialist states like Afghanistan, Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam. Non-aligned states such as India and Syria participated, and capitalist states such as the United Kingdom, France and Austria.

Following the Apollo–Soyuz mission, there were talks between NASA and Interkosmos in the 1970s about a &quot;Shuttle–Salyut&quot; program to fly Space Shuttle missions to a Salyut space station, with later talks in the 1980s even considering flights of the future &quot;Buran&quot;-class orbiter to a future US space station.
Whilst the Shuttle–Salyut program never materialized during the existence of the Soviet Interkosmos program, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the Shuttle–Mir program would follow in these footsteps in the mid-1990s and eventually pave the way to the International Space Station.

Beginning in April 1967 with unpiloted research satellite missions, the first crewed Interkosmos mission occurred in February 1978. Joint crewed spaceflights enabled 14 non-Soviet cosmonauts to participate in Soyuz space flights between 1978 and 1988. The program was responsible for sending into space the first citizen of a country other than the US or USSR: Vladimír Remek of Czechoslovakia. Interkosmos also resulted in the first black and Hispanic person in space, Arnaldo Tamayo Méndez of Cuba, and the first Asian person in space, Phạm Tuân of Vietnam. Of the countries involved, only Bulgaria sent two cosmonauts to space, although the second one did not fly under the Interkosmos program, and the French spationaut Jean-Loup Chrétien flew on two flights.

The Soviet Union also made offers of joint human spaceflight on a commercial basis to the United Kingdom and Japan, resulting in the first British and Japanese cosmonauts. In the early 1980s, an offer was made to Finland as well, with test pilot Jyrki Laukkanen mentioned as one of the potential Finnish cosmonauts. The pilots of the Test Flight () refused on the grounds that participation would not benefit the flight or test pilot activity in any way. No further offers were made to Finland.

<doc id="195982" wikidata="Q623761" url="?curid=195982" title="Levi-Civita symbol">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, tensor analysis, and differential geometry, the Levi-Civita symbol or Levi-Civita epsilon represents a collection of numbers defined from the sign of a permutation of the natural numbers , for some positive integer . It is named after the Italian mathematician and physicist Tullio Levi-Civita. Other names include the [[permutation]] symbol, antisymmetric symbol, or alternating symbol, which refer to its antisymmetric property and definition in terms of permutations.

The standard letters to denote the Levi-Civita symbol are the Greek lower case epsilon or , or less commonly the Latin lower case . Index notation allows one to display permutations in a way compatible with tensor analysis: formula_1 where &quot;each&quot; index takes values . There are indexed values of , which can be arranged into an -dimensional array. The key defining property of the symbol is &quot;total antisymmetry&quot; in the indices. When any two indices are interchanged, equal or not, the symbol is negated: formula_2

If any two indices are equal, the symbol is zero. When all indices are unequal, we have: formula_3 where (called the parity of the permutation) is the number of pairwise interchanges of indices necessary to unscramble into the order , and the factor is called the sign, or signature of the permutation. The value must be defined, else the particular values of the symbol for all permutations are indeterminate. Most authors choose , which means the Levi-Civita symbol equals the sign of a permutation when the indices are all unequal. This choice is used throughout this article.

The term &quot;-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol&quot; refers to the fact that the number of indices on the symbol matches the dimensionality of the vector space in question, which may be Euclidean or non-Euclidean, for example, or Minkowski space. The values of the Levi-Civita symbol are independent of any metric tensor and coordinate system. Also, the specific term &quot;symbol&quot; emphasizes that it is not a tensor because of how it transforms between coordinate systems; however it can be interpreted as a tensor density.

The Levi-Civita symbol allows the determinant of a square matrix, and the cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional Euclidean space, to be expressed in Einstein index notation.

==Definition==
The Levi-Civita symbol is most often used in three and four dimensions, and to some extent in two dimensions, so these are given here before defining the general case.

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions, the Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:
formula_4
The values can be arranged into a 2 × 2 antisymmetric matrix:
formula_5

Use of the two-dimensional symbol is common in condensed matter, and in certain specialized high-energy topics like supersymmetry and twistor theory, where it appears in the context of 2-spinors.

===Three dimensions===

In three dimensions, the Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:
formula_6

That is, is if is an even permutation of , if it is an odd permutation, and 0 if any index is repeated. In three dimensions only, the cyclic permutations of are all even permutations, similarly the anticyclic permutations are all odd permutations. This means in 3d it is sufficient to take cyclic or anticyclic permutations of and easily obtain all the even or odd permutations.

Analogous to 2-dimensional matrices, the values of the 3-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol can be arranged into a array:
where is the depth (: ; : ; : ), is the row and is the column.

Some examples:
formula_7

===Four dimensions===
In four dimensions, the Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:
formula_8

These values can be arranged into a array, although in 4 dimensions and higher this is difficult to draw.

Some examples:
formula_9

===Generalization to &quot;n&quot; dimensions===
More generally, in dimensions, the Levi-Civita symbol is defined by:
formula_10

Thus, it is the sign of the permutation in the case of a permutation, and zero otherwise.

Using the capital pi notation for ordinary multiplication of numbers, an explicit expression for the symbol is:
formula_11
where the signum function (denoted ) returns the sign of its argument while discarding the absolute value if nonzero. The formula is valid for all index values, and for any (when or , this is the empty product). However, computing the formula above naively has a time complexity of , whereas the sign can be computed from the parity of the permutation from its disjoint cycles in only cost.

==Properties==
A tensor whose components in an orthonormal basis are given by the Levi-Civita symbol (a tensor of covariant rank ) is sometimes called a permutation tensor.

Under the ordinary transformation rules for tensors the Levi-Civita symbol is unchanged under pure rotations, consistent with that it is (by definition) the same in all coordinate systems related by orthogonal transformations. However, the Levi-Civita symbol is a pseudotensor because under an orthogonal transformation of Jacobian determinant −1, for example, a reflection in an odd number of dimensions, it &quot;should&quot; acquire a minus sign if it were a tensor. As it does not change at all, the Levi-Civita symbol is, by definition, a pseudotensor.

As the Levi-Civita symbol is a pseudotensor, the result of taking a cross product is a pseudovector, not a vector.

Under a general coordinate change, the components of the permutation tensor are multiplied by the Jacobian of the transformation matrix. This implies that in coordinate frames different from the one in which the tensor was defined, its components can differ from those of the Levi-Civita symbol by an overall factor. If the frame is orthonormal, the factor will be ±1 depending on whether the orientation of the frame is the same or not.

In index-free tensor notation, the Levi-Civita symbol is replaced by the concept of the Hodge dual.

Summation symbols can be eliminated by using Einstein notation, where an index repeated between two or more terms indicates summation over that index. For example,
:formula_12.
In the following examples, Einstein notation is used.

===Two dimensions===
In two dimensions, when all each take the values 1 and 2:

===Three dimensions===
====Index and symbol values====
In three dimensions, when all each take values 1, 2, and 3:

====Product====
The Levi-Civita symbol is related to the Kronecker delta. In three dimensions, the relationship is given by the following equations (vertical lines denote the determinant):

:formula_13

A special case of this result occurs when one of the indices is repeated and summed over:

:formula_14

In Einstein notation, the duplication of the index implies the sum on . The previous is then denoted .

If two indices are repeated (and summed over), this further reduces to:

:formula_15

===&quot;n&quot; dimensions===
====Index and symbol values====
In dimensions, when all take values :


where the exclamation mark () denotes the factorial, and is the generalized Kronecker delta. For any , the property
:formula_16

follows from the facts that 
* every permutation is either even or odd, 
* , and 
* the number of permutations of any -element set number is exactly .

The particular case of () with formula_17 is
formula_18

====Product====
In general, for dimensions, one can write the product of two Levi-Civita symbols as:
formula_19Proof: Both sides change signs upon switching two indices, so without loss of generality assume formula_20. If some formula_21 then left side is zero, and right side is also zero since two of its rows are equal. Similarly for formula_22. Finally, if formula_23, then both sides are 1.

===Proofs===
For (), both sides are antisymmetric with respect of and . We therefore only need to consider the case and . By substitution, we see that the equation holds for , that is, for and . (Both sides are then one). Since the equation is antisymmetric in and , any set of values for these can be reduced to the above case (which holds). The equation thus holds for all values of and .

Using (), we have for ()
:formula_24

Here we used the Einstein summation convention with going from 1 to 2. Next, () follows similarly from ().

To establish (), notice that both sides vanish when . Indeed, if , then one can not choose and such that both permutation symbols on the left are nonzero. Then, with fixed, there are only two ways to choose and from the remaining two indices. For any such indices, we have

:formula_25

(no summation), and the result follows.

Then () follows since and for any distinct indices taking values , we have 
:formula_26(no summation, distinct )

==Applications and examples==

===Determinants===
In linear algebra, the determinant of a square matrix can be written

:formula_27

Similarly the determinant of an matrix can be written as

:formula_28

where each should be summed over , or equivalently:

:formula_29

where now each and each should be summed over . More generally, we have the identity

:formula_30

===Vector cross product===
====Cross product (two vectors)====
Let formula_31 a positively oriented orthonormal basis of a vector space. If and are the coordinates of the vectors and in this basis, then their cross product can be written as a determinant:

:formula_32
hence also using the Levi-Civita symbol, and more simply:
:formula_33

In Einstein notation, the summation symbols may be omitted, and the th component of their cross product equals

:formula_34

The first component is

:formula_35

then by cyclic permutations of the others can be derived immediately, without explicitly calculating them from the above formulae:

:formula_36

====Triple scalar product (three vectors)====
From the above expression for the cross product, we have:
:formula_37.

If is a third vector, then the triple scalar product equals

:formula_38

From this expression, it can be seen that the triple scalar product is antisymmetric when exchanging any pair of arguments. For example,

:formula_39.

====Curl (one vector field)====
If is a vector field defined on some open set of as a function of position (using Cartesian coordinates). Then the th component of the curl of equals

:formula_40

which follows from the cross product expression above, substituting components of the gradient vector operator (nabla).

==Tensor density==
In any arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system and even in the absence of a metric on the manifold, the Levi-Civita symbol as defined above may be considered to be a tensor density field in two different ways. It may be regarded as a contravariant tensor density of weight +1 or as a covariant tensor density of weight −1. In &quot;n&quot; dimensions using the generalized Kronecker delta,

:formula_41

Notice that these are numerically identical. In particular, the sign is the same.

==Levi-Civita tensors==
On a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one may define a coordinate-invariant covariant tensor field whose coordinate representation agrees with the Levi-Civita symbol wherever the coordinate system is such that the basis of the tangent space is orthonormal with respect to the metric and matches a selected orientation. This tensor should not be confused with the tensor density field mentioned above. The presentation in this section closely follows .

The covariant Levi-Civita tensor (also known as the Riemannian volume form) in any coordinate system that matches the selected orientation is
:formula_42

where is the representation of the metric in that coordinate system. We can similarly consider a contravariant Levi-Civita tensor by raising the indices with the metric as usual,
:formula_43

but notice that if the metric signature contains an odd number of negative eigenvalues , then the sign of the components of this tensor differ from the standard Levi-Civita symbol:
:formula_44

where , formula_45 is the usual Levi-Civita symbol discussed in the rest of this article, and we used the definition of the metric determinant in the derivation. More explicitly, when the tensor and basis orientation are chosen such that formula_46, we have that formula_47.

From this we can infer the identity,
:formula_48
where
:formula_49
is the generalized Kronecker delta.

===Example: Minkowski space===
In Minkowski space (the four-dimensional spacetime of special relativity), the covariant Levi-Civita tensor is
:formula_50

where the sign depends on the orientation of the basis. The contravariant Levi-Civita tensor is
:formula_51

The following are examples of the general identity above specialized to Minkowski space (with the negative sign arising from the odd number of negatives in the signature of the metric tensor in either sign convention):
:formula_52

<text>In mathematics, the Hermite polynomials are a classical orthogonal polynomial sequence.

The polynomials arise in:
* signal processing as Hermitian wavelets for wavelet transform analysis
* probability, such as the Edgeworth series, as well as in connection with Brownian motion;
* combinatorics, as an example of an Appell sequence, obeying the umbral calculus;
* numerical analysis as Gaussian quadrature; 
* physics, where they give rise to the eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator; and they also occur in some cases of the heat equation (when the term formula_1 is present);
* systems theory in connection with nonlinear operations on Gaussian noise. 
* random matrix theory in Gaussian ensembles.

Hermite polynomials were defined by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1810, though in scarcely recognizable form, and studied in detail by Pafnuty Chebyshev in 1859. Chebyshev&#x27;s work was overlooked, and they were named later after Charles Hermite, who wrote on the polynomials in 1864, describing them as new. They were consequently not new, although Hermite was the first to define the multidimensional polynomials.

==Definition==
Like the other classical orthogonal polynomials, the Hermite polynomials can be defined from several different starting points. Noting from the outset that there are two different standardizations in common use, one convenient method is as follows:

* The &quot;probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials&quot; are given by formula_2
* while the &quot;physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials&quot; are given by formula_3

These equations have the form of a Rodrigues&#x27; formula and can also be written as,
formula_4

The two definitions are not exactly identical; each is a rescaling of the other:
formula_5

These are Hermite polynomial sequences of different variances; see the material on variances below.

The notation and is that used in the standard references.
The polynomials are sometimes denoted by , especially in probability theory, because
formula_6
is the probability density function for the normal distribution with expected value 0 and standard deviation 1.

* The first eleven probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials are: formula_7
* The first eleven physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials are: formula_8
==Properties==
The th-order Hermite polynomial is a polynomial of degree . The probabilist&#x27;s version has leading coefficient 1, while the physicist&#x27;s version has leading coefficient .

===Symmetry===
From the Rodrigues formulae given above, we can see that and are even or odd functions depending on :
formula_9

===Orthogonality===
 and are th-degree polynomials for . These polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the &quot;weight function&quot; (measure)
formula_10 or formula_11
i.e., we have
formula_12

Furthermore,
formula_13
and
formula_14
where formula_15 
is the Kronecker delta.

The probabilist polynomials are thus orthogonal with respect to the standard normal probability density function.

=== Completeness ===
The Hermite polynomials (probabilist&#x27;s or physicist&#x27;s) form an orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space of functions satisfying
formula_16
in which the inner product is given by the integral
formula_17
including the Gaussian weight function defined in the preceding section.

An orthogonal basis for is a &quot;complete&quot; orthogonal system. For an orthogonal system, &quot;completeness&quot; is equivalent to the fact that the 0 function is the only function orthogonal to &quot;all&quot; functions in the system.

Since the linear span of Hermite polynomials is the space of all polynomials, one has to show (in physicist case) that if satisfies
formula_18
for every , then .

One possible way to do this is to appreciate that the entire function
formula_19
vanishes identically. The fact then that for every real means that the Fourier transform of is 0, hence is 0 almost everywhere. Variants of the above completeness proof apply to other weights with exponential decay.

In the Hermite case, it is also possible to prove an explicit identity that implies completeness (see section on the Completeness relation below).

An equivalent formulation of the fact that Hermite polynomials are an orthogonal basis for consists in introducing Hermite &quot;functions&quot; (see below), and in saying that the Hermite functions are an orthonormal basis for .

===Hermite&#x27;s differential equation===
The probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials are solutions of the differential equation
formula_20
where is a constant. Imposing the boundary condition that should be polynomially bounded at infinity, the equation has solutions only if is a non-negative integer, and the solution is uniquely given by formula_21, where formula_22 denotes a constant.

Rewriting the differential equation as an eigenvalue problem
formula_23
the Hermite polynomials formula_24 may be understood as eigenfunctions of the differential operator formula_25 . This eigenvalue problem is called the Hermite equation, although the term is also used for the closely related equation
formula_26 
whose solution is uniquely given in terms of physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials in the form formula_27, where formula_22 denotes a constant, after imposing the boundary condition that should be polynomially bounded at infinity.

The general solutions to the above second-order differential equations are in fact linear combinations of both Hermite polynomials and confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind. For example, for the physicist&#x27;s Hermite equation
formula_29
the general solution takes the form
formula_30
where formula_22 and formula_32 are constants, formula_33 are physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials (of the first kind), and formula_34 are physicist&#x27;s Hermite functions (of the second kind). The latter functions are compactly represented as formula_35 where formula_36 are Confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind. The conventional Hermite polynomials may also be expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions, see below.

With more general boundary conditions, the Hermite polynomials can be generalized to obtain more general analytic functions for complex-valued . An explicit formula of Hermite polynomials in terms of contour integrals is also possible.

===Recurrence relation===
The sequence of probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials also satisfies the recurrence relation
formula_37
Individual coefficients are related by the following recursion formula:
formula_38 
and , , .

For the physicist&#x27;s polynomials, assuming 
formula_39
we have
formula_40
Individual coefficients are related by the following recursion formula:
formula_41
and , , .

The Hermite polynomials constitute an Appell sequence, i.e., they are a polynomial sequence satisfying the identity
formula_42

An integral recurrence that is deduced and demonstrated in is as follows:
formula_43

formula_44

Equivalently, by Taylor-expanding,
formula_45
These umbral identities are self-evident and included in the differential operator representation detailed below, 
formula_46

In consequence, for the th derivatives the following relations hold:
formula_47

It follows that the Hermite polynomials also satisfy the recurrence relation
formula_48

These last relations, together with the initial polynomials and , can be used in practice to compute the polynomials quickly.

Turán&#x27;s inequalities are
formula_49

Moreover, the following multiplication theorem holds:
formula_50

===Explicit expression===
The physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials can be written explicitly as
formula_51

These two equations may be combined into one using the floor function:
formula_52

The probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials have similar formulas, which may be obtained from these by replacing the power of with the corresponding power of and multiplying the entire sum by :
formula_53

===Inverse explicit expression===
The inverse of the above explicit expressions, that is, those for monomials in terms of probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials are
formula_54

The corresponding expressions for the physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials follow directly by properly scaling this:
formula_55

===Generating function===
The Hermite polynomials are given by the exponential generating function
formula_56

This equality is valid for all complex values of and , and can be obtained by writing the Taylor expansion at of the entire function (in the physicist&#x27;s case). One can also derive the (physicist&#x27;s) generating function by using Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula to write the Hermite polynomials as
formula_57

Using this in the sum 
formula_58 
one can evaluate the remaining integral using the calculus of residues and arrive at the desired generating function.

===Expected values===
If is a random variable with a normal distribution with standard deviation 1 and expected value , then
formula_59

The moments of the standard normal (with expected value zero) may be read off directly from the relation for even indices:
formula_60
where is the double factorial. Note that the above expression is a special case of the representation of the probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials as moments:
formula_61

===Asymptotic expansion===
Asymptotically, as , the expansion
formula_62 
holds true. For certain cases concerning a wider range of evaluation, it is necessary to include a factor for changing amplitude:
formula_63
which, using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, can be further simplified, in the limit, to
formula_64

This expansion is needed to resolve the wavefunction of a quantum harmonic oscillator such that it agrees with the classical approximation in the limit of the correspondence principle.

A better approximation, which accounts for the variation in frequency, is given by
formula_65

A finer approximation, which takes into account the uneven spacing of the zeros near the edges, makes use of the substitution 
formula_66 
with which one has the uniform approximation
formula_67

Similar approximations hold for the monotonic and transition regions. Specifically, if 
formula_68 
then
formula_69
while for formula_70 with complex and bounded, the approximation is
formula_71
where is the Airy function of the first kind.

===Special values===
The physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials evaluated at zero argument are called Hermite numbers.

formula_72
which satisfy the recursion relation .

In terms of the probabilist&#x27;s polynomials this translates to
formula_73

==Relations to other functions==

===Laguerre polynomials===
The Hermite polynomials can be expressed as a special case of the Laguerre polynomials:
formula_74

===Relation to confluent hypergeometric functions===
The physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials can be expressed as a special case of the parabolic cylinder functions:
formula_75
in the right half-plane, where is Tricomi&#x27;s confluent hypergeometric function. Similarly,
formula_76
where is Kummer&#x27;s confluent hypergeometric function.

== Hermite polynomial expansion ==
Similar to Taylor expansion, some functions are expressible as an infinite sum of Hermite polynomials. Specifically, if formula_77, then it has an expansion in the physicist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials.

Given such formula_78, the partial sums of the Hermite expansion of formula_78 converges to in the formula_80 norm if and only if formula_81formula_82formula_83formula_84formula_85formula_86

==Differential-operator representation==
The probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials satisfy the identity formula_87 where represents differentiation with respect to , and the exponential is interpreted by expanding it as a power series. There are no delicate questions of convergence of this series when it operates on polynomials, since all but finitely many terms vanish.

Since the power-series coefficients of the exponential are well known, and higher-order derivatives of the monomial can be written down explicitly, this differential-operator representation gives rise to a concrete formula for the coefficients of that can be used to quickly compute these polynomials.

Since the formal expression for the Weierstrass transform is , we see that the Weierstrass transform of is . Essentially the Weierstrass transform thus turns a series of Hermite polynomials into a corresponding Maclaurin series.

The existence of some formal power series with nonzero constant coefficient, such that , is another equivalent to the statement that these polynomials form an Appell sequence. Since they are an Appell sequence, they are &quot;a fortiori&quot; a Sheffer sequence.

==Contour-integral representation==
From the generating-function representation above, we see that the Hermite polynomials have a representation in terms of a contour integral, as
formula_88
with the contour encircling the origin.

==Generalizations==
The probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomials defined above are orthogonal with respect to the standard normal probability distribution, whose density function is
formula_89
which has expected value 0 and variance 1.

Scaling, one may analogously speak of generalized Hermite polynomials
formula_90
of variance , where is any positive number. These are then orthogonal with respect to the normal probability distribution whose density function is
formula_91
They are given by
formula_92

Now, if 
formula_93
then the polynomial sequence whose th term is
formula_94
is called the umbral composition of the two polynomial sequences. It can be shown to satisfy the identities
formula_95
and
formula_96
The last identity is expressed by saying that this parameterized family of polynomial sequences is known as a cross-sequence. (See the above section on Appell sequences and on the differential-operator representation, which leads to a ready derivation of it. This binomial type identity, for , has already been encountered in the above section on #Recursion relations.)

===&quot;Negative variance&quot;===
Since polynomial sequences form a group under the operation of umbral composition, one may denote by
formula_97
the sequence that is inverse to the one similarly denoted, but without the minus sign, and thus speak of Hermite polynomials of negative variance. For , the coefficients of formula_98 are just the absolute values of the corresponding coefficients of formula_99.

These arise as moments of normal probability distributions: The th moment of the normal distribution with expected value and variance is
formula_100
where is a random variable with the specified normal distribution. A special case of the cross-sequence identity then says that
formula_101

==Hermite functions==

===Definition===
One can define the Hermite functions (often called Hermite-Gaussian functions) from the physicist&#x27;s polynomials:
formula_102
Thus, 
formula_103

Since these functions contain the square root of the weight function and have been scaled appropriately, they are orthonormal:
formula_104
and they form an orthonormal basis of . This fact is equivalent to the corresponding statement for Hermite polynomials (see above).

The Hermite functions are closely related to the Whittaker function :
formula_105
and thereby to other parabolic cylinder functions.

The Hermite functions satisfy the differential equation
formula_106
This equation is equivalent to the Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics, so these functions are the eigenfunctions.
formula_107
=== Recursion relation ===
Following recursion relations of Hermite polynomials, the Hermite functions obey
formula_108
and
formula_109

Extending the first relation to the arbitrary th derivatives for any positive integer leads to
formula_110

This formula can be used in connection with the recurrence relations for and to calculate any derivative of the Hermite functions efficiently.
===Cramér&#x27;s inequality===
For real , the Hermite functions satisfy the following bound due to Harald Cramér and Jack Indritz:
formula_111

===Hermite functions as eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform===
The Hermite functions are a set of eigenfunctions of the continuous Fourier transform . To see this, take the physicist&#x27;s version of the generating function and multiply by . This gives
formula_112

The Fourier transform of the left side is given by
formula_113

The Fourier transform of the right side is given by
formula_114

Equating like powers of in the transformed versions of the left and right sides finally yields
formula_115

The Hermite functions are thus an orthonormal basis of , which &quot;diagonalizes the Fourier transform operator&quot;.

===Wigner distributions of Hermite functions===
The Wigner distribution function of the th-order Hermite function is related to the th-order Laguerre polynomial. The Laguerre polynomials are 
formula_116
leading to the oscillator Laguerre functions
formula_117
For all natural integers , it is straightforward to see that
formula_118
where the Wigner distribution of a function is defined as
formula_119
This is a fundamental result for the quantum harmonic oscillator discovered by Hip Groenewold in 1946 in his PhD thesis. It is the standard paradigm of quantum mechanics in phase space.

There are further relations between the two families of polynomials.

===Partial Overlap Integrals===
It can be shown that the overlap between two different Hermite functions (formula_120) over a given interval has the exact result:
formula_121

===Combinatorial interpretation of coefficients===
In the Hermite polynomial of variance 1, the absolute value of the coefficient of is the number of (unordered) partitions of an -element set into singletons and (unordered) pairs. Equivalently, it is the number of involutions of an -element set with precisely fixed points, or in other words, the number of matchings in the complete graph on vertices that leave vertices uncovered (indeed, the Hermite polynomials are the matching polynomials of these graphs). The sum of the absolute values of the coefficients gives the total number of partitions into singletons and pairs, the so-called telephone numbers
: 1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496... .

This combinatorial interpretation can be related to complete exponential Bell polynomials as
formula_122
where for all .

These numbers may also be expressed as a special value of the Hermite polynomials:
formula_123

=== Completeness relation ===
The Christoffel–Darboux formula for Hermite polynomials reads
formula_124

Moreover, the following completeness identity for the above Hermite functions holds in the sense of distributions:
formula_125
where is the Dirac delta function, the Hermite functions, and represents the Lebesgue measure on the line in , normalized so that its projection on the horizontal axis is the usual Lebesgue measure.

This distributional identity follows by taking in Mehler&#x27;s formula, valid when :
formula_126
which is often stated equivalently as a separable kernel,
formula_127

The function is the bivariate Gaussian probability density on , which is, when is close to 1, very concentrated around the line , and very spread out on that line. It follows that
formula_128
when and are continuous and compactly supported.

This yields that can be expressed in Hermite functions as the sum of a series of vectors in , namely,
formula_129

In order to prove the above equality for , the Fourier transform of Gaussian functions is used repeatedly:
formula_130

The Hermite polynomial is then represented as
formula_131

With this representation for and , it is evident that
formula_132
and this yields the desired resolution of the identity result, using again the Fourier transform of Gaussian kernels under the substitution
formula_133

<text>Grand Centre, now known as Cold Lake South, is a former town in Alberta, Canada, that originally incorporated in 1957. Nearly 40 years later, it merged with nearby Cold Lake to the north and Medley to the west, a community on CFB Cold Lake, to form a new municipality named Cold Lake in 1996. It has an elevation of .

== History ==
The community incorporated as the Village of Grand Centre on January 1, 1957. Sixteen months later, it incorporated as the Town of Grand Centre on April 1, 1958. Grand Centre then amalgamated with the nearby former Town of Cold Lake to the north to form a new town named Cold Lake on October 1, 1996. The amalgamation also included the absorption of the adjacent community of Medley to the west on CFB Cold Lake by way of a concurrent annexation. The amalgamated Cold Lake subsequently incorporated as a city on October 1, 2000. Within the City of Cold Lake, Grand Centre is now referred to as Cold Lake South while the former Town of Cold Lake is referred to Cold Lake North.

== Demographics ==
Just prior to amalgamation, the Town of Grand Centre recorded a population of 4,176 in the 1996 census. Over the next 20 years, Cold Lake South grew to a population of 6,148 according to the 2016 census.

<text>David Lee Ingersoll is a cartoonist and illustrator based in Seattle, United States. Born in Anchorage, Alaska soon after the 1964 earthquake, he spent most of his childhood and young adult years in northern California, specifically the then small town of Sebastopol. He started drawing at an early age, preferring to concentrate on dinosaurs and other monsters.

He has primarily been active in small press publications, contributing illustrations to &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; and a variety of horror and sci-fi zines in the late eighties and early nineties, creating the comic series &quot;Misspent Youths&quot; in 1991, and contributing comics to &quot;GLYPH Magazine&quot; in the late nineties. He is currently contributing to &quot;The Black Seal&quot;, &quot;Worlds of Cthulhu&quot;, various RPG publications and illustrating the comic &quot;Oz Squad&quot;. He is an illustrator for the publisher Chaosium including a cover for the novel &quot;The Spiraling Worm&quot;.

He is married to writer Sarah Byam. Poet Glenn Ingersoll is one of his brothers.

<text>In mathematics, a polynomial sequence is a sequence of polynomials indexed by the nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., in which each index is equal to the degree of the corresponding polynomial. Polynomial sequences are a topic of interest in enumerative combinatorics and algebraic combinatorics, as well as applied mathematics.

==Examples==

Some polynomial sequences arise in physics and approximation theory as the solutions of certain ordinary differential equations:
* Laguerre polynomials
* Chebyshev polynomials
* Legendre polynomials
* Jacobi polynomials

Others come from statistics:
* Hermite polynomials

Many are studied in algebra and combinatorics:
* Monomials
* Rising factorials
* Falling factorials
* All-one polynomials
* Abel polynomials
* Bell polynomials
* Bernoulli polynomials
* Cyclotomic polynomials
* Dickson polynomials
* Fibonacci polynomials
* Lagrange polynomials
* Lucas polynomials
* Spread polynomials
* Touchard polynomials
* Rook polynomials

==Classes of polynomial sequences==
* Polynomial sequences of binomial type
* Orthogonal polynomials
* Secondary polynomials
* Sheffer sequence
* Sturm sequence
* Generalized Appell polynomials

==See also==
*Umbral calculus

<text>Dondi was a daily comic strip about a large-eyed war orphan of the same name. Created by Gus Edson and Irwin Hasen, it ran in more than 100 newspapers for three decades (September 25, 1955, to June 8, 1986).

==Creation and publication history==
Interviewed before a Comic-Con audience in San Diego, illustrator Hasen told TV-comics scripter Mark Evanier the origin of the strip during a trip to Korea:
After the death of Edson in 1966, Bob Oksner teamed with Hasen, whose first strip was dated April 23, 1967. Oksner and Hasen remained with the strip until its 1986 conclusion. When the strip ended, it was carried in only 35 newspapers.

==Characters and story==
Dondi&#x27;s original backstory describes him as a five-year-old World War II orphan of Italian descent. The boy had no memory of his parents or his name, so when a pretty Red Cross worker said he was &quot;a dandy boy,&quot; he thought she was naming him &quot;Dondi.&quot; Two soldiers who spoke no Italian, Ted Wills and Whitey McGowan, found the child wandering through a war-torn village. The soldiers brought the child back to the United States and Ted eventually became his adoptive father.

Like other comic strip boys, such as Dennis in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, Dondi&#x27;s character never ages. This became problematic in later years, as Dondi&#x27;s age made the origin story impossible. Eventually, references to his Italian origin ceased, and he was adopted by Ted and his wife, the former Katje Bogar. &quot;Pop&quot; Fligh, a former pro baseball player, became Dondi&#x27;s adoptive grandfather when he married Ted Wills&#x27; widowed mother. Following this, Dondi was portrayed simply as an adopted child, although in the early 1960s there was a reference to his being an orphan of the Korean War. During the mid-1970s, there was a reference to his being from Vietnam.

A recurring character was Mrs. McGowan, who was the mother of Whitey McGowan. In a rather startling development for a comic strip at the time, Whitey and his new bride died in a car crash on their honeymoon, leaving Dondi to Mrs. McGowan, who had initially resented the boy but came to love him and accept him as her grandson. This explanation was permitted to fade into the mist as the strip grew farther away from World War II.

Dondi was considered by some to be repellently wholesome; a &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; special issue in 1965 included a calendar that celebrated April 9 as &quot;&#x27;Kick &#x27;Dondi&#x27; in the teeth day.&quot; &quot;The Garden City Telegram&quot; (Garden City, Kansas) put it on its calendar, perhaps naïvely or as a joke (it was the April 1 issue).

==Films==
&quot;Dondi&quot; was adapted into a family-oriented film with David Kory in the title role and David Janssen as his American G.I. buddy, Dealey. Singer Patti Page also starred as Liz, and cameo appearances were made by Edson, as a police captain, and Hasen, as a police sketch artist. 

The movie (and especially Kory&#x27;s performance) were negatively received by critics. Kory, the son of Rockette Diane Kory, had one minor TV role in 1963 and never made another film. Produced and directed by Albert Zugsmith, the film was released 26 March 1961. &quot;Dondi&quot; was listed in the 1978 book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;. 

Zugsmith says Allied Artists made the film to show they could make movies for children. He says the studio &quot;arbitrarily cut the wrong twenty minutes out of it.&quot;

A comic book adaptation of the movie was published as &quot;Four Color&quot; #1176 by Dell.

The comic strip is featured in a scene in Kenneth Anger&#x27;s short film &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; (1964), as well as &quot;Sweet Punkin, I Love You (1976).

==Awards==
Hasen received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Award for Story Comic Strip for 1961 and 1962 for his work on the strip.

<doc id="195992" wikidata="Q1052355" url="?curid=195992" title="The Feeding of the 5000 (album)">
<text>The Feeding of the 5000 is the first album by the anarcho-punk band Crass. The album was recorded on 29 October 1978 by John Loder at Southern Studios and was released the same year. It was considered revolutionary in its time due for its extreme sound, frequently profane lyrical content and the anarchist political ideals in the lyrics. The album also saw the introduction of Crass&#x27;s policy of ensuring cheap prices for their records. The album is considered as one of the first punk albums to expound serious anarchist philosophy.

==Album information==
Pete Stennett, owner of Small Wonder Records, heard a demo that the band had recorded. Impressed by all of the material, he decided to package the entire set as an 18-track 12&quot; EP. However, workers at the Irish pressing plant contracted to manufacture the record refused to process it because of the offensively blasphemous content of the track &quot;Asylum&quot;. The record was eventually released with the track removed and replaced by two minutes of silence, retitled &quot;The Sound of Free Speech&quot;. This incident also prompted Crass to establish their own record label in order to retain full editorial control over their material, and &quot;Asylum&quot; was issued shortly afterward in a rerecorded and extended form as a 7&quot; single under the title &quot;Reality Asylum&quot;. A later repress of &quot;The Feeding of The 5000&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Second Sitting&quot;), released by Crass Records in 1980, restored the missing track.

Crass helped reinitiate the influence of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the wider peace campaign in the UK with the songs like &quot;They&#x27;ve Got a Bomb&quot;, &quot;Fight War Not Wars&quot; and the adoption of the CND symbol at their live concerts.

&quot;They&#x27;ve Got a Bomb&quot; contains an extended period of silence, inspired by John Cage&#x27;s &quot;4&#x27;33&quot;&quot;. The band have acknowledged the influence of Cage and said that the idea of the space in the song, when performed live, was to suddenly stop the energy, dancing and noise and allow the audience to momentarily &quot;confront themselves&quot; and consider the reality of nuclear war. However, fans were known to clap and cheer during the silent segment of the track, which is documented on the bonus live album included with the original release of &quot;Stations of the Crass&quot;.

The feeding of the multitude was a miraculous event described in the New Testament in which Jesus fed 5,000 people from just five loaves of bread and two fish. According to Crass drummer and founder Penny Rimbaud, &quot;We named the album &quot;The Feeding of The Five Thousand&quot; because 5,000 was the minimum number that we could get pressed and some 4900 more than we thought we&#x27;d sell. Feeding is now only a few hundred short of going golden, though I don&#x27;t suppose we&#x27;ll hear too much about that in the music press&quot;.

On 16 August 2010, &quot;The Feeding of the 5000&quot; was rereleased as the first volume of &quot;The Crassical Collection&quot;, digitally remastered from the original analogue studio tapes. The release also contains additional artwork by Gee Vaucher, bonus material and a 64-page booklet of lyrics and liner notes by Rimbaud and Steve Ignorant.

In December 2019, the band, in cooperation with One Little Indian Records, released the entire unedited 16-track master tape of the album for fans to remix, with selected results to be included on a compilation album with the working title &quot;Normal Never Was&quot;. It was announced that the proceeds from the album would be given to the anti-domestic abuse charity Refuge.

On 2 October 2020, the &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; version was reissued, with the bonus tracks moved to a second CD.

<doc id="195994" wikidata="Q3140992" url="?curid=195994" title="John Fiske (philosopher)">
<text>John Fiske (March 30, 1842 – July 4, 1901) was an American philosopher and historian. He was heavily influenced by Herbert Spencer and applied Spencer&#x27;s concepts of evolution to his own writings on linguistics, philosophy, religion, and history.

==Biography==
John Fiske was born Edmund Fiske Green at Hartford, Connecticut, March 30, 1842. He was the only child of Edmund Brewster Green, of Smyrna, Delaware, and Mary Fiske Bound, of Middletown, Connecticut. His father was editor of newspapers in Hartford, New York City, and Panama, where he died in 1852, and his widow married Edwin W. Stoughton, of New York, in 1855. On the second marriage of his mother, Edmund Fiske Green assumed the name of his maternal great-grandfather, John Fiske.

As a child, Fiske exhibited remarkable precocity. He lived at Middletown with his grandmother during childhood, and prior to his entering college he had read widely in English literature and history, had excelled in Greek and Latin work, and had studied several modern languages. He then entered Harvard, and graduated from Harvard College in 1863 and from Harvard Law School in 1865. He was admitted to the bar in 1864, but only briefly practiced law. His career as author began in 1861, with an article on &quot;Mr. Buckle&#x27;s Fallacies&quot; published in the &quot;National Quarterly Review&quot;. Following his failure to earn enough money through law, he frequently contributed freelance articles to American and British periodicals.

From 1869 to 1871, he was university lecturer on philosophy at Harvard, in 1870 instructor in history there, and assistant librarian 1872–1879. On resigning the latter position in 1879, he was elected a member of the board of overseers, and at the expiration of the six-year term was re-elected in 1885. Beginning in 1881, he lectured annually on American history at Washington University in St. Louis and beginning in 1884 held a professorship of American history at that institution, but continued to make his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He lectured on American history at University College London in 1879, and at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1880. He gave many hundreds of lectures, chiefly upon American history, in the principal cities of the United States and Great Britain. Fiske was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1884.

The largest part of his life was devoted to the study of history, but at an early age inquiries into the nature of human progress led him to a careful study of the doctrine of evolution, and it was through the popularization of Herbert Spencer&#x27;s work that he first became known to the public. He applied himself to the philosophical interpretation of Darwin&#x27;s work and produced many books and essays on this subject. His philosophy was influenced by Herbert Spencer&#x27;s views on evolution. In a letter from Charles Darwin to John Fiske, dated from 1874, the naturalist remarks: &quot;I never in my life read so lucid an expositor (and therefore thinker) as you are.&quot;
Nineteenth-century enthusiasm for brain size as a simple measure of human performance, championed by scientists including Darwin&#x27;s cousin Francis Galton and the French neurologist Paul Broca, led Fiske to believe in the racial superiority of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon race&quot;. Fiske&#x27;s beliefs on race did not preclude his commitment to abolitionist causes. Indeed, so anti-slavery was he that twenty-three years after the cessation of the American Civil War, he declared the North&#x27;s victory complete &quot;despite the feeble wails&quot; of &quot;unteachable bigots.&quot; In his book &quot;The Destiny of Man&quot; (1884), he devotes a whole chapter to the &quot;End of the working of natural selection upon man&quot;, describing it as &quot;a fact of unparalleled grandeur.&quot; In his view, &quot;the action of natural selection upon Man has [...] been essentially diminished through the operation of social conditions.&quot;

In books such as &quot;Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy&quot; (), Fiske aimed to show that &quot;in reality there has never been any conflict between religion and science, nor is any reconciliation called for where harmony has always existed.&quot; On page 364, he demonstrates his sensitivity to Christianity as a religion:

We arrive at a deeper reason than has hitherto been disclosed for the difference between our position with reference to Christianity, and that which has been assumed by Radicalism and by positivism. It is not merely that we refuse to attack Christianity because we recognize its necessary adaptation to a certain stage of culture, not yet passed by the average minds of the community; it is that we still regard Christianity as, in the deepest sense, our own religion.

Fiske was a popular lecturer on these topics in his early career, and many of his books from the 1870s were first given to the public in the form of lectures or magazine articles, revised and collected under a general title. Of these, in &quot;The Destiny of Man Viewed in the Light of his Origin&quot; (1884), he argues that intellectual force is a later, higher and more potent thing than bodily strength, leading to a moral and non-selfish line of thought. This intellect may or must be enduring, or at its best immortal. In &quot;The Idea of God as Affected by Modern Knowledge&quot; (1885), Fiske discusses the theistic problem, and declares that the mind of man, as developed, becomes an illuminating indication of the mind of God, which as a great immanent cause includes and controls both physical and moral forces.

Later he turned to historical writings, publishing books such as &quot;The Discovery of America&quot; (1892). In addition, he edited, with James Grant Wilson, &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopædia of American Biography&quot; (1887). He died, worn out by overwork, at Gloucester, Massachusetts, July 4, 1901.

<doc id="195997" wikidata="Q1052428" url="?curid=195997" title="Stations of the Crass">
<text>Stations of the Crass is the second album by Crass, released in 1979. The record, originally released as a double 12&quot;, includes live tracks from a gig recorded at the &quot;Pied Bull&quot; pub in Islington, London, on 7 August 1979. The first three sides contain the studio tracks and play at 45 rpm, while the final side comprises the live material and plays at 33 rpm. The album&#x27;s title is not only a pun on the Catholic rite of the Stations of the Cross (such jibes against the religious establishment were typical of Crass), but is also a reference to the graffiti campaign that the band had been conducting around London&#x27;s underground railway system, the cover artwork depicting a wall at Bond Street tube station that had allegedly been &#x27;decorated&#x27; by them. Although the album met mixed critical reception at first, it managed to sell at least 20,000 copies within two weeks.

A remastered edition of the album, complete with new artwork by Gee Vaucher designed specifically for the small size of a CD case, was due to be released in March 2009, but was delayed because of contentions with former members. The remastered &#x27;Crassical Collection&#x27; version was eventually released in October 2010, including a 64-page booklet of liner notes by Steve Ignorant and Penny Rimbaud, as well as bonus tracks in the form of the band&#x27;s 1979 John Peel Session. The live tracks recorded at the &quot;Pied Bull&quot; are not included on the remastered edition. In 2019, it was re-remastered by Penny Rimbaud at Abbey Road studios and re-released on both LP and CD, with the original cover art and tracklist, including the hidden track and the Pied Bull tracks. The &quot;Crassical Collection&quot; version was reissued in October 2020, including the Pied Bull concert.

==Critical reception==

Graham Lock, when writing for &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, criticized the album in a 1979 review by questioning certain lyrics and the band&#x27;s overall performance. The &quot;Gay Community News&quot; deemed the album &quot;harsh, uncompromising, and between the eyes punk.&quot;

More recent reception towards the album has been mostly warm. Ned Raggett of AllMusic stated that &quot;Crass creates a unique brand of fierce, inspirational music.&quot; In a review for the Sleeping Shaman for the 2010 Crassical Collection edition, Ollie Stygall was very favorable of the album and praised its variety in style. &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, on the other hand, stated that the album&#x27;s tracks &quot;blur into white noise.&quot; Chuck Eddy, in &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Crust Never Sleeps: 8 Anarcho Punk Essentials,&quot; wrote that Crass &quot;vary their often incomprehensibly accented extremist rants with just enough dub, art disco, poetry, and scatology to keep things interesting.&quot;

<doc id="196001" wikidata="Q5971785" url="?curid=196001" title="ILLIAC II">
<text>The ILLIAC II was a revolutionary super-computer built by the University of Illinois that became operational in 1962.

== Description ==
The concept, proposed in 1958, pioneered Emitter-coupled logic (ECL) circuitry, pipelining, and transistor memory with a design goal of 100x speedup compared to ILLIAC I.

ILLIAC II had 8192 words of core memory, backed up by 65,536 words of storage on magnetic drums. The core memory access time was 1.8 to 2 μs. The magnetic drum access time was 8.5ms. A &quot;fast buffer&quot; was also provided for storage of short loops and intermediate results (similar in concept to what is now called cache). The &quot;fast buffer&quot; access time was 0.25 μs.

The word size was 52 bits.

Floating-point numbers used a format with seven bits of exponent (power of 4) and 45 bits of mantissa.

Instructions were either 26 bits or 13 bits long, allowing packing of up to four instructions per memory word.

Rather than naming the pipeline stages, &quot;Fetch, Decode, and Execute&quot; (as on Stretch), the pipelined stages were named, &quot;Advanced Control, Delayed Control, and Interplay&quot;.

== Innovation ==
* The ILLIAC II was one of the first transistorized computers. Like the IBM Stretch computer, ILLIAC II was designed using &quot;future transistors&quot; that had not yet been invented.
* The ILLIAC II project was proposed before, and competed with IBM&#x27;s Stretch project, and several ILLIAC designers felt that Stretch borrowed many of its ideas from ILLIAC II, whose design and documentation were published openly as University of Illinois Tech Reports. Members of the ILLIAC II team jokingly referred to the competing IBM Project as &quot;St. Retch&quot;.
* The ILLIAC II had a division unit designed by faculty member James E. Robertson, a co-inventor of the SRT Division algorithm.
* The ILLIAC II was one of the first pipelined computers, along with IBM&#x27;s Stretch Computer. The pipelined control was designed by faculty member Donald B. Gillies. The pipeline stages were named Advanced Control, Delayed Control, and Interplay.
* The ILLIAC II was the first computer to incorporate Speed-Independent Circuitry, invented by faculty member David E. Muller. Speed-Independent Circuitry is a class of asynchronous digital logic based on the Muller C-element. This digital logic, being asynchronous, runs at full speed of transistor propagation and requires no clocks.

== Discoveries ==
During check-out of the ILLIAC II, before it became fully operational, faculty member Donald B. Gillies programmed ILLIAC II to search for Mersenne prime numbers. The check-out period took roughly 3 weeks, during which the computer verified all the previous Mersenne primes and found three new prime numbers. The results were immortalized for more than a decade on a UIUC Postal Annex cancellation stamp, and were discussed in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, recorded in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, and described in a journal paper in &quot;Mathematics of Computation.

== End of life ==
The ILLIAC II computer was disassembled roughly a decade after its construction. By this time the hundreds of modules were obsolete scrap; many faculty members took components home to keep. Donald B. Gillies kept 12 (mostly control) modules. His family donated 10 of these modules and the front panel to the University of Illinois CS department in 2006. The photos in this article were taken during the time of donation.

Donald W. Gillies, the son of Donald B. Gillies, has a complete set of documentation (instruction set, design reports, research reports, and grant progress reports, roughly 2000 pages) from the ILLIAC II project. He can be contacted for further details about this computer. Most of this documentation should also be available as DCL technical reports in the UIUC Engineering library, although it would not be packaged as a single report.

<text>The Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC) are formed by dividing all possible principal diagnoses (from ICD-9-CM) into 25 mutually exclusive diagnosis areas. MDC codes, like diagnosis-related group (DRG) codes, are primarily a claims and administrative data element unique to the United States medical care reimbursement system. DRG codes also are mapped, or grouped, into MDC codes.

The diagnoses in each MDC correspond to a single organ system or cause and, in general, are associated with a particular medical specialty. MDC 1 to MDC 23 are grouped according to principal diagnoses. Patients are assigned to MDC 24 (Multiple Significant Trauma) with at least two significant trauma diagnosis codes (either as principal or secondaries) from different body site categories. Patients assigned to MDC 25 (HIV Infections) must have a principal diagnosis of an HIV Infection or a principal diagnosis of a significant HIV related condition and a secondary diagnosis of an HIV Infection.

MDC 0, unlike the others, can be reached from a number of diagnosis/procedure situations, all related to transplants. This is due to the expense involved for the transplants so designated and because these transplants can be needed for a number of reasons which do not all come from one diagnosis domain. DRGs which reach MDC 0 are assigned to the MDC for the principal diagnosis instead of to the MDC associated with the designated DRG.

<text>The ILLIAC III was a fine-grained SIMD pattern recognition computer built by the University of Illinois in 1966.

This ILLIAC&#x27;s initial task was image processing of bubble chamber experiments used to detect nuclear particles. Later it was used on biological images.

The machine was destroyed in a fire, caused by a Variac shorting on one of the wooden-top benches, in 1968. It was rebuilt in the early 1970s, and the core parallel-processing element of the machine, the Pattern Articulation Unit, was successfully implemented. In spite of this and the productive exploration of other advanced concepts, such as multiple-radix arithmetic, the project was eventually abandoned.

Bruce H. McCormick was the leader of the project throughout its history. John P. Hayes was responsible for the logic design of the input-output channel control units.

<doc id="196010" wikidata="Q1778694" url="?curid=196010" title="Telecommunications Act of 1996">
<text>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 is a United States federal law enacted by the 104th United States Congress on January 3, 1996, and signed into law on February 8, 1996, by President Bill Clinton. It primarily amended Chapter 5 of Title 47 of the United States Code. The act was the first significant overhaul of United States telecommunications law in more than sixty years, amending the Communications Act of 1934, and represented a major change in that law, because it was the first time that the Internet was added to American regulation of broadcasting and telephony.

The primary goal of the law was to &quot;let anyone enter any communications business – to let any communications business compete in any market against any other.&quot; Thus, the statute is often described as an attempt to deregulate the American broadcasting and telecommunications markets due to technological convergence. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has been praised for incentivizing the expansion of networks and the offering of new services across the United States. At the same time, it is often criticized for enabling market concentration in the media and telecommunications industries.

==Background==
===Development===
Previously, the Communications Act of 1934 was the statutory framework for American communications policy, covering telephony, broadcasting, and (via later amendments) cable television. The 1934 Act created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the agency assigned to implement and administer the economic regulation of the interstate activities of telephone companies (then dominated by the AT&amp;T monopoly) and the licensing of spectrum used for broadcasting and other purposes.

Starting in the 1970s, a combination of technological change, court decisions, and updates to American policy goals enabled competitive entry by new companies into some telecommunications and broadcasting markets. In this context, the 1996 Telecommunications Act was designed to allow smaller companies to enter those markets and for existing companies to operate across market sectors, via the relaxation of cross-ownership rules, multi-sector prohibitions, and other barriers to entry. One specific provision empowered the FCC to preempt all attempts by state or local governments to prevent telecommunications competition. 

A report by the House of Representatives stated that the goal of the new legislation was to &quot;provide for a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced information technologies and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition&quot;.

===New policy developments===
One purpose of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to foster competition among companies willing to provide multiple communications services (such as voice calls and Internet connectivity) within network technologies that has previously been confined by law to one type of service. Therefore, the act created precise regulatory regimes based on type of network architecture, with companies subjected to different regulations depending on whether they operated in telephone, cable television, or Internet networks. The act makes a significant distinction between providers of telecommunications services and information services, with the different regulations to be followed by companies in each sector leading to confusion when those sectors technologically converged in later years.

In order to enable competition, the 1996 Act required incumbent telecommunications companies to interconnect their networks with new competing companies, and to provide wholesale access to materials and components as those smaller companies build their networks. The act also clarified intercarrier compensation rates for communications requests that are handled by multiple firms. Regional Bell Operating Companies, who were previously subjected to strict regulations to provide only local telephone service, were allowed to enter the long-distance market.

The 1996 Act also introduced more precise and detailed regulations for the funding of universal service programs via subsidies generated by monthly customer fees. This was intended to reduce the tendency of smaller telephone firms to charge above-market rates for underserved users, and to provide more transparency of fees charged to customers. However, universal service subsidies were only used to build landline telephone networks until the early 2010s.

In the media and broadcasting sector, most media ownership regulations were eased, and the cap on radio station ownership was eliminated. The act also attempted to prohibit indecency and obscenity on the Internet, via a section that was separately titled as the Communications Decency Act, though most of this section was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court for violating the First Amendment. Portions of Title V remain, including Section 230, which shields Internet firms from liability for the speech of their users, and has been widely credited for enabling the growth of the Internet and social media.

== Opposition ==

=== Early criticism ===
Some smaller telecommunications companies and consumer groups stated their opposition to the new statute during Congressional hearings. For example, smaller firms predicted that they would experience difficulty in competing financially even if they faced fewer barriers to entry, and this would result in market consolidation in favor of incumbent firms. This prediction was correct, and by 2001 concentration of the American telephone market had increased with four major companies owning 85% of all network infrastructure, rather than the increased competition that the act intended. Critics warned that the same would happen in the media content industry.

Consumer activist Ralph Nader argued that the act was an example of corporate welfare spawned by political corruption, because it gave away to incumbent broadcasters valuable licenses for digital broadcasting frequencies on the public airwaves. The act was also unpopular with early Internet activists, and was named specifically in EFF founder John Perry Barlow&#x27;s essay, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace, as an act &quot;which repudiates your own [American] Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis.&quot;

On the other hand, a Brookings Institution study concluded that the act incentivized upgrades to telecommunications infrastructure and new construction, despite increased industry concentration. In the long term, this helped to spread broadband access to more of the country.

=== Later criticism ===
Critics have maintained that many of the purported goals of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not come to fruition in the years and decades after its passage. The act&#x27;s structure of regulations based on type of network infrastructure failed to predict technological convergence and created awkward regulatory burdens for companies operating in multiple segments of media and telecommunications markets. This may prohibit innovation or make the law unable to handle evolving market conditions. The law also fails to provide a guideline for regulating previously separate network technologies that have since converged (e.g. voice calls can now be delivered over Internet networks via services like VoIP). According to some critics, this situation has in fact created re-regulation of the marketplace with contradictory and inconsistent rules for companies to follow.

Critics have also claimed that the act has failed to enable the competition that was one of its stated goals. Instead, it may have inadvertently exacerbated the ongoing consolidation of the media marketplace that had commenced in the decades before the act&#x27;s passage. The number of American major media content companies shrank from about fifty in 1983 to ten in 1996, and to just six in 2005. An FCC study found that the act led to a drastic decline in the number of radio station owners, even as the actual number of stations in the United States increased. This decline in owners and increase in stations has resulted in radio homogenization, in which local programming and content has been lost and content is repeated regardless of location. Activists and critics have cited similar effects in the television industry.

In the 2003 edition of his book &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;, historian Howard Zinn named the act as a significant factor in the loss of alternative and community media, and possibly the loss of public control of information:

There have been attempts by the United States Congress to update the 1996 Telecommunications Act or address some of its shortcomings, such as the Communications Opportunity, Promotion and Enhancement Bill of 2006 and Internet Freedom and Nondiscrimination Act of 2006, but neither became law.

<doc id="196012" wikidata="Q1696188" url="?curid=196012" title="Interexchange carrier">
<text>An interexchange carrier (IXC), in U.S. legal and regulatory terminology, is a type of telecommunications company, commonly called a long-distance telephone company. It is defined as any carrier that provides services across multiple local access and transport areas (interLATA). Calls made on telephone circuits within the local geographic area covered by one local network are handled only by that intraLATA carrier, commonly called a local telephone exchange carrier. Local calls are usually defined by connections made without additional charge whether the connected call is in the same LATA or connects to another LATA with no charge. IntraLATA usually refers to rated or toll calls between LATA within state boundaries, as opposed to interstate, or calls between LATAs in different states.

==Call handling==
An interexchange carrier handles traffic between telephone exchanges. Telephone exchanges are identified in the United States by the three-digit area code (NPA) and the central office prefix, which is the first three digits of the local telephone number (NPA-NXX). Different exchanges, or central offices, generally serve different geographic areas.

For voice traffic transfer, IXCs use Tandem switches and SS7 signaling or softswitches and VoIP protocols and error correction ITSPs can thereby connect between VoIP to POTS, computer to computer, computer to phone, and Internet Protocol devices to other phone services.

== Carrier identification code ==
Each carrier (interexchange or local exchange) is assigned a four-digit identification code, the carrier identification code (CIC) which was used with feature groups. The interexchange carrier to which calls from a subscriber line are routed by default is known as the presubscribed interexchange carrier (PIC). To give telephone users the possibility of opting for a different carrier on a call-by-call basis, carrier access codes (CAC) were devised. These consist of the digits 101 followed by the four-digit CIC. The CAC is dialed as a prefix immediately before dialing a long-distance telephone number.

In popular usage, CACs are often referred to as dial-around codes, because they allow &quot;dialing around&quot; the PIC. Sometimes they are even called &quot;PIC codes&quot;, though this term is inaccurate, since the code is being used to &quot;avoid&quot; the PIC, not to use its services.

When CICs were first introduced in 1983, they were only three digits long, and the CAC consisted of the digits 10 followed by the three-digit CIC. In 1998, the CIC had to be extended to four digits. Existing carriers&#x27; codes were prefixed with 10. Thus, a pre-1998 CAC of the form 10-XXX became 101-0XXX. Since the CACs starting with 10-10 are generally the oldest and best-known ones, CACs are sometimes referred to as 10-10 codes.

<text>Crocodilia () is an order of semiaquatic, predatory reptiles that are known as crocodilians. They first appeared during the Late Cretaceous and are the closest living relatives of birds. Crocodilians are a type of crocodylomorph pseudosuchian, a subset of archosaurs that appeared about 235 million years ago and were the only survivors of the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event. While other crocodylomorph groups further survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, notably sebecosuchians, only the crocodilians have survived into the Quaternary. The order includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term &quot;crocodiles&quot; is sometimes used to refer to all of these families, the term &quot;crocodilians&quot; is less ambiguous.

Extant crocodilians have flat heads with long snouts and tails that are compressed on the sides, with their eyes, ears, and nostrils at the top of the head. Alligators and caimans tend to have broader U-shaped jaws that, when closed, show only the upper teeth, whereas crocodiles usually have narrower V-shaped jaws with both rows of teeth visible when closed. Gharials have extremely slender, elongated jaws. The teeth are conical and peg-like, and the bite is powerful. All crocodilians are good swimmers and can move on land in a &quot;high walk&quot; position, traveling with their legs erect rather than sprawling. Crocodilians have thick skin covered in non-overlapping scales and, like birds, crocodilians have a four-chambered heart and lungs with unidirectional airflow.

Like most other reptiles, crocodilians are ectotherms or &#x27;cold-blooded&#x27;. They are found mainly in the warm and tropical areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania, usually occupying freshwater habitats, though some can live in saline environments and even swim out to sea. Crocodilians have a largely carnivorous diet; some species like the gharial are specialized feeders while others, like the saltwater crocodile, have generalized diets. They are generally solitary and territorial, though they sometimes hunt in groups. During the breeding season, dominant males try to monopolize available females, which lay their eggs in holes or mounds and, like many birds, they care for their hatched young.

Some species of crocodilians, particularly the Nile crocodile, are known to have attacked humans, which through activities that include hunting, poaching, and habitat destruction are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations. Farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in skins of wild-caught animals. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt.

==Spelling and etymology==

&quot;Crocodilia&quot; and &quot;Crocodylia&quot; have been used interchangeably for decades, starting with Schmidt&#x27;s re-description of the group from the formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term &quot;Crocodilia&quot;, based on Richard Owen&#x27;s original name for the group. Wermuth chose &quot;Crocodylia&quot; as the proper name, basing it on the type genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot; (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee, in a revision of many reptilian and amphibian names, argued strongly for &quot;Crocodylia&quot;. Following the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature, a more-solid justification for one spelling over the other was proposed.

Prior to 1988, Crocodilia was a group that encompassed the modern-day animals, as well as their more-distant relatives that are now classified in the larger groups Crocodylomorpha and Pseudosuchia. Under its current definition as a crown group, rather than a stem-based group, Crocodylia is now restricted to the last common ancestor of today&#x27;s crocodilians and all of its descendants, living or extinct.

Crocodilia appears to be a Latinism of the Greek word (), which means both lizard and Nile crocodile. Crocodylia, as coined by Wermuth in regards to the genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot;, appears to be derived from the ancient Greek ()—meaning shingle or pebble—and or (), meaning &quot;worm&quot;. The name may refer to the animal&#x27;s habit of resting on the pebbled shores of the Nile.

==Phylogeny and evolution==
=== Origins from pseudosuchians ===
Crocodilians and birds are members of the clade Archosauria. Archosaurs are distinguished from other reptiles particularly by two sets of extra openings in the skull; the antorbital fenestra located in front of the animal&#x27;s eye socket and the mandibular fenestra on the jaw. Archosauria has two main groups: the Pseudosuchia (crocodilians and their relatives) and the Avemetatarsalia (dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and their relatives). The split between these two groups is assumed to have happened close to the Permian–Triassic extinction event, which is informally known as the Great Dying.

Crocodylomorpha, the group that later give rise to modern crocodilians, emerged in the Late Triassic. The most-basal crocodylomorphs were large, whereas the ones that gave rise to crocodilians were small, slender, and leggy. This evolutionary grade, the &quot;sphenosuchians&quot;, first appeared around Carnian of the Late Triassic. They ate small, fast prey and survived into the Late Jurassic. As the Triassic ended, crocodylomorphs became the only surviving pseudosuchians.

=== Early crocodyliform diversity ===
During the early Jurassic period, dinosaurs became dominant on land and the crocodylomorphs underwent major adaptive diversifications to fill ecological niches vacated by recently extinguished groups. Mesozoic crocodylomorphs had a much greater diversity of forms than modern crocodilians; they became small, fast-moving insectivores, specialist fish-eaters, marine and terrestrial carnivores, and herbivores. The earliest stage of crocodilian evolution was the protosuchians in the late Triassic and early Jurassic, which were followed by the mesosuchians that diversified widely during the Jurassic and the Tertiary. The eusuchians first appeared during the Early Cretaceous; this clade includes modern crocodilians.

Protosuchians were small, mostly terrestrial animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor in the form of two rows of plates extending from head to tail; this armor would still be found in later species. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces. The secondary palate was little developed; it consisted only of a maxilla. The mesosuchians underwent a fusion of the palatine bones to the secondary palate, and a great extension of the nasal passages behind the palatine and in front of the pterygoid bones. This adaptation allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open underwater. The eusuchians continued this process; the interior nostrils now opened through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface. The oldest-known eusuchian is &quot;Hylaeochampsa vectiana&quot; from the Early Cretaceous whose remains occur on the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Planocraniidae, the &quot;hoofed crocodiles&quot;, in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus &quot;Borealosuchus&quot; of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.

=== Diversification of modern crocodilians ===
The three primary branches of Crocodilia had diverged by the Late Cretaceous. The possible earliest-known members of the group may be &quot;Portugalosuchus&quot; and &quot;Zholsuchus&quot; from the Cenomanian-Turonian stages. Some researchers have disputed the classification of &quot;Portugalosuchus&quot;, claiming it may be outside the crown-group crocodilians. The morphology-based phylogenetic analyses, which are based on new neuroanatomical data obtained from its skull using micro-CT scans, suggest this taxon is a crown-group crocodilian and a member of the &#x27;thoracosaurs&#x27; that was recovered as a sister taxon of &quot;Thoracosaurus&quot; within Gavialoidea, though it is uncertain whether &#x27;thoracosaurs&#x27; were true gavialoids.

Definitive alligatoroids first appeared during the Santonian-Campanian stages, while definitive longirostres first appeared during the Maastrichtian stage. The earliest-known alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, which indicates the time of the divergence into the three lineages must have been a pre-Campanian event. Additionally, scientists conclude environmental factors played a major role in the evolution of crocodilians and their ancestors; warmer climate is associated with high evolutionary rates and large body sizes.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s42003-020-01561-53&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Crocodylia is cladistically defined as the last common ancestor of &quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot; (gharial), &quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot; (American alligator), and &quot;Crocodylus rhombifer&quot; (the Cuban crocodile) and all of its descendants. The phylogenetic relationships between crocodilians has been the subject of debate and conflicting results. Many studies and their resulting cladograms (&quot;family trees&quot;) of crocodilians have found the &quot;short-snouted&quot; families of Crocodylidae and Alligatoridae to be close relatives, and the long-snouted Gavialidae is a divergent branch of the tree. The resulting group of short-snouted species, named Brevirostres, was mainly supported by morphological studies that analyzed only skeletal features.

Recent molecular studies using DNA sequencing of living crocodilians have rejected the distinct group Brevirostres; the long-snouted gavialids are more closely related to crocodiles than to alligators, and the new grouping of gavialids and crocodiles is named Longirostres.

Below is a cladogram from 2021 showing the relationships of the major extant crocodilian groups. This analysis was based on mitochondrial DNA, including that of the recently extinct &quot;Voay robustus&quot;:
==Anatomy and physiology==
Though there is diversity in snout and tooth shape, all crocodilian species have essentially the same body morphology. They have solidly built, lizard-like bodies with wide, cylindrical torsos, flat heads, long snouts, short necks, and tails that are compressed from side to side. Their limbs are reduced in size; the front feet have five mostly non-webbed digits, and the hind feet have four webbed digits and an extra fifth. The pelvis and ribs of crocodilians are modified; the cartilaginous processes of the ribs allow the thorax to collapse when submerging and the structure of the pelvis can accommodate large amounts of food, or more air in the lungs. Both sexes have a cloaca, a single chamber and outlet near the tail into which the intestinal, urinary and genital tracts open. It houses the penis in males and the clitoris in females. The crocodilian penis is permanently erect; it relies on cloacal muscles to protrude it, and elastic ligaments and a tendon to retract it. The gonads are located near the kidneys.

Crocodilians range in size from the dwarf caimans and African dwarf crocodiles, which reach , to the saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile, which reach and weigh up to . Some prehistoric species such as the late-Cretaceous &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; were even larger, at up to about and . They tend to be sexually dimorphic; males are much larger than females.

===Locomotion===
Crocodilians are excellent swimmers. During aquatic locomotion, the muscular tail undulates from side to side to drive the animal through the water while the limbs are held close to the body to reduce drag. When the animal needs to stop or change direction, the limbs are splayed out. Swimming is normally achieved with gentle sinuous movements of the tail, but the animals can move more quickly when pursuing or being pursued. Crocodilians are less well-adapted for moving on land, and are unusual among vertebrates in having two means of terrestrial locomotion: the &quot;high walk&quot; and the &quot;low walk&quot;. The ankle joints flex in a different way from those of other reptiles, a feature crocodilians share with some early archosaurs. One of the upper row of ankle bones, the talus bone, moves with the tibia and fibula, while the heel bone moves with the foot and is where the ankle joint is located. The result is the legs can be held almost vertically beneath the body when on land, and the foot swings during locomotion as the ankle rotates.

The limbs move much the same as those of other quadrupeds; the left forelimb moves first, followed by the right hindlimb, then right forelimb, and finally left hindlimb. The high walk of crocodilians, with the belly and most of the tail held off the ground and the limbs held directly under the bodies, resembles that of mammals and birds. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but the body is not raised, and is quite different from the sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. Crocodilians can instantly change from one walk to the other; the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may immediately push up its body up use this form, or it may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel, they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward, so stride length increases while stride duration decreases.

Though they are typically slow on land, crocodilians can produce brief bursts of speed; some can run at for short distances. In some small species, such as the freshwater crocodile, running can progress to galloping, which involves the hind limbs launching the body forward and the fore limbs subsequently taking the weight. Next, the hind limbs swing forward as the spine flexes dorso-ventrally, and this sequence of movements is repeated. During terrestrial locomotion, a crocodilian can keep its back and tail straight because muscles attach the scales to the vertebrae. Whether on land or in water, crocodilians can jump or leap by pressing their tails and hind limbs against the substrate and launching themselves into the air. A fast entry into water from a muddy bank can be effected by plunging to the ground, twisting the body from side to side and splaying out the limbs.

=== Jaws and teeth ===
The snout shape of crocodilians varies between species. Alligators and caimans generally have wide, U-shaped snouts while those of crocodiles are typically narrower and V-shaped. The snouts of the gharials are extremely elongated. The muscles that close the jaws are larger and more powerful than the ones that open them, and a human can quite easily hold shut a crocodilian&#x27;s jaws, but prying open the jaws is extremely difficult. The powerful closing muscles attach at the middle of the lower jaw. The jaw hinge attaches behind the atlanto-occipital joint, giving the animal a wide gape. A folded membrane holds the tongue stationary.
Crocodilians have some of the strongest bite forces in the animal kingdom. In a study published in 2003, an American alligator&#x27;s bite force was measured at up to ; and in a 2012 study, a saltwater crocodile&#x27;s bite force was measured at . This study found no correlation between bite force and snout shape. The gharial&#x27;s extremely slender jaws are relatively weak and are built for quick jaw closure. The bite force of &quot;Deinosuchus&quot; may have measured , even greater than that of theropod dinosaurs like &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;.

Crocodilian teeth vary from dull and rounded to sharp and pointed. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more consistent. In general, in crocodiles and gharials, both rows of teeth are visible when the jaws are closed because their teeth fit into grooves along the outside lining of the upper jaw. By contrast, the lower teeth of alligators and caimans normally fit into holes along the inside lining of the upper jaw, so they are hidden when the jaws are closed. Crocodilians are homodonts, meaning each of their teeth are of the same type; they do not have different tooth types, such as canines and molars. Crocodilians are polyphyodonts; they are able to replace each of their approximately 80 teeth up to 50 times in their 35-to-75-year lifespan. Crocodilians are the only non-mammalian vertebrates with tooth sockets. Next to each full-grown tooth is a small replacement tooth and an odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina that can be activated when required. Tooth replacement slows and eventually stops as the animal ages.

===Sense organs===
The eyes, ears and nostrils of crocodilians are at the top of the head; this placement allows them to stalk their prey with most of their bodies underwater. When in bright light, the pupils of a crocodilian contract into narrow slits, whereas in darkness they become large circles, as is typical for animals that hunt at night. Crocodilians&#x27; eyes have a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; that enhances vision in low light. When the animal completely submerges, the nictitating membranes cover its eyes. Glands on the nictitating membrane secrete a salty lubricant that keeps the eye clean. When a crocodilian leaves the water and dries off, this substance is visible as &quot;tears&quot;. While eyesight in air is fairly good, it is significantly weakened underwater. Crocodilians appear to have undergone a &quot;nocturnal bottleneck&quot; early in their history, during which their eyes lost traits like sclerotic rings, an annular pad of the lens and coloured cone oil droplets, giving them dichromatic vision (red-green colourblindness). Since then, some crocodilians appear to have re-evolved full-colour vision.

The ears are adapted for hearing both in air and underwater, and the eardrums are protected by flaps that can be opened or closed by muscles. Crocodilians have a wide hearing range, with sensitivity comparable to most birds and many mammals. Hearing in crocodilians does not degrade as the animal ages because they can regrow and replace hair cells. The well-developed trigeminal nerve allows them to detect vibrations in water, such as those made by potential prey. Crocodilians have a single olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ disappears when they reach adulthood. Behavioural and olfactometer experiments indicate crocodiles detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals, and use their olfactory system for hunting. When above water, crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx. Crocodiles appear to have lost their pineal organ but still show signs of melatonin rhythms.

===Skin and scales===

The skin of crocodilians is clad in non-overlapping scales known as scutes that are covered by beta-keratin. Many of the scutes are strengthened by bony plates known as osteoderms. Scutes are most numerous on the back and neck of the animal. The belly and underside of the tail have rows of broad, flat, square-shaped scales. Between crocodilian scales are hinge areas that consist mainly of alpha-keratin. Underneath the surface, the dermis is thick with collagen. Both the head and jaws lack scales and are instead covered in tight, keratinised skin that is fused directly to the bones of the skull and which, over time, develop a pattern of cracks as the skull develops. The skin on the neck and sides is loose. The scutes contain blood vessels and may act to absorb or release heat during thermoregulation. Research also suggests alkaline ions released into the blood from the calcium and magnesium in the dermal bones act as a buffer during prolonged submersion when increasing levels of carbon dioxide would otherwise cause acidosis.

Some scutes contain a single pore known as an integumentary sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, but it has been suggested they may be mechanosensory organs. There are prominent, paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested; they may play a part in communication—indirect evidence suggests they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days. In the genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot;, the skin contains chromatophores, allowing animals to change colour from dark to light and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

===Circulation===
Crocodilians may have the most-complex vertebrate circulatory system with a four-chambered heart and two ventricles, an unusual trait among extant reptiles. Both have left and right aorta are connected by a hole called the Foramen of Panizza. Like birds and mammals, crocodilians have vessels that separately direct blood flow to the lungs and the rest of the body. They also have unique, cog-teeth-like valves that when interlocked direct blood to the left aorta and away from the lungs, and then around the body. This system may allow the animals to remain submerged for a lengthy period, but this explanation has been questioned. Other possible reasons for the peculiar circulatory system include assistance with thermoregulatory needs, prevention of pulmonary oedema, and quick recovery from metabolic acidosis. Retention of carbon dioxide within the body permits an increase in the rate of gastric acid secretion and thus the efficiency of digestion, and other gastrointestinal organs such as the pancreas, spleen, small intestine, and liver also function more efficiently.

When submerged, a crocodilian&#x27;s heart may beat at only once or twice a minute, with little blood flow to the muscle. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate almost immediately increases and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, crocodilians have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. While diving, an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen for the muscles.

===Respiration===
Crocodilians were traditionally thought to breathe like mammals, with airflow tidally moving in and out, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude respiration in crocodilians is more bird-like, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. During inhalation, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi (airways) that divide into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways that were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled.

In crocodilians, the diaphragmaticus muscle, which is analogous to the diaphragm in mammals, attaches the lungs to the liver and pelvis. During inhalation, the external intercostal muscles expand the ribs, allowing the animal to take in more air, while the ischiopubis muscle causes the hips to swing downwards and push the belly outward, while the diaphragmaticus pulls the liver back. When exhaling, the internal intercostal muscles push the ribs inwards while the rectus abdominis pulls the hips and liver forwards and the belly inward. Crocodilians can also use these muscles to adjust the position of their lungs, controlling their buoyancy in the water. An animal sinks when the lungs are pulled towards the tail and floats when they move back towards the head. This allows them to move through the water without creating disturbances that could alert potential prey. They can also spin and twist by moving their lungs laterally.

When swimming and diving, crocodilians appear to rely on lung volume for buoyancy mare than for oxygen storage. Just before diving, the animal exhales to reduce its lung volume and reach negative buoyancy. When diving, the nostrils of a crocodilian shut tight. All species have a palatal valve, a membranous flap of skin at the back of the oral cavity (mouth) that protects the oesophagus and trachea when the animal is underwater. This enables them to open their mouths underwater without drowning. Crocodilians typically remain underwater for up to fifteen minutes, but under ideal conditions, some can hold their breath for up to two hours. The depth to which crocodilians can dive is unknown, but crocodiles can dive to at least .

Crocodilians vocalize by vibrating vocal folds in the larynx. The folds of the American alligator have a complex morphology consisting of epithelium, lamina propria and muscle, and according to Riede &quot;et al&quot;. (2015): &quot;it is reasonable to expect species-specific morphologies in vocal folds/analogues as far back as basal reptiles&quot;. Although crocodilian vocal folds lack the elasticity of mammalian ones, the larynx is still capable of complex motor control similar to that in birds and mammals, and can adequately control its fundamental frequency.

===Digestion===
Crocodilian teeth can only hold onto prey, and food is swallowed unchewed. The stomach consists of a grinding gizzard and a digestive chamber. Indigestible items are regurgitated as pellets. The stomach is more acidic than that of any other vertebrate and contains ridges for gastroliths, which play a role in the crushing of food. Digestion takes place more quickly at higher temperatures. When digesting a meal, CO2-rich blood near the lungs is redirected to the stomach, supplying more acid for the oxyntic glands. Compared to crocodiles, alligators digest more carbohydrates relative to protein. Crocodilians have a very low metabolic rate and thus low energy requirements. They can withstand extended fasting by living on stored fat. Even recently hatched crocodiles are able to survive 58 days without food, losing 23% of their bodyweight during this time.

===Thermoregulation===
Crocodilians are ectotherms (&#x27;cold-blooded&#x27;), relying mostly on their environment to control their body temperature. The main means of warming is sun&#x27;s heat, while immersion in water may either raise its temperature via thermal conduction or cool the animal in hot weather. The main method for regulating its temperature is behavioural; temperate-living alligators may start the day by basking in the sun on land and move into water for the afternoon, with parts of the back breaking the surface so it can still be warmed by the sun. At night, it remains submerged and its temperature slowly falls. The basking period is longer in winter. Tropical crocodiles bask briefly in the morning and move into water for rest of the day. They may return to land at nightfall when the air cools. Animals also cool themselves by gaping the mouth, which cools by evaporation from the mouth lining. By these means, the temperature range of crocodilians is usually maintained between , and mainly stays in the range .

Both the American and Chinese alligator can be found in areas that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. In cold weather, alligators remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less-cold water and their nostrils projecting just above the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, and there have been occasions when their snouts have become frozen into ice. Temperature-sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found their core body temperatures can fall to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe, they show no ill effects when the weather warms.

===Osmoregulation===

All crocodilians need to maintain a suitable concentration of salt in body fluids. Osmoregulation is related to the quantity of salts and water that are exchanged with the environment. Intake of water and salts occurs across the lining of the mouth, when water is drunk, incidentally while feeding, and when present in foods. Water is lost during breathing, and salts and water are lost in the urine and faeces, through the skin, and in crocodiles and gharials via salt-excreting glands on the tongue. The skin is a largely effective barrier water and ions. Gaping causes water loss by evaporation. Large animals are better able than small ones to maintain homeostasis at times of osmotic stress. Newly hatched crocodilians are much less tolerant of exposure to salt water than are older juveniles, presumably because they have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio.

The kidneys and excretory system are much the same as those in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution&#x27;s osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher than that of the surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, and nitrogen is excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly occurs through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true; the osmolality in the plasma is lower than that of the surrounding water, causing the animal to dehydrate. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, and nitrogenous waste is mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.

==Distribution and habitat==
Crocodilians are , living both in water and on land. The last-surviving, fully terrestrial genus &quot;Mekosuchus&quot; became extinct about 3,000 years ago after humans had arrived on the Pacific islands it inhabited, making the extinction possibly anthropogenic. Crocodilians are typically creatures of the tropics; the main exceptions are the American and Chinese alligators, whose ranges are the southeastern United States and the Yangtze River, respectively. Florida, United States, is the only place where the ranges of crocodiles and alligators coincide. Crocodilians live almost exclusively in lowland habitiat, and do not appear to live above . With a range extending from eastern India to New Guinea and northern Australia, the saltwater crocodile is the widest-spread species.

Crocodilians use various types of aquatic habitats. Due to their diet, gharials are found in pools and backwaters of rapidly flowing rivers. Caimans prefer warm, turbid lakes and ponds, and slow-moving parts of rivers, although the dwarf caiman inhabits cool, relatively clear, fast-flowing waterways, often near waterfalls. The Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers that flow across China&#x27;s floodplains. The highly adaptable American alligator is found in swamps, rivers and lakes with clear or turbid water. Crocodiles live in marshes, lakes and rivers, and can live in saline environments including estuaries and mangrove swamps. American and saltwater crocodiles swim out to sea. Several extinct species, including the recently extinct &quot;Ikanogavialis papuensis&quot;, which occurred in coastlines of the Solomon Islands, had marine habitats. Climatic factors locally affect crocodilians&#x27; distribution. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted for several months to deep pools in rivers; in the rainy season, much of the savanna in the Orinoco Llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. West African crocodiles in the deserts of Mauritania mainly live in gueltas and floodplains but they retreat underground and to rocky shelters, and enter aestivation during the driest periods.

Crocodilians also use terrestrial habitats such as forests, savannas, grasslands and deserts. Dry land is used for basking, nesting and escaping from temperature extremes. Several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool or warm, depending on the environment. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. Tropical rainforests bordering rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians are of great importance to them, creating microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb rainwater and slowly release it back into the environment. This keeps crocodilian habitat moist during the dry season while preventing flooding during the wet season.

==Behaviour and life history==

Adult crocodilians are typically territorial and solitary. Individuals may guard basking spots, nesting sites, feeding areas, nurseries, and overwintering sites. Male saltwater crocodiles defend areas with several female nesting sites year-round. Some species are occasionally gregarious, particularly during droughts, when several individuals gather at remaining water sites. Individuals of some species may share basking sites at certain times of the day.

===Feeding===
Crocodilians are largely carnivorous. The diets of species varies with snout shape and tooth sharpness. Species with sharp teeth and long, slender snouts, like the Indian gharial and Australian freshwater crocodile, are specialized for snapping fish, insects, and crustaceans. Extremely broad-snouted species with blunt teeth, like the Chinese alligator and the broad-snouted caiman, are equipped for crushing hard-shelled molluscs. Species whose snouts and teeth are intermediate between these two forms, such as the saltwater crocodile and American alligator, have generalized diets and opportunistically feed on invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Though mostly carnivorous, several species of crocodilian have been observed consuming fruit, and this may play a role in seed dispersal.

In general, crocodilians are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies vary between species an their prey. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water&#x27;s edge, and grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws from side-to-side to snatch prey; these animals can leap out of water to catch birds, bats and leaping fish. A small prey animal can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. When foraging for fish in shallow water, caiman use their tails and bodies to herd fish and may dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates. The smooth-fronted caiman will leave water to hunt terrestrial prey.

Crocodilians are unable to chew and need to swallow food whole, so prey that is too large to swallow is torn into pieces. Crocodilians may be unable to deal with a large animal with a thick hide, and may wait until it becomes putrid and comes apart more easily. To tear a chunk of tissue from a large carcass, a crocodilian continuously spins its body while holding prey with its jaws, a manoeuvrer that is known as the &quot;death roll&quot;. During cooperative feeding, some individuals may hold onto prey while others perform the roll. The animals do not fight, and each retires with a piece of flesh and awaits its next feeding turn. After feeding together, individuals may depart alone. Crocodilians typically consume prey with their heads above water. The food is held with the tips of the jaws, tossed towards the back of the mouth by an upward jerk of the head and then gulped down. There is no hard evidence crocodilians cache kills for later consumption.

===Reproduction and parenting===
Crocodilians are generally polygynous, and individual males try to mate with as many females as they can. Monogamous pairings of American alligators have been recorded. Dominant male crocodilians patrol and defend territories, which contain several females. Males of some species, like the American alligator, try to attract females with elaborate courtship displays. During courtship, crocodilian males and females may rub against each other, circle around, and perform swimming displays. Copulation typically occurs in water. When a female is ready to mate, she arches her back while her head and tail dip underwater. The male rubs across the female&#x27;s neck and grasps her with his hindlimbs, and places his tail underneath hers so their cloacas align and his penis can be inserted. Intermission can last up to 15 minutes, during which time the pair continuously submerge and surface. While dominant males usually monopolise females, single American alligator clutches can be sired by three different males.

Depending on the species, female crocodilians may construct either holes or mounds as nests, the latter made from vegetation, litter, sand or soil. Nests are typically found near dens or caves. Those made by different females are sometimes close to each other, particularly in hole-nesting species. Clutches may contain between ten and fifty eggs. Crocodilian eggs are protected by hard shells made of calcium carbonate. The incubation period is two to three months. The sex of the developing, incubating young is temperature dependant; constant nest temperatures above produce more males, while those below produce more females. Sex in crocodilians may be established in a short period of time, and nests are subject to changes in temperature. Most natural nests produce hatchlings of both sexes, though single-sex clutches occur.

All of the hatchlings in a clutch may leave the nest on the same night. Crocodilians are unusual among reptiles in the amount of parental care provided after the young hatch. The mother helps excavate hatchlings from the nest and carries them to water in her mouth. Newly hatched crocodilians gather together and follow their mother. Both male and female adult crocodilians will respond to vocalizations by hatchlings. Female spectacled caimans in the Venezuelan Llanos are known to leave their young in nurseries or crèches, and one female guards them. Hatchlings of some species tend to bask in a group during the day and start to forage separately in the evening. The time it takes young crocodilians to reach independence can vary. For American alligators, groups of young associate with adults for one-to-two years while juvenile saltwater and Nile crocodiles become independent in a few months.

===Communication===
Crocodilians are the most vocal of the non-avian reptiles. They can communicate with sounds, including barks, bellows, chirps, coughs, growls, grunts, hisses, moos, roars, toots and whines. Young start communicating with each other before they are hatched. It has been shown the young will repeat, one after another, a light tapping noise near the nest. This early communication may help young to hatch simultaneously. After breaking out of the egg, a juvenile produces yelps and grunts, either spontaneously or as a result of external stimuli. Even unrelated adults respond quickly to juvenile distress calls.

Juveniles are highly vocal, both when scattering in the evening and congregating in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, may warn young of predators or alert them to the presence of food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators and caimans are the noisiest while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. In some crocodile species, individuals &quot;roar&quot; at others when they get too close. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of up to seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten-second intervals. It also makes various grunts, growls and hisses. Males create vibrations in water to send out infrasonic signals that attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.

The head slap is another form of acoustic communication. This typically starts when an animal in water elevates its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are sharply opened then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud, slapping sound that is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may immerse below the surface and blow bubbles from the throat or nostrils. Some species then roar while others slap water with their tails. Episodes of head slapping spread through the group. The purpose varies and it seems have a social function, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals intimidate rivals by swimming at the surface and displaying their large body size, and subordinates submit by holding their head forward above water with the jaws open and then flee below.

===Growth and mortality===
Eggs and hatchlings have a high death rate, and nests face threats from floods, drying, overheating, and predators. Flooding is a major cause of failure of crocodilians to successfully breed; nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen and juveniles are swept away. Despite the maternal care they receive, eggs and hatchlings are commonly lost to predation. Predators, both mammalian and reptilian, may raid nests and eat crocodilian eggs. After hatching and reaching water, young are still under threat. 

In addition to terrestrial predators, young are subject to aquatic attacks by fish. Birds take their toll, and malformed individuals are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is 25 percent but this improves with each year of life, reaching up to 60 percent by year five. Mortality rates among subadults and adults are low, though they are occasionally preyed upon by large cats and snakes. Elephants and hippopotamuses may defensively kill crocodiles. Authorities are uncertain how much cannibalism occurs among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles, while subadults may be preyed on by adults. Adults appear more likely to protect juveniles and may chase away subadults from nurseries. Rival male Nile crocodiles sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.

Growth in hatchlings and young crocodilians depends on the food supply. Animals reach sexual maturity at a certain length, regardless of age. Saltwater crocodiles reach maturity at for females and for males. Australian freshwater crocodiles take ten years to reach maturity at . The spectacled caiman matures earlier, reaching its mature length of in four to seven years. Crocodilians continue to grow throughout their lives; males in particular continue to gain weight as they age, but this is mostly in the form of extra girth rather than length. Crocodilians can live for 35–75 years; their age can be determined by growth rings in their bones.

=== Cognition ===
Crocodilians are among the most cognitively complex non-avian reptiles. Embryological studies of developing amniotes have shown similar brain structures in the telencephalon between crocodilians, mammals and birds. Accordingly, several behaviours that were once thought to be unique to mammals and birds have been recently discovered in crocodilians. Some crocodilian species have been observed using sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds, though other authors have argued the purpose, if any, of stick-displaying is at best ambiguous. Several species have been observed to hunt cooperatively, herding and chasing prey. Play, or the free, intrinsically motivated activity of young individuals, has been observed on numerous occasions in crocodilians in captive and wild settings; young alligators and crocodiles regularly engage in object play and social play. Not all higher social behaviours are endemic across these clades; a 2023 study of a tinamou bird and American alligator test subjects found alligators do not appear to engage in visual perspective-taking like the birds. Some researchers have proposed an increase in the use of crocodilians as test animals in comparative cognition studies.

==Interactions with humans==
===Attacks===

Crocodilians are opportunistic predators that are at their most dangerous in water and on shorelines. Several species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests or young; these attacks occur either unintentionally while the animal is attacking domestic animals such as dogs, or deliberately for food. Large crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. Most of the data about such attacks involve the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the American alligator and the black caiman. Other species that often attack humans are Morelet&#x27;s crocodile and the spectacled caiman.

It is estimated over 1,000 attacks by the Nile crocodile occurred between 2010 and 2020, almost 70% of which were fatal. The species is considered to be the most-dangerous large predator in Africa, particularly because it is both widespread and numerous. It can easily sneak up on people or domestic animals at the edge of water. Fishers, bathers, waders and those washing clothes are particularly vulnerable. Once grabbed and dragged into water, it is unlikely the victim will escape. Analysis of attacks show most-such attacks take place when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. 

Saltwater crocodiles have been implicated in over 1,300 attacks on humans between 2010 and 2020, almost half of which fatal. Animals of various sizes may attack humans but large males are generally responsible for fatalities. Large animals require large prey, and humans are the correct size. Most victims of attacks by saltwater crocodile attacks have been in water but they occasionally occur on land. Saltwater crocodiles sometimes attack boats but do not usually appear to be targeting the occupants. Attacks may occur when a human encroaches on the crocodile&#x27;s territory. American alligators were responsible for 127 recorded attacks between 2010 and 2020, only six of which were fatal. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than Nile and saltwater crocodiles, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into proximity, increasing the risk of alligator attacks.

===Uses===

Crocodilians have been hunted for their skin, meat and bones. Their tough skin has been used to make handbags, coats, footwear, wallets and other items. The meat has been compared to that of chicken and may be used as an aphrodisiac. The bones, teeth and pickled heads of crocodilians are used as souvenirs, while other tissues and fluids are ingredients in traditional medicine. Crocodile farms have been established to meet the demand for crocodilian products; species bred on these farms are listed under Appendix II of CITES, which allows regulated trade. A study examining alligator farms in the United States showed they have generated significant conservation gains and poaching of wild alligators has greatly diminished.

Several species of crocodilian are traded as exotic pets. They are appealing when young but crocodilians do not make good pets; they grow large, and are dangerous and expensive to keep. As they grow older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners, and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in the United States and Cuba. Most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles.

The blood of alligators and crocodiles contains peptides with antibiotic properties that may contribute to future antibacterial drugs. Cartilage from farm-raised crocodiles is used in research aiming to 3D-print new cartilage for humans by mixing human stem cells with liquefied crocodile cartilage after proteins that may trigger the human immune system have been removed.

==Conservation==
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species recognises 26 species of crocodilian and classes 11 of them as threatened including:

* Critically Endangered: Chinese alligator, Philippine Crocodile, Orinoco crocodile, Siamese crocodile, Cuban Crocodile, African Slender-snouted crocodile and gharial.
* Endangered: False gharial
* Vulnerable: American crocodile, mugger crocodile, and dwarf crocodile.

The main threat to crocodilians worldwide is human activity, including hunting and habitat destruction. Early in the 1970s, more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins had been traded, depleting the majority of crocodilian populations, in some cases almost to extinction. Starting in 1973, CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals, such as crocodile skins. This proved to be problematic in the 1980s because in some parts of Africa, crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans, and hunting them was legal. At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983, it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people the selling of lawfully hunted skins was reasonable. In the late 1970s, crocodile farming began in different countries, starting from eggs taken from the wild. By the 1980s, farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to greatly diminish the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians. By 2000, skins from twelve crocodilian species, whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed, were traded by thirty countries and the unlawful trade had almost vanished.

The gharial was historically widespread in the major river systems of India but has undergone a chronic decline since 1943. Major threats have included prolific hunting, accidental catching and water blockage from dams. The gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites. Protection of nests against egg predators has been shown to increase population numbers. The Chinese alligator was historically widespread in the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in south-eastern Anhui due to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small, fragmented ponds. In 1972, the Chinese government declared the species a Class I endangered species and it received the maximum amount of legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programmes were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The Philippine crocodile may be the most-threatened crocodilian; hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its numbers to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive-bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species&#x27; survival.

The American alligator has also undergone serious declines from hunting and habitat loss throughout its range, threatening it with extinction. In 1967, it was listed as an endangered species but the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies in the southern United States stepped in and worked towards its recovery. Protection allowed the species to recuperate and in 1987 it was removed from the endangered species list. In Australia, the saltwater crocodile was heavily hunted and was reduced to five percent of its historical numbers in the Northern Territory by 1971. Since then, the species was given legal protections and its numbers had greatly increased by 2001.

==Cultural depictions==
===In mythology and folklore===
Crocodilians have prominent roles in the narratives of various cultures around the world and may have inspired stories of dragons. In Ancient Egyptian religion, both Ammit the devourer of unworthy souls and Sobek the god of power, protection and fertility are represented as having crocodile heads. This reflects Ancient Egyptians&#x27; view of the crocodile as both a terrifying predator and an important part of the Nile ecosystem. The crocodile was one of several animals the Egyptians mummified. West African peoples also associated crocodiles with water deities. During the Benin Empire, crocodiles symbolised the power of the &quot;oba&quot; (king) and linked him to the life-giving rivers. The Leviathan described in the Book of Job may have been based on a crocodile. In Mesoamerica, the Aztecs had a crocodilian god of fertility named Cipactli who protected crops. In Aztec mythology, the earth deity Tlaltecuhtli is send to bond with a &quot;great caiman&quot;. The Maya also worshipped crocodilian gods and believed the world is supported on the back of a swimming crocodile. 

The gharial features in the folk tales of India. In one story, a gharial and a monkey become friends when the monkey gives the gharial fruit but the friendship ends after the gharial confesses it tried to lure the monkey into a house to eat it. Native American and African American folk tales often pair an alligator with a trickster rabbit; Br&#x27;er Rabbit in the African American stories. An Australian Dreamtime story tells of a crocodile ancestor who had fire all to himself until a rainbow bird stole fire-sticks for man; hence the crocodile lives in water.

===In literature and media===
Ancient historians have described crocodilians from the earliest written records, though often their descriptions contain as much assumption as observation. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus (c. 440 BC) described the crocodile in detail, though much of his description is fanciful; he claimed the crocodile would lie with its mouth open to permit a &quot;trochilus&quot; bird, possibly an Egyptian plover, to remove leeches. The crocodile was described in the late-13th century Rochester Bestiary, which is based on classical sources, including Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Historia naturalis&quot; (c. 79 AD) and Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologies&quot;. Isidore said the crocodile is named for its saffron colour (Latin croceus, &#x27;saffron&#x27;) and may be killed by fish with serrated crests sawing into its soft underbelly.

Since the ninth-century text &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; by Photios I of Constantinople, crocodiles have been reputed to weep for their victims. The story became widely known in 1400 when the English traveller John Mandeville wrote his description of &quot;cockodrills&quot;:

In that country [of Prester John] and by all Ind [India] be great plenty of cockodrills, that is a manner of a long serpent, as I have said before. And in the night they dwell in the water, and on the day upon the land, in rocks and in caves. And they eat no meat in all the winter, but they lie as in a dream, as do the serpents. These serpents slay men, and they eat them weeping; and when they eat they move the over jaw, and not the nether jaw, and they have no tongue.

Crocodilians have been recurring characters in stories for children, such as Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;The Enormous Crocodile&quot; (1978) and Emily Gravett&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Egg&quot; (2008). Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) contains the poem &quot;How Doth the Little Crocodile&quot;. In J. M. Barrie&#x27;s novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; (1911), Captain Hook losses his hand to a crocodile. In Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot; (1902), the Elephant&#x27;s Child acquires his trunk by having his nose pulled very hard by a crocodile.

In movies and shows, crocodilians are often represented as dangerous water obstacles or as monstrous man-eaters, as in the horror films &quot;Eaten Alive&quot; (1977), &quot;Alligator&quot; (1980), &quot;Lake Placid&quot; (1999), &quot;Crocodile&quot; (2000), &quot;Primeval&quot; (2007) and &quot;Black Water&quot; (2007). In the film &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; (1986), the title character Mick Dundee&#x27;s nickname comes from the animal that bit off his leg. Some media texts, such as Steve Irwin&#x27;s wildlife documentary series &quot;The Crocodile Hunter&quot;, have attempted to portray crocodiles in more positive or educational tone.

<text>Case mix, also casemix and patient mix, is a term used within epidemiology as a synonym for cohort; essentially, a case mix groups statistically related patients. An example case mix might be male patients under the age of 50, who present with a myocardial infarction and also undergo emergency coronary artery bypass surgery.

At a local level, such as a single hospital; the data within a case mix may relate to the activity of an individual consultant, a specific speciality or a particular unit (such as a ward). On a wider level; it is possible to compare the case mix of hospitals, regions, and even countries. Whilst a case mix will often include a condition or diagnosis, as well as any treatment received; it can also include demographics, such as gender or age, and a specific time range.

Conditions and treatments are often captured using a medical classification system, such as ICD-10, in a process called clinical coding. The practice of coding, essentially groups patients using statistical codes. The coded data can be grouped further into Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs), which are used in the billing process by hospitals and practices; as the &quot;cost per item&quot; of healthcare is based on the casemix.

==Background==
Prior to the introduction of nationally consistent Activity Based Funding (ABF) by the Commonwealth Government, Casemix based funding was the key funding model used in Australian health care services for reimbursement of the cost of patient care.

In the Netherlands, the casemix system is called a &quot;DBC&quot; (Dutch:&quot;Diagnosebehandelcombinatie&quot;), and can be defined as a predefined average care package, which is applied with a fixed price when a specific diagnosis occurs.

Casemix is a system that measures hospital performance, aiming to reward initiatives that increase efficiency in hospitals. It also serves as an information tool that allows policy makers to understand the nature and complexity of health care delivery.

Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) is the best-known classification system that is used in this funding model. It classifies acute inpatient episodes into a number of manageable categories based on clinical condition and resource consumption. A single acute episode of inpatient care is allocated to one DRG using coded clinical information derived from the patient’s medical record. This information is coded by the Health Information Managers in order to allocate a DRG. Each DRG is allocated a ‘weight’, which is dependent on the average cost of inputs (e.g. nursing, diagnostic services, procedures) required to achieve the appropriate patient outcome. The facility is reimbursed a predetermined amount for each patient episode.

==Risks and opportunities==
Casemix systems and in particular DRG systems mean that a lump sum is paid based on a diagnosis (and maybe particular treatment aspects). Comorbidity may trigger an increase in the sum paid. Such systems tend to set the incentive to provide treatment at the lowest possible costs, and to have many treatment cases in order to improve the revenues of the health provider. Also expensive cases that could have complications are avoided, and side diagnose left for treatment in separate stays. Further, there is an ongoing struggle between those using the comorbidity of increase the price in individual cases, and those who calculate the price that is going to be paid for a particular case group in the following year.
Casemix systems are liked by economists because they may effectively reduce the costs of treatment. However, in order to ensure that the quality of treatment does not suffer from attempts by service providers to reduce the costs of cases, extensive monitoring of outcome quality is essential. 
Casemix systems come with costs for administration for the quality monitoring systems, for the cost calculating institutes, and for keeping diagnosis and procedure coding schemes up to date. Unfortunately these costs are never mentioned in the reports.
A side effect of casemix is also the shortening of the stay of patients and some increased time for administrative work in hospitals. As such, the so beneficial time between health providers and patients is considerably reduced. Also, the focus of attention shifts from a holistic view of a human patient to &#x27;a disease that is treated&#x27;.

==Classification systems==
The casemix system introduces a kind of Activity Based Costing to the health profession. However the complexities of the system (in the Netherlands, over 100,000 DBC&#x27;s can be theoretically charged) has led new initiatives to link billable activities directly to international standards, such as the ICD-10. This will eventually allow the billing processes to become more aligned in their classification schemes with the electronic patient record.

==Casemix systems for mental health==
Because mental health treatment does not lend itself to fixed price costing, other exceptions are made by insurance companies for payment in the case of longer term casemix averages.

<doc id="196027" wikidata="Q65385" url="?curid=196027" title="Hans Bernd Gisevius">
<text>Hans Bernd Gisevius (14 July 1904 – 23 February 1974) was a German diplomat and intelligence officer during the Second World War. A covert opponent of the Nazi regime, he served as a liaison in Zürich between Allen Dulles, station chief for the American OSS, and the German Resistance forces in Germany.

==Pre Second World War==
Gisevius was born in Arnsberg in the Prussian Province of Westphalia. After law school, he joined the Prussian Interior Ministry in 1933 and was assigned to the newly formed &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot;, or Gestapo. After joining the Gestapo, he immediately had disagreements with his senior, Rudolf Diels, and was discharged. He continued with police work in the Interior Ministry. When Heinrich Himmler took over Police functions in 1936 in the German Reich, he removed Gisevius from office.

Throughout his time working for the Gestapo, Gisevius described himself as living in constant fear, entering and exiting through the back door, clutching a pistol at his side – all resultant from his misgivings with the terror apparatus to which he was assigned, since according to him, it was like &quot;living in a den of murderers&quot;. Gisevius later transferred to the Reich Ministry of the Interior. Although he had no position of power, he maintained connections, notably to Arthur Nebe, that kept him informed of the political background. Gisevius joined the secret opposition to Adolf Hitler, began gathering evidence of Nazi crimes (for use in a later prosecution) and attempted to restrain the increasing power of Himmler and the SS. He maintained links with Hans Oster and Hjalmar Schacht.

==Second World War==
When the Second World War started, Gisevius joined the German intelligence service, the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, which was headed by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, who was secretly an opponent of Hitler. Canaris had surrounded himself with Wehrmacht officers opposed to Hitler and he welcomed Gisevius into this group. Working from the consulate in Zürich, Hans Gisevius was involved in secret talks with the Vatican. Canaris arranged for appointment of Gisevius as Vice Consul in Switzerland, where Gisevius met with Allen Dulles in 1943 and agreed to serve as a liaison for the German opposition to Hitler, an assembly which counted among its members General Ludwig Beck, &quot;Abwehr&quot; Chief Canaris, and Mayor Carl Goerdeler of Leipzig. Several members of the conspiratorial circle against Hitler including Gisevius, &quot;all kept homes within easy walking distance of each other.&quot; According to Gisevius, the original plot to kill Hitler earlier (namely, before the acquiescence of Great Britain over the Sudetenland) was utterly derailed by Neville Chamberlain whose actions he claims &quot;saved Hitler.&quot;

Upon returning to Germany, he was investigated by the Gestapo, but released. In 1944, after the failed 20 July assassination attempt against Hitler, Gisevius first hid at the home of his future wife, the Swiss national Gerda Woog, and fled to Switzerland in 1945, making him one of the few conspirators to survive the war. There, he contacted the Swiss authorities.

Peter Hoffmann&#x27;s biography of Hitler assassination conspirator Claus von Stauffenberg (&quot;Stauffenberg, A Family History,&quot; 1992) indicates that after the failure of Stauffenberg&#x27;s bomb plot in July 1944, Gisevius went into hiding until 23 January 1945, when he escaped to Switzerland by using a passport that had belonged to Carl Deichmann, a brother-in-law of German Count Helmuth James von Moltke, who was a specialist in international law serving in the legal branch of the Foreign Countries Group of the OKW (&quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot;, &quot;Supreme Command of the Armed Forces&quot;). Through the help of the American Allen Dulles in Berne, Switzerland and of the German Legation (in Berne)&#x27;s Georg Federer, the passport was modified and a visa obtained for Gisevius that enabled him to escape to Spain.

==Later life==
Gisevius served as a key witness for the defence at the Nuremberg trials when he was called as a witness by defendants Hjalmar Schacht and Wilhelm Frick. His testimony was crucial in securing the acquittal of Schacht on all counts, but Frick was found guilty and executed. His testimony was also particularly damaging to Hermann Göring, Wilhelm Keitel and Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who were all convicted and sentenced to death.

His autobiography, &quot;Bis zum bitteren Ende&quot; (&quot;To the Bitter End&quot;), published by Wasmuth in 1948, offered a sharp indictment of both the Nazi regime, many of whose leading members Gisevius knew personally, and the German people. Gisevius claimed that the latter pretended not to know about the atrocities being committed in their name. At the same time, the book also offers an insider&#x27;s account of the German resistance movement.

In 1946, Gisevius was charged and acquitted by the Swiss authorities in a trial for espionage. Gisevius was later criticised as he diminished the contributions of other members (such as Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg) of the opposition to Hitler. Gisevius wrote in his 1948 book that he considered SS Chief Himmler somewhat of a hypocrite whereas he saw Reinhard Heydrich as one who epitomised Nazi ideals. In the early 1950s, he moved to the United States and lived in Dallas, Texas, but soon returned to Europe and lived in Switzerland. Gisevius died in Müllheim in Baden-Württemberg in 1974.

<text>The Ket ( ) language, or more specifically Imbak and formerly known as Yenisei Ostyak ( ), is a Siberian language long thought to be an isolate, the sole surviving language of a Yeniseian language family. It is spoken along the middle Yenisei basin by the Ket people.

The language is threatened with extinction—the number of ethnic Kets that are native speakers of the language dropped from 1,225 in 1926 to 537 in 1989. According to the UNESCO census, this number has since fallen to 150. A 2005 census reported 485 native speakers, but this number is suspected to be inflated. According to a local news source, the number of remaining Ket speakers is around 10 to 20. Another Yeniseian language, Yugh, has recently become extinct.

== History ==

=== Documentation ===
The earliest observations about the language were published by Peter Simon Pallas in 1788 in a travel diary (, ). Matthias Castrén was one of the last known to study the Kott language. Castrén lived beside the Kan river with five people of Kott, in which is believed were the last remaining people who spoke the language. In 1858, Castrén published the first grammar and dictionary (), which also included material on the Kott language. During the 19th century, the Ket were mistaken for a tribe of the Finno-Ugric Khanty. A. Karger in 1934 published the first grammar ( ), as well as a Ket primer ( ), and a new treatment appeared in 1968, written by A. Kreinovich.

=== Decline and current use ===
Ket people were subjected to collectivization in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s, according to the recollections of informants, they were sent to Russian-only boarding schools, which led to the ceasing of language transmission between generations. Now, Ket is taught as a subject in some primary schools, but only older adults are fluent and few are raising their children with the language. Kellog, Russia, is the only place where Ket is still taught in schools. Special books are provided for grades second through fourth but after those grades there is only Russian literature to read that describes Ket culture. There are no known monolingual speakers as of 2006. A children&#x27;s book, &quot;A Bit Lost&quot; by Chris Haughton, was translated into the language in 2013. Alexander Kotusov was a Ket folk singer and poet who died in 2019.

Only three localities, Kellog, Surgutikha and Maduika, retain a native Ket-speaking population in the present day. Other villages such as Serkovo and Pakulikha were destroyed in the second half of the 20th century, dispersing the local Ket population to nearby towns.

== Dialects ==
Ket has three dialects: Southern, Central and Northern. All the dialects are very similar to each other and Kets from different groups are able to understand each other. The most common southern dialect was used for the standardized written Ket.

The three remaining Ket-majority localities natively speak different dialects. Southern Ket is spoken in Kellog, Central Ket in Surgutikha and Northern Ket in Maduika.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===

Georg classifies , , and as marginal phonemes.

=== Consonants ===
Vajda analyses Ket as having only 12 consonant phonemes:
It is one of the few languages to lack both and , along with Arapaho, Goliath, Obokuitai, Palauan, and Efik, as well as classical Arabic and some modern Arabic dialects.

There is much allophony, and the phonetic inventory of consonants is essentially as below. This is the level of description reflected by the Ket alphabet.

Furthermore, all nasal consonants in Ket have voiceless allophones at the end of a monosyllabic word with a glottalized or descending tone (i.e. turn into ), likewise, becomes in the same situation. Alveolars are often pronounced laminal and possibly palatalized, though not in the vicinity of a uvular consonant. is normally pronounced with affrication, as .

=== Tone ===
Descriptions of Ket vary widely in the number of contrastive tones they report: as many as eight and as few as zero have been counted. Given this wide disagreement, whether or not Ket is a tonal language is debatable, although recent works by Ket specialists Edward Vajda and Stefan Georg defend the existence of tone.

In tonal descriptions, Ket does not employ a tone on every syllable but instead uses one tone per word. Following Vajda&#x27;s description of Southern Ket, the five basic tones are as follows:

The glottalized tone features pharyngeal or laryngeal constriction, or a full glottal stop that interrupts the vowel.

Georg&#x27;s 2007 description of Ket tone is similar to the above, but reduces the basic number of tonemes to four, while moving the rising high-falling tone plus a variant to a class of tonemes only found in multisyllabic words. With some exceptions caused by certain prefixes or clitics, the domain of tones in a multisyllabic word is limited to the first two syllables.

== Orthography ==

In the 1930s a Latin-based alphabet was developed and used:
In the 1980s a new, Cyrillic-based, alphabet was created:

== Morphology ==
Nouns have nominative basic case (subjects and direct objects) and a system of secondary cases for spatial relations. The three noun classes are: masculine, feminine and inanimate. 

Unlike neighbouring languages of Siberia, Ket makes use of verbal prefixes. Ket has two verbal declensions, one prefixed with &quot;d-&quot; and one with &quot;b-&quot;. The second-person singular prefixes on intransitive verbs are . 

Ket makes significant use of incorporation. Incorporation is not limited to nouns, and can also include verbs, adverbs, adjectives, and bound morphemes found only in the role of incorporated elements. Incorporation also occurs as both a lexicalized process – the combination of verb and incorporate being treated as a distinct lexical element, with a meaning often based around the incorporated element – and a paradigmatic one, where the incorporation is performed spontaneously for particular semantic and pragmatic effect Forms of incorporation include:
*Nominal incorporation, most commonly used to describe the instrumental part of an action, but sometimes used to describe patients instead. Instrumental incorporation does not affect the transitivity of the verb (though there are examples where this form of incorporation is used to describe agentless changes of state), while patient incorporation can make a transitive verb intransitive. Patient incorporation is usually used for patients that are wholly effected by an action (such as being brought into existence by it); more generally affected patients are typically incorporated only when significantly defocused or backgrounded.
*Verbal incorporation, more specifically the incorporation of verbal infinitives (rather than roots) into the verb complex. This form of incorporation is used to signify aspect and form causatives. Incorporated infinitives may bring incorporated elements of their own into the verb as well.
*Adjectival incorporation, with an incorporated adjective describing the target or final state of an action.
*Adverbial incorporation, where a local adverb is used to describe the direction or path of a movement.Ket is classified as a synthetic language. Verbs use prefixes, while suffixes are rare. Nevertheless, incorporation is well-developed.
The division between morphemes is based on fusion. Sandhi are common as well.
The basic word order is subject-object-verb SOV.
The name marking is of Ezāfe-type, the same as in predication.

=== Number ===
Ket has two grammatical numbers, the singular and plural. This is usually expressed by the presence or absence of (individuated plural) or (collective plural), the plural suffixes. The old singulative suffix is present on certain singular forms, however, like the stem &#x27;stone&#x27; &gt; &#x27;stones&#x27;. Some shape-classifying suffixes have developed and are mildly productive.

=== Noun declension ===

== Lexicon ==

=== Loanwords ===
Ket has many loanwords from Russian, such as &#x27;sea&#x27;; there are also loanwords from other languages such as Selkup, for example: the word &#x27;ox&#x27; comes from the Selkup word . Ket also has some Mongolian words, such as &#x27;tea&#x27; from Mongolian . There are also words from Evenki, for example: the word &#x27;tobacco&#x27; is probably borrowed from Evenki &#x27;tobacco&#x27;.

== Sample text ==
=== Examples of sentences ===
* &#x27;He lies/sleeps&#x27;;
* &#x27;We are walking already&#x27;;
* &#x27;He attracted us&#x27;.

<text>Seoul National University (SNU; ) is a public research university located in Seoul, South Korea. It is one of the SKY universities and a part of the Flagship Korean National Universities.

The university&#x27;s main campus is located in Gwanak, and two additional campuses are located in Daehangno and Pyeongchang. The university comprises sixteen colleges, one graduate school and nine professional schools. The student body consists of nearly 17,000 undergraduate and 11,000 graduate students.

==History==
===Pre-establishment===
Seoul National University (SNU) originates from various educational institutions established by King Gojong of the Joseon dynasty. Several of them were integrated into various colleges when SNU was founded later.

To modernize the country, Gojong initiated the establishment of modern higher education institutions. By means of the issue of a royal order, the law academy &quot;&quot; has been founded on March 25, 1895. It produced 209 graduates including the later envoy Yi Tjoune. &quot;Hanseong Sabeomhakgyo&quot; (established in 1895), a training school for teachers and &quot;Euihakkyo&quot; (1899), a medical school, are also considered the origins of respective colleges.

After the proclamation of the Korean Empire in 1897, Gojong, the then emperor, was motivated to create more modern education institutions. In 1899, a medical school was established. This school changed its name several times to &quot;Daehan Euiwon Gyoyukbu&quot; and &quot;Gyeongseong Euihak Jeonmunhakgyo&quot; (Gyeongseong Medical College) and finally became College of Medicine of SNU. In 1901, a department for nursing was established, which was the forerunner of the later College of Nursing.

During the Japanese rule, Keijō Imperial University was established as one of Japan&#x27;s nine imperial universities. After World War II and the independence of Korea, the name of the university was changed from &quot;Keijō Teikoku Daigaku&quot; (京城帝国大学) to &quot;Gyeongseong Daehak&quot; (경성대학, 京城大學, Gyeongseong University). The Hanja that were used in the name were pronounced in the Korean reading and the attribute &quot;Imperial&quot; was removed and changed to &quot;National&quot;.

===Establishment===
SNU was founded on August 27, 1946, by merging ten institutions of higher education around the Seoul area. The schools which have been merged were:
* Gyeongseong (Seoul) University (&quot;Gyeongseong (Seoul) Daehak&quot;, 경성(서울)대학)
* Gyeongseong College of Education (&quot;Gyeongseong Sabeomhakgyo&quot;, 경성사범학교)
* Gyeongseong Women&#x27;s College of Education (&quot;Gyeongseong Yeoja Sabeomhakgyo&quot;, 경성여자사범학교)
* Gyeongseong Law College (&quot;Gyeongseong Beophak Jeonmunhakgyo&quot;, 경성법학전문학교)
* Gyeongseong Industrial College (&quot;Gyeongseong Gongeop Jeonmunhakgyo&quot;, 경성공업전문학교)
* Gyeongseong Mining College (&quot;Gyeongseong Gwangsan Jeonmunhakgyo&quot;, 경성광산전문학교)
* Gyeongseong Medical College (&quot;Gyeongseong Euihak Jeonmunhakgyo&quot;, 경성의학전문학교)
* Suwon Agriculture College (&quot;Suwon Nongnim Jeonmunhakgyo&quot;, 수원농림전문학교)
* Gyeongseong College of Economics (&quot;Gyeongseong Gyeongje Jeonmunhakgyo&quot;, 경성경제전문학교)
* Gyeongseong Dentistry College (&quot;Gyeongseong Chigwa Euihak Jeonmunhakgyo&quot;, 경성치과의학전문학교)

The first president was Harry Bidwell Ansted. For over a year and a half, there was a protest movement by students and professors against the law of the U.S. military government in Korea merging colleges. Finally, 320 professors were fired and more than 4,950 students left the school. The university&#x27;s second president was Lee Choon-ho (), who served beginning in October 1947.

The College of Law was founded by merging the law department of Kyŏngsŏng University (Keijō Imperial University) with Kyŏngsŏng Law College. The university absorbed Seoul College of Pharmacy in September 1950, as the college of Pharmacy. This had previously been a private institution.

In 1950, during the Korean War, the university was occupied by North Korea. During which, the Seoul National University Hospital massacre occurred. The university then temporarily moved to Busan and merged with other universities in South Korea.

===Relocation===
Originally, the main campus (which embraced the College of Humanities and Sciences and College of Law) was in Dongsung-dong, Jongno District. After the construction of a new main campus in Gwanak District in February 1975, most colleges of the university relocated to the new Gwanak Campus between 1975 and 1979 by the request of president Park Chung Hee who disliked student protests at the site where the (founded in the early 1960s and relocated in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi) was formerly located. Part of the former main campus in Jongno District is still used by the College of Medicine, the College of Dentistry and the College of Nursing and is now called Yeongeon Campus.

In 2012, lawmakers reported that the ruling Saenuri Party, prior to the presidential election in December, seriously proposed a plan to relocate the university to the newly established special autonomous Sejong City. The move came as part of an overall effort to decentralize the capital&#x27;s governmental apparatus. Originally the national government had approached the university in 2009 to host the building of a satellite campus. It was reported the following year that the university had considered withdrawing from the Sejong plan.

==Academics==
===Admissions===
Admissions to SNU are extremely competitive. From 1981 to 1987, when an applicant could apply only to one university at a time, more than 80% of the top 0.5% scorers in the annual government-administered scholastic achievement test applied to SNU and many of them were unsuccessful.

===Academic structure===
Sixteen colleges of the university offer 83 undergraduate degree programs. For master and doctoral programs there is one graduate school with 99 programs from five fields of studies. The interdisciplinary programs are the ones invented and operated by more than two departments. In addition to that, there are twelve professional graduate schools.

==Campus==
Seoul National University occupies two Seoul-based, one Pyeongchang-based campuses: the Gwanak Campus is situated in 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak District; and the Yongon Campus is north of the Han River in Daehangno, Jongno District; and the new Pyeongchang campus in Pyeongchang County, Gangwon Province.

===Location===
Gwanak Campus, the main campus, is located in the southern part of Seoul. It is served by its own subway station on Line 2. Yeongeon Campus, the medical campus, is on Daehangno (University Street), northeast Seoul. The defunct Suwon Campus, the agricultural campus, also known as the Sangnok Campus (Evergreen Campus), used to be located in Suwon, about 40 km south of Seoul. The agricultural campus moved to Gwanak in Autumn 2004, but some research facilities still remain in Suwon.

===Future Campus plans===
In February 2010 Seoul National initiated a memorandum with the city of Siheung to establish a global campus. Signed with the city&#x27;s mayor and governor of Gyeonggi Province for administrative assistance, the university acquired of property in the west-coast economic zone, near the Songdo International Business District, Pyeongtaek harbor, international airport, seaport.

The land acquisition will increase the university&#x27;s size by 58% over its current 1.4 million square meters (350 acres) to 2.2 million square meters (550 acres) and headcount by an expected 10,000 people or 33% of its current figure. Along with lecture halls and additional liberal arts and graduate courses, the initiative will add a medical complex including a research hospital and training centre, research centre for dentistry and clinical pharmacology, dormitories, apartments, an international middle and high school, and other facilities. Planning to open the international campus in 2014, the university intends to share the initiative with other regional national institutions.

==Facilities==

===Library===

The Seoul National University Library is located behind the university administrative building in the 62nd block of the Gwanak Campus. The chief librarian, Dr. Kim Jong-seo, professor of religious studies in the College of Humanities, took office in 2009. Following the completion of Kwanjeong Library in February 2015, the SNU Library reached a size of 57,747 square meters. As of 2022, the library is home to 5.2 million volumes of books as well as over 260,000 academic journals and e-journals, and over 230,000 non-book materials.

The Central Library has constructed a digital library, which in addition to the regular library collection provides access to university publications, ancient texts, and theses. Included here are images of pamphlets, lecture slides, and insects. The digital library offers access to video of university exhibitions, scientific events, symposia, and seminars.

The library was opened in 1946 as the &quot;Seoul National University Central Library&quot; and inherited its facilities and books from Keijō Imperial University. In 1949, the name of the library was changed to the &quot;Seoul National University Library Annex&quot;. When the main branch of the library was relocated to the Gwanak Campus in January 1975, it was renamed the &quot;Seoul National University Library&quot;, and then renamed again in 1992 as the &quot;Seoul National University Central Library&quot;.

In 1966, provisions were made to systematize the library&#x27;s collections. The original library was organized into 12 annexes for each of the university&#x27;s colleges: engineering, education, physics, art, law, theology, pharmacology, music, medicine, dentistry, administration, and agricultural sciences. Two years later, in 1968, libraries for newspapers and the liberal arts were added to bring the number of annexes to 14. However, as the main branch was moved to the Gwanak Campus, the education, physics, legal, theological, administrative, newspaper, liberal arts, and pharmacological libraries were combined in a single building.

===Kyujanggak===

The Kyujanggak, also spelled &quot;Gyujanggak&quot;, was the royal library during the Joseon period. It was founded in 1776 by order of King Jeongjo of Joseon, at which time it was located on the grounds of Changdeokgung. Today known as Kyujanggak Royal Library or Kyujanggak Archives are maintained by Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies () at SNU. It functions as a key repository of Korean historical records and a centre for research and publication of the annual journal &quot;Kyujanggak&quot;.

===Museum===
Seoul National University Museum is located at the Gwanak Campus. It opened alongside the university in 1946 under the name &quot;The Seoul National University Museum Annex.&quot; The original two-story Dongsung-dong building, which was erected in 1941, had served as the Keijō Imperial University Museum until it was transferred intact to SNU. When the museum was moved to the sixth floor of the Central Library, in 1975, it was renamed the &quot;Seoul National University Museum&quot;. The museum was then moved to newly constructed facilities, next to the Dongwon Building, in 1993, which it has occupied to this day. Dr. Park Nak-gyu is its director.

===Museum of Art===
The Seoul National University Museum of Art (SNUMoA) was established in 1995 with contributions from the Samsung Cultural Foundation after a proposal from Dr. Lee Jong-sang, a professor of Oriental Art. The building was designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, with construction entrusted to the Samsung Group. The structure lies three stories above and below ground, with its major distinguishing feature, the forward area, cantilevering off the ground. Construction lasted from 2003 to 2005, and the museum opened on June 8, 2006. Dr. Jung Hung-min assumed directorship of the gallery in 2006.

=== Gymnasium ===

The Seoul National University Gymnasium is an indoor sporting arena. The capacity of the arena is 5,000 and was built in 1986 to host table tennis and badminton (demonstration) events at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

===Dormitory===

The dormitory of SNU is named Gwanaksa (). Dormitories for undergraduate and graduate students as well as families are located here. It was founded August 1975, with five Gwanaksa buildings and one welfare building, which housed 970 male students. The female dormitory was founded in February 1983. By June 2007, there were one administration building, two welfare buildings, 12 undergraduate dormitory buildings, six graduate students&#x27; dormitory buildings, which in total housed 3,680 students. Unlike other university dormitories in South Korea, there is no curfew hour.
The dormitory Yeongeonsa is located on the Yeongeon campus, which is the medical school of SNU. Yeongeonsa can house 533 undergraduate students and 17 family households.

===&quot;University Newspaper&quot;===

&quot;The University Newspaper&quot; () is school&#x27;s student newspaper. The first edition of the paper was launched during the Korean War, on February 4, 1952. In 1953 it was moved to Dongsung-dong in Seoul, where from 1958 even editions for high school were published. Financial difficulties in 1960 led the paper to cease printing for a time. It was relocated to the Gwanak Campus in 1975, where it has been in continuous publication until the present day. At the time of its first launch the paper was sold for 500 won a copy, sometimes twice a week. Now, however, it is distributed for free every Monday. The school paper is not available during schools breaks or exams.

==Reputation and rankings==

===Reputation===
SNU graduates dominate South Korea&#x27;s academics, government, politics and business. A KEDI study found that the university&#x27;s name-value translates into wages that are on average about 12 percent higher than that of any other Korean university. Approximately one in four Korean university presidents obtained their undergraduate degree at SNU. Between 2003 and 2009, more students who graduated from science high schools and received presidential scholarships matriculated at SNU than at eight other leading universities combined.

The chiefs of the government-run College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) are mostly SNU graduates.

===International rankings===

In 2015, Thomson-Reuters ranked SNU as the 31st most innovative institution in the world. QS World University Rankings (2023) ranked SNU as the 29th best university in the world and 7th in Asia, whilst it is 7th in the independent regional QS Asian University Rankings (2023). SNU is 11th in Asia and 56th in the world according to the 2023 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. In 2023, its World Reputation Rankings were considered it to be 44th globally. Moreover, ARWU (2022) regarded SNU to be among 98th worldwide and the best in the country. CWUR 2020–2021 ranks SNU as 31st best in the world.

QS University Subject Rankings (2018): 25th, Arts and Humanities; 16th, Engineering and Technology; 37th, Life Sciences and Medicine; 21st, Social Sciences and Management; 20th, Natural Sciences.

The institute was ranked 20th in publications by a 2008 analysis of data from the Science Citation Index, and the following year ranked 8th in the world in clinical trials. In 2011, the Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking World Universities reported that SNU is ranked 10th in the world in terms of the number of alumni holding CEO positions in Fortune 500 enterprises. SNU also had the third highest number of students who went on to earn Ph.Ds in American institutions in 2006.

=== International partners ===
SNU students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as the Singapore Management University, National Taiwan University, Sciences Po, Sorbonne University, University College London, and the University of Warwick.

==Controversies==

There are issues concerning diversity and racial discrimination against foreign professors at SNU. There was an effort to recruit foreign professors for several years from 2009 onwards, with numbers peaking at 242 or 4% of the total. This number has declined, with a large proportion of the newer &quot;foreign&quot; recruits actually being former South Korean citizens who became naturalized as foreign citizens abroad. Many of the earlier batch of foreign professors left after complaining of racial discrimination against them, sometimes without even giving notice. SNU failed to boost its international reputation by offering contracts to Nobel Prize laureates, but they are mostly retired and holding other academic posts elsewhere, are rarely on campus and sometimes leave before their contracts run out.

== Notable alumni and faculty ==


Among its notable alumni are prominent figures in international organizations and businesses such as Ban Ki-moon, the eighth secretary-general of the United Nations (UN); Hoesung Lee, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); Song Sang-hyun, former president of the International Criminal Court (ICC); Lee Jong-wook, the sixth director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), O-Gon Kwon, former vice president and permanent judge in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY); Kwon Oh-hyun, former CEO and vice chairman of Samsung Electronics; and Bang Si-hyuk, the chairman and founder of HYBE Corporation.

<doc id="196031" wikidata="Q1471452" url="?curid=196031" title="Palm mute">
<text>The palm mute is a technique for guitar and bass guitar known for its muted sound. It is performed by placing the side of the picking hand across the guitar&#x27;s strings, close to the bridge, while picking. The name is a misnomer as the muting is not performed using the player&#x27;s palm.

Palm muting is a standard technique used by both classical and electric guitarists. It is widely used in heavy metal and rock music but it is often found in any style of music that features electric guitars with distortion. It is responsible for the characteristic &quot;chugging&quot; and &quot;crunch&quot; sound of distorted guitar music. Palm muting can also be used in conjunction with a wah pedal to produce the distinctive scratching sound often heard in disco music.

Palm muting is also used by electric bassists in order to obtain a warm, &quot;thumpy&quot; tone which is sometimes similar to that of a finger-picked double bass (as noted above). The strings may be plucked with the thumb or with a pick, which gives a more percussive tone.

== Aspects of performance ==

There are many ways to perform palm muting, but, generally the following are recognized:

* Applied pressure. Amount of applied pressure tends to vary the sound a lot. Slight touch makes light muting, thus producing more pronounced, fuller sounds. Pressing the hand down intensively makes heavy muting, enhancing staccato effect, adding percussion and making notes less recognizable. Certainly, with some amplification gain, heavily muted notes sound quieter than lightly muted, but given a fair amount of compression, loudness levels become the same and heavily muted notes sound less muddy, with fewer overtones and tonal characteristics than lightly muted.
* Hand position. The most common way to play with palm muting is placing the edge of picking hand near the bridge, dampening the strings when necessary. However, moving the hand further from the bridge and closer to the neck changes the effect drastically. Moving the hand closer to the bridge (and even resting part of edge on the bridge) makes palm muting lighter. Moving the hand further from bridge (going up to the neck) makes palm muting heavier. Note that resting the palm on the bridge is usually considered a bad practice among guitarists (other than for performing palm muting) for the following reasons:
** Ergonomic: it is generally not very ergonomic to play this way; maintaining the picking hand edge always strictly parallel to the bridge rivets the motions and encumbers performance of most advanced techniques;
** Metal part corrosion: while playing intensively, hands usually become sweaty; sweat coming in contact with metal bridge hastens its corrosion; metal strings corrode too, but strings are considered a consumable, while the bridge is more expensive.
** Tremolo interference: when using a floating tremolo bridge, such as the Floyd Rose, applying pressure to the bridge may affect the pitch of played strings.
* Amount of amplification (gain).
* Muted notes / chords. Generally, it is recognized that full chords (with 3&#x27;) sound muddy with large amounts of amplification and distortion, unlike single notes and power chords. Sustain sound coming from each string simultaneously makes large amounts of overlapping overtones after distortion and thus a chord loses its clarity. Palm muting of such chords helps to alleviate this problem, giving notes chuggier, more distortion-friendly sound.

Palm muting is a basis for many other techniques, especially those specific to electric guitars, such as sweep picking or alternate picking.

== Notation ==
In guitar tablature, palm mutes are rendered with a &quot;P.M.&quot; or &quot;PM&quot;, and a dashed or dotted line for the duration of the phrase to be muted. If the pitches of the muted notes are discernible, the fret numbers are given accordingly, otherwise they are represented with an X in lieu of a tab number. (If an X appears in lieu of a tab number but there is no P.M. directive, this means to mute the string using the fretting hand, not the picking hand.)

 e |------------------|
 B |--8-------8-------|
 G |--7-------7-------|
 D |--6-------6-------|
 A |--7-------7-------|
 E |----0-0-0---0-0-0-|

== Recorded examples ==
One popular song with palm muting is &quot;Basket Case&quot; by Green Day, where power chords are accented then muted to create a sense of energy and urgency.

 D# |---------------7-|-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-x-x-|-------------4-4-|-4-4-4-4-4-4-4-x-x-|

More aggressive styles of palm muting grew out of thrash metal in the mid-late 1980s with bands such as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth. The technique was fused with fast alternate picking, under high gain, to create a driving, percussive effect. Other uses of palm muting can be heard in post-punk bands like Gang of Four and Talking Heads, as well as in contemporary musicians such as Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse. Another example would be &quot;Paranoid&quot; by Black Sabbath, which uses palm muting for much of the song.

<text>Canon Inc. (; Hepburn: ) is a Japanese multinational corporation headquartered in Ōta, Tokyo, specializing in optical, imaging, and industrial products, such as lenses, cameras, medical equipment, scanners, printers, and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Canon has a primary listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the TOPIX Core 30 and Nikkei 225 indexes. It used to have a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

==Name==
The company was originally named (). In 1934, it produced the &quot;Kwanon&quot;, a prototype for Japan&#x27;s first-ever 35 mm camera with a focal-plane-based shutter. In 1947, the company name was changed to &quot;Canon Camera Co., Inc.&quot;, shortened to &quot;Canon Inc.&quot; in 1969. The name Canon comes from Buddhist bodhisattva (), previously transliterated as Kuanyin, Kwannon, or Kwanon in English.

==History==
===1933–1970===
The origins of Canon date back to the founding of Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory in Japan in 1933 by Takeshi Mitarai, , and . It became the company Precision Optical Instruments, Co., Ltd. in 1937. During its early years, the company did not have any facilities to produce its own optical glass, and its first cameras incorporated &quot;Nikkor&quot; lenses from Nippon Kogaku K.K. (the later Nikon Corporation).

Between 1933 and 1936, &#x27;The Kwanon&#x27;, a copy of the Leica design, Japan&#x27;s first 35 mm focal-plane-shutter camera, was developed in prototype form. In 1940 Canon developed Japan&#x27;s first indirect X-ray camera. Canon introduced a field zoom lens for television broadcasting in 1958, and in 1959 introduced the Reflex Zoom 8 and the Canonflex.

In 1961, Canon introduced the Rangefinder camera, Canon 7, and 50mm 1:0.95 lens in a special bayonet mount. In 1964 Canon introduced the &#x27;Canola 130&#x27;, the first Japanese made 10-key calculator, a substantial improvement on the design of the British Bell Punch company, which introduced the first fully electronic calculator two years earlier with the Sumlock Anita Mark 8 unit. In 1965 Canon introduced the Canon Pellix, a single lens reflex (SLR) camera with a semi-transparent stationary mirror which enabled the taking of pictures through the mirror.
=== 1970–2009 ===
In 1971, Canon introduced the Canon F-1, a high-end SLR camera, and the FD lens range. In 1976, Canon launched the Canon AE-1, the world&#x27;s first camera with an embedded micro-computer.

Canon introduced their Inkjet printer using bubble-jet technology in 1985, one year after Hewlett-Packard. In 1987, Canon introduced their Canon Electro-Optical System (EOS), named after the goddess of the dawn, along with the Canon EOS 650 autofocus SLR camera. Also in 1987, the Canon Foundation was established. In 1988, Canon introduced &#x27;Kyosei philosophy&#x27;. The EOS 1 Flagship Professional SLR line was launched in 1989. In the same year the EOS RT, the world&#x27;s first AF SLR with a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror, was unveiled.

In 1992, Canon launched the Canon EOS 5, the first-ever camera with eye-controlled AF, and the PowerShot 600, its first digital camera. In 1995, Canon introduced the first commercially available SLR lens with internal image stabilization, Canon EF 75-300mm lens f/4-5.6 IS USM. The Canon EOS-RS was the world&#x27;s fastest AF SLR camera with a continuous shooting speed of 10 frame/s at the time. Based on the EOS-1N, the EOS-1N RS had a fixed, semi-transparent pellicle mirror with a hard coat. In 1996, Canon introduced a pocket-sized digital camera with the Advanced Photo System, named ELPH in America and IXUS in Europe. Canon entered the digital video camcorder market in 1997.

In 2004, Canon introduced the XEED SX50 LCD projector. Canon introduced its first high-definition camcorder in 2005.

In November 2009, Canon made a €730 million (US$1.1 billion) all-cash offer for the Dutch printer maker Océ. Canon had acquired majority ownership of Océ by March 2010, and completed the acquisition of 100% of shares in Océ by the end of 2011.


=== 2010–2019 ===
In 2010, Canon acquired Tereck Office Solutions, Inc.

On 16 March 2010, Canon announced that it was seeking to acquire a new generic top-level domain, acquiring it in February 2015 and using it for the first time on its global website in May 2016.

In the third quarter of 2012, Canon&#x27;s global market share in the sale of printers, copiers and multifunction devices was 20.90%.

In February 2014, Canon announced it would acquire Texas-based Molecular Imprints Inc., a developer of nanoprint lithography systems, for an amount speculated to be around US$98 million.

On 13 June 2014, Canon announced it had acquired Danish IP Surveillance VMS software company Milestone Systems. Milestone provides open-platform software to allow video management from various vendors in a single interface; therefore the company will operate as a separate entity.

On 10 February 2015, Canon announced that it had intentions to buy Swedish Security Camera maker Axis Communications for US$2.83 billion. On 23 February 2015, Axis Communications reacted to this news and confirmed that it had received a purchase proposal from Canon. The purchase was effectively completed in April 2015.

On 24 April 2015, Canon Europe announced it had acquired the London-based family photo sharing startup Lifecake.

In November 2015, in an effort to avoid the selling of gray-market camera gear, Canon USA filed litigation against a number of camera gear retailers. Retailers include Get It Digital, All New Shop and F&amp;E Trading.

In March 2016, Canon acquired Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation for US$5.9 billion.

On 28 March 2017, Canon Europe announced it had acquired the London-based printing startup Kite.

On 2 April 2019, Canon introduces two new UHDgc 2/3-inch Portable Zoom Lenses designed For 4K UHD Broadcast Cameras.

In July 2020, Canon recorded its first ever quarterly loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In September 2020, Fujitsu announced that it would provide Canon with a Fujitsu Supercomputer PRIMEHPC FX1000 unit, to assist with its no-prototype development manufacturing initiative.

In December 2020, Canon concluded its photographic-equipment print-ad series named &quot;Wildlife as Canon Sees It&quot;. This series of ads began in 1981 in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine.

In October 2023, Canon introduced its new nanoimprint lithography manufacturing systems, which it claims are simpler and more affordable than ASML&#x27;s extreme ultraviolet lithography systems. The system prints the desired circuit pattern onto the silicon wafer bypassing photolithography and can produce circuits equivalent to 5 nm scale.

==Products==

Canon&#x27;s products include cameras (including compact digital camera, video camera, film SLR and digital SLR), camcorders, lenses, broadcasting equipment and solutions (such as free viewpoint solution), professional displays, projectors, manufacturing equipment (including photolithography equipment such as steppers, scanners), printers, photocopiers, image scanners, digital microfilm scanners, fax machines, binoculars, microscopes, medical equipment (including diagnostic systems such as ultrasound, X-ray, CT and MRI scanners and ophthalmic equipment), CCTV solutions, image sensors, calculators, high precision positioning and measurement devices (such as rotary encoders), custom optical components, handy terminals, mixed reality systems, software, and space satellites.

=== Digital cameras ===

Canon has been manufacturing and distributing digital cameras since 1984, starting with the RC-701. The RC series was followed by the PowerShot and Digital IXUS series of digital cameras. Canon also developed the EOS series of digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLR) which includes high-end professional models.

Due to consumers switching from compact cameras to smartphones, Canon&#x27;s Q1 2013 operating profit fell 34 percent year-on-year.

=== Flash units ===

Canon produces a range of high-output flash units for its DSLR cameras, including the 270EX II, 320EX, 430EX II, 430EX III-RT, 470EX-AI, 580EX, 580EX II, 600EX-RT, 600EXII-RT, EL-1, and EL-5 Speedlites. Canon also produces macro flash units, including the Macro Twin Lite and the Macro Ring Lite.

=== Camcorders ===
=== CMOS image sensor ===
Canon designs and manufactures CMOS image sensors in-house for its imaging products and it has three dedicated fabs in Japan. In 2016, Canon, the fifth-largest image sensor manufacturer in the world, decided to start selling the sensors to other companies. However, it does not plan to sell smartphone image sensors to focus on the niche markets such as industrial and space observation.

Although Canon had withdrawn from the so-called &#x27;pixel count race&#x27; in the 2000s, it has been on the cutting edge as to the image sensor resolution in recent years. A demo of a 250MP image sensor was revealed in 2015 and reported to be launched in 2020. In 2018, Canon launched a 120MP image sensor as a part of its latest BtoB offerings.

=== Printers ===
For many years, Canon was the principal maker of the print engines found in industry-standard laser printers. The first models of Apple LaserWriter and the equivalent products made by HP used the Canon LBP-CX engine. The next models (LaserWriter II series, LaserJet II series) used the Canon LBP-SX engine. Later models used the Canon LBP-LX, LBP-EX, LBP-PX engines and many other Canon print engines.

Following Canon&#x27;s acquisition of the Dutch digital printing manufacturer Océ in 2010, Canon continued to develop and manufacture printing systems, initially under the Océ brand name. On 1.1.2020 the company Océ was officially renamed Canon Production Printing.

Canon has been sued over intentionally designing all-in-one printers that cannot scan when the printer is low on ink. Canon settled the lawsuit in 2023 without admitting guilt.

=== Digital copiers ===
Canon&#x27;s largest division in terms of revenue is its multifunction copier division. Canon distributes its consumer and home office imageCLASS line though retail outlets and professional-grade imageRUNNER series through subsidiary Canon Solutions America and independent distributors. The professional-grade series ranges from small table tops to large digital presses.

=== Scanners ===
Canon manufactures a wide range of flatbed scanners, film scanners and document scanners for home and business use, including the Canon CanoScan 8800F. Some of its scanners employ LED inDirect Exposure (LiDE) technology, such that USB port is sufficient to power the scanner, and no additional power is required.

Current printers use the proprietary BJNP protocol (USB over IP port 8611).

=== Calculators ===
Canon produced a range of calculators in various applications, including handheld calculators, desktop calculators, printing calculators and scientific calculators. One model was the 1964 Canola 130. It had 13 digits, a result of marketing research. The reason for the odd number of figures was based on selling it to the Japanese central bank. Given the low value of the Japanese Yen, 13 digits was a requirement of the banks.

The calculator was built by germanium transistors and the display was a light pipe which gave an odd format.

=== Projectors ===
Canon produces a range of projectors.

=== Presenters ===
Canon offers a range of wireless presenters, from advanced green laser presenters with back-lit screen display to basic red laser presentation clickers.

=== Virtual reality headset ===
Canon is developing a prototype virtual reality headset (Canon VR). The headset offers a wider viewing angle (120°) than other VR devices but requires handles rather than a head strap. The headset is not yet available on the market. As of 2020, Canon produces and sells high-end AR (augmented reality) headsets for enterprise users.

===Manufacturing equipment===
Canon is one of the world&#x27;s top producers of semiconductor and display manufacturing equipment. Its subsidiary Canon Tokki dominates the market of material deposition equipment, and instruments for manufacturing OLED displays. Canon is also the leading manufacturer of display photolithography equipment and one of the top 3 in the semiconductor lithography machine market. Once a leader of semiconductor lithography along with Nikon, it has been dwarfed by ASML, and as of 2017 its share in the overall market was less than 5%. Still, Canon maintains a great presence in the i-line stepper market.

== Discontinued products ==
=== Computers ===

Canon introduced two MSX home computer models in 1983, the V-10 and the V-20. Both offered just the minimum range of the MSX standards without any additional features. The V-20 was able to receive shooting data from the T90 Canon camera with the Data Memory Back T90 expansion.

Canon also sold a Canon AS100 PC for which you could get a color or monochrome display computer, shortly after the release of the IBM PC. It was based on the Intel 8088 processor and used CP/M or MS-DOS. Options included an 8 MB hard drive.

== Operations ==
As of 2020, Canon is organized into four principal business segments:
# the Office Business Unit (the products of which include copying machines, digital production printers, large format inkjet printers, laser printers and multi-function devices);
# the Imaging System Business Unit (the products of which include broadcasting equipment, calculators, compact digital cameras, digital SLR cameras, digital video camcorders, image scanners, interchangeable lenses, inkjet multifunction printers and single function inkjet printers);
# the Medical System Business Unit (the products of which include a broad range of medical equipment, such as ophthalmic equipment, CT, ultrasound scanners, and MRI); and,
# the Industry and Others Business Unit (the products of which include computers, handy terminals, magnetic heads, micromotors, flat panel display lithography equipment, semiconductor lithography equipment, and network cameras).
Canon Inc&quot;.&quot; has 383 subsidiaries as of 31 June 2017. The number includes second-generation subsidiaries, for example, Canon IT Solutions Inc.

Canon&#x27;s world headquarters is located at 30-2 Shimomaruko 3-chome, Ota-ku, Tokyo 146–8501, Japan. Canon has regional headquarters in America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Japan, Asia and Oceania (including Australia &amp; New Zealand). Canon Europe has two principal subsidiaries: Canon Europa NV (based in Amstelveen, Netherlands) and Canon Europe Ltd. (based in Uxbridge, UK).

On 26 December 2003, Canon Inc. announced restructuring plans for three domestic Canon Group companies. The restructuring involved the merger of two companies and the spinning off of one.

Canon generated total revenues of US$45,608 million in 2011, of which 53.9% was by the Office Business Unit, 36.9% by the Consumer Business Unit and 11.8% by the Industry and Others Business Unit. In the same year, 31.3% of revenues were generated in Europe, 27.0% in the Americas, 22.2% in Asia and Oceania (excl. Japan) and 19.5% in Japan.

Canon invested a total of US$3,946 million in research and development in 2011, equivalent to 8.7% of sales. In 2011, Canon was granted 2,813 patents in the United States, the third-highest number of any company (after IBM and Samsung Electronics).

==Environmental record==
A report by the environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet puts Canon at the top of a list of 56 companies the survey conducted on climate-friendly companies.

Canon has also launched three new calculators in Europe, called &quot;Green Calculators&quot;, which are produced in part from recycled Canon copiers.

The Canon Group has an environmental charter which looks at &quot;offering products with a lower environmental burden through improvements in resource efficiency, while eliminating anti-social activities that threaten the health and safety of mankind and the environment&quot;. In 2020, Canon joined WIPO GREEN as an official partner in an effort to address climate change.

===Climate scepticism===
Meanwhile, the Canon Institute for Global Studies, a thinktank affiliated with Canon, has published many articles of denying the climate crisis. Canon said in a statement to the Guardian that “the thinktank is not a Canon business, so we are not in a position to answer about its research or activities.”

In response, the Action Speak Louder, a corporate watchdog group, held a contest called &quot;Cameras Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;.

== Charitable activities ==
In 2008, Canon donated financial support to help the estimated 5 million people displaced by the earthquake that hit China&#x27;s Sichuan province in May 2008. RMB 1 million was donated to the Red Cross Society of China shortly after the earthquake. Canon Inc., Japan, soon followed with a donation of RMB 10 million.

== Sponsorships ==
In 1983, Canon came as the first title sponsors of the English football league The Football League, which was named The Canon League from 1983 to 1986, when the sponsorship was taken over by the &quot;Today&quot; newspaper. Canon also sponsored Italian football club Hellas Verona FC between 1982 and 1986 including during the 1984–85 Serie A which they won.

From 1967 to 2003 Canon sponsored the Greater Hartford Open, now Travelers Championship.

In Formula One, Canon sponsored Williams between 1985 and 1993, while they won World Drivers Championships for Nelson Piquet (1987), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Alain Prost (1993) and Four World Constructors Championships (1986, 1987, 1992, 1993). In the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix, Canon sponsored Brawn GP.

Between 1994 and 1997 they also sponsored the South Sydney Rabbitohs.

Since 2006, Canon has been helping the Red Cross provide support to 13 Red Cross National Societies across Europe, with focus on youth projects. Support from Canon includes financial contributions and donations of imaging equipment, including cameras, copying machines and digital radiography devices, as well as volunteer activities.

Canon Europe has been a partner of World Press Photo for 16 years. World Press Photo promotes the professional standards in photography; organises the largest international contest for professional photojournalists; and acts as a worldwide platform for press photography.

Canon Asia sponsored many competitions such as Canon Photomarathon and reality TV show &quot;Photo Face-Off&quot;. The latter is a reality TV show in which professional photographer Justin Mott is the judge and competes against amateur photographers. Justin started filming season 3 in April 2016 and that season aired at the end of that same year.

<text>Ludwig August Theodor Beck (; 29 June 1880 – 20 July 1944) was a German general and Chief of the German General Staff during the early years of the Nazi regime in Germany before World War II. Although Beck never became a member of the Nazi Party, in the early 1930s he supported Adolf Hitler&#x27;s forceful denunciation of the Treaty of Versailles and the need to re-arm, although he believed Germany needed more time to rearm before starting a war.

In serving as Chief of Staff of the German Army between 1935 and 1938, Beck became increasingly disillusioned and stood in opposition to the rising totalitarianism of the Nazi regime and to Hitler&#x27;s aggressive foreign policy. Public foreign-policy disagreements with Hitler made Beck resign as Chief of Staff in August 1938. Beck became a major leader within the conspiracy against Hitler. The 20 July plot failed, however, and Beck shot himself in the head but succeeded only in severely wounding himself. One of General Friedrich Fromm&#x27;s men then shot him in the back of the neck.

==Early life and career==
Beck was born on 29 June 1880 in Biebrich (now a borough of Wiesbaden, Hesse) in Hesse-Nassau, at Biebrich, Hessen in Germany to Bertha (nee Draudt) and industrialist Ludwig Georg Ernst Wilhelm Beck.

He served on the Western Front during the First World War as a staff officer. After the war, he served in various staff and command appointments. In 1931 and 1932, he led the group of army writers, at the Department of the Army (&quot;Truppenamt&quot;), which published the German Army Operations Manual, &quot;Truppenführung&quot;. The first section was promulgated in 1933 and the second section in 1934. A modified version is still in use today by the Bundeswehr. He was promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; in 1932. Two years later, in 1934, he replaced General Wilhelm Adam as chief of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot;, the camouflaged General Staff (the Treaty of Versailles explicitly forbade the existence of the General Staff).

In September and October 1930, Beck was a leading defence witness at the trial in Leipzig of three junior Reichswehr officers: Lieutenant Richard Scheringer, Hans Friedrich Wendt and Hanns Ludin. The three men were charged with being members of the Nazi Party since members of the Reichswehr were forbidden from membership of political parties. The three officers admitted their membership and used as their defence the claim that Nazi Party membership should not be forbidden to Reichswehr personnel. When the three officers were arrested after being caught red-handed distributing Nazi literature at their base, Beck, the commanding officer of the 5th Artillery Regiment based in Ulm, to which the three Nazi officers belonged, was furious and argued that since the Nazi Party was a force for good, Reichswehr personnel should not be banned from joining the party. At the preliminary hearing, Beck spoke on behalf of the three officers. 

At the Leipzig trial of Ludin and Scheringer, Beck testified to the good character of the accused, described the Nazi Party as a positive force in German life and proclaimed his belief that the Reichswehr ban on Nazi Party membership should be rescinded. When Lieutenant Scheringer spoke of a future war in which the Nazi Party and the Reichswehr would fight hand in hand as brothers in a &quot;war of liberation&quot; to abrogate the Treaty of Versailles, Beck supported Scheringer by testifying, &quot;The Reichswehr is told daily that it is an army of leaders. What is a young officer to understand by that?&quot; 

Historians such as Sir John Wheeler-Bennett have noted that Beck was deliberately distorting the principle of Hans von Seeckt&#x27;s &quot;Führerarmee&quot; (&quot;Army of Leaders&quot;), which trained soldiers to be leaders for when the army would be expanded beyond the limits permitted by the Treaty of Versailles, by seeking to apply it to politics.

==Early career in Nazi Germany==
In 1933, on witnessing the Nazi &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;, Beck wrote, &quot;I have wished for years for the political revolution, and now my wishes have come true. It is the first ray of hope since 1918&quot;. In July 1934, Beck expressed some alarm at Nazi foreign policy involving Germany in a &quot;premature war&quot; after the failed Nazi putsch in Austria, which led Beck to warn that those in &quot;leading positions&quot; must understand that foreign adventures might then lead to Germany being forced to make a &quot;humiliating retreat&quot;, which might bring about the end of the regime. In August 1934, after the death of President Paul von Hindenburg, which led to Hitler&#x27;s assumption of the roles of powers of the presidency, most notably the position of commander-in-chief, Beck wrote that Hitler&#x27;s move created &quot;favourable conditions&quot; for the Reichswehr.

Beck gained respect with the publication of his tactical manual, &quot;Truppenführung&quot;. Both Beck and General Werner von Fritsch commanded the 1st Cavalry Division, in Frankfurt an der Oder prior to assuming their command positions. During his time first as Chief of the &quot;Truppenamt&quot; (1933–1935) and then as Chief of the General Staff (1935–1938), Beck encouraged the development of armoured forces but not to the extent that advocates of &quot;Panzer&quot; warfare, such as Heinz Guderian, wanted. In Beck&#x27;s conception of power politics, it was crucial to have German military power restored to its pre-1919 levels, and from the latter half of 1933, he advocated a level of military spending beyond even those considered by Hitler. Once Germany was sufficiently rearmed, Beck thought that the Reich should wage a series of wars that would establish Germany as Europe&#x27;s foremost power and place all of Central and Eastern Europe into the German sphere of influence.
As Chief of the General Staff, Beck lived in a modest home in the Lichterfelde suburb of Berlin, and worked normally from 09:00 to 19:00 every day. In that role, Beck was widely respected for his intelligence and work ethic but was often criticised by other officers for being too interested in administrative details. In 1934, Beck wrote a lengthy covering letter to a long report on the British Army armour manoeuvres as a way of encouraging interest in armoured warfare. In Beck&#x27;s view of the General Staff&#x27;s role, the War Minister served in a mere administrative function, and the Chief of the General Staff should have been able to advise the Reich leadership directly. His views led to conflicts with War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, who resented Beck&#x27;s efforts to diminish his powers.

In 1936, Beck strongly supported Hitler during the remilitarisation of the Rhineland against Blomberg, who feared the French reaction to such a move. By late 1937 and early 1938, Beck had come into increasing conflict with other officers over the place and importance of the General Staff in the German military hierarchy, in which Beck wished to have all of the important decisionmaking moved into the arms of the General Staff.

In the mid-1930s, Beck started to create his own intelligence network of German military attachés, whom he used both to collect and to leak information. Besides military attachés, Beck also recruited civilians for his private intelligence network, the most notable volunteer being Carl Goerdeler.

In May 1937, Beck refused an order to draw up orders for executing &quot;Fall Otto&quot; (Case Otto), the German plan for an invasion of Austria, under the grounds that such a move might cause a world war before Germany was ready. During the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of February–March 1938, once Beck was convinced that no war would result from a move against Austria, he swiftly drew up the orders. In Beck&#x27;s conception of power politics, war was a necessary part of restoring Germany to a great power if the wars were limited and if Germany possessed enough strength and had allies that were sufficiently strong.

During the Blomberg-Fritsch Crisis in early 1938, Beck saw a chance to reassert the interests and power of the army against what he regarded as the excessive power of the SS.

==Pre-war conflict with Hitler==
Beck resented Adolf Hitler for his efforts to curb the army&#x27;s position of influence. Beck tried very early—as Chief of the General Staff—to deter Hitler from using the grievances of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, most of whose population was ethnically German, as an excuse for war in 1938.

Beck had no moral objection to the idea of a war of aggression to eliminate Czechoslovakia as a state. In 1935, he had a series of meetings with Prince Bernard von Bülow, the State Secretary of the German Foreign Office and the Chief of the Hungarian General Staff to discuss plans &quot;for the division of Czechoslovakia&quot;. On 12 November 1937, Beck submitted a memorandum stating that &quot;various facts&quot; show the requirement &quot;for an imminent solution by force&quot; of the problem of Czechoslovakia and that it was desirable to start preparing &quot;the political ground among those powers which stood on our side or who were not against us&quot; and that the &quot;military discussion in either the one case or the other should begin at once&quot;.

However, Beck felt that Germany needed more time to rearm before starting such a war. In Beck&#x27;s assessment, the earliest date Germany could risk a war was 1940, and any war that was started in 1938 would be a &quot;premature war&quot; that Germany would lose. Most of the generals felt that the idea of starting a war in 1938 was highly risky, but none of them would confront Hitler with a refusal to carry out orders since most of them thought that Beck&#x27;s arguments against war in 1938 were flawed. From May 1938, Beck had bombarded Hitler, Wilhelm Keitel and Walther von Brauchitsch with memoranda opposing &quot;Fall Grün&quot; (Case Green), the plan for a war against Czechoslovakia. In the first memorand, on 5 May 1938, Beck argued that the Sino-Japanese War meant Japan would be unable to come to Germany&#x27;s aid, that the French Army was the best fighting force in Europe and that Britain would certainly intervene on the side of France if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia.

In his May memorandum, Beck argued that Hitler&#x27;s assumptions about France, which were made in the Hossbach Memorandum of 1937, were mistaken and stated his belief that France &quot;wishes for peace or, perhaps more accurately, abhors a new war&quot; but that &quot;in case of a real threat, or what is perceived by the people to be foreign policy pressure, the French nation comes together as if one&quot;. Beck believed &quot;The French army is and remains intact and is at the moment the strongest in Europe&quot;. Beck ended with these comments: &quot;The military-economic situation of Germany is bad, worse than in 1917–1918. In its current military, military-political and military-economic condition, Germany cannot expose itself to the risk of a long war&quot;. The May Crisis of 21–22 May 1938 further convinced Beck of the dangers of going to war in 1938 and led him to increase his efforts to stop a war that he felt that Germany could not win. In November 1938, Beck informed a friend that from the time of the May Crisis, he had only one consideration in his mind: &quot;How can I prevent a war?&quot;

On 22 May 1938, Hitler stated that he had deep respect for Beck for his pro-Nazi testimony at the Ulm trial of 1930, but his views were too much that of a Reichswehr general and not enough of a Wehrmacht general. Hitler commented that Beck was &quot;one of the officers still imprisoned in the idea of the hundred-thousand-man army&quot;. On 28 May 1938, Beck had a meeting with Hitler, Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, Admiral Erich Raeder, Hermann Göring, Wilhelm Keitel, and Walther von Brauchitsch, during which Hitler restated the views that he had first expressed in the Hossbach Memorandum. In response, Beck drafted another memo on 29 May in which he presented a case that the Czechoslovak Army was not, as Hitler argued, a weak force and that a limited regional war in Central Europe was not a realistic possibility. In the same memorandum, Beck proclaimed his agreement with Hitler&#x27;s views about the necessity of acquiring &quot;Lebensraum&quot; in Eastern Europe, called the existence of Czechoslovakia &quot;intolerable&quot; and concluded that &quot;a way must be found to eliminate it (Czechoslovakia) as a threat to Germany, even, if necessary, by war&quot;. However, Beck argued that Germany was not strong enough to fight the general war that would result from an attack on Czechoslovakia in 1938 and urged Hitler to avoid a &quot;premature war&quot;. In particular, Beck argued, &quot;It is not accurate to judge Germany today as stronger than in 1914&quot;. He also presented a detailed military case that more time was needed before the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; would be as strong as the army of 1914. Furthermore, Beck contended that he could not &quot;accept these estimates of the military power of France and England... Germany, whether alone or in alliance with Italy, is not in a position militarily to match England or France&quot;.

At first, Beck felt that Hitler&#x27;s rush to war in 1938 was caused not by his personality but rather him receiving poor military advice, especially from Keitel. As a result, Beck spent much of his time urging a reorganization of the command structure so that Hitler would receive his advice from the General Staff and presumably abandon his plans for aggression. In a memorandum opposing war in 1938, Beck commented: &quot;Once again, the comments of the Führer demonstrate the complete inadequacy of the current top military-advisory hierarchy&quot;. Beck advocated the need for a &quot;continual, competent advising of the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht on questions of war leadership&quot; and predicted that otherwise, &quot;the future destiny of the Wehrmacht in peace and war, indeed the destiny of Germany in a future war, must be painted in the blackest of colors&quot;.

It was only in June 1938 that Beck realised that Hitler was behind the drive for war. In a memorandum to Brauchitsch, Beck urged that all of the senior officers threaten a mass collective resignation to force Hitler to abandon his plans for &quot;Fall Grün&quot; in 1938. Beck ended his appeal to Brauchitsch: &quot;If they all act together, then it will be impossible to carry out military action... If a soldier in a position of highest authority in such times see his duties and tasks only within the limits of his military responsibilities, without consciousness of his higher responsibility to the whole people, then he shows a lack of greatness, a lack of comprehension of responsibility. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary actions!&quot;

Beck&#x27;s campaign for a mass resignation was not aimed at the overthrow of Hitler but was rather intended to persuade Hitler to abandon his plans for war in 1938 and to purge certain &quot;radical&quot; elements from the Nazi Party, which Beck believed to have a negative influence on Hitler. Together with the &quot;Abwehr&quot; chief, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, and the German Foreign Office&#x27;s State Secretary, Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker, Beck was a leader of the &quot;antiwar&quot; group in the German government, which was determined to avoid a war in 1938 that it felt Germany would lose. The group was not necessarily committed to the overthrow of the regime but was loosely allied to another, more radical group, the &quot;anti-Nazi&quot; faction centred on Colonel Hans Oster and Hans Bernd Gisevius, which wanted to use the crisis as an excuse for executing a &quot;putsch&quot; to overthrow the Nazi regime. The divergent aims between both factions produced considerable tensions.

In a June 1938 General Staff study, Beck concluded that Germany could defeat Czechoslovakia but that to do so would leave western Germany empty of troops, which could allow the French to seize the Rhineland with little difficulty. Beck maintained that Czechoslovak defences were very formidable, Prague could mobilise at least 38 divisions and at least 30 German divisions would be needed to break through, which required a campaign of at least three weeks. Beck concluded that Hitler&#x27;s assumptions about a limited war in 1938 were mistaken. In July 1938, upon being shown Beck&#x27;s 5 May 1938 memorandum opposing &quot;Fall Grün&quot; by Brauchitsch, Hitler called Beck&#x27;s arguments &quot;kindische Kräfteberechnungen&quot; (&quot;childish calculations&quot;). In another memorandum of July 1938, Beck contended that a war against Czechoslovakia, France and Britain would end in Germany&#x27;s defeat and urged Hitler to postpone his plans for aggression until Germany was strong enough for such a war. In late July 1938, Erich von Manstein, a leading protégé of Beck&#x27;s, wrote to his mentor urging him to stay at his post and to place his faith in Hitler. On 29 July, Beck wrote a memorandum stating the German Army had the duty to prepare for possible wars with foreign enemies and &quot;for an internal conflict which need only take place in Berlin&quot;. The 29 July memo is normally considered to be the start of Beck&#x27;s efforts to overthrow the Nazi regime.

In August 1938, Beck suggested to Brauchitsch that a &quot;house cleaning&quot; of the Nazi regime was necessary, under which the influence of the SS would be reduced, but Hitler would continue as dictator. At a 10 August summit, attended by the leading generals of the &quot;Reich&quot;, Hitler spent much of the time attacking Beck&#x27;s arguments against &quot;Fall Grün&quot; and won over the majority of the generals. Beck resigned alone on 18 August. He was replaced, as head of the General Staff, by General Franz Halder. At Hitler&#x27;s request, Beck kept his resignation secret and thus nullified the protest value of his resignation. Hitler promised Beck that if he kept his resignation secret, he would be rewarded with a major field command, and Beck was much disillusioned after he was instead put on the retired list.

==Plotting==
In the following years, Beck lived in retirement in his Berlin apartment and ceased to have any meaningful influence on German military affairs. His opposition to Hitler had brought him in contact with a small number of senior officers intent on deposing the dictator, and his home became the headquarters of the small circle of opposition. He increasingly came to rely on contacts with the British in the hope that London would successfully exert its influence on Hitler through threats and warnings, but he failed.

Beck and his conspirators knew that Germany faced certain and rapid defeat if France and Britain helped Czechoslovakia in 1938. Accordingly, they contacted the British Foreign Office, informed Britain of their plot and asked for a firm British warning to deter Hitler from attacking Czechoslovakia. In September 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier and Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini signed the Munich Agreement, which handed the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia to Germany. That ended the crisis and hence Beck&#x27;s efforts at a &quot;putsch&quot;.

In the autumn of 1939, Beck was in contact with German Army officers, politicians, and civil servants, including General Halder, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, Carl Goerdeler, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris and Colonel Hans Oster about the possibility of staging a &quot;putsch&quot; to overthrow the Nazi regime. By then, Beck had come to accept that it was not possible to overthrow the Nazi regime if that meant keeping Hitler in power. After a successful &quot;putsch&quot;, Germany was to be governed by a triumvirate of Beck, Goerdeler and Schacht, who would negotiate a peace with Britain and France that would allow Germany to keep most of its conquests, including Austria, all of western Poland and the Reich Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia.

In the early stages of the war, after Poland had been overrun but before France and the Low Countries had been attacked, the German Resistance sought the assistance of Pope Pius XII in preparations for a coup to oust Hitler. Josef Müller was despatched on a clandestine mission to Rome. The Vatican considered Müller to be a representative of Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation between the plotters and the Allies.

The Pope, communicating with Britain&#x27;s Francis d&#x27;Arcy Osborne, channelled communications back and forth in secrecy. The British were non-committal, but the Resistance were encouraged by the talks. In January to February 1940, a series of meetings between Goerdeler, Beck, Ulrich von Hassell and Johannes Popitz produced agreement that when the Nazi regime was overthrown, Beck was to head the Council of Regency, which would govern Germany. In 1940 and 1941, Beck spent much time discussing with Goerdeler, Hassell and Erwin von Witzleben aspects of the proposed state after the successful overthrow of the regime.

==20 July plot==

In 1943, Beck planned two abortive attempts to kill Hitler by means of a bomb. In May 1944, a memorandum by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel made it clear that his participation in the proposed &quot;putsch&quot; was based on the condition of Beck serving as the head of state in the new government. In 1944, Beck was one of the driving forces of the 20 July plot, along with Carl Goerdeler and Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. It was proposed that Beck would become &quot;Reichsverweser&quot; (regent) and head of the provisional government that would assume power in Germany after Hitler had been eliminated.

The plot failed, however, and by the evening, Beck was in the custody of General Friedrich Fromm. Beck requested permission to keep his private pistol with the intention to commit suicide to avoid torture by the Gestapo. He shot himself in the head but succeeded only in severely wounding himself, and one of Fromm&#x27;s men was brought in to administer the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; by shooting Beck in the back of the neck. Beck, along with other conspirators, was buried in secret that night.

==Personal life==
In Bremen on 12 May 1916, Beck married Amalie Christine Auguste Luise Pagenstecher, who had been born in Bremen on 6 May 1893. In her youth Amalie had been treated for tuberculosis at the Stillachhaus Sanatorium in Oberstdorf. She had been advised by its head, Dr Luebhard Saathoff, never to have children. Following her marriage, he was persuaded to change his opinion. Amalie gave birth to Gertrud Beck on 1 January 1917 in Wiesbaden, Hassen-Nassau, Preussen. Nine months later, on 16 November 1917, Amalie died in the sanatorium.

Beck was serving on the Western Front at the time of his wife’s death and had little interest in his five-year-old child. Consequently, Dr Saathoff took responsibility for her and she joined his family of five children and several adopted children. From the age of 14, Gertrud began living permanently with her father. 
Following the start of World War II, to avoid being conscripted into the labour service, she moved to a family friend&#x27;s forestry estate in East Prussia. Here she met Gunther Neubaur, who was born on 18 October 1915. Despite already being engaged and his parents objecting, since at 23 they considered her to be too young, the couple went ahead and married in Berlin on 2 March 1940. Their daughter was born in January 1941. Neubaur was serving as a Hauptmann (captain) when he was shot near Leningrad and died on 10 February 1942 while on the way to hospital.

In 1944, considering the risk from Allied bombing to be high, Beck arranged for Gertrud and her daughter to stay with her Neubaur in-laws in Oberstdorf due to its remote location in the Bavarian Alps. They were still there at the time of the failed plot to kill Hitler. Eight days after the event, two members of the Gestapo visited her and requested that she accompany them. Her sister-in-law, Annemarie, was present and suggested that since it was late in the day they should have dinner at a nearby hotel and stay the night there. After the Gestapo had left to take up the suggestion, the two women burnt any incriminating letters and documents that they could find. The next morning the Gestapo took her to Munich, her three-year-old daughter remaining behind in the village. Eventually the Gestapo released her from prison and she returned to Oberstdorf, where she spent the rest of her life, dying in 2008.

==Portrayals in media==
The character of Beck appears in all film, literary, and TV dramatisations of the July 1944 plot, being played by Werner Hinz in &quot;The Plot to Assassinate Hitler&quot; (1955), Karl Ludwig Diehl in &quot;Jackboot Mutiny&quot; (1955), Ian Richardson in &quot;The Plot to Kill Hitler&quot; (1990), Remo Girone in &quot;Stauffenberg&quot; (2004) and Terence Stamp in &quot;Valkyrie&quot; (2008).

<text>The Kusunda () or Ban Raja (&quot;people of the forest&quot;), known to themselves as the Mihaq or Myahq or Myahak), are a tribe of former hunter-gatherers of the forests of western Nepal, who are now intermarried with neighboring peoples and settled in villages.

In 1968 American anthropologist Johan Reinhard located a few of the last surviving Kusunda near Gorkha in Central Nepal, and in 1969 and 1975 he found further members in Dang and Surkhet valleys in western Nepal, collecting basic linguistic and ethnographic data (see references below). Shortly earlier, in about 1956, René Nebesky-Wojokowitz wrote a report after he was told by villagers of Kusundas conducting silent trade with Nepali farmers. The Kusunda were said to have brought a deer hunted recently and left it for a farm household with the unspoken expectation that the farmers would give the Kusunda farm goods.

The Kusunda mainly hunted birds resting in trees at night with bows and exceptionally long (ca. 160 cm) unfeathered arrows, which were poorly suited for the hunting of land animals. Their custom of eating only the meat of wild animals extended until recent times. The Kusunda are followers of animism, though Hindu overtones may be seen in their religious rituals. According to the 2011 Nepal census, there are a total of 273 ethnic Kusunda. In 2001 Census, there were 164 Kusunda of whom 160 were Hindus and 4 were Buddhists. The Nepali word &quot;Kusunda&quot; originally meant &quot;savage&quot;, as the neighboring Chepang and other groups traditionally thought of them as savages.

==Kusunda language==
Watters (2005) published a mid-sized grammatical description of the Kusunda language, plus vocabulary, which shows that Kusunda is indeed a language isolate. Nepali is now their language of everyday communication. The language is almost moribund, with no children learning it, as all Kusunda speakers have married outside their ethnicity. Only one speaker survives in Nepal, an elderly woman.

<text>The DeWitt Clinton of the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad (M&amp;H) was an American steam locomotive and the first working steam locomotive built for service in New York state.

The locomotive was built in 1831 and began operations the same year. It was named in honor of DeWitt Clinton, the governor of New York State responsible for the Erie Canal, a competitor to the railroad. Portions of the steam engine were cast at the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring, New York. The &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot;″s first run was from the city of Albany, New York, to Schenectady, New York, a run of 16 or 17 miles. Its passenger cars were made of stagecoach bodies in which riders would sit either inside or on outdoor rumble seats. The cars were known as Goold cars and were named after coach builder James Goold of Albany.

The locomotive was scrapped in 1833. The M&amp;H became part of the New York Central Railroad (NYCR) system in 1853. The New York Central Railroad built a replica of the locomotive for display at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. This replica would continue to be used for promotional purposes until it was purchased by Henry Ford in 1934. Since then, it has been on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

== Design ==
The original &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; was a 0-4-0 locomotive which measured 12 feet 10 inches in length and weighed 6,758 pounds, while its 1893 replica was heavier at a weight of 9,420 pounds. The locomotive had a design very similar to future locomotive designs with a horizontal boiler and a smokestack at the front. The top of the smokestack rested at about 12 feet off the ground. The locomotive also had an early flatbed tender to store its fuel.   

== DeWitt Clinton (Governor) ==
DeWitt Clinton was born on March 2, 1769, in Little Britain, New York. Clinton entered politics in 1790 and for the next five years worked as a secretary for his uncle, Governor George Clinton. DeWitt Clinton served in the New York House of Representatives from 1797 to 1798, the New York Senate from 1798 to 1802, and the United States Senate from 1802-1803. From 1803 to 1815, Clinton was the mayor of New York City.

From 1810 to 1824, Clinton was New York Canal Commissioner. Construction of the Erie Canal under Clinton would begin in 1817 and continue until 1825, when the Canal was officially opened. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company (the owner of the &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; locomotive) would be founded two years later in 1826. During the construction of the Erie Canal, Clinton was governor of New York State. He held from office from 1817 to 1823 and was re-elected in 1825. After 38 years of political service, DeWitt Clinton died on February 11, 1828, at the age of 58. The steam locomotive named in his honor would be completed in 1831 or three years after his death.     

== Mohawk and Hudson Railroad ==
Incorporated in 1826 at Albany, the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad Company was the first railroad company in the state of New York. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad was named after the two rivers the company hoped to connect; the Hudson river in Albany and the Mohawk river in Schenectady. The state of New York had a set of waterways between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes which had been used for transport since before colonization. These waterways would become the basis for the Erie Canal between Albany and Buffalo in 1825. It was during this time that railroads were being considered as a faster, more efficient alternative to waterways. The construction of the M&amp;H was overseen by its two directors, George William Featherstonhaugh and Stephen Van Rensselaer, with no other directors being identified in the charter.  

Due to its increasing urban population, a route alongside the Erie Canal was considered the most logical option for the first New York railroad. In order to construct the new railroad, the railroad company had to overcome political opposition fueled by the popularity of the Erie Canal; opposition which would only cease by the 1860s, as canals were becoming obsolete in favor of the more efficient railroads. The canal distance between Albany to the south and Schenectady to the north was about 22 or 23 miles. With a railroad, goods and passengers would be able to travel from one city to the other in a straight line, or a distance of only 16 or 17 miles. Featherstonhaugh argued that the railroad would reduce the travel time between Albany and Schenectady from 2 or 3 days to 3 hours. On March 27, 1826 a bill was passed in Congress and Featherstonhaugh and Rensselaer were granted a sum of $300,000-$500,000 for the construction of one of the first chartered railroads in American history.

== Original &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; ==

In 1831, the M&amp;H constructed its first locomotive, the &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot;. The locomotive was then delivered by boat on July 25, and given its first test run on July 30. The test showed that the &quot;Clinton&quot; was unable to make much heat from its supply of Lackawanna coal, and only reached a top speed 7 miles per hour. To solve this problem, the railroad decided to replace the coal with coke. On August 3, another test was conducted with the substitute fuel. This time, the &quot;Clinton&quot; made the run between Albany and Schenectady in an hour and 45 minutes. This equates to an average speed of about 9–10 miles per hour.

August 9, 1831 was the day &quot;Clinton&quot; made its first passenger run on the same line. The locomotive was attached to a train of three coaches from Goold works in Albany. These three coaches were part of a collection of six specifically designed by James Goold for the M&amp;H. The so-called “Goold Cars” were built from six stagecoach bodies and sold to the M&amp;H for $310 a piece. Each coach could accommodate between 15 and 18 passengers. During its inaugural run, the locomotive impressed its passengers by completing the run in a record 38 minutes, with an average speed of 25–27 miles per hour. A similar trip on the Erie Canal, by comparison, would have taken hours due to a longer route and boats being slowed down by more than a dozen locks.

The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad was officially opened on September 24, 1831.

After 2–3 years of continued service, the &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; was eventually scrapped by the railroad in 1833.     

== &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; replica ==
After the original &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; was scrapped, the M&amp;H’s successor, the New York Central Railroad (NYCR) built a full-scale, operational reproduction of the &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; for the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The fair was held that year to mark the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492. This replica was accompanied by replicas of the original Goold cars.

Since its first appearance at the World’s Fair of 1893, the &quot;Clinton&quot; replica continued to work as an engaging promotional device for the railroad in many subsequent locations until it was purchased by Henry Ford in 1934 with the condition that it still travel periodically to fairs and expositions on behalf of the NYCR. After being purchased by Ford, the replica would continue to make appearances at NYCR fairs, expositions and other promotional events up until the 1950s. The &quot;DeWitt Clinton&quot; replica, along with the replicas of the Goold cars, has been kept on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, since its removal from service.

<text>An electrostatic loudspeaker (ESL) is a loudspeaker design in which sound is generated by the force exerted on a membrane suspended in an electrostatic field.

==Design and functionality==

The speakers use a thin flat diaphragm usually consisting of a plastic sheet coated with a conductive material such as graphite sandwiched between two electrically conductive grids, with a small air gap between the diaphragm and grids. For low distortion operation, the diaphragm must operate with a constant charge on its surface, rather than with a constant voltage. This is accomplished by either or both of two techniques: the diaphragm&#x27;s conductive coating is chosen and applied in a manner to give it a very high surface resistivity, and/or a large value resistor is placed in series between the EHT (Extra High Tension or Voltage) power supply and the diaphragm (resistor not shown in the diagram here). However, the latter technique will still allow distortion as the charge will migrate across the diaphragm to the point closest to the &quot;grid&quot; or electrode thereby increasing the force moving the diaphragm; this will occur at audio frequency so the diaphragm requires a high resistance (megohms) to slow the movement of charge for a practical speaker.

The diaphragm is usually made from a polyester film (thickness 2–20 μm) with exceptional mechanical properties, such as PET film. By means of the conductive coating and an external high voltage supply the diaphragm is held at a DC potential of several kilovolts with respect to the grids. The grids are driven by the audio signal; front and rear grid are driven in antiphase. As a result, a uniform electrostatic field proportional to the audio signal is produced between both grids. This causes a force to be exerted on the charged diaphragm, and its resulting movement drives the air on either side of it.

In virtually all electrostatic loudspeakers the diaphragm is driven by two grids, one on either side, because the force exerted on the diaphragm by a single grid will be unacceptably non-linear, thus causing harmonic distortion. Using grids on both sides cancels out voltage dependent part of non-linearity but leaves charge (attractive force) dependent part. The result is near complete absence of harmonic distortion. In one recent design, the diaphragm is driven with the audio signal, with the static charge located on the grids (Transparent Sound Solutions).

The grids must be able to generate as uniform an electric field as possible, while still allowing for sound to pass through. Suitable grid constructions are therefore perforated metal sheets, a frame with tensioned wire, wire rods, etc.

To generate a sufficient field strength, the audio signal on the grids must be of high voltage. The electrostatic construction is in effect a capacitor, and current is only needed to charge the capacitance created by the diaphragm and the stator plates (previous paragraphs referred to as grids or electrodes). This type of speaker is therefore a high-impedance device. In contrast, a modern electrodynamic cone loudspeaker is a low impedance device, with higher current requirements. As a result, impedance matching is necessary in order to use a normal amplifier. Most often a transformer is used to this end. Construction of this transformer is critical as it must provide a constant (often high) transformation ratio over the entire audible frequency range (i.e. large bandwidth) and so avoid distortion. The transformer is almost always specific to a particular electrostatic speaker. To date, Acoustat and Beveridge built the only commercial &quot;transformer-less&quot; electrostatic loudspeaker. In this design, the audio signal is applied directly to the stators from a built-in high-voltage valve amplifier (as valves are also high impedance devices), without use of a step-up transformer.

==Advantages==

Advantages of electrostatic loudspeakers include:
# the very low mass of the diaphragm, which is driven across its whole surface
# exemplary frequency response (both in amplitude and phase) because the principle of generating force and pressure is almost free from resonances unlike the more common electrodynamic driver.

Musical transparency can be better than in electrodynamic speakers because the radiating surface has much less mass than most other drivers and is therefore far less capable of storing energy to be released later. For example, a typical electrodynamic speaker driver can have a moving mass of tens or hundreds of grams, whereas an electrostatic membrane only has a mass of a few milligrams, several times less than the very lightest of electrodynamic tweeters. The concomitant air load, often insignificant in dynamic speakers, is usually tens of grams because of the large coupling surface, thus contributing to the damping of resonance buildup by the air itself to a significant, though not complete, degree. Electrostatics can also be executed as full-range designs, lacking the usual crossover filters and enclosures that could color or distort the sound.

Since many electrostatic speakers are tall and thin designs without an enclosure, they act as a vertical dipole line source. This makes for rather different acoustic behavior in rooms compared to conventional electrodynamic loudspeakers. Generally speaking, a large-panel dipole radiator is more demanding of a proper physical placement within a room when compared to a conventional box speaker, but, once there, it is less likely to excite bad-sounding room resonances, and its direct-to-reflected sound ratio is higher by some 4–5 decibels. This in turn leads to more accurate stereo reproduction of recordings that contain proper stereo information and venue ambience. Planar (flat) drivers tend to be very directional giving them good imaging qualities, on the condition that they have been carefully placed relative to the listener and the sound-reflecting surfaces in the room. Curved panels have been built, making the placement requirements a bit less stringent, but sacrificing imaging precision somewhat.

==Disadvantages==

Typical disadvantages include sensitivity to ambient humidity levels and a lack of bass response, due to phase cancellation from a lack of enclosure, but these are not shared by all designs. The bass rolloff 3db point occurs when the narrowest panel dimension equals a quarter wavelength of the radiated frequency for dipole radiators, so for a Quad ESL-63, which is 0.66 meters wide, this occurs at around 129 Hz, comparable to many box speakers (calculated with the speed of sound taken as 343 m/s). There is also the difficult physical challenge of reproducing low frequencies with a vibrating taut film with little excursion amplitude; however, as most diaphragms have a very large surface area compared to cone drivers, only small amplitude excursions are required to put relatively large amounts of energy out. While bass is lacking quantitatively (due to lower excursion than cone drivers) it can be of better quality (&#x27;tighter&#x27; and without &#x27;booming&#x27;) than that of electrodynamic (cone) systems. Phase cancellation can be somewhat compensated for by electronic equalization (a so-called shelving circuit that boosts the region inside the audio band where the generated sound pressure drops because of phase cancellation). Nevertheless &quot;maximum&quot; bass levels cannot be augmented because they are ultimately limited by the membrane&#x27;s maximum permissible excursion before it comes too close to the high-voltage stators, which may produce electrical arcing and burn holes through it. Recent, technically more advanced solutions for perceived lack of bass include the use of large, curved panels (Sound-Lab, MartinLogan CLS), electrostatic subwoofer panels (Audiostatic, Quad), and long-throw electrostatic elements allowing large diaphragm excursions (Audiostatic). Another trick often practiced is to step up the bass (20–80 Hz) with a higher transformation ratio than the mid and treble.

This relative lack of loud bass is often remedied with a hybrid design using a dynamic loudspeaker, e.g. a subwoofer, to handle lower frequencies, with the electrostatic diaphragm handling middle and high frequencies. Many feel that the best low frequency unit for hybrids are cone drivers mounted on open baffles as dipoles, transmission line woofers or horns, since they possess roughly the same qualities (at least in the bass) as electrostatic speakers, i.e. good transient response, little box coloration, and (ideally) flat frequency response. However, there is often a problem with integrating such a woofer with the electrostatics. This is because most electrostatics are line sources, the sound pressure level of which decreases by 3 dB for each doubling of distance. A cone speaker&#x27;s sound pressure level, on the other hand, decreases by 6 dB for each doubling of distance because it behaves as a point source. This can be overcome by the theoretically more elegant solution of using conventional cone woofers in an open baffle, or a push-pull arrangement, which produces a bipolar radiation pattern similar to that of the electrostatic membrane. This is still subject to phase cancellation, but cone woofers can be driven to far higher levels due to their longer excursion, thus making equalization to a flat response easier, and they add distortion thereby increasing the area (and therefore the power) under the frequency response graph, making the total low frequency energy higher but the fidelity to the signal lower.

An alternative is to enclose the electrostatic elements and operate them as &quot;monopoles.&quot; This avoids the many disadvantages of dipole operation, most importantly a great reduction in room reflections and thus also in adulteration of the recorded ambiance. Since there&#x27;s no attempt at making the speaker visually &quot;see-through&quot;, it also allows the application of materials to the rear of the panel to impart full damping of the membrane resonance, which improves transient response. In addition, using relatively small elements with a relatively high crossover frequency, such as 500 Hz, has a number of advantages. It reduces directivity to a degree that offers a reasonably wide sweet spot. It allows more of the 3 dB/octave increase in SPL with frequency to be used, increasing the sensitivity. It does not act as a true line array, so woofers are easier to integrate. Lastly, most of the remaining 3 dB roll-up can be counteracted by filtering the high frequencies from the signal to half or more of the width, which coincidentally widens the dispersion and thus the sweet spot. JansZen speakers incorporate all these alternative features. They also use acoustic suspension woofers (sealed enclosures), which have the lowest group delay of all configurations and thus the best chance of seamlessly integrating with the electrostatics. The panels are also well protected from collecting airborne contaminants, avoiding the need for periodic repairs.

The directionality of electrostatics can also be a disadvantage in that it means the &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; where proper stereo imaging can be heard is relatively small, limiting the number of people who can fully enjoy the advantages of the speakers simultaneously. In 1992 Critical Mass introduced the first electrostatic speakers for use in the mobile environment (car audio). Critical Mass engineer and CEO Wayde Alfarone&#x27;s design capitalized on the directional nature of electrostatics by creating separate sound fields for different seating locations in the vehicle.

Because of their tendency to attract dust, insects, conductive particles, and moisture, electrostatic speaker diaphragms will gradually deteriorate and need periodic replacement. They also need protection measures to physically isolate their high voltage parts from accidental contact with humans and pets. Cost-effective repair and restoration service is available for virtually every current and discontinued electrostatic loudspeaker model.

==Amateur-built speakers==
Electrostatic speakers enjoy some popularity among do-it-yourself (DIY) loudspeaker builders. They are one of the few types of speakers in which the transducers themselves can be built from scratch by an amateur as basic hardware for complete ESL DIY projects can be found available online. Such supplies include resistors and capacitors for RC circuit frequency equalization, if necessary; step-up transformers; perforated metal sheets or grids and insulating plastics for the stators; polymer film and conductive paint (e.g. a liquid graphite suspension) for the membrane; simple tensioning equipment for proper membrane tuning; and a frame, usually of wood, to hold everything together. A widely read resource by ESL enthusiasts is &quot;The Electrostatic Loudspeaker Design Cookbook&quot; () by notable ESL specialist Roger Sanders.

==Commercial speakers==
Arthur Janszen was granted in 1953 for an electrostatic loudspeaker. He had worked in the Navy to develop a low-distortion, high-frequency source for targeting torpedoes. After the war, he developed manufacturing technique for electrostatic speakers, to be used with conventional cone woofers, known as electrostatic hybrids. He licensed Neshaminy Electric to make these speakers.
In the early 1970s, Electronic Industries of Minneapolis took over the license and rights to make JansZen electrostatic speakers.
In 1974, Electronic Industries introduced a new wire wrap around ESL tweeter that greatly lowered the cost to manufacture. It proved to be extremely reliable. Several large arrays of these tweeters were used as public address systems in concerts in Minneapolis.

Ownership changed again in the late 1970s, and the company was bought. Plans were made to offer electrostatic speakers in cars, but they never came into production. Dave Wilson of Wilson audio, used JansZen tweeters in his famous, WAMM, Wilson Audio Modulator Monitor. That speaker sold for $220,000 a pair when it was discontinued.
The developers of the Tri-Ergon sound-on-film sound film system had developed a primitive design of electrostatic loudspeaker as early as 1919. David JansZen, son of Arthur JansZen, using his father&#x27;s papers and designs introduced his own version of electrostatic hybrid speakers. His company, still in business, was not connected to Electronic Industries JansZen speakers. Mr. Janszen&#x27;s company, JansZen still makes an evolved version of his original design. The KLH Nine was designed in the mid-1950s by Arthur A. Janszen, and thousands were sold after the design was brought over to KLH in 1959 and put into regular production. 

===Quad Electroacoustics===
The first fully successful full-range electrostatic speaker, and also among the most influential, was produced in 1957: the Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker (Quad ESL, later known as the ESL-57) from Quad Electroacoustics, of Huntingdon, England. These were shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They were widely admired for their clarity and precision, but can be difficult to run while achieving low frequency bass output.

The Quad ESLs were designed by Peter Walker, founder of the company, and David Williamson. The first in the series was the ESL-57, influenced by developed by Edward W. Kellogg for General Electric in 1934. It was introduced in 1955, put into commercial production in 1957, and discontinued only in 1985.

In 1981, Quad introduced the ESL-63 as a successor to the ESL-57. It attempted to address both the deficiency in bass reproduction of the ESL-57 and its extreme directionality at high frequencies. The latter goal is achieved by splitting the stators into eight concentric rings, each fed with a slight time delay compared to the ring immediately inwards, thereby attempting to emulate a point source.

Although the ESL-63 was discontinued in 1999, Quad maintains production of electrostatic speakers. Quad introduced the ESL-988 and its larger variant the ESL-989 in 1999, the ESL-2805 and ESL-2905 in 2005, and the ESL-2812 and ESL-2912 in 2017, that incorporate electronic and transducer refinements.

===Other manufacturers===
Popular manufacturers of electrostatic speakers include MartinLogan, KEF, Quad, SoundLab. Manufacturers who only make electrostatic-type speakers include SoundLab, Audiostatic, JansZen and Sanders Sound Systems (previously Innersound).

Other manufacturers currently producing electrostatic loudspeakers include Solosound, King&#x27;s Audio, Panphonics, Cadence Audio, T+A and Silberstatic, Blanko.nu. BenQ produces a portable electrostatic Bluetooth speaker. Audiostatic claim to make the only full range electrostatic loudspeaker.

MartinLogan, JansZen, Metrum Acoustics, Sanders Sound Systems, and Sound-Lab, and others build hybrid designs with conventional woofers or subwoofers.

Among electrostatic full-range speakers that are no longer made is the KLH 9, the earliest US full-range design, AHL Tolteque, Acoustat, Servo-Statik and Immersion from Australia.

<doc id="196049" wikidata="Q707432" url="?curid=196049" title="Edwin Drake">
<text>Edwin Laurentine Drake (March 29, 1819 – November 9, 1880), also known as Colonel Drake, was an American businessman and the first American to successfully drill for oil.

==Early life==
Drake was born in Greenville, New York, on March 29, 1819, the son of Lyman and Laura Drake. He grew up on family farms around New York state and Castleton, Vermont, before leaving home at the age of 19. He spent the early parts of his life working the railways around New Haven, Connecticut, as a clerk, express agent, and conductor. Drake was a Freemason.

==Career==
===Seneca Oil===

While petroleum oil was known prior to this, there was no appreciable market for it. Samuel Kier is credited with founding the first American oil refinery in Pittsburgh. He was the first person in the United States to refine crude oil into kerosene. Along with a new lamp to burn Kier&#x27;s product, a new market to replace whale oil as a lamp oil began to develop.

Seneca Oil Company, originally called the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company, was founded by George Bissell and Jonathan Eveleth. They created the company after hearing of reports that petroleum collected from an oil spring in Titusville, Pennsylvania, was suitable for use as lamp fuel. Until this time, the primary lamp fuel had been whale oil. Bissell found that the rock oil would be a practical alternative if a method could be devised to extract the oil from the ground. Interest in the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company was initially low until a report commissioned by Bissell and Eveleth showed that there was significant economic value in petroleum. Due to a disagreement between the shareholders and the pair, the company was split and Seneca Oil was formed in 1858. Before being offered a job by Bissell and Eveleth, Drake bought stock in Seneca Oil. But his job opportunity with the company arose because both parties were staying in the same hotel in Titusville. He was hired on a salary of $1,000 a year to investigate the oil seeps on land owned by Seneca Oil.

Drake was hired by the Seneca Oil Company to investigate suspected oil deposits in Titusville, Pennsylvania. James Townsend, President of the Seneca Oil Company, sent Drake to the site in the spring of 1858. The oil company chose the retired railway man partly because he had free use of the rail. Drake had no military experience, but Townsend gave him the title of &quot;Colonel&quot; in order to impress the local townspeople.

===Drake Well===
Drake decided to drill in the manner of salt well drillers. He purchased a steam engine in Erie, Pennsylvania, to power the drill. The well was dug on an island on the Oil Creek. It took some time for the drillers to get through the layers of gravel. At 16 feet (5 m) the sides of the hole began to collapse. Those helping him began to despair, but not Drake. It was at this point that he devised the idea of a drive pipe. This cast iron pipe consisted of joints. The pipe was driven down into the ground. At 32 feet (10 m) they struck bedrock. The drilling tools were now lowered through the pipe and steam was used to drill through the bedrock. The drilling, however, was slow. Progress was made at the rate of just three feet per day. After initial difficulty locating the necessary parts to build the well, which resulted in his well being nicknamed &quot;Drake&#x27;s Folly&quot;, Drake proved successful.

Crowds of people began to gather to jeer at the apparently unproductive operation. By 1859, Drake was also running out of money. Drake&#x27;s colleagues back in Connecticut gave up on finding any oil by April 1859 and after spending $2,500, Drake took out a $500 loan to keep the operation going. On August 27, 1859, Drake had persevered and his drill bit had reached a total depth of 69.5 feet (21 m). At that point the bit hit a crevice. The men packed up for the day. The next morning Drake’s driller, Billy Smith, looked into the hole in preparation for another day’s work. He was surprised and delighted to see crude oil rising up. Drake was summoned and the oil was brought to the surface with a hand pitcher pump. The oil was collected in a bath tub.

Drake is famous for pioneering a new method for producing oil from the ground. He drilled using piping to prevent borehole collapse, allowing for the drill to penetrate further and further into the ground. Previous methods for collecting oil had been limited. Ground collection of oil consisted of gathering it from where it occurred naturally, such as from oil seeps or shallow holes dug into the ground. Drake tried the latter method initially when looking for oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania. However, it failed to produce economically viable amounts of oil. Alternative methods of digging large shafts into the ground also failed, as collapse from water seepage almost always occurred. The significant step that Drake took was to drive a 32-foot iron pipe through the ground into the bedrock below. This allowed Drake to drill inside the pipe, without the hole collapsing from the water seepage. The principle behind this idea is still employed today by all companies drilling for hydrocarbons.

Claims of prior art exist, including in Bóbrka, Poland in 1854, Wietze, Germany in 1857, and Oil Springs, Ontario, Canada in 1858. The importance of the Drake Well near Titusville was that it prompted the first great wave of investment and additional drilling that established petroleum as a major industry. Within a day of Drake&#x27;s striking oil, Drake’s methods were being imitated by others along Oil Creek and in the immediate area. This culminated with the establishment of several oil boom towns along the creek. Drake&#x27;s well produced of oil a day. By 1872, the entire area was producing a day.

Drake set up a stock company to extract and market the oil. But, while his pioneering work led to the growth of an oil industry that made many people fabulously rich, for Drake riches proved elusive. Drake failed to patent his drilling invention, and proceeded to lose all of his savings in oil speculation in 1863. He ended up impoverished. In 1872, Pennsylvania voted an annuity of $1,500 to the &quot;crazy man&quot; whose determination founded the oil industry.

==Personal life==
In 1845, he married Philena Adams, who died while giving birth to their second child in 1854. Drake remarried three years later to Laura Dowd, sixteen years his junior, in 1857. During the summer of 1857, illness prevented Drake from carrying on with his job. He retained the privileges of a train conductor, including free travel on the railroads. In 1858, the Drake family relocated to Titusville, Pennsylvania and in 1874 to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania.

==Death==

He died on November 9, 1880, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He and his wife are interred in Titusville, Pennsylvania, next to a memorial built in his honor.

==Legacy==
In 1934, the Drake Well Museum was opened in Titusville, Pennsylvania, highlighting Drake&#x27;s career and role as the nation&#x27;s first successful oil driller.

==In popular culture==
*In 1954, Drake was portrayed by Vincent Price in &quot;Born In Freedom: The Story of Colonel Drake&quot;, sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute.
*The Lucky Luke adventure &quot;In the Shadow of the Derricks&quot; sees the main character travel to Titusville to help Drake against an enemy that wants to own all the region&#x27;s oil fields by all means.

<text>USS &quot;Rabaul&quot; was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage. She was delivered on 30 August 1946, but never commissioned. After spending 26 years in reserve, she was scrapped in 1973.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Rabaul&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==History==

The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The keel for &quot;Rabaul&quot; was laid down at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington on 29 January 1945. She was named for the island of Rabaul in New Georgia, a major Japanese base during World War II, which was neutralized during a lengthy campaign in 1943 and 1944. The ship was launched on 14 June, and was delivered to the US Navy on 30 August, shortly after the end of the war.

The ship was not commissioned, and was instead assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, based in Tacoma. Ten of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships saw significant service postwar as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carriers, but they were small and had difficulty operating the new Grumman AF Guardian patrol planes, so the rest of the class remained laid up, and they were soon replaced in the ASW role by much larger s. She was reclassified as a helicopter escort carrier, with the hull number CVHE-121, in June 1955. Three years later, in June 1958, she was moved to the San Diego Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

In May 1959, &quot;Rabaul&quot; was reclassified as an aircraft ferry, with the hull number AKV-121. In the mid-1960s, the US Army explored the concept of a Floating Aircraft Maintenance Facility (FAMF), and in September 1967, the Department of Defense selected &quot;Rabaul&quot; to be converted for FAMF II, but the project ultimately came to nothing. She remained part of the reserve fleet until she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1971. The ship was eventually sold for scrap on 25 August 1972 to the Nicholai Joffe Corporation, based in Beverly Hills, California. Shortly before scrapping, she was used in the closing scenes of the 1973 movie &quot;Magnum Force&quot;.

<doc id="196054" wikidata="Q830738" url="?curid=196054" title="Rocks (Aerosmith album)">
<text>Rocks is the fourth studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on 3 May 1976. AllMusic described &quot;Rocks&quot; as having &quot;captured Aerosmith at their most raw and rocking.&quot; &quot;Rocks&quot; was ranked number 366 on the updated &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2020. It has influenced many hard rock and heavy metal artists, including Guns N&#x27; Roses, Metallica, and Nirvana. The album was a commercial success, charting three singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, two of which reached the Top 40 (&quot;Back in the Saddle&quot; and &quot;Last Child&quot;). The album was one of the first to ship platinum when it was released, and has since gone quadruple platinum.

==Background==
Previously, Aerosmith had recorded three albums: &quot;Aerosmith&quot; (1973), &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; (1974), and the breakthrough LP &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1975), which produced Top Ten hit &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and the popular &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;. Although often derided by critics, the band had amassed a loyal fanbase from relentless touring and their ferocious live shows. Producer Douglas explains, &quot;The only thing we were talking about a few months before Rocks was that it was going to be a real hard-rock album. And we might go back to the format of the first album, which was to rock out on every tune. And again, keep it real raw. And make it as live sounding as we possibly could.&quot; By the time of the album&#x27;s sessions, the group had already begun living the rock-and-roll lifestyle to the hilt, indulging their already considerable appetite for drugs. However, their hedonistic lifestyle did not appear to hamper them creatively; &quot;Rocks&quot; was considered by many fans, critics, and fellow musicians to be one of the highlights of their career. Guitarist Joe Perry later recalled, &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt we were doing a lot of drugs by then, but whatever we were doing, it was still working for us.&quot;

==Writing==
In the 1997 band memoir &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, guitarist Brad Whitford states that the band began work on the album by backing the Record Plant&#x27;s mobile recording truck into their rehearsal space, named the Wherehouse, and &quot;let fly... We were living the high life and not paying attention to anything except making this record. I had the beginnings of &quot;Last Child&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault.&quot; Tom had &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; that became &quot;Sick as a Dog.&quot; We had &#x27;Tit for Tat&#x27;... which turned into &#x27;Rats in the Cellar.&#x27; We cut all the basic tracks except two there.&quot; Producer Jack Douglas later insisted: &quot;Rocks&quot; was the album where Tom and Brad had a lot more input and songs... This was a big album for Aerosmith. It had to make a big statement about how loud and hard they were, how unapologetic they felt about being who they werethis brash, rude, sexual, hard-core rock band. 

The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Back in the Saddle&quot; was written by Perry on six-string bass. In 1997, Perry explained to Alan di Perna of &quot;Guitar World&quot; that he was inspired by Peter Green to write the riff on a Fender Bass VI and admitted that he was &quot;very high on heroin when I wrote &#x27;Back in the Saddle.&#x27; That riff just floated right through me.&quot; He further describes it as &quot;the kind of riff and instrumentation that falls outside the normal formula of a rock song. I wrote it on a six string bass. It was one of those songs that really opened things up for us.&quot; Tyler explains that the song uses the &quot;saddle image as a way of saying, &#x27;Here&#x27;s another album, folks, and we&#x27;re gonna rock out and I&#x27;ve really got my spurs on&#x27;.&quot; He continues in his memoir, &quot;Back in the Saddle&quot; I hoped would be nostalgic, hearkening to the spirit of every Spaghetti Western I ever saw. The band played like the gods they were. Jack mixed it with Jay in the way you hear it today.&quot;

&quot;Last Child&quot; is credited to guitarist Brad Whitford and Tyler. Tyler explains, &quot;Brad wrote, &#x27;Take me back to sweet Tallahassee, home sweet home…&#x27;&quot; recalled Tyler. &quot;Whatever he put into &#x27;Last Child&#x27;, that&#x27;s his moment. He can take that, and that&#x27;s his, forever.&quot; The song evolved from a riff Whitford titled &quot;Soul Saver&quot;, a recording of which was released on &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; in 1991.

&quot;Sick as a Dog&quot; is credited to Tyler and Tom Hamilton. The bassist explains, &quot;I think I came up with the verse part first. And then I did the parts for the intro, the B to E part, and then came up with this little, jangling arpeggio thing... I&#x27;m such a Byrds fan; it comes from that.&quot; As Hamilton later remembered, it was &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; that was especially influential on him personally when it came to his eventual contributions to the song that became &quot;Sick as a Dog.&quot; &quot;It really embedded in my mind that love of hearing [guitar sounds like that], especially when it was combined with a hard rock beat. Perry shared how they ended up dividing things up instrumentally in the studio: &quot;Tom played rhythm guitar on &quot;Sick as a Dog.&quot; I played bass for the first half of the song. Then I put the bass down and played guitar in the end, and Steven picked up the bass and played it for the rest of the songall live in the studio! One take. Hamilton remembers Douglas&#x27; assistance in developing the song: &quot;Jack is a very open person. He always has time for what people come up with. &quot;Sick&quot; started on guitar and I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but playing it for Jack, I realized it had a lot of potential. We recorded it last, and I&#x27;m glad because everybody was hot then.&quot;

&quot;Rats in the Cellar&quot; evolved from Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot;, a staple of the band&#x27;s early setlists. In his memoir, Tyler states that the title &quot;Rats in the Cellar&quot; is a &quot;tip of the hat, or an answer to &#x27;Toys in the Attic&#x27;... Meanwhile, in real life, &#x27;Rats&#x27; was more like what was actually going on. Things were coming apart, sanity was scurrying south, caution was flung to the winds, and little by little the chaos was permanently moving in.&quot; 

&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Fault&quot; remains a favorite of the band&#x27;s, with Tyler calling it &quot;one of the highlights of my creative career&quot; and Kramer insisting &quot;it&#x27;s some of the best drumming I did.&quot; According to Tyler, the lyrics: &quot;have to do with earthquakes, which we were scared of, along with flying&quot;.

&quot;Lick and a Promise&quot; is about the band&#x27;s determination to deliver a rocking live show. 

&quot;Combination&quot; features Perry sharing lead vocal duties with Tyler for the first time, and the guitarist admitted in 1997 that the song was &quot;about heroin, cocaine, and me&quot;. In his memoir, Tyler calls the line &quot;Walkin&#x27; on Gucci wearing Yves St. Laurent/Barely stay on &#x27;cause I&#x27;m so goddamn gaunt&quot; the best lyric Perry ever wrote: &quot;It was the truth, it was clever, and it described us to a tee&quot;. Regarding his vocal on the song, Perry later commented, &quot;This was touchy because singing was Steven&#x27;s jealously guarded territory... Beyond that, anytime the spotlight shone on me I detected a bit of jealousy from the other guys. After a while, though, the band came around and supported me, as long as I sang the song as a semi-duet with Steven.&quot; 

&quot;Home Tonight&quot; features Tyler on piano, Perry on a lap steel guitar as a lead guitar and his Les Paul for the rhythm guitar, and has drummer Joey Kramer, Tom Hamilton, and producer/arranger Jack Douglas performing backing vocals. Of the song Perry recalled, &quot;Steven could always be counted on to come up with some little piano riff that would be our ballad for the record. And that was it.&quot;

==Recording==
Unlike their previous two records, which were recorded at the Record Plant studios in Manhattan, for &quot;Rocks&quot;, the group rented a rehearsal space in suburban Massachusetts, the Wherehouse and employed a mobile studio to cut the record. Backing tracks for six of the songs were completed at the Wherehouse. Douglas explains: &quot;It&#x27;s the one record, of all the records that I&#x27;ve done, where every element is right and in its place. Every lyric, every key, every sound. Everything is right about that record, for what it is. Because it was written and conceived and recorded in the same place, in A. Wherehouse in Waltham, Mass. So we had the place where they used to rehearse. It was done in the dead of winter, and they would come in to record with nothing but a few licks...and we would develop these tunes.&quot; He continues, &quot;we cut all the basics at their rehearsal space, the Wherehouse, in Boston&#x27;s suburbs. A big, metal, roaring, huge room. I used stage monitors in with them to blow the sound right back at them. And that&#x27;s when they started to stretch out. Joe would ask what he ought to be listening to and I&#x27;d hip him to John Coltrane for solo ideas - and he&#x27;d try to get that! Even in pre-production, I knew it was great. I have cassettes of the evolution of every song on that record, and you should hear &quot;Back In The Saddle&quot; as it evolved from Joe&#x27;s basic lick to the monster it became. Wanna know what the secret to Rocks was? Distortion. Everything is totally over-loaded. When I brought it to the record company, they panicked at first, but not for long.&quot;

At the end of February 1976, the band resumed sessions at the Record Plant to complete the remaining backing tracks and record vocals for the album. Writing lyrics for the songs proved to be the most difficult stage in the album&#x27;s production. Douglas explains, &quot;Steven moves in with me when we&#x27;re working on an album. In the morning, I wake him up with a cassette and a cup of coffee; most of the melody lines have all been worked out and he&#x27;s singing phonetically. I&#x27;ll suggest a thing to him here and there, give him a kick this way and he starts to come around. He&#x27;s really the main drive of the band&quot; Record World.

&quot;Back in the Saddle&quot; features the sound of a whip by whirling a thirty-foot cord in the middle of six Neumann mikes and adding a cap gun for the cracking sound effect. A real bullwhip was intended to be used for the whip effects and hours were spent trying to get it to crack. The band members ended up cut up and hurt without making any progress. The first verse features the sound of clinking spurs, which was actually produced using bells and tambourines strapped to Tyler&#x27;s cowboy boots by Perry and New York Dolls singer David Johansen. The song is also notable for the slow buildup of the drum beat and guitar riff in the beginning of the song, as well as the sound effects of a galloping horse. Tyler achieved the hoofbeat sound using coconuts from a percussion kit he ordered from SIR Studio Instrument Rentals.

Producer Douglas acknowledges the pervasiveness of drug use during the album&#x27;s sessions: &quot;Labels were giving them drugs. It was written into the project, and in the case of Columbia, they had guys who delivered it to you. And they finally got busted for that, people lost their jobs and it became a huge scandal. Columbia Records: If they could keep you doing coke, then the records would get done faster. That was their philosophy. And you know, for those guys, they did quite a bit. But then you gotta come down, and you gotta find something to come down with. So it&#x27;s either pills or heroin. So through &quot;Toys&quot;, everything was fine, it was working. &quot;Rocks&quot;, that&#x27;s a pretty drug-fueled record, but it was really working. It was a dark record, too.&quot; Bassist Tom Hamilton remembers the dangers, &quot;There is something about being high that makes you look at things differently. But that period for some people can be relatively short. I think [drugs] all gave us energy and concentration. It was beneficial for a while. But in a few years it became so destructive. It was just so awful. We worked hard to be able to play with feelings and really tight, and then after &quot;Rocks,&quot; it fell apart. We started making a lot of money, and that was the beginning of the end.

Douglas expresses his satisfaction with the album&#x27;s production and sound: &quot;Rocks was done in Waltham, Massachusetts, in a warehouse. The keys the songs were written in were all dependent on the environment we were in. After a couple of weeks of rehearsal, the room started to sound really good. The very thought of moving it out of that room seemed like it would destroy everything about where we were. It was 100 percent written in the room—not including the lyrics because the lyrics always came last—but Steven&#x27;s melodies. That record, when I put it on, sounds like truth. To this day, I still feel that that album is closest to a really true statement and it was because the environment in which it was written was the same environment in which it was recorded.&quot; Perry remembers, &quot;With Rocks we had more confidence. We still had to write stuff on the spot, but that was the one where we had more of a handle on the creativity. Not to say that the pressure wasn&#x27;t on. We were touring constantly, we only took time off to go in the studio. No one said: &#x27;Take a month off, go write some songs.&#x27; It was like: &#x27;Go in the studio with whatever ideas you have.&#x27; That was how it was. &quot;Toys&quot; was kind of the softball album, and &quot;Rocks&quot; was the one were we felt: &#x27;Wow, we&#x27;re there&#x27;.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==

Contemporary reviews were mixed. John Milward of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;the material is &quot;Rocks&quot;’ major flaw, mostly pale remakes of their earlier hits&quot;; concluding that the return to the &quot;ear-boxing sound&quot; of &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; and Tyler&#x27;s vocal performance cannot save the album from mediocrity. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote that Aerosmith were doing a good job of imitating Led Zeppelin, and that after this album the band began to lose steam.

Modern reviews are very positive. Greg Prato of AllMusic describes &quot;Rocks&quot; as &quot;a superb follow-up to their masterwork &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;&quot; that captures &quot;Aerosmith at their most raw and rocking&quot;. He writes that &quot;Back in the Saddle and Last Child are among their most renowned songs, but all the tracks prove essential to the makeup of the album&quot;. Ben Mitchell of &quot;Blender&quot; said that the members&#x27; drug use actually helped &quot;Rocks&quot;. He also called the album &quot;raw.&quot; In a November 1994 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; review of &quot;Rocks&quot;, Jon Matsumoto opined that the record &quot;arguably is the best heavy metal opus ever concocted&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff described the album as &quot;a screamin&#x27; mercury-shattering rock festival, live, overblown, decadent, and very American&quot;, concluding that &quot;on &quot;Rocks&quot; the band&#x27;s talent is anything but wasted.&quot;

Many musicians have cited &quot;Rocks&quot; as a favorite:
* &quot;Rocks&quot; was one of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s favorite albums, as he listed in his &quot;Journals&quot;.
* In 2003, the album was ranked number 176 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, before it was dropped to 366 in a 2020 revised list.
* Mötley Crüe songwriter and bassist Nikki Sixx refers to Aerosmith frequently in his book &quot;The Heroin Diaries&quot;.
*Metallica leader James Hetfield has identified &quot;Rocks&quot;, as well as Aerosmith, as important influences in his music, stating that the band was the reason why he wanted to learn guitar.
* Slash says &quot;Rocks&quot; was the album that inspired him to learn guitar, and that the album changed his life:

In his autobiography &quot;Rocks&quot;, Joe Perry states the driving purpose of &quot;Rocks&quot; &quot;was to reidentify us as America&#x27;s ultimate garage band, with blistering guitars, blistering vocals, balls-to-the-wall smash-your-eardrums production... The cover showed five diamonds, one for each of us. We saw that record as a jewel, the culmination of all our angst and anger and excitement and joy as go-for-broke rock and rollers.&quot;

<doc id="196057" wikidata="Q683019" url="?curid=196057" title="Toys in the Attic (album)">
<text>Toys in the Attic is the third studio album by American rock band Aerosmith, released on April 8, 1975, by Columbia Records. Its first single, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, was released on May 19 and the original version of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; followed on August 28 in the same year. The album is the band&#x27;s most commercially successful studio LP in the United States, with nine million copies sold, according to the RIAA. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 228 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The album&#x27;s title track and their collaboration with Run-DMC on a cover version of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; are included on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

==Background==
For Aerosmith&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Get Your Wings&quot;, the band had begun working with record producer Jack Douglas, who co-produced that album with Ray Colcord. In the liner notes to the 1993 reissue of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, it was said by an unnamed member of the group that they &quot;nailed&quot; the album.

According to Douglas, &quot;Aerosmith was a different band when we started the third album. They&#x27;d been playing &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; on the road for a year and had become better players - different. It showed in the riffs that Joe [Perry] and Brad [Whitford] brought back from the road for the next album. &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; was a much more sophisticated record than the other stuff they&#x27;d done.&quot; In the band memoir &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, guitarist Joe Perry stated, &quot;When we started to make &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, our confidence was built up from constant touring.&quot; In his autobiography, Perry elaborated:

==Writing==
Aerosmith&#x27;s third album includes some of their best-known songs, including &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, and the title track. The band entered the sessions with just three or four songs, and for the first time, wrote most of the material while recording. Prior to the sessions, the group booked rehearsal time to write material, shape the songs, and prepare for the recording sessions. Douglas explains, 

Tyler would write lyrics as the music was completed. Douglas explains, &quot;Steven was a tormented lyricist — a brilliant lyricist, but absolutely tormented, and as time went on, he became more and more tormented to come up with lyrics. The band, and particularly Joe, could just rip out these great riffs. Steven was a brilliant lyricist, and funny, and self-deprecating and aware of what was going on in the world and what was going on in the streets, but he had set a bar for himself that was so high that it was really difficult for him. Perry continues, &quot;It is really hard to have everything make sense, tell a story rhythmically, rhyme, fit in the fabric, and he&#x27;s got his own demons that he has to satisfy. He would basically take the tracks, and put headphones on and just walk around wherever he could, whether it was walking around the block in New York or at his house walking around the yard, or walking around the neighborhood, and he would just kind of sing along to it until he got something.&quot;

Perry remembers their creative process during the sessions, and writing the title track, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;: &quot;&quot;Toys&quot; was the first time we went in the studio without a whole album&#x27;s worth of songs. We had to write some in the studio. Jack Douglas said: &#x27;We need one more rocker.&#x27; And I sat on an amp and just started playing a riff. It was the riff to the song &quot;Toys In The Attic&quot;. Tyler adds, &quot;Joe was jamming a riff and I started yelling, &#x27;Toys, toys, toys...&#x27; Organic, immediate, infectious... I just started singing and it fit like chocolate and peanut butter. Joe plays his ass off on that song.&quot;

&quot;Uncle Salty&quot; is credited to both Tyler and bassist Hamilton, who came up with the riff. He explains, &quot;I came up with it within the first year the band was together. Then we didn&#x27;t use it until the third album. That&#x27;s typical with me. I&#x27;ll come up with a musical idea and be very reluctant to show it to people. I guess it&#x27;s just inhibitions that I&#x27;ve got to work on breaking down, because it usually works out really well when I finally do get up the gumption to show it to people.&quot; Tyler recalls writing the lyrics in his 2001 autobiography, &quot;Here I was thinking about an orphanage when I wrote those lyrics. I&#x27;d try to make the melody weep from the sadness felt when a child is abandoned.&quot; Tyler continues, &quot;Salty worked in a home for lost children and had his way with this little girl. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s about. I&#x27;m the little girl, the orphaned boy. I put myself in that place. I&#x27;m Uncle Salty too.&quot;

Of the biblical &quot;Adam&#x27;s Apple&quot;, Tyler says, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember anything except I arranged it and must have fought for credit. And I originally wanted to call the album &quot;Love at First Bite&quot; after the line in the song.&quot;

The album also features a cover of Bull Moose Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Big Ten-Inch Record&quot;, an R&amp;B hit recorded in 1952 and first heard by the band on a tape of Dr. Demento&#x27;s radio show on KMET. Tyler explains, &quot;Years ago I had this friend who would send me tapes of his radio show, and that&#x27;s how we ended up covering &quot;Big Ten-Inch Record.&quot; Demento is a wonderful guy.&quot; Rather than produce a rock reimagining, Aerosmith&#x27;s cover largely stays true to the original song, down to its jazz-style instrumentation. Brad Whitford explains, &quot;We heard the original and played it for laughs. We played it for our producer and he said &#x27;Let&#x27;s do it. Not only that, let&#x27;s do it like they did it then, with the horns and everything&#x27;. We thought, &#x27;Hey, that might be a good idea&#x27;.&quot;

Bassist Tom Hamilton came up with the main riff on &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, partially inspired by the Jeff Beck composition &quot;Rice Pudding&quot;. Hamilton explains its history: &quot;Believe it or not, the intro to the song and the bass part that I play during the verses, were written while I was in high school. I just kept it in the back of my mind for years... at the end of the recording for the tracks for &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, we still didn&#x27;t have that song. That song was never planned to be on the album. Our producer one day said, &#x27;It&#x27;s jam day, we got the tracks done, so if anyone has any extra ideas floating around, lets hear it now.&#x27; I said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got these parts,&#x27; and I showed the guitar players how to play the guitar parts I wrote. By the end of the day we had the music done and Steven then put on the vocals.&quot; He continues, &quot;I wrote that line on bass, and I realized I should think of some guitar parts for it if I was ever going to get a chance to present it to the band. I didn&#x27;t think I ever would... Steven had the idea of taking that intro riff, which became the chorus bass line under the &quot;sweet emotion&quot; part, and transposing it into the key of E, and making it a really heavy Led Zeppelinesque thing. Producer Jack Douglas recalls, &quot;He had that bassline. And when Joey Kramer came in, he played on the twos and fours instead of the ones and threes, so he was playing on the backside of it. When we heard that, we went, &#x27;Oh, boy! Magic.&#x27;&quot; The song&#x27;s lyrics, particularly the first verse, were inspired by Tyler&#x27;s acrimonious relationship with Perry&#x27;s then-wife, Elyssa. Tyler explains, &quot;I was angry at Elyssa because she stole my boyfriend, my significant other, my partner in crime. It was like losing a brother. So now there was jealousy, this dark undercurrent humming along. And I put it into Sweet Emotion, which I pointed at Elyssa directly.&quot;

Tyler explains that &quot;No More No More&quot; was inspired by &quot;life on the road: boredom, disillusion, Holiday Inns, stalemate, jailbait. My diary.&quot; &quot;Sometimes I start thinking about having a wife and child, but the group is my carriage, pulling me right along, so I have no time for that now.&quot;

The most complex production on the album was &quot;You See Me Crying&quot;, a piano ballad that was heavily orchestrated. The song was written by Tyler with credit given to former Chain Reaction bandmate Don Solomon. Tyler had written the opening and closing piano melody years earlier, having played it during the coda to &quot;Dream On&quot; on &quot;1971: The Road Starts Hear&quot;.

===&quot;Walk This Way&quot;===
In interviews, the band and Douglas have extensively detailed the writing of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and each stage of its development. The song originated in December 1974 in Honolulu, Hawaii, where Aerosmith was opening for the Guess Who. During a soundcheck, Perry was &quot;fooling around with riffs and thinking about the Meters&quot;. Loving that band&#x27;s &quot;riffy New Orleans funk, especially &#x27;Cissy Strut&#x27; and &#x27;People Say&#x27;&quot;, he asked drummer Joey Kramer &quot;to lay down something flat with a groove on the drums&quot;, and the guitar riff to what would become &quot;Walk This Way&quot; just &quot;came off [his] hands.&quot; Needing a bridge, he&quot; played another riff and went there. But I didn&#x27;t want the song to have a typical, boring 1, 4, 5 chord progression. After playing the first riff in the key of C, I shifted to E before returning to C for the verse and chorus. By the end of the sound check, I had the basics of a song.&quot;

When singer Steven Tyler heard Perry playing that riff he &quot;ran out and sat behind the drums and [they] jammed.&quot; Tyler scatted &quot;nonsensical words initially to feel where the lyrics should go before adding them later.&quot;

When the group was halfway through recording &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; in early 1975 at Record Plant in New York City, they found themselves stuck for material. They had written three or four songs for the album, having &quot;to write the rest in the studio.&quot; They decided to give the song Perry had come up with in Hawaii a try, but it did not have lyrics or a title yet. Douglas explains, &quot;I told the band we needed one more up-tempo track, and Joe plays a burner, a thing so hot and hard and heavy that we&#x27;re just totally blown away. It was the last track and Steven was struggling. We recorded it, and we couldn&#x27;t come up with a lyric or a rhyme or a rhythm for a vocal. There was just no way that it had anything we could use. We thought we were going to have to lose the track, or maybe make it an instrumental, but it was so good and funky.&quot; Deciding to take a break from recording, band members and producer Jack Douglas went down to Times Square to see Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;. Returning to the studio, they were laughing about Marty Feldman telling Gene Wilder to follow him in the film, saying &quot;walk this way&quot; and limping. Douglas suggested this as a title for their song. But they still needed lyrics.

At the hotel that night, Tyler wrote lyrics for the song, but left them in the cab on the way to the studio next morning. He says: &quot;I must have been stoned. All the blood drained out of my face, but no one believed me. They thought I never got around to writing them.&quot; Upset, he took a cassette tape with the instrumental track they had recorded and a portable tape player with headphones and &quot;disappeared into the stairwell.&quot; He &quot;grabbed a few No. 2 pencils&quot; but forgot to take paper. He wrote the lyrics on the wall at &quot;the Record Plant&#x27;s top floor and then down a few stairs of the back stairway.&quot; After &quot;two or three hours&quot; he &quot;ran downstairs for a legal pad and ran back up and copied them down.&quot;

The lyrics, which tell the story of a teenage boy losing his virginity, are sung by Tyler with heavy emphasis being placed on the rhyming lyrics. Douglas remembers, &quot;Steven came back with the whole thing. He started with the chorus, &#x27;Walk this way,&#x27; and then he came up with the most off the wall verse, which was early rap, maybe the first rap ever. Be-bop-dooty-dot-dan-bot-bot boddy-da-doot-ba-bada-da-dow. I mean, where did it come from? Clark Terry, Count Basie, you know? Steven had those roots, mind you, because he had a big musical catalog, so he had a lot of that stuff upstairs, but that he went for that was amazing.&quot;

Perry thought the &quot;lyrics were so great,&quot; saying that Tyler, being a drummer, &quot;likes to use words as a percussion element. The words have to tell a story, but for Steven they also have to have a bouncy feel for flow. Then he searches for words that have a double entendre, which comes out of the blues tradition.&quot; Perry remembers, &quot;David Johansen from the Dolls called me. He said, &#x27;That&#x27;s the filthiest song I ever heard on the radio.&#x27; That was the other thing — Steven always wanted to put the double entendres in his stuff to see how close to the edge we could get, you know, without having to have stuff beeped out. Obviously, the whole song is so lascivious. It was a compliment to hear that from David, because the Dolls were no slouches when it came to that stuff.&quot;

==Recording==
At the beginning of 1975, the band started working at The Record Plant in New York City for the album that became &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;. The sessions for &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; were produced by Douglas without Colcordthe album was engineered by Jay Messina with assistant engineers Rod O&#x27;Brien, Corky Stasiak and Dave Thoener.

Once again, Douglas booked rehearsal space for the band to allow time for creativity and help them to develop material for the album before going into the studio. Tom Hamilton remembers, &quot;I just remember getting together with our producer, Jack Douglas, and we used to practice at this little sort of barn, that had been converted to a studio, about 20 miles outside of Boston. It was just a blast, we spent the days laughing and playing, goin&#x27; to movies and hangin&#x27; out at night.&quot; Engineer Jay Messina remembers, &quot;Jack would get quite involved musically with the band, and lots of times have cool musical ideas for them that they were very receptive to, but generally it was Steven and Joe that were the creative driving force.&quot; Douglas continues, &quot;We decided... to try a bunch of different things. Go in a whole bunch of different directions. The sass is there and the rock, but we wanted to try things like &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot; - bring in a little bit more sweetening, arrange a little bit more so it was less free playing; throw out a lot of stuff before we went into the studio. Also, that was the first album that we did together that was totally developed in the pre-production period. They had no songs - maybe one written before we started our pre-production. So that&#x27;s when our relationship got a little bit tighter. We started working together a lot in arranging and developing songs from day one.&quot;

The songs for &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; were recorded with a Spectrasonics mixing board and a 16-track tape recorder. Douglas explains, &quot;We didn&#x27;t think 16-tracks limited us. These guys could play live. It&#x27;s not like Joey went out and played the drums and then we laid them in, and then we laid something over that, and there was a click track and all that. They just went out and played, all of them together. Once you got a headphone mix for the band and they could hear each other, they just let it rip. It was, everybody hands-on, and we were recording to 16-track. If there was a space somewhere, like on a backing vocals track, if there was eight bars that were empty, and we needed it to put a tambourine on, we would stick it on that track for eight bars. We would actually cut the multi-track, put a leader in, and then record, we would record so that when it passed the leader, that&#x27;s where the backing vocal was would start, so we would take up every bit of space, and then if we had to continue the tambourine, we might go to another track that had some space. The track restrictions also forced you to go live to your EQ, your compression, your echo, as much as you could, to the track, as you were recording it.&quot; Perry continues, &quot;My clearest memories are when we would do mixes, and Steven and I were always in the studio, right from the very beginning, right til the end. We would be there right alongside Jack and engineer Jay Messina. This was before automation and when we were doing mixes, everybody had to be there, turn the pan buttons and change EQ. Bring in a tambourine, hand claps, maybe a background vocal, and a rhythm guitar, popping in and out on one track. Every time you ran a mix, it was a performance.&quot;

&quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; features a variety of unique instrumentation. During the intro, Tyler shakes a packet of sugar in place of maracas, as none were available. He also plays the Vibraslap, which broke the third time he hit it, which can still be heard in the final recording. The introduction builds with the use of a talk box by Perry. The song begins with a repeated electric bass riff tracked alongside the bass marimba, played by engineer Jay Messina. Douglas explains, &quot;The electric bass is doubled by a bass marimba, which is a marimba with tone bars that are so long on the low end that you have to get up on a ladder to play. Jay Messina, our engineer, also played vibes, and so I said to him, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you double the bass line with the marimba&#x27;, which is that old, wooden vibe. Boom-boom-boom da-boom-boom — it had this percussion and a tremendously low note. It actually went an octave below the electric bass, then you&#x27;d mix those two together, and that&#x27;s the bass sound on that song.&quot;

Jack Douglas brought in a symphony orchestra for &quot;You See Me Crying&quot;, which was conducted by Mike Mainieri. Production of the song took a long time to complete due to the many complex drum and guitar parts. The band&#x27;s label, Columbia Records, was nonetheless very impressed with the song and the recording process. Bruce Lundvall, then-president of Columbia Records, walked in on the recording sessions for &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; when the band was working on the song, and remarked: &quot;You guys got an incredible thing going here. I just came from a Herbie Hancock session and this is much more fun.&quot;

During the sessions, the group would record backing tracks as instrumentals together, and then record Tyler&#x27;s vocals and additional overdubs afterwards. Tom Hamilton explains, &quot;We would record the tracks, and Steven and Joe would stay because they were doing most of the overdubs, and the rest of us had to go home to save money. And back then, the lyrics weren&#x27;t written. So we knew what the tracks were going to sound like, but we wouldn&#x27;t really know what the songs were going to be like until we heard the whole thing.&quot; Perry always liked to wait until Tyler recorded his vocal so he &quot;could weave around his vocal attack,&quot; but Tyler wanted Perry to record first for the same reason. On &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, Tyler&#x27;s vocal was recorded first with Perry&#x27;s guitar track overdubbed.

Perry has stated that he wanted to call the LP &quot;Rocks&quot;, which would be used for their next studio album. Tyler explains the inspiration for the album&#x27;s title in his memoir: &quot;I came up with the title because of its obvious meanings and since people thought we were fucking crazy anyway, what did it matter? This was Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;...singular, sexy, and psychosensational. The other reason I came up with Toys in the Attic was that I knew we&#x27;d made it. It&#x27;s a statement of longevity. The record will be played long after you&#x27;re dead. Our records would be up there in the attic, too, with the things that you loved and never wanted to forget. And to me, Aerosmith was becoming that.&quot; Drummer Kramer continues, &quot;That&#x27;s when everything started to happen, as far as being able to look at the band and say, &#x27;Yeah, things are good now. The songs are good. The playing&#x27;s good.&#x27; And it was like, you know, there was no limit to what we could do.&quot; Tom Hamilton also remembers the production favorably: &quot;We really did put everything we had in &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;. I guess the reason it turned out so well was because we had the perfect combination of great songs and the kind of fired-up spirit that you get after a lot of touring. We were like a well oiled machine at that time and had lots of dynamite songs that we couldn&#x27;t wait to get down on tape. So no wonder the album came out sounding the way it did.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==

Contemporary reviews were mixed. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Gordon Fletcher compared the album unfavourably to &quot;Get Your Wings&quot;, which in his opinion, was &quot;testimony to the band&#x27;s raw abilities.&quot; He criticised Douglas&#x27;s production and wrote that, despite &quot;good moments,&quot; the band did not avoid &quot;instances of directionless meandering and downright weak material.&quot; Robert Christgau was more positive, and remarked on the progress Aerosmith had made in a short time, musically and lyrically. Greg Kot called the album a landmark of hard rock.

Opinions have become more positive over time. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine remarked how Aerosmith &quot;finally perfected their mix of Stonesy raunch and Zeppelin-esque riffing,&quot; thanks to &quot;an increased sense of songwriting skills and purpose,&quot; creating a new style that &quot;fully embraced sleaziness&quot; in Tyler&#x27;s lyrics, backed by &quot;an appropriately greasy&quot; music. In &quot;Blender&quot;, Ben Mitchell found &quot;Aerosmith firing on all coke-clogged cylinders.&quot; He lauded all the songs in the album and called the arrangement of &quot;You See Me Crying&quot; &quot;a typical ’70s rock extravagance.&quot;

After &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; was released in April 1975, it eventually peaked at No. 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, 63 positions higher than &quot;Get Your Wings&quot;. Released as a single, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; became a minor hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 reaching No.36 in 1975, and &quot;Walk This Way&quot; reached No.10 on the Hot 100 in 1977.

The album would gain renewed attention in 1986, 11 years after its release, when hip-hop group Run-DMC covered &quot;Walk This Way&quot; with Aerosmith. This helped revive the latter&#x27;s flagging career and helped propel rap rock to the mainstream.

<doc id="196058" wikidata="Q1929234" url="?curid=196058" title="Draw the Line (Aerosmith album)">
<text>Draw the Line is the fifth studio album by American hard rock band Aerosmith, released on December 9, 1977. It was recorded between June–October in an abandoned convent near New York City. The portrait of the band on the album cover was drawn by the celebrity caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.

==Background==
By 1977, Aerosmith had released four studio albums, the two most recent&quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rocks&quot; (1976)catapulting the band to stardom. However, as the band began recording its next album, &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, their excessive lifestyle, combined with constant touring and drug use, began to take its toll. &quot;&quot;Draw the Line&quot; was untogether because we weren&#x27;t a cohesive unit anymore,&quot; guitarist Joe Perry admitted in the Stephen Davis band memoir &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. &quot;We were drug addicts dabbling in music, rather than musicians dabbling in drugs.&quot;

Although the LP would sell well more than a million copies in fewer than six weeks after its release, in 2014 Perry would refer to it as &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; and &quot;the decay of our artistry.&quot;

==Writing==
Largely due to their drug consumption, both Tyler and Perry were not as involved in the writing and recording as they had been on previous albums. According to Perry: &quot;A lot of people had input into that record because Steven and I had stopped giving a fuck. &quot;Draw the Line,&quot; &quot;I Want To Know Why,&quot; and &quot;Get It Up&quot; were the only things Steven and I wrote together. Tom, Joey and Steven came up with &quot;Kings and Queens,&quot; and Brad played rhythm and lead. Brad and Steven wrote &quot;The Hand That Feeds,&quot; which I didn&#x27;t even play on because I&#x27;d stayed in bed the day they recorded it and Brad played great on it anyway.

For his part, Tyler has maintained that it was the band&#x27;s lethargy, not his, that slowed his progress, because &quot;I wasn&#x27;t Patti Smith writing poetry. I write exactly to the music, and when the music ain&#x27;t coming, neither were the lyrics.&quot; However, Tyler confessed to Alan di Perna of &quot;Guitar World&quot; in April 1997, &quot;What I specifically remember was not being present in the studio because I was so stoned. In the past, I always had to be there and hear every note that was going downwho was playing what and were they out of tune... I just didn&#x27;t care anymore.&quot;

In his autobiography &quot;Rocks&quot;, Perry admits that he had misplaced a cookie tin full of demos for the band that he had prepared in his basement studio, irritating Douglas, but they were eventually found by Perry&#x27;s wife Elyssa: &quot;Among those tapes was not only the fully realized &quot;Bright Light Fright,&quot; but tracks that led to other songs like &quot;I Want To Know Why,&quot; &quot;Get It Up&quot; and &quot;Draw the Line,&quot; the title tune. Something I&#x27;d started with David Johansen became &quot;Sight for Sore Eyes.&quot; But the lyrics literally took months for Steven to write, and by then we were back at the Record Plant in New York.&quot;

Of &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, Tyler later recalled, &quot;Joe had this lick on a six-string bass that was so definitive, the song just about wrote itself. It reached down my neck and grabbed the lyrics out of my throat.&quot; Tyler explains the meaning of the lyrics &quot;Carrie...was a wet-nap winner&quot;: &quot;Well, a wet-nap is something that you wipe babies&#x27; asses with. Back in the day, if you were lucky enough to grab a stewardess on a plane and you came out of the bathroom, all you had to clean up with was a wet-nap. The best lyrics are like the scrambled eggs you have in your head about a situation. And I&#x27;ve got this uncanny way of weaving shit together. To be honest, in everyday dealings, I&#x27;ll talk to people, and they go, &quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot;

Producer Jack Douglas wrote the lyrics to &quot;Critical Mass&quot; about a dream he had during the sessions. He explains, &quot;The lyrics to &quot;Critical Mass&quot; came from a dream I had at the Cenacle. I never expected Steven to record it, but he didn&#x27;t have anything else, so he used my lyrics as written.&quot;

&quot;Get It Up&quot; features Karen Lawrence, singer of the band L.A. Jets, on the chorus. David Krebs later stated that he felt Tyler&#x27;s lyrics on songs like &quot;Get It Up&quot; did not help the album&#x27;s standing among Aerosmith fans: &quot;The essence of Aerosmith had always been a positive and very macho sexuality, total unashamed, a little sleazy... They &quot;didn&#x27;t&quot; want to hear lyrics like &#x27;Get It Up,&#x27; which repeated over and over again, &quot;Can&#x27;t&quot; get it up&#x27;... The negative lyrics were a big problem.&quot;

Perry performs lead vocals on his solo composition &quot;Bright Light Fright&quot;, which was inspired by the Sex Pistols. He remembers a lukewarm reception when he presented the song to the band: They &quot;didn&#x27;t like it. I said, &#x27;Do you want to do it or not?&#x27; They said no.&quot;

Douglas difficulty completing &quot;Kings and Queens&quot;. He remembers, &quot;with &quot;Kings and Queens,&quot; Steven and I wrote the lyrics together, which was like pulling teeth. In his memoir, Tyler writes that the song&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by a &quot;medieval fantasy&quot; that featured &quot;a stoned-out rock star in his tattered satin rags lying on the ancient stone floor of a castle - slightly mad, but still capable of conjuring up a revolutionary album that would astound the ears of the ones who heard it and make the critics cringe.&quot; He continues in the &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; liner notes: &quot;This one was just about how many people died from holy wars because of their beliefs or non-beliefs. With that one, my brain was back with the knights of the round table...&quot; Drummer Joey Kramer remembers recording &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; at a &quot;typical session at the Cenacle. It was recorded in the chapel with the pews out, the drums on the altar. Jack was in the confessional, hitting the snare drum by himself.&quot; Jack Douglas plays the mandolin on the track.

&quot;Sight for Sore Eyes&quot; originated during the sessions for David Johansen&#x27;s first solo album. Joe Perry plays on two tracks on the solo debut by the New York Dolls singer.

The album concludes with an Elvis Presley cover, Kokomo Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot;. The group frequently played the song live earlier in the decade, with Perry on vocals.

==Recording==
Producer Jack Douglas, who had started producing the band with &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; in 1974, expressed similar feelings about the apathy that permeated the recording sessions: &quot;So I started &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, and for a while gave it my all. But because they were half-hearted about the record, I was too. Steven wasn&#x27;t writing at all.&quot; He continues, &quot;I was working on &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, which was approaching the end of Aerosmith&#x27;s inspiration. It was just too much road, not enough time to write, too much excess. Too much money! I mean when you&#x27;ve got two weeks off and you&#x27;re told to go write songs for your next album, and you&#x27;ve got all this money, you&#x27;re gonna want to go out and have some fun, not sit at home banging out notes and words. I had to go out on a world tour with Aerosmith, just to finish it. Everytime they were near a studio, I&#x27;d pull them in to finish up the record.&quot;

Between attempts at recording at the Wherehouse and additional sessions during their Summer 1977 tour of North America and Europe, the group moved into the Cenacle, a de-consecrated monastery in Westchester County, New York. According to Tyler&#x27;s autobiography, manager David Krebs suggested that the band record its next album at the estate near Armonk, New York &quot;away from the temptation of drugs.&quot; The plan failed miserably, however, with Tyler recalling, &quot;Drugs can be imported, David... we have our resources. Dealers deliver! Hiding us away in a three hundred room former convent was a prescription for total lunacy.&quot; Perry remembers the setting: &quot;The Cenacle included sixty acres, with a great big house, and the Record Plant installed a studio for us. I don&#x27;t know how much it cost us, but it was outrageous. They had a bar and people serving us... I&#x27;d wake up at four or five in the afternoon and say &#x27;one Black Russian please&#x27;. We had motorcycles and Porsches and we&#x27;d go cruising around the countryside terrorizing everybody. We had a great time up there...&quot; In the VH1 &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode on the group, Douglas states, &quot;People were shooting, bullets were flying. It was insane. People, drugs and guns. You know, they don&#x27;t go together,&quot; with drummer Joey Kramer adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if we did any of those sessions, or made any of that record, straight.&quot;

==Album cover and title==
Artist Al Hirschfeld visited the group during the sessions at the Cenacle to draw the iconic album cover. Tyler remembers, &quot;The cartoonist Al Hirschfeld came up while we were there and drew the caricature of the group that&#x27;s on the cover of &quot;Draw the Line&quot;. He really nailed us. We look like freakish botanical specimens pinned under glass. Draw the Line—it was the perfect title for the way we were living. I always went too far and was often reminded that I never knew where to draw the line. I hated to hear that, but that&#x27;s
how it was. Say &#x27;Don&#x27;t do it,&#x27; and we would do it. &#x27;Cause I knew that if you don&#x27;t know where to draw the line, then your choices become infinite.&quot; Douglas continues, &quot;&quot;Draw The Line&quot; is a classic title that says it all, the coke lines, heroin lines, drawing symbolic lines and crossing them all – no matter what.&quot;

==Reception==

Contemporary reviews were mixed. Billy Altman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the LP &quot;a truly horrendous record, chaotic to the point of malfunction and with an almost impenetrably dense sound adding to the confusion.&quot; Robert Christgau considered the album the product of a band &quot;out of gas&quot;. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; opined that &quot;&#x27;Critical Mass&#x27; and &#x27;Get It Up&#x27; are both bright numbers with solid rhythms while &#x27;Draw the Line&#x27; and &#x27;I Wanna Know Why&#x27; didn&#x27;t deserve preservation.&quot;

Retrospective reviews are more positive. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at No. 37 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot; for its &quot;high energy&quot;, although it never touches heavy metal as a genre, concluding with the comment &quot;sleaze was never so classy.&quot; According to Greg Prato of AllMusic, &quot;the band shies away from studio experimenting and dabbling in different styles,&quot; returning &quot;to simple, straight-ahead hard rock&quot; and releasing &quot;the last true studio album from Aerosmith&#x27;s original lineup for nearly a decade.&quot; Another AllMusic reviewer stated that, &quot;although some fans see &quot;Draw the Line&quot; as the beginning of a decline for Aerosmith, it still offers up some strong hard-rock tunes. One of its best moments is the title track, one of the group&#x27;s most relentless rockers.&quot; In a review for Ultimate Classic Rock, Sterling Whitaker cited &quot;Get It Up&quot; as an example of a track that &quot;should-have-been-great-but-not-quite,&quot; saying that it &quot;featured important elements of the classic Aerosmith sound, but somehow didn&#x27;t catch fire.&quot; Martin Popoff defined &quot;Draw the Line&quot; &quot;complicated, murky and layered&quot;, coming across as &quot;the serious, distressed Aerosmith album&quot;. He also wrote that despite &quot;being ambiguously dense, uncommunicative and busy&quot;, the album showed the band reaching &quot;new levels of musical maturity.&quot;

&quot;Draw the Line&quot; went platinum its first month of release, entering the music charts on December 24, 1977, peaking at No. 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and eventually being certified 2× platinum nearly a decade later. Even so, it marks the band&#x27;s first slowdown in album sales of their 1970s era, after their initial rise with the albums &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot;.

<doc id="196063" wikidata="Q271712" url="?curid=196063" title="Ida Tarbell">
<text>Ida Minerva Tarbell (November 5, 1857January 6, 1944) was an American writer, investigative journalist, biographer, and lecturer. She was one of the leading muckrakers and reformers of the Progressive Era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was a pioneer of investigative journalism.

Born in Pennsylvania at the beginning of the oil boom, Tarbell is best known for her 1904 book &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company.&quot; The book was first published as a series of articles in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; from 1902 to 1904. It has been called a &quot;masterpiece of investigative journalism&quot;, by historian J. North Conway, as well as &quot;the single most influential book on business ever published in the United States&quot; by historian Daniel Yergin. The work contributed to the dissolution of the Standard Oil monopoly and helped usher in the Hepburn Act of 1906, the Mann-Elkins Act, the creation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914.

Tarbell also wrote several biographies over the course of her 64-year career. She wrote biographies on Madame Roland and Napoleon. Tarbell believed that &quot;the Truth and motivations of powerful human beings could be discovered.&quot; That Truth, she became convinced, could be conveyed in such a way as &quot;to precipitate meaningful social change.&quot; She wrote numerous books and works on Abraham Lincoln, including ones that focused on his early life and career. After her exposé on Standard Oil and character study of John D. Rockefeller, she wrote biographies of businessmen Elbert Henry Gary, chairman of U.S. Steel, and Owen D. Young, president of General Electric.

A prolific writer and lecturer, Tarbell was known for taking complex subjects — such as the oil industry, tariffs, labor practices — and breaking them down into informative and easily understood articles. Her articles drove circulation at &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The American Magazine&quot; and many of her books were popular with the general American public. After a successful career as both writer and editor for &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Tarbell left with several other editors to buy and publish &quot;The American Magazine&quot;. Tarbell also traveled to all of the then 48 states on the lecture circuit and spoke on subjects including the evils of war, world peace, American politics, trusts, tariffs, labor practices, and women&#x27;s issues.

Tarbell took part in professional organizations and served on two Presidential committees. She helped form the Authors’ League (now the Author&#x27;s Guild) and was President of the Pen and Brush Club for 30 years. During World War I, she served on President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Committee on the Council of National Defense. After the war, Tarbell served on President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s 1921 Unemployment Conference.

Tarbell, who never married, is often considered a feminist by her actions, although she was critical of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

==Early life and education==
Tarbell was born on a farm in Erie County, Pennsylvania, on November 5, 1857, to Esther Ann (née McCullough), a teacher, and Franklin Summer Tarbell, a teacher and a joiner and later an oilman. She was born in the log cabin home of her maternal grandfather, Walter Raleigh McCullough, a Scots-Irish pioneer, and his wife. Her father&#x27;s distant immigrant ancestors had settled in New England in the 17th century. Tarbell was told by her grandmother that they were descended from Sir Walter Raleigh, a member of George Washington&#x27;s staff, and also the first American Episcopalian bishop. Tarbell had three younger siblings: Walter, Franklin, Jr., and Sarah. Franklin, Jr. died of scarlet fever at a young age and Sarah, also afflicted, would remain physically weakened throughout her life. Walter became an oilman like his father, while Sarah was an artist.
Ida Tarbell&#x27;s early life in the oil fields of Pennsylvania would have an impact when she later wrote on the Standard Oil Company and on labor practices. The Panic of 1857 hit the Tarbell family hard as banks collapsed and the Tarbells lost their savings. Franklin Tarbell was away in Iowa building a family homestead when Ida was born. Franklin had to abandon the Iowan house and return to Pennsylvania. With no money, he walked across the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio to return, and supported himself along the way by teaching in rural schools. When he returned, ragged from his 18-month journey, young Ida Tarbell was said to have told him, &quot;Go away, bad man!&quot;

The Tarbells&#x27; fortune would turn as the Pennsylvania oil rush began in 1859. They lived in the western region of Pennsylvania as new oil fields were being developed, utterly changing the regional economy. Oil, she would write in her autobiography, opened “a rich field for tricksters, swindlers, exploiters of vice in every known form.” Tarbell&#x27;s father first used his trade to build wooden oil storage tanks. The family lived in a shack with a workshop for Franklin in an oil field with twenty-five oil wells. Oil was everywhere in the sand, pits, and puddles. Tarbell wrote of the experience, &quot;No industry of man in its early days has ever been more destructive of beauty, order, decency, than the production of petroleum.&quot;

In 1860, Ida&#x27;s father moved the family to Rouseville, Pennsylvania. Accidents that occurred in Rouseville impacted Ida Tarbell deeply. Town founder and neighbor Henry Rouse was drilling for oil when a flame hit natural gas coming from a pump. Rouse survived a few hours, which gave him just enough time to write his will and leave his million-dollar estate to the other settlers to build roads. In total, 18 men were killed, and the Tarbells&#x27; mother, Esther, cared for one of the burn victims in their home. In another incident, three women died in a kitchen explosion. Tarbell was not allowed to see the bodies, but she snuck into the room where the women awaited burial. Tarbell suffered from nightmares for the rest of her life.

After the Rouseville boom was finished in 1869, the family moved to Titusville, Pennsylvania. Tarbell&#x27;s father built a family house at 324 Main Street using lumber and fixtures from the defunct Bonta Hotel in Pithole, Pennsylvania.

Tarbell&#x27;s father later became an oil producer and refiner in Venango County. Franklin&#x27;s business, along with those of many other small businessmen, was adversely affected by the South Improvement Company scheme (circa 1872) between the railroads and more substantial oil interests where in less than four months during what was later known as &quot;The Cleveland Conquest&quot; or &quot;The Cleveland Massacre,&quot; Standard Oil absorbed 22 of its 26 Cleveland competitors. Later, Tarbell would vividly recall this event in her writing, in which she accused the leaders of the Standard Oil Company of using unfair tactics to put her father and many small oil companies out of business. The South Improvement Company secretly worked with the railroads to raise the rates on oil shipment for independent oil men. The members of South Improvement Company received discounts and rebates to offset the rates and put the independents out of business. Franklin Tarbell participated against the South Improvement Company through marches and tipping over Standard Oil railroad tankers. The government of Pennsylvania eventually moved to disband the South Improvement Company.

The Tarbells were socially active, entertaining prohibitionists and women&#x27;s suffragists. Her family subscribed to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, and &quot;the New York Tribune&quot; and it was there that Ida Tarbell followed the events of the Civil War. Tarbell would also sneak into the family worker&#x27;s bunkhouse to read copies of &quot;the Police Gazette&quot;—a gruesome tabloid. Her family was Methodist and attended church twice a week. Esther Tarbell supported women&#x27;s rights and entertained women such as Mary Livermore and Frances E. Willard.
Ida Tarbell was intelligent—but also undisciplined in the classroom. According to reports by Tarbell herself, she paid little attention in class and was often truant until one teacher set her straight: &quot;She told me the plain and ugly truth about myself that day, and as I sat there, looking her straight in the face, too proud to show any feeling, but shamed as I never had been before and never have been since.&quot; Tarbell was especially interested in the sciences, and she began comparing the landscape around her in Pennsylvania to what she was learning in school. &quot;Here I was suddenly on a ground which meant something to me. From childhood, plants, insects, stones were what I saw when I went abroad, what I brought home to press, to put into bottles, to litter up the house... I had never realized that they were subjects for study... School suddenly became exciting.&quot;

Tarbell graduated at the head of her high school class in Titusville and went on to study biology at Allegheny College in 1876, where she was the only woman in her class of 41. Tarbell had an interest in evolutionary biology—at her childhood home she spent many hours with a microscope—and said of her interest in science, &quot;The quest for the truth had been born in me... the most essential of man&#x27;s quests.&quot; One of Tarbell&#x27;s professors, Jeremiah Tingley, allowed her to use the college&#x27;s microscope for study and Tarbell used it to study the Common Mudpuppy, a foot-long amphibian that used both gills and a lung and thought to be a missing link.

Tarbell displayed leadership at Allegheny. She was a founding member of the local sorority that became the Mu chapter of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority in 1876. Tarbell also led the charge to place a sophomore stone on campus dedicated to learning and with the Latin phrase, &quot;Spes sibi quisque&quot;, which translates to &quot;Everyone is his/her own hope&quot;. She was a member of the campus women&#x27;s literary society, the Ossoli Society, named after writer Margaret Fuller Ossoli, and wrote for the society&#x27;s publication, &quot;the Mosaic&quot;.

Tarbell graduated in 1880 with an A.B. degree and an M.A. degree in 1883. Tarbell later supported the university by serving on the board of trustees, to which she was first elected in 1912. She was the second woman to serve as a trustee and held the post for more than three decades.

==Early career==
Tarbell left school seeking to contribute to society but unsure of how to do so, she became a teacher. Tarbell began her career as headmistress at Poland Union Seminary in Poland, Ohio in August 1880. The school was both a high school and provided continuing education courses for local teachers. Tarbell taught classes in geology, botany, geometry, and trigonometry as well as languages: Greek, Latin, French, and German. After two years, she realized teaching was too much for her, and she returned home. She was exhausted by the workload and exasperated by the low wages which meant she had to borrow money from her parents.

Tarbell returned to Pennsylvania, where she met Theodore L. Flood, editor of &quot;The Chautauquan&quot;, a teaching supplement for home study courses at Chautauqua, New York. Tarbell&#x27;s family was familiar with the movement which encouraged adult education and self-study. She was quick to accept Flood&#x27;s offer to write for the publication. Initially, Tarbell worked two weeks at the Meadville, Pennsylvania headquarters and worked two weeks at home. This allowed her to continue her own study at home in biology using microscopes. She became managing editor in 1886, and her duties included proofreading, answering reader questions, providing proper pronunciation of certain words, translating foreign phrases, identifying characters, and defining words.

Tarbell began writing brief items for the magazine before working up to longer features as she established her writing style and voice. Her first article was &#x27;The Arts and Industries of Cincinnati&#x27; and appeared in December 1886. According to Steve Weinberg in &quot;Taking on the Trust&quot;, this was when Tarbell established a style that would carry throughout her career: &quot;Tarbell would imbue her articles, essays, and books with moral content, grounded in her unwavering rectitude. That rectitude, while sometimes suggesting inflexibility, drove her instincts for reform, a vital element in her future confrontation with Rockefeller.&quot;

Tarbell wrote two articles that showcased her conflicting views on the roles of women that would follow her through her life. Tarbell&#x27;s article, &quot;Women as Inventors,&quot; was published in the March 1887 issue of &quot;The Chautauquan.&quot; When an article written by Mary Lowe Dickinson claimed the number of women patent owners to be about 300—and that women would never become successful inventors—Tarbell&#x27;s curiosity was sparked and she began her own investigation. Tarbell traveled to the Patent Office in Washington, D.C., and met with the head of the department, R. C. McGill. McGill had put together a list of close to 2,000 women. Tarbell wrote in the article, &quot;Three things worth knowing and believing: that women have invented a large number of useful articles; that these patents are not confined to &#x27;clothes and kitchen&#x27; devices as the skeptical masculine mind avers; that invention is a field in which woman has large possibilities.&quot; Tarbell later followed this article up with a showcase on women in journalism in April 1887. The article contained history, journalism practices, and advice including a warning that journalism was an open field for women, and yet women should refrain from shedding tears easily and appearing weak.

Tarbell balked at being a &quot;hired gal&quot; and decided to strike out on her own after a falling out with Theodore Flood. Tarbell decided to follow her father&#x27;s philosophy that it was better to work for oneself than to be a hired hand. She began researching women from history including Germaine de Staël and Madame Roland for inspiration and as subject matter for her writing. The real reason for the fall-out with Flood remains a mystery, but one reason may have been the placement of his son&#x27;s name on the Masthead above Tarbell&#x27;s own. Another hinted that her family had reason to seek revenge on him.

== Paris in the 1890s ==
Leaving the security of &quot;The Chautauquan&quot;, Tarbell moved to Paris in 1891 at age 34 to live and work. She shared an apartment on the Rue du Sommerard with three women friends from &quot;The Chautauquan&quot;. The apartment was within a few blocks of the Panthéon, Notre-Dame de Paris, and the Sorbonne. This was an exciting time in Paris. The Eiffel Tower had been finished recently in 1889, and Tarbell and her friends enjoyed the art produced by Impressionists including Degas, Monet, Manet, and Van Gogh. Tarbell described the color of the art as &quot;the blues and greens fairly howl they are so bright and intense.&quot; Tarbell attended the Can-can at the Moulin Rouge and in a letter to her family she advised them to read Mark Twain&#x27;s description of it in &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot; as she didn&#x27;t like to write about it.

Tarbell had an active social life in Paris. She and her flatmates hosted a language salon where both English and French speakers could come together and practice their non-native language skills. Her landlady, Madame Bonnet, held weekly dinners for the women and her other tenants. These tenants included young men from Egypt, and among them was Prince Said Toussoum, a cousin of the Egyptian ruler. Tarbell met and had a possible romance with Charles Downer Hazen, a future French historian and professor at Smith College. 

Tarbell set about making her career as a writer in Paris. She supported herself by writing for several American newspapers including the &quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot;, the &quot;Cincinnati Times-Star&quot;, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Tarbell published the short story, &quot;France Adorée,&quot; in the December 1891 issue of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Magazine&quot;. All of this work, along with a tutorship, helped Tarbell as she worked on her first biography, a book on Madame Roland: the leader of an influential &quot;salon&quot; during the French Revolution. Tarbell already wanted to rescue women from the obscurity of history. Her research led her to an introduction to Leon Marillier, a descendant of Roland who provided access to Roland&#x27;s letters and family papers. Marillier invited Tarbell to visit the Roland Country estate, Le Clos.

Tarbell continued her education in Paris and also learned investigative and research techniques used by French historians. Tarbell attended lectures at the Sorbonne—including those on the history of the French Revolution, 18th-century literature, and period painting. She learned from French historians how to present evidence in a clear, compelling style.

What Tarbell discovered about Madame Roland changed her own worldview. She began the biography with admiration for Roland but grew disillusioned as she researched and learned more. Tarbell determined that Roland, who followed her husband&#x27;s lead, was not the independent thinker she had imagined and was complicit in creating an atmosphere where violence led to the Terror and her own execution. She wrote of Roland, &quot;This woman had been one of the steadiest influences to violence, willing, even eager, to use this terrible revolutionary force, so bewildering and terrifying to me, to accomplish her ends, childishly believing herself and her friends strong enough to control it when they needed it no longer. The heaviest blow to my self-confidence so far was my loss of faith in revolution as a divine weapon. Not since I discovered the world not to have been made in six days...had I been so intellectually and spiritually upset.&quot;

It was during this time that Tarbell received bad news and then a shock. Franklin Tarbell&#x27;s business partner had committed suicide, leaving Franklin in debt. Subsequently, a July 1892 newspaper announced that Tarbell&#x27;s hometown of Titusville had been completely destroyed by flood and fire. Over 150 people died, and she feared her family was among them. Oil Creek had flooded and inflammable material on the water had ignited and exploded. Tarbell was relieved when she received a one-word cablegram that read: &quot;Safe!&quot; Her family and their home had been spared.
== &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; ==

Tarbell had published articles with the syndicate run by publisher Samuel McClure, and McClure had read a Tarbell article called &quot;The Paving of the Streets of Paris by Monsieur Alphand&quot;, which described how the French carried out large public works. Impressed, McClure told his partner John S. Philips, &quot;This girl can write. We need to get her to do some work for our magazine&quot;. The magazine he was referring to was &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a new venture that he and Philips were intending to launch to appeal to the average middle-class reader. Convinced that Tarbell was just the kind of writer that he wanted to work for him, he showed up at Tarbell&#x27;s door in Paris while on a scheduled visit to France in 1892 to offer her the editor position at the new magazine.

Tarbell described McClure as a &quot;will-of-the-wisp&quot;. He overstayed his visit, missed his train, and had to borrow $40 from Tarbell to travel on to Geneva. Tarbell assumed she would never see the money, which was for her vacation, again but his offices wired over the money the next day. Tarbell initially turned him down so she could continue working on the Roland biography but McClure was determined. Next, the art director for &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, August Jaccaci, made a visit to Tarbell to show her the maiden issue of the magazine.

Instead of taking up the editor position at &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, Tarbell began writing freelance articles for the magazine. She wrote articles about women intellectuals and writers in Paris as well as scientists. She hoped articles such as &quot;A Paris Press Woman&quot; for the &quot;Boston Transcript&quot; in 1893 would provide a blueprint for women journalists and writers. She interviewed Louis Pasteur for an 1893 article, visiting with Pasteur and going through his family photographs for the magazine. She returned to Pasteur again to find out his views on the future. This piece turned into a regular report on &quot;The Edge of the Future.&quot; Others interviewed for the report included Émile Zola, Alphonse Daudet, and Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;. Tarbell took on the role of the magazine&#x27;s Paris representative. Tarbell was then offered the position of youth editor to replace Frances Hodgson Burnett. When her biography of Madame Roland was finished, Tarbell returned home and joined the staff of &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; for a salary of $3,000 a year.

=== Napoleon Bonaparte ===
Tarbell returned from Paris in the summer of 1894, and, after a visit with family in Titusville, moved to New York City. In June of that year, Samuel McClure contacted her in order to commission a biographical series on French leader Napoleon Bonaparte. McClure had heard that &quot;the Century Magazine&quot;, &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; rival, was working on a series of articles about Bonaparte. Tarbell stayed at Twin Oaks in Washington, D.C., the home of Gardiner Green Hubbard, while working on the series. Tarbell made use of Hubbard&#x27;s extensive collection of Napoleon material and memorabilia as well as resources at the Library of Congress and the U.S. State Department. Tarbell&#x27;s schedule for the book was tight—the first installment came out only six weeks after she initially started her work. Tarbell called this &quot;biography on a gallop.&quot;

The series proved to be a training ground for Tarbell&#x27;s style and methodology for biographies. Tarbell believed in the Great man theory of biography and that extraordinary individuals could shape their society at least as much as society shaped them. While working on the series, Tarbell was introduced to historian and educator Herbert B. Adams of Johns Hopkins University. Adams believed in the &quot;objective interpretation of primary sources&quot; which would also become Tarbell&#x27;s method for writing about her subjects. Adams also taught at Smith College and was a proponent for women&#x27;s education.

This series of articles would solidify Tarbell&#x27;s reputation as a writer, opening up new avenues for her. The Napoleon series proved popular and doubled circulation up to over 100,000 on &quot;McClure&quot;&#x27;s magazine—quadrupling the readership by the final seventh Napoleon installment. It included illustrations from the Gardiner Green Hubbard collection. The articles were folded into a book that would be a best seller and earn Tarbell royalties for the rest of her life—over 70,000 copies were made of the first edition. Tarbell said that her sketch of Napoleon turned her plans &quot;topsy-turvy.&quot; Because of its popularity, Tarbell was also finally able to find a publisher—Scribner&#x27;s—for her Madame Roland book.

=== Abraham Lincoln ===
Another &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; story meant to compete against &quot;Century Magazine&quot; was on US president Abraham Lincoln, on whom &quot;Century&quot; had published a series by his private secretaries, John Nicolay and John Hay. At first, Tarbell was reluctant to take up work on Lincoln as she later said, &quot;If you once get into American history, I told myself, you know well enough that will finish France.&quot; At the same time, however, Tarbell had been fascinated with Lincoln since she was a young girl. She remembered the news of his assassination and her parents&#x27; reaction to it: her father coming home from his shop, her mother burying her &quot;face in her apron, running into her room sobbing as if her heart would break.&quot;

When Tarbell first approached John Nicolay, he told her that he and Hay had written &quot;all that was worth telling of Lincoln&quot;. Tarbell decided to begin with Lincoln&#x27;s origins and his humble beginnings. Tarbell traveled the country meeting with and interviewing people who had known Lincoln—including his son Robert Todd Lincoln. Robert Lincoln shared with Tarbell an early and previously unpublished daguerreotype of Lincoln as a younger man. She followed up on a lost 1856 speech by Lincoln by tracking down Henry Clay Whitney—who claimed to have written down notes—and then confirming his notes via other witnesses. Whitney&#x27;s version of the speech was published in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, but has since been disproved by other historians.

Tarbell&#x27;s research in the backwoods of Kentucky and Illinois uncovered the true story of Lincoln&#x27;s childhood and youth. She wrote to and interviewed hundreds of people who knew or had contact with Lincoln. She tracked down leads and then confirmed their sources. She sent hundreds of letters looking for images of Lincoln and found evidence of more than three hundred previously unpublished Lincoln letters and speeches. Tarbell met with John H. Finley while visiting Knox College where Lincoln famously debated Stephen Douglas in 1858. Finley was the young college President, and he would go on to contribute to Tarbell&#x27;s work on Standard Oil and rise to become the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Tarbell traveled abroad to Europe, discovering that a rumor that Lincoln had appealed to Queen Victoria to not recognize the Confederacy was, in fact, false.

By December 1895, the popular series by Tarbell once again helped boost &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; circulation to over 250,000 which climbed to over 300,000, by 1900, making it higher than its rivals. This occurred even as the editors at &quot;Century&#x27;s Magazine&quot; sneered, &quot;They got a girl to write the Life of Lincoln.&quot; McClure would go on to use the money generated by Tarbell&#x27;s articles to buy a printing plant and a bindery.

It was at this time that Tarbell decided to be a writer and not an editor. The articles were collected in a book, giving Tarbell a national reputation as a major writer and the leading authority on the slain president. Tarbell published five books about Lincoln and traveled on the lecture circuit, recounting her discoveries to large audiences.

The tight writing schedules and frequent travel eventually impacted Tarbell&#x27;s health. On the verge of physical collapse, she checked into the Clifton Springs Sanitarium near Rochester, New York in 1896. Besides rest and relaxation, her treatment included taking the water cure. She would visit the Sanitarium numerous times over the next thirty years.

=== Editorship===
Tarbell continued to write profiles for McClure in the late 1890s. While there, she had the opportunity to observe the United States expansion into imperialism through the Spanish–American War. She was writing a series on military affairs, and in 1898 she was set to interview Nelson A. Miles, the commanding general of the United States, when the battleship the USS &quot;Maine&quot; was blown up in Havana Harbor. Tarbell was allowed to keep her appointment nonetheless and observe the response at the U.S. Army Headquarters. Theodore Roosevelt was already organizing what would become the Rough Riders, and Tarbell said that he kept bursting into the Army office, &quot;like a boy on roller skates.&quot; Tarbell longed for her old life in Paris, but realized she was needed in America: &quot;Between Lincoln and the Spanish–American War [as it became known] I realized I was taking on a citizenship I had practically resigned&quot;.

Tarbell moved to New York and accepted a position as desk editor for &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; in 1899. She was paid $5,000 a year and given shares in the company, which made her a part-owner. She rented an apartment in Greenwich Village which reminded her of France. She frequented the Hotel Brevoort, where Samuel Clemens (Mark Twain) also dined.

Her position as editor was to fill in for Samuel McClure, as he was planning to be away from the office for several months. Tarbell was to become known as an anchor in the office while the magazine built out its roster of investigative editors and authors. She and Phillips were described as the &quot;control&quot; to S. S. McClure&#x27;s &quot;motor.&quot; &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; sent Stephen Crane to cover Cuba during the War. Ray Stannard Baker was hired by the magazine to report on the Pullman Strike. Fiction editor Violo Roseboro discovered writers such as O. Henry, Jack London, and Willa Cather. John Huston Finley quit his job as president of Knox College and became an editor for &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;.

== Standard Oil ==
By the turn of the twentieth century &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; began an effort to &quot;expose the ills of American society.&quot; Having recently published a series on crime in America and looking for another big topic to cover, Tarbell and the other editors at &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; decided to look into the growth of trusts: steel and sugar were both considered before they settled on oil. There were a number of reasons why the magazine decided to publish a story on Standard Oil: in particular, Tarbell&#x27;s own first-hand experience with life in the Pennsylvania oil fields and the fact that Standard Oil was a trust represented by only one person, Rockefeller, and therefore might make the story easier to follow. Tarbell traveled to Europe and met with S. S. McClure to get his buy-in for the idea. McClure had been resting from exhaustion, but Tarbell&#x27;s article idea spurred him into action. They discussed the idea over many days at a spa in Milan. McClure felt that Tarbell should use the same biographical sketch format she used for Napoleon.

On her return to the states, Tarbell handed over the desk editor role to Lincoln Steffens in 1901, and began a meticulous investigation with the help of an assistant (John Siddall) into how the industry began, Rockefeller&#x27;s early interest in oil, and the Standard Oil trust. 
Tarbell&#x27;s father expressed concern to her about writing about Standard Oil, warning her that Rockefeller would stop at nothing and would ruin the magazine. One of Rockefeller&#x27;s banks did indeed threaten the magazine&#x27;s financial status to which Tarbell shocked the bank executive by replying, &quot;Of course that makes no difference to me&quot;.
Tarbell developed investigative reporting techniques, delving into private archives and public documents across the country. The documentation and oral interviews she gathered proved Standard Oil had used strong-arm tactics and manipulated competitors, railroad companies and others to reach its corporate goals. Organized by Tarbell into a cogent history, they became a &quot;damning portrayal of big business&quot; and a personal &quot;account of petty persecution&quot; by Rockfeller. A subhead on the cover of Weinberg&#x27;s book encapsulates it this way: &quot;How a female investigative journalist brought down the world&#x27;s greatest tycoon and broke up the Standard Oil monopoly&quot;.

Tarbell was able to find one critical piece of information that had gone missing—a book called &quot;the Rise and Fall of the South Improvement Company&quot; which had been published in 1873. Standard Oil and Rockefeller had its roots in the South Improvement Company&#x27;s illegal schemes. Standard Oil had attempted to destroy all available copies of the book, but Tarbell was finally able to locate one copy in the New York Public Library.

Another break in the story came from within Standard Oil itself and proved that the company was still using illegal and shady practices. An office boy working at the Standard Oil headquarters was given the job of destroying records which included evidence that railroads were giving the company advance information about refiner&#x27;s shipments. This allowed them to undercut the refiners. The young man happened to notice his Sunday school teacher&#x27;s name on several documents. The teacher was a refiner, and the young man took the papers to his teacher who passed them along to Tarbell in 1904. The series and book on Standard Oil brought Tarbell fame. The book was adapted into a play in 1905 called &quot;The Lion and the Mouse&quot;. The play was a hit even though Ida had turned down the lead role and an offer of $2,500 in salary per week for the twenty-week run. 
Samuel Clemens (author Mark Twain) introduced Tarbell to Henry H. Rogers, vice-president at Standard Oil and considered to be the third man after John D. Rockefeller and his brother William Rockefeller. Rogers had begun his career during the American Civil War in western Pennsylvania oil regions where Tarbell had grown up. Rockefeller had bought out Rogers and his partner, but then Rogers joined the trust. In early 1902 she conducted numerous detailed interviews with Rogers at Standard Oil&#x27;s headquarters. Rogers, wily and normally guarded in matters related to business and finance, may have been under the impression her work was to be complimentary and was apparently unusually forthcoming. Even after the first articles began to appear in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, Rogers continued to speak with Tarbell, much to her surprise.
Her investigative journalism on Standard Oil was serialized in nineteen articles that ran from November 1902 to 1904 in &quot;McClure&#x27;s;&quot; her first article being published with pieces by Lincoln Steffens and Ray Stannard Baker. Together these ushered in the era of muckraking journalism.

Tarbell&#x27;s biggest obstacle, however, was neither her gender nor Rockefeller&#x27;s opposition. Rather, her biggest obstacle was the craft of journalism as practiced at the turn of the twentieth century. She investigated Standard Oil and Rockefeller by using documents— hundreds of thousands of pages scattered throughout the nation—and then amplified her findings through interviews with the corporation&#x27;s executives and competitors, government regulators, and academic experts past and present. In other words, she proposed to practice what today is considered investigative reporting, which did not exist in 1900. Indeed, she invented a new form of journalism.

Magazine historian Frank Luther Mott called it, &quot;one of the greatest serials ever to appear in an American magazine.&quot; It would contribute to the dissolution of Standard Oil as a monopoly and lead to the Clayton Antitrust Act. 
Tarbell concluded the series with a two-part character study of Rockefeller, perhaps the first CEO profile ever, though she never met or even talked to him. Rockefeller called Tarbell, &quot;Miss Tarbarrel&quot;.
The first book-length investigation of Standard Oil had appeared in 1894 by newspaperman Henry Demarest Lloyd. However, this book, &quot;Wealth Against Commonwealth&quot;, contained factual errors and appeared to be too accusatory in nature to garner popular acclaim. However Tarbell&#x27;s articles when collected in the book, &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company&quot; (1904). became a bestseller, which was called a &quot;masterpiece of investigative journalism&quot; by author and historian J. North Conway. Her articles and the book would lead to the passage of the Hepburn Act in 1906 to oversee the railroads, the 1910 Mann-Elkins Act which gave the Interstate Commerce Commission power over oil rates, and the creation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1914.

President Theodore Roosevelt gave Tarbell and her peers including Lincoln Steffens and Ray Stannard Baker the label, &quot;muckrakers.&quot; Tarbell&#x27;s exposé of Standard Oil first appeared in the January 1903 issue of &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; along with Steffens&#x27; investigation of political corruption in Minneapolis and Baker&#x27;s exposé on labor union practices. The term muckraker came from John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; describing a Man with a Muckrake forever clearing muck from the floor. Roosevelt said of the muckrakers, &quot;The man who never does anything else, who never thinks or speaks or writes save of his feats with the muckrake, speedily becomes, not a help to society, not an incitement to good, but one of the most potent forces of evil&quot;. Tarbell disliked the muckraker label and wrote an article, &quot;Muckraker or Historian,&quot; in which she justified her efforts for exposing the oil trust. She referred to &quot;this classification of muckraker, which I did not like. All the radical element, and I numbered many friends among them, were begging me to join their movements. I soon found that most of them wanted attacks. They had little interest in balanced findings. Now I was convinced that in the long run the public they were trying to stir would weary of vituperation, that if you were to secure permanent results the mind must be convinced.&quot;

== &quot;The American Magazine&quot; ==
Tarbell had written for &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; from 1894 until 1906. By then, S. S. McClure had become an increasingly absentee publisher, occasionally dropping in to override ideas and Tarbell&#x27;s orders. She had lost her father the previous year to gastric cancer and S. S. McClure&#x27;s erratic behavior at the magazine contributed to her stress, as it threatened the stability of the magazine and Tarbell&#x27;s holdings. This led Tarbell and John Phillips to both resign from &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; in June 1906, followed by Baker, Steffens, and Siddall. Tarbell and Philips raised money to form the Phillips Publishing Company and to purchase &quot;The American Illustrated Magazine,&quot; (formerly &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;), which they renamed &quot;The American Magazine&quot;. Phillips became president. Tarbell became its associate editor and remained there until 1915. Instead of focusing on muckraking journalism, the magazine steered away from reporting what was &quot;wrong&quot; in society and focused on what was &quot;right.&quot; 
As well as the establishing the new magazine in 1906 Tarbell moved to Connecticut and purchased a 40-acre farm in Redding Ridge, Connecticut which she named Twin Oaks. After Tarbell bought her farm in 1906, her household expanded to include a number of family members. Tarbell resided with her sister Sarah in Easton, Connecticut, at Rock House and Valley Roads. Over the years, several other family members also lived on the property, including her niece and nephew, Clara and Tristram Tripper, who lived in a cottage. Tarbell&#x27;s brother Walter and his wife also came to live there after Walter suffered an emotional breakdown.

Mark Twain and other New York publishing people lived nearby and Tarbell frequently entertained friends there. Tarbell wrote of the work required on a farm: &quot;Things happened: the roof leaked; the grass must be cut if I was to have a comfortable sward to sit on; water in the house was imperative. And what I had not reckoned with came from all the corners of my land: incessant calls—fields calling to be rid of underbrush and weeds and turned to their proper work; a garden spot calling for a chance to show what it could do; apple trees begging to be trimmed and sprayed. I had bought an abandoned farm, and it cried loud to go about its business.&quot;

Tarbell wrote a series of essential articles at &quot;The American Magazine&quot;, in which she investigated tariffs and their impact on American businesses and consumers. Tarbell also traveled to Chicago to investigate their public transportation. She met Jane Addams and stayed at Hull House in 1908. There, she participated in the group&#x27;s programs which included teaching immigrant women English, job and homemaking skills.

Tarbell and the other editors decided to sell &quot;The American Magazine&quot; to the Crowell Publishing company in 1911. John Phillips sold his remaining interests to Crowell Publishing Company in 1915. Phillips became a consultant to the magazine, John Siddell became the editor, and Tarbell turned to freelance writing.

Tarbell examined the positive side of American business in a series of articles written between 1912 and 1916. She toured the United States and met with factory owners and workers and their families. Tarbell said of her own muckraking reputation, &quot;Was it not the duty of those who were called muckrakers to rake up the good earth as well as the noxious?&quot; She was fascinated by Thomas Lynch of the Frick Coke Company, who was committed to providing decent living conditions for his workers and believed that &quot;Safety First&quot; was preferable to accidents. Tarbell also admired and wrote about Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford and his belief that offering high pay would create excellent work, as well as his ideas around mass production.

== Women&#x27;s suffrage ==
Steve Weinberg wrote that Ida Tarbell was &quot;a feminist by example, but not by ideology&quot;. Feminist scholars viewed Tarbell as an enigma as she seemed to both embrace the movement and act as a critic. While her accomplishments were many, Tarbell also challenged and questioned the logic of women&#x27;s suffrage. Early in life, Tarbell was exposed to the suffrage movement when her mother hosted meetings in their home. Tarbell was put off by women such as Mary Livermore and Frances Willard who she said never paid attention to her. By contrast, Tarbell noted, the men her father hosted showed interest in her. Tarbell did say that the movement sparked in her a desire to attend college and receive an education.

Starting in 1909, Tarbell wrote more about women and traditional roles. Tarbell was alienated by the more militant aspects of the movement and described it as anti-male. She recommended that women embrace home life and the family, saying they had a &quot;true role as wives, mothers, and homemakers&quot;. One biographer, Emily Arnold McCully, believed that her stance on women&#x27;s issues may have tarnished her long-term legacy. Tarbell felt that &quot;the drive for suffrage&quot; was &quot;a misguided war on men&quot;. Former allies among suffragists were dismayed at her change and her speaking to anti-suffragist organizations. Tarbell published the article &quot;Making a Man of Herself&quot; in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in 1912, which infuriated her readers and activists. Historian Robert Stinson believed that she was making new public statements about the ambiguity she had lived in her own life, which defined women&#x27;s roles based upon their nature and saw attempts to push the boundaries into men&#x27;s realms as unnatural. McCully supposed &quot;that suffrage was a human&#x27;s rights issue seemed not to occur to her, perhaps because, as a historian, she was much better looking backward than she was at anticipating the future.&quot;

Tarbell collected her essays on women and published them in a book called &quot;The Business of Being a Woman&quot;. The book, which was poorly received, contained tributes to early supporters of women including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Tarbell said of the book: &quot;That title was like a red rag to many of my militant friends. The idea that woman had a business assigned by nature and society which was of more importance than public life disturbed them; even if it was so, they did not want it emphasized&quot;. Even Tarbell&#x27;s own mother, Esther, who was a lifelong suffragist, criticized Ida&#x27;s position.

Tarbell switched course and embraced suffrage after American women won the right to vote in 1920. She wrote an article for &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; in 1924 to dispel the myth that suffrage had failed. She wrote: &quot;twenty million women did vote and should vote.&quot; When asked if she believed that a woman would one day be President of the United States, Tarbell pointed out that women had ruled nations in some cases better than kings and pointed to examples of Catherine the Great of Russia, Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz of Prussia, Elizabeth I of England and Catherine de&#x27; Medici of France.

Tarbell worked to help women who had &quot;no choice but to work, often under horrifying conditions.&quot; She wrote about workplace safety and covered the realities of factories where women worked. She became an advocate for Taylorism, a system for scientific management of production, encouraging its use in home economics. She became a member of the Taylor Society. She visited more than fifty-five businesses for the article, &quot;The Golden Rule of Business,&quot; to see how &quot;scientific management and Christian values&quot; worked together. She decided it was the best way to protect workers and at the same time maximize profits.

Tarbell was a founding member of the Authors&#x27; League in 1914: a collective to support working writers which later became the Authors Guild.

Tarbell&#x27;s career shifted in 1915 when American Magazine named John Siddall as editor. Tarbell joined the Chautauqua Science and Literary Circuit, a lecture and entertainment tour filled with public speakers, singers and other acts such as trained dogs and yodelers. Before the tour, Tarbell trained for public speaking with Frank Sargent of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. The tour schedule was brutal. Tarbell said, &quot;...I signed up for a seven weeks&#x27; circuit, forty-nine days in forty-nine different places&quot;. Tarbell was exhausted at the end but went on to sign up for more over the next few years. Tarbell lectured throughout the United States on subjects from the evils of war, peace, politics, trusts, tariffs, labor and labors of women.

== World War I ==

When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, President Woodrow Wilson invited Tarbell to take part in a new committee: the Women&#x27;s Committee of the Council of National Defense. The Suffragists on the committee were initially unhappy about Tarbell&#x27;s appointment, but her &quot;warmth and group spirit&quot; won them over. The goal of the women&#x27;s committee was to mobilize the war efforts of American women and the first issue addressed was a developing food crisis. The group encouraged women to plant vegetable gardens and promoted both drying and canning of foods. Other efforts included knitting, sewing, bandage making, and the opening of day-care centers to operate while women began working in factories. Tarbell often served as a go-between with the Men&#x27;s Council and the Woman&#x27;s Committee.

Tarbell had a number of setbacks in 1917. Her mother died in September, and upon Tarbell&#x27;s return to Washington, D.C., the following year, Tarbell collapsed. 
She was sent to Johns Hopkins Hospital, where she was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and she spent three months in the hospital recovering. Tarbell also began showing beginning signs of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Her doctor did not share his diagnosis with her. It was not until years later, as her tremors worsened and affected her handwriting, that she finally learned of the diagnosis.

The Women&#x27;s Committee was disbanded with the end of the war in 1918, and Tarbell traveled once again to Paris, France. Some of her former &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; colleagues were also there for the Paris Peace Conference: John S. Phillips as editor of the Red Cross Magazine and Ray Stannard Baker as an assistant to President Woodrow Wilson. President Wilson had wanted Tarbell in the official U.S. legation, but, unbeknownst to Tarbell, Secretary of State Robert Lansing had refused to have a female on his team.

Tarbell wrote for the Red Cross magazine and interviewed Parisians about how the war had affected them. She also traveled to the countryside to interview farmers living in the wreckage of their former homes. Tarbell focused on the experience of the average Frenchwoman with such articles as &quot;The French Woman and Her New World,&quot; &quot;The Homing Instinct of Woman,&quot; and &quot;That Brave Northwest.&quot;

== Later career ==
Tarbell&#x27;s later career included writing, lecturing, and social work. Tarbell continued working as a freelancing journalist and traveling the lecture circuit. She served on two Presidential Conferences. Tarbell was a member of President Wilson&#x27;s Industrial Conference in 1919, representing the Pen and Brush Club of Gramercy Park, New York City, and served on a committee looking into hours of labor along with Robert Brookings. Among recommendations of Tarbell&#x27;s committee were protections aimed at the health of women workers including an eight-hour day, six-day work week and no work between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. John D. Rockefeller Jr. was also a representative at the Conference. Tarbell also participated in President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s 1921 Unemployment Conference, the conference suggested by Herbert Hoover to address a recession. Among the committees Tarbell served on were Organization, Public Works, Civic Emergency Measures, Publications, and Standing Committee of the Conference.

Tarbell published her only novel, &quot;The Rising of the Tide,&quot; in 1919. She wrote articles about the disarmament conference for McClure&#x27;s syndicate and published them later in the book, &quot;Peacemakers—Blessed and Otherwise&quot;.

Tarbell also wrote another biography, this one of Judge Elbert H. Gary, the chairman of U.S. Steel Corporation. She was not initially interested in the biography, but Gary convinced her that if she uncovered any wrongdoings committed by his company, he meant to correct them. She earned $10,000 for the book, and although she thought her work was courageous, critics described her work as cowardly. One review was titled, &quot;The Taming of Ida Tarbell,&quot; and accused her of falling in with her sworn enemy, big business.

Tarbell completed a series of articles on Benito Mussolini for McCall&#x27;s magazine in the 1920s. The portrait Tarbell painted of Mussolini, comparing him to Napoleon, was flattering. Her former colleague, Viola Roseboro, remarked after meeting up with Tarbell in Italy, &quot;I heard her let go about that dimple several times. All those things that are at such a variance with the old work horse she calls herself and to the serious worker she is and is known for pleases me a lot&quot;. It was speculated that in Tarbell&#x27;s eyes she may have imagined Mussolini as &quot;finishing the work of the Progressive Era at the small price of a few civil liberties&quot;.

Tarbell&#x27;s final business biography was a profile of Owen D. Young, the president of General Electric and founder of Radio Corporation of America and then NBC. Amidst speculation that Young was gearing up for a Presidential run, the biography was reviewed as a campaign biography.

Tarbell was approached by Arthur Schlesinger Sr. to contribute to his series &quot;A History of American Life&quot; in 1923. She did not complete &quot;The Nationalizing of Business&quot; until 1936.

In addition to serving as the President of the Pen and Brush Club for 30 years beginning in 1913, Tarbell was also a member of the Colony Club and the Cosmopolitan Club.

==Death and legacy==
Tarbell completed her autobiography, &quot;All in a Day&#x27;s Work&quot;, in 1939 when she was 82. Reviews were mixed for the book. She was working on another book, &quot;Life After Eighty&quot;, when she died of pneumonia at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Connecticut on January 6, 1944. She had been in the hospital since December 1943. She was 86.

In 1993 the Ida Tarbell House in Easton, Connecticut was declared a National Historic Landmark. In 2000, Tarbell was inducted posthumously into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. On September 14, 2002, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp honoring Tarbell as part of a series of four stamps honoring women journalists.

Long past Tarbell&#x27;s life, she has received praise and accolades for her contribution to journalism and American history. Everett E. Dennis, Executive Director of the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center at Columbia University stated in 1993 that Tarbell helped invent modern journalism. Historian and Professor of History at the University of New Hampshire, Ellen F. FitzPatrick, called Tarbell one of the great American journalists of the 20th century. &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company&quot; was listed as No. 5 in a 1999 list by New York University of the top 100 works of 20th-century American journalism. Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, in her book &quot;The Bully Pulpit&quot;, would call Tarbell&#x27;s series on Standard Oil, &quot;a landmark series that would affirm her reputation as the leading investigative journalist of her day&quot;. Economic historian Daniel Yergin, in his Pulitzer-Prize winning book, &quot;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power&quot;, described Tarbell&#x27;s book on Standard Oil as arguably, &quot;the single most influential book on business ever published in the United States&quot;.

The investigative techniques she developed while researching this volume influenced Steve Weinberg, one-time executive director of the non-profit Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc., to base training programs for the NGO and classrooms using her methodology. While &quot;yellow journalists&quot; and muckrakers both rejected the notion of neutrality, &quot;yellow journalists&quot; focused on sensationalism and were not overly concerned with verifying the veracity of their stories. Muckrakers like Tarbell and Upton Sinclair, on the other hand, wrote detailed, thoroughly verified, and accurate descriptions of the social issues of their day, laying the groundwork for legal changes, ethical standards in journalism, and what is now known as investigative journalism.

&quot;Tarbell&quot;, the non-partisan news publication of the non-profit &quot;To Be Fair&quot;, is named after her.

== Writing style and methodology ==
Tarbell was known for her strong work ethic in writing. Tarbell&#x27;s early background in the sciences brought a touch of scientific inquiry to her investigations. Each statement she made was supported by facts so much so that her early works have been described as drowning in facts. Her method was also scholarly and driven by the demands of magazine deadlines. She could dictate as many as twenty letters a day from a &quot;To Be Answered&quot; pile on her desk.

Tarbell was extremely thorough when conducting research. At the time she began Lincoln&#x27;s biography, he had been dead for only 30 years, and Tarbell traveled far and wide interviewing Lincoln&#x27;s contemporaries. Her research uncovered more than 300 documents including unpublished speeches, letters, pictures and personal anecdotes. It was through the use of well-selected anecdotes in her biographies that Tarbell was able to breathe life into the subject and offer new perspectives. When writing a biography, Tarbell suggested that the writer should &quot;start by wiping out of his mind all that he knows about the man, start as if you had never before heard of him. Everything then is fresh, new. Your mind, feeding on this fresh material, sees things in a new way&quot;. Tarbell&#x27;s inclusion of anecdotes gave new perspectives to her subjects. Tarbell double-checked the Lincoln articles for accuracy by sending them out to those whose information she had included.

Tarbell&#x27;s writing has been described by a biographer as fair and professional, (though some later observers have been less kind, accusing her of cherry picking data to support her conclusions) and her methods have been used widely to train other investigative journalists. When conducting and presenting the details about Standard Oil&#x27;s business practices she wanted to present her materials as historical documentation and narrative. Tarbell&#x27;s technique in researching corporations through government documents, lawsuits, and interviews managed to break through a secretive corporation and evasive CEO.

Tarbell liked to work from a desk covered in research materials. While working on &quot;The History of Standard Oil&quot;, Tarbell worked from home in her study with a break once a day to go to the &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; office. At home in New York, she sat on a bentwood chair at a partners desk with messy heaps of paper. Tarbell would gather the books, transcripts, and clippings she needed, put them in order and write. When a chapter was finished and handed in, she reviewed the material again and rearranged its order for her next installment. On her Connecticut farm, Tarbell worked from a mahogany desk in a sunny library.

==Representation in other media==
Charles Klein&#x27;s political play, &quot;The Lion and the Mouse&quot; (1905), opened soon after Tarbell&#x27;s series on Standard Oil had been published in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine,&quot; and the plot was thought to be based on her campaign. (Its title is that of an Aesop&#x27;s fable.) Its 686 continuous performances set a record for any American play in New York, and four road companies took the play on the road.

&quot;Drunk History&quot; Season 5 Episode 6 titled &quot;Underdogs&quot; features Shannon Woodward as Tarbell. Retelling by John Gabrus.

<text>Henry Adrian &quot;Packy&quot; Schade (December 3, 1900 – August 12, 1992) was a United States Navy officer, naval architect, and professor.

During World War II, Schade was Head of the Carrier Desk for the United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships. In this capacity he was highly influential in the development of all classes of aircraft carriers commissioned during the war, particularly the . Schade added materially in overcoming the shortage of aircraft carriers of all types by overseeing their accelerated construction thereby contributing to the defeat of the German Submarine campaign, the shift from the defensive to the offensive in the Pacific, and the subsequent successful prosecution of the war.

Near the end of the war, Schade served as Chief of the United States Naval Technical Mission in Europe. The Mission was charged with the responsibility of exploiting German science and technology for the benefit of the United States Navy&#x27;s technical Bureaus.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. He attended Central High School. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy by the US Congressman from the Fourth District of Minnesota in 1919.

He was called &quot;Packy II&quot; at first, after a more athletic student who had attended six years earlier at the Academy. His own athletic talents led his classmates to drop the &quot;II&quot; later.

He was on the Plebe and Junior Varsity crew teams.

In 1923, Schade graduated from the Naval Academy with distinction, seventh in his class of 414. On He was commissioned Ensign in the United States Navy and ordered to the battleship . There Schade became Communication Watch Officer.

In May 1925, Schade started postgraduate work in Naval Architecture at the Naval Academy&#x27;s Postgraduate School, Annapolis, Maryland. In 1926, he attended the Construction Corps. He continued his education at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received his Master of Science degree in Naval Architecture in June 1928. Schade&#x27;s Masters thesis entitled &quot;Deformation and Stresses in Pipe Bends&quot; was published later that same year by MIT&#x27;s Department of Naval Construction.

==Early naval career==
After graduating from MIT, Schade was briefly at the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland and then at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York City. From October 1928, and for the three succeeding years, Schade served in the Industrial Department at Mare Island Navy Yard, California. In December 1931 Schade joined the Design Section within the Bureau of Construction and Repair. He was promoted to lieutenant. He furthered the development of the use of welding in naval ship construction until January 1935.

Schade was then assigned to the Experimental Model Basin, which was then at the Washington Navy Yard. Detached from the Model Basin in July 1936, he was ordered overseas to attend the Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg. In June 1937 Schade received the degree of Doctor of Engineering in Naval Architecture for his research on strength of ship structures and his landmark dissertation entitled &quot;Statik des Schiff-Bodens unter Wasserdruck.&quot; An English translation by Schade was published as &quot;Theory of Motions of Craft in Waves.&quot;

After graduating, but prior to leaving Europe, the Bureau of Ships ordered Schade on a tour of inspection, as student observer, of representative shipbuilding plants and model basins in German ports; plus naval establishments of The Netherlands, France, Britain, Italy, and Austria. Completing his tour of European naval facilities by the end of August, 1937, Schade then returned to the United States.

Lieutenant Schade was then ordered to serve in the Office of the Superintending Constructor, later redesignated Office of the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Virginia. On June 23, 1938, less than one year into his duty at Newport News, Schade was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander. Also that summer, the professional organization of Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME) published Schade&#x27;s paper on his study of &quot;Bending Theory of Ship Bottom Structure.&quot; In June 1940, all Constructors (Naval Architects) and Engineers (Marine Engineers) were united into a new Bureau of Ships All such technical personnel were then transferred from the line of the Navy and redesignated Engineering Duty Only - or EDOs.

This massive reorganization of the Navy&#x27;s technical Bureaus created new opportunities for younger officers with potential. Following the reorganization of the Bureau he was promoted to commander. He assumed the billet of Senior Naval Liaison Officer (SNLO) assigned to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock. The SNLO is the direct link between BuShips&#x27; ship &quot;type desk&quot; and the actual building and builder stationed in their yard. At this time Newport News was tackling the mighty job of acting as design agent, responsible for the creation of detailed working drawings, for the Navy&#x27;s new s. This made Schade the Carrier (type) Desk&#x27;s direct liaison at Newport News solely to effect work on the &quot;Essex&quot; design.

During 1941, the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers again published one of Schade&#x27;s studies. His new study was entitled: &quot;Design Curves for Cross-Stiffened Plating Under Uniform Bending Load.&quot; This paper proved to be an important work, as the theories espoused therein by Schade were thereafter accepted and adopted by BuShips as new policy and practice regarding estimating static responses on welded stiffened ship panels.

Just four days before the Japanese aerial attack on Pearl Harbor, Commander Schade celebrated his 42nd birthday. By all accounts he had done a tremendous job over the previous two years at Newport News working diligently on the &quot;Essex&quot; project. His efforts had not gone unnoticed in the Bureau of Ships. With the nation now at war, his reward would not be long in coming.

==World War II==
Pearl Harbor had a dramatic impact on the leadership of BuShips. The Bureau&#x27;s Chief, RAdm. Samuel M. &quot;Mike&quot; Robinson, and Deputy Chief, RAdm. Alexander H. Van Keuren, immediately recognized that this new war would be conducted just as the Japanese conducted the raid on Pearl Harbor. This would be a carrier war. To successfully prosecute this war, the United States Navy would need both better carriers and more of them to defeat their enemies. To get these ships built both quickly and properly would take skill, ability, and leadership. To get that leadership they would need to fill each key position within the Bureau with the officer best suited to handle the colossal challenges that lie before them.

The Chief and Deputy Chief of BuShips wasted no time reorganizing their personnel to meet the demands of a two-ocean war. In the weeks following the attack on Pearl Harbor orders were sent to ships and stations around the world recalling the people they felt best suited for a particular task. One such recall was Commander Schade. Ordered detached from his role as SNLO at Newport News in late December 1941, he was to report to &quot;Main Navy&quot; for duty at the Bureau of Ships by January 1, 1942.

Just three weeks after turning 42, Schade had been identified as the ideal candidate to head the Bureau&#x27;s Carrier Desk during the country&#x27;s first-ever carrier war. Quite a responsibility for a commander. Nearly all of the Bureau&#x27;s ship type desks were run by officers with the rank of captain. The fact that the most important ship type, arguably the aircraft carrier, for the anticipated nature of fighting would be placed in the hands of a mere commander speaks volumes as to the complete faith both Robinson and Van Keuren had in Schade. There were thousands within the bureau that in some way would contribute to developing the Navy&#x27;s carriers, but it was up to Schade to get those carriers built and fully prepared to join the fleet.

In January 1942 Schade was assigned to the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ships, where he was responsible for the design of the carriers, with innovations including the use of the flight deck as a structural element (previously flight decks were flimsy wooden platforms perched above the ship proper).

For Schade&#x27;s efforts as head of the Carrier Desk during World War II, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. The commendation attached to his award read as follows:

Two days before Christmas, 1944, Captain Schade was advanced to the rank of commodore.

In January 1945, Commodore Schade was ordered to report to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations for a very special reassignment of duty. Schade was to create, and head, a team of scientific and technical specialists to obtain and exploit German science and technologies in areas immediately behind the front lines of fighting in Europe. As allied ground forces gained ground, Schade and his scientists would rush into the void left behind advancing forces to study the equipment and weaponry employed by the Germans. The United States Naval Technical Mission in Europe was particularly interested the capture and study of rocketry and all things naval as German ports and bases were wrested from Hitler&#x27;s forces. Schade initially headquartered the Mission in Paris, but soon the Mission was constantly on the move as allied forces advanced more and more rapidly deeper into German-occupied territories and then into Germany itself.

==Post-War==
Schade&#x27;s exceptional work as chief of the United States Naval Technical Mission in Europe earned him a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit. The commendation which accompanied his Gold Star read as follows:

Following the war, Schade was also bestowed with the American Defense Service Medal, the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the American Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. Additionally, the Government of Great Britain made Schade an Honorary Officer of the Military Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.

On November 1, 1945, he was appointed Director of the Naval Research Laboratory, at Anacostia, relieving the man who had chosen him to run the Carrier Desk at the outbreak of the war, Rear Admiral Alexander H. Van Keuren. The NRL conducted the most sophisticated and extensive forms of research and experiments in the Navy Department for the benefit of her technical bureaus.

Schade remained as Director of the Naval Research Laboratory until his retirement from the Navy Department on February 1, 1949.

==Teaching career==
Schade was named Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Director of Research for the University of California College of Engineering at Berkeley effective upon his retirement from the US Navy.

In 1950, Schade&#x27;s doctoral dissertation &quot;Statik Des Schift-Bodens Unter-Wasserdruck,&quot; written for Technische Hochschule 13 years prior in Berlin, was translated to English by Packy Schade himself and published as &quot;Theory of Motions of Craft in Waves&quot; by the Department of Engineering, University of California, Berkeley.

In 1958 he organized a Department of Naval Architecture at Berkeley, serving as its first chair. (The department later added offshore engineering, but was always small, and finally disbanded in 1998).

He received the David W. Taylor Medal in 1964. In 1970 Schade received the Gibbs Brothers Medal of the National Academy of Sciences, and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1973.

==Retirement, family, and death==
Commodore Schade finally retired from University of California at Berkeley in 1968.

Schade and his wife, the former Alice Houseman of Pasadena, California, had two sons, Henry A. Schade, Jr. and Richard J. Schade. Alice Schade died in 1990. Commodore Henry Adrian &quot;Packy&quot; Schade died less than two years later in 1992.

==Legacy==
Rear Admiral Henry Adrian &quot;Packy&quot; Schade proved just the right man, placed in exactly the right job, at precisely the right time. His particular expertise in the strength of welded ship structures made him uniquely qualified to oversee the rapid construction of the US Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier building program during the world&#x27;s first ever carrier war.

Modern day researchers of World War II era aircraft carriers, both student and professional, can visit the records of BuShips held at the National Archives and Records Administration, in College Park, Maryland. There they will find, indelibly marked for posterity, Schade&#x27;s impact on the US Navy carrier program. The serial number of nearly every carrier document carries the mark of &quot;(512)&quot; - Schade&#x27;s Carrier Desk; and nearly all of those bear his classic handwritten big, bold, openly scripted partial signature &quot;Sch&quot;.

Schade indeed left his mark upon BuShips during World War II, but he also continues to impact lives today. Professional papers of modern-day Naval Architects frequently draw upon his concepts, passages, and papers as references for their own academic studies. Students are still today exploring Schade&#x27;s original theoretical thinking on &quot;effective breadth of ship structures&quot; and often cite his works in their doctoral dissertations.

Commodore Henry Adrian &quot;Packy&quot; Schade may be the least known man of World War II. But, he may also be as equally responsible for victory in the Pacific as any pilot that ever took off from, or landed on, one of his carriers.

<doc id="196070" wikidata="Q1825813" url="?curid=196070" title="Lincoln Steffens">
<text>Joseph Lincoln Steffens (April 6, 1866 – August 9, 1936) was an American investigative journalist and one of the leading muckrakers of the Progressive Era in the early 20th century. He launched a series of articles in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, called &quot;Tweed Days in St. Louis&quot;, that would later be published together in a book titled &quot;The Shame of the Cities&quot;. He is remembered for investigating corruption in municipal government in American cities and for his leftist values.

==Early life==
Steffens was born in San Francisco, California, the only son and eldest of four children of Elizabeth Louisa (Symes) Steffens and Joseph Steffens. He was raised largely in Sacramento, the state capital; the Steffens family mansion, a Victorian house on H Street bought from merchant Albert Gallatin in 1887, would become the California Governor&#x27;s Mansion in 1903.

Steffens attended St Mathews, where he frequently clashed with the school&#x27;s founder and director, stern disciplinarian, Alfred Lee Brewer.

==Career==


Steffens began his journalism career at the &quot;New York Commercial Advertiser&quot; in the 1890s, before moving to the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;. From 1902 to 1906, he became an editor of &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; magazine, where he became part of a celebrated muckraking trio with Ida Tarbell and Ray Stannard Baker. He specialized in investigating government and political corruption, and two collections of his articles were published as &quot;The Shame of the Cities&quot; (1904) and &quot;The Struggle for Self-Government&quot; (1906). He also wrote &quot;The Traitor State&quot; (1905), which criticized New Jersey for patronizing incorporation. In 1906, he left &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, along with Tarbell and Baker, to form &quot;The American Magazine&quot;. In &quot;The Shame of the Cities&quot;, Steffens sought to bring about political reform in urban America by appealing to the emotions of Americans. He tried to provoke outrage with examples of corrupt governments throughout urban America.

From 1914 to 1915, he covered the Mexican Revolution and began to see revolution as preferable to reform. In March 1919, he accompanied William C. Bullitt, a low-level State Department official, on a three-week visit to Soviet Russia and witnessed the &quot;confusing and difficult&quot; process of society in the process of revolutionary change. He wrote that &quot;Soviet Russia was a revolutionary government with an evolutionary plan&quot;, enduring &quot;a temporary condition of evil, which is made tolerable by hope and a plan.&quot;

After his return, he promoted his view of the Soviet Revolution and in the course of campaigning for U.S. food aid for Russia made his famous remark about the new Soviet society: &quot;I have seen the future, and it works&quot;, a phrase he often repeated with many variations. The title page of his wife Ella Winter&#x27;s &quot;Red Virtue: Human Relationships in the New Russia&quot; (Victor Gollancz, 1933) carries this quote.

His enthusiasm for communism soured by the time his memoirs appeared in 1931. The autobiography became a bestseller leading to a short return to prominence for the writer, but Steffens would not be able to capitalize on it as illness cut his lecture tour of America short by 1933. He was a member of the California Writers Project, a New Deal program.

Steffens married the twenty-six-year-old socialist writer Leonore (Ella) Sophie Winter in 1924 and moved to Italy, where their son Peter was born in San Remo. 

In 1927, they relocated to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, the most significant art colony on the Pacific Coast, and settled in a cottage close to the intersection of San Antonio Street and Ocean Avenue. During their stay, he authored his autobiography and managed the &quot;Pacific Weekly.&quot; The cottage underwent renovation in 1992.

Ella and Lincoln soon became controversial figures in the leftist politics of the region. 

When John O’Shea, one of the local Carmel artists and a friend of the couple, exhibited his study of &quot;Mr. Steffens’ soul&quot;, an image which resembled a grotesque daemon, Lincoln took a certain pride in the drawing and enjoyed the publicity it generated. 

In 1934, Steffens and Winter helped found the San Francisco Workers&#x27; School (later the California Labor School); Steffens also served there as an advisor.

==Death==

Steffens died of a heart condition on August 9, 1936, in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.

In 2011, Kevin Baker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lamented that &quot;Lincoln Steffens isn&#x27;t much remembered today&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Lincoln Steffens is mentioned in the Danny DeVito movie &quot;Jack the Bear&quot; (1993). 
Lincoln Steffens is mentioned in the 1987 novel &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; by Tom Wolfe.

Characters on the American crime drama series &quot;City on a Hill&quot;, which debuted in 2019, make numerous references to Lincoln Steffens.

The &quot;Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens&quot; is the favorite book of one of the members of The Group in Mary McCarthy&#x27;s 1963 novel of the same title.

&quot;Autobiography of Lincoln Steffens&quot; is mentioned in the Joseph McElroy novel &quot;Women and Men&quot;. And it is mentioned as a favorite by Marilyn Monroe in her Autobiography &quot;My Story&quot; (she reads it during the making of &quot;All About Eve&quot; and is warned by Joseph L. Mankiewicz to not tell anyone due to possible Communist ties).

Lincoln Steffens is a somewhat frustrated witness to the political intrigue of the remapping of Europe following WW1 in the 1940 novel &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot; by Upton Sinclair. In &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;, Sinclair refers to Steffens as a muckraker. The same label has been assigned to Sinclair himself.

<doc id="196072" wikidata="Q5481762" url="?curid=196072" title="Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell">
<text>Francis Lovell, 9th Baron Lovell, 6th Baron Holand, later 1st Viscount Lovell, (1456 – probably 1487) was an English nobleman who was an ally of King Richard III during the War of the Roses. Sir William Catesby, Sir Richard Ratcliffe and he were among Richard&#x27;s closest supporters, famously called &quot;the Cat, the Rat and Lovell our dog&quot; in an anti-Ricardian squib. In addition to being an ally, Lovell is described as Richard&#x27;s best friend.

Lovell continued the Yorkist resistance into the early years of Henry VII&#x27;s reign, but his fate is unknown after he disappeared following the final defeat of the Yorkists at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487.

==Early life==
Francis was the son of John Lovell, 8th Baron Lovel, and Joan Beaumont, daughter of John Beaumont, 1st Viscount Beaumont. When his father died, the probably eight-year-old Francis inherited the titles of Baron Lovel and Baron Holand. He became a ward of Edward IV of England, who gave him into the charge of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, where Edward&#x27;s youngest brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, also spent some time. It may have been there that the two young men first formed their close association.

By 1466, he was married to Anne FitzHugh, daughter of Henry FitzHugh, 5th Baron FitzHugh. They had a daughter named Agnes and a son whose name is unknown. Neither child seems to have survived past the age of four. FitzHugh had married the Earl of Warwick&#x27;s sister Alice Neville and supported Warwick&#x27;s rebellion against Edward IV in 1470. As the pardon issued to Henry, Lord FitzHugh includes Francis Lovell it can be assumed that Francis lived with his father-in-law at this time. When Edward IV had re-established his rule in 1471, he granted the wardship of Francis Lovell, who was still underage, to his sister Elizabeth and her husband John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk.

Upon the death of his paternal grandmother Alice Deincourt in 1474 he inherited a large estate, including the lands of the baronies of Deincourt, Grey of Rotherfield, and the feudal barony of Bedale, long a possession of the Stapleton family. The arms of these families all appear on his Garter stall plate in St George&#x27;s Chapel, and in stained glass windows at Carlton Towers. He was now one of the wealthiest barons in England not holding an Earldom or Dukedom.

==Follower of Richard III==
Lovell became a follower of his friend, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to whom he was also linked through their respective marriages: his wife, Anne FitzHugh was the first cousin of Richard&#x27;s wife Anne Neville. Lovell served under Richard in the expedition to Scotland in 1482, and was knighted by Richard for it, the same year. After the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483 he became one of his patron&#x27;s strongest supporters, though he seems not to have taken an active political part in the proceedings at that time. He had been created a viscount on 4 January 1483, and while still Lord Protector Richard made him Chief Butler and constable of Wallingford Castle.

Richard acceded to the throne on 26 June 1483; at his coronation on 6 July 1483, Francis Lovell bore the third sword of state. His wife, Anne, was part of the coronation train of the new queen along with her mother, Lady FitzHugh, and sister, Lady Elizabeth Parr. Lovell was promoted to the office of Lord Chamberlain, replacing the late William Hastings, and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1483. Lovell helped in the suppression of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion (1483).

In July 1484, William Collingbourne, a Tudor agent, tacked up a lampooning poem at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, which mentions Lovell, whose family&#x27;s heraldic symbol was a silver wolf, among the three aides to King Richard, whose emblem was a white boar:
The poem was interpolated into Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film &quot;Richard III&quot;, a screen adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play.

==Bosworth and aftermath==
In June 1485, Lovell was appointed to guard the south coast to prevent the landing of Henry Tudor. However, Henry Tudor landed in Wales near Milford Haven avoiding the stronger defences of the English south coast. While no chronicle account of the battle mentions Lovell, it seems certain that he fought for Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field (22 August 1485). Two reports written in the immediate aftermath of the battle list him as among the fallen. In fact, he escaped. After the battle, Lovell fled to sanctuary at Colchester and from there escaped the following year to organise a revolt in Yorkshire that attempted to seize Henry VII. After the failure of this plot, Lovell tried seizing Henry VII in York by himself, and is believed to have been behind an attempted assassination of Henry in York. After the failure of both these attempts, he first joined fellow rebels at Furness Fells, and later fled to Margaret of York in Flanders.

As a chief leader of the Yorkist party, Lovell took a prominent part in Lambert Simnel&#x27;s enterprise. With John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, he accompanied the pretender to Ireland and fought for him at the Battle of Stoke Field on 16 June 1487. He was seen escaping from the battle and may have eventually fled to Scotland, where on 19 June 1488 James IV issued a safe conduct to him. There is, however, no indication that Lovell ever arrived or lived in Scotland, and no further information about his fate.

Lovell&#x27;s wife, Anne Fitzhugh, was granted an annuity of £20 in 1489. She was still alive in 1495; the date of her death is not known.

==Later reports about his death==
Francis Bacon relates that according to one report he lived long afterward in a cave or vault.

More than 200 years later, in 1708, the skeleton of a man was found in a secret chamber in the family mansion at Minster Lovell in Oxfordshire, and it was supposed that Lovell had hidden himself there and died of starvation. While this story is very picturesque, it seems unlikely to be true. Lovell had hardly spent any time at Minster Lovell, and would not have had a faithful servant there who would hide him for years. Additionally, the manor had been granted to Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford, Henry Tudor&#x27;s uncle, and was therefore hardly an appropriate hiding place for Francis Lovell.

On the Nottinghamshire History website, a reference is made to the &quot;Transactions of the Thoroton Society&quot; and the Society&#x27;s visit on 30 June 1903 to All Hallows&#x27; Church, Gedling, Nottinghamshire. It notes that there were only three pre-Reformation sepulchral slabs: The third slab, an alabaster one, lies at the south end of the altar-table. A few lines in black wax constitute the remains of an inscription and effigy of a knight of the 15th century. The late Mr. Lawson Lowe, of Chepstow, said in December, 1882, that when he visited the church in 1865, the date could be made out, and he thought the effigy might be that of a knight who fought at the battle of Stoke, near Newark, in 1487. Gedling Church and Stoke Bardolph Castle, the ancestral home of Joan Bardolph who was Francis&#x27;s great-grandmother, lie just a few miles away from the battlefield of Stoke. It is feasible that Francis attempted to escape across the river at the Fiskerton shallows but was either killed or died later of his wounds, his body being buried under the flagstones in the Gedling Church in order to prevent the certain fate of then being &#x27;hung, drawn and quartered&#x27;. An argument that a chantry chapel in the church was founded for Francis Lovell, and may have been his burial site, has been published on the church website.

<text>Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) is a non-governmental organization. It was founded by Ralph Nader in 1995 and was then called Consumer Project on Technology. It deals with issues related to the effects of intellectual property on public health, cyberlaw and e-commerce, and competition policy. It has fought the Microsoft monopoly, the ICANN monopoly, software patents, and business method patents. It has supported free software in government, open access for the Internet, and privacy regulation. KEI works on access to medicines, including a major effort on compulsory licensing of patents. Beginning in 2002, CPTech began to work with Tim Hubbard and others on a new trade framework for medical research and development (R&amp;D). In the context of current bilateral agreements, this is referred to as R&amp;D+, which in contrast to TRIPS+ approaches.

In 2006, the MacArthur Foundation awarded KEI a MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions, saying in part:
