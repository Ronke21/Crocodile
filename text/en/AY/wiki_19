<text>Assamese () or Asamiya ( ) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken mainly in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam, where it is an official language. It has long served as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in parts of Northeast India. It has over 15 million native speakers according to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;.

Nefamese, an Assamese-based pidgin in Arunachal Pradesh, was used as a lingua franca till it was replaced by Hindi; and Nagamese, an Assamese-based Creole language, continues to be widely used in Nagaland. The Kamtapuri language of Rangpur division of Bangladesh and the Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts of India is linguistically closer to Assamese, though the speakers identify with the Bengali culture and the literary language. In the past, it was the court language of the Ahom kingdom from the 17th century.

Along with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Assamese evolved at least before the 7th century CE from the middle Indo-Aryan Magadhi Prakrit. Its sister languages include Angika, Bengali, Bishnupriya Manipuri, Noakhali, Chakma, Chittagonian, Hajong, Rajbangsi, Maithili, Rohingya and Sylheti. It is written in the Assamese alphabet, an abugida system, from left to right, with many typographic ligatures.

Assamese was designated as a classical Indian language by the Government of India on 3 October 2024 on account of its antiquity and literary traditions.

==History==
Assamese originated in Old Indo-Aryan dialects, though the exact nature of its origin and growth is not clear yet. It is generally believed that Assamese and the Kamatapuri lects derive from the Kamarupi dialect of Eastern Magadhi Prakrit though some authors contest a close connection of Assamese with Magadhi Prakrit. The Indo-Aryan, which appeared in the 4th–5th century in Assam, was probably spoken in the new settlements of Kamarupa—in urban centers and along the Brahmaputra river—surrounded by Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic communities. Kakati&#x27;s (1941) assertion that Assamese has an Austroasiatic substrate is generally assumed—which suggests that when the Indo-Aryan centers formed in the 4th–5th centuries CE, there were substantial Austroasiatic speakers that later accepted the Indo-Aryan vernacular. Based on the 7th-century Chinese traveller Xuanzang&#x27;s observations, suggests that the Indo-Aryan vernacular differentiated itself in Kamarupa before it did in Bengal, and that these differences could be attributed to non-Indo-Aryan speakers adopting the language. The newly differentiated vernacular, from which Assamese eventually emerged, is evident in the Prakritisms present in the Sanskrit of the Kamarupa inscriptions.

===Magadhan and Gauda-Kamarupa stages===
The earliest forms of Assamese in literature are found in the 9th-century Buddhist verses called Charyapada the language of which bear affinities with Assamese (as well as Bengali, Maithili and Odia) and which belongs to a period when the Prakrit was at the cusp of differentiating into regional languages. The spirit and expressiveness of the &quot;Charyadas&quot; are today found in the folk songs called &quot;Deh-Bicarar Git&quot;.

In the 12th-14th century works of Ramai Pundit (&quot;Sunya Puran&quot;), Boru Chandidas (&quot;Krishna Kirtan&quot;), Sukur Mamud (&quot;Gopichandrar Gan&quot;), Durllava Mullik (&quot;Gobindachandrar Git&quot;) and Bhavani Das (&quot;Mainamatir Gan&quot;) Assamese grammatical peculiarities coexist with features from Bengali language. Though the Gauda-Kamarupa stage is generally accepted and partially supported by recent linguistic research, it has not been fully reconstructed.

===Early Assamese===

A distinctly Assamese literary form appeared first in the 13th-century in the courts of the Kamata kingdom when Hema Sarasvati composed the poem &quot;Prahlāda Carita&quot;. In the 14th-century, Madhava Kandali translated the Ramayana into Assamese (Saptakanda Ramayana) in the court of Mahamanikya, a Kachari king from central Assam. Though the Assamese idiom in these works is fully individualised, some archaic forms and conjunctive particles too are found. This period corresponds to the common stage of proto-Kamta and early Assamese.

The emergence of Sankardev&#x27;s Ekasarana Dharma in the 15th century triggered a revival in language and literature. Sankardev produced many translated works and created new literary forms—&quot;Borgeets&quot; (songs), &quot;Ankia Naat&quot; (one-act plays)—infusing them with Brajavali idioms; and these were sustained by his followers Madhavdev and others in the 15th and subsequent centuries. In these writings the 13th/14th-century archaic forms are no longer found. Sankardev pioneered a prose-style of writing in the &quot;Ankia Naat&quot;. This was further developed by Bhattadeva who translated the Bhagavata Purana and Bhagavad Gita into Assamese prose. Bhattadev&#x27;s prose was classical and restrained, with a high usage of Sanskrit forms and expressions in an Assamese syntax; and though subsequent authors tried to follow this style, it soon fell into disuse. In this writing the first person future tense ending &quot;-m&quot; (&quot;korim&quot;: &quot;will do&quot;; &quot;kham&quot;: &quot;will eat&quot;) is seen for the first time.

===Middle Assamese===
The language moved to the court of the Ahom kingdom in the seventeenth century, where it became the state language. In parallel, the proselytising Ekasarana dharma converted many Bodo-Kachari peoples and there emerged many new Assamese speakers who were speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages. This period saw the emergence of different styles of secular prose in medicine, astrology, arithmetic, dance, music, besides religious biographies and the archaic prose of magical charms.

Most importantly this was also when Assamese developed a standardised prose in the Buranjis—documents related to the Ahom state dealing with diplomatic writings, administrative records and general history. The language of the Buranjis is nearly modern with some minor differences in grammar and with a pre-modern orthography. The Assamese plural suffixes (&quot;-bor&quot;, &quot;-hat&quot;) and the conjunctive participles (&quot;-gai&quot;: &quot;dharile-gai&quot;; &quot;-hi&quot;: &quot;pale-hi&quot;, &quot;baril-hi&quot;) become well established. The Buranjis, dealing with statecraft, was also the vehicle by which Arabic and Persian elements crept into the language in abundance. Due to the influence of the Ahom state the speech in eastern Assam took a homogeneous and standard form. The general schwa deletion that occurs in the final position of words came into use in this period.

===Modern Assamese===
The modern period of Assamese begins with printing—the publication of the Assamese Bible in 1813 from the Serampore Mission Press. But after the British East India Company (EIC) removed the Burmese in 1826 and took complete administrative control of Assam in 1836, it filled administrative positions with people from Bengal, and introduced Bengali language in its offices, schools and courts. The EIC had earlier promoted the development of Bengali to replace Persian, the language of administration in Mughal India, and maintained that Assamese was a dialect of Bengali. 

Amidst this loss of status the American Baptist Mission (ABM) established a press in Sibsagar in 1846 leading to publications of an Assamese periodical (&quot;Orunodoi&quot;), the first Assamese grammar by Nathan Brown (1846), and the first Assamese-English dictionary by Miles Bronson (1863). The ABM argued strongly with the EIC officials in an intense debate in the 1850s to reinstate Assamese. Among the local personalities Anandaram Dhekial Phukan drew up an extensive catalogue of medieval Assamese literature (among other works) and pioneered the effort among the natives to reinstate Assamese in Assam. Though this effort was not immediately successful the administration eventually declared Assamese the official vernacular in 1873 on the eve of Assam becoming a Chief Commissioner&#x27;s Province in 1874.

====Standardisation====
In the extant medieval Assamese manuscripts the orthography was not uniform. The ABM had evolved a phonemic orthography based on a contracted set of characters. Working independently Hemchandra Barua provided an etymological orthography and his etymological dictionary, &quot;Hemkosh&quot;, was published posthumously. He also provided a Sanskritised approach to the language in his &quot;Asamiya Bhaxar Byakaran&quot; (&quot;Grammar of the Assamese Language&quot;) (1859, 1873). Barua&#x27;s approach was adopted by the &quot;Asamiya Bhasa Unnati Sadhini Sabha&quot; (1888, &quot;Assamese Language Development Society&quot;) that emerged in Kolkata among Assamese students led by Lakshminath Bezbaroa. The &quot;Society&quot; published a periodical &quot;Jonaki&quot; and the period of its publication, &quot;Jonaki era&quot;, saw spirited negotiations on language standardisation. What emerged at the end of those negotiations was a standard close to the language of the Buranjis with the Sanskritised orthography of Hemchandra Barua.

As the political and commercial center moved to Guwahati in the mid-twentieth century, of which Dispur the capital of Assam is a suburb and which is situated at the border between the western and central dialect speaking regions, standard Assamese used in media and communications today is a neutral blend of the eastern variety without its distinctive features. This core is further embellished with Goalpariya and Kamrupi idioms and forms.

== Geographical distribution ==
Assamese is native to Assam. It is also spoken in states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Nagaland. The Bengali-Assamese script can be found in of present-day Burma. The Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal also has inscriptions in Bengali-Assamese showing its influence in the past.

There is a significant Assamese-speaking diaspora worldwide.

===Official status===
Assamese is the official language of Assam, and one of the 22 official languages recognised by the Republic of India. The Assam Secretariat functions in Assamese.

==Phonology==
The Assamese phonemic inventory consists of eight vowels, ten diphthongs, and twenty-three consonants (including two semivowels).



=== Consonant clusters ===
===Alveolar stops===
The Assamese phoneme inventory is unique in the group of Indo-Aryan languages as it lacks a dental-retroflex distinction among the coronal stops as well as the lack of postalveolar affricates and fricatives. Historically, the dental and retroflex series merged into alveolar stops. This makes Assamese resemble non-Indic languages of Northeast India (such as Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages). The only other language to have fronted retroflex stops into alveolars is the closely related group of eastern dialects of Bengali (although a contrast with dental stops remains in those dialects). is normally realised as or .

===Voiceless velar fricative===
Assamese is unusual among Eastern Indo-Aryan languages for the presence of (realised as or , depending on the speaker and speech register), due historically to the MIA sibilants&#x27; lenition to (initially) and (non-initially). The use of the voiceless velar fricative is heavy in the eastern Assamese dialects and decreases progressively to the west—from Kamrupi to eastern Goalparia, and disappears completely in western Goalpariya. The change of to and then to has been attributed to Tibeto-Burman influence by Suniti Kumar Chatterjee.

In some cases, can even merge with or (&quot;akhɔr&quot; → &quot;axɔr&quot; &quot;a letter (of an alphabet)&quot;).

===Velar nasal===
Assamese, Odia, and Bengali, in contrast to other Indo-Aryan languages, use the velar nasal (the English &quot;ng&quot; in &quot;sing&quot;) extensively. While in many languages, the velar nasal is commonly restricted to preceding velar sounds, in Assamese it can occur intervocalically. This is another feature it shares with other languages of Northeast India, though in Assamese the velar nasal never occurs word-initially.

===Vowel inventory===
Eastern Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Sylheti, and Odia do not have a vowel length distinction, but have a wide set of back rounded vowels. In the case of Assamese, there are four back rounded vowels that contrast phonemically, as demonstrated by the minimal set: &quot;kola&quot; (&#x27;deaf&#x27;), &quot;kóla&quot; (&#x27;black&#x27;), &quot;kwla&quot; (&#x27;lap&#x27;), and &quot;kula&quot; (&#x27;winnowing fan&#x27;). The near-close near-back rounded vowel is unique in this branch of the language family. But in lower Assam, ও is pronounced the same as অ&#x27; (ó): compare &quot;kwla&quot; and &quot;mwr&quot; .

===Vowel harmony===
Assamese has vowel harmony. The vowels [i] and [u] cause the preceding mid vowels and the high back vowels to change to [e] and [o] and [u] respectively. Assamese is one of the few languages spoken in India which exhibit a systematic process of vowel harmony.

===Schwa deletion===
The inherent vowel in standard Assamese, //, follows deletion rules analogous to &quot;schwa deletion&quot; in other Indian languages. Assamese follows a slightly different set of &quot;schwa deletion&quot; rules for its modern standard and early varieties. In the modern standard // is generally deleted in the final position unless it is (1) /w/ (); or (2) /j/ () after higher vowels like /i/ () or /u/ (); though there are a few additional exceptions. The rule for deleting the final // was not followed in Early Assamese.

The initial // is never deleted.

==Writing system==

Modern Assamese uses the Assamese alphabet. In medieval times, the script came in three varieties: &quot;Bamuniya&quot;, &quot;Garhgaya&quot;, and &quot;Kaitheli/Lakhari&quot;, which developed from the Kamarupi script. It very closely resembles the Mithilakshar script of the Maithili language, as well as the Bengali alphabet. There is a strong literary tradition from early times. Examples can be seen in edicts, land grants and copper plates of medieval kings. Assam had its own manuscript writing system on the bark of the &quot;saanchi&quot; tree in which religious texts and chronicles were written, as opposed to the pan-Indian system of Palm leaf manuscript writing. The present-day spellings in Assamese are not necessarily phonetic. &quot;Hemkosh&quot; ( ), the second Assamese dictionary, introduced spellings based on Sanskrit, which are now the standard.

Assamese has also historically been written using the Arabic script by Assamese Muslims. One example is &quot;Tariqul Haq Fi Bayane Nurul Haq&quot; by Zulqad Ali (1796–1891) of Sivasagar, which is one of the oldest works in modern Assamese prose.

In the early 1970s, it was agreed upon that the Roman script was to be the standard writing system for Nagamese Creole. In January 2020, the Assam government announced that Assamese would be a mandatory language for government job eligibility.

=== Sample text ===

The following is a portion from the story &quot;Silonir ziekor xadhu (The tale of the kite&#x27;s daughter)&quot;, written by Lakshminath Bezbaruah in his book Burhi Aair Xadhu:

==Morphology and grammar==

The Assamese language has the following characteristic morphological features:
* Gender and number are not grammatically marked.
* There is a lexical distinction of gender in the third person pronoun.
* Transitive verbs are distinguished from intransitive.
* The agentive case is overtly marked as distinct from the accusative.
* Kinship nouns are inflected for personal pronominal possession.
* Adverbs can be derived from the verb roots.
* A passive construction may be employed idiomatically.

===Negation process===
Verbs in Assamese are negated by adding before the verb, with picking up the initial vowel of the verb. For example:
* &#x27;do(es) not want&#x27; (1st, 2nd and 3rd persons)
* &#x27;will not write&#x27; (1st person)
* &#x27;will not nibble&#x27; (1st person)
* &#x27;does not count&#x27; (3rd person)
* &#x27;do not do&#x27; (2nd person)

===Classifiers===
Assamese has a large collection of classifiers, which are used extensively for different kinds of objects, acquired from the Sino-Tibetan languages. A few examples of the most extensive and elaborate use of classifiers are given below:
*&quot;zɔn&quot; is used to signify a person, male with some amount of respect
**E.g., manuh-&quot;zɔn&quot; – &quot;the man&quot;
*&quot;zɔni&quot; (female) is used after a noun or pronoun to indicate human beings
**E.g., manuh-&quot;zɔni&quot; – &quot;the woman&quot;
*&quot;zɔni&quot; is also used to express the non-human feminine
**E.g., sɔɹai &quot;zɔni&quot; – &quot;the bird&quot;, pɔɹuwa-&quot;zɔni&quot; – &quot;the ant&quot;
*&quot;zɔna&quot; and &quot;gɔɹaki&quot; are used to express high respect for both man and woman
**E.g., kɔbi-&quot;zɔna&quot; – &quot;the poet&quot;, gʊxaɪ-&quot;zɔna&quot; – &quot;the goddess&quot;, rastrapati-&quot;gɔɹaki&quot; – &quot;the president&quot;, tiɹʊta-&quot;gɔɹaki&quot; – &quot;the woman&quot;
*&quot;tʊ&quot; has three forms: tʊ, ta, ti
**(a) tʊ: is used to specify something, although the case of someone, e.g., loɹa-&quot;tʊ&quot; – &quot;the particular boy&quot;, is impolite
**(b) ta: is used only after numerals, e.g., ɛ&quot;ta&quot;, du&quot;ta&quot;, tini&quot;ta&quot; – &quot;one, two, three&quot;
**(c) ti: is the diminutive form, e.g., kesua-&quot;ti&quot; – &quot;the infant, besides expressing more affection or attachment to
*&quot;kɔsa&quot;, &quot;mɔtʰa&quot; and &quot;taɹ&quot; are used for things in bunches
**E.g., sabi-&quot;kɔsa&quot; – &quot;the bunch of key&quot;, saul-&quot;mɔtʰa&quot; – &quot;a handful of rice&quot;, suli-&quot;taɹi&quot; or suli &quot;kɔsa&quot; – &quot;the bunch of hair&quot;
*dal, dali, are used after nouns to indicate something long but round and solid
**E.g., bãʱ-&quot;dal&quot; – &quot;the bamboo&quot;, katʰ-&quot;dal&quot; – &quot;the piece of wood&quot;, bãʱ-&quot;dali&quot; – &quot;the piece of bamboo&quot;

In Assamese, classifiers are generally used in the &quot;numeral + classifier + noun&quot; (e.g. ejon manuh &#x27;one man&#x27;) or the &quot;noun + numeral + classifier&quot; (e.g. manuh ejon &#x27;one man&#x27;) forms.

===Nominalization===
Most verbs can be converted into nouns by the addition of the suffix . For example, (&#x27;to eat&#x27;) can be converted to khaon (&#x27;good eating&#x27;).

===Grammatical cases===
Assamese has 8 grammatical cases:

===Pronouns===

m=&quot;male&quot;, f=&quot;female&quot;, n=&quot;neuter.&quot;, *=&quot;the person or object is near.&quot;, **=&quot;the person or object is far.&quot;, v =&quot;very familiar, inferior&quot;, f=&quot;familiar&quot;, p=&quot;polite&quot;, e=&quot;ergative form&quot;.

===Tense===
With consonant ending verb likh (write) and vowel ending verb kha (eat, drink, consume).

For different types of verbs.

===Relationship suffixes===
==Dialects==
===Regional dialects===
The language has quite a few regional variations. Banikanta Kakati identified two broad dialects which he named (1) Eastern and (2) Western dialects, of which the eastern dialect is homogeneous, and prevalent to the east of Guwahati, and the western dialect is heterogeneous. However, recent linguistic studies have identified four dialect groups and one dialect isolate listed below from east to west to south:
* Eastern group in and around the undivided Sivasagar district (Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Charaideo and Sivasagar) and the former undivided Lakhimpur district (Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Lakhimpur and Dhemaji. Standard Assamese is based on the Eastern group.
* Central group spoken in Nagaon, Sonitpur, Morigaon districts and adjoining areas
* Kamrupi group in the Kamrup region: (Barpetia, Nalbariya, Palasbaria)
* Goalpariya group in the Goalpara region: (Ghulliya, Jharuwa, Caruwa)
* Cachar dialect (Dehan) in Cachar district of Barak valley

===Samples===
Collected from the book, &quot;Assamese – Its formation and development&quot;. The text below is from the Parable of the Prodigal Son. The translations are of different versions of the English translations:

===Non-regional dialects===
Assamese does not have many caste- or occupation-based dialects. In the nineteenth century, the Eastern dialect became the standard dialect because it witnessed more literary activity and it was more uniform from east of Guwahati to Sadiya, whereas the western dialects were more heterogeneous. Since the nineteenth century, the center of literary activity (as well as of politics and commerce) has shifted to Guwahati; as a result, the standard dialect has evolved considerably away from the largely rural Eastern dialects and has become more urban and acquired western dialectal elements. Most literary activity takes place in this dialect, and is often called the &quot;likhito-bhaxa&quot;, though regional dialects are often used in novels and other creative works.

In addition to the regional variants, sub-regional, community-based dialects are also prevalent, namely:
* Standard dialect influenced by surrounding centers.
* &quot;Bhakatiya&quot; dialect highly polite, a sattra-based dialect with a different set of nominals, pronominals, and verbal forms, as well as a preference for euphemism; indirect and passive expressions. Some of these features are used in the standard dialect on very formal occasions.
* The fisherman community has a dialect that is used in the central and eastern region.
* The astrologer community of Darrang district has a dialect called &quot;thar&quot; that is coded and secretive. The &quot;ratikhowa&quot; and &quot;bhitarpanthiya&quot; secretive cult-based Vaisnava groups too have their own dialects.
* The Muslim community have their own dialectal preference, with their own kinship, custom, and religious terms, with those in east Assam having distinct phonetic features.
* The urban adolescent and youth communities (for example, Guwahati) have exotic, hybrid and local slangs.
* Ethnic speech communities that use Assamese as a second language, often use dialects that are influenced heavily by the pronunciation, intonation, stress, vocabulary and syntax of their respective first languages (&quot;Mising Eastern Assamese&quot;, &quot;Bodo Central Kamrupi&quot;, &quot;Rabha Eastern Goalpariya&quot; etc.). Two independent pidgins/creoles, associated with the Assamese language, are Nagamese (used by Naga groups) and Nefamese (used in Arunachal Pradesh).

==Literature==

There is a growing and strong body of literature in this language. 
The first characteristics of this language are seen in the Charyapadas composed in between the eighth and twelfth centuries. The first examples emerged in writings of court poets in the fourteenth century, the finest example of which is Madhav Kandali&#x27;s Saptakanda Ramayana. The popular ballad in the form of Ojapali is also regarded as well-crafted. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a flourishing of Vaishnavite literature, leading up to the emergence of modern forms of literature in the late nineteenth century.

<doc id="188985" wikidata="Q1629686" url="?curid=188985" title="Lotus Elite">
<text>The Lotus Elite name has been used for two production vehicles and one concept vehicle developed and manufactured by British automobile manufacturer Lotus Cars. The first generation Elite Type 14 was produced from 1957 until 1963 and the second generation model (Type 75 and later Type 83) from 1974 until 1982. The Elite name was also applied to a concept vehicle unveiled in 2010.

==Type 14 (1957–1963)==
The first generation of the Elite or &quot;Lotus Type 14&quot; was a light weight two-seater coupé produced from 1957 until 1963.

The car debuted at the 1957 London Motor Car Show, Earls Court bearing chassis number #1008. The Elite had spent a year in development, aided by &quot;carefully selected racing customers&quot; before going on sale.

The Elite&#x27;s most distinctive feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, in which a stressed-skin Glass reinforced plastic unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car. A steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into the front of the monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, a jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection components. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.

The resultant body was lighter, stiffer, and provided better driver protection in the event of a crash. Still, a full understanding of the engineering qualities of fibreglass-reinforced plastic was several years off and the suspension attachment points were regularly observed to pull out of the fibreglass structure. The weight savings allowed the Elite to achieve sports car like performance from a , Coventry Climax FWE all-aluminium straight-four engine while returning a fuel consumption of . All production Elites were powered by the FWE engine, except for one that acted as testbed for the newly developed Lotus-Ford Twin Cam engine. The FWE engine was derived from a lightweight (FW = Feather Weight) high-capacity water pump engine used for firefighting.

The car had independent suspension all round with transverse wishbones at the front and Chapman struts at the rear. The rear struts were so long, that they poked up in the back and the tops could be seen through the rear window. The Series 2 cars, with Bristol-built bodies, had triangulated trailing radius arms for improved toe-in control. Girling disc brakes, usually without servo assistance, of diameter were used, inboard at the rear. When leaving the factory the Elite was originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 155HR15 tyres.

Advanced aerodynamics also contributed to the car&#x27;s low drag coefficient of considering the engineers did not enjoy the benefits of computer-aided design or wind tunnel testing. The original Elite drawings were by Peter Kirwan-Taylor. Frank Costin (brother of Mike, one of the co founders of Cosworth), at that time Chief Aerodynamic Engineer for the de Havilland Aircraft Company, contributed to the final design.

The SE was introduced in 1960 as a higher-performance variant, featuring twin SU carburettors and fabricated exhaust manifold resulting in engine power output increasing to , ZF gearboxes in place of the standard &quot;cheap and nasty&quot; MG ones, Lucas PL700 headlamps, and a silver coloured roof. The Super 95 model had a more powerful engine with raised compression ratio and a stronger camshaft with five bearings. A limited number of Super 100 and Super 105 cars were made with Weber carburettors, for racing use.

Among the Elite&#x27;s few faults was a resonant vibration at 4,000 rpm (where few drivers remained, on either street or track) and poor quality control, handicapped by an overly low price (resulting in Lotus losing money on every car produced) and, &quot;perhaps the greatest mistake of all&quot;, offering it as a kit (with a substantial reduction in price and Purchase Tax), exactly the opposite of the ideal for a quality manufacturer. Many drive-train parts were highly stressed and required re-greasing at frequent intervals.

When production ended in 1963, 1,030 cars had been built. Other sources indicate that 1,047 were produced.

A road car tested by &quot;The Motor&quot; magazine in 1960 resulted in a top speed of and a 0– acceleration time of 11.4 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1,966 including taxes.

=== Legacy ===
The ownership and history of the more than 1,000 Elites is maintained by the Lotus Elite World Register. There are several active clubs devoted to the Lotus Elite.

===Motor sport===
Like its siblings, the Elite was campaigned in numerous formulae, with particular success at Le Mans and the Nürburgring. The Elite won in its class six times at the 24 hour of Le Mans race as well as two &quot;Index of Thermal Efficiency&quot; wins. Les Leston, driving DAD10, and Graham Warner, driving LOV1, were noted UK Elite racers. In 1961, David Hobbs fitted a Hobbs Mecha-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission to an Elite, and became almost unbeatable in two years&#x27; racing – he won 15 times from 18 starts. New South Wales driver Leo Geoghegan won the 1960 Australian GT Championship at the wheel of a Lotus Elite. After winning &quot;Index of Thermal Efficiency&quot; prize, Lotus decided to go for an outright win at Le Mans in 1960. They built a one-off Elite, called the LX, with a FPF engine, larger wheels, and other modifications. In testing, it proved capable of a top speed of . Unfortunately, the lead driver withdrew the night before the race, so the car did not have a chance to prove itself in competition.
==Types 75 and 83 (1974–1982)==
From 1974 to 1982, Lotus produced the considerably larger four-seat &quot;Type 75&quot; and later &quot;Type 83&quot; Elite. With this design Lotus sought to position itself upmarket and move away from its kit-car past. The Elite was announced in May 1974. It replaced the ageing Lotus Elan Plus 2.

The Elite has a shooting brake body style, with a glass rear hatch opening into the luggage compartment. The Elite&#x27;s fibreglass bodyshell was mounted on a steel backbone chassis evolved from the Elan and Europa. It had 4-wheel independent suspension using coil springs. The Elite was the first Lotus automobile to use the aluminium-block 4-valve, DOHC, four-cylinder Type 907 engine that displaced and was rated at . With this engine the car does in 8.1 seconds and reaches a top speed of . (The 907 engine had previously been used in Jensen-Healeys.) The 907 engine ultimately became the foundation for the 2.0 L and 2.2 L Esprit power-plants, the naturally aspirated 912 and the turbocharged 910. The Elite was fitted with a 4 or 5-speed manual transmission depending on the customer specifications. Beginning in January 1976, an automatic transmission was optional.

The Elite had a claimed drag co-efficient of 0.30 and at the time of launch, it was the world&#x27;s most expensive four-cylinder car. The Elite&#x27;s striking shape was designed by Oliver Winterbottom. He is quoted as saying that the basic chassis and suspension layout were designed by Colin Chapman, making the Elite and its sister design the Eclat the last Lotus road cars to have significant design input from Chapman himself.

The Elite was available in four main variations, set apart by equipment levels: 501, 502, 503, and later on 504. 

* 501 - &quot;Base&quot; version.
* 502 - Added air-conditioning to the base model.
* 503 - Added air-conditioning and power-steering.
* 504 - Added air-conditioning, power-steering and automatic transmission.

The Elite was the basis for the Eclat, and the later Excel 2+2 coupés.

Although larger and more luxurious than previous Lotus road cars, the Elite and Éclat are relatively light, with kerb weights not much over .

In 1980 the Type 75 was replaced by the Type 83, also called the Elite Mark 2. This version received a larger Lotus 912 engine. The chassis was now galvanised steel and the five speed BMC gearbox was replaced by a Getrag Type 265 unit. The vacuum-operated headlights of the earlier model were replaced with electrically operated units and the Elite was now fitted with a front spoiler, a new rear bumper and brake lights from the Rover SD1. 


==Elite concept==
On 20 September 2010, Lotus unveiled photos of an Elite concept that was exhibited at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The car was expected to go into production in 2014.

The car was to feature a 5.0-litre V8 engine sourced from Lexus, rated at . The car would have a front-mid engine layout to distribute weight evenly at all four wheels. An optional hybrid kinetic-energy recovery system would augment the V8 by feeding electricity generated by braking to motors in the transmission. The 0– time was reported to be as low as 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of .

The car had a 2+2 body style and was to be marketed as a grand tourer.

The Elite project was cancelled in July 2012 after a take over of Lotus&#x27; then parent company Proton by DRB-Hicom which initiated a new cost effective business plan.

<text>The Minack Theatre () is an open-air theatre, constructed above a gully with a rocky granite outcrop jutting into the sea. The theatre is at Porthcurno, from Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall, England. The Minack&#x27;s performing season runs from Easter to the end of October and includes a wide range of music and theatre. Each year, the Minack produces several professional productions as well as hosting visiting companies. It has appeared in many lists of the world&#x27;s most spectacular theatres.

The theatre was the brainchild of Rowena Cade, who moved to Cornwall after the First World War and built a house for herself and her mother on land at Minack Point for £100. Her sister was the feminist dystopian author Katharine Burdekin, who lived with them from the 1920s. In 1929, Rowena Cade became involved with a local village group of players who staged Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in a nearby meadow at Crean, repeating the production the next year. They decided that their next production would be &quot;The Tempest&quot; and Miss Cade offered her cliff garden as a suitable location for the play. Miss Cade and her gardener, Billy Rawlings, made a terrace and rough seating, hauling materials down from the house or up via the winding path from the beach below. In 1932, &quot;The Tempest&quot; was performed with the sea as a dramatic backdrop, to great success. Miss Cade resolved to improve the theatre, working over the course of the winter months each year (with the help of Billy Rawlings, Charles and Thomas Angove and other friends), to create the theatre that exists today. She was still working on it well into her 80s. Rowena Cade died in 1983 shortly before her 90th birthday.

In 1944, the theatre was used as a location for the Gainsborough Studios film &quot;Love Story&quot;, starring Stewart Granger and Margaret Lockwood but inclement weather forced them to retreat to a studio mock-up. In 1955, the first dressing rooms were built. In the 1970s, the theatre was managed by Lawrence Shove. Since 1976 the theatre has been registered as a charitable trust and is now a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO).

The theatre is open for visitors throughout the year though visiting days are limited in the winter. The 90th anniversary of the Minack was celebrated with a production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; performed by Hertfordshire Players in August 2022.

<text>TVR Electric Vehicles Limited is a British manufacturer of sports cars. The company manufactures lightweight sports cars with powerful engines and was, at one time, the third-largest specialised sports car manufacturer in the world, offering a diverse range of coupés and convertibles.

==History==
The abbreviation TVR stems from the name of the company&#x27;s owner Trevor Wilkinson, his first garage sporting the letters T, V, and R.
The history of TVR can be divided into several eras, each of which is associated with the company&#x27;s owner at the start of that period:

* 1946–1965, founder Trevor Wilkinson, who left in 1962
* 1965–1981, Martin Lilley
* 1981–2004, Peter Wheeler
* 2004–2013, Nikolay Smolensky
* 2013–present, syndicate of British businessmen led by Les Edgar

===Wilkinson era===
====Founding====
Trevor Wilkinson (14 May 1923 – 6 June 2008) was born in Blackpool and left school at 14 to start an engineering apprenticeship at a local garage.

In 1946, he purchased an old wheelwright&#x27;s workshop in Beverley Grove, Blackpool, to start an engineering business that he named Trevcar Motors. Initially, the company performed general engineering work (not always automobile related), and would also refresh and service cars and trucks. In 1947, local auto enthusiast Jack Pickard joined the company. Trevcar Motors was subsequently renamed to TVR Engineering (dropping several letters from Wilkinson&#x27;s first name), and it continued to find general mechanical engineering work through the following years.

====One-off specials: TVR One, Two, and Three (1949–1953)====
In 1949, TVR built its first original chassis. The Hotchkis-style rear suspension used the live axle from a Morris Eight, and the front suspension was of an independent trailing-arm design. The engine was a Ford 1,172 cc sidevalve from a 1936 van, tuned to 35 hp. Even before the car was bodied, it was crashed by the man hired to create the bodywork, Les Dale. After repairs, the body was styled and built from aluminium, and painted British racing green. Although neither Wilkinson nor Pickard found the finished bodywork to be very aesthetically appealing, it was functional, and the two men conducted the first successful test drive on the runway at Squires Gate aerodrome in 1949. Later that year, TVR Number One was sold to Wilkinson&#x27;s cousin for £325. It was later crashed and salvaged for parts.

TVR Number Two began with the same chassis design found on the first car, using the rear axle, springs, dampers, brakes, and steering from the Morris Eight, as well as the same sidevalve Ford engine. However, the front suspension design was changed to use wishbone control arms and a single transverse leaf spring. The bodywork was again constructed by Les Dale, and it was similar in appearance to the first car. An auto enthusiast local to Blackpool purchased the car for use in competition, although it was eventually registered for road use in 1952. Around this time, the car was refreshed: it received a new body style with a lower nose, and some different instrumentation and equipment (including a tachometer from a Supermarine Spitfire and Marchal headlamps from a Delage.)

After the sale of the Number Two car, TVR began work on Number Three, which again used the same chassis and suspension design. Instead of the sidevalve Ford engine, it was fitted with the 1,200 cc 40 hp OHV four-cylinder engine from an Austin A40. This car was painted yellow, and in contrast to the rounded bodywork of the first and second cars, it was styled with a blunt nose and a squarish vertical panel as the grille. Driven by Wilkinson in a number of car club events (such as sprints and hillclimbs) in 1952 and 1953, the car was quick enough to earn several awards. It was during these club events that one David Hives was introduced to the TVR management, and he would become a key TVR employee a decade later. Hives helped set up the production line at Griffith Motors in Syosset, New York.

====Sports (1953–1955)====
In the summer of 1953, Wilkinson and Pickard began working on the design of a new chassis, which was intended to accept the engine, gearbox, and other components from the Austin A40 (including the independent coil-spring front suspension and rear axle.) Significantly, it did not incorporate an upper body frame, and the engineers intended to provide the car for sale as a kit with a fiberglass body. Approximately twenty; these three cars used an RGS Atalanta body manufactured by special builder Richard G. Shattock. With the Atalanta body included in the kit, the car was named the &quot;TVR Sports Saloon&quot;. The kit was first offered for sale in 1954 for £650. It was with this car that TVR first produced a brochure to advertise a product: it quoted some figures, such as the car&#x27;s weight and 0- time of 13 seconds. It was also on the Sports Saloon that the first incarnation of TVR&#x27;s badge appeared, designed by a young art student and Wilkinson&#x27;s friend, John Cookson.

The first Sports Saloon was finished in Spring 1954, and Wilkinson first campaigned it in the Morecambe Rally from 21 to 23 May. He used it in a number of other events to increase exposure to TVR&#x27;s products, and would drive the car regularly in competition and on the road over the next eight years.

The chassis built by TVR were all made in accordance with customer specifications, and therefore no two of them left the factory in exactly the same configuration. The extra exposure created by using the Sports Saloon in competition led to potential customers inquiring about the availability of other body styles. TVR sold kits with Microplas Mistal bodies, and at least two different styles from Rochdale Motor Panels &amp; Engineering Ltd. The engines fitted were typically the Ford sidevalve or Austin A40 OHV engines. There was at least one instance of a car being fitted with the BMC B-Series engine (as fitted to the MG MGA), and one chassis was built to accommodate a customer&#x27;s -litre Lea-Francis engine.

====Ray Saidel and the Jomar====
In 1955, the company started development of new semi-spaceframe chassis with a central backbone. This chassis used outriggers and a steel bulkhead to carry mounting points for doors. In contrast to the earlier chassis, the new design allowed for the seats to be mounted low (six inches from the ground) on either side of the backbone tunnel. The trailing arm suspension from the Volkswagen Beetle was used for both the front and rear suspension, setting the precedent of all-independent suspension for TVRs in the future.

Later in that year, TVR Engineering received a letter (dated 29 August) from Ray Saidel in Manchester, New Hampshire. Saidel was a successful racing driver and owned the Merrimack Street Garage in Manchester. He indicated that he would be interested in purchasing a TVR chassis fitted with a Coventry Climax FWA engine. TVR completed the chassis in May 1956, and it had arrived in New Hampshire by June of that year, where it was given an aluminum body. This car was the first of several to be designated &quot;Jomar Mk2&quot; (the name being derived from Saidel&#x27;s children, Joanna and Marc, and the fact that this generation of the car was the second after the first Dellow-chassis Jomar.)

Around this time, Bernard Williams, a motoring enthusiast who lived in Lytham St Annes, expressed interest in becoming involved in the company. By July 1955, he had been hired as the director of TVR Engineering. Wilkinson and Pickard were amenable to this because of their limited interest in financial and business administration; both were more interested in the chassis and components engineering. With renewed optimism about the future success of TVR, Wilkinson moved operations from the Beverley Grove garage to three buildings at Fielding&#x27;s Industrial Estate in Hoo Hill, Layton, Blackpool. The buildings occupied by TVR Engineering were somewhat in poor state; holes in the glass roof panels admitted snow in the winter.

Even before receiving his first chassis in June, 1956, Saidel had placed orders for two more chassis. TVR Engineering, bolstered by the influx of sales, hired two more employees: Stanley Kilcoyne, a welder, and Josef Mleczek, a general components fitter. In the following years, Mleczek (nicknamed &quot;The Pole&quot;) would become an expert fibreglass laminator, and would ultimately direct operation in TVR&#x27;s body shop. Also around this time, Bernard Williams introduced a wealthy investor named Fred Thomas, who would join TVR as a director.

====Open Sports and Coupe (1956–1958)====
In mid-1956, Wilkinson and Pickard undertook to create the first original TVR body style, which would be fitted on the Jomar-style chassis. The body shape was created with the use of two Microplas Mistral nose sections, one for the bonnet and one (reversed) for the rear. Although never officially named, this car is usually referred to as the TVR Open Sports. The first car, painted red and fitted with a Coventry Climax engine, was tested successfully by Wilkinson at the Aintree Motor Racing Circuit in the summer of 1956. Either three or four TVR Open Sports were built in total, although the true number is not known due to incomplete records. One of the cars was provided to &quot;Autosport Magazine&quot; writer Francis Penn for testing. He drove it at Aintree and described its steering response and grip as &quot;superb&quot;.

To address feedback from customers about the Open Sports lacking daily-use practicality, the designers at TVR created a fixed-head notchback coupe body. This body was fitted to the same semi-spaceframe chassis to create a car that became known as the TVR Coupe. As with previous models, it was offered with the choice of several engines, including the Ford 100E sidevalve, the Coventry Climax FWA, and the MGA engine. When the Ford sidevalve was selected, the customer had the further option of fitting a Shorrock supercharger. One of the Coupes was used by the factory as a demonstrator model, and was driven by Mike Hawthorn.

On 10 January 1958, the TVR Coupe made its first public appearance at H &amp; J Quick Ltd showroom in Manchester, England: &quot;The designers are Mr. Trevor Wilkinson and Mr. Bernard Williams, who run the T.V.R. engineering company at Layton, Blackpool, and who have been making chassis for special car builders for some years. A little over two years ago they were asked by the American racing car enthusiast, Mr. Raymond Saidel, of Manchester, New Hampshire, to design a racing chassis. For twelve months this chassis was tested and improved on tracks in the United States and in the last year a team of six T.V.R.s has been racing regularly in the United States.&quot; &quot;Competition Press&quot; reported: &quot;Jomar has gone into Formula racing, too. The Jomar &quot;monoposto&quot; has been designed by Ray and is built in his Manchester N.H. shop (the sports car chassis are built for him in England).&quot; In 1959, &quot;Motor Sport&quot; reported: &quot;The cars are made in Blackpool and the majority of the production is exported to America, where the sports version is known as the Jomar.&quot;

Ray Saidel, enthusiastic about the prospect of selling TVRs in the United States, purchased several cars in addition to the rolling chassis that he had bought previously; he imported one Open Sports and three Coupes, with the intention of selling them under the Jomar name. He was not especially successful in selling the cars, and felt that one problem lay in the car&#x27;s styling. Saidel wrote to the factory and suggested that the next model be styled as a fastback.

====Introduction of the Grantura====

The next model produced by TVR was the Grantura Mark 1, which used a fastback-style body over the existing chassis design (with the same trailing-arm independent suspension front and rear.) Engine options included the Ford 100E sidevalve (normally aspirated or supercharged), the Ford 105E OHV unit, two different Coventry Climax units, or the MGA&#x27;s BMC B-series. The interior of the Grantura was cramped, with the short doors and 17&quot;-diameter steering wheel making it difficult to enter and exit the car. Climax-powered cars would be finished with a leather interior, while cars with the lower-specification engines were trimmed with vinyl.

The TVR factory sent the first Mk1 cars to Ray Saidel in the United States, where they would be offered for sale as the &quot;Jomar Coupe&quot; or the &quot;Jomar Gran Turismo Coupe&quot;, depending on which engine had been fitted. Some of these cars carried both the &quot;Jomar&quot; and &quot;TVR&quot; badging on the nose.

A 1958 advertisement from Saidel Sports-Racing Cars offered two models. The Jomar Mk2 (with fibreglass or aluminum bodywork and the Climax engine) was listed with the copy, &quot;only 930 lbs and &quot;Outhandles Everything.&quot;&quot; The second model, the Jomar Coupe, a . fixed-head sports car. These cars utilised the same chassis. In 1959, &quot;Motor Sport&quot; reported:

The JOMAR COUPE is the result of a joint Anglo-American project. The firm of T.V.R. Engineering of Blackpool, England is responsible for the basic-designing and building of the JOMAR chassis upon which in 1956 and 1957 Saidel Sports-Racing cars of Manchester, New Hampshire, using aluminum bodies of their own design carried out extensive research and development. Through the efforts of both concerns the successful MK2 was evolved.

Before the name &quot;Grantura&quot; was selected, some alternatives were briefly considered. A model name of &quot;Trevor&quot; was rejected, as was the suggestion of &quot;Hoo Hill Hellcat&quot; (which was proposed by Averil Scott-Moncrieff, the wife of TVR director David &quot;Bunty&quot; Scott-Moncrieff.)

====Layton Sports Cars and Grantura Engineering====
In October 1958, TVR&#x27;s debt with the bank was nearing £10,000. At that point in the year, the factory had completed as few as ten cars, and orders from the United States had almost ceased due to the lack of sales success there. All of this was of little concern to TVR director and financier Fred Thomas, as he had apparently intended to close TVR and use the failure as a tax loss to benefit his own engineering firm. In actuality, the directors decided on 30 October that the company would be dissolved and re-formed as Layton Sports Cars Ltd. When the new company began trading in December 1958, the directors voted to immediately inject £15,000 to expand the workforce and build stocks of car components. In February 1959, a sister company was formed under the name Grantura Engineering Ltd. to avoid incurring the UK&#x27;s Purchase Tax on sales of the cars (which were then still being offered as kits); Purchase Tax would not be applied to kit cars that were purchased from a different company than that which supplied the mechanical components.

TVR received some positive publicity when &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine dedicated three pages in its March 1959 issue to a technical description of the Grantura Mk1. The company continued to struggle with the rate of production, still only able to build about one car per month. With the order backlog having grown to around fifteen cars by the end of March, the board voted to replace Trevor Wilkinson with Henry Moulds as the new production manager. Moulds was a car enthusiast and friend of Bunty Scott-Moncrieff. Wilkinson would remain involved with the company, although his influence had been diminished by the appointment of Moulds as the new manager.

The already-strained relationship with Ray Saidel in New Hampshire was finally broken during negotiations between Saidel and TVR in May 1959. Derek Harris, the TVR chairman, attempted to pressure Saidel into purchasing fifty cars per year (rather than the previously agreed upon twenty-five.) Saidel walked out of the negotiations and made it clear in a letter to the factory, dated 18 June, that he felt TVR&#x27;s expectations to be extremely unrealistic. By July 1959, the situation at TVR was dire; there were significant inconsistencies in pricing and in financial recordkeeping, stocks of components were not being properly managed, the factory did not employ enough skilled workers, and there were serious doubts about the capability of the company&#x27;s leadership.

In an attempt to re-establish a distributor network in the United States, the factory accepted an order for two cars from Continental Motors in Washington, D.C., which also happened to be the North American distributor for the Elva Courier. TVR had to have the cars returned to the UK when Continental Motors was shut down after its owner, Walter R. Dickson, was convicted and jailed for defrauding his bank.

An engineer (and earlier TVR customer) named John Thurner left his position at Rolls-Royce and joined TVR in November 1959, whereupon he was named Technical Director. Thurner&#x27;s experience and enthusiasm were sought to help the company improve the Grantura and to streamline production, and he was given full control of Grantura development. This raised the ire of Wilkinson, who regarded Thurner as a professional competitor and who felt that he was being undermined by the company he originally created.

====Aitchison, Hopton and TVR Cars Ltd.====
By the middle of 1960, the factory employed forty-three workers, the Grantura Mk1 production was ending (with a total of 100 cars produced), and the Mk2 body shell design was nearly ready. TVR had distributors selling cars in the UK, including David Buxton Ltd. in Derby and Bill Last in Woodbridge, Suffolk. In January 1961, Keith Aitchison and Bryan Hopton (of the Aitchison-Hopton Lotus/TVR dealer in Chester) expressed interest in investing in TVR. During the Summer, Bernard Williams attempted to cement their interest by offering a Climax-powered Grantura Mk2 to the two men for a drive to the Monza circuit in Italy. During the trip, a portion of the exhaust system fell off the car on two separate occasions, but the two men were nonetheless impressed with the car&#x27;s performance.

In September of the same year, the Aitchison-Hopton company bought a controlling share of TVR. Before the end of the year, Hopton had appointed himself as chairman and renamed Layton Sport Cars to TVR Cars Ltd. Between September 1961 and February 1962, the number of orders for cars had been doubled, and most of the stock of finished cars had been sold.

In January 1962, the company hired Ken Richardson as a competition manager, with the intent that he would lead TVR&#x27;s attempts to enter international racing. In March, Hopton entered three Grantura Mk2As in the 12 Hours of Sebring. The lightweight cars were prepared by chief mechanic David Hives and competition mechanic Bob Hallett, although only one of them would actually finish the race (the other two retiring early with mechanical failure.) TVR directors began to doubt the new leadership when they saw Bryan Hopton&#x27;s tendency to overextend the company&#x27;s finances in motor racing, as well as on indulgences such as luxury transport and hotels. This ill-fated race outing at Sebring was the last in a series of events that led to the departure of Trevor Wilkinson, whose resignation was accepted by the board of directors on 5 April 1962.

After both Wilkinson and Pickard left TVR, they together set up a specialist fiberglass engineering business. On retirement, Wilkinson moved to Menorca, Spain, where he died aged 85, on 6 June 2008.

Despite the lack of success at Sebring, the company continued to enter international motor racing events in 1962, including the Dutch Tulip Rally in May, and the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June. The Tulip Rally resulted in one car finishing third in its class, but the Le Mans outing was fraught with unfortunate events for the TVR team. In the time leading up to the race, two of the cars slated to compete were crashed in different incidents and hastily rebuilt. The single car that started the race would badly overheat and retire during the third lap. David Hives described the event as a &quot;fiasco&quot;, and noted that &quot;it cost TVR a small fortune&quot;. TVR cars were driven to greater success by World War II flying ace Tommy Entwistle, who, in 1962 and 1964, finished as runner-up in the Freddie Dixon Challenge Trophy race series. Entwistle won the series in 1963, 1965, and 1966. The car was maintained by David Hives throughout this time. After this racing success, Entwistle stopped racing for a period of time and sold the car to Gerry Sagerman.

By late 1962, the company was again in dire financial trouble. The Mk3 Grantura had been introduced later than expected, two of the home market distributors had gone out of business (Research Garage and David Buxton Ltd.), the Canadian government had imposed a 10% duty on cars imported from the United Kingdom, and the company discontinued its relationship with Dick Monnich, the US importer, because of his failure to pay for his orders. Factory workers were all laid off in October 1962, and Henry Moulds and Bernards Williams met with the company&#x27;s creditors in December. TVR Cars Ltd. moved into receivership and much of its equipment, including body moulds, was moved to secure storage.

Fortunately for the future of TVR, its associated company, Grantura Engineering Ltd., was still in business. Bernard Williams was able to convince the receivers of TVR Cars Ltd. to allow access to the body moulds as well as some partially finished body shells, and several cars were completed in late 1963 and early in 1964. Keith Aitchison again became involved with the company in spring 1963, and remained as marketing and sales director for the following two years. Many of the factory workers and some of the directors were persistent, remaining with the company in an attempt to return TVR to profitability. Early 1963 saw the creation of Grantura Plastics Ltd., a company that handled the fiberglass moulding.

Also in 1963, a new shareholder, Richard Barnaby, initiated talks with Major Tony Rolt of Ferguson Developments over the possibility of developing a four-wheel drive V8-powered TVR. Barnaby asked David Hives to make the chassis for such a car, which he did, although TVR did not have the funds available to commit to such a project in full. It was later revealed that Rolt had been discussing a similar project with Jensen Motors, which ultimately resulted in the Jensen FF.

The company&#x27;s recovery effort brought a partnership with a new distributor, The TVR Centre of Reece Mews, South Kensington, London. Its owner was James Boothby, an ex-RAF pilot.

After re-establishing a distributor partnership with TVR, the American Dick Monnich visited Blackpool and informed the directors that one of his colleagues, Andrew Jackson &quot;Jack&quot; Griffith, was a Ford dealer based on Long Island, and he had been experimenting with installing a Ford 289 engine in a Grantura Mk3 chassis. This car would ultimately become known as the Griffith Series 200.

====The Griffith and 1965 collapse====

In October 1963, Dick Monnich, Jack Griffith, and Griffith&#x27;s race mechanic George Clark finished the prototype of the car named Griffith, developed by fitting a Ford 289 V8 into a Grantura Mk3. The accelerative performance of the car exceeded expectations, although the brakes and chassis had been left unmodified and, by all accounts, were woefully inadequate when matched with the large engine. In a short period of time, David Hives at the Hoo Hill TVR factory built a second prototype that was better developed and better finished, as well as three engine-less cars destined for Griffith&#x27;s business in New York. In March 1964, David Hives went to Long Island to assist Bob Cumberford in building a pattern and plug for the Griffith 600 series, and he also helped set up the production line with George Clark. Hives helped build the &quot;tartan car&quot; that was displayed at the International Automobile Show in New York, which he and Dick Monnich attended. After this, the Griffith factory established in Syosset, Long Island began completing cars from engine-less cars imported from the Hoo Hill TVR factory.

Amidst the Griffith production (which required the TVR factory to build cars at a greater rate than ever before), Major Timothy Knott was hired as the managing director in August 1964. His military background and strict enforcement of order and workday schedule prevented him from ingratiating himself with most of the factory workers. Knott subsequently hired Ralph Kissack, also from a military background, and whose family was involved with Peel Engineering Company on the Isle of Man.

David Hives returned to the TVR factory in England on 1 September 1964. Immediately, he was put onto building the Griffith 400 Series, which involved a lot of work at MIRA (Motor Industry Research Association). It also required working with Armstrong Patents to source the springs and dampers, Janspeed for the exhaust systems, and Kenlowe for the twin fan radiators. After six Months of working on the 400 series, Hives handed the car over to Chris Laurence to finish off development work so that he could concentrate on the upcoming Trident project.

The original TVR logo was designed in 1964 by Bob Hallett and John Baillie. It was subsequently updated in 2018 as part of an updated corporate identity delivered by Forge Design Consultancy, &quot;suitable for both digital and print media - to support their international relaunch.&quot; 

Reliability problems and customer complaints began to mount through 1964. In 1964, a dock strike in the US severely damaged Jack Griffith&#x27;s ability to import cars. Griffith was then unable to meet his financial obligation to Ford, which stopped supplying drivetrain components. Ties with TVR were also then severed, and the already-struggling TVR was no longer able to continue. In September 1964, a director meeting was held at TVR, and it was announced that the company would be stopping production and closing the factory at Hoo Hill. TVR went into liquidation in November of that year.

====Trident====

In 1965, TVR produced four prototypes of a car named the Trident. It was powered by the same Ford V8 as was found in the Griffith, and the body was hand-built of aluminum and steel by Carrozzeria Fissore in Savigliano, Italy. The styling was the work of Trevor Fiore (born Trevor Frost), who borrowed the shape from his previous styling exercise for the Lea Francis Francesa (a conceptual roadster that never reached production).

Carrozzeria Fissore displayed a prototype Trident coupé at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1965. Despite very positive public reaction to the car, it was not well received by Jack Griffith, and the one prototype that had been shipped to the United States was returned to the UK in 1965. When TVR collapsed in 1965, the third and fourth Tridents were under construction at the time, and they were put into storage. In the wake of the company&#x27;s liquidation, TVR dealer Bill Last acquired the rights to the Trident by some means not viewed as legitimate by later TVR management. In 1966, Last established in Trident Cars Ltd and started building the car under the model name &quot;Clipper&quot;.

===Lilley era===
In late 1965, Arthur Lilley and his son Martin Lilley purchased the assets of TVR to mitigate their personal losses of £2,000 worth of TVR shares. TVR Engineering Ltd. was then formed on 30 November 1965, with Arthur as chairman. Arthur approached David Hives and offered him the position of General Manager and Senior Designs and Development Engineer, which David accepted. After two years of this arrangement, Hives asked Arthur Lilley to appoint his son Martin as managing director whilst Hives went to America to talk to Gerry Sagerman about the importation of TVRs. This ultimately resulted in Sagerman establishing TVR Cars of America.

TVR had no outstanding orders to fulfill, and significant outstanding debts towards suppliers. Additionally, members of previous work force had apparently stolen parts and damaged machinery out of spite when they were laid off. In the final days of 1965 and into early 1966, the new workforce gained confidence in management as it became apparent that the Lilleys were genuinely interested in the success of the business. The factory began to ramp up production of the Mk3 1800S. During the period, some partially finished cars were delivered as kits to Martin&#x27;s Barnet Motor Co. car dealer business, where they were finished.

Meanwhile, the company also gained positive publicity as Gerry Marshall had significant success in racing a factory-prepared Griffith. In America, Gerry Sagerman lamented the damage done to the TVR reputation in the US by the poor build quality and poor reliability of Jack Griffith&#x27;s V8-powered cars. After meeting the Lilleys, Sagerman agreed to be involved in importing TVRs to the US. In April 1967, he opened a small showroom and garage in Lynbrook, Long Island, and began importing TVRs as a full-time activity.

Arthur and Martin Lilley were aware that the company&#x27;s future depended on the introduction of new, competitive models. Plans to put the Trident into full production were derailed when the Lilleys discovered that Bill Last had commandeered the rights to that design during the period of confusion between the previous TVR liquidation and the Lilley ownership. TVR engaged Carrozzeria Fissore to build the coachwork for the steel-bodied prototype TVR Tina. David Hives was very heavily involved with the Tina prototype project, and went to Italy with Arthur Lilley to inspect the car. He also accompanied Martin to the 1966 Turin Motor Show. Shortly after this, Hives was dismissed by Martin Lilley for unknown reasons; he was then approached by Bernard Williams and Bill Last to assist in the building of the Trident Clipper.

In January 1967, after production of the Griffith had been discontinued, TVR unveiled the Tuscan V8, initially in short-wheelbase and then long-wheelbase configurations. It was first displayed at the Racing Car Show at Olympia, in London. The Tuscan did not provide the economic boost to TVR that the Lilleys had hoped, and it was only built in low volume. A Tuscan owned by racing driver John Burton was modified by race car mechanic Mike Bigland to improve the handling, and Bigland&#x27;s success was noticed by Martin Lilley; this would be the beginning of a relationship that would be important in the development of the later M Series chassis.

====Introduction of the Vixen====


The TVR Vixen Series 1 was unveiled at the British motor show in October 1967. It proved popular, and generated many new orders for cars. With the launch of the Vixen, TVR transitioned back to making their own fiberglass bodies, rather than depending on Grantura Plastics to build them. Despite the sales success of the Vixen, the company still recorded an overall loss for 1967, and financial advisors began to recommend to Arthur Lilley that the company be shut down. Martin resolved to improve TVR&#x27;s financial fortunes with increased production in 1968.

Around this time, in early 1968, the prospect of putting the TVR Tina into production became infeasible due to the significant expense of building a steel-bodied car. The project was cancelled, with the only two existing Tinas being the two prototype cars. Bill Last also approached TVR and suggested a merger so that TVR Engineering could begin building the Trident in larger volumes. TVR declined this offer.

====New models, nude models and move to Bristol Avenue====
Because the Ford Essex V6 engine had not yet been certified to meet US emissions standards, TVR engaged British Leyland in negotiations to supply either the Rover V8 engine or the 2.5 L Triumph inline six. Extra production for the Rover V8 had already been allocated to Morgan, so the six cylinder Triumph unit was selected.

During Christmas in 1970, TVR moved from its cramped facility at Hoo Hill to a 28,000 square foot Bristol Avenue factory that had been vacated by Nutbrown Ltd., a manufacturer of kitchen utensils. The workforce was enthusiastic about the move, as the Hoo Hill factory had become inadequate for the number of people working and the rate of production, which had risen to between five and eight cars per week.

Between 1969 and 1971, TVR released several new models. The Tuscan V6, equipped with the 3.0 L Ford Essex V6, was intended to fill the performance gap between the four-cylinder Vixens and the V8 models. The long wheelbase widebody Tuscan V8 was built to address the cramped interior dimensions of the car, but was not commercially successful and only a very small number were produced. The Vixen S3 incorporated several minor updates to the Vixen S2, which had continued to be successful. The new 2500 model was fitted with the Triumph 2.5 L inline-six engine. Working together in 1971, Martin Lilley and Mike Bigland developed yet another new model, the TVR 1300. This used the 1.3 L Standard SC engine from the Triumph Spitfire and was intended as an inexpensive model option that was also cheaper to insure.

At the British International Motor Show at Earls Court in 1970, TVR hired model Helen Jones to pose nude on the TVR stand, and the resulting commotion immediately generated more publicity for the company. This advertising technique was used again at the 1971 show, when Helen Jones was accompanied by a second model, Susan Shaw. The reaction was even greater in 1971, and amid the chaos of the public response, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders threatened to ban TVR from the show. This, of course, drew even more attention to the brand. The 1971 show also marked the appearance of the M Series prototype bodywork and the prototype SM estate car.

====SM / Zante concept====
By 1971, TVR wanted to introduce a more luxurious GT car, and they ultimately began to work on a prototype sports estate model. The styling was done by Harris Mann (who would later become known for the Triumph TR7 and Leyland Princess designs), and the engineering by Mike Bigland. The prototype body was built by Specialised Mouldings Ltd. of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire on a TVR 2500 chassis. The car was given the development name &#x27;SM&#x27; and was intended chiefly as a styling exercise with essentially no thought given to fitment of mechanical components or to driver ergonomics. The car appeared at the 1972 British Motor Show as an engineless show car.

After the show, the car was renamed &#x27;Zante&#x27; (after the Greek island) and test driven by both Martin Lilley and Gerry Sagerman in the US. They agreed that the car&#x27;s ergonomics and visibility were not suitable for a road car, and Sagerman further pointed out that it would need a V8 engine to be successful in the US market. Also considering the anticipated development costs for the pop-up headlamps, it was decided the project was not financially viable and the prototype remained the only Zante ever built. The body was removed from the chassis at Sagerman&#x27;s facility and shipped back to Blackpool, where it was stored outside and left to deteriorate.

====M Series====


The TVR model series that would replace the Vixen-based cars was known as the M Series. Mike Bigland would design its chassis, which was superior in every way to the outgoing Vixen chassis; it was more rigid, would provide better safety for the car&#x27;s occupants, and could be produced more economically. Over several months, the design was finalised and the factory prepared for production. The 2500M, 3000M, 1600M, Taimar and 3000S models (as well as turbocharged variants of the V6 cars) were all built for various spans of time between 1972 and 1980. This period saw significant improvements in both efficiency and quality, with Mike Penny performing a quality control inspection on every car that left the factory. Also during M Series production, both Jack Pickard and Stanley Kilcoyne returned to work at the company. TVR had enough faith in the cars&#x27; quality to begin offering a five-year no-corrosion guarantee in 1974. Exports were strong, with sixty per cent of TVR&#x27;s production going to continental Europe and the United States.

On the evening of 3 January 1975, a fire broke out in the TVR factory, likely caused by faulty wiring in a 3000M factory demonstrator car. Several complete and nearly complete cars were destroyed, as well as many components in the company&#x27;s stores. Soot and ash covered every surface, and the damage was estimated to be £200,000. A small team of office workers came in to clean and perform administrative tasks while the insurance company made its assessment. The factory walls were sandblasted to remove the coating of soot, but the sand damaged many pieces of equipment that were not moved out first. Despite the lack of heat and electricity in the building, some limited amount of car construction began again. Four cars were completed in April, and then eight in May. Total production for the year was approximately 150 cars, and only about 20 of those were exported to the US, where Gerry Sagerman&#x27;s business suffered as a result.

In late 1975 and 1976, the newly hired sales manager Stewart Halstead was charged with the task of expanding the home and European markets to stabilise TVR&#x27;s future. Enthusiasm for the cars was high in the US, tempered by the fact that the cars&#x27; pricing had crept up over recent years to the point where the same money could buy a new Corvette. Opportunities continued to expand in Europe, where dealerships opened in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

====Tasmin====


In the late 1970s, TVR&#x27;s leadership felt that the next model should represent a modern departure in styling from the Vixen and M Series cars. It was also important that the replacement model could be economically produced and that it would be easier to bring into compliance with safety and emissions regulations. TVR management met with Oliver Winterbottom in August 1977, and it was decided that he would style a new two-seat coupe. Ian Jones, formerly of Lotus Cars and then of Larkspur Design near Southampton, was to design the chassis. The prototype project initially showed slow progress while it was being worked at the Topolec facility in Norwich, so it was moved to a unit that TVR began renting at Bamber Bridge. The prototype car began road testing in January 1979, powered by the 2.8-litre fuel injected Ford Cologne V6 engine. The name for the car, Tasmin, was created by blending the female name &quot;Tamsin&quot; with the name of the Australasian racing Tasman Series.

During the course of Tasmin development, TVR was short of funds to pay suppliers and this problem was compounded in late 1979 with the short-term loss of £100,000 worth of M Series cars that were impounded by the US federal government for non-compliance with emissions regulations. When the car&#x27;s styling was finalised, it was not especially well received by TVR management (being described later by Martin Lilley and Stewart Halstead respectively as &quot;a big disappointment&quot; and &quot;absolutely dreadful&quot;), but time and budget limitations forced the company to proceed with the design.

After the Tasmin was released in 1980, it did receive a number of positive reviews from motoring journalists who praised its chassis and handling, sales were very lackluster due to the car&#x27;s controversial styling and comparatively high price (£5,000 more than the discontinued Taimar). The car&#x27;s disappointing sales coincided with the early 1980s recession in the UK, and the result was that TVR was again on the brink of financial collapse. In December 1981, Martin Lilley transferred control of the company to wealthy businessman and TVR customer Peter Wheeler.

===Wheeler ownership===

In the 1980s, under the ownership of Peter Wheeler, a chemical engineer who had specialised in manufacturing components for the oil industry and TVR enthusiast, TVR moved away from naturally aspirated and forced induction V6 engines to large V8 engines, namely the Rover V8. In that time, engine capacity grew from 3.5 to 5 litres.
In 1988, TVR sourced a 5.0 litre Holden V8 through Tom Walkinshaw at Holden Special Vehicles. The engine was installed in the TVR White Elephant, a prototype car built for Wheeler by John Ravenscroft. The Holden powered TVR White Elephant was later superseded by the Rover V8 powered Griffith prototype.

With the TVR S Series, first produced in 1986, Wheeler re-introduced the traditional design elements from the M-series. This became a great success for the company, and he followed up by introducing a number of new and bold body designs including the Chimaera, Griffith, Cerbera, Tuscan, Tamora, T350, Typhon and Sagaris.

In the 1990s, TVR modified a number of Rover V8s, but subsequently an in-house engine design was developed. The AJP8 engine, a lightweight alloy V8, was developed by engineering consultant Al Melling along with John Ravenscroft and Peter Wheeler (hence the AJP initials). The new engine was originally destined for the Griffith and Chimaera models, but development took longer than expected and eventually became available in the Cerbera and the Tuscan race car.

Wheeler subsequently directed the design of a straight-six derivative of the AJP8 that would be cheaper to produce and maintain than the eight. This engine, designed initially by Al Melling and then significantly altered before final production by John Ravenscroft of TVR, became known as the TVR Speed Six engine, and, with the exception of the Cerbera (which could be specified with the AJP8), powered all the late model TVRs.

===Smolensky ownership===

In July 2004, Nikolay Smolensky bought the company from Wheeler. Despite his Russian nationality, Smolensky said he intended TVR to remain a British company.

In April 2006, responding to falling demand and with production rumoured to have dropped from 12 cars a week to 3 or 4, TVR laid off 300 of its staff members. At the same time, the firm announced plans to move to updated facilities in the Squires Gate district of Blackpool, citing impending expiry of the lease of the current factory in late 2006, where owner Peter Wheeler was said to be planning to build a housing estate.

In October 2006 Smolensky announced that body production and final assembly for TVR would move to Turin with only engine production remaining in the UK. In protest at this and to show support for the workers, a large number of TVR owners paraded through central London on 26 November 2006. Dubbed &quot;London Thunder&quot;, it was also an attempt at the official world record for the biggest one-marque convoy on record.

By December 2006, it emerged that Smolensky had split TVR into a number of different companies: the brand and intellectual property rights had been transferred to a core Smolensky company; TVR Motors held the licence to the brands and intellectual property in the UK, as well as sales and marketing of the brand; TVR Power - the automotive parts business - had been sold to outside investors; and Blackpool Automotive which held the factory and manufacturing assets.

On 13 December 2006, Smolensky and production director Mike Penny resigned as directors of Blackpool Automotive, being replaced by Smolensky&#x27;s UK personal assistant Roger Billinghurst and 25-year-old Austrian Angelco Stamenkov. By 24 December, Blackpool Automotive was in administration.

On 22 February 2007 it was revealed that Smolensky was once again the owner of the company, having been the highest bidder.

On 8 October 2007, it was realised that Smolensky was still in control of the company and was hoping to restart production, with a target of 2,000 cars to be sold in 2008. and on 11 July TVR announced the relaunching of the Sagaris as the Sagaris 2, at its new centre near Wesham in Lancashire, though this did not happen and the company took no action for another two years.

In June 2010, German manufacturer Gullwing, a specialist German firm which held a minority share in TVR, said they would start producing a new car from September 2010. Boss Juergen Mohr said &quot;Having been a TVR owner, I think this will be the best TVR ever.&quot; He also confirmed the company was planning new models, possibly with alternative drivetrains. &quot;I can imagine everything, even electric-powered cars,&quot; Mohr said.

===Current ownership===
On 6 June 2013, it was reported that Nikolay Smolensky had sold his entire ownership of TVR to TVR Automotive Ltd, a UK company led by Les Edgar and John Chasey.

To coincide with the 2014 Classic Car Show, TVR announced a TVR Genuine Parts initiative to guarantee continuity of supply of parts for classic TVRs and the formation of a new company TVR Parts Ltd which is exclusively licensed to sell genuine parts worldwide, taking over the last stock remaining when the factory closed and the previous TVR parts business operations of Racing Green, Clever Trevor and Multipart Solutions. This was augmented the following year with the purchase of the parts business of David Gerald/Classic World Racing who had held the licence for pre 1980&#x27;s TVRs.

On 3 June 2015, it was revealed that development of the new car had been underway for more than a year, with partners Gordon Murray and Cosworth, that would be launched in 2017, followed by additional models as part of a 10-year plan. The new car boasted an impressive specification, front engined, rear wheel drive, normally aspirated Cosworth V8 mated to a manual transmission, that caused it to be described as &quot;God’s own sports car&quot;. Codenamed T37, deposits were taken in anticipation for delivery in 2017.

Further details of the engine were revealed on 7 October 2015 as being based on the 5.0 L Ford Coyote V8, with modifications by Cosworth including lighter flywheel, dry sump lubrication and unique engine management, to generate from , depending on the variant.

On 22 March 2016, the First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones announced that TVR would build its factory in Ebbw Vale adjacent to the Circuit of Wales, creating 150 jobs, with TVR also receiving an undisclosed investment from the Welsh Government.

On 5 June 2017, it was announced the first public viewing and launch of the car would take place at the Goodwood Revival on 8 September 2017, to coincide with the marque&#x27;s 70th anniversary year. On 8 September 2017, at the Goodwood Revival, the TVR Griffith was unveiled, featuring designwork by Gordon Murray, a 5.0 L Ford Cosworth V8 engine, and a carbon fibre ground effect chassis.

It was announced in January 2018 that the Welsh Government had previously acquired a minority 3% stake in TVR in early 2016, following independent and specialist due diligence, for the sum of £500,000. With this share purchase, it also provided a £2 million repayable commercial loan to the company, alongside a private sector lender, Fiduciam. According to the Welsh Government, the minority stake will &quot;ensure the Welsh tax payer will benefit from the company&#x27;s successes&quot;.

In June 2020, Autocar reported that TVR was owed more than £8.23 million from debtors, and has net assets slightly exceeding £2.1 million. TVR needed to pay off a £2 million loan from the Welsh government and a £3 million loan from financial firm Fiduciam. To fulfill its obligations and put the Griffith into production, TVR launched a £25m bond on Euronext Dublin, Ireland&#x27;s main stock exchange, through Irish firm Audacia Capital. In January 2021, Fiduciam granted TVR a new £2 million loan through the UK&#x27;s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme.

In November 2021 TVR announced a joint venture with Ensorcia Metals a green lithium mining company to both fund production on the Griffith and ensure the supply chain for TVR&#x27;s future battery requirements.

In April 2022, TVR announced that a multi-million pound investment by Ensorcia had taken place and it had repaid the debt owed to the Welsh Government. It was further announced TVR would become a sponsor for the 2021–22 Formula E rounds at Monaco and London to promote the forthcoming second generation of the Griffith.

&quot;Autocar&quot; exclusively revealed in July 2022 that with the support of investment from Ensorcia, in addition to a Griffith EV there were plans for TVR to produce an electric SUV and saloon.

In December 2023, it was reported that TVR had lost exclusive rights to the Ebbw Vale factory. The Welsh Government subsequently offered the facility on the open market, stating that many different companies had shown interest in the facility.

<doc id="188991" wikidata="Q15238516" url="?curid=188991" title="King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford">
<text>King Edward VI Grammar School, or KEGS, is a British grammar school with academy status located in the city of Chelmsford, Essex, England. It takes pupils between the ages of 11 and 18 (school years 7 to 13). For years 7 to 11 the school is boys-only, whereas it is mixed in the sixth form (years 12 and 13). The headteacher is Tom Carter, who was appointed in the autumn of 2014. It was ranked 9th out of all schools in England by the Sunday Times (2025 rankings), and is the 2025 &quot;East Anglia State Secondary School of the Year&quot;.

== History of the school ==
KEGS was one of many grammar schools founded by Edward VI. Its current form resulted from a royal warrant dated 24 March 1551, although evidence of this school exists from as far back as the 13th century, possibly earlier, as a chantry school in a different location in Chelmsford. Indeed, the school of 1551 was merely a &quot;rebranding&quot; of the Chelmsford Chantry School, a Roman Catholic institution which had been abolished along with the monasteries during the English Reformation. The school was moved to its present site on Broomfield Road in 1892. Once a boarding school, it was one of many grammar schools to join the state sector and abolish the nominal fees. The last boarding students left in the 1970s. In 1976 it admitted the first female pupil, Fiona Hook, to the Sixth Form, to study Classics.

The school has been ranked in the top 50 schools in the country in national examination league tables. KEGS was previously a Foundation School and Specialist Science College and Language College. The school converted to academy status in April 2011, but continues to have science and languages as specialisms. It is also a Leading Edge school.

In 1981 it was named by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as the most successful state school as measured by Oxbridge open awards. In 1998, it was rated by the Financial Times as the most successful state school at GCE advanced level in the period 1993-1998. In 2001 the school was named &quot;Sunday Times&quot; School of the Year. The 2015 Good Schools Guide names KEGS as the top selective state school for a number of A-level subjects, as well as GCSE History and FSMQ Additional Mathematics. In December 2021, it was judged to be &quot;outstanding&quot; by OFSTED.

== House system ==
In 1907, headmaster Frank Rogers set up the system of &quot;Houses&quot; – Holland, named for the translator Philemon Holland; Mildmay, for the courtier and politician Sir Walter Mildmay; Strutt, for the antiquary Joseph Strutt; and Tindal, for the lawyer Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, and dividing the school into four forms in each year. Due to the expansion of the school roll over the last few years, this has not been the case. Instead, there are five forms, which contain a mix of people from different houses.

== Extracurricular activities ==

=== Combined Cadet Force and Corps of Drums ===
The school maintains an Army contingent of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF), which was also open to students of Chelmsford County High School for Girls until 2017. Military music is provided within the contingent by a Corps of Drums playing drums, flutes and bugles. The Corps wears the full dress scarlet tunics of The Essex Regiment, incorporating the purple facings which gave the Essex Regiment its nickname &#x27;The Pompadours&#x27;. It carries the drums of the 5th Battalion (Territorial Army) emblazoned with the Regiment&#x27;s battle honours.

<doc id="188997" wikidata="Q3438369" url="?curid=188997" title="Apple Records discography">
<text>This is the discography of [[Apple Records]], a record label formed by the Beatles in 1968. During its early years, the label enjoyed a fair degree of commercial success, most notably with Mary Hopkin and Badfinger, as well as discovering acts such as James Taylor and Billy Preston who would go on to greater success with other labels. However, by the mid-1970s, Apple had become little more than an outlet for the Beatles&#x27; solo recordings (although, as the solo Beatles were actually still under contract to EMI, the Apple label was, in truth, only a cosmetic addition to their releases). After EMI&#x27;s contract with the Beatles ended in 1976, the Apple label was finally wound up. The label was reactivated in the 1990s with many of the original Apple albums being reissued on compact disc, and the company now oversees new Beatles releases such as the &quot;Anthology&quot; and &quot;1&quot; albums as well as the 2009 Beatles remastering programme. In 2010, Apple set about remastering and reissuing its back catalogue for a second time.

For convenience, releases are divided into UK and US releases. However, some releases which were designated a UK-sequence catalogue number were only issued in certain mainland European countries. Additionally, with the Beatles still being under contract to EMI, all of the group&#x27;s records (and the majority of their UK solo releases) retained the numbering systems of Parlophone (for the UK, New Zealand and South Africa), Capitol (for the US) and EMI (for Australia). The Republic of Ireland released eight Apple singles in 1970–71, six of which had unique catalogue numbers. Since the 2013 takeover of EMI by Universal Music, the titles have yet to be reissued with Universal catalogue numbers and UPCs.

==Singles==

==Albums==

===Zapple Records===

Zapple was a short-lived subsidiary of Apple designed to release spoken word and avant garde recordings.

==Reissues==

===1990s remasters===
Apple began the process of reissuing the back catalogue on compact disc in 1991, with many of the CDs containing bonus tracks. By this time, the releases in the UK and US were virtually identical. This list does not include Beatles or solo albums, which were re-released on compact disc by Parlophone or Capitol.

===2009 remasters===
2009 saw the remastered reissues of the Beatles back catalogue. A worldwide release date of 9 September 2009 (09.09.09) was set to tie in with the release of The Beatles: Rock Band music video game. Replacing the CD editions which had been issued in 1987, all of the original Beatles albums were reissued in new packaging with mini DVD documentaries and, unlike the 1987 issues, the first four albums (&quot;Please Please Me&quot;, &quot;With The Beatles&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot;) were made available on CD in stereo for the first time. Also, the &quot;Past Masters&quot; collection of non-album material was now issued as a double CD set, as opposed to the two separate discs issued in 1988. In addition, two box sets were issued, one containing all 16 remastered stereo albums and a second limited edition box set containing the mono mixes of all the albums up to and including &quot;The Beatles&quot; (the later albums did not receive a separate mono mix). The stereo box also features a DVD &quot;The Mini Documentaries&quot; which contains all the short films that are on the CDs in CD-ROM format.

Although the Apple logo is shown on all the 2009 remasters, the labels on the actual discs are those that appeared on the original LPs. So all the albums from &quot;Please Please Me&quot; through &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; feature a Parlophone label. &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, which was first released in an album version in the US, has a Capitol label. The remaining albums, originally released on Apple, feature the green &quot;A-side&quot; label, excepting &quot;The Beatles&quot; which features the green &quot;A-side&quot; label on disc 1, and the &#x27;white&#x27; (cut apple) &quot;B-side&quot; label on disc 2. For the &quot;Past Masters&quot; double-CD set, the first disc has a Parlophone label, and the second disc a green &quot;A-side&quot; Apple label. The DVD that accompanies &quot;The Beatles in Stereo&quot; box set has a red Apple label (similar to that on the original US &quot;Let It Be&quot; LP).

In late 2010, the compilation albums &quot;1962–1966&quot; and &quot;1967–1970&quot; were issued again, in addition a box set &quot;1962–1970&quot; containing both sets, released in the UK and Europe, and a similar box set released in the US with added photo cards and a stamp. Shortly afterwards, the entire remastered catalogue was finally made available to download on iTunes after years of legal wrangling between the Beatles and Apple Inc.


===2010 remasters===
With the 1990s reissues out of print, many of the original Apple albums were re-released for a second time in new remastered versions in October 2010. These remasters were also made available on iTunes, just a few weeks before the Beatles back catalogue was finally released for download. Several of the iTunes versions included exclusive tracks not available on the standard CD issue, although these tracks were included on a bonus double CD as part of the &quot;Apple Box Set&quot;, which collected all of the remastered albums in one package. All of the 2010 remasters had been previously issued in the 1990s reissue programme apart from a 21-track compilation entitled &quot; Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records &quot; which included a number of single-only tracks which now received their first official release on compact disc.

<text>The Miller–Rabin primality test or Rabin–Miller primality test is a probabilistic primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is likely to be prime, similar to the Fermat primality test and the Solovay–Strassen primality test.

It is of historical significance in the search for a polynomial-time deterministic primality test. Its probabilistic variant remains widely used in practice, as one of the simplest and fastest tests known.

Gary L. Miller discovered the test in 1976. Miller&#x27;s version of the test is deterministic, but its correctness relies on the unproven extended Riemann hypothesis. Michael O. Rabin modified it to obtain an unconditional probabilistic algorithm in 1980.

== Mathematical concepts ==
Similarly to the Fermat and Solovay–Strassen tests, the Miller–Rabin primality test checks whether a specific property, which is known to hold for prime values, holds for the number under testing.

=== Strong probable primes ===
The property is the following. For a given odd integer , let’s write as where &quot;s&quot; is a positive integer and &quot;d&quot; is an odd positive integer. Let’s consider an integer &quot;a&quot;, called a &quot;base&quot;, which is coprime to &quot;n&quot;.
Then, &quot;n&quot; is said to be a strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot; if one of these congruence relations holds:
* formula_1, or
* formula_2 for some .
This simplifies to first checking for formula_3 and then formula_4 for successive values of &quot;r.&quot; For each value of r, the value of the expression may be calculated using the value obtained for the previous value of &quot;r&quot; by squaring under the modulus of &quot;n.&quot;

The idea beneath this test is that when &quot;n&quot; is an odd prime, it passes the test because of two facts:
* by Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, formula_5 (this property alone defines the weaker notion of &quot;probable prime to base a&quot;, on which the Fermat test is based);
* the only square roots of 1 modulo &quot;n&quot; are 1 and −1.

Hence, by contraposition, if &quot;n&quot; is not a strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot;, then &quot;n&quot; is definitely composite, and &quot;a&quot; is called a witness for the compositeness of &quot;n&quot;.

However, this property is not an exact characterization of prime numbers. If &quot;n&quot; is composite, it may nonetheless be a strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot;, in which case it is called a strong pseudoprime, and &quot;a&quot; is a strong liar.

=== Choices of bases ===
No composite number is a strong pseudoprime to all bases at the same time (contrary to the Fermat primality test for which Fermat pseudoprimes to all bases exist: the Carmichael numbers). However no simple way of finding a witness is known. A naïve solution is to try all possible bases, which yields an inefficient deterministic algorithm. The Miller test is a more efficient variant of this (see section &quot;Miller test&quot; below).

Another solution is to pick a base at random. This yields a fast probabilistic test. When &quot;n&quot; is composite, most bases are witnesses, so the test will detect &quot;n&quot; as composite with a reasonably high probability (see section &quot;Accuracy&quot; below). We can quickly reduce the probability of a false positive to an arbitrarily small rate, by combining the outcome of as many independently chosen bases as necessary to achieve the said rate. This is the Miller–Rabin test. There seems to be diminishing returns in trying many bases, because if &quot;n&quot; is a pseudoprime to some base, then it seems more likely to be a pseudoprime to another base.

Note that holds trivially for , because the congruence relation is compatible with exponentiation. And holds trivially for since is odd, for the same reason. That is why random are usually chosen in the interval .

For testing arbitrarily large , choosing bases at random is essential, as we don&#x27;t know the distribution of witnesses and strong liars among the numbers 2, 3, ..., .

However, a pre-selected set of a few small bases guarantees the identification of all composites up to a pre-computed maximum. This maximum is generally quite large compared to the bases. This gives very fast deterministic tests for small enough &quot;n&quot; (see section &quot;Testing against small sets of bases&quot; below).

=== Proofs ===
Here is a proof that, if &quot;n&quot; is a prime, then the only square roots of 1 modulo &quot;n&quot; are 1 and −1.
Here is a proof that, if &quot;n&quot; is an odd prime, then it is a strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot;.
== Example ==
Suppose we wish to determine if formula_6 is prime. We write formula_7, so that we have formula_8. We randomly select a number formula_9 such that formula_10.

Say formula_11:

formula_12

Since formula_13, either 221 is prime, or 174 is a strong liar for 221.
We try another random formula_9, this time choosing formula_15:

formula_16

Hence 137 is a witness for the compositeness of 221, and 174 was in fact a strong liar. Note that this tells us nothing about the factors of 221 (which are 13 and 17). However, the example with 341 in a later section shows how these calculations can sometimes produce a factor of &quot;n&quot;.

For a practical guide to choosing the value of &quot;a&quot;, see Testing against small sets of bases.

== Miller–Rabin test ==
The algorithm can be written in pseudocode as follows. The parameter &quot;k&quot; determines the accuracy of the test. The greater the number of rounds, the more accurate the result.

 Input #1: &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, an odd integer to be tested for primality
 Input #2: &quot;k&quot;, the number of rounds of testing to perform
 Output: “&quot;composite&quot;” if &quot;n&quot; is found to be composite, “&quot;probably prime&quot;” otherwise

 let &quot;s&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;d&quot; odd &gt; 0 such that &quot;n&quot; − 1 = 2&quot;s&quot;&quot;d&quot; # by factoring out powers of 2 from &quot;n&quot; − 1
 repeat &quot;k&quot; times:
 &quot;a&quot; ← random(2, &quot;n&quot; − 2) # &quot;n&quot; is always a probable prime to base 1 and &quot;n&quot; − 1
 &quot;x&quot; ← &quot;a&quot;&quot;d&quot; mod &quot;n&quot;
 repeat &quot;s&quot; times:
 &quot;y&quot; ← &quot;x&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot;
 if &quot;y&quot; = 1 and &quot;x&quot; ≠ 1 and &quot;x&quot; ≠ &quot;n&quot; − 1 then # nontrivial square root of 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;
 return “&quot;composite&quot;”
 &quot;x&quot; ← &quot;y&quot;
 if &quot;y&quot; ≠ 1 then
 return “&quot;composite&quot;”
 return “&quot;probably prime&quot;”

=== Complexity ===
Using repeated squaring, the running time of this algorithm is {{math|O(&quot;k&quot; &quot;n&quot;3)}}, for an &quot;n&quot;-digit number, and &quot;k&quot; is the number of rounds performed; thus this is an efficient, polynomial-time algorithm. FFT-based multiplication, for example the Schönhage–Strassen algorithm, can decrease the running time to {{math|O(&quot;k&quot; &quot;n&quot;2 log &quot;n&quot; log log &quot;n&quot;) {{=}} Õ(&quot;k&quot; &quot;n&quot;2)}}.

=== Accuracy ===
The error made by the primality test is measured by the probability that a composite number is declared probably prime. The more bases &quot;a&quot; are tried, the better the accuracy of the test. It can be shown that if &quot;n&quot; is composite, then at most {{sfrac|1|4}} of the bases &quot;a&quot; are strong liars for &quot;n&quot;. As a consequence, if &quot;n&quot; is composite then running &quot;k&quot; iterations of the Miller–Rabin test will declare &quot;n&quot; probably prime with a probability at most 4−&quot;k&quot;.

This is an improvement over the Solovay–Strassen test, whose worst‐case error bound is 2−&quot;k&quot;. Moreover, the Miller–Rabin test is strictly stronger than the Solovay–Strassen test in the sense that for every composite &quot;n&quot;, the set of strong liars for &quot;n&quot; is a subset of the set of Euler liars for &quot;n&quot;, and for many &quot;n&quot;, the subset is proper.

In addition, for large values of &quot;n&quot;, the probability for a composite number to be declared probably prime is often significantly smaller than 4−&quot;k&quot;. For instance, for most numbers &quot;n&quot;, this probability is bounded by 8−&quot;k&quot;; the proportion of numbers &quot;n&quot; which invalidate this upper bound vanishes as we consider larger values of &quot;n&quot;. Hence the &quot;average&quot; case has a much better accuracy than 4−&quot;k&quot;, a fact which can be exploited for &quot;generating&quot; probable primes (see below). However, such improved error bounds should not be relied upon to &quot;verify&quot; primes whose probability distribution is not controlled, since a cryptographic adversary might send a carefully chosen pseudoprime in order to defeat the primality test.{{efn|
For instance, in 2018, Albrecht et al. were able to construct, for many cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL and GNU GMP, composite numbers that these libraries declared prime, thus demonstrating that they were not implemented with an adversarial context in mind.
In such contexts, only the &quot;worst‐case&quot; error bound of 4−&quot;k&quot; can be relied upon.
The above error measure is the probability for a composite number to be declared as a strong probable prime after &quot;k&quot; rounds of testing; in mathematical words, it is the conditional probability
formula_17
where &quot;P&quot; is the event that the number being tested is prime, and &quot;MRk&quot; is the event that it passes the Miller–Rabin test with &quot;k&quot; rounds. We are often interested instead in the inverse conditional probability formula_18: the probability that a number which has been declared as a strong probable prime is in fact composite. These two probabilities are related by Bayes&#x27; law:

: formula_19

In the last equation, we simplified the expression using the fact that all prime numbers are correctly reported as strong probable primes (the test has no false negative). By dropping the left part of the denominator, we derive a simple upper bound:

: formula_20

Hence this conditional probability is related not only to the error measure discussed above — which is bounded by 4−&quot;k&quot; — but also to the probability distribution of the input number. In the general case, as said earlier, this distribution is controlled by a cryptographic adversary, thus unknown, so we cannot deduce much about formula_18. However, in the case when we use the Miller–Rabin test to &quot;generate&quot; primes (see below), the distribution is chosen by the generator itself, so we can exploit this result.

=== Combining multiple tests ===
Caldwell points out that strong probable prime tests to different bases sometimes provide an additional primality test. Just as the strong test checks for the existence of more than two square roots of 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;, two such tests can sometimes check for the existence of more than two square roots of −1.

Suppose that, in the course of our probable prime tests, we come across two bases &quot;a&quot; and &quot;{{prime|a}}&quot; for which formula_22 with {{nobr|&quot;r&quot;, &quot;{{prime|r}}&quot; ≥ 1}}. This means that we have computed two square roots as part of the testing, and can check whether formula_23. This must always hold if &quot;n&quot; is prime; if not, we have found more than two square roots of −1 and proved that &quot;n&quot; is composite.

This is only possible if &quot;n&quot; ≡ 1 (mod 4), and we pass probable prime tests with two or more bases &quot;a&quot; such that &quot;ad&quot; ≢ ±1 (mod &quot;n&quot;), but it is an inexpensive addition to the basic Miller-Rabin test.

== Deterministic variants ==
=== Miller test ===
The Miller–Rabin algorithm can be made deterministic by trying all possible values of &quot;a&quot; below a certain limit. Taking &quot;n&quot; as the limit would imply {{math|O(&quot;n&quot;)}} trials, hence the running time would be exponential with respect to the size {{math|log &quot;n&quot;}} of the input. To improve the running time, the challenge is then to lower the limit as much as possible while keeping the test reliable.

If the tested number &quot;n&quot; is composite, the strong liars &quot;a&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot; are contained in a proper subgroup of the group (Z/&quot;nZ)*, which means that if we test all &quot;a&quot; from a set which generates (Z/&quot;nZ)*, one of them must lie outside the said subgroup, hence must be a witness for the compositeness of &quot;n&quot;. Assuming the truth of the extended Riemann hypothesis (ERH), it is known that the group is generated by its elements smaller than {{math|O((ln &quot;n&quot;)2)}}, which was already noted by Miller. The constant involved in the Big O notation was reduced to 2 by Eric Bach. This leads to the following primality testing algorithm, known as the Miller test, which is deterministic assuming the ERH:

 Input: &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, an odd integer to be tested for primality
 Output: “&quot;composite&quot;” if &quot;n&quot; is composite, “&quot;prime&quot;” otherwise

 let &quot;s&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;d&quot; odd &gt; 0 such that &quot;n&quot; − 1 = 2&quot;s&quot;&quot;d&quot; # by factoring out powers of 2 from &quot;n&quot; − 1
 for all &quot;a&quot; in the range [2, min(&quot;n&quot; − 2, ⌊2(ln &quot;n&quot;)2⌋)]:
 &quot;x&quot; ← &quot;a&quot;&quot;d&quot; mod &quot;n&quot;
 repeat &quot;s&quot; times:
 &quot;y&quot; ← &quot;x&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot;
 if &quot;y&quot; = 1 and &quot;x&quot; ≠ 1 and &quot;x&quot; ≠ &quot;n&quot; − 1 then # nontrivial square root of 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;
 return “&quot;composite&quot;”
 &quot;x&quot; ← &quot;y&quot;
 if &quot;y&quot; ≠ 1 then
 return “&quot;composite&quot;”
 return “&quot;prime&quot;”

The full power of the generalized Riemann hypothesis is not needed to ensure the correctness of the test: as we deal with subgroups of even index, it suffices to assume the validity of GRH for quadratic Dirichlet characters.

The running time of the algorithm is, in the soft-O notation, {{math|Õ((log &quot;n&quot;)4)}} (using FFT‐based multiplication).

The Miller test is not used in practice. For most purposes, proper use of the probabilistic Miller–Rabin test or the Baillie–PSW primality test gives sufficient confidence while running much faster. It is also slower in practice than commonly used proof methods such as APR-CL and ECPP which give results that do not rely on unproven assumptions. For theoretical purposes requiring a deterministic polynomial time algorithm, it was superseded by the AKS primality test, which also does not rely on unproven assumptions.

=== Testing against small sets of bases ===
When the number &quot;n&quot; to be tested is small, trying all {{math|&quot;a&quot; &lt; 2(ln &quot;n&quot;)2}} is not necessary, as much smaller sets of potential witnesses are known to suffice. For example, Pomerance, Selfridge, Wagstaff and Jaeschke have verified that
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 2,047, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 1,373,653, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2 and 3;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 9,080,191, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 31 and 73;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 25,326,001, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, and 5;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 3,215,031,751, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, and 7;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 4,759,123,141, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 7, and 61;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 1,122,004,669,633, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 13, 23, and 1662803;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 2,152,302,898,747, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 3,474,749,660,383, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13;
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 341,550,071,728,321, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17.
* adding a test with &quot;a&quot; = 19 does not improve the preceding bound.

Using the 2010 work of Feitsma and Galway enumerating all base 2 pseudoprimes up to 264, this was extended (see {{OEIS2C|A014233}}), with the first result later shown using different methods in Jiang and Deng:
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 3,825,123,056,546,413,051, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23.
* adding tests with &quot;a&quot; = 29 and 31 does not improve the preceding bound.
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 264 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.

Sorenson and Webster verify the above and calculate precise results for these larger than 64‐bit results:
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 318,665,857,834,031,151,167,461, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.
* if &quot;n&quot; &lt; 3,317,044,064,679,887,385,961,981, it is enough to test &quot;a&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, and 41.

Other criteria of this sort, often more efficient (fewer bases required) than those shown above, exist. They give very fast deterministic primality tests for numbers in the appropriate range, without any assumptions.

There is a small list of potential witnesses for every possible input size (at most &quot;b&quot; values for &quot;b&quot;‐bit numbers). However, no finite set of bases is sufficient for all composite numbers. Alford, Granville, and Pomerance have shown that there exist infinitely many composite numbers &quot;n&quot; whose smallest compositeness witness is at least {{math|(ln &quot;n&quot;)1/(3ln ln ln &quot;n&quot;)}}. They also argue heuristically that the smallest number &quot;w&quot; such that every composite number below &quot;n&quot; has a compositeness witness less than &quot;w&quot; should be of order {{math|Θ(log &quot;n&quot; log log &quot;n&quot;).}}

== Variants for finding factors ==

By inserting greatest common divisor calculations into the above algorithm, we can sometimes obtain a factor of &quot;n&quot; instead of merely determining that &quot;n&quot; is composite. This occurs for example when &quot;n&quot; is a probable prime to base &quot;a&quot; but not a strong probable prime to base &quot;a&quot;.{{rp|1402}}

If &quot;x&quot; is a nontrivial square root of 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;,
* since {{math|1=&quot;x&quot;2 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;n&quot;)}}, we know that &quot;n&quot; divides {{math|1=&quot;x&quot;2 − 1 = (&quot;x&quot; − 1)(&quot;x&quot; + 1)}};
* since {{math|1=&quot;x&quot; ≢ ±1 (mod &quot;n&quot;)}}, we know that &quot;n&quot; does not divide {{math|1=&quot;x&quot; − 1}} nor {{math|1=&quot;x&quot; + 1}}.

From this we deduce that {{math|1=&quot;A&quot; = gcd(&quot;x&quot; − 1, &quot;n&quot;)}} and {{math|1=&quot;B&quot; = gcd(&quot;x&quot; + 1, &quot;n&quot;)}} are nontrivial (not necessarily prime) factors of &quot;n&quot; (in fact, since &quot;n&quot; is odd, these factors are coprime and &quot;n&quot; = &quot;AB&quot;). Hence, if factoring is a goal, these gcd calculations can be inserted into the algorithm at little additional computational cost. This leads to the following pseudocode, where the added or changed code is highlighted:

 Input #1: &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, an odd integer to be tested for primality
 Input #2: &quot;k&quot;, the number of rounds of testing to perform
 Output: {{font color||yellow|text=(“&quot;multiple of&quot;”, &quot;m&quot;) if a nontrivial factor &quot;m&quot; of &quot;n&quot; is found,}}
 “&quot;composite&quot;” if &quot;n&quot; is otherwise found to be composite,
 “&quot;probably prime&quot;” otherwise

 let &quot;s&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;d&quot; odd &gt; 0 such that &quot;n&quot; − 1 = 2&quot;s&quot;&quot;d&quot; # by factoring out powers of 2 from &quot;n&quot; − 1
 repeat &quot;k&quot; times:
 &quot;a&quot; ← random(2, &quot;n&quot; − 2) # &quot;n&quot; is always a probable prime to base 1 and &quot;n&quot; − 1
 &quot;x&quot; ← &quot;a&quot;&quot;d&quot; mod &quot;n&quot;
 repeat &quot;s&quot; times:
 &quot;y&quot; ← &quot;x&quot;2 mod &quot;n&quot;
 if &quot;y&quot; = 1 and &quot;x&quot; ≠ 1 and &quot;x&quot; ≠ &quot;n&quot; − 1 then # nontrivial square root of 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;
 {{font color||yellow|text=return (“&quot;multiple of&quot;”, gcd(&quot;x&quot; − 1, &quot;n&quot;))}}
 &quot;x&quot; ← &quot;y&quot;
 if &quot;y&quot; ≠ 1 then
 return “&quot;composite&quot;”
 return “&quot;probably prime&quot;”

This is &quot;not&quot; a probabilistic factorization algorithm because it is only able to find factors for numbers &quot;n&quot; which are pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot; (in other words, for numbers &quot;n&quot; such that {{math|1=&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 ≡ 1 mod &quot;n&quot;}}). For other numbers, the algorithm only returns &quot;composite&quot; with no further information.

For example, consider &quot;n&quot; = 341 and &quot;a&quot; = 2. We have {{math|&quot;n&quot; − 1 {{=}} 85 × 4}}. Then {{math|285 mod 341 {{=}} 32}} and {{math|322 mod 341 {{=}} 1}}. This tells us that &quot;n&quot; is a pseudoprime base 2, but not a strong pseudoprime base 2. By computing a gcd at this stage, we find a factor of 341: {{math|gcd(32 − 1, 341) {{=}} 31}}. Indeed, {{math|341 {{=}} 11 × 31}}.

The same technique can be applied to the square roots of any other value, particularly the square roots of −1 mentioned in {{slink||Combining multiple tests}}. If two (successful) strong probable prime tests find {{math|&quot;x&quot;2 ≡ −1 (mod &quot;n&quot;)}} and {{math|&quot;y&quot;2 ≡ −1 (mod &quot;n&quot;)}}, but {{math|&quot;x&quot; ≢ ±&quot;y&quot; (mod &quot;n&quot;)}}, then {{math|gcd(&quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)}} and {{math|gcd(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)}} are nontrivial factors of &quot;n&quot;.

For example, {{math|1=&quot;n&quot; = 46,856,248,255,981}} is a strong pseudoprime to bases 2 and 7, but in the course of performing the tests we find
: formula_24
: formula_25
: formula_26
This gives us the factor {{math|1=gcd(34456063004337 − 21307242304265, &quot;n&quot;) = 4840261}}.

== Generation of probable primes ==
The Miller–Rabin test can be used to generate strong probable primes, simply by drawing integers at random until one passes the test. This algorithm terminates almost surely (since at each iteration there is a chance to draw a prime number). The pseudocode for generating &quot;b&quot;‐bit strong probable primes (with the most significant bit set) is as follows:

 Input #1: &quot;b&quot;, the number of bits of the result
 Input #2: &quot;k&quot;, the number of rounds of testing to perform
 Output: a strong probable prime &quot;n&quot;

 while True:
 pick a random odd integer &quot;n&quot; in the range [2&quot;b&quot;−1, 2&quot;b&quot;−1]
 if the Miller–Rabin test with inputs &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot; returns “&quot;probably prime&quot;” then
 return &quot;n&quot;

=== Complexity ===
Of course the worst-case running time is infinite, since the outer loop may never terminate, but that happens with probability zero. As per the geometric distribution, the expected number of draws is formula_27 (reusing notations from earlier).

As any prime number passes the test, the probability of being prime gives a coarse lower bound to the probability of passing the test. If we draw odd integers uniformly in the range [2&quot;b&quot;−1, 2&quot;b&quot;−1], then we get:

: formula_28

where π is the prime-counting function. Using an asymptotic expansion of π (an extension of the prime number theorem), we can approximate this probability when &quot;b&quot; grows towards infinity. We find:

: formula_29
: formula_30

Hence we can expect the generator to run no more Miller–Rabin tests than a number proportional to &quot;b&quot;. Taking into account the worst-case complexity of each Miller–Rabin test (see earlier), the expected running time of the generator with inputs &quot;b&quot; and &quot;k&quot; is then bounded by {{math|O(&quot;k&quot; &quot;b&quot;4)}} (or {{math|Õ(&quot;k&quot; &quot;b&quot;3)}} using FFT-based multiplication).

=== Accuracy ===
The error measure of this generator is the probability that it outputs a composite number.

Using the relation between conditional probabilities (shown in an earlier section) and the asymptotic behavior of formula_31 (shown just before), this error measure can be given a coarse upper bound:

: formula_32

Hence, for large enough &quot;b&quot;, this error measure is less than formula_33. However, much better bounds exist.

Using the fact that the Miller–Rabin test itself often has an error bound much smaller than 4−&quot;k&quot; (see earlier), Damgård, Landrock and Pomerance derived several error bounds for the generator, with various classes of parameters &quot;b&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. These error bounds allow an implementor to choose a reasonable &quot;k&quot; for a desired accuracy.

One of these error bounds is 4−&quot;k&quot;, which holds for all &quot;b&quot; ≥ 2 (the authors only showed it for &quot;b&quot; ≥ 51, while Ronald Burthe Jr. completed the proof with the remaining values 2 ≤ &quot;b&quot; ≤ 50). Again this simple bound can be improved for large values of &quot;b&quot;. For instance, another bound derived by the same authors is:
: formula_34
which holds for all &quot;b&quot; ≥ 21 and &quot;k&quot; ≥ &quot;b&quot;/4. This bound is smaller than 4−&quot;k&quot; as soon as &quot;b&quot; ≥ 32.

<text>A fire department (North American English) or fire brigade (Commonwealth English), also known as a fire company, fire authority, fire district, fire and rescue, or fire service in some areas, is an organization that provides fire prevention and fire suppression services as well as other rescue services.

Fire departments are most commonly a public sector organization that operate within a municipality, county, state, nation, or special district. Private and specialist firefighting organizations also exist, such as those for aircraft rescue and firefighting.

A fire department contains one or more fire stations within its boundaries, and may be staffed by firefighters, who may be professional, volunteers, conscripts, or on-call. Combination fire departments employ a mix of professional and volunteer firefighters. In some countries, fire departments may also run an ambulance service, staffed by volunteer or professional EMS personnel.

==Organization==

Fire departments are organized in a system of administration, services, training, and operations; for example:

* Administration is responsible for supervision, budgets, policy, and human resources.
* Service offers protection, safety, and education to the public.
* Training prepares people with the knowledge and skills to perform their duties.
* Operations performs tasks to mitigate harm to persons, property, and the environment.
A fire service is normally set up where it can have fire stations, fire engines and other relevant equipment strategically deployed throughout the area it serves, so that dispatchers can send fire engines, fire trucks, or ambulances from the fire stations closest to the incident. Larger departments have branches within themselves to increase efficiency, composed of volunteers, support, and research.

* Volunteers give additional support to the department in a state of emergency.
* Support organizing the resources within and outside of the department.
* Research is to give advantages in new technologies for the department.

===Jurisdiction===

Most places are covered by a public sector fire department, which is established by a local or national government and funded by taxation. Even volunteer fire departments may still receive some government funding.

The typical size of a fire department varies greatly by country. In the United States, firefighting is usually organized on a municipal level. Some municipalities belong to &quot;fire protection districts&quot; that are served by the same fire department, such as the San Ramon Valley Fire Protection District in California. Austria, Germany and Canada also organize fire services at a municipal level. In France, fire services mostly cover one department. In the United Kingdom, most fire services cover one or more counties, while Scotland and Northern Ireland each have a single fire service. In Australia, state governments run the fire services, although three states have separate agencies for metropolitan and rural areas. Poland, the Czech Republic, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, and the Philippines have national fire and rescue services.

===Responsibilities===

Fire departments may also provide other, more specialized emergency services, such as aircraft rescue and firefighting, hazardous materials response, technical rescue, search and rescue, and wildland firefighting.

In some countries or regions (e.g., the United States, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau), fire departments can be responsible for providing emergency medical services. The EMS personnel may either be cross-trained as firefighters or a separate division of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. While some services act only as &quot;first responders&quot; to medical emergencies, stabilizing victims until an ambulance can arrive, other fire services also operate ambulance services.

==History==


===Ancient Rome===
The earliest known firefighting service was formed in Ancient Rome by Marcus Egnatius Rufus who used his slaves to provide a free fire service. These men fought fires using bucket chains and also patrolled the streets with the authority to impose corporal punishment upon those who violated fire-prevention codes. The Emperor Augustus established a public fire department in 24 BCE, composed of 600 slaves distributed amongst seven fire stations in Rome.

===1600s and 1700s===
Fire departments were again formed by property insurance companies beginning in the 17th century after the Great Fire of London in 1666. The first insurance brigades were established the following year. Others began to realize that much money could be made from this practice, and ten more insurance companies set up in London before 1832: The Alliance, Atlas, Globe, Imperial, London, Protector, Royal Exchange, Sun Union and Westminster. Each company had its own fire mark, a durable plaque that would be affixed to the building exterior. Although a popular legend says a company&#x27;s fire brigade would not extinguish a burning building if it did not have the correct fire mark, there is little evidence to support this; evidence shows insurance companies required their firefighters to fight every fire they encountered.

Amsterdam also had a sophisticated firefighting system in the late 17th century, under the direction of artist Jan van der Heyden, who had improved the designs of both fire hoses and fire pumps.

The city of Boston, Massachusetts established America&#x27;s first publicly funded, paid fire department in 1678.

Fire insurance made its debut in the American colonies in South Carolina in 1736, but it was Benjamin Franklin who imported the London model of insurance. He established the colonies&#x27; first fire insurance company in Philadelphia named the Philadelphia Contributionship, as well as its associated Union Volunteer Fire Company, which was an unpaid (volunteer) company.

A document dated in 1686 informs about the payment system of four so called &quot;fire servants&quot; (German: &quot;Feuerknecht&quot;) in Vienna, which is the official founding year of the Vienna Fire Department.

In 1754, Halifax, Nova Scotia established the Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency, which is today Canada&#x27;s oldest fire department.

In 1764, Haddonfield, New Jersey established the second oldest fire company in the United States.

Another early American fire department, staffed by unpaid volunteers, was established in the city of Petersburg, Virginia in 1773.

===1800s===
In the 19th century, cities began to form their own fire departments as a civil service to the public, obliging private fire companies to shut down, many merging their fire stations into the city&#x27;s fire department. In 1833, London&#x27;s ten independent brigades all merged to form the London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE), with James Braidwood as the Chief Officer. Braidwood had previously been the fire chief in Edinburgh, where the world&#x27;s first municipal fire service was founded in 1824, and he is now regarded, along with Van der Heyden, as one of founders of modern firefighting. The LFEE then was incorporated into the city&#x27;s Metropolitan Fire Brigade in 1865 under Eyre Massey Shaw.

In 1879, the University of Notre Dame established the first University-based fire department in the United States.

===1900s===
The first motorized fire department was organized in 1906 in Springfield, Massachusetts, where Knox Automobile had developed the first modern fire engine one year earlier.

<text>Hotel California is the fifth studio album by American rock band Eagles, released on December 8, 1976, by Asylum Records. Recorded by the band and produced by Bill Szymczyk at the Criteria and Record Plant studios between March and October 1976, it was the band&#x27;s first album with guitarist Joe Walsh, who had replaced founding member Bernie Leadon, and the last to feature founding bassist Randy Meisner. The album cover features a photograph of the Beverly Hills Hotel, taken by David Alexander.

&quot;Hotel California&quot; was an immediate critical and commercial success, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. At the 20th Grammy Awards, the title track won Record of the Year, and &quot;New Kid in Town&quot; won Best Arrangement for Voices. The album was also nominated for Album of the Year but lost to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977). Three singles were released from the album, with the title track and &quot;New Kid in Town&quot; topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; reaching No. 11.

&quot;Hotel California&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of all time. It has been certified 26× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the US, and has sold over 32 million units worldwide, making it the band&#x27;s second best-selling album after &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; (1976). Ranked by various publications as one of the greatest albums of all time, it was placed at number 37 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003 and 2012, re-positioned to number 118 in the 2020 edition. A 40th anniversary special edition of &quot;Hotel California&quot; was released in November 2017. The band played the album in its entirety during the Hotel California 2020 Tour.

==Theme==
The first song written for the album was &quot;Hotel California&quot;, which became the theme for the album. Don Henley said of the themes of the songs in the album: 

On the title &quot;Hotel California&quot;, Henley said that &quot;the word, &#x27;California,&#x27; carries with it all kinds of connotations, powerful imagery, mystique, etc., that fires the imaginations of people in all corners of the globe. There&#x27;s a built-in mythology that comes with that word, an American cultural mythology that has been created by both the film and the music industry.&quot; In an interview with the Dutch magazine &quot;ZigZag&quot; shortly before the album&#x27;s release, Henley said: 
==Composition==
Bernie Leadon, who was the principal country influence in the band, left the band after the release of the previous album, &quot;One of These Nights&quot; (1975). For &quot;Hotel California&quot;, the band made a conscious decision to move away from country rock, and wrote some songs with a more straightforward rock &amp; roll sound, such as &quot;Victim of Love&quot; and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;. Leadon was replaced by Joe Walsh who provided the opening guitar riff of &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; that was then developed into the song. The title for &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; was inspired by a conversation between Frey and his drug dealer during a high speed car ride.

The chord progression and basic melody of the title track, &quot;Hotel California&quot;, was written by Don Felder. Don Henley wrote most of the lyrics, with contributions from Glenn Frey. Henley noted that the hotel had become a &quot;literal and symbolic focal point of their lives at that time&quot;, and it became the theme of the song. Frey wanted the song to be &quot;more cinematic&quot;, and to write it &quot;just like it was a movie&quot;. Henley sought inspiration for the lyrics by driving out into the desert, as well as from films and theatre. Parts of the lyrics of &quot;Hotel California&quot; as well as the song &quot;Wasted Time&quot; were based on Henley&#x27;s break up with his then girlfriend Loree Rodkin.

Frey, in the &quot;Hotel California&quot; episode of &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;rb/its/E-HC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; spoke about the writing of &quot;The Last Resort&quot;. Frey said: &quot;It was the first time that Don took it upon himself to write an epic story and we were already starting to worry about the environment… we&#x27;re constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. I mean we&#x27;re putting junk, er, garbage into space now.&quot;

==Recording==
The album was recorded between March and October 1976 at Criteria Studios in Miami and Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, and produced by Bill Szymczyk. Although the band favored Los Angeles, the producer Szymczyk wanted to record in Miami as he had developed a fear of living on a fault line in Los Angeles after experiencing an earthquake, and a compromise was then struck to split the recording between both places. While the band were recording the album, Black Sabbath were recording &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot; in an adjacent studio at Criteria Studios. The band was forced to stop recording on numerous occasions because Black Sabbath were too loud and the sound was coming through the wall. The last track of the album, &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, had to be re-recorded a number of times due to noise from the next studio.

For the title track &quot;Hotel California&quot;, after the arrangement and instrumentation had been refined, several complete takes were recorded. The best parts were then spliced together, in all 33 edits on the two‑inch master, to create the final version. In contrast, &quot;Victim of Love&quot; was recorded in a live session in studio apart from the lead vocal and the harmony on the choruses which were added later. Don Felder initially sang the lead vocals in the many early takes for the song, but the band felt that his efforts were not up to the required standard, and Henley then took over as the lead. Producer Szymczyk claims that the basic tracks for the entire album were recorded in complete takes, but he does not describe how individual songs were recorded (other than the aforementioned &quot;Hotel California&quot; and &quot;Victim of Love&quot;).

According to Henley in a 1982 interview, the Eagles &quot;probably peaked on &quot;Hotel California&quot;.&quot; Henley said: &quot;After that, we started growing apart as collaborators and as friends.&quot;

==Artwork==

The front cover artwork is a photograph of The Beverly Hills Hotel shot just before sunset by David Alexander with design and art direction by Kosh. According to Kosh, Henley wanted him to find a place that can portray the Hotel California of the album title, and &quot;portray it with a slightly sinister edge&quot;. Three hotels were photographed, and the one with The Beverly Hills Hotel was selected as the cover. Both The photographer and Kosh shot the image 60 feet above Sunset Boulevard on top of a cherry picker. As the image was taken from an unfamiliar vantage point in fading light, most people did not initially recognize the hotel. However, when the identity of Beverly Hills Hotel was revealed, the hotel threatened legal action over the use of the image.

The rear album cover was shot in the lobby of the Lido Hotel in Hollywood. The gatefold image shows the same lobby but filled with members of the band and their friends. Henley said: &quot;I wanted a collection of people from all walks of life, It’s people on the edge, on the fringes of society.&quot; A shadowy figure appears on the balcony above the lobby, which led to speculations over the person&#x27;s identity.

Kosh designed a Hotel California logo as a neon sign which was used on the album cover and in its promotional materials. As it proved difficult to bend real neon tubings into the desired shape of the script, the neon effect of the logo was achieved with airbrush by Bob Hickson. Additional portraits of the band used in the album package and promotional materials were shot by Norman Seeff.

==Release==
The album was released by Asylum Records on December 8, 1976, in vinyl, cassette and 8-track cartridge formats. It was considered for quadraphonic release in early 1977, but this idea was dropped following the demise of the quadraphonic format. On the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2001, it was released in a Multichannel 5.1 DVD-Audio disc. On August 17, 2011, the album was released on a hybrid SACD in Japan in The Warner Premium Sound series, containing both a stereo and a 5.1 mix.

Original vinyl pressings of &quot;Hotel California&quot; (Elektra/Asylum catalog no. 7E-1084) had custom picture labels of a blue Hotel California logo with a yellow background. These also had text engraved in the run-out groove of each side, continuing an in-joke trend the band had started with their third album &quot;On the Border&quot;. The text reads: Side one: &quot;Is It 6 O&#x27;Clock Yet?&quot;; Side two: &quot;V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live&quot;, indicating that the song &quot;Victim of Love&quot; was recorded in a live session in studio, with no overdubbing. Joe Walsh and Glenn Frey confirm this on the inner booklet of &quot;The Very Best Of&quot;. This only referred to the instrumental track, however; the lead vocal and harmony for the chorus were added later. This was in response to those who criticized the Eagles&#x27; practice of copious overdubbing of instruments and that they were too clinical and soulless in the studio. They wanted to demonstrate that they could play together without overdubs if they wanted to.

A 40th anniversary deluxe edition was released on November 24, 2017. The set includes the original remastered album, and a second CD that features 10 live tracks from the concert at The Forum, recorded in October 1976 two months before the original release of the album. This bonus CD was also issued as a stand-alone vinyl LP in 2021.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Hotel California&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau felt it was their &quot;most substantial if not their most enjoyable LP&quot;, while Charley Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt it showcased &quot;both the best and worst tendencies of Los Angeles-situated rock&quot;. Both critics picked up on the album&#x27;s California themes – Christgau remarking that while it may in places be &quot;pretentious and condescending&quot; and that &quot;Don Henley is incapable of conveying a mental state as complex as self-criticism&quot;, the band couldn&#x27;t have written the songs on side one &quot;without caring about their California theme down deep&quot;; Walters in contrast felt the &quot;lyrics present a convincing and unflattering portrait of the milieu itself&quot;, and that Don Henley&#x27;s vocals express well &quot;the weary disgust of a victim (or observer) of the region&#x27;s luxurious excess&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; gave the album high praise: &quot;The casually beautiful, quietly-intense multileveled vocal harmonies and brilliant original songs that meld solid emotional words with lovely melody lines are all back in force, keeping the Eagles at the acme of acoustic electric soft rock.&quot; It noted that, even though the album did not try out any new departure other than the &quot;Procol Harum-type&quot; title track, &quot;the album proves that there&#x27;s a lot more left to explore profitably and artistically in the L.A. countryish-rock style.&quot;

Retrospective reviews have also been positive. Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, writing after the band broke up, called the album &quot;a legitimate rock masterpiece&quot;, in which the band &quot;examined their recurring theme about the American Dream with more precision, power and daring than ever in such stark, uncompromising songs as &quot;Hotel California&quot; and &quot;The Last Resort&quot;.&quot; William Ruhlmann from AllMusic later said &quot;&quot;Hotel California&quot; unveiled what seemed almost like a whole new band. It was a band that could be bombastic, but also one that made music worthy of the later tag of &#x27;classic rock&#x27;, music appropriate for the arenas and stadiums the band was playing.&quot; Steve Holtje, writing for &quot;CultureCatch&quot; in 2012, felt that even though &quot;an awful lot of the album is snarky whining from co-leaders Don Henley and Glenn Frey, two guys who didn&#x27;t really seem like they had that much they could legitimately complain about&quot;, in the final analysis &quot;&quot;Hotel California&quot; and the underrated concept album &quot;Desperado&quot; stand as the group&#x27;s greatest statements&quot;.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Sterling Whitaker rated both &quot;Wasted Time&quot; and &quot;The Last Resort&quot; as being among the Eagles&#x27; 10 most underrated songs.

== Accolades ==
&quot;Hotel California&quot; was the Eagles&#x27; sixth album (including &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot;), and fifth of original material. It became a critical and commercial success. In a poll of rock critics and DJs in 1987, it was ranked 48 out of 100. In a public poll for the 1994 edition of &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, it was voted number 107, and then number 67 in the 2000 edition. In 2001, the TV network VH1 placed &quot;Hotel California&quot; at number 38 on their 100 Greatest Albums of All Time list. &quot;Hotel California&quot; was ranked 13th in a 2005 survey held by British television&#x27;s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 37 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, dropping to number 118 in the 2020 reboot of the list. The album also was placed at the 99th spot on Apple Music&#x27;s 100 Best Albums list in 2024.

The song &quot;Hotel California&quot; was ranked number 49 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2004. It maintained the ranking in 2010, and was re-ranked at number 311 in 2021.

===Awards and nominations===
The album and its tracks were nominated for five Grammy awards in 1978, winning two; Record of the Year for the title track and Best Arrangement for Voices for &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s manager Irving Azoff refused requests by the ceremony&#x27;s producer for the band to attend or perform at the ceremony unless a win was guaranteed. The band therefore did not appear at the ceremony to collect their awards. Henley later said: &quot;The whole idea of a contest to see who is &#x27;best&#x27; just doesn&#x27;t appeal to us.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album first entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number four, reaching number one in its fourth week in January 1977. It topped the chart for eight weeks (non-consecutively), and it was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in a week of release. In its first year of release it sold nearly 6 million copies in the United States, and by July 1978 it has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide (7 million in the US and 2.5 million elsewhere internationally). On March 20, 2001, the album was certified 16× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, denoting shipment of 16 million in the United States, and had sold over 17 million copies in the US by 2013. Worldwide the album has sold 32 million copies. On August 20, 2018, the album was certified 26× platinum by the RIAA for 26 million units consumed in the United States under the new system that tallies album and digital track sales as well as streams.

The album produced two number one hit singles on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, on February 26, 1977, and &quot;Hotel California&quot; on May 7, 1977.

==Allegedly stolen lyric sheets==

In July 2022, three men, all involved in rare book and memorabilia dealing, were indicted by a Manhattan, New York City, grand jury on felony charges of conspiracy and possession of stolen property; one was further charged with hindering prosecution. Prosecutors alleged that they had forged provenance documents attempting to demonstrate that they were the lawful owners of some of Frey and Henley&#x27;s original drafts of lyrics for songs on the album, including &quot;Hotel California&quot; and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; and &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, when they in fact knew those materials, around a hundred handwritten pages on yellow notebook paper estimated to be worth $1 million in total, to have been stolen. Their plot had come to light after, having sold Henley some of the documents for $8,500 in 2012, they returned to Henley offering to sell him some more after listing them at Sotheby&#x27;s four years later; he then filed a complaint with the New York County district attorney&#x27;s office. All three protested their innocence through their attorneys.

The three were alleged to have acquired the documents from Ed Sanders, a journalist who had been hired to write a biography of the band around the time of &quot;Hotel California&quot;. Sanders did not finish the work until after the band had broken up and the project was eventually canceled. He is not charged or named in the indictment, but in a news release announcing it, the D.A.&#x27;s office described the papers as &quot;originally stolen in the late 1970s by an author who had been hired to write a biography of the band.&quot; The indictment also quotes an &quot;Individual 1&quot; as telling one of the indicted men in an email that he &quot;was staying at Henley&#x27;s place in Malibu and had total access to his boxes of stuff, and there was a lot, and I compiled a box of files I wanted and his assistant mailed them to me.&quot; &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; found also that an archived version of the 2016 Sotheby&#x27;s listing online identified Sanders as the then-owner.

<text>Liberalization or liberalisation (British English) is a broad term that refers to the practice of making laws, systems, or opinions less severe, usually in the sense of eliminating certain government regulations or restrictions. The term is used most often in relation to economics, where it refers to economic liberalization, the removal or reduction of restrictions placed upon (a particular sphere of) economic activity. However, liberalization can also be used as a synonym for decriminalization or legalization (the act of making something legal after it used to be illegal), for example when describing drug liberalization.

==In economy and trade==

Economic liberalization refers to the reduction or elimination of government regulations or restrictions on private business and trade. It is usually promoted by advocates of free markets and free trade, whose ideology is also called economic liberalism. Economic liberalization also often involves reductions of taxes, social security, and unemployment benefits.

Economic liberalization is often associated with privatization, which is the process of transferring ownership or outsourcing of a business, enterprise, agency, public service or public property from the public sector to the private sector. For example, the European Union has liberalized gas and electricity markets, instituting a competitive system. Some leading European energy companies such as France&#x27;s EDF and Sweden&#x27;s Vattenfall remain partially or completely in government ownership. Liberalized and privatized public services may be dominated by big companies, particularly in sectors with high capital, water, gas, or electricity costs. In some cases they may remain legal monopolies, at least for some segments of the market like consumers. Liberalization, privatization and stabilization are the Washington Consensus&#x27;s trinity strategy for economies in transition.

The Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, which recommended the establishment of International Monetary Fund (IMF) &quot;and the World Bank&quot;, had also recommended the establishment of an International Trade Organization (ITO). Although, the IMF and the World Bank were established in 1946, the proposal for ITO did not materialize. Instead, the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade &quot;(GATT)&quot;, a less ambitious institution, was formed in 1948. The primary objective of GATT is to expand international trade by liberalizing trade so as to bring about all round economic prosperity. GATT was signed in 1947, came into effect in 1948 and lasted until 1994. It was replaced by the World Trade Organization in 1995. The original GATT text (GATT 1947) is still in effect under the WTO framework. Thus liberalization was born.

There is also a concept of hybrid liberalization. For instance, in Ghana, cocoa crops can be sold to competing private companies, but there is a minimum price for which it can be sold and all exports are controlled by the state.
The term liberalization has its origin in the political ideology liberalism, which took form by the early 19th century.

==In social policy and government==
In social policy, liberalization may refer to a relaxation of laws restricting certain practices or activities, such as divorce, abortion, or psychoactive drugs. Regarding civil rights, it may refer to the elimination of laws prohibiting homosexuality, private ownership of firearms or other items, same-sex marriage, inter-racial marriage, or inter-faith marriage.

There is a distinct difference between liberalization and democratization. Liberalization can take place without democratization, and deals with a combination of policy and social change specialized to a certain issue, such as the liberalization of government-held property for private purchase. Democratization is politically highly specialized; it can arise from a liberalization but works on a broader level of governmental liberalization.

<doc id="189008" wikidata="Q10937578" url="?curid=189008" title="Puja (Hinduism)">
<text> () is a worship ritual performed by Hindus to offer devotional homage and prayer to one or more deities, to host and honour a guest, or to spiritually celebrate an event. It may honour or celebrate the presence of special guests, or their memories after they die. The word &quot;puja&quot; is roughly translated into English as &#x27;reverence, honour, homage, adoration, or worship&#x27;. &quot;Puja&quot; (পুজো / পুজা in bangla), the loving offering of light, flowers, and water or food to the divine, is the essential ritual of Hinduism. For the worshipper, the divine is visible in the image, and the divinity sees the worshipper. The interaction between human and deity, between human and guru, is called a &quot;Darshanam&quot;.

In Hindu practice, &quot;puja&quot; is done on a variety of occasions, frequencies, and settings. It may include a daily &quot;puja&quot; done in the home, or occasional temple ceremonies and annual festivals. In other cases, &quot;puja&quot; is held to mark a few lifetime events such as the birth of a baby, house entering ceremony or &quot;grihapravesh&quot;, first rice-eating ceremony or &quot;annaprasana&quot;, wedding, sacred thread ceremony or upanayana ceremony for the Brahmins or to begin a new venture. The two main areas where &quot;puja&quot; is performed are in the home and at temples to mark certain stages of life, events or some festivals such as Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Janmashtami, and Lakshmi Puja. &quot;Puja&quot; is not mandatory in Hinduism. It may be a routine daily affair for some Hindus, a periodic ritual for some, and rare for other Hindus. In some temples, various &quot;pujas&quot; may be performed daily at various times of the day; in other temples, they may be occasional.

All significant Indian holidays, including Rakhi, Diwali, Holi, Karva Chauth, Ganesh Chaturthi, Janmashtami, and Navaratri, have rituals known as &quot;puja&quot;.

For example, a chirathu (also known as a diya), clarified butter wicks, bells, flowers, incense sticks, cones, roli or kumkum (a red powder with turmeric mixed in applied to the forehead), rice, tilakam, chandanam (sandal sticks), idols, and samagri havanam are some common items utilized in puja. In Hinduism, &quot;puja&quot; is a sattvik work.

&quot;Puja&quot; varies according to the sect, region, occasion, deity honored, and steps followed. In formal &quot;Nigama&quot; ceremonies, a fire may be lit in honor of the god Agni, without an idol or image present. In contrast, in Agama ceremonies, an idol or icon or image of a deity is present. In both ceremonies, a lamp (Diya) or incense stick may be lit while a prayer is chanted or a hymn is sung. &quot;Puja&quot; is typically performed by a Hindu worshiper alone, though sometimes in the presence of a priest who is well-versed in complex rituals and hymns. In temples and priest-assisted events &quot;puja&quot;, food, fruits, and sweets may be included as sacrificial offerings to the ceremony or deity, which, after the prayers, becomes &quot;prasadam&quot; – food shared by all gathered.

Both Nigama and Agama &quot;puja&quot; are practised in Hinduism in India. In the Hinduism of Bali, Indonesia, Agama puja is most prevalent inside homes and in temples. &quot;Puja&quot; is sometimes called &quot;Sembahyang&quot; in Indonesia.

==Etymology==
 () in Sanskrit means to &quot;honour, respect; homage, worship, adoration; hospitable reception or showing honour or homage in a house of worship, the temple. J. A. B. van Buitenen states that &quot;puja&quot; emerged from yajna rituals, linking it to the &quot;Pravargya&quot; Vedic rite. The &quot;Rigveda&quot; in hymn 8.17 uses the word &quot;Sachipujanayam&quot; (शाचिपूजनायं) in the twelfth verse, where it is an epithet for god Indra in a context of vocative singular &quot;praise&quot;. The ancient scholar and Vedic text commentator Sāyana explains the term as a form of &quot;praise, worship, invocation&quot;. The &quot;Grhyasutras&quot; use &quot;puj&quot; in the context of rites, as does Sanskrit scholar Pāṇini. However, none of these texts imply &quot;puja&quot; as a form of devotional prayer worship.

According to Natalia Lidova, &quot;puja&quot; is unlikely to be of Indo-Aryan and Vedic origin because it lacks a Sanskrit root and it also lacks cognate parallels in other Indo-European languages. Its root are probably Dravidian in origin, but the evidence for this alternative hypothesis is also largely missing possibly because devotional worship is not as ancient as Hinduism. Collins states that the roots may be &quot;pu&quot; (flower) and &quot;ge&quot; (make), or a form of &quot;making flower sacrifice&quot;. However, this proposal is problematic because &quot;pu&quot; comes from an Indo-European root, while &quot;ge&quot; from Dravidian. Charpentier suggests the origin of the word &quot;puja&quot; may lie in the Dravidian languages. Two possible Malayalam roots may be &#x27;to smear with something&#x27; or &quot;to do with flowers&quot; (from &#x27;flower&#x27; and &#x27;to do&#x27;). Tamil roots have also been suggested: &#x27;to smear with something&#x27; or &quot;to do with flowers&quot; (from &#x27;flower&#x27; and &#x27;to do&#x27;) or similar Telugu roots (from &#x27;flower&#x27; and &#x27;to do&#x27;).

According to the Shiva Purana, &quot;puja&quot; is derived from cognate of two Sanskrit words &quot;puh&quot; and &quot;jayate&quot;, &quot;puh&quot; meaning &#x27;achievement of fruits of enjoyment&#x27; while &quot;jayate&quot; refers to &#x27;something to be born&#x27;. Hence &quot;puja&quot; refers to the rite by which one attains fruits of enjoyment of things like good ideas and knowledge.

==Origins==
According to scholars, one of the earliest mentions of &quot;pūjā&quot; is in the Grihya Sutras, which provide rules for domestic rites. These sutras, dated to be about 500 BC, use the term puja to describe the hospitality to honour priests who were invited to one&#x27;s home to lead rituals for departed ancestors. As with vedic times, the general concept of puja remained the same, but expanded to welcoming the deity along with the deity&#x27;s spiritual essence as one&#x27;s honored guest. The Puranic corpus of literature, dating from about 6th century CE, contain extensive outline on how to perform deity puja (&quot;deva pūjā&quot;). Deity puja thus melds Vedic rites with devotion to deity in its ritual form. As with many others aspects of Hinduism, both Vedic puja and devotional deity puja continued, the choice left to the Hindu.

As a historical practice, &quot;pūjā&quot; in Hinduism, has been modelled on the idea of hosting a deity, or important person, as an honoured and dearest guest in the best way one can, given one&#x27;s resources, and receiving their happiness and blessing in return. Paul Thieme suggests from passages in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; that the word &quot;pūjā&quot; referred to the hospitable reception of guests and that the things offered to guests could be offered to the gods and their dwellings. The rituals in question were the &quot;five great sacrifices&quot; or &quot;pañcamahāyajña&quot; recorded in the &quot;Gṛhyasūtra&quot; texts (for this literature, see Kalpa). The development of &quot;pūjā&quot; thus emerged from Vedic domestic traditions and was carried into the temple environment by analogy: just as important guests had long been welcomed in well-to-do homes and offered things that pleased them, so too were the gods welcomed in temple-homes and offered things that pleased them. Copper-plate charters recording grants of lands to temples show that this religious practice was actively encouraged from the mid-4th century.

== Significance ==

In the earliest texts describing Vedic puja, the significance of puja was to host the priest so that he could make direct requests to the gods. An example petition prayer made during a Vedic puja, according to Wade Wheelock, is:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Indra-Agni, slayers of Vrtra with the beautiful thunderbolt, prosper us with new gifts;&quot;
&quot;O Indra, bring treasures with your right hand;&quot;
&quot;O Agni grant the enjoyments of a good household;&quot;
&quot;Give [us] vigour, wealth in cattle, and possession of good horses.&quot;
– ÄsvSü
&lt;/poem&gt;
The purpose of the requests are to burn the past karmas to be able to experience oneness with the Brahman through the help of the deity. It is a form of bhakti Yoga whose final result aims to be the consciousness of god through homage to god. Nevertheless, even with this evolved theoretical spiritual significance, many people use puja as vehicle to petition desires and appeals, such as for good health of one&#x27;s child, speedy recovery from illness, success in venture envisioned or such. In the structure and practice of puja, the mantras and rituals focus on spirituality, and any petitions and appeals are tacked only to the end of the puja.

Zimmer relates puja to yantras, with the rituals helping the devotee focus on the spiritual concepts. Puja in Hinduism, writes Zimmer, is a path and process of transformation of consciousness, where the devotee and the spiritual significance of the deity are brought together. This ritual puja process, in different parts of India, is considered to be liberating, releasing, purifying and a form of Yoga of spirit and emotions.

Puja in Hinduism sometimes involves themes beyond idols or images. Even persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything is seen as manifestations of divine reality by some Hindus. The access to the divine is not limited to renunciatory meditation as in yoga school of Hinduism or idols in bhakti school. For some the divine is everywhere, without limit to its form, and a puja to these manifestations signifies the same spiritual meaning to those who choose to offer a prayer to persons, places, rivers, concrete objects or anything else.

==Types of Puja==

=== Durga Puja ===
Durga Puja, also known as Durgotsava or Sharodotsav, is an annual festival celebrated in the Indian subcontinent, particularly in Bengal, Assam, and other eastern Indian states as well as in Bangladesh. It honors the Hindu goddess Durga and celebrates her victory over the demon Mahishasura. The festival spans ten days, with the last five being the most significant. During this time, elaborate rituals are performed both in homes and public spaces, including the construction of temporary structures called pandals. Durga Puja features scripture recitations, performances, feasting, gift-giving, and public processions known as melā. It holds great significance in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism and coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other Hindu traditions. The festival celebrates not only the triumph of good over evil but also serves as a harvest festival, honoring Durga as the motherly power behind life and creation. Durga Puja involves the worship of various deities, including Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya, alongside Durga. It culminates with the immersion of clay sculptures of the goddess into rivers or water bodies, symbolizing her return to the divine cosmos.

=== Guru puja ===
In the case of great spiritual masters, there is also a custom to perform puja for a living person especially at Guru Purnima. Gurus are sometimes chosen as objects of puja and honoured as living gods or seen as the embodiment of specific deities. Gurus are sometimes adorned with symbolic clothes, garlands and other ornaments, and celebrated with incense, washing and anointing their feet, giving them fruits, food and drink and meditating at their feet, asking for their blessing.

=== Govardhan Puja ===
Govardhan Puja, also known as Annakut or Annakoot, is a Hindu festival celebrated on the first lunar day of the bright fortnight of the month of Kartika, typically falling on the fourth day of Diwali. During this festival, devotees honor Govardhan Hill and express gratitude to Lord Krishna by preparing and offering a diverse array of vegetarian foods.

For followers of Vaishnavism, Govardhan Puja commemorates the event described in the Bhagavata Purana where Lord Krishna lifted Govardhan Hill to shield the villagers of Vrindavan from heavy rainfall. This act symbolizes divine protection for devotees who wholly rely on God for refuge. To mark this occasion, devotees present a symbolic &quot;mountain of food&quot; representing Govardhan Hill as an offering to God, reaffirming their faith and devotion.

Govardhan Puja is widely observed by various Hindu denominations across India and beyond.

=== Temple pūjā ===

Temple (&quot;Mandir&quot;) pūjā is more elaborate than the domestic versions and typically done several times a day. They are also performed by a temple priest, or &quot;pujari&quot;. In addition, the temple deity (patron god or goddess) is considered a resident rather than a guest, so the &quot;puja&quot; is modified to reflect that; for example the deity is &quot;awakened&quot; rather than &quot;invoked&quot; in the morning. Temple &quot;pujas&quot; vary widely from region to region and for different sects, with devotional hymns sung at Vaishnava temples for example. At a temple &quot;puja&quot;, there is often less active participation, with the priest acting on behalf of others.

== Puja Elements ==


A full home or temple &quot;puja&quot; can include several traditional &quot;upacaras&quot; or &quot;attendances&quot;. The following is an example &quot;puja&quot;; these steps may vary according to region, tradition, setting, or time particularly in ways the deity is hosted. In this example, the deity is invited as a guest, the devotee hosts and takes care of the deity as an honored guest, hymns and food are offered to the deity, after an expression of love and respect the host takes leave and with affection expresses good bye to the deity. Indologist Jan Gonda has identified 16 steps (shodasha upachara) that are common in all varieties of puja:

# &quot;Avahana&quot; (&quot;invocation&quot;). The deity is invited to the ceremony from the heart.
# &quot;Asana&quot;. The deity is offered a seat.
# &quot;Padya&quot;. The deity&#x27;s feet are symbolically washed.
# Water is offered for washing the head and body
# &quot;Arghya&quot;. Water is offered so the deity may wash its mouth.
# &quot;Snana&quot; or &quot;abhisheka&quot;. Water is offered for symbolic bathing.
# &quot;Vastra&quot; (&quot;clothing&quot;). Here a cloth may be wrapped around the image and ornaments affixed to it. If a male deity, then a dhoti is draped. If female, a sari is draped.
# &quot;Yajnopavita&quot; or &quot;Mangalsutra&quot;. Putting on the sacred thread (Yajnopavita thread if male and Mangalasutra thread if female).
# &quot;Anulepana&quot; or &quot;gandha&quot;. Perfumes and ointments are applied to the image. Sandalwood paste (chandana paste) or kumkum is applied. If a female deity, turmeric powder, sindoor, kumkum and eye cosmetic (&quot;kajjalam&quot; aka kaajal) is offered.
# &quot;Pushpam&quot;. Flowers are offered before the image, or garlands draped around its neck.
# &quot;Dhupa&quot;. Incense is burned before the image.
# &quot;Aarathi&quot;. A burning lamp is waved in front of the image. Usually, the aarti flame is burned using camphor or ghee-soaked wicks as &quot;Maha-neeraajanam&quot;.
# &quot;Naivedya&quot;. Foods such as cooked rice, fruit, clarified butter, sugar, and betel leaf are offered.
# &quot;Taamboola&quot;. Betel nut, betel leaves, rice grains, turmeric pieces and money are offered.
# &quot;Namaskara&quot; or &quot;pranama&quot;. The worshipper and family bow or prostrate themselves before the image to offer homage.
# &quot;Parikrama&quot; or &quot;Pradakshina&quot;. Circumambulation around the deity.
# Taking leave.

Sometimes additional steps are included:
# &quot;Dhyanam&quot; (&quot;Meditation&quot;). The deity is invoked in the heart of the devotee.
# &quot;Achamaneeyam&quot;. Water is offered for sipping.
# &quot;Aabharanam&quot;. The deity is decorated with necklaces and jewels.
# &quot;Chatram&quot;. Offering of ceremonial umbrella.
# &quot;Chamaram&quot; Offering of fan or fly-whisk (Chamara) to provide air-conditioning to the deity.
# &quot;Visarjana&quot; or &quot;Udvasana.&quot; The deity is moved from the place.

There are variations in this puja method such as:
# Pancha upachara puja (puja with five steps).
# Chatushasti upachara puja (puja with 64 steps).

The structure of elaborate puja also varies significantly between temples, regions, and occasions.

Archana puja is a brief intercessionary puja on behalf of an individual that can be undertaken after the main puja.

===Quick pūjā===

A quick puja has the same structure as acts people would ordinarily perform for a quick reception, hospitality and affectionate interaction with a beloved guest. First the deity is greeted, acknowledged by name and welcomed, sometimes with a &quot;diya&quot; or lighted incense stick. The devotee proceeds to connect with the spiritual manifestation by meditating (a form of &quot;darshan&quot;), or chanting hymns and mantras, then personal prayers follow. After the prayer is finished, the spiritual visitor as the guest is affectionately thanked and greeted goodbye. A quick meditative puja is sometimes offered by some Hindus without an idol or image. According to Chris Fuller, an anthropologist, Hindu texts allow flexibility and abbreviated puja according to the occasion, needs, and personal preferences.

== In Balinese Hinduism ==

In Hinduism of Bali Indonesia, puja is sometimes called &quot;Sembahyang&quot;. The word originates from two words in old Javanese: sembah and hyang. Sembah means to respect and bow down; Hyang means divine, God or Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa, holy man, and ancestors. So to pray means to respect, bow down, surrender to the divine and ancestors.

Sembahyang (puja) is an obligation for Balinese Hindus, the prayers and hymns are derived from the Vedas. A family typically offers prayers every day, with &quot;Kewangen&quot; and other offerings. Kewangen means aromatic, and it is made from leaves and flowers in form of auspicious Vedic symbols. Balinese use kewangen to worship the divine, both in form of Purusha (soul) and Pradana (body). As with India, Balinese make offerings, including symbolic inclusion of fire, incense and mantras.

== As a social and human rights event ==
Pūjā in Hinduism has served as a means for Hindu communities outside India to gather, socialize, discover new friends and sometimes discuss ways to address social discrimination of Hindus. For example, Marion O&#x27;Callaghan reports that the Hindu diaspora brought as indentured laborers to Trinidad by the British colonial government, suffered discriminatory laws that did not recognize traditional Hindu marriages or inheritance rights of children from a traditional Hindu marriage, nor did the non-Hindu majority government allow pyre cremation or construction of crematorium. These Hindu rituals were considered pagan and uncivilized. Pujas offered a way for Hindus to meet, socially organize and petition their human rights. Over time, pujas became as much a social and community recreational event as a religious event.

==Critique of &quot;pūjā&quot; in the Pūrva Mīmāṃsaka school==

Although &quot;pujā&quot; is accepted as a valid religious activity by Hindus at large, it has long been criticised by Mīmāṃsā thinkers. The foundational work of this school was the &quot;Karmamīmāṃsāsūtra&quot; or &quot;Aphorisms for Enquiry into the Act,&quot; composed by Jaimini. The earliest surviving commentary was by Śabara who lived around the end of the fourth century. Śabara&#x27;s commentary, known as &quot;Śabarabhāṣya&quot; held pride of place in Mīmāṃsā in that Sabara&#x27;s understanding was taken as definitive by all later writers.

In his chapter entitled &quot;Devatādikaraṇa&quot; (9: 1: 5: 6–9), Śabara examined the popular understanding of the gods and attempted to refute the belief that they have material bodies, are able to eat the offerings made to them, and are capable of being pleased and so able to reward worshippers. Basing himself on the Vedas (he refused to accept the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, &quot;Purāṇa&quot; texts or even the &quot;Smṛti&quot; literatures as valid sources of authority), Śabara concluded that the gods are neither corporeal nor sentient and thus unable to enjoy offerings or own property. For this he appealed to empirical observation, noting that offerings do not decrease in size when given to the gods; any decrease is simply due to exposure to the air. Likewise he argued that substances are offered to gods not according to the wishes of the gods, but that &quot;what is vouched for by direct perception is that the things are used according to the wishes of the temple servants (&quot;pratyakṣāt pramāṇāt devatāparicārakāṇām abhiprāyaḥ&quot;).

In the course of his discussion, Śabara&#x27;s asserted that &quot;there is no relation between the case of guests and the sacrificial act.&quot; This incidental remark provided sound historical proof that &quot;pūjā&quot; was built on analogy with &quot;atithi&quot;, the ancient Vedic tradition of welcoming guests. What Śabara was maintaining was that this analogy was not valid.

While the Mīmāṃsakas continued to maintain this interpretation for centuries, their defeat in debate at the hands of Śaṅkarācārya led to theirs being a minority view. Mīmāṃsakas flourished even into the 17th century, as evidenced by the commentaries of Nīlakaṇṭha.

<doc id="189015" wikidata="Q1061077" url="?curid=189015" title="Code generation (compiler)">
<text>In computing, code generation is part of the process chain of a compiler, in which an intermediate representation of source code is converted into a form (e.g., machine code) that can be readily executed by the target system.

Sophisticated compilers typically perform multiple passes over various intermediate forms. This multi-stage process is used because many algorithms for code optimization are easier to apply one at a time, or because the input to one optimization relies on the completed processing performed by another optimization. This organization also facilitates the creation of a single compiler that can target multiple architectures, as only the last of the code generation stages (the &quot;backend&quot;) needs to change from target to target. (For more information on compiler design, see Compiler.)

The input to the code generator typically consists of a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree. The tree is converted into a linear sequence of instructions, usually in an intermediate language such as three-address code. Further stages of compilation may or may not be referred to as &quot;code generation&quot;, depending on whether they involve a significant change in the representation of the program. (For example, a peephole optimization pass would not likely be called &quot;code generation&quot;, although a code generator might incorporate a peephole optimization pass.)

==Major tasks==
In addition to the basic conversion from an intermediate representation into a linear sequence of machine instructions, a typical code generator tries to optimize the generated code in some way.

Tasks which are typically part of a sophisticated compiler&#x27;s &quot;code generation&quot; phase include:
* Instruction selection: which instructions to use.
* Instruction scheduling: in which order to put those instructions. Scheduling is a speed optimization that can have a critical effect on pipelined machines.
* Register allocation: the allocation of variables to processor registers
* Debug data generation if required so the code can be debugged.

Instruction selection is typically carried out by doing a recursive postorder traversal on the abstract syntax tree, matching particular tree configurations against templates; for example, the tree codice_1 might be transformed into a linear sequence of instructions by recursively generating the sequences for codice_2 and codice_3, and then emitting the instruction codice_4.

In a compiler that uses an intermediate language, there may be two instruction selection stages—one to convert the parse tree into intermediate code, and a second phase much later to convert the intermediate code into instructions from the instruction set of the target machine. This second phase does not require a tree traversal; it can be done linearly, and typically involves a simple replacement of intermediate-language operations with their corresponding opcodes. However, if the compiler is actually a language translator (for example, one that converts Java to C++), then the second code-generation phase may involve &quot;building&quot; a tree from the linear intermediate code.

==Runtime code generation==
When code generation occurs at runtime, as in just-in-time compilation (JIT), it is important that the entire process be efficient with respect to space and time. For example, when regular expressions are interpreted and used to generate code at runtime, a non-deterministic finite-state machine is often generated instead of a deterministic one, because usually the former can be created more quickly and occupies less memory space than the latter. Despite its generally generating less efficient code, JIT code generation can take advantage of profiling information that is available only at runtime.

==Related concepts==
The fundamental task of taking input in one language and producing output in a non-trivially different language can be understood in terms of the core transformational operations of formal language theory. Consequently, some techniques that were originally developed for use in compilers have come to be employed in other ways as well. For example, YACC (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) takes input in Backus–Naur form and converts it to a parser in C. Though it was originally created for automatic generation of a parser for a compiler, yacc is also often used to automate writing code that needs to be modified each time specifications are changed.

Many integrated development environments (IDEs) support some form of automatic source-code generation, often using algorithms in common with compiler code generators, although commonly less complicated. (See also: Program transformation, Data transformation.)

===Reflection===
In general, a syntax and semantic analyzer tries to retrieve the structure of the program from the source code, while a code generator uses this structural information (e.g., data types) to produce code. In other words, the former &quot;adds&quot; information while the latter &quot;loses&quot; some of the information. One consequence of this information loss is that reflection becomes difficult or even impossible. To counter this problem, code generators often embed syntactic and semantic information in addition to the code necessary for execution.

<doc id="189016" wikidata="Q457689" url="?curid=189016" title="Surfboard">
<text>A surfboard is a narrow plank used in surfing. Surfboards are relatively light, but are strong enough to support an individual standing on them while riding an ocean wave. They were invented in ancient Hawaii, where they were known as &quot;papa hee nalu&quot; in the Hawaiian language, and were usually made of wood from local trees, such as koa. They were often over in length and extremely heavy. Major advances over the years include the addition of one or more fins (skegs) on the bottom rear of the board to improve directional stability, and numerous improvements in materials and shape.

Modern surfboards are made of polyurethane or polystyrene foam. Unlike soft top surfboards, hard top surfboards are also covered with layers of fiberglass cloth, polyester or epoxy resin. The result is a light and strong surfboard that is buoyant and maneuverable. Recent developments in surfboard technology have included the use of carbon fiber and kevlar composites, as well as experimentation in biodegradable and ecologically friendly resins made from organic sources. Each year, approximately 400,000 surfboards are manufactured.

== Sizing ==
Choice of surf board type and size can be complex. Depending, amongst other things, on:
* Skill, fitness and surfing style
* Expected wave conditions
* Body dimensions of the surfer (height and weight)

Traditionally board lengths have been sized according to the height of the surfer, meaning in general that longer boards would be recommended for taller surfers. Standard dimensions for board size has for long been the board&#x27;s length, width and thickness. More recently however, the weight of the surfer has also started to be taken into account, meaning in general that a heavier surfer would be recommended a board with more volume.

==Parts==
===Bottom===

The surface of the board that rests on the water is usually flat or concave but sometimes convex. The bottom can also feature channels, chines, steps and other planing features shaped into the board in order to maximize, direct or alter water flow across the board&#x27;s bottom surface.

====Concave====
Modern surfboards often contain multiple contours on the bottom of the board, termed &quot;concaves&quot;. These concaves have different uses and vary among different types of surfboards. Most concaves on the modern shortboard begin about back from the nose of the board on the bottom and then carry out through the middle to the tail of the surfboard. The purpose of concave is to direct water through the fins of the surfboard. Surfboard shapers sometimes experiment with concaves to create different drive and response characteristics on each individual surfboard.

====Convex====
Some older and more traditional surfboards along with many modern boards that take inspiration from these older boards utilize a convex rather than concave design on the bottom of the surfboard. These boards displace more water and sit lower in the wave than a surfboard with a concave bottom.

===Deck===
The &quot;deck&quot; is the surface of the board that the surfer stands on. Contours such as concaves (similar to the deck of a skateboard) or rail channels (to add structural rigidity) can also be shaped into the deck. Surfwax is applied to this surface. Wax comes in different degrees of hardness allowing its application in differing water temperatures. The ideal choice of wax hardness is determined by the water temperature. 

===Fins===
The surfboard fin is a stabilizing rudder fixed to the rear of the surfboard to prevent it from sliding sideways. In the early days, surfers would stabilize the board by hanging the toes of their back foot over the edge of the board and would steer by putting their foot in the water. The American surfer Tom Blake was the first to experiment with adding a fin to a surfboard, fastening the keel from an old speedboat to a surfboard in 1935. About one or two years later, Woody &quot;Spider&quot; Brown independently developed a similar design, but Brown himself gave Blake precedence: &quot;(I made my first surfboard keel) about &#x27;36 or &#x27;37, somewhere in there; about the same time. But, I didn&#x27;t know anything about (Blake) and his experiments with adding fins to surfboards. See, we were all separated out. I was in San Diego and he was in L.A., way up there.&quot;. This innovation revolutionized surfing, allowing surfers to direct the board&#x27;s momentum and providing more balance when turning.

The template of the modern surfboard fin was developed by George Greenough in the 1960s. The single fin changed little until the late 70s, when a second was added and popularised by Australian Mark Richards. In October 1980, after seeing a twin fin surfboard with a &quot;trigger point&quot; fin Simon Anderson had the idea for a new, equal size, version of the existing three fin prototypes which was later dubbed the &quot;thruster&quot;. He created a prototype and 30 years later his &quot;thruster&quot; design is still the most popular fin design for surfboards.

In the early 90s removable fin systems were developed and embraced. This provides a standardized system that allows fins to be easily removed or replaced, utilizing set screws to hold the fins in place. These systems provided surfers with the ability to alter the riding characteristics of a surfboard, by changing the size and shape of fins used. This innovation opened the market to a range of fin designs, including single foiled fins, concave inside surfaces, and curved fins. Another variation of fin was later designed in the time frame known as the soul fin, a sleek bendable attachment.

Tunnel fins were invented in the 1960s by Richard Deese, and were found on longboards by multiple manufacturers of that era, including Dewey Weber. Bob Bolen, A.K.A. &#x27;the Greek&#x27;, patented the &quot;Turbo Tunnel&quot; in the late 1990s.

Since the mid 1990s, half tunnel fins have mainly been used on very long hollow wooden surfboards mainly surfed by Roy Stuart.

Bullet Fins were invented in the 2005 by Ron Pettibone to increase surfboard hull planing and rail-to-rail transition speed. The patent-pending fins are based on 50 years of hydrodynamic research on the bulbous bow hull design. Just as with the bow of a ship, the traditional surfboard fin creates a wave as it displaces the water in its path. The resulting turbulence places drag on the surfboard. The bulb of the Bullet Fin reduces this drag by creating a new (primary) fin wave in front of the original (secondary) wave. This new bulb wave is designed to be nearly 180 degrees out of phase with the original fin wave to subtract its turbulence thus reducing fin drag.

Winged fins are another type of surfboard fin, the genesis of which was America&#x27;s Cup sailboat design. The Starfin was designed in the 1980s by the America&#x27;s Cup yacht designer, Ben Lexcen, who had designed the winged keel for the America&#x27;s Cup boat, Australia II. The small thruster-sized fin, the RedTip 3D is manufactured by FCS.

Fins with winglets—tiny wings—were invented in 2005. The purpose of winglets, as in airplane design, is to increase lift (horizontal turning force in the case of surfboard fins) while reducing drag, by reducing the fin-tip vortex.

Fins with a camber have an asymmetrical profile. In windsurfing camber is used to increase the lift to drag ratio of the fin and to minimise cavitation and the risk of spin-out. In particular windsurfers trying to improve speed records use camber fins, as the maximum performance is required on one down-wind course direction. As the camber is fixed to one side, performance when sailing in one direction is improved but performance in the other way is deteriorated.

Fins with self-adjusting camber offer the improved qualities in both port side and starboard side sailing directions.

Spitfire fins are based on the wing configuration used by Spitfire aeroplanes. The elliptical wing shapes work very well as surfboard fins and several manufacturers make fins with this more upright stance, as it increases drive and maneuverability.

In 2004 Frank Fish introduced the world to Whale Bumps with their Tubercle effect. Several fin manufacturers tried making some fins at that time, after the article was discussed on Swaylock&#x27;s design Forum. The process of grinding bumps, which are properly foiled, into an existing fin is an arduous, time consuming task. Hand foiling tubercles can take up to 40 hours+. Roy Stuart worked on wooden prototypes for years before creating the first polycarbonate, 3d printed, whale bumped surfboard fins in 2013.

====Thrusters and Tri-fins====
The tri-fin&#x27;s design attempts to incorporate the glide of a longboard and the performance of a shortboard into a single layout. The additional fins ensure that even what riding down the line, two, or at least one, vertical control surface is in black water (not unstable foam) allows riders better turning capabilities. In a Thruster, the symmetrically-foiled center fin is flanked by twin asymmetric, cambered fins. The camber is angled front in and top in, directing energy from the incoming wave to lift the board and straighten it, not dissimilar from the force vectoring provided by the geometry of a rocket&#x27;s nozzle.
====Quad====
A &quot;Quad&quot; four fins, typically arranged as two pairs of thrusters in wing formation, which are quick down the line but tend to lose energy through turns. The energy is lost as the board goes up the wave because the fins are now vectoring energy from the oncoming water toward the back of the board, bleeding speed.

====Nubster====

Created by professional surfer Sean Mattison as a rear stabilization fin. Dubbed a &quot;guitar pick&quot; the nubster was designed to be used as a fifth fin. The Nubster helped professional surfer Kelly Slater win contests in New York and Portugal in 2011.

===Leash===
A surfboard leash or leg rope is the cord that attaches a surfboard to the surfer. It prevents the surfboard from being swept away by waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes comprise a urethane cord where one end has a band with a velcro strap attached to the surfer&#x27;s trailing foot, and the opposite has a velcro strap attached to the tail end of the surfboard.

Jack O&#x27;Neill lost his left eye in a surf leash accident as the surgical tubing used in the early designs allowed the leash to overstretch, causing the surfboard to fly back towards the surfer. Subsequent cords were made with less elastic materials.

===Nose===
The front tip of the board. This can be pointed or rounded and can be made with a steep incline (&quot;rocker&quot;, see below) or a gentle one.

===Tail===
The shape of the tail affects how a board responds. Tail shapes vary from square, pin, squash, swallow, diamond, and so on—each one in turn having its own family of smaller variants. A pin tail causes the board to move faster in the water, whereas the hip tail is created to help balance more than speed.

===Traction Pad===
Surfboard traction pads, deck grips, tailpads. There are several names for this piece of foam applied to the top of a surfboard to increase the grip and allow surfers to have more control and perform more high performance maneuvers. Traction pads are used on both shortboards and longboards, usually applied to the tail area of a surfboard.

Traction pads for the middle section of the deck, known as the &quot;Mid Traction Pads&quot; are mainly used on performance shortboards for increased grip. Unlike a tail pad - mid-deck traction pads need wax for added grip.

===Rails===
The edges of the board. A rounded rail is called &quot;soft&quot;, while a more squared-off rail is called &quot;hard&quot;, and rails that are in between are termed &quot;50/50&quot; (&quot;fifty-fifty&quot;). Larger, fuller rails contain a greater volume of foam giving the board increased buoyancy along the edge, while sharper, narrower rails have less volume, making the board easier to &quot;sink&quot; and &quot;lean on edge&quot;. While riding down the line, one rail is always in the water while the other is suspended freely in the air. Turns are largely a matter of transitioning from rail to tail and over to the contralateral (opposing) rail.

===Rocker===
This refers to the vertical curve of the board between nose and tail. Rockers may be described as either heavy (steeply curved) or relaxed (less curved) and may be either continuous (a single curve between tip of nose and end of tail) or staged (distinct flat section in middle portion of board). The &quot;nose rocker&quot; or &quot;flip&quot; is the curve between the front tip and the middle or flattest portion of the board, and the &quot;tail rocker&quot; or &quot;kick&quot; is that between the tail and the middle/ flattest portion. An increase in flip helps keep the board from &quot;pearling&quot;; larger boards often require a greater flip. A larger kick adds maneuverability and lift to the tail at speed and provides tail sensitivity in critical turns. More relaxed rockers help the board to handle better on flatter sections of water, while heavy rockers increase the board&#x27;s overall form drag but also give true lift when reaching planing speed and have a smaller turning radius.

The board&#x27;s rails and deck may also be referred to as having rocker. A board with a v-shaped tail, for example, has had the lower/ outer portion of its rear rails reduced, increasing its tail rail rocker. Having a flat, even deck rocker will increase a board&#x27;s flexibility, while a convex deck rocker creates a board that is thicker along the board&#x27;s stringer and stiffer in the water.

===Stringer===
In board design, the &quot;stringer&quot; is a board&#x27;s central plane of reflection, down the middle of its deck and its keel. In construction, the stringer can have no special parts, or can embed a stiff, thin, vertical slat, usually of wood but sometimes of carbon fiber, running from nose to tail. The stringer serves to increase the board&#x27;s overall strength and reduce its flexibility. Some boards have multiple stringers.

==Construction==
To achieve positive buoyancy and a stiff deck, shapers have always reached for a foam, often hardened with a tensile skin, using toucan beak engineering concepts.

Delamination is a problem where the skin of the board (i.e. fiberglass) separates from the foam core. All surfboards made of foam and resin can face the problem of delamination. A common reason for delamination is excessive heat. Delamination often first appears around dents.

Modern surfboards are usually made of foam using one of the following construction materials:
* Polyurethane (PU foam) with polyester resin have been used in surfboards since the 1950s, and is, therefore, the oldest of the modern construction methods. Many hand-shaped boards are made of PU since it is a brittle material, making it easy to form by hand using sandpaper, shortening the build time. Both PU boards made by hand or by machines are usually more affordable compared to other foam materials. Some drawbacks are the toxicity of the material, that it is non-recyclable and that the PU foam is more flexible than some alternatives, making the board less stiff so that it can bend and twist more during use. PU foam can also absorb water and yellow over time. It is also possible to build PU boards using epoxy resin. PU is still the most used material in surf board construction today.
* Polystyrene (PS foam) with epoxy resin has a lower weight, but is not as strong as the more traditional PU foam. The PS foam core is therefore enclosed with a layer of epoxy to increase strength. Within polystyrene, mainly two types are used in surfboard construction; EPS and XPS. The reason epoxy resin is used exclusively instead of polyester resin on these boards, is that the polystyrene foam reacts chemically upon contact with polyester resin, causing the PS foam to melt. EPS and XPS have the advantages that they are more environmentally friendly, can last longer and are recyclable. However, they are more time consuming to shape by hand, taking for example 2 to 4 times as long to build. Often PS boards are not as stiff as PU boards, which may be the reason most professional surfers still prefer PU.
** Expanded polystyrene is the lightest foam material commonly used to produce surfboards today, being lighter than both PU and XPS. A drawback to EPS is that it is difficult to shape by hand, and EPS boards are therefore typically made using machines where the shaping of the foam is near completed after the molding itself. It is possible to buy such semi-finished EPS boards (known as &quot;pop out boards&quot;) to which the buyer can add glassfiber and resin themselves. Another drawback with EPS foam is that it absorbs water more easily. EPS has a structure consisting of individually closed cells, but there are air gaps between the cells themselves where water can enter. This gives EPS a higher permeability. EPS boards typically don&#x27;t delaminate easily, but should be constructed using a vent to prevent delamination due to outgassing.
** Extruded polystyrene (XPS foam) is somewhat heavier than EPS, and usually weighs as much as PU or more. XPS has a homogenous structure consisting of several layers of continuously extruded closed cells. XPS therefore resists water absorption very well, since there are no air gaps between the beads. Depending on construction, XPS boards may however be more prone delamination due to the closed structure preventing the epoxy resin getting a good grip on the foam. Improvements in manufacturing has alleviated some of these problems. XPS boards typically don&#x27;t have a vent.

Fiberglass is the most common skin regardless of foam type. Other skin materials used are bamboo, carbon fiber, hemp kevlar and innegra.

EPS and XPS boards are sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;epoxy boards&quot;, while PU boards sometimes are erroneously referred to as &quot;fiberglass boards&quot;. These designations are not correct. Firstly, fiberglass is the most common skin for all the mentioned foam types. Secondly, PU foam boards can also be constructed using epoxy resin.

===Polyurethane (PU) boards===
Surfboards have traditionally been constructed using polyurethane foam and it remains a popular choice. They are made stronger with one or more stringers going down the middle of the board. The foam is molded into a &quot;blank&quot;, in the rough shape of a surfboard. Once the blanks have been made they are given to shapers. Shapers then cut, plane, and sand the board to its specifications. Finally, the board is covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth and resin. It is during this stage that the fins or boxes for removable fins are attached and the leash plug installed. Another method of making boards is using epoxy resin and prolapse polystyrene foam, instead of polyester resin and polyurethane foam. In recent years, surfboards made out of balsa and a polystyrene core are becoming more popular. Even solid balsa surfboards are available.

Although foam boards are usually shaped by hand, the use of machines to shape them has become increasingly popular. Vacuum forming and modern sandwich construction techniques borrowed from other industries have also become common. Many surfers have switched to riding sandwich-construction epoxy boards which have become especially popular with beginner surfers as they provide a durable, inexpensive, entry-level board.

===Balsa boards===

The Ochroma pyramidale wood&#x27;s surfboard history originates in the Hawaiians, and the wood lead surfing&#x27;s landfall on the US west coast in the 1940s. Being light and strong, balsa wood was long considered a perfect material for surfboards. Shapers could not use this fragile wood to make entire surfboards until after WWII, when fiberglass skins were invented.

Balsa wood boards are lighter, more buoyant and easier to handle than other boards. These boards have some disadvantages, however: they are not as sturdy as solid redwood boards.

===Hollow wooden boards===
Hollow wooden surfboards are made of wood and epoxy or oil (as a sustainable alternative to epoxy), and are a reversion to using wood after the foam became dominant in the 1950s. Hollow wooden surfboards specifically have no foam in their construction. (Boards made with foam and wood are commonly known as &quot;compsands&quot; or &quot;veneer boards&quot;.) Various construction methods are used to hollow the inside of the surfboard and lighten the weight of the completed board. Generally, a hollow wood surfboard is 30% to 300% heavier than a standard foam and resin surfboard. The main inspiration, apart from beauty, is that this is a more environmentally friendly method of construction (compared to epoxy and polyurethane methods) which uses fast-growing plantation wood such as paulownia, cedar, spruce, redwood, and, of course, balsa.

The current construction methods descend from the 1930s Tom Blake paddleboarding method, which favors a central stringer with individually shaped transverse ribs covered with a skin and rails. A modern interpretation of Tom Blake&#x27;s work is the perimeter stringer method used by some manufacturers, utilizing laminated rails as stringers connected with a series of plywood ribs. This skeleton is then sheathed with 5mm-thick wood strips, creating a fast hollow board with good flex properties.

The parallel profile system was developed from cold molded (double diagonal) boat building, and uses at least four layers of material laminated over a male mold into a curved blank, including enough wood for rails, which are then shaped.

The chambering method follows a system in which planks of paulownia wood are selected and the rocker of the board is cut into each. The planks are then chambered to reduce weight, and then bonded together to form a hollow or &quot;chambered&quot; blank.

===CUSH - skinned surfboards===
One of the most recent modern advancements in surfboard technology is the creation of high performance boards which are wrapped in a stretchable soft skin which does not absorb water. The internal structure of Cush (cushion) boards is an epoxy surfboard with an EPS (extruded polystyrene) shaped foam core. The &quot;skin&quot;, made of a gloss coated foam, is stretched and adhered while vacuumed over the surface of the entire epoxy surfboard. The purpose of the cush is for dampening of chatter, absorption of impact landings, airs, grip, and overall added protection for a light epoxy board. Jim Richardson, 25-year veteran shaper on the North Shore of Oahu, first pioneered this technology in the mid 1990s. And recently a few company&#x27;s including Spacestick, Radiowake and CUSH (brand) have begun to market the advancements to the surfing community. Spacestick and CUSH surfboards are the current manufacturer for the various brands as of 2018.

=== Composite Sandwich Construction ===
The Composite Sandwich type of board construction became popular among garage shapers and later, major manufacturers, during the 1990s and 2000s. This construction method entails hand- or machine-shaping a foam blank from EPS foam and then vacuum-bagging or hand-laminating a more dense layer of foam, wood, or carbon onto the bottom and deck of the EPS foam core, usually separating the two layers with lightweight fiberglass cloth (2 oz pr. sq.yd, or 70 g/m2) or other composites cloths. This can also be accompanied with parabolic rails made of balsa or other buoyant woods, carbon, or other high-density materials. This blank construction is then laminated with epoxy resin and fiberglass or other composite cloth as any other surfboard would be, by hand or via vacuum bag.

The construction is referred to as a sandwich as it consists of the top skin, fiberglass or other composite cloth, the EPS core, fiberglass or other composite cloth, and the bottom skin, the cross section of which appears as a sandwich with the different layers. Firewire Surfboards pioneered this technology for the mass-produced surfboard market beginning in 2006.

Soft skin construction, such as Cush or Spacestick boards, adds an additional soft shell skin to the outside of a sandwich construction board. The soft skin is vacuumed to the cloth and epoxy so that the soft shell is exposed--- meaning the hard glass and resin are protected inside, and under, the soft cush skin.

==Board types and variations==
===Shortboard===
Since the late 1960s when Gordon Clark found the optimum formulation of urethane foam, many of the surfboards in common use have been of the shortboard variety between in length with a pointed nose and a rounded or squarish tail, typically with three &quot;skegs&quot; (fins) but sometimes with two or as many as five. Surfers generally find a shortboard quick to maneuver compared with other types of surfboards, but because of a lack of flotation due to the smaller size, the shortboard is harder to catch waves with, often requiring steeper, larger and more powerful waves and very late takeoffs, where the surfer catches the wave at the critical moment before it breaks.

A &quot;Bonzer&quot; is a surfboard designed by the Campbell Brothers that can have three or five fins and is punctuated with a large center fin and 2-4 smaller side fins(side bites). This, combined with deep double concave channels creates a distinctive board. The manufacturer has shown that these channels create versatile and controlled characteristics using the venturi effect which guides the water off of the surface of the board through a narrowed passage.

====Hybrid====
Modern hybrid boards are usually in length with a more rounded profile and tail shape. Hybrid boards are usually used in smaller waves and can have any fin set up. They are more about having fun than high performance or tricks. They can be easier to ride for beginning surfers and generally perform well in surfing conditions where the more traditional long and short boards might not.
====Fish====
Usually a short stubby board under in length developed from kneeboards in 1967 by Steve Lis. Other prominent fish shapers include Skip Frye, Larry Mabile and Steve Brom. Primarily a twin fin set up with a swallow tail shape and popular in smaller waves, the fish enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the early 2000s after legendary surfer Tom Curren rode one during an ASP event at Hossegor. Note, any type of board (such as shortboard or mini-longboard) can have a fish tail, and these are commonly referred to as a &quot;fish&quot;, but they lack the other properties of a traditional, or &quot;retro&quot; fish as described here.

==== Mid length ====
A mid length surfboard is generally 177cm to 200cm (7&#x27; to 8&#x27;) in length with a slightly more performance-focused shape than the similar-sized normal board. Narrow outline &amp; thruster-fin set-up make it a close companion in size and performance to a round-outline single-fin mini mal. Mid length surfboards excel good in both small and weak &amp; large mushy waves by light and heavy surfers. A mid length is one of the most versatile &#x27;all-around&#x27; boards for fun and performance.

====Funboard====
The funboard combines elements of both shortboards and longboards and are generally midsized, usually have a length of , thickness of and width of . The funboard&#x27;s design allows waves to be caught more easily than a shortboard, yet with a shape that makes it more maneuverable than a longboard; hence it is a popular type of surfboard, especially among beginners or those transitioning from longboarding to the more difficult shortboarding. It is considered a good combination of the speed of a longboard and the maneuverability of a shortboard.

====Gun====
Big wave boards of length are considered &quot;guns&quot;. These have a thin, almost needle-like profile with single, quad, or thruster fin set up. It has the appearance of a shortboard but at a longboard size. Guns are often used at big wave locations such as Waimea Bay, Jaws (Hawaii), and Mavericks.

===Longboard===

The longboard is primarily a single-finned surfboard with large rounded nose and length of . Noseriders are a class of longboards that enable the rider to walk to the tip and nose ride. These are also called &quot;Mals&quot;, a shortened form of &quot;Malibu boards&quot;. They range from long, or taller than the rider in overall length. The advantage of a longboard is its substantial buoyancy and planing surface enable surfers to ride waves generally deemed too small to propel a shortboard. Longboards are more suitable for beginners because of the board&#x27;s size and ease of catching waves. In the proper conditions, a skilled surfer can ride a wave standing on the nose of a longboard with their toes over the nose&#x27;s edge: in this way, with the &quot;toes on the nose&quot;, the surfer can &quot;hang ten&quot;. Compared to the shortboards, longboards are considerably easier to learn on as they are capable of achieving stability, thus making the transition quite difficult.

====Classic longboards====
Longboards are the original and very first variety of board used in standup surfing. Ever since the sixth-century CE the ancient Hawaiians have used solid wooden boards when practicing their ancient art of Hoe he&#x27;e nalu. Surfing was brought to the Hawaiian Islands by Polynesians and has since become popular worldwide. The ancient boards were carved and fashioned out of solid wood, reaching lengths of long and weighing as much as 70 kg. Both men and women, royalty and commoners surfed. But the longest of boards (the Olo) was reserved for royalty. During the 19th century, some extreme western missionaries actively discouraged surfing, viewing it as sinful. Surfing almost died out completely. In recent times replicas have been made of Olo&#x27;s and alaia&#x27;s by experienced surfers and shapers wishing to explore the roots of the sport.

By the early 20th century, only a handful of people surfed, mostly at Waikiki. But there, it started to grow again. Beginning in 1912, Duke Kahanamoku, a Hawaiian Olympic swimmer in the early 1900s, brought surfing to mainland United States and Australia. Because of this, Duke is considered the &quot;Father of Modern Surfing&quot;. From that point on, surfing became an integral part of the California beach lifestyle. In Malibu (in Los Angeles county), the beach was so popular amongst the early surfers that it lent its name to the type of longboard, the Malibu Surfboard. In the 1920s boards made of plywood or planking called Hollowboards came into use. These were typically in length and very light. During the 1950s, the surf trend took off dramatically as it obtained a substantial amount of popularity as a sport. The design and material of longboards in the 1950s changed from using solid wood to balsa wood. The length of the boards still remained the same at an average of , and had then become widely produced. It was not until the late 1950s and early 1960s when the surfboard design had closely evolved into today&#x27;s modern longboard. The introduction of polyurethane foam and fiberglass became the technological leap in design. In the 1960s, the longboard continued to remain popular as its material changed from balsa wood to fiberglass and polyurethane foam. 

In the 1960s, the introduction of the shortboard, averaging , allowed surfers to make tighter turns, quicker maneuvers, and achieve faster speeds, thus radically changing the way people surfed. This &quot;shortboard revolution&quot; nearly made longboards obsolete for all practical purposes. But in the early 1990s, the longboard returned, integrating a number of the design features invented during the shortboard revolution. Surfers rediscovered the grace and poise – the &quot;glide&quot; – of the longboard, and the fun of classic maneuvers that are not possible on a shortboard. In some circles, the battle between longboards and shortboards continues. But many surfers live by a philosophy of finding the joy of surfing a mix of boards and surfing styles to suit the waves of the day.

====Modern longboards====
The modern longboard has undergone many changes since its earlier models in the past. Today&#x27;s longboard is much lighter than its predecessors. Its polyurethane foam and fiberglass design allows less drag on waves. Today&#x27;s longboards are typically long, although some ride boards up to in length. Additionally, there is a revival of stand-up paddle-based surfing with boards up to in length (for stability). The classic single-fin longboard retains much of its classic design including a single fin, weight, and considerable buoyancy. A longboard with a single fin allows the board to pivot turn in order to remain in the curl of the wave. Due to recent advances in technology, the longboard has expanded its family into different variations of the classic longboard.

====The 2+1====
The 2+1 longboard is the most versatile board of the longboard family, offering greater maneuverability. Sometimes referred as a &quot;single-fin with training wheels&quot;, the 2+1&#x27;s fins actually takes the features of the classic longboard and the Tri-fin. The fins of the 2+1 take the rigid stability of a classic longboard, and fuses with the strength and drive of a Tri-fin.

====Mini Tanker====
The mini tanker is basically a shortened longboard shape that utilizes the same longboard design elements and enhanced maneuverability due to the shorter shape. These boards are normally ridden by those wanting the feel of a longboard with the increased agility of a short board .

====The Malibu====
Named after Malibu, California, this racy longboard shape is a little narrower than most, with slightly pulled in nose and tail sections for extra maneuverability on Malibu&#x27;s famous right hand point breaks. This classic shape has been ridden and praised by experienced surfers for its maneuverability and performance. Classic tricks that can be performed on a Malibu are &quot;Hang Fives&quot; and &quot;Hang tens&quot; whereby the surfer walks to the nose of the board and hangs 5 or 10 toes over the nose, the &quot;soul arch&quot;, drop knee turns, head dips, switch stance maneuvers, and so on.

====Olo====
Originally reserved for Hawaiian royalty due to its size and weight, these wooden boards can exceed lengths of and reach weights up to 90 kg.

====Alaia====

A traditional finless wooden surfboard, typically ridden by ancient native Hawaiians, not of royal descent. The surfboard typically runs 90 kg.

However modern day Alaias can be much thinner. Many are a mere thick, and can be as short as . Common woods used in current construction are paulownia, cedar, and other woods suitable for salty ocean waters. The tails come in different styles. The boards are notoriously difficult to ride.

====Tandem====
The first stand up surfboard ridden in Australia by Duke Kahanamoku and Isabel Letham is an oversized longboard with enough buoyancy to support two people, tandem surfing.

<text>System software is software designed to provide a platform for other software. Examples of system software include operating systems (OS) (like macOS, Linux, Android, and Microsoft Windows).

Application software is software that allows users to do user-oriented tasks such as creating text documents, playing or developing games, creating presentations, listening to music, drawing pictures, or browsing the web. Examples of such software are computational science software, game engines, search engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications.

In the late 1940s, application software was custom-written by computer users to fit their specific hardware and requirements. System software was usually supplied by the manufacturer of the computer hardware and was intended to be used by most or all users of that system.

Many operating systems come pre-packaged with basic application software. Such software is not considered system software when it can be uninstalled without affecting the functioning of other software. Examples of such software are games and simple editing tools supplied with Microsoft Windows, or software development toolchains supplied with many Linux distributions.

Some of the grayer areas between system and application software are web browsers integrated deeply into the operating system such as Internet Explorer in some versions of Microsoft Windows, or ChromeOS where the browser functions as the only user interface and the only way to run programs (and other web browser their place).

==Operating systems or system control program==
The operating system (prominent examples being Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and z/OS), allows the parts of a computer to work together by performing tasks like transferring data between memory and disks or rendering output onto a display device. It provides a platform (hardware abstraction layer) to run high-level system software and application software.

A kernel is the core part of the operating system that defines an application programming interface for applications programs (including some system software) and an interface to device drivers.

Device drivers and firmware, including computer BIOS or UEFI, provide basic functionality to operate and control the hardware connected to or built into the computer.

A user interface interacts with a computer. It can either be a command-line interface (CLI) or, since the 1980s, a graphical user interface (GUI). This is the part of the operating system the user directly interacts with; it is considered an application and not system software.

== Utility software or system support programs ==

Some organizations use the term systems programmer to describe a job function that is more accurately termed systems administrator. Software tools these employees use are then called system software. This utility software helps to analyze, configure, optimize and maintain the computer, such as virus protection. The term system software can also include software development tools (like a compiler, linker, or debugger).

<text>Ramón Eduardo Arellano Félix (August 31, 1964 – February 10, 2002) was a Mexican drug lord who alongside his brothers founded and led the Tijuana Cartel (a.k.a. the Arellano-Félix Organization). He was the leader of the enforcement wing of the organization until his assassination on February 10, 2002.

==Biography==
Standing and , Ramon Arellano Félix was allegedly one of the most ruthless members of the cartel and was a suspect in various murders. Arellano Félix ordered the 1998 massacre of nineteen members of Castro Ramirez family outside of Ensenada, Baja California. The family was related to an alleged associate of the Arellano Félix Cartel. The Ramirez family oversaw the marijuana production and transport to Tecate and Tijuana, and was active before the Arellanos overtook the region. By murdering the whole family, the Arellano Felix Cartel eliminated the last bastion to the Cartel&#x27;s full control of the area. The massacre broke an unspoken pact amongst druglords: &quot;don&#x27;t touch the children.&quot;

While in hiding in Los Angeles in 1995, Arellano Félix was unwittingly the subject of a televised prank when he was approached outside Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Hollywood by Rupert Jee, who was filming a segment for the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

On 18 September 1997, Ramon Arellano Félix became the 451st fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted list. Leading to his Most Wanted Fugitive listing in the United States, he had been charged in a sealed indictment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, with Conspiracy to Import Cocaine and Marijuana in drug trafficking.

=== Kingpin Act sanction ===
On 1 June 2000, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Ramón under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the &quot;Kingpin Act&quot;), for his involvement in drug trafficking, along with eleven other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.

=== Death and aftermath ===
On 10 February 2002, Ramón 
Arellano Félix was killed in a gunfight in Bugambilia Street, Mazatlán, Sinaloa, where he was stopped due to a traffic infraction by Mexican police officer, Ángel Antonio Árias Torres. Arellano Félix drew his gun and mortally wounded Árias Torres twice in the chest, who fired back and killed Arellano Félix with a single bullet in the head while falling to the ground and dying. According to Jesús Zambada García (alias &quot;El Mayo&quot;), Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán ordered Árias Torres to enact the traffic stop and Arellano Félix&#x27;s execution. 

Arellano&#x27;s older brother, Benjamín Arellano Félix, the cartel&#x27;s mastermind, was arrested weeks later on 9 March. On 14 August 2006, the youngest of the Arellano brothers, Francisco Javier Arellano Félix, was arrested with some associates at sea, by the United States Coast Guard. They were in international waters off the coast of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. Francisco Javier was extradited to the U.S. on September 16, 2006.

The only brother of the Arellano Félix cartel then at large, Eduardo Arellano Félix, was captured by the Mexican Army on 26 October 2008. At the time, the US State Department had been offering a reward of up to US$5 million for information leading to his arrest. According to a Mexican official, at the time of Eduardo Arellano Félix&#x27;s capture, control of the cartel passed to Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano, a son of Eduardo Arellano Félix&#x27;s sister Alicia. 

At around 16:00 local time on 23 June 2014, Sánchez Arellano was arrested by soldiers of the Mexican Army and federal agents of the Procuraduría General de la República (PGR) at a 
Carl&#x27;s Jr. fast food restaurant in the Mesa de Otay borough in Tijuana, Baja California, while watching the FIFA World Cup game between Mexico and Croatia. Sánchez Arellano was wearing the Mexico national team jersey and had the team&#x27;s colors painted on his face. The arrest was made without a single shot fired. The security forces also confiscated US$100,000 he had with him at the moment of his arrest.

==In popular culture==
In the 2017 Netflix and Univision series, &quot;El Chapo&quot;, Rolf Petersen plays Ramón Avendaño (a fictionalized portrayal of Ramón Arellano Félix).

Arellano Félix is portrayed by Manuel Masalva in the 2018 crime drama, &quot;&quot;.

A 2003 Mexican film, &quot;El fin de los Arellano&quot; (&quot;The End of the Arellanos&quot;), featured characters supposedly based on the Arellano brothers; however, its plot bore practically no resemblance to the actual events.

The Arellano brothers were allegedly an inspiration for the two secondary characters of &quot;the Obregón brothers&quot;, featured in the 2000 US film &quot;Traffic&quot;.

<text>Calisthenics (American English) or callisthenics (British English) () is a form of strength training that utilizes an individual&#x27;s body weight as resistance to perform multi-joint, compound movements with little or no equipment.

== Origin and etymology ==
The Oxford English Dictionary describes callisthenics as &quot;gymnastic exercises to achieve fitness and grace of movement&quot;. The word &quot;calisthenics&quot; comes from the ancient Greek words (), which means &quot;beauty&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;strength&quot;. It is the art of using one&#x27;s body weight as resistance to develop muscles.

The practice was recorded as being used in ancient Greece, including by the armies of Alexander the Great and the Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae.

Calisthenics was also recorded to have been used in ancient China. Along with dietary practices, Han dynasty physicians prescribed calisthenics as one of the methods for maintaining one&#x27;s health.

== Common exercises ==

The more commonly performed calisthenic exercises include:

* Push-ups
: Performed face down on the floor, palms against the floor under the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position while avoiding resting on the floor. This exercise trains the chest, shoulders, and triceps. An easier version of this exercise consists of placing the hands on a wall and then bending and straightening the arms.
* Sit-ups
: A person lies on their back with their legs bent. They bend at the waist and move their head and torso towards their legs. They then lower themselves back down to the start position. For people who find it difficult to get down onto the ground, a similar range of motion can be achieved by standing with the legs slightly bent, and then bowing slightly and straightening up again.
*Curl-ups
:Curl-up is an abdominal exercise that enables both building and defining &quot;six-pack&quot; abs and tightening the belly.
* Squats
: Standing with the feet a shoulder-width apart, the subject squats down until their thighs are parallel with the floor; during this action, they move their arms forwards in front of them. They then return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to their sides. Squats train the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, gluteal muscles, and core. The height of the squat can be adjusted to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level of the individual (i.e. half or quarter squats rather than full squats). Since squats can be performed easily in most environments and with a limited amount of space, they are among the most versatile calisthenic exercises.
* Burpees
: A full body calisthenics workout that works abdominal muscles, chest, arms, legs, and several parts of the back. The subject squats down and quickly moves their arms and legs into a push-up position. Sometimes, people do a push up (not mandatory) before they finish their rep by tucking the legs in and jumping up.

* Chin-ups and pull-ups
: &quot;Chin-ups&quot; and &quot;pull-ups&quot; are similar exercises but use opposite facing grips.
: For a chin-up, the palms of the hands are facing the person as they pull up their body using the chin-up bar. The chin-up involves the biceps muscles more than the pull-up but the lats are still the primary mover.
: For a pull-up, the bar is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin level with the bar, keeping their back straight throughout the exercise. The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow, controlled manner. This primarily trains the lats, and secondary muscles working are upper back muscles, as well as the forearms and core muscles.
* Dips
: Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed, with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and deltoids, especially the anterior portion.
* Front lever and back lever
: A &quot;front lever&quot; is performed by executing a lateral pulldown of the bar with straight arms until the body is parallel to the ground, with the front of the body facing upwards. This exercise may be done on rings or a pull-up bar.
: A &quot;back lever&quot; is performed by lowering from an inverted hang from rings or bar, until the gymnast&#x27;s body is parallel to the ground and facing towards the floor.
* Handstand

: A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand, the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately a shoulder-width apart.
* Hyperextensions
: Performed in a prone position on the ground, the individual raises the legs, arms and upper body off the ground.
* Leg raises
: Lying on the back, hands in fists under buttocks, move feet up and down.
* L-sit
: The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable &quot;L&quot; shape, hence the name &quot;L-sit&quot;. The L sit requires one to keep their core tensed and holding their legs horizontal, so that their body sits in a perfect &#x27;L&#x27; position. This requires significant abdominal strength and a high level of hamstring flexibility.
* Muscle-ups
: An intermediate calisthenics exercise. Performed by a combination routine of a pull-up followed by a dip. May be done on pull-up bars or rings.
* Planche
: One of the most advanced exercises, which may be achieved after years of training. It is performed by protracting and depressing the scapula balancing the body on two arms. The planche requires a high amount of strength (particularly for taller individuals) as well as balance.
* Planks

: This is the name for holding the &#x27;top&#x27; position of a push-up for extended periods of time. The primary muscle involved in this exercise is the rectus abdominis, especially if a posterior pelvic tilt is maintained.
* Calf raises
* Lunges
* Jumping jack
: The side-straddle hop is a two-action exercise. From a standing position, the subject first jumps slightly into the air while moving the legs more than a shoulder-width apart, swinging the arms overhead, and clapping the palms together. Secondly, the subject jumps slightly into the air once again while swinging the arms down and to the side, finally returning to a standing position. Both actions must be alternated per repetition.

=== Bodyweight exercise ===
Bodyweight exercises (also called bodyweight workouts) are strength training exercises that use an individual&#x27;s own weight to provide resistance against gravity. Bodyweight exercises can enhance a range of biomotor abilities including strength, power, endurance, speed, flexibility, coordination and balance. Such strength training has become more popular among recreational and professional athletes. Bodyweight training uses simple abilities like pushing, pulling, squatting, bending, twisting and balancing. Movements such as the push-up, the pull-up, and the sit-up are among the most common bodyweight exercises.

==== Advantages ====

While some exercises may require equipment, most bodyweight exercises require none. For exercises requiring equipment, common household items (such as a bath towel for towel curls) are often sufficient, or substitutes may be improvised (for example, using a horizontal tree branch to perform pull-ups). As such, bodyweight exercises are convenient while traveling or on vacation, when access to a gym or specialized equipment may not be available. Another advantage of bodyweight training is that it entails no cost.

==== Disadvantages ====
As bodyweight exercises use an individual&#x27;s own weight to provide movement resistance, the weight being lifted is never greater than one&#x27;s own body weight, and this can limit new muscle growth. Other downsides are that bodyweight training may be daunting to novices.

==== Bodyweight exercise for older adults ====
Some bodyweight exercises have been shown to benefit not just the young, but elderly participants as well. Older people doing bodyweight exercises benefit through gains in muscle mass, in mobility, in bone density, as well as in reduced depression and improved sleep habits. It is also believed that bodyweight training may help diminish or even prevent cognitive decline as people age. In addition, the higher risk of falls seen in elderly people may be mitigated by bodyweight training. Exercises focusing on the legs and abdomen such as squats, lunges, and step ups are recommended to increase leg and core strength, in doing so, reduce the risk of falling. Bodyweight exercises provide multi-directional movement that mimics daily activities, and as such can be preferable to using weight machines.

== Training methods ==

Calisthenics can be used as a means to pursue a number of fitness goals including, but not limited to hypertrophy (increasing one&#x27;s muscle mass), strength, and endurance.

The training methods employed are often different, depending on the goal. For instance, when pursuing hypertrophy, one aims to increase the load volume over time; when pursuing strength, the intensity of the exercise is increased over time; and to improve endurance, one can gradually shorten their rest periods.

Calisthenics can be used to increase bone density, increasing core control, reducing stiffness but not just limited to it.

== Co-operative calisthenics ==

Co-operative calisthenics refers to calisthenic exercises that involve two or more participants helping each other to perform the exercise. Such exercises may also be known as partner exercises, partner-resisted exercises, partner carrying, or bodyweight exercises with a partner. They have been used for centuries as a way of building physical strength, endurance, mobility, and co-ordination. Usually, one person performs the exercise and the other person adds resistance. For example, a person performing squats with someone on their back, or someone holding another person in their arms and walking around. Some exercises also involve the use of equipment. Two people may hold onto different ends of a rope and pull in different directions. One person would deliberately provide a lesser amount of resistance, which adds resistance to the exercise whilst also allowing the other person to move through a full range of motion as their superior level of force application pulls the rope along. A disadvantage of these exercises is that it can be challenging to measure how much resistance is being added by the partner, when considered in comparison to free weights or machines. An advantage such exercise has is that it allows for relatively high levels of resistance to be added with equipment being optional. On this basis, co-operative calisthenics can be just as easily performed on a playing field as in a gym. They are also versatile enough to allow them to be used for training goals other than simple strength. For example, a squat with a partner can be turned into a power-focused exercise by jumping or hopping with the partner instead, or even lifting them up on one knee.

== Benefits ==
A 2017 study: &quot;The effects of a calisthenics training intervention on posture, strength and body composition&quot; found that calisthenics training is an &quot;effective training solution to improve posture, strength and body composition without the use of any major training equipment&quot;.

== History ==


Catharine Esther Beecher (1800–1878) was an American educator and author who popularized and shaped a conservative ideological movement to both elevate and entrench women&#x27;s place in the domestic sphere of American culture. She introduced calisthenics in a course of physical education and promoted it.

Disciples of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn brought their version of gymnastics to the United States, while Beecher and Dio Lewis set up physical education programs for women in the 19th century. Organized systems of calisthenics in America took a back seat to competitive sports after the Battle of the Systems, when the states mandated physical education systems. The Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s calisthenics program published in the 1960s helped to launch modern fitness culture.

Calisthenics is associated with the rapidly growing international sport called street workout. The street workout consists of athletes performing calisthenics routines in timed sessions, in front of a panel of judges. The World Street Workout &amp; Calisthenics Federation (WSWCF), based in Riga, Latvia, orchestrates the annual national championships and hosts the world championships for the sport. The World Calisthenics Organization (WCO), based in Los Angeles, California, promotes a series of competitions known globally as &quot;the Battle of the Bars&quot;. The WCO created the first set of rules for formal competitions, including weight classes, a timed round system, original judging criteria and a 10-point must system, giving an increasing number of athletes worldwide an opportunity to compete in these global competitions.

Street workout competitions have also popularized &#x27;freestyle calisthenics&#x27;, which is a style of calisthenics where the athlete uses their power and momentum to perform dynamic skills and tricks on the bar, often as part of a routine where each trick is linked together in a consistent flow. Freestyle calisthenics requires great skill to control one&#x27;s momentum and an understanding of the mechanics of the body and the bar.

== Calisthenics parks ==

Some outdoor fitness training areas and outdoor gyms are designed especially for calisthenics training, and most are free to use by the public. Calisthenics parks equipment include pull-up bars, monkey bars, parallel bars, and box jumps. Freely accessible online maps exist that show the locations and sample photos of calisthenics parks around the world.

<text>Volksmarching (from German &quot;&quot;, &quot;people&#x27;s march&quot;) is a form of non-competitive fitness walking that developed in Europe in the mid-late 1960s. By 1968, the International Federation of Popular Sports (better known as the &quot;IVV&quot;) was formed by Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. The national emblems of these four countries were placed in a wreath to form the symbol IVV. The IVV Headquarters is located in Altötting, Germany (Bavaria) and the official languages of the IVV are English and German, though French is also used unofficially.

Though walking is the primary activity, the volkssporting movement also includes bicycling, swimming, cross-country skiing or snow-shoeing, and other approved activities. Special provisions also allow for people with disabilities to participate in most events. Participants typically walk , , or longer, on a predetermined outdoor path or trail, with the aid of posted signs or markings, or a map and a set of written directions. Volksmarching associations offer incentive awards (including certificates, pins and patches) for participating in a certain number of events and for covering different cumulative distances over time. Volksmarching participants enjoy recording distances and event participation in international record books.

IVV members around the world organize more than 7,500 events each year for an estimated participation of 10,000,000 people. People of all ages and abilities participate. As of 2019, IVV Membership includes 29 National Federations (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland/Liechtenstein, Southern Tyrol, Taiwan and the United States) as well as 12 additional &quot;direct members&quot; in Andorra, CapVerde, Croatia, Ireland, Indonesia, Lithuania, New Zealand, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia and Spain—representing 4,000 local clubs and making volkssporting available in at least 40 countries worldwide. Members are loosely organized under three geographic groupings: IVV-Europe, IVV-Asia and IVV-Americas.

Less frequently used terms are &quot;&quot; and &quot;Volkswalk&quot;.

<text>Harry Shields (June 30, 1899 – January 19, 1971) was an American jazz clarinetist.

== Background ==
Shields was born in Uptown New Orleans, the younger brother of noted clarinetist Larry Shields. He spent almost his entire career in New Orleans. He played with the bands of Norman Brownlee, Sharkey Bonano, Tom Brown, Johnny Wiggs, and others. Many fellow musicians regarded Harry as superior to his more famous brother, Larry. Johnny Wiggs commented that Shields was the only clarinetist he&#x27;d heard who could always play the right note without fail.

<doc id="189037" wikidata="Q219067" url="?curid=189037" title="Exercise">
<text>Exercise or workout is physical activity that enhances or maintains fitness and overall health. which is performed for various reasons, including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, prevent injuries, hone athletic skills, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many people choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.

In terms of health benefits, usually, 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week is recommended for reducing the risk of health problems. At the same time, even doing a small amount of exercise is healthier than doing none. Only doing an hour and a quarter (11 minutes/day) of exercise could reduce the risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer.
== Classification ==

Physical exercises are generally grouped into three types, depending on the overall effect they have on the human body:
* Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting. The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular endurance. Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running.
* Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination. Examples of strength exercises are push-ups, pull-ups, lunges, squats, bench press. Anaerobic exercise also includes weight training, functional training, Eccentric Training, interval training, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training which increase short-term muscle strength.
* Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles. Activities such as stretching help to improve joint flexibility and keep muscles limber. The goal is to improve the range of motion which can reduce the chance of injury.

Physical exercise can also include training that focuses on accuracy, agility, power, and speed.

Types of exercise can also be classified as dynamic or static. &#x27;Dynamic&#x27; exercises such as steady running, tend to produce a lowering of the diastolic blood pressure during exercise, due to the improved blood flow. Conversely, static exercise (such as weight-lifting) can cause the systolic pressure to rise significantly, albeit transiently, during the performance of the exercise.

== Health effects ==

Physical exercise is important for maintaining physical fitness and can contribute to maintaining a healthy weight, regulating the digestive system, building and maintaining healthy bone density, muscle strength, and joint mobility, promoting physiological well-being, reducing surgical risks, and strengthening the immune system. Some studies indicate that exercise may increase life expectancy and the overall quality of life. People who participate in moderate to high levels of physical exercise have a lower mortality rate compared to individuals who by comparison are not physically active. Moderate levels of exercise have been correlated with preventing aging by reducing inflammatory potential. The majority of the benefits from exercise are achieved with around 3500 metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week, with diminishing returns at higher levels of activity. For example, climbing stairs 10 minutes, vacuuming 15 minutes, gardening 20 minutes, running 20 minutes, and walking or bicycling for transportation 25 minutes on a daily basis would &quot;together&quot; achieve about 3000 MET minutes a week. A lack of physical activity causes approximately 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease, 7% of type 2 diabetes, 10% of breast cancer, and 10% of colon cancer worldwide. Overall, physical inactivity causes 9% of premature mortality worldwide.

The American-British writer Bill Bryson wrote: &quot;If someone invented a pill that could do for us all that a moderate amount of exercise achieves, it would instantly become the most successful drug in history.&quot;

=== Fitness ===

Most people can increase fitness by increasing physical activity levels. Increases in muscle size from resistance training are primarily determined by diet and testosterone. This genetic variation in improvement from training is one of the key physiological differences between elite athletes and the larger population. There is evidence that exercising in middle age may lead to better physical ability later in life.

Early motor skills and development is also related to physical activity and performance later in life. Children who are more proficient with motor skills early on are more inclined to be physically active, and thus tend to perform well in sports and have better fitness levels. Early motor proficiency has a positive correlation to childhood physical activity and fitness levels, while less proficiency in motor skills results in a more sedentary lifestyle.

The type and intensity of physical activity performed may have an effect on a person&#x27;s fitness level. There is some weak evidence that high-intensity interval training may improve a person&#x27;s VO2 max slightly more than lower intensity endurance training. However, unscientific fitness methods could lead to sports injuries.

=== Cardiovascular system ===
The beneficial effect of exercise on the cardiovascular system is well documented. There is a direct correlation between physical inactivity and cardiovascular disease, and physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Low levels of physical exercise increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases mortality.

Children who participate in physical exercise experience greater loss of body fat and increased cardiovascular fitness. Studies have shown that academic stress in youth increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in later years; however, these risks can be greatly decreased with regular physical exercise.

There is a dose-response relationship between the amount of exercise performed from approximately  kcal of energy expenditure per week and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality in middle-aged and elderly men. The greatest potential for reduced mortality is seen in sedentary individuals who become moderately active.

Studies have shown that since heart disease is the leading cause of death in women, regular exercise in aging women leads to healthier cardiovascular profiles.

The most beneficial effects of physical activity on cardiovascular disease mortality can be attained through moderate-intensity activity (40–60% of maximal oxygen uptake, depending on age). After a myocardial infarction, survivors who changed their lifestyle to include regular exercise had higher survival rates. Sedentary people are most at risk for mortality from cardiovascular and all other causes. According to the American Heart Association, exercise reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attack and stroke.

Some have suggested that increases in physical exercise might decrease healthcare costs, increase the rate of job attendance, as well as increase the amount of effort women put into their jobs.

=== Immune system ===
Although there have been hundreds of studies on physical exercise and the immune system, there is little direct evidence on its connection to illness. Epidemiological evidence suggests that moderate exercise has a beneficial effect on the human immune system; an effect which is modeled in a J curve. Moderate exercise has been associated with a 29% decreased incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), but studies of marathon runners found that their prolonged high-intensity exercise was associated with an increased risk of infection occurrence. However, another study did not find the effect. Immune cell functions are impaired following acute sessions of prolonged, high-intensity exercise, and some studies have found that athletes are at a higher risk for infections. Studies have shown that strenuous stress for long durations, such as training for a marathon, can suppress the immune system by decreasing the concentration of lymphocytes. The immune systems of athletes and nonathletes are generally similar. Athletes may have a slightly elevated natural killer cell count and cytolytic action, but these are unlikely to be clinically significant.

Vitamin C supplementation has been associated with a lower incidence of upper respiratory tract infections in marathon runners.

Biomarkers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein, which are associated with chronic diseases, are reduced in active individuals relative to sedentary individuals, and the positive effects of exercise may be due to its anti-inflammatory effects. In individuals with heart disease, exercise interventions lower blood levels of fibrinogen and C-reactive protein, an important cardiovascular risk marker. The depression in the immune system following acute bouts of exercise may be one of the mechanisms for this anti-inflammatory effect.

=== Cancer ===
A systematic review evaluated 45 studies that examined the relationship between physical activity and cancer survival rates. According to the review, &quot;[there] was consistent evidence from 27 observational studies that physical activity is associated with reduced all-cause, breast cancer–specific, and colon cancer–specific mortality. There is currently insufficient evidence regarding the association between physical activity and mortality for survivors of other cancers.&quot; Evidence suggests that exercise may positively affect the quality of life in cancer survivors, including factors such as anxiety, self-esteem and emotional well-being. For people with cancer undergoing active treatment, exercise may also have positive effects on health-related quality of life, such as fatigue and physical functioning. This is likely to be more pronounced with higher intensity exercise.

Exercise may contribute to a reduction of cancer-related fatigue in survivors of breast cancer. Although there is only limited scientific evidence on the subject, people with cancer cachexia are encouraged to engage in physical exercise. Due to various factors, some individuals with cancer cachexia have a limited capacity for physical exercise. Compliance with prescribed exercise is low in individuals with cachexia and clinical trials of exercise in this population often have high drop-out rates.

There is low-quality evidence for an effect of aerobic physical exercises on anxiety and serious adverse events in adults with hematological malignancies. Aerobic physical exercise may result in little to no difference in the mortality, quality of life, or physical functioning. These exercises may result in a slight reduction in depression and reduction in fatigue.

=== Neurobiological ===
==== Depression ====
Continuous aerobic exercise can induce a transient state of euphoria, colloquially known as a &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot; in distance running or a &quot;rower&#x27;s high&quot; in crew, through the increased biosynthesis of at least three euphoriant neurochemicals: anandamide (an endocannabinoid), β-endorphin (an endogenous opioid), and phenethylamine (a trace amine and amphetamine analog).

==== Concussion ====
Supervised aerobic exercise without a risk of re-injury (falling, getting hit on the head) is prescribed as treatment for acute concussion. Some exercise interventions may also prevent sport-related concussion.

=== Sleep ===
Preliminary evidence from a 2012 review indicated that physical training for up to four months may increase sleep quality in adults over 40 years of age. A 2010 review suggested that exercise generally improved sleep for most people, and may help with insomnia, but there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. A 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that exercise can improve sleep quality in people with insomnia.

=== Libido ===
One 2013 study found that exercising improved sexual arousal problems related to antidepressant use.

=== Respiratory system ===
People who participate in physical exercise experience increased cardiovascular fitness.
There is some level of concern about additional exposure to air pollution when exercising outdoors, especially near traffic.

== Mechanism of effects ==

=== Skeletal muscle ===

Resistance training and subsequent consumption of a protein-rich meal promotes muscle hypertrophy and gains in muscle strength by stimulating myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and inhibiting muscle protein breakdown (MPB). The stimulation of muscle protein synthesis by resistance training occurs via phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and subsequent activation of mTORC1, which leads to protein biosynthesis in cellular ribosomes via phosphorylation of mTORC1&#x27;s immediate targets (the p70S6 kinase and the translation repressor protein 4EBP1). The suppression of muscle protein breakdown following food consumption occurs primarily via increases in plasma insulin. Similarly, increased muscle protein synthesis (via activation of mTORC1) and suppressed muscle protein breakdown (via insulin-independent mechanisms) has also been shown to occur following ingestion of β-hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid.

Aerobic exercise induces mitochondrial biogenesis and an increased capacity for oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle, which is one mechanism by which aerobic exercise enhances submaximal endurance performance. These effects occur via an exercise-induced increase in the intracellular AMP:ATP ratio, thereby triggering the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which subsequently phosphorylates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.
=== Other peripheral organs ===

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as myokines which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and multiple anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases. Exercise reduces levels of cortisol, which causes many health problems, both physical and mental. Endurance exercise before meals lowers blood glucose more than the same exercise after meals. There is evidence that vigorous exercise (90–95% of VO2 max) induces a greater degree of physiological cardiac hypertrophy than moderate exercise (40 to 70% of VO2 max), but it is unknown whether this has any effects on overall morbidity and/or mortality. Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise work to increase the mechanical efficiency of the heart by increasing cardiac volume (aerobic exercise), or myocardial thickness (strength training). Ventricular hypertrophy, the thickening of the ventricular walls, is generally beneficial and healthy if it occurs in response to exercise.

=== Central nervous system ===

The effects of physical exercise on the central nervous system may be mediated in part by specific neurotrophic factor hormones released into the blood by muscles, including BDNF, IGF-1, and VEGF.

== Public health measures ==
Community-wide and school campaigns are often used in an attempt to increase a population&#x27;s level of physical activity. Studies to determine the effectiveness of these types of programs need to be interpreted cautiously as the results vary. There is some evidence that certain types of exercise programmes for older adults, such as those involving gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks, can improve balance. Following progressive resistance training, older adults also respond with improved physical function. Brief interventions promoting physical activity may be cost-effective, however this evidence is weak and there are variations between studies.

Environmental approaches appear promising: signs that encourage the use of stairs, as well as community campaigns, may increase exercise levels. The city of Bogotá, Colombia, for example, blocks off of roads on Sundays and holidays to make it easier for its citizens to get exercise. Such pedestrian zones are part of an effort to combat chronic diseases and to maintain a healthy BMI.

Parents can promote physical activity by modelling healthy levels of physical activity or by encouraging physical activity. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity each day. Implementing physical exercise in the school system and ensuring an environment in which children can reduce barriers to maintain a healthy lifestyle is essential.

The European Commission&#x27;s Directorate-General for Education and Culture (DG EAC) has dedicated programs and funds for Health Enhancing Physical Activity (HEPA) projects within its Horizon 2020 and Erasmus+ program, as research showed that too many Europeans are not physically active enough. Financing is available for increased collaboration between players active in this field across the EU and around the world, the promotion of HEPA in the EU and its partner countries, and the European Sports Week. The DG EAC regularly publishes a Eurobarometer on sport and physical activity.

== Exercise trends ==
Worldwide there has been a large shift toward less physically demanding work. This has been accompanied by increasing use of mechanized transportation, a greater prevalence of labor-saving technology in the home, and fewer active recreational pursuits. Personal lifestyle changes, however, can correct the lack of physical exercise.

Research published in 2015 suggests that incorporating mindfulness into physical exercise interventions increases exercise adherence and self-efficacy, and also has positive effects both psychologically and physiologically.

=== Social and cultural variation ===
Exercising looks different in every country, as do the motivations behind exercising. In some countries, people exercise primarily indoors (such as at home or health clubs), while in others, people primarily exercise outdoors. People may exercise for personal enjoyment, health and well-being, social interactions, competition or training, etc. These differences could potentially be attributed to a variety of reasons including geographic location and social tendencies.

In Colombia, for example, citizens value and celebrate the outdoor environments of their country. In many instances, they use outdoor activities as social gatherings to enjoy nature and their communities. In Bogotá, Colombia, a 70-mile stretch of road known as the Ciclovía is shut down each Sunday for bicyclists, runners, rollerbladers, skateboarders and other exercisers to work out and enjoy their surroundings.

Similarly to Colombia, citizens of Cambodia tend to exercise socially outside. In this country, public gyms have become quite popular. People will congregate at these outdoor gyms not only to use the public facilities, but also to organize aerobics and dance sessions, which are open to the public.

Sweden has also begun developing outdoor gyms, called &quot;utegym&quot;. These gyms are free to the public and are often placed in beautiful, picturesque environments. People will swim in rivers, use boats, and run through forests to stay healthy and enjoy the natural world around them. This works particularly well in Sweden due to its geographical location.

Exercise in some areas of China, particularly among those who are retired, seems to be socially grounded. In the mornings, square dances are held in public parks; these gatherings may include Latin dancing, ballroom dancing, tango, or even the jitterbug. Dancing in public allows people to interact with those with whom they would not normally interact, allowing for both health and social benefits.

These sociocultural variations in physical exercise show how people in different geographic locations and social climates have varying motivations and methods of exercising. Physical exercise can improve health and well-being, as well as enhance community ties and appreciation of natural beauty.

=== Adherence ===
Adhering or staying consistent with an exercise program can be challenging for many people. Studies have identified many different factors. Some factors include why a person is exercising (e.g, health, social), what types of exercises or how the exercise program is structured, whether or not professionals are involved in the program, education related to exercise and health, monitoring and progress made in exercise program, goals setting, and involved a person is in choosing the exercise program and setting goals.

== Nutrition and recovery ==
Proper nutrition is as important to health as exercise. When exercising, it becomes even more important to have a good diet to ensure that the body has the correct ratio of macronutrients while providing ample micronutrients, to aid the body with the recovery process following strenuous exercise.

Active recovery is recommended after participating in physical exercise because it removes lactate from the blood more quickly than inactive recovery. Removing lactate from circulation allows for an easy decline in body temperature, which can also benefit the immune system, as an individual may be vulnerable to minor illnesses if the body temperature drops too abruptly after physical exercise. Exercise physiologists recommend the &quot;4-Rs framework&quot;:
;Rehydration
:Replacing any fluid and electrolyte deficits
;Refuel
:Consuming carbohydrates to replenish muscle and liver glycogen
;Repair
:Consuming high-quality protein sources with additional supplementation of creatine monohydrate
;Rest
:Getting long and high-quality sleep after exercise, additionally improved by consuming casein proteins, antioxidant-rich fruits, and high-glycemic-index meals

Exercise has an effect on appetite, but whether it increases or decreases appetite varies from individual to individual, and is affected by the intensity and duration of the exercise.

== Excessive exercise ==
== History ==

The benefits of exercise have been known since antiquity. Dating back to 65 BCE, it was Marcus Cicero, Roman politician and lawyer, who stated: &quot;It is exercise alone that supports the spirits, and keeps the mind in vigor.&quot; Exercise was also seen to be valued later in history during the Early Middle Ages as a means of survival by the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe.

More recently, exercise was regarded as a beneficial force in the 19th century. In 1858, Archibald MacLaren opened a gymnasium at the University of Oxford and instituted a training regimen for Major Frederick Hammersley and 12 non-commissioned officers. This regimen was assimilated into the training of the British Army, which formed the Army Gymnastic Staff in 1860 and made sport an important part of military life. Several mass exercise movements were started in the early twentieth century as well. The first and most significant of these in the UK was the Women&#x27;s League of Health and Beauty, founded in 1930 by Mary Bagot Stack, that had 166,000 members in 1937.

The link between physical health and exercise (or lack of it) was further established in 1949 and reported in 1953 by a team led by Jerry Morris. Morris noted that men of similar social class and occupation (bus conductors versus bus drivers) had markedly different rates of heart attacks, depending on the level of exercise they got: bus drivers had a sedentary occupation and a higher incidence of heart disease, while bus conductors were forced to move continually and had a lower incidence of heart disease.

== Other animals ==
Animals like chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas and bonobos, which are closely related to humans, without ill effect engage in considerably less physical activity than is required for human health, raising the question of how this is biochemically possible.

Studies of animals indicate that physical activity may be more adaptable than changes in food intake to regulate energy balance.

Mice having access to activity wheels engaged in voluntary exercise and increased their propensity to run as adults. Artificial selection of mice exhibited significant heritability in voluntary exercise levels, with &quot;high-runner&quot; breeds having enhanced aerobic capacity, hippocampal neurogenesis, and skeletal muscle morphology.

The effects of exercise training appear to be heterogeneous across non-mammalian species. As examples, exercise training of salmon showed minor improvements of endurance, and a forced swimming regimen of yellowtail amberjack and rainbow trout accelerated their growth rates and altered muscle morphology favorable for sustained swimming. Crocodiles, alligators, and ducks showed elevated aerobic capacity following exercise training. No effect of endurance training was found in most studies of lizards, although one study did report a training effect. In lizards, sprint training had no effect on maximal exercise capacity, and muscular damage from over-training occurred following weeks of forced treadmill exercise.

<text>Joseph Gustaf &quot;Sharkey&quot; Bonano (April 9, 1904 – March 27, 1972), also known as Sharkey Banana or Sharkey Bananas, was an American jazz trumpeter, band leader, and vocalist. His musical abilities were sometimes overlooked because of his love of being an entertainer; he would often sing silly lyrics in a high raspy voice and break into dance on stage.

==Biography==
Bonano was born in the Milneburg neighborhood of New Orleans near Lake Pontchartrain. In the 1920s he was in the New Orleans bands of Freddie Newman and Chink Martin. After moving to New York City, he found work as a member of the Wolverines and with Jimmy Durante. He worked next to Frankie Trumbauer and Bix Beiderbecke as a member the Jean Goldkette orchestra. At the end of the 1920s, he led a band which included Louis Prima. During the 1930s he formed the Sharks of Rhythm and played in the Original Dixieland Jass Band. His sidemen during this period included Santo Pecora and Thurman Teague.

After World War II he toured Europe, Asia, and South America, played residencies in Chicago and New York, and then was a regular on Bourbon Street in the New Orleans French Quarter. In 1949, he appeared at the Roosevelt Hotel&#x27;s Blue Room and the Famous Door Bar.

Bonano died on March 27, 1972, at the age of 67.

<text>USS &quot;Bang&quot; (SS-385) was a United States Navy , named after the bang, a dark blue or black fish of the Atlantic herring family found in the coastal waters of the United States north of North Carolina.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bang&quot; was laid down on 30 April 1943 at Kittery, Maine, by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard; launched on 30 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Robert W. Neblett; and commissioned on 4 December 1943, Lt. Cmdr. Antone R. Gallaher in command.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===

====World War II====
Following four weeks of shakedown training off New England, the submarine departed New London, Conn. on 8 February 1944 and headed for the Pacific. After transiting the Panama Canal, she proceeded to Pearl Harbor for intensified training in torpedo approaches, evasive maneuvers, and simulated warfare. As March came to an end, &quot;Bang&quot; was fully provisioned and ready for battle.

On the 29th, she departed Pearl Harbor in company with and for her first war patrol. After a one-day fueling stop at Midway Atoll, the trio continued to their patrol area in Luzon Strait and waters southwest of Formosa.

The three submarines exchanged contact information and coordinated attack plans throughout the patrol. On 29 April, &quot;Bang&quot; sighted a 12-ship, southbound convoy. After maneuvering into a favorable position, she fired her torpedoes into the convoy, sinking &quot;Takegawa Maru&quot;. The submarine continued to hound the convoy during the night and, the following morning, sank &quot;Nittatsu Maru&quot;. The enemy rained down depth charges on &quot;Bang&quot;, but training in evasive maneuvers and a bit of good luck enabled her to escape damage.

Tinosa sighted a northbound Japanese convoy on 3 May, and &quot;Bang&quot; moved in to pursue its 10 ships. Her first attempt to attack during daylight was foiled by enemy plane and surface escorts which forced her to dive. After dark, she and her colleagues coordinated a surface attack in which &quot;Bang&quot; sank &quot;Kinrei Maru&quot;, and claimed the destruction of a destroyer, which was not confirmed by postwar study of Japanese records. Since all of her torpedoes had been expended, &quot;Bang&quot; departed the area on 6 May and arrived at Midway on the 14th for refit alongside .

On 6 June, &quot;Bang&quot; put to sea on her second war patrol, the timing of which coincided with the preliminaries to the Mariana Islands invasion. Consequently, she was assigned to waters to the west of that island group so that she would be in position to intercept any Japanese warships or transports steaming eastward to parry the American offensive thrust. While en route to her station, the submarine encountered a lone northbound tanker on 14 June. Although hampered by heavy rain squalls and turbulent seas, &quot;Bang&quot; launched a spread of three torpedoes, one of which hit and damaged the target, but did not sink her. The submarine could not finish off this enemy ship because her orders required her to take station as soon as possible.

Marines landed on Saipan on the 15th, and that event goaded the Japanese Mobile Fleet to make a desperate attempt to turn back this Allied threat to the Emperor&#x27;s inner defense line, in which the Marianas acted as a major link, if not the keystone. &quot;Bang&quot; reached her station that same day but spent an uneventful week while Admiral Raymond Spruance&#x27;s 5th Fleet was trouncing the Japanese task force in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, virtually wiping out the enemy&#x27;s naval air capability for the remainder of the war.

On 22 June, the day after that epic engagement ended, she rendezvoused with and off Formosa to form a coordinated attack group. &quot;Growler&quot; was detached just one day before the unit&#x27;s run in with southbound convoy Hi-67 of more than 15 ships. &quot;Bang&quot; made a submerged attack and fired 10 torpedoes at three overlapping targets, all of which the submarine claims to have sunk, although the postwar records do not confirm the claim. The enemy escorts turned and pursued &quot;Bang&quot;, dropping 125 depth charges over her as she went deep to avoid destruction. When &quot;Bang&quot; finally surfaced, the convoy was disappearing over the horizon.

On 4 July, &quot;Bang&quot; sighted a small Hong Kong-bound convoy consisting of one cargo ship and four destroyer escorts. She approached the convoy on the surface, but before she could maneuver into a good attack position, an alert escort began to search for the attacker. &quot;Bang&quot; launched three torpedoes without making adequate attack solutions, and all three missed their targets. The submarine was forced to dive and maneuver to avoid the depth charges dropped by the escort and was unable to mount another attack.

On 17 July, the ship headed back to Pearl Harbor for refit, which continued into the last week of August. She left Pearl Harbor again on the 27th, refueled at Midway on 31 August, and continued to waters northeast of Formosa off the Nansei Shoto. While passing northwest of the Bonin Islands to take up her station, &quot;Bang&quot; encountered an enemy convoy on 9 September. Diving to make a periscope attack, she fired a salvo at two loaded freighters, both of which – &quot;Tokiwasan Maru&quot; and &quot;Shoryu Maru&quot; – disintegrated due to internal explosions triggered by the hits. The escorts evidently sighted &quot;Bang&quot;″s periscope and torpedo wakes, because as she dove deep, the depth charges accurately drove her down beyond her test depth to , where depth control almost disappeared. A pattern of 16 charges exploded directly over the boat, but &quot;Bang&quot; waited out her enemies. The escorts departed apparently satisfied that they had scored a kill, but &quot;Bang&quot; suffered only minor damage which her crew easily repaired. Three days later, she arrived on station.

Early on 19 September, &quot;Bang&quot; made radar contact on another enemy convoy, submerged, and fired on two of the ships. &quot;Tosei Maru No. 2&quot; sank, while the other ship suffered substantial damage. Working as a team, three enemy escorts systematically depth bombed the submarine, but she again successfully outmaneuvered her pursuers and surfaced after dark.

While submerged on the afternoon of 20 September, she encountered an eastbound convoy and shadowed it until darkness fell to cover her attack. She surfaced, fired her remaining 10 torpedoes, and claimed to have sunk a large tanker and a medium freighter as well as damaging another ship. The next day, she headed for Midway and refit.

Repaired, refueled, and replenished, &quot;Bang&quot; got underway again on 25 October and, with and , returned to the same area. Typhoon weather precluded effective operations during the early part of the fourth war patrol. Finally, on 22 November, improved weather enabled &quot;Bang&quot; to attack a convoy initially reported by &quot;Redfish&quot;. Between midnight and 0300 on the 23d, all three submarines conducted coordinated attacks on the convoy. &quot;Bang&quot; fired all 24 of her torpedoes in a series of seven surface attacks, sinking two cargo ships – &quot;Sakae Maru&quot; and &quot;Amakusa Maru&quot;. She reported also destroying a minelayer escort and another freighter, but Japanese records did not corroborate these kills. Between the three submarines, the convoy was totally destroyed.

Later that day, &quot;Bang&quot; headed for Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 5 December for refit. Following a restful holiday period, the submarine departed Oahu on 2 January 1945 and set a course for Saipan. There, on 15 January, she joined with , , and and sailed for a patrol area in the East China and Yellow Seas. Bad weather and a scarcity of targets denied &quot;Bang&quot; opportunities to attack any enemy shipping before she departed the area on 19 February, without any kills. She arrived at Guam on the 24th for refit alongside &quot;Proteus&quot;.

&quot;Bang&quot;″s sixth and last patrol began on 25 March when she got underway for Luzon Strait. After 10 days of patrol, she was ordered to take lifeguard station northeast of Formosa during strikes on northern Formosa and the southern Ryukyu Islands in support of the Allied struggle for Okinawa. On 21 April, &quot;Bang&quot; rescued a Navy pilot who had ditched his plane after it had been damaged by flak during a strafing run.

On 3 May, the submarine received orders to return to Hawaii. She refueled at Saipan and continued on to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 18 May. After 10 days of recreation and inspection of the boat, additional orders sent her back to the United States for overhaul at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She stopped at San Francisco Naval Shipyard, then continued on through the Panama Canal and up the Atlantic coast to Portsmouth where she arrived on 22 June. The submarine was still undergoing overhaul when hostilities ended. Following completion of the overhaul, &quot;Bang&quot; operated out of New London in the early postwar period. She was placed out of commission on 12 February 1947 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

====Post-War====
On 1 February 1951, &quot;Bang&quot; was recommissioned at the U.S. Naval Submarine Base, New London, Lieutenant Commander Eugene A. Hemley in command, but spent only 15 months on active duty with the Atlantic Fleet before being decommissioned again on 15 May 1952 for conversion and modernization. Following work at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, &quot;Bang&quot; was recommissioned as a GUPPY IIA submarine, the first of her type to serve the U.S. Navy, on 4 October 1952. Although her outward appearance remained the same, &quot;Bang&quot;″s internal arrangements were improved and incorporated impressive advances in ordnance and electronic gear. Her hull was streamlined and additional power added to the engineering plant to provide increased submerged speed.

After operating with the fleet in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea for two years, &quot;Bang&quot; entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a routine overhaul in August 1954. Upon completion of the overhaul in December, she rejoined the fleet with still more modern equipment. The submarine carried out normal operations along the eastern seaboard primarily engaged in training missions with other submarines and with surface antisubmarine units. She left her home port of New London in July 1957 to begin another overhaul in Portsmouth. When she came out in January 1958, she resumed peacetime operations, including a midshipmen training cruise during the summer of 1958 to Spain and Denmark, a four-month deployment to the Mediterranean and northern Europe in 1962, deployment to the Mediterranean from early January through early May 1965, and participation in Operation &quot;Springboard&quot; in the Caribbean in 1966. Between these cruises and major yard work in 1961, 1962, 1966, 1967, and 1970, &quot;Bang&quot; provided training services to Basic Submarine School in New London as well as to units of the Atlantic Fleet.

===Spanish Navy===
Early in 1972, &quot;Bang&quot; was designated for transfer to the Spanish Navy on a five-year loan. Following upkeep to lengthen her safe submerged operations limit, &quot;Bang&quot; returned to New London to train Spanish sailors in preparation for the transfer. On 1 October 1972, &quot;Bang&quot; was decommissioned and transferred to the Spanish government. She was recommissioned as Cosme Garcia (S34). On 1 November 1974, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register and the transfer to Spain was made permanent by sale.

==Awards==
&quot;Bang&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service. She is officially credited with sinking eight Japanese merchant ships totaling 20,177 tons.

<doc id="189042" wikidata="Q8035383" url="?curid=189042" title="World Atlantic Airlines">
<text>Caribbean Sun Airlines Inc., trading as World Atlantic Airlines is an airline in the United States operating on-demand and scheduled charter services. Its corporate headquarters are located in Virginia Gardens, Florida.

==History==
The airline was founded in September 2002 as &quot;Caribbean Sun Airlines&quot; in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and began operations in January 2003 with flights from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Tortola, using the Bombardier Dash 8 Q100. On the flights, Caribbean Sun cooperated with the Antiguan sister company Caribbean Star Airlines, which also belonged to the Stanford Financial Group and enabled connecting flights to other Caribbean islands.

Flight operations ceased towards the end of January 2007. The resumption of the same under the name &quot;Merengue Airlines Dominicana&quot;, which was sought after a subsequent change of ownership was also unsuccessful, and so Caribbean Sun Airlines was finally sold to Tomas Romero, who renamed the company to &quot;World Atlantic Airlines&quot;. The company, which from then on only operates under this name, then focused on the ACMI charter area.

World Atlantic was one of the charter providers to Myrtle Beach Direct Air until the airline&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2012, and was fined by the Department of Transportation in 2012 for regulatory violations in connection with this business. Since 2013, World Atlantic has acted as a charter provider to the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation of individuals from the United States and recently per the NY Post delivering immigrants to Westchester, NY.

In April 2013, World Atlantic transported Venezuelan voters from Miami to New Orleans to vote in the Venezuelan presidential election.

In September 2017, World Atlantic Airlines also entered into a partnership with Venezuelan airline Avior Airlines, having previously worked with LASER Airlines as part of the ACMI charter. As part of the business relationship with Avior Airlines, World Atlantic operated ACMI charter flights to Fort Lauderdale and Miami.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===

As of May 2024, World Atlantic Airlines operates the following aircraft:

===Former fleet===
World Atlantic Airlines formerly operated the following aircraft:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On April 20, 2018, A McDonnell Douglas MD-83 (registration N807WA) suffered a right-hand main landing gear collapsed during landing rollout at Alexandria International Airport, in Louisiana, USA. Due to the gear failure, the right wing dragged on the runway, creating a friction fire which was quickly put out by the airport rescue and firefighting personnel. The aircraft operated on a flight on behalf of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and originated from Chicago-O&#x27;Hare International Airport. None of the 101 passengers on board were injured, but the aircraft suffered significant damage and was later written off as irreparable.
*On July 10, 2024, A McDonnell Douglas MD-83, (registration N804WA), operating as Flight WAL101, experienced an in-flight emergency shortly after takeoff from El Paso International Airport (KELP) en route to McAllen Miller International Airport (KMFE). The aircraft declared a MAYDAY after reporting a right engine failure and requested an immediate return to El Paso, Texas. Approximately four minutes after departure, the aircraft landed safely on runway 26L at El Paso International Airport and subsequently vacated the runway. Upon landing, the flight crew was informed that the right engine had caught fire.

<doc id="189043" wikidata="Q1132131" url="?curid=189043" title="Loyalty">
<text>Loyalty is a devotion to a country, philosophy, group, or person. Philosophers disagree on what can be an object of loyalty, as some argue that loyalty is strictly interpersonal and only another human being can be the object of loyalty. The definition of loyalty in law and political science is the fidelity of an individual to a nation, either one&#x27;s nation of birth, or one&#x27;s declared home nation by oath (naturalization).

==Historical concepts==

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition defines loyalty as &quot;allegiance to the sovereign or established government of one&#x27;s country&quot; and also &quot;personal devotion and reverence to the sovereign and royal family&quot;. It traces the word &quot;&quot; to the 15th century, noting that then it primarily referred to fidelity in service, in love, or to an oath that one has made. The meaning that the &quot;Britannica&quot; gives as primary, it attributes to a shift during the 16th century, noting that the origin of the word is in the Old French , that is in turn rooted in the Latin , meaning &quot;&quot;. One who is loyal, in the feudal sense of fealty, is one who is lawful (as opposed to an outlaw), who has full legal rights as a consequence of faithful allegiance to a feudal lord. Hence the 1911 &quot;Britannica&quot; derived its (early 20th century) primary meaning of loyalty to a monarch.

&quot;Loyalty&quot; is the most important and frequently emphasized virtue in Bushido. In combination with six other virtues, which are Righteousness (), Courage (), Benevolence, (), Respect (), Sincerity (), and Honour (), it formed the Bushido code: &quot;It is somehow implanted in their chromosomal makeup to be loyal&quot;. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus states, &quot;No one can serve two masters; for a slave will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth&quot;. On the other hand, the &quot;Render unto Caesar&quot; of the synoptic gospels acknowledges the possibility of distinct loyalties (secular and religious) without conflict, but if loyalty to man conflicts with loyalty to God, the latter takes precedence.

==Modern concepts==

Josiah Royce presented a different definition of the concept in his 1908 book &quot;The Philosophy of Loyalty&quot;. According to Royce, loyalty is a virtue, indeed a primary virtue, &quot;the heart of all the virtues, the central duty amongst all the duties&quot;. Royce presents loyalty, which he defines at length, as the basic moral principle from which all other principles can be derived. The short definition that he gives of the idea is that loyalty is &quot;the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause&quot;. Loyalty is thoroughgoing in that it is not merely a casual interest but a wholehearted commitment to a cause.

Royce&#x27;s view of loyalty was challenged by John Ladd, professor of philosophy at Brown University, in the article on &quot;Loyalty&quot; in the first edition of the Macmillan &quot;Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; (1967). Ladd observed that by that time the subject had received &quot;scant attention in philosophical literature&quot;. This he attributed to &quot;odious&quot; associations that the subject had with nationalism, including Nazism, and with the metaphysics of idealism, which he characterized as &quot;obsolete&quot;. However, he argued that such associations were faulty and that the notion of loyalty is &quot;an essential ingredient in any civilized and humane system of morals&quot;.

Anthony Ralls observes that Ladd&#x27;s article is that &quot;Encyclopaedia&quot;″s only article on a virtue, . Ladd asserts that, contrary to Royce, causes to which one is loyal are interpersonal, not impersonal or suprapersonal. He states that Royce&#x27;s view has &quot;the ethical defect of postulating duties over and above our individual duties to men and groups of men. The individual is submerged and lost in this superperson for its tends to dissolve our specific duties to others into &#x27;superhuman&#x27; good&quot;. Ronald F. Duska, the Lamont Post Chair of Ethics and the Professions at The American College, extends Ladd&#x27;s objection, saying that it is a perversion of ethics and virtue for one&#x27;s self-will to be identified with anything, as Royce would have it. Even if one were identifying one&#x27;s self-will with God, to be worthy of such loyalty God would have to be the &quot;summum bonum&quot;, the perfect manifestation of good.

Ladd himself characterizes loyalty as interpersonal, i.e., a relationship between a lord and vassal, parent and child, or two good friends. Duska states that this characterization leads to a problem that Ladd overlooks. Loyalty may certainly be between two persons, but it may also be from a person to a group of people. Examples of this, which are unequivocally considered to be instances of loyalty, are loyalty by a person to his or her family, to a team that he or she is a member or fan of, or to his or her country. The problem is that it then becomes unclear whether there is a strict interpersonal relationship involved, and whether Ladd&#x27;s contention that loyalty is interpersonal—not suprapersonal—is an adequate description. Ladd considers loyalty from two perspectives: its proper object and its moral value.

John Kleinig, professor of philosophy at City University of New York, observes that over the years the idea has been treated by writers from Aeschylus through John Galsworthy to Joseph Conrad, by psychologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, scholars of religion, political economists, scholars of business and marketing, and—most particularly—by political theorists, who deal with it in terms of loyalty oaths and patriotism. As a philosophical concept, loyalty was largely untreated by philosophers until the work of Josiah Royce, the &quot;grand exception&quot; in Kleinig&#x27;s words. Kleinig observes that from the 1980s onwards, the subject gained attention, with philosophers variously relating it to professional ethics, whistleblowing, friendship, and virtue theory. Additional aspects enumerated by Kleinig include the exclusionary nature of loyalty and its subjects.

=== Object of loyalty ===
Ladd and others, including Milton R. Konvitz and Marcia W. Baron, disagree about the proper &quot;object of&quot; loyalty—what it is possible to be loyal &quot;to&quot;. Ladd considers loyalty to be interpersonal: the object of loyalty is always a person. In the &quot;Encyclopaedia of the History of Ideas&quot;, Konvitz states that the objects of loyalty encompass principles, causes, ideas, ideals, religions, ideologies, nations, governments, parties, leaders, families, friends, regions, racial groups, and &quot;anyone or anything to which one&#x27;s heart can become attached or devoted&quot;. Baron agrees with Ladd, inasmuch as loyalty is &quot;to certain people or to a group of people, not loyalty to an ideal or cause&quot;. She argues in her monograph, &quot;The Moral Status of Loyalty&quot;, that &quot;[w]hen we speak of causes (or ideals) we are more apt to say that people are committed to them or devoted to them than that they are loyal to them&quot;. Kleinig agrees with Baron, noting that a person&#x27;s earliest and strongest loyalties are almost always to people, and that only later do people arrive at abstract notions like values, causes, and ideals. He disagrees, however, with the notion that loyalties are restricted &quot;solely&quot; to personal attachments, considering it &quot;incorrect (as a matter of logic)&quot;.

Loyalty to people and abstract notions such as causes or ideals is considered an evolutionary tactic, as there is a greater chance of survival and procreation if animals belong to loyal packs.

Immanuel Kant constructed the basis for an ethical law via the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue can be used to achieve immoral ends (for example, the virtue of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person). The &quot;good will&quot; is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the &quot;good will&quot; as a single moral principle that freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.

=== Multiplicity, disloyalty, and whether loyalty is exclusionary ===
Stephen Nathanson, professor of philosophy at Northeastern University, states that loyalty can be either &quot;exclusionary&quot; or &quot;non-exclusionary&quot;; and can be &quot;single&quot; or &quot;multiple&quot;. Exclusionary loyalty excludes loyalties to other people or groups; whereas non-exclusionary loyalty does not. People may have single loyalties, to just one person, group, or thing, or multiple loyalties to multiple objects. Multiple loyalties can constitute a &quot;disloyalty&quot; to an object if one of those loyalties is &quot;exclusionary&quot;, excluding one of the others. However, Nathanson observes, this is a special case. In the general case, the existence of multiple loyalties does not cause a disloyalty. One can, for example, be loyal to one&#x27;s friends, or one&#x27;s family, and still, without contradiction, be loyal to one&#x27;s religion, or profession.

=== Other dimensions ===
In addition to &quot;number&quot; and &quot;exclusion&quot; as just outlined, Nathanson enumerates five other &quot;dimensions&quot; that loyalty can vary along: basis, strength, scope, legitimacy, and attitude:

; &quot;basis&quot; : Loyalties may be constructed on the basis of unalterable facts that constitute a personal connection between the subject and the object of the loyalty, such as biological ties or place of birth (a notion of natural allegiance propounded by Socrates in his political theory). Alternatively, they may be constructed from personal choice and evaluation of criteria with a full degree of freedom. The degree of control that one has is not necessarily simple; Nathanson points out that whilst one has no choice as to one&#x27;s parents or relatives, one &quot;can&quot; choose to desert them.

; &quot;strength&quot; : Loyalties can range from supreme loyalties, that override all other considerations, to merely presumptive loyalties, that affect one&#x27;s presumptions, providing but one motivation for action that is weighed against other motivations. Nathanson observes that strength of loyalty is often interrelated with basis. &quot;Blood is thicker than water&quot; is an aphorism that explains that loyalties that have biological ties as their bases are generally stronger.

; &quot;scope&quot; : Loyalties with limited scope require few actions of the subject; loyalties with broad or even unlimited scopes require many actions, or indeed to do whatever may be necessary in support of the loyalty. Loyalty to one&#x27;s job, for example, may require no more action than simple punctuality and performance of the tasks that the job requires. Loyalty to a family member can, in contrast, have a very broad effect upon one&#x27;s actions, requiring considerable personal sacrifice. Extreme patriotic loyalty may impose an unlimited scope of duties. Scope encompasses an element of &quot;constraint&quot;. Where two or more loyalties conflict, their scopes determine what weight to give to the alternative courses of action required by each loyalty.

; &quot;legitimacy&quot; : This is of particular relevance to the conflicts among multiple loyalties. People with one loyalty can hold that another, conflicting, loyalty is either legitimate or illegitimate. In the extreme view, one that Nathanson ascribes to religious extremists and xenophobes for examples, all loyalties bar one&#x27;s own are considered illegitimate. The xenophobe does not regard the loyalties of foreigners to their countries as legitimate while the religious extremist does not acknowledge the legitimacy of other religions. At the other end of the spectrum, past the middle ground of considering some loyalties as legitimate and others not, according to cases, or plain and simple indifference to other people&#x27;s loyalties, is the positive regard of other people&#x27;s loyalties.

; &quot;attitude&quot; : The subjects of the loyalties have attitudes towards other people (note that this dimension of loyalty concerns the &quot;subjects&quot; of the loyalty, whereas legitimacy, above, concerns the loyalties themselves). People may have one of a range of possible attitudes towards others who do not share their loyalties, with hate and disdain at one end, indifference in the middle, and concern and positive feeling at the other.

==In relation to other subjects==

===Patriotism===
Nathanson observes that loyalty is often directly equated to patriotism. He states that this is a false equality; while patriots exhibit loyalty, it is not conversely the case that all loyal persons are patriots. He provides the example of a mercenary soldier, who exhibits loyalty to the people or country that pays him. Nathanson points to the difference in motivations between a loyal mercenary and a patriot. A mercenary may well be motivated by a sense of professionalism or a belief in the sanctity of contracts. A patriot, in contrast, may be motivated by affection, concern, identification, and a willingness to sacrifice.

Nathanson contends that patriotic loyalty is not always a virtue. A loyal person can, in general be relied upon, and hence people view loyalty as virtuous. Nathanson argues that loyalty can, however, be given to persons or causes that are unworthy. Moreover, loyalty can lead patriots to support policies that are immoral and inhumane. Thus, Nathanson argues, patriotic loyalty can sometimes rather be a vice than a virtue, when its consequences exceed the boundaries of what is otherwise morally desirable. Such loyalties, in Nathanson&#x27;s view, are erroneously &quot;unlimited&quot; in their scopes, and fail to acknowledge boundaries of morality.

===Employment===

The faithless servant doctrine is a doctrine under the laws of a number of states in the United States, and most notably New York State law, pursuant to which an employee who acts unfaithfully towards his employer must forfeit all of the compensation he received during the period of his disloyalty.

===Whistleblowing===

Several scholars, including Duska, discuss loyalty in the context of whistleblowing. Wim Vandekerckhove of the University of Greenwich points out that in the late 20th century saw the rise of a notion of a &quot;bidirectional&quot; loyalty—between employees and their employer. (Previous thinking had encompassed the idea that employees are loyal to an employer, but not that an employer need be loyal to employees.) The ethics of whistleblowing thus encompass a conflicting multiplicity of loyalties, where the traditional loyalty of the employee to the employer conflicts with the loyalty of the employee to his or her community, which the employer&#x27;s business practices may be adversely affecting. Vandekerckhove reports that different scholars resolve the conflict in different ways, some of which he does not find to be satisfactory. Duska resolves the conflict by asserting that there is really only one proper object of loyalty in such instances—the community—a position that Vandekerckhove counters by arguing that businesses are in need of employee loyalty.

John Corvino, associate professor of philosophy at Wayne State University takes a different tack, arguing that loyalty can sometimes be a vice, not a virtue, and that &quot;loyalty is only a virtue to the extent that the object of loyalty is good&quot; (similar to Nathanson). Vandekerckhove calls this argument &quot;interesting&quot; but &quot;too vague&quot; in its description of how tolerant an employee should be of an employer&#x27;s shortcomings. Vandekerckhove suggests that Duska and Corvino combine, however, to point in a direction that makes it possible to resolve the conflict of loyalties in the context of whistleblowing, by clarifying the objects of those loyalties.

===Marketing===

Businesses seek to become the objects of loyalty in order to retain customers. Brand loyalty is a consumer&#x27;s preference for a particular brand and a commitment to repeatedly purchase that brand. So-called loyalty programs offer rewards to repeat customers in exchange for being able to keep track of consumer preferences and buying habits.

A similar concept is fan loyalty, an allegiance to and abiding interest in a sports team, fictional character, or fictional series. Devoted sports fans continue to remain fans even in the face of a string of losing seasons.

==In animals==
Animals as pets may display a sense of loyalty to humans. Famous cases include Greyfriars Bobby, a Skye terrier who attended his master&#x27;s grave for fourteen years; Hachikō, an Akita dog who returned to the place he used to meet his master every day for nine years after his death; and Foxie, the spaniel belonging to Charles Gough, who stayed by her dead master&#x27;s side for three months on Helvellyn in the Lake District in 1805 (although it is possible that Foxie had eaten Gough&#x27;s body).

In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the righteous King Yudhishthira appears at the gates of Heaven at the end of his life with a stray dog he had picked up along the way as a companion, having previously lost his brothers and his wife to death. The god Indra is prepared to admit him to Heaven, but refuses to admit the dog, so Yudhishthira refuses to abandon the dog, and prepares to turn away from the gates of Heaven. Then the dog is revealed to be the manifestation of Dharma, the god of righteousness and justice, and who turned out to be his deified self. Yudhishthira enters heaven in the company of his dog, the god of righteousness. Yudhishthira is known by the epithet Dharmaputra, the lord of righteous duty.
==Misplaced==
Misplaced or mistaken loyalty refers to loyalty placed in other persons or organisations where that loyalty is not acknowledged or respected, is betrayed, or taken advantage of. It can also mean loyalty to a malignant or misguided cause.

Social psychology provides a partial explanation for the phenomenon in the way &quot;the &quot;norm of social commitment&quot; directs us to honor our agreements... People usually stick to the deal even though it has changed for the worse&quot;. Humanists point out that &quot;man inherits the capacity for loyalty, but not the use to which he shall put it... may unselfishly devote himself to what is petty or vile, as he may to what is generous and noble&quot;.

<text>Community theatre refers to any theatrical performance made in relation to particular communities—its usage includes theatre made by, with, and for a community. It may refer to a production that is made entirely by a community with no outside help, or a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or a performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community.

Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time staff. Community theatre is often devised and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as carnival, circus, and parades, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. This type of theatre is ever-changing and evolving due to the influences of the community; the artistic process can often be heavily affected by the community&#x27;s socioeconomic circumstances.

There is a certain obligation that community theatre is held to because of the personal and physical connection to its own community and the people within that community. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the social capital of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience members. It is used as a tool for social development, promoting ideas like gender equality, human rights, environment, and democracy. Participants might identify issues and discuss possible solutions. Such plays are rarely performed in traditional s but rather staged in public places, traditional meeting spaces, schools, prisons, or other institutions, inviting an often spontaneous audience to watch. 

== Latin America ==
Partly inspired by Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s interpretation of culture, the seminal theatre practitioner Augusto Boal developed a series of techniques known as the Theatre of the Oppressed from his work developing community theatre in Latin America.

== United Kingdom ==
In Britain the term &quot;community theatre&quot; is sometimes used to distinguish theatre made by professional theatre artists with or for particular communities from that made entirely by non-professionals, which is usually known as &quot;amateur theatre&quot; or &quot;amateur dramatics.&quot; Notable practitioners include Joan Littlewood and her Theatre Workshop, John McGrath and Elizabeth MacLennan and their 7:84 company, Welfare State International, and Ann Jellicoe founder of the Colway Theatre Trust, now known as the Claque Theatre and run by UK practitioner Jon Oram.

The term can also refer to venues owned by (and run) by volunteers with the main organisation representing these being the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain

== Netherlands ==
Community theatre in the Netherlands came about either from professional radical people&#x27;s theatre companies, or as an outgrowth of the theatre in education movement. The big theatre in the Netherlands which was created originally for theatre in education and subsequently community theatre, is the Stut Theatre. This theatre idea began in 1977 by Jos Bours and Marlies Hautvast, who when they first started creating plays at the Stut Theatre, realized this kind of community theatre had a completely different approach from theatre in education.

== United States ==

Community theatre in the United States was an outgrowth of the Little Theatre Movement, a reform movement which began in 1912 in reaction to massive Victorian melodramatic theatre spectacles. The country&#x27;s oldest extant community theatre venue, Gates Hall in Pultneyville, New York, has existed since the 19th century and presented amateur performances every year since 1867.

The American Association of Community Theatre represents community theatres in the U.S., its territories, and theatre companies with the overseas U.S. military services.

== Canada ==
Canada has an extensive network of amateur theatre groups known as community players, and many belong to provincial associations, as in Ontario, where many companies are members of the Association of Canadian Theatres (ACT-CO).

The alternative theatre movement, which had a nationalist focus when it emerged in Canada in the late 1960s and early 1970s, produced a number of professional companies that focused on local communities and histories. Theatre Passe Muraille sent ensemble casts into rural communities to record local stories, songs, accents, and lifestyle. Their employment of collective creation served as an inspiration and spread across Canada. Passe Muraille facilitated the first production of Codco, which employed personal experiences of Newfoundland culture in their shows.

The 1980s witnessed an unprecedented rise in “Popular Theatre” companies, such as Headlines Theatre (Vancouver), Company of Sirens (Toronto), and the Popular Theatre Alliance of Manitoba (Winnipeg), which utilized political theatre practices such agitprop, guerilla theatre, Brecht’s epic theatre techniques, and Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed to take theatre to the people and create productions by and for specific communities.

Second generation companies, such as Mixed Theatre Company (Toronto), and Stage Left Productions in Canmore, Alberta, continue this practice in the present day. Drawing on Brechtian and Forum Theatre techniques, and “making the invisible visible,” Stage Left has a long history as a grassroots group of “diverse artists and non-artists/catalysts of change who create pathways to systemic equity – in and through the arts,” and their activities “promote equity &amp; diversity, provide support services for still-excluded artists and community groups, and produce radical forms of Political Art.&quot;

== Australia and New Zealand ==
In Western Australia, there are a substantial number of community theatre groups who have banded together to form the Independent Theatre Association.

The South Canterbury Drama League is a community theatre based in Timaru, New Zealand.

== Churches ==
Ecclesiastical communities often encourage theatrical productions, be they for youth or adults. The Christmas Play is a tenet of modern church theatre. In addition to performing in the church itself, many parishes have halls for performances. In the nineteenth century, Christians in European and North American often performed plays in church halls or other rented spaces, often using the proceeds from donations and tickets for charity.

== Communism ==
Soviet initiatives like the Petrograd Politprosvet and Central Agitational Studio performed improvisational theatre in the 1920s as a pedagogical project to tell stories about Marxist values and anticapitalist enlightenment. In 1923, the Twelfth Communist Party Congress voted to support their work for the improvement of proletarian life. The performers rejected traditional forms of theatre and called themselves activists instead.

<doc id="189048" wikidata="Q168015" url="?curid=189048" title="Klaus Schulze">
<text>Klaus Schulze (4 August 1947 – 26 April 2022) was a German electronic music pioneer, composer and musician. He also used the alias Richard Wahnfried and was a member of the Krautrock bands Tangerine Dream, Ash Ra Tempel, and the Cosmic Jokers before launching a solo career consisting of more than 60 albums released across six decades.

== Early life ==
Schulze was born in Berlin in 1947. His father was a writer, and his mother a ballet dancer. After graduating from high school, he delivered telegrams and studied German at Technische Universität Berlin. He and his wife Elfie had two sons Maximilian and Richard.

==Career==
===1970s===
In 1969, Schulze was the drummer of one of the early incarnations of Tangerine Dream – one of the most famous bands that got the nickname &quot;Krautrock&quot; in English speaking countries (others included Kraftwerk and Popol Vuh) – for their debut album &quot;Electronic Meditation&quot;. Before 1969 he was a drummer in a band called Psy Free. He met Edgar Froese from Tangerine Dream in the Zodiac Club in what was then West Berlin. In 1970 he left this group to form Ash Ra Tempel with Manuel Göttsching and Hartmut Enke. In 1971, he chose again to leave a newly formed group after only one album, this time to mount a solo career. In 1972, Schulze released his debut album &quot;Irrlicht&quot; with organ and a recording of an orchestra filtered almost beyond recognition. Despite the lack of synthesizers, this proto-ambient work is regarded as a milestone in electronic music. His follow-up album, &quot;Cyborg&quot;, was similar but added the EMS VCS 3 synthesizer.

Since this point, Schulze&#x27;s career was the most prolific, such that he could claim more than 40 original albums to his name since &quot;Irrlicht&quot;. Highlights of these include 1975&#x27;s &quot;Timewind&quot;, 1976&#x27;s &quot;Moondawn&quot; (his first album to feature the Moog synthesizer), 1979&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, and 1995&#x27;s double-album &quot;In Blue&quot; (which featured one long track called &quot;Return to the Tempel&quot; with electric guitar contributions from his friend Manuel Göttsching of Ash Ra Tempel). In 1976, he was drafted by Japanese percussionist and composer Stomu Yamashta to join his short-lived &quot;supergroup&quot; Go, also featuring Steve Winwood, Michael Shrieve, and Al Di Meola. They released two studio albums (&quot;Go&quot; in 1976 and &quot;Go Too&quot; in 1977) and one live album (&quot;Go Live from Paris&quot;, 1976).

Throughout the 1970s he followed closely in the footsteps of Tangerine Dream, albeit with far lighter sequencer lines and a more reflective, dreamy sheen, not unlike the ambient music of his contemporary Brian Eno. On occasions he would also compose film scores, including horror and thriller movies such as &quot;Barracuda&quot; (1977) and &quot;Next of Kin&quot; (1982). Some of his lighter albums are appreciated by new-age music fans, despite the fact that Schulze has always denied connections to this genre. By mid-decade, with the release of &quot;Timewind&quot; and &quot;Moondawn&quot;, his style transformed from Krautrock to Berlin School.

Schulze had a more organic sound than other electronic artists of the time. Often he would throw in decidedly non-electronic sounds, such as acoustic guitar and a male operatic voice in &quot;Blackdance&quot;, or a cello in &quot;Dune&quot; (1979) and &quot;Trancefer&quot;. Schulze developed a Minimoog patch that sounds uncannily like an electric guitar. Schulze often takes German events as a starting point for his compositions, a notable example being on his 1978 album &quot;&quot;X&quot;&quot; (the title signifying it was his tenth album), subtitled &quot;Six Musical Biographies&quot;, a reference to such notables as Ludwig II of Bavaria, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georg Trakl, and Wilhelm Friedemann Bach. His use of the pseudonym &quot;Richard Wahnfried&quot; is indicative of his interest in Richard Wagner, a clear influence on some albums like the aforementioned &quot;Timewind&quot;.

Schulze built a record studio in Hambühren, Germany.

===1980s===
In the 1980s Schulze started using digital instruments besides the usual analog synthesizers, and his work accordingly became less experimental and more accessible. Although the switch to using digital equipment is audible in the style of &quot;Dig It&quot; (1980), it was not until the release of &quot;Trancefer&quot; (1981) that the shift in style became evident.

This newer style can also be found in Schulze&#x27;s next release &quot;Audentity&quot;. Both &quot;Cellistica&quot; and &quot;Spielglocken&quot; are composed in a similar sequencer-based style as on &quot;Trancefer&quot;, but this is certainly not the case of all of &quot;Audentity&quot;″s tracks; indeed, &quot;Sebastian im Traum&quot; hints towards the operatic style to be found in some of Schulze&#x27;s much later works. The predominance of sequencing can also be found in the follow-up live album &quot;Dziękuję Poland Live &#x27;83&quot;, although many of its tracks are re-workings of those to be found on &quot;Audentity&quot;. Schulze&#x27;s next studio-based album was &quot;Angst&quot; (soundtrack to the namesake 1983 film). The cold yet haunting electronic rhythms generate an alienated atmosphere. Typical are the Fairlight synth and Linn electronic drums sounds.

Another highlight of this era was &quot;En=Trance&quot; with the dreamy cut &quot;FM Delight&quot;. The album &quot;Miditerranean Pads&quot; marked the beginning of very complex percussion arrangements that continued through the next two decades.

In 1989, German band Alphaville released their album &quot;The Breathtaking Blue&quot;, on which Klaus Schulze was both a contributing musician and the album&#x27;s producer.

===1990s===
Starting with &quot;Beyond Recall&quot;, the first half of the 1990s was his &quot;sample&quot; period, when Schulze used a wide variety of prerecorded sounds such as screeching birds and sensuous female moans in his studio albums and live performances. Sampling heavily died down with his 1995 album &quot;In Blue&quot;. The decade also saw the release of copious amounts of previously unreleased material, of varying quality, in several limited-edition boxed sets.

===2000s===

In 2005 he began re-releasing his classic solo and Wahnfried albums with bonus tracks of unreleased material recorded at roughly the same time as the original works. In the latter part of the decade, Schulze produced albums and staged numerous live appearances with Lisa Gerrard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klaus Schulze feat. Lisa Gerrard: Rheingold (Review/Kritik) 2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
&quot;Big in Japan: Live in Tokyo 2010&quot; was Schulze&#x27;s fortieth album, and its release in September 2010 marked the beginning of his fifth decade as a solo musician. The Japan concerts were to be his last live performances. 

His next album, &quot;Shadowlands&quot;, was released in February 2013, quickly to be followed by the release of &quot;The Schulze–Schickert Session 1975&quot;, a rare long-unreleased collaboration, in March 2013. After a hiatus of several years, he returned to the studio in 2018 for another album, &quot;Silhouettes&quot;. Much of the album was recorded in a single take.

===2020s===
Schulze died on 26 April 2022 following a long illness. His final album, &quot;Deus Arrakis&quot;, was released on 1 July 2022.

==Richard Wahnfried==
&quot;Richard Wahnfried&quot;, then simply &quot;Wahnfried&quot; after 1993, is the longtime and only real alias for Klaus Schulze – originally a pseudonym, later an official side project name. Seven albums were released under this name between 1979 and 1997.

The main characteristics of the Wahnfried albums (as opposed to Schulze&#x27;s regular works) are:

* Often being oriented towards more mainstream genres (some would say &quot;more commercial&quot;), such as rock, dance, techno, and trance.
* Always allowing for collaborative and less electronic albums, with known or unknown guest musicians performing along with Schulze&#x27;s synths.

The pseudonym&#x27;s etymology stems from Schulze&#x27;s love for Richard Wagner:
* Richard, evidently from Wagner&#x27;s first name. Richard is also the name of Schulze&#x27;s first son.
* Wahnfried (&quot;Peace from delusion and/or madness&quot;, in German), from the name Wagner gave to his villa in Bayreuth (and where he was later buried).

In his 1975 album &quot;Timewind&quot; (four years before the first alias use), Schulze had already named a track &quot;Wahnfried 1883&quot; (in reference to Wagner&#x27;s death and burial in his Wahnfried&#x27;s garden in 1883). The other track on &quot;Timewind&quot; is called &quot;Bayreuth Return&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klaus Schulze: Timewind (1974) (Review/Kritik) 2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After 1993, the albums are simply credited to &quot;Wahnfried&quot;, and namedrop Schulze (&quot;featuring Klaus Schulze&quot;, &quot;Produced by Klaus Schulze&quot;).

&quot;Wahnfried&quot; is the only known alias of Schulze (albeit on the 1998 &quot;Tribute to Klaus Schulze&quot; album, among 10 other artists, Schulze contributed one track barely hidden behind the &quot;Schulzendorfer Groove Orchester&quot; pseudonym).

==Discography==
=== Albums ===
Schulze&#x27;s concert performances are original compositions recorded live and thus listed as albums. An intensive reissue program of Schulze CDs began in 2005, with most releases having bonus tracks, and sometimes additional discs. They are published by the label &quot;Revisited Records&quot; (a division of German company InsideOut Music), and distributed by SPV.

<text>Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport in which gymnasts perform individually or in groups on a floor with an apparatus: hoop, ball, clubs, ribbon and rope. The sport combines elements of gymnastics, dance and calisthenics; gymnasts must be strong, flexible, agile, dexterous and coordinated. Rhythmic gymnastics is governed by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), which first recognized it as a sport in 1963. At the international level, rhythmic gymnastics is a women-only sport.

Rhythmic gymnastics became an Olympic sport in 1984, when the individual all-around event was first competed, and the group competition was also added to the Olympics in 1996. The most prestigious competitions, besides the Olympic Games, are the World Championships, World Games, European Championships, European Games, the World Cup Series and the Grand Prix Series. Gymnasts are judged on their artistry, execution of skills, and difficulty of skills, for which they gain points. They perform leaps, balances, and rotations (spins) along with handling the apparatus.

==History==

Rhythmic gymnastics grew out of the ideas of Jean-Georges Noverre (1727–1810), François Delsarte (1811–1871), and Rudolf Bode (1881–1970), who all believed in movement expression, where one used to dance to express oneself and exercise various body parts. Peter Henry Ling further developed this idea in his 19th-century Swedish system of free exercise, which promoted &quot;aesthetic gymnastics&quot;, in which students expressed their feelings and emotions through body movement.

Swedish-style group gymnastics became increasingly popular for women from the mid-19th century through to the early 20th century. Although sports became associated with masculinity, group gymnastics were performed in indoor, private spaces and focused on correctly performing movements before an instructor, which fit societal ideals for women. Women&#x27;s gymnastics also began to focus on qualities perceived as feminine, such as grace and expressiveness.

Ling&#x27;s ideas were extended by Catharine Beecher, who founded the Western Female Institute in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, in 1837. She developed a program where pupils exercised to music, moving from simple calisthenics that could be done in a classroom to more strenuous activities. While she promoted the exercises as being for all children, she emphasized that girls were especially lacking in exercise and that their health suffered for it.

François Delsarte created a system of movement which was focused on creating expressive acting with natural poses, but it became a popular form of women&#x27;s gymnastics for developing grace. In 1885, an American student of Delsarte, Genevieve Stebbins, published her first book, &quot;The Delsarte System of Expression&quot;. She went on to combine his ideas with Ling&#x27;s and developed her own gymnastics system. Dubbed &quot;harmonic gymnastics&quot;, it enabled late nineteenth-century American women to engage in physical culture and expression, especially in dance. Stebbins provided the means, rationale, and model for what could be accepted as the appropriate practices for middle and upper-class women.

During the 1880s, Émile Jaques-Dalcroze of Switzerland developed eurhythmics, a form of physical training for musicians and dancers. Robert Bode trained at the Dalcroze Eurythmic College and went on to found his own school. George Demeny of France created exercises to music that were designed to promote grace of movement, muscular flexibility, and good posture, and some exercises included apparatuses. 

These styles were combined around 1900 into the Swedish school of rhythmic gymnastics, which would later add dance elements from Finland. Several Swedish gymnastics teachers felt the Ling approach was too rigid and dull and sought freer styles of movements, and many Scandinavian gymnastics groups toured abroad. In 1929, Hinrich Medau, who graduated from the Bode School, founded The Medau School in Berlin to train gymnasts in &quot;modern gymnastics&quot;. He focused on using the entire body in movement and developed the use of apparatuses, particularly balls, hoops, and clubs.

The dancer Isadora Duncan was also significant in the development of rhythmic gymnastics. Influenced by Delsarte and Jaques-Dalcroze, she developed her own theory of dance that departed from more rigid traditions like that of ballet. Her free dancing style incorporated running and jumping movements.

The teachings of Duncan, Jacques-Dalcroze, Delsarte, and Demeny were brought together at the Soviet Union&#x27;s High School of Artistic Movement when it was founded in 1932, and soon thereafter, an early version of rhythmic gymnastics was established as a sport for girls. The first competition was held in 1939 in Leningrad on International Women&#x27;s Day. Beginning in 1947, All-Soviet Union competitions were held yearly in various locations across the Soviet Union, and the sport began to spread to other countries in Europe.

From 1928 through 1956, group events with apparatuses were sometimes performed as events in women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, such as club performances at the World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. There were two team portable apparatus events at the 1952 and 1956 Olympics, which used similar apparatuses to modern rhythmic gymnastics, before it was decided that it should be a separate discipline.

The FIG formally recognized rhythmic gymnastics as its own discipline in 1962, first as modern gymnastics. Its name was changed to modern rhythmic gymnastics, then again to rhythmic sportive gymnastics, and finally to rhythmic gymnastics.

The first World Championships for individual rhythmic gymnasts was held in 1963 in Budapest. Groups were introduced at the same level in 1967 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The FIG first requested that rhythmic gymnastics be added to the Olympics in 1972. It was painted as a more feminine counterpart to women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, where increasingly difficult tumbling led to a perceived masculinization of the sport. However, the International Olympic Committee initially refused the request.

Rhythmic gymnastics debuted as an Olympic sport at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles with the individual all-around competition. However, many federations from the Eastern Bloc and countries were forced to boycott by the Soviet Union, in a way similar to the boycott forced on many nations by the United States of the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics. Canadian Lori Fung was the first rhythmic gymnast to earn an Olympic gold medal. The group competition was added to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The Spanish group won the first gold medal of the new competition with a group formed by Estela Giménez, Marta Baldó, Nuria Cabanillas, Lorena Guréndez, Estíbaliz Martínez and Tania Lamarca.

==The gymnast==

International competitive rhythmic gymnastics is restricted to female participants. However, men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics has a history in Japan as its own sport that was originally performed by both men and women. In France, men are allowed to participate in lower-level national competitions, while in Spain, there is a national rhythmic gymnastics championships for men and mixed-sex group competitions. A men&#x27;s program has yet to be formally recognized by the FIG.

Gymnasts start at a young age; it is considered an early specialization sport. They become age-eligible to compete in the Olympic Games and other major senior international competitions on January 1 of their 16th year (for example, a gymnast born on 31 December 2024 would be age-eligible for the 2024 Olympics). Rhythmic gymnasts have historically tended to peak at a slightly later age than artistic gymnasts. In the late 90s and early 2000s, Olympic rhythmic gymnasts were on average a year older than Olympic artistic gymnasts, and gymnasts increasingly began to compete through their 20s. The median age of gymnasts competing at the 2021 continental championships was in the late teens, with the African Championships and Oceania Championships skewing slightly younger, while the median ages of event finalists at the European Championships and Pan American Championships were in the early 20s.

Top rhythmic gymnasts must have good balance, flexibility, coordination, and strength, and they must possess psychological attributes such as the ability to compete under intense pressure and the discipline and work ethic to practice the same skills over and over again.

Currently a gymnast can perform in the individual event or in the group event. Since 1995, groups consist of five gymnasts. Originally six gymnasts composed a group, although around the 1980s eight gymnasts were permitted.

==Apparatus==

The hoop, rope, and ball were the first official apparatuses, with the ribbon being added in 1971 and the clubs in 1973. Historically, four out of the five possible apparatuses were selected by the FIG to be used by individual gymnasts each season. Each exercise takes place on a x floor. The floor is carpeted but has no springs, unlike the one used for floor exercise in artistic gymnastics. Replacement apparatuses are placed on two sides of the floor and can be taken to continue the exercise if the gymnast&#x27;s apparatus becomes unusable or is lost outside the floor area.

After 2011, rope began to be transitioned out of the sport, with the FIG saying that it was less visually appealing than the other apparatus. It was removed from the senior individual program, and the most recent usage of rope in the senior program was for the mixed apparatus group exercise in 2017. The FIG also planned to drop rope in junior-level individual competition, but it returned in 2015; it was then announced that rope would be used in junior individual competition in some years through at least the 2023–2024 season, but the 2022–2024 Code of Points dropped it again. It continues to be used for junior groups.

Routines performed without any apparatus are known as freehand. Freehand was an event for the four first World Championships before being dropped, with the reasoning being that the freehand exercises tended to be too theatrical and include too many ballet elements. It is now only used in local competitions, usually for the youngest levels.
Since 2011, senior individual gymnasts perform four different routines with hoop, ball, clubs and ribbon. This is the case for individual juniors as well since 2020. Senior groups perform two different routines, one with a single apparatus and one with mixed apparatus (for example, a routine with 5 hoops and a routine with 3 balls / 2 ribbons). Junior groups perform two different routines with two different types of apparatus (for example, a routine with 5 hoops and a routine with 5 ribbons). As of 2017, rhythmic gymnastics equipment used in FIG-sanctioned events must have the FIG logo on the apparatus.

;Rope: The rope is made from hemp or a similar synthetic material; it can be knotted and have anti-slip material at the ends, but it does not have handles. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaping and skipping. In 2011, the FIG decided to eliminate the use of rope in senior individual rhythmic gymnastics competitions. It is still sometimes seen in junior group competition.

; Hoop:The hoop comes up to about the gymnast&#x27;s hip. It may be made of plastic or wood, and it may be covered with adhesive tape either of the same or different color as the hoop, which may be in decorative patterns. Fundamental requirements of a hoop routine include rotation of the hoop around the hand or body, rolling the hoop on the body or floor, and the gymnast passing through the hoop.
; Ball: The ball may be made of rubber or a similar synthetic material, and it can be of any color. It should rest in the gymnast&#x27;s hand and not be pressed against the wrist or grasped with the fingers, which incurs a penalty. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include bouncing or rolling the ball.

; Clubs: The clubs may be made of wood or synthetic materials, and they are always used in a pair. They may be connected together by inserting the end of one club into the head of the other. The handles and bodies are typically wrapped with decorative tapes. Fundamental elements of a clubs routine including swinging the heads of the clubs in circles, small throws in which the clubs rotate in the air, and asymmetrical movements.

; Ribbon:The ribbon consists of a handle, which may be made of wood, bamboo, or synthetic materials such as fiberglass, and the ribbon itself, which is made of satin. The ribbon is six meters long, and due to its length, it can easily become tangled or knotted; knots must be undone or the gymnast will be penalized. Fundamental elements of a ribbon routine consist of making continuous shapes with the length of the fabric, such as tight circles (spirals) or waves (snakes), and elements called boomerangs, in which the gymnast tosses the handle, then pulls it back by the end of the ribbon and catches it.

== Elements ==
Elements in rhythmic gymnastics have assigned difficulty values that contribute to the overall difficulty score. They are generally divided into two types: body and apparatus difficulties. New difficulties may be submitted to the technical committee by coaches.

=== Body difficulties ===
Body difficulties are elements performed using the body, with each one having a defined shape. The apparatus must continue to be used during a body difficulty, and gymnasts must perform at least one of each type and generally should not repeat the exact same element during one exercise. The types of body difficulties are:
* Jumps/Leaps: Jumps must be high enough to show a well-defined shape in the air. The same leap may be repeated in a series.
* Balances: A balance must be held for at least one second. They can be performed alone or in a dynamic balance, in which the gymnast performs at least three balances in combination on the same foot with a turn between each balance.
* Rotations: Rotations are turns generally performed either on a flat foot or on relevé, but they can also be performed on other parts of the body.
* For groups: Exchanges, which are an element where all five gymnasts perform a high, long throw of their apparatus to another gymnast and then catch an apparatus thrown by another gymnast. This can be done simultaneously by the whole group, or one sub-group may perform an exchange before the rest of the gymnasts do so.
In addition, gymnasts may perform full body waves, which are a wave of movement through the whole body from the head through the feet or vice versa. Individuals may also perform up to four dynamic elements with rotation, which are commonly known as risks. During a risk, the gymnast throws the apparatus high into the air and rotates at least twice underneath it, using either a series of turning leaps or a combination of rolls, turns on the feet, or pre-acrobatic elements such as cartwheels or walkovers, before catching the apparatus. Groups may elect to perform a single risk.

=== Apparatus difficulties ===
Apparatus difficulties are elements performed with the apparatus. Each apparatus difficulty has either one base element and two or more criteria executed during that base, or the base element of a catch from a high throw combined with a second base element and one or more criteria executed during both bases. A base is a basic movement or usage of the apparatus, such as a large roll of the hoop, and a criterion is a way of performing a movement which makes it more difficult, such as performing it outside of the visual field or without using the hands. The base elements differ somewhat by apparatus, with some bases (such as a high throw) being valid for all apparatuses and others being particular to one apparatus (such as creating a spiral pattern with the ribbon fabric).

For groups, apparatus difficulties include collaborations between all five gymnasts, in which each gymnast works with one or more apparatuses and one or more partners. These can include multiple apparatuses being thrown at once or gymnasts lifting another gymnast.

=== Dance steps ===
Another required element is the dance steps combination, which must last for at least eight seconds, have a defined character that matches the music, and be performed without high throws of the apparatus, any apparatus difficulties, or pre-acrobatic elements. Two sets of dance steps are required for each exercise. Unlike the body and apparatus difficulties, they are evaluated as part of the artistry score rather than the difficulty score.

==Scoring system and competition format==
In rhythmic gymnastics, competitive exercises are evaluated by the scoring system defined in the FIG Code of Points. After each Olympic games, the code is modified.

=== Competition format ===
Generally, rhythmic gymnastic meets are generally divided into qualifying rounds and event finals. At some competitions, there is also an all-around final for individuals. The Olympics has qualifying rounds and all-around finals for both individuals and groups, but there are no event finals.

In the qualifying round, individual gymnasts compete up to four routines, one for each apparatus; at some competitions, gymnasts may elect to compete only three routines and still qualify for the individual all-around final. Group gymnasts compete two routines, one in which there are five of the same apparatus (such as five balls) and one in which there are two of one apparatus and three of another (such as two hoops and three ribbons). These apparatuses are determined by the FIG for each season. In the all-around, individual gymnasts alternate between competing hoop and ball and then clubs and ribbon, while the groups all perform either their single-apparatus or mixed-apparatus routines during the same competition group.

The qualifying round determines who advances to the event final for each apparatus for individuals and for either apparatus combination for groups. There is a maximum of two qualifiers per country for each individual event final. For groups, their total score in the qualifying round determines their all-around placement. This is also the case for individuals at some competitions, while at others, there is a separate all-around final round where the top qualifying gymnasts (maximum two per country) compete four routines. The all-around score is the sum of the scores of all routines performed in that round of competition.

At some competitions, there is also a team ranking for federations with at least two individuals and a group entered. The team score is the sum of the eight qualifying round scores (two per apparatus) earned by the individual gymnasts and the qualifying round all-around score earned by the group.

===Code of Points===
In the current Code of Points (2025–2028), the final score of a routine is the sum of the difficulty, execution, and artistry scores, minus any additional penalties incurred. The difficulty score is open-ended with no maximum, while the execution and artistry scores have a starting value of 10 points and are lowered for specific mistakes made by the gymnasts.

==== Difficulty ====
The difficulty score is the sum of the value of the difficulty assigned to each element in the gymnast&#x27;s routine. The score is evaluated during the routine without a predetermined difficulty sheet, unlike with some earlier Codes. It is made up of two component scores: one for body difficulties and one for apparatus difficulties.

==== Execution ====
Execution is the degree to which the gymnast performs an element with aesthetic and technical perfection. Execution penalties are subtracted from the starting score of 10 and range in size from 0.10 points for a small fault, such as poor amplitude in a body wave or a small deviation from the desired shape of a leap, to 1.00 points, such as for dropping or losing the apparatus outside the floor area. Execution deductions include poor body form during an element, poor technique using an apparatus like squeezing the ball, loss of balance, not holding a balance element for long enough, hopping during a rotation element, needing to take steps to catch a thrown apparatus, or losing or dropping the apparatus.

==== Artistry ====
Artistry evaluates the artistic performance of the gymnast and the composition of the exercise with the music. As with execution, penalties are defined by the code and subtracted from the starting score of 10. The ideal is for the gymnast to perform with continuous character using a variety of movements that reflect changes in the music and are connected smoothly together. Deductions range from 0.30 to 1.00 for penalties that are taken once, which include deductions for a lack of dynamic change or use of effect in the exercise, a lack of facial expression, not ending in time with the music, missing a complete dance step combination, or not using the entire floor area. Deductions for poor connections between elements and poor connection to the music (such as a musical accent not being emphasized by the gymnast&#x27;s movements) are 0.10 points each and can be taken up to 20 times in one exercise.

==== Penalties ====
Finally, penalties are taken by the time, line, and responsible judges. Possible penalties include:

* The gymnast leaving the floor area
* The apparatus leaving the floor area
* The exercise being longer or shorter than the acceptable length of time (1&#x27;15&quot; to 1&#x27;30&quot; is the required length for individual routines, and 2&#x27;15&quot; to 2&#x27;30&quot; is the required length for group routines)
* Dress of the gymnast not conforming to the regulations
* Communication with the coach during the execution of the exercise
* Verbal communication between group gymnasts during the exercise
* Grabbing a new apparatus from the side of the floor if the first apparatus is still on the floor area.

===Evolution of the Code of Points===
Rhythmic gymnastics has been through a number of different Codes of Points beginning with the publication of the first in 1970. The first two codes were valid from 1970 to 1971 and 1971–1972; beginning with the 1973–1976 Code, the Code of Points is adjusted after each Olympics, although smaller changes are also made during each Olympic cycle. As with artistic gymnastics, scores originally had a maximum of 10.

The first few years of rhythmic gymnastics competition did not yet have a code of points. A commission was formed to write the rules of the new sport in 1968, and they released the first code in 1970. In the decades of the 60s and 70s, scoring emphasized the artistic side, with little emphasis on difficulty.

In the 1973–1976 code, for individuals, difficulty accounted for five points of the score. Elements were divided into &#x27;medium&#x27; and &#x27;superior&#x27; difficulty, and gymnasts were required to include two superior difficulty and six medium difficulty elements, at least three of which had to be performed with the left hand. For example, a body wave on two feet or a single split leap was of medium difficulty, while a body wave on one foot or a series of two leaps in a row was of superior difficulty. The remaining five points were made up of originality, relation to the music, execution, and general impression. For groups, scores were out of a maximum of 20, with five points each given for the composition, technical value, execution, and general harmony.

In the 1980s, new difficulty elements were introduced to give greater prominence to flexibility and risk releases, and to encourage originality. In the early 1980s, the scoring remained similar, though technical value of the routine was added as part of the marking for the individual score. In 1985, the score was composed of Composition (Technical + Artistry) and Execution, each of which was scored out of 5 points. Risk elements were introduced in the 1989–1992 code, and the required difficulties were changed to four superior and four medium. The 1993–1996 code increased the required number of body difficulties to 12 and divided them into four categories of difficulty rather than two.

In 1997, the Code of Points was significantly changed by dividing the score into Artistry (out of 5 points for individual or 6 points for groups), Technical (out of 5 points for individuals or 4 points for groups) and Execution (out of 10 points), with the perfect score being 10 points for individuals and 20 points for groups.

In the late 90s, there was an appearance of gymnasts whose routines included demonstrating extreme flexibility (Yana Batyrchina or Alina Kabaeva for example). In the 1997–2001 code, the allowed body difficulties increased to twelve, and the number of flexibility-related difficulties in the code more than doubled from 11 to 24. The 2001–2005 code focused on extreme flexibility at the expense of apparatus handling and artistry. Scores had a maximum of thirty points, divided into three categories with a maximum of ten points each: execution, artistic, and difficulty. In 2005–2008 code, the number of body difficulties increased again to 18, and they were more finely graded in difficulty rating. The score still included the same three categories, but it was now out of 20 points, as artistry and difficulty were averaged and then added to execution.

In 2009, the code changed significantly due to the perception that artistry had been lost with the focus on difficulty. As under the 2001–2005 code, the final mark was obtained by adding difficulty (body difficulties, again reduced to twelve, masteries performed with the apparatus, and risk elements), artistry and execution; each had a maximum value of 10 points, so the final score would be a maximum of 30 points. The artistry score was given its own evaluation form and guidelines with specific deductions.

In 2013, the code dropped the artistic score again, and artistry was instead evaluated as part of execution. The maximum number of body difficulties was reduced once more to nine, and the dance steps combination was introduced as its own element. The 2017 code was very similar, with difficulty strictly limited and differences among the best gymnasts heavily determined by the execution. Therefore, in 2018, the difficulty score became open-ended for the first time.

In the 2022–2024 code, the artistry score was once again re-introduced. The 2025–2028 code reduced the maximum number of difficulties counted in the exercise to give more room for artistic expression and transitions between elements. Some body difficulties were removed and others merged to encourage variety and discourage injuries.

=== Judging issues ===
Judging rhythmic gymnastics in real time is a difficult task. In addition, judges may be affected by fatigue at long competitions or by high temperatures in competition rounds where ribbon routines are being performed; air conditioning is typically turned off during those rounds because it can cause drafts that interfere with the ribbon&#x27;s movement. At the 2023 World Championships, held in Valencia, Spain, the arena reached .

Group judging is especially difficult, as five gymnasts and five apparatuses are in constant, complex motion over a large area. A 2015 study comparing novice, national-level, and international-level judges when judging two group routines found that although the international-level judges performed the best at correctly identifying errors, they only recorded about 40% of errors when they evaluated a routine using normal judging procedures. They made more mistakes when judging the mixed apparatus routine compared to the single-apparatus routine.

As in other judged sports, national bias is also an issue. A study performed in 2023 using the FIG&#x27;s judging evaluation statistics found that there was significant national bias in aerobic, artistic, and rhythmic gymnastics judging. The FIG uses the judging evaluation statistics to provide feedback to judges and guide judging assignments and changes in judging procedures. Judges can be sanctioned if they are found to be giving biased scores; for example, after the scoring at the 2015 World Championships was reviewed, one judge was suspended and another was given a warning, both for national bias.

== Attire and music ==

=== Attire ===
Gymnasts wear leotards to compete, which may be decorated to match the routine as long as they do not have excessive amounts of flesh-colored fabric; group gymnasts must wear identical leotards. Modern leotards are typically highly decorated and may contain hand-painted details and large numbers of crystals, which can make them very expensive, and gymnasts at high levels typically wear different leotards to compete with different apparatuses. Gymnasts may choose to wear long tights under their leotard, wear a leotard with long legs (a unitard) as long as the legs are the same length and color, or wear a short skirt (no longer than the pelvis) over or attached to their leotard or unitard. They may not wear other accessories such as gloves that are not attached to the leotard, except for optionally wearing rhythmic toe shoes.

Rhythmic gymnasts wear special slippers that cover their toes but not heels to reduce friction for rotations. Depending on the surface a gymnast is practicing on, they may be worn through in a week or two.

Leotards were originally simple, with decorations such as flowers or sequins not allowed. Tights could be worn starting in 1993. Unitards were also introduced as an option. Beginning in 1997, requirements loosened, and gymnasts were allowed to decorate their leotards with geometric and flower designs, sequins, and metallic colors. Unitards were popular through the late 90s but became less common afterward.

Skirted leotards were introduced in the 2001–2004 code of points. Former gymnast Michelle Smith suggested that they might help older athletes feel more confident at a time when it was becoming more common for gymnasts to continue competing into their 20s.

=== Music ===
Gymnasts may use music from any style, and the routine should be choreographed to the specific music chosen. The code of points says that music should be selected with respect to personal qualities of the gymnast, such as age. A penalty may be applied for musical choices that violate the ethical norms of rhythmic gymnastics, and sounds not typically used in music, such as sirens, are forbidden. Individual routines range from one minute and fifteen seconds to one minute and thirty seconds, while group routines may be from two minutes and fifteen seconds to two minutes and thirty seconds.

Gymnasts originally performed to music using a single instrument, which could be either live accompaniment (typically a piano) or taped music. Under the 1989–1992 code, groups were allowed to use music played on multiple instruments. This change came into effect for individual routines as well in the 1993–1996 code, which also emphasized that gymnasts should interpret and move with the music and that it should not be background noise to the routine. Beginning in 2013, gymnasts could use music with lyrics, but only for one routine. Under the 2017–2021 code of points, individuals could use lyrics with music for two routines. The restriction on music with lyrics was dropped from the 2022–2024 code of points.

==Major competitions==
According to the technical regulations defined by the International Gymnastics Federation, the only official competitions in which rhythmic gymnastics events are contested globally are: the World Championships; the stages of the World Cup series (including the defunct World Cup Final); the World Games; and the Olympic Games (as well as the Youth Olympic Games). Test events for the Olympic Games were held in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016, and these were also officially organized by the FIG. Since 2019, the Junior World Championships are held every two years.

The nations which have earned at least one medal in official FIG competitions are:
*

Major rhythmic gymnastics tournaments not officially organized by FIG include the continental championships (the European Championships and its junior division, the Pan American Championships, the Asian Championships, the African Championships, and the Oceania Championships), the Grand Prix series, and multi-sport events in which rhythmic gymnastics is part of the program, such as the European Games, the Pan American Games, the Asian Games, and the Summer World University Games.

Major defunct championships or competitions in which rhythmic gymnastics events were held include the European Cup Final, the European Team Gymnastics Championships, the Goodwill Games, and the Four Continents Gymnastics Championships (reserved for senior athletes from the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania).

==Dominant teams and nations==
Rhythmic gymnastics has been dominated by Eastern European countries, especially the Soviet Union (Post-Soviet Republics of today) and Bulgaria. The two countries were in rivalry with each other from the third World Championships, where the ballet foundations of the Soviet athletes were contrasted against the risky throws and catches of the Bulgarian competitors, until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia became the dominant country of rhythmic gymnastics.

=== Soviet Union ===

Before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Soviet rhythmic gymnasts were engaged in a fierce competition with Bulgaria. The first World Championships held in 1963 in Budapest, Hungary was won by Soviet gymnast Ludmila Savinkova, and in 1967 in Copenhagen, Denmark, the first group championship was also won by the USSR.

Other Soviet World all-around champions in individuals included Elena Karpuchina, Galima Shugurova and Irina Deriugina. Marina Lobatch became the first Soviet to win the Olympic Games in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In 1991, The Unified Team was formed and two Soviet/Ukrainian gymnasts competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona; Olexandra Tymoshenko won gold and Oxana Skaldina won bronze.

=== Bulgaria ===

The Bulgarian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation was established in 1963, and in the early days of the sport, most elite gymnasts spent time training in Bulgaria.

Since the inception of rhythmic gymnastics as a World Championship event, Bulgaria was in competition with the Soviet Union; during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Bulgaria won 10 individual World titles with its star gymnasts Maria Gigova (three-time World all-around champion), Neshka Robeva and Kristina Guiourova.

The 1980s marked the height of Bulgarian success with a generation of gymnasts known as the Golden Girls of Bulgaria, with gymnasts Iliana Raeva, Anelia Ralenkova, Lilia Ignatova, Diliana Gueorguieva, Bianka Panova, Adriana Dunavska (the silver medalist at the 1988 Summer Olympics) and Elizabeth Koleva dominating the World Championships. Bianka Panova became the first rhythmic gymnast to make a clean sweep of all five individual events at a World Championship. She also became the first rhythmic gymnast to get into the Guinness Book of World Records by earning full marks in all her routines (total of 8) at a World Championship, and she received the trophy personally from the President of the International Olympic Committee at the time, Juan Antonio Samaranch.

Bulgarian gymnasts continued to have success into the 1990s, with Mila Marinova winning five medals at the 1991 World Championships and the rise of Maria Petrova, who dominated competition in the mid-1990s to become a three-time World all-around champion and three-time European all-around champion. More recent individuals include 2024 European champion Stiliana Nikolova, as well as Boryana Kaleyn, the 2023 European champion and the silver medalist at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

The Bulgarian group won silver at the first Olympics that included a group event, the 1996 Summer Olympics. They also won the bronze medals at the 2004 Summer Olympics and at the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the following 2020 Summer Olympics, the group (comprising Simona Dyankova, Laura Traets, Stefani Kiryakova, Madlen Radukanova, and Erika Zafirova) won its first gold medal.

=== Russia ===

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia has been the dominant country in rhythmic gymnastics. The start of the late 1990s saw the rise of stars like Amina Zaripova, Yanina Batyrchina and Alina Kabaeva. Oksana Kostina became Russia&#x27;s first World champion as an independent country.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Yulia Barsukova became the first Russian to win the Olympic gold medal. Alina Kabaeva, who had won bronze in Sydney, went on to win gold in the 2004 Athens Olympics and was noted for her flexibility. Evgenia Kanaeva became the first individual rhythmic gymnast to win two gold medals in the Olympic Games at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2012 London Olympics and won 17 World Championship medals during her career, including three all-around golds. Margarita Mamun continued the streak of individual gold medalists at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, while the competition favorite, three-time World champion Yana Kudryavtseva, took silver because of a drop in her clubs routine during the finals.

Twin sisters Dina Averina and Arina Averina are two of the best rhythmic gymnasts in Russia&#x27;s history. Dina Averina won multiple World Championship titles, dominating the sport since her senior debut. She secured over 20 gold medals and four all-around titles at the World Championships, making her the most decorated gymnasts in the history of the sport; at the 2020 Summer Olympics, she won the silver medal. Arina Averina also achieved significant success, consistently earning medals in major international competitions, including the World and European Championships.

The Russian group has won five of the eight group exercises held in the Olympics since it was included in the Olympic Games at the 1996 Summer Olympics by winning every title from 2000 to 2016.

=== Ukraine ===

Even as part of the USSR, a number of Soviet gymnasts were trained in Ukraine or were of Ukrainian origin, including the first World champion Ludmila Savinkova as well as Liubov Sereda. Ukraine has won one gold and four bronze medals at the Olympic Games, and Ukrainian gymnasts representing the USSR and Unified Team won an additional gold and two bronze medals. Irina Deriugina won two all-around World titles, but she was even more influential as a coach. The school she and her mother, Albina Deriugina, opened, the Deriugins School, has played an important role in the success of rhythmic gymnastics in the country, training gymnasts like Olympic medalists Olexandra Tymoshenko and Oxana Skaldina.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Ukraine continued its success in rhythmic gymnastics, with Kateryna Serebrianska winning the Olympic gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and Olena Vitrychenko winning bronze. Hanna Rizatdinova won the bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Anna Bessonova is one of the most decorated rhythmic gymnasts of all time and consistently challenged Russian gymnasts for medals during her career; she won two bronze medals at the Olympics (2004 and 2008) and almost 30 medals at the World Championships. She is also one of few gymnasts to have won gold medals at the World championships as both an individual and group member.

=== Belarus ===

Belarus has had success in both individual and group rhythmic gymnastics after the breakup of the Soviet Union. The first Soviet Olympic gold medalist at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, Marina Lobatch, was a Belarusian; she earned all perfect ten scores during her Olympic performances.

Since the late 1990s, Belarus has had continued success in the Olympic Games and has won two silver and two bronze medals in individuals respectively, with Yulia Raskina, Inna Zhukova, Liubov Charkashyna and Alina Harnasko. The Belarusian group has also won two silver medals and a bronze medal in the Olympics.

=== Spain ===

Spain has a long tradition in rhythmic gymnastics. Some notable success in rhythmic gymnastics for Spain include Ana Bautista, who won a gold medal in the rope competition in the European Cup final in 1989, Carolina Pascual, the silver medalist at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Carmen Acedo, who won a gold medal in clubs competition in World Championships in 1993, Almudena Cid, whose four Olympic appearances (1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008) are the most of any rhythmic gymnast, and three-time Olympian Carolina Rodriguez.

Spain is more engaged in group rhythmic gymnastics, and the Spanish group became the first to win the Olympic gold in group rhythmic gymnastics when it was added in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, with the help of the Bulgarian coach Emilia Boneva. The Spanish group was formed by Marta Baldó, Nuria Cabanillas, Estela Giménez, Lorena Guréndez, Tania Lamarca and Estíbaliz Martínez. The Spanish group also won the silver medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

=== Italy ===

Like Spain, Italy is more engaged in group rhythmic gymnastics; since 2004, the Italian group, nicknamed the &#x27;Le Farfalle&#x27; or &#x27;The Butterflies&#x27;, has won nine all-around World Championship medals and three medals (a silver and two bronze) at the Olympic Games.

On the individual level, the 2022 World champion was the Italian Sofia Raffaeli, who also won the bronze medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

=== Israel ===

Israel is a rising nation in rhythmic gymnastics. Israeli head coach Irina Vigdorchik, who moved from Moscow to Israel in 1979, said rhythmic gymnastics had been brought to Israel by Russian immigrants in the early 1970s.

The sport began its success in the 2000s with notable Israeli gymnasts including Irina Risenzon and Neta Rivkin, who placed in top ten in the Olympic Games finals. Linoy Ashram was the first Israeli to win the Olympic all-around gold medal; her win was considered an upset over favorite Dina Averina. Other notable gymnasts include European champion Daria Atamanov.

In the mid-2010s, the Israeli group began to be amongst the leading groups in the World Cup and World Championship competitions and won its first gold medal at the 2016 European Championships. They placed 6th in the Olympic games in both Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. The Israeli group won their first World all-around title in 2023, and they went on to win the all-around silver medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

=== Other European nations ===

Germany had early success in the sport, especially from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, with World medalists Ute Lehmann, Carmen Rischer, Christiana Rosenberg, Bianca Dittrich and 1984 Olympic medalist Regina Weber. In 2023, German Darja Varfolomeev won all five individual gold medals at the 2023 World Championships and went on to win the individual all-around at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

Czechoslovakia dominated the second World Championships, and their routines there, which combined ballet with whole-body movement, influenced the early direction of the sport. The 1960s and 1970s marked the peak of Czechoslovak rhythmic gymnastics success with World medalists Hana Machatová-Bogušovská, Hana Sitnianská-Mičechová, Zuzana Záveská, Iveta Havlíčková and Daniela Bošanská

Romania has enjoyed more success in artistic gymnastics but has also had a presence in individual rhythmic gymnastics (especially in the 1980s and 1990s) with gymnasts like Doina Stăiculescu, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist, and Irina Deleanu.

=== Asia and Americas ===

European countries have been always dominant in this sport: only five World Championships have been held outside Europe so far, one in Cuba, one in the US, and three in Japan, and only five individual gymnasts (Sun Duk Jo, Myong Sim Choi, Mitsuru Hiraguchi, Son Yeon-jae, Kaho Minagawa) and three groups (Japan, North Korea and China) from outside Europe have won medals at the World Championships. However, rhythmic gymnastics is growing in other countries.

Japan has a long tradition in group rhythmic gymnastics. Since their first competition in 1971, the Japanese group, known as &quot;Fairy Japan&quot;, has never finished lower than 10th (except in 2003, 16th) in the all-around at the World Championships. They won their first World medal in 1975, then won their second in 2017, a bronze in the all-around. In 2019, they won their first World gold medal in the 5 balls apparatus final as well as another silver.

Other countries in East Asia have developed world class gymnasts, such as South Korean Son Yeon-jae, who gained popularity in her home country after she finished fifth at the 2012 Summer Olympics and fourth at the 2016 Summer Olympics. China was the first country outside of Europe to medal at the Olympics in the group event (silver at the 2008 Summer Olympics) and was also the first non-European country to win the Olympic title in the group event at the 2024 Summer Olympics.

Although it has not gained as much of a following compared to its artistic gymnastics counterpart in the Americas, it is a rising sport. Beginning in the 1950s, Evelyn Koop, who graduated from the Ernest Idla Institute in Sweden, promoted the sport in the United States and especially in Canada. Andrea Molnár-Bodó, a gold medalist in the Team Portable Apparatus event as a member of the Hungarian team at the 1956 Summer Olympics, moved to the United States after the Olympics and also promoted rhythmic gymnastics there as a coach and judge. The first Olympic champion, competing in the absence of most of the dominant Eastern European countries due to the boycott of the 1984 Olympics, was Canadian Lori Fung. Brazil was also an early participant in rhythmic gymnastics, sending their first gymnast to the third World championships in 1967, and their group choreography was influential in the 1970s.

== Injuries and health issues ==
Studies on rhythmic gymnastics injuries are complicated by changes in the code of points leading to emphasis on different kinds of elements, making it more difficult to generalize the risks from past studies to current competitors. For example, the 2009–2012 code removed elements that led to knee injuries. The development of muscle strength, agility, and speed in rhythmic gymnasts have also been under-studied. A focus on flexibility training without sufficient strength training can lead to injuries, as can forcing turnout in the feet and over-training.

At the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic games, rhythmic gymnasts were injured more often than trampoline gymnasts but less often than artistic gymnasts. Overuse injuries are more common than acute injuries. Gymnasts most frequently report pain and injury in the lower back and lower limbs, such as the hip, knee, or ankle. At the 2013 European Championships, gymnasts were surveyed about pain and compared to a matched group of non-athletes. The gymnasts were more likely to report having pain, with the most frequent reports being of pain in the lumbar spine or ankle; however, they were less likely than the control group to report pain in other areas.

When the apparatuses are thrown, they can cause injury if not caught in time; some gymnasts have been hit in the head or eyes.

=== Eating disorders ===
As in other aesthetic sports such as figure skating and artistic gymnastics, body image issues and disordered eating are common. International-level gymnasts are more likely to have disordered eating and low body weight compared to recreational gymnasts.

Long limbs and a slender body are considered ideal for the sport, and judges may be biased against those who do not fit this ideal. Gymnasts and coaches sometimes believe that a lighter weight will prevent injuries and make it easier to perform elements, and gymnasts have reported excessive weight control from coaches and demands to meet arbitrary weight targets as well as the use of unhealthy methods to lose weight. The pressure to lose weight may increase for gymnasts with a higher body mass index, even if they are still quite thin by typical standards. Other gymnastics authority figures such as judges also encourage gymnasts to lose weight, and parents and friends may do so as well.

=== Spinal issues ===

Lower back pain and spinal issues are a common concern in rhythmic gymnastics due to elements requiring hyper-extension of the spine, a lack of strength needed to properly support back extension, and the number of repetitions gymnasts perform in training. A study of routines performed at the 2019 Junior World Championships found that a number of elements were performed with spinal hyper-extension, particularly leaps.

Rhythmic gymnasts are at increased risk of scoliosis and other spinal issues. It is thought that this may be in part due to rhythmic gymnasts tending to have looser joints and delayed menarche as well as from repeatedly performing elements using the dominant side of the torso. Gymnasts are more susceptible to spinal issues such as scoliosis as they grow older and train for more years. However, former elite-level gymnasts may not be at increased risk of back pain once they have completed their career, though those who do experience pain report experiencing it earlier and tend to have retired earlier than gymnasts without pain. The risk may also depend on the codes of points the gymnast competed under and the emphasis put on back hyper-extension in elements at the time the gymnast competed. At lower levels of the sport, rhythmic gymnastics training may have a protective effect against back pain.

==Men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics==

The FIG only specifies rules for women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics. However, two versions of men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics exist. One developed in Japan and uses a spring floor and a different set of apparatuses, and it was originally competed by both men and women before Western rhythmic gymnastics was brought to Japan. The other began development in Spain and uses the same rules and apparatuses as women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics.

=== Japanese men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics ===
Japanese men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics is performed to music on a x gymnastic spring floor. As with women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics, there are two types of routines: group events (always freehand, meaning no apparatus), originally with six people and with five since 2024, and individual events performed using an apparatus (stick, rings, rope, or clubs). Athletes are judged on some of the same physical abilities and skills as their female counterparts, such as hand/body/eye co-ordination, but they are also permitted to perform tumbling. Strength and power are the main focus, as well as apparatus handling, flexibility and movements called &quot;Toshu&quot; (&quot;freehand&quot;).

In 2021, it was estimated there are about 1,500 participants in Japan, with small individual programs in other countries such as Canada and Russia, and some former gymnasts have moved to the United States to work for Cirque du Soleil. It may be called by other names in other countries, as the feminine stereotype of the term &quot;rhythmic gymnastics&quot; makes it more difficult to recruit boys into programs. Proponents of Japanese-style men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics in other countries sometimes emphasize its perceived masculine qualities in contrast with the Spanish or women&#x27;s version.

==== History ====
Men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics in Japan was originally created by adopting elements from Swedish, Danish, and German gymnastics. It has been taught and performed with the aim of improving physical strength and health as early as the 1940s, and the national intercollegiate competition began in 1949.

Originally, both boys and girls used to perform this type of gymnastics, called &quot;Dantai Toshu Taisou&quot;, literally &quot;group freehand gymnastics&quot;. In 1967, the name &quot;Shintaisou&quot; (&quot;new gymnastics&quot;) was adopted as a translation of &quot;Modern Gymnastics,&quot; which was practiced in Northern and Central Europe in schools such as Medau&#x27;s. Women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics - originally also called &quot;Modern Gymnastics&quot; - was also imported to Japan under the name &quot;Shintaisou&quot;, and women began to perform the international version of the sport instead. However, there are clubs that allow women to train in men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics, and some club competitions include a category for mixed-gender groups. Currently, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics are both under the umbrella of the Japan Gymnastics Association, and major competitions for both are often held at the same venue.

==== Scoring ====
For both individuals and groups, points are divided into three scores: difficulty, artistry, and execution. The first score, difficulty, is based on the technical value of the elements performed in the routine. The artistic score is scored out of a maximum of 10 points and is based on harmony between music and movements, use of space, and originality, with deductions for lack of required elements or stepping out of bounds, and so on. Execution is scored out of a maximum of 10 points, based on quality of execution, accuracy of performance, and synchronization, with deductions taken for mistakes or lack of movements in unison, etc.

For individual performances, a gymnast manipulates one or two pieces of apparatus (double rings, stick, clubs, rope) to demonstrate their skill at apparatus handling, throws, and catches as well as the difficulty of the tumbling. The gymnast must work the entire floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement. The permitted time for individual events is between 1 minute 15 seconds and 1 minute 30 seconds. During a competition, each individual gymnast performs four separate routines, one for each apparatus. The individual scores of all four routines for each gymnast are then added up to decide the all-around winner.

Group performances are done without using any apparatus and focus on synchronization between the athletes and complicated tumbling; teams even train to breathe at the same times. The permitted time for group events is between 2 minutes 15 seconds and 2 minutes 30 seconds.

==== Internationalization ====
Competitors from other countries have been included during the men&#x27;s event at the All-Japan Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships several times; in 2003, gymnasts came from Malaysia, South Korea, Canada, and the United States. The 2005 Championships also included competitors from Australia, Russia, and Mexico. In 2021, Russia began holding a national men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics championships.

In 2013, the Aomori University Men&#x27;s Rhythmic Gymnastics Team collaborated with renowned Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake and American choreographer Daniel Ezralow (Spiderman, Cirque du Soleil) to create a one-hour contemporary performance, &quot;Flying Bodies, Soaring Spirits,&quot; that featured all 27 Aomori men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnasts outfitted in Miyake&#x27;s signature costumes. Held July 18, 2013 at Yoyogi National Stadium in Tokyo, the show drew an audience of 2,600. &quot;Flying Bodies&quot; was also captured in a 78-minute documentary by director Hiroyuki Nakano that follows the coaches, gymnasts and creative team for the three months leading up to the performance. Men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnasts from Aomori University also performed at the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.

=== Spanish men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics ===

In Europe, some male rhythmic gymnasts train and perform in the same way as their female counterparts using generally the same rules as for women&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics. Prominent advocates include Rubén Orihuela (Spain) and Peterson Céüs (France); in Spain, Almudena Cid, a four-time Olympian, has also been a supporter of men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics.

==== History ====
Spain is a pioneer country in men&#x27;s rhythmic gymnastics. In 2005, the Spanish federation allowed men to compete in an open category at the national championships; each autonomous community was allowed to submit two gymnasts in this category, who could be foreign gymnasts or men. In 2009, this category was closed to men after the FIG released a statement that they had no rules for men&#x27;s competition, as rhythmic gymnastics was a sport for women only, because the Spanish federation was afraid of being sanctioned. However, the federation soon announced that there would be a separate category for men using the same rules as the open category. The first year, a dozen gymnasts competed in the men&#x27;s competition. In 2020, a mixed-gender category was added for groups.

In France, men have been allowed to compete in rhythmic gymnastics since 1989. However, they may not compete at the highest levels. In a case brought to the Conseil d&#x27;État, it was ruled that the lack of a men&#x27;s category was not discriminatory. Fewer than 30 male rhythmic gymnasts were registered in 2000; in 2017, 50 were registered, and by 2022, the number had increased to 385.

A small number of men in other countries such as Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy have also trained in rhythmic gymnastics. Some have competed in the Spanish championships.

<doc id="189055" wikidata="Q161095" url="?curid=189055" title="Agnatha">
<text>Agnatha (; ) is a paraphyletic infraphylum of non-gnathostome vertebrates, or jawless fish, in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata, consisting of both living (cyclostomes) and extinct (conodonts, anaspids, and ostracoderms, among others). Among recent animals, cyclostomes are sister to all vertebrates with jaws, known as gnathostomes.

Molecular data, both from rRNA and from mtDNA as well as embryological data, strongly supports the hypothesis that both groups of living agnathans, hagfishes and lampreys, are more closely related to each other than to jawed fish, forming the clade Cyclostomi.

The oldest fossil agnathans appeared in the Cambrian. Living jawless fish comprise about 120 species in total. Hagfish are considered members of the subphylum Vertebrata, because they secondarily lost vertebrae; before this event was inferred from molecular and developmental data, the Craniata hypothesis was accepted (and is still sometimes used as a strictly morphological descriptor) to reference hagfish plus vertebrates.

== Metabolism ==
Agnathans are ectothermic, meaning they do not regulate their own body temperature. Agnathan metabolism is slow in cold water, and therefore they do not have to eat very much. They have no distinct stomach, but rather a long gut, more or less homogeneous throughout its length. Lampreys feed on other fish and mammals. Anticoagulant fluids preventing blood clotting are injected into the host, causing the host to yield more blood. Hagfish are scavengers, eating mostly dead animals. They use a row of sharp teeth to break down the animal. Because agnathan teeth are unable to move up and down it limits their possible food types.

==Morphology==
In addition to the absence of jaws, modern agnathans are characterised by absence of paired fins; the presence of a notochord both in larvae and adults; and seven or more paired gill pouches. Lampreys have a light sensitive pineal eye (homologous to the pineal gland in mammals). All living and most extinct Agnatha do not have an identifiable stomach or any appendages. Fertilization and development are both external. There is no parental care in the Agnatha class. The Agnatha are ectothermic or cold, with a cartilaginous skeleton, and the heart contains 2 chambers.

===Body covering===

In modern agnathans, the body is covered in skin, with neither dermal or epidermal scales. The skin of hagfish has copious slime glands, the slime constituting their defense mechanism. The slime can sometimes clog up enemy fishes&#x27; gills, causing them to die. In direct contrast, many extinct agnathans sported extensive exoskeletons composed of either massive, heavy dermal armour or small mineralized scales.

===Appendages===

Almost all agnathans, including all extant agnathans, have no paired appendages, although most do have a dorsal or a caudal fin. Some fossil agnathans, such as osteostracans and pituriaspids, did have paired fins, a trait inherited in their jawed descendants.

== Reproduction ==

Fertilization in lampreys is external. Mode of fertilization in hagfishes is not known. Development in both groups probably is external. There is no known parental care. Not much is known about the hagfish reproductive process. It is believed that hagfish only have 30 eggs over a lifetime. There is very little of the larval stage that characterizes the lamprey. Lamprey are only able to reproduce once. Lampreys reproduce in freshwater riverbeds, working in pairs to build a nest and burying their eggs about an inch beneath the sediment. The resulting hatchlings go through four years of larval development before becoming adults.

== Evolution ==

Although a minor element of modern marine fauna, agnathans were prominent among the early fish in the early Paleozoic. Two types of Early Cambrian animal apparently having fins, vertebrate musculature, and gills are known from the early Cambrian Maotianshan shales of China: &quot;Haikouichthys&quot; and &quot;Myllokunmingia&quot;. They have been tentatively assigned to Agnatha by Janvier. A third possible agnathan from the same region is &quot;Haikouella&quot;. A possible agnathan that has not been formally described was reported by Simonetti from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia. Conodonts, a class of agnathans which arose in the early Cambrian, remained common enough until their extinction in the Triassic that their teeth (the only parts of them that were usually fossilized) are often used as index fossils from the late Cambrian to the Triassic.

Many Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian agnathans were armored with heavy bony-spiky plates. The first armored agnathans—the ostracoderms, precursors to the bony fish and hence to the tetrapods (including humans)—are known from the middle Ordovician, and by the Late Silurian the agnathans had reached the high point of their evolution. Most of the ostracoderms, such as thelodonts, osteostracans, and galeaspids, were more closely related to the gnathostomes than to the surviving agnathans, known as cyclostomes. Cyclostomes apparently split from other agnathans before the evolution of dentine and bone, which are present in many fossil agnathans, including conodonts. Agnathans declined in the Devonian and never recovered.

Approximately 500 million years ago, two types of recombinatorial adaptive immune systems (AISs) arose in vertebrates. The jawed vertebrates diversify their repertoire of immunoglobulin domain-based T and B cell antigen receptors mainly through the rearrangement of V(D)J gene segments and somatic hypermutation, but none of the fundamental AIS recognition elements in jawed vertebrates have been found in jawless vertebrates. Instead, the AIS of jawless vertebrates is based on variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that are generated through recombinatorial usage of a large panel of highly diverse leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) sequences. Three VLR genes (VLRA, VLRB, and VLRC) have been identified in lampreys and hagfish, and are expressed on three distinct lymphocytes lineages. VLRA+ cells and VLRC+ cells are T-cell-like and develop in a thymus-like lympho-epithelial structure, termed thymoids. VLRB+ cells are B-cell-like, develop in hematopoietic organs, and differentiate into &quot;VLRB antibody&quot;-secreting plasma cells.

== Classification ==
==Phylogeny==

Phylogeny based on the work of Mikko Haaramo and Delsuc et al.

While the &quot;Agnatha&quot; Conodonta was indeed jawless, if it would have continued to live, its descendants would still be closer related to e.g. humans than to lampreys, and also contemporary it was closer related to the ancestor of humans. Due to such considerations, Agnatha can not be consolidated into a coherent grouping without either removing any non-Cyclostomata, or by including all Vertebrata thus rendering it into a junior synonym of Vertebrata.

The new phylogeny from Miyashita &quot;et al&quot;. (2019) is considered compatible with both morphological and molecular evidence.

<text>The Battle of Newburn, also known as the Battle of Newburn Ford, took place on 28 August 1640, during the Second Bishops&#x27; War. It was fought at Newburn, just outside Newcastle, where a ford crossed the River Tyne. A Scottish Covenanter army of 20,000 under Alexander Leslie defeated an English force of 5,000, led by Lord Conway. 

The only significant military action of the war, victory enabled the Scots to take Newcastle, which provided the bulk of London&#x27;s coal supplies, and allowed them to put pressure on the central government. The October 1640 Treaty of Ripon agreed the Covenanter army could occupy large parts of northern England, while receiving £850 per day to cover their costs. The Scots insisted Charles recall Parliament to ratify the peace settlement; he did so in November 1640, a key element in the events leading to the First English Civil War in August 1642.

==Background==
The Protestant Reformation created a Church of Scotland, or &#x27;kirk&#x27;, Presbyterian in structure, and Calvinist in doctrine. Presbyterian churches were ruled by Elders, nominated by congregations; Episcopalian were governed by bishops, appointed by the monarch. In 1584, bishops were imposed on the kirk against considerable resistance; since they also sat in Parliament and usually supported Royal policies, arguments over their role were as much about politics as religion.

The vast majority of Scots, whether Covenanter or Royalist, believed a &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; monarchy was divinely mandated; they disagreed on what &#x27;well-ordered&#x27; meant, and who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. Royalists generally emphasised the role of the monarch more than Covenanters, but there were many factors, including nationalist allegiance to the kirk, and individual motives were very complex. Montrose fought for the Covenant in 1639 and 1640, then became a Royalist, and switching sides was common throughout the period.

When James VI and I succeeded as king of England in 1603, he viewed a unified Church of Scotland and England as the first step in creating a centralised, Unionist state. However, the two churches were very different in doctrine; even Scottish bishops violently opposed many Church of England practices. Widespread hostility to reforms imposed on the kirk by Charles I led to the National Covenant on 28 February 1638. Its signatories vowed to oppose any changes, and included Argyll and six other members of the Scottish Privy Council; in December, bishops were expelled from the kirk.

Charles resorted to military action to assert his authority, resulting in the First Bishops&#x27; War in 1639. His chief Scottish advisor James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton proposed an ambitious three part strategy, in which Scottish Royalists would be supported by additional troops from England and Ireland. However, Charles&#x27; suspension of the Parliament of England during the period of Personal Rule from 1629 to 1640 meant there was insufficient support or money to conduct such operations, which largely failed to materialise. This allowed the Covenanters to consolidate their domestic position by defeating Royalist forces in Aberdeenshire, while the chaotic state of the English army left them unable to mount any effective opposition. 

While the two sides agreed the Treaty of Berwick in June, both saw it primarily as an opportunity to strengthen their position. In April 1640, Parliament was recalled for the first time in eleven years but when it refused to vote taxes without concessions, it was dissolved after only three weeks. Despite this, Charles went ahead, supported by his most capable advisor, the Earl of Strafford. As in 1639, he planned an ambitious three-part attack; an Irish army from the west, an amphibious landing in the north, supported by an English attack from the south. 

Once again, the first two parts failed, while his English troops consisted largely of militia levied in the south, poorly-equipped, unpaid, and unenthusiastic about the war. On the march north, lack of supplies meant they looted the areas they passed through, creating widespread disorder; several units murdered officers suspected of being Catholics, before deserting. Lacking reliable troops, Lord Conway, commander in the north, assumed a defensive posture and focused on reinforcing Berwick-upon-Tweed, the usual starting point for invading England. On 17 August, cavalry units under Montrose crossed the River Tweed, followed by the rest of Leslie&#x27;s army of around 20,000. The Scots bypassed the town, and headed for Newcastle-on-Tyne, centre of the coal trade with London, and a valuable bargaining point.

==Battle==
Since Conway had insufficient men to adequately hold Newcastle and provide a large enough field army to confront Leslie, he left the town with a skeleton garrison and positioned most of his troops near Hexham, gambling on the Scots crossing the River Tyne there. By 27 August, the Scots were approaching Newcastle; supplying such a large army meant Leslie either had to capture it, or retreat. Given the strong defences north of the river, he decided to cross the Tyne at Newburn, then a small village six miles outside Newcastle, which would allow him to attack its weaker, southern side.

On the evening of 27 August, Conway arrived at Newburn with 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry, who began building defences on the south bank of the Tyne, supervised by Colonel Thomas Lunsford. They were joined next morning by Sir Jacob Astley, with another 2,000 infantry, but in addition to being heavily outnumbered, their positions around the ford were almost indefensible. Leslie&#x27;s artillery commander, Alexander Hamilton, was an extremely experienced soldier, who placed his guns on high ground to the north; this provided a clear field of fire on the English troops below, while making them almost impervious to return fire. 

In addition, most of the English artillery was still at Hexham, leaving them only eight light guns with which to reply to the Scottish batteries. Sir Jacob, also a veteran of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, suggested neutralising this disadvantage by withdrawing into the woods further back, but this advice was rejected. While waiting for low tide, Leslie asked Conway to allow his army across to &#x27;deliver a petition to the king&#x27;, which was refused; Conway then received instructions from Strafford, ordering him to prevent a crossing of the ford. In retrospect, retreat might have been a better option; taking Newcastle would have taken time, and English prisoners later reported the Scots had only enough rations for three days.

The battle started around 13:00 when a Scots officer who came too close to the ford was shot, initiating an outbreak of musket fire. Around 300 Covenanter cavalry attempted to cross the river but came under concentrated fire from Lunsford&#x27;s infantry and retreated. Hamilton&#x27;s artillery now began an intense bombardment of the hastily prepared defences around the ford, which they soon dismantled; despite Lunsford&#x27;s efforts to rally them, his troops abandoned their positions, allowing the Scots to cross. A counter-attack by the English cavalry was initially successful, but they were driven back, and their commander Henry Wilmot captured.

Since his cavalry and infantry withdrew in opposite directions, Conway was unable to reform his lines, and by early evening, the English were in full retreat towards Newcastle. One of the few members of the English army to emerge with any credit from the battle was George Monck, who managed to ensure their artillery escaped intact. Both sides suffered around 300 casualties, and Leslie ordered his troops to refrain from pursuit; already in secret contact with John Pym and the Parliamentary opposition, the Scots wanted to avoid making it harder to agree terms.

==Aftermath==
Despite this victory, the Scots still had to take Newcastle, but to Leslie&#x27;s surprise, when they arrived on 30 August, Conway had withdrawn to Durham. One suggestion is he did not trust his ill-disciplined and mutinous troops, but morale in the rest of the army now collapsed, forcing Charles to make peace. Under the October Treaty of Ripon, the Scots were paid £850 per day, and allowed to occupy Northumberland and County Durham pending final resolution of terms. Funding this required the recall of Parliament, and the Scots finally evacuated Northern England after the August 1641 Treaty of London. 

While defeat forced Charles to call a Parliament he could not get rid of, the Irish Rebellion of 1641 was arguably more significant in the struggle that led to war in August 1642. Although both sides agreed on the need to suppress the revolt, neither trusted the other with control of the army raised to do so, and it was this tension that was the proximate cause of the First English Civil War.

Victory confirmed Covenanter control of government and kirk, and Scottish policy now focused on securing these achievements. The 1643 Solemn League and Covenant was driven by concern over the implications for Scotland if Parliament were defeated; like Charles, the Covenanters sought political power through the creation of a unified church of Scotland and England, only one that was Presbyterian, rather than Episcopalian.

However, ease of victory in the Bishops&#x27; Wars meant they overestimated their military capacity and ability to enforce this objective. Unlike Scotland, Presbyterians were a minority within the Church of England, while religious Independents opposed any state church, let alone one dictated by the Scots. One of the most prominent opponents was Oliver Cromwell, who claimed he would fight, rather than agree to such an outcome.

Many of the political radicals known as the Levellers, and much of the New Model Army, belonged to Independent congregations; by 1646, the Scots and their English allies viewed them as a greater threat than Charles. Defeat in the 1648 Second English Civil War resulted in his execution; failure to restore his son in the 1651 Third English Civil War was followed by Scotland&#x27;s incorporation into the Commonwealth, a union made on English terms.

<doc id="189059" wikidata="Q719787" url="?curid=189059" title="Christopher Hill (historian)">
<text>John Edward Christopher Hill (6 February 1912 – 23 February 2003) was an English Marxist historian and academic, specialising in 17th-century English history. From 1965 to 1978 he was Master of Balliol College, Oxford.

==Early life and education==
Christopher Hill was born on 6 February 1912, Bishopthorpe Road, York, to Edward Harold Hill and Janet Augusta (&quot;née&quot; Dickinson). His father was a solicitor and the family were devout Methodists. He attended St Peter&#x27;s School, York. At the age of 16, he sat his entrance examination at Balliol College, Oxford. The two history tutors who marked his papers recognised his ability and offered him a place in order to forestall any chance he might go to the University of Cambridge. In 1931 Hill took a prolonged holiday in Freiburg, Germany, where he witnessed the rise of the Nazi Party, later saying that it contributed significantly to the radicalisation of his politics. 

He matriculated at Balliol College in 1931. In the following year he won the Lothian Prize, and he graduated with a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in modern history in 1934. Whilst at Balliol, Hill became a committed Marxist and joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in the year he graduated. 

Hill has been accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union. Several academics, including Hobsbawm, defended Hill. Further, declassified MI5 documents are reported to have found no evidence of him being a spy.

==Early academic career==
After graduating he became a Fellow of All Souls College. In 1935 he undertook a ten-month trip to Moscow, Soviet Union. There he became fluent in Russian and studied Soviet historical scholarship, particularly that relating to Britain. After returning to England in 1936 he accepted a teaching position as an assistant lecturer at the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in Cardiff. During his time there he attempted to join the International Brigade and fight in the Spanish Civil War, but was rejected. Instead he was active in helping Basque refugees displaced by the war. After two years in Cardiff he returned to Balliol College in 1938 as a Fellow and tutor in history.

==War service==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the British Army, initially as a private in the Field Security Police. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry on 2 November 1940 with the service number 156590. At around this time Hill started to publish his articles and reviews about 17th-century English history. On 19 October 1941 he was transferred to the Intelligence Corps. He was seconded to the Foreign Office from 1943 until the war ended.

==Later academic career and politics==
Hill returned to Oxford University after the war to continue his academic work. In 1946 he and other Marxist historians formed the Communist Party Historians Group. In 1949 he applied for the chair of History at the new Keele University, but was turned down because of his Communist Party affiliations. In 1952 he helped to create the journal &quot;Past and Present&quot;.

Hill was becoming discontented with the lack of democracy in the Communist Party. However, he stayed in the party after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. He left in the spring of 1957 after one of his reports to the party congress was rejected.

After 1956 Hill&#x27;s academic career ascended to new heights. His studies in 17th-century English history were widely acknowledged and recognised. His first academic book, &quot;Economic Problems of the Church from Archbishop Whitgift to the Long Parliament&quot;, appeared in 1956. Like many of his later books, it was based on his study of printed sources accessible in the Bodleian Library and on secondary works produced by other academic historians, rather than on research in the surviving archives. In 1965 Hill was elected Master of Balliol College. He held the post from 1965 to 1978, when he retired (he was succeeded by Anthony Kenny). Among his students at Balliol was Brian Manning, who went on to develop understanding of the English Revolution. At Oxford Hill acted as Senior Member of the exclusive Stubbs Society.

Many of Hill&#x27;s most notable studies focused on 17th-century English history. His books include &quot;Puritanism and Revolution&quot; (1958), &quot;Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution&quot; (1965 and revised in 1996), &quot;The Century of Revolution&quot; (1961), &quot;Anti-Christ in 17th-century England&quot; (1971) and &quot;The World Turned Upside Down&quot; (1972).

Hill retired from Balliol in 1978, when he took up a full-time appointment for two years at the Open University. He continued to lecture from his home at Sibford Ferris, Oxfordshire.

In Hill&#x27;s later years he lived with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and required constant care. He died in a nursing home in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, on 23 February 2003.

==Personal life==
Hill married Inez Waugh (&quot;née&quot; Bartlett) on 17 January 1944. Inez Hill, then 23, was the daughter of an Army officer, Gordon Bartlett, and the ex-wife of Ian Anthony Waugh. The Hills&#x27; marriage broke down after ten years. Their only child, their daughter, Fanny, drowned while holidaying in Spain in 1986.

Hill&#x27;s second wife was Bridget Irene Mason (&quot;née&quot; Sutton), whom he married on 2 January 1956. She was the ex-wife of Stephen Mason, a fellow Communist and historian. Their daughter Kate died in a car accident in 1957. They had two other children: Andrew (born 1958) and Dinah (born 1960).

Hill, along with Hobsbawm, was spied on by MI5 for decades. MI5 found that Abraham Lazarus confessed to an affair with Hill&#x27;s first wife, Inez, in 1948.

<doc id="189062" wikidata="Q63679" url="?curid=189062" title="Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse">
<text>Frederick Charles Louis Constantine, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse (; ; 1 May 1868 – 28 May 1940), was the brother-in-law of the German Emperor, Wilhelm II. He was elected King of Finland on 9 October 1918, but renounced the throne on 14 December 1918.

==Early life==
Frederick was born at his family&#x27;s Panker Castle, in Plön, Holstein. He was the third son of Frederick William of Hesse, Landgrave of Hesse, and his second wife Princess Anna of Prussia, daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia and Princess Marie Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Frederick William, a Danish military officer, had been one (and perhaps the foremost) of the candidates of Christian VIII of Denmark in the 1840s to succeed to the Danish throne if the latter&#x27;s male line died out, but renounced his rights to the throne in 1851 in favor of his aunt, Louise. Frederick William was of practically Danish upbringing, having lived all his life in Denmark, but in 1875, when the senior branch of Hesse-Kassel became extinct, he settled in northern Germany, where the House had substantial landholdings.

==Marriage and issue==

On 25 January 1893, Frederick Charles married Princess Margaret of Prussia, youngest sister of Kaiser Wilhelm II and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. They had six children, all sons, including two sets of twins:

* Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse (23 November 1893 – 12 September 1916), died in World War I, during the Dobrujan campaign
* Maximilian Friedrich Wilhelm Georg (20 October 1894 – 13 October 1914), died in World War I
* Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse (1896–1980), twin with his brother Wolfgang; married Princess Mafalda of Savoy (1902–1944, Buchenwald), daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and had issue.
* Prince Wolfgang of Hesse (1896–1989), twin with his brother Philipp. He was the designated Crown Prince of Finland officially until 14 December 1918. He married Princess Marie Alexandra of Baden, no issue
* Prince Christoph Ernst August of Hesse (1901–1943), twin with his brother Richard. An SS officer who died in active service during World War II, he married Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark (sister of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh) and had issue.
* Prince Richard Wilhelm Leopold (1901–1969), twin with his brother Christoph; unmarried

Upon their father&#x27;s death in 1884, Frederick&#x27;s eldest brother Frederick William became the head of the House of Hesse, and afterwards his next brother Alexander.

==The Finnish throne==

Frederick Charles was elected the &quot;King of Finland&quot; by the Parliament of Finland on 9 October 1918. However, with the end of World War I, in light of his German birth (and despite his Danish roots through his paternal grandmother) and the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany ending monarchies in Germany, the arrangement was quickly considered untenable by influential Finns of the time and by Frederick himself. Not much is known of the official stance of the victorious Allied Powers. Frederick Charles renounced the throne on 14 December 1918, without ever arriving in the country, much less taking up his position. Finland&#x27;s subsequent elections were a victory for anti-monarchists, and the parliament quickly adopted a republican constitution.

The electoral document refers to Prince Frederick Charles with the Finnish name Fredrik Kaarle. Other proposals for a Finnish regnal name included Kaarle and Kaarlo. The regnal name &quot;Väinö I&quot;, which lived on in the memory of the Finns, probably came from a newspaper causerie: in 1927 in &quot;Suomen Sosialidemokraatti&quot;, &quot;Hesekiel&quot; (Heikki Välisalmi) claimed Väinö had been the intended name; already in 1918 in &quot;Uusi Päivä&quot; , &quot;Olli&quot; (Väinö Nuorteva) had suggested &quot;Ilmari, Väinö, Kauko, Jouko, Usko, Jaska?&quot;.

==Later life==
Landgrave Alexander Frederick of Hesse abdicated as the head of the House of Hesse on 16 March 1925, and was succeeded by Frederick Charles, his younger brother.

At Frederick&#x27;s death, his eldest surviving son, Philipp, succeeded him as head.

However, according to certain family documents and correspondence, his successor as King of Finland would have been his second surviving son Prince Wolfgang of Hesse (1896–1989), apparently because Philipp was already the designated heir of the rights over the Electorate of Hesse, but certainly because Wolfgang was with his parents in 1918 and ready to travel to Finland, where a wedding to a Finnish lady was already in preparation for the coming crown prince. Philipp was in the military and unable to be contacted at the time.

<doc id="189082" wikidata="Q4345608" url="?curid=189082" title="High commissioner">
<text>High commissioner is the title of various high-ranking, special executive positions held by a commission of appointment.

The English term is also used to render various equivalent titles in other languages.

==Commonwealth==

===Bilateral diplomacy===

In the Commonwealth of Nations, a high commissioner is the senior diplomat (ranking as an ambassador) in charge of the diplomatic mission of one Commonwealth government to another. In this usage, a Commonwealth nation&#x27;s high commission is its embassy to another Commonwealth nation.

===British colonial usage===

Historically, in the British Empire (most of which would become the Commonwealth) high commissioners were envoys of the imperial government appointed to manage protectorates or groups of territories not fully under the sovereignty of the British Crown, while Crown colonies (which were British sovereign territory) would normally be administered by a governor and the most significant possessions, large confederations and the independent Commonwealth Dominions would be headed by a governor-general.

An example was the island of Cyprus. Until 12 July 1878, Cyprus was under the Ottoman rule based in Istanbul. From that date, it was under British administration, but Istanbul retained nominal sovereignty until Cyprus was fully annexed by Britain on 5 November 1914. There were nine successive high commissioners, all but one already knighted, from 22 July 1878 until on 10 March 1925. Cyprus became a crown colony, and the last incumbent stayed on as its first governor.

The high commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan, who administered Mandatory Palestine, had a considerable effect on the history of Zionism and the early stages of what would become the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

A high commission could also be charged with the last phase of a decolonisation, as in the crown colony of the Seychelles, granted autonomy on 12 November 1970: the last governor, Colin Hamilton Allen (1921–1993), stayed on as the only colonial high commissioner from 1 October 1975, when self-rule under the Crown was granted, until 28 June 1976 when the Seychelles became an independent republic within the Commonwealth.

====British indirect rule====
As diplomatic residents (as diplomatic ranks were codified, this became a lower class than ambassadors and high commissioners) were sometimes appointed to native rulers, high commissioners could likewise be appointed as British agents of indirect rule upon native states. Thus high commissioners could be charged with managing diplomatic relations with native rulers and their states (analogous to the resident minister), and might have under them several resident commissioners or similar agents attached to each state.

In present-day Nigeria:
*Northern Nigeria, three incumbents 1900–1907, the last of whom stayed on as first governor,
*Southern Nigeria, three incumbents 1900–1906 (four terms), the last of whom stayed on as first governor.

In certain regions of particular importance, a commissioner-general would be appointed, to have control over several high commissioners and governors, e.g. the commissioner-general for south-east Asia had responsibility for Malaya, Singapore and British Borneo.

====High commissioners as administrators====
The role of High Commissioner for Southern Africa was coupled with that of British Governor of the Cape Colony in the 19th century, giving the colonial administrator responsibility both for administering British possessions and relating to neighbouring Boer settlements. The best known of these high commissioners, Alfred Milner, who was appointed to both positions in the 1890s, is considered responsible by some for igniting the Second Boer War.

Historically, in southern Africa, the protectorates of Bechuanaland (now Botswana), Basutoland (now Lesotho) and Swaziland (now Eswatini) were administered as &quot;High Commission Territories&quot; by the governor-general of South Africa, who was also the British high commissioner for Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland, until the 1930s, with various local representatives, and subsequently by the British high commissioner (from 1961 ambassador) to South Africa, who was represented locally in each territory by a resident commissioner.

The British governor of the crown colony of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, doubled as high commissioner of the Federated Malay States, and had authority over the resident-general in Kuala Lumpur, who in turn was responsible for the various residents appointed to the native rulers of the Malay states under British protection.

The British Western Pacific Territories were permanently governed as a group of minor insular colonial territories, under one single part-time Western Pacific High Commissioner (1905–1953), an office attached first to the governorship of Fiji, and subsequently to that of the Solomon Islands. He was represented in each of the other islands units by a resident commissioner, consul or other official (on tiny Pitcairn a mere chief magistrate).

Currently there is still one high commissioner who also serves in an additional capacity as a governor: the British high commissioner to New Zealand serves &quot;ex officio&quot; as British colonial Governor of the Pitcairn Islands.
==Other territorial administrators==

===External territories and decolonisation===
In the (post-)colonial sense, some other powers have or previously had high commissioners, or rather the exact equivalent in their language.

====Kingdom of Denmark====
In the Kingdom of Denmark, high commissioners (, , ) represent the crown and the Kingdom Government (&quot;Regeringen&quot;) in Greenland and the Faroe Islands (two self-governing regions of the kingdom – the unity of the Realm) and take part in negotiations on policies and decisions affecting their region including negotiations with the devolved legislatures and the Kingdom Parliament (&quot;Folketinget&quot;). Greenland and the Faroe Islands have one commissioner each.

====French====
Originally the French word Haut Commissaire, or in full Haut Commissaire de la république (High Commissioner of the Republic), was rarely used for governatorial functions, rather &quot;(Lieutenant-)gouverneur(-général)&quot; and various lower titles. Exceptions were:
*since 22 March 1907, the colonial &quot;Gouverneur&quot; of New Caledonia was also appointed as high commissioner in the Pacific Ocean, to co-ordinate with the governors of the French settlements in Oceania and the governors-general of French Indochina; the French resident commissioner of the Anglo-French condominium Nouvelles Hébrides and the residents to the island protectorates of Wallis and Futuna were subordinated to him
**once Charles de Gaulle named someone else as high commissioner for the French Territory of the Pacific and the Far East, January 1941 – 1945: Georges Thierry d&#x27;Argenlieu (b. 1889 – d. 1964), while in December 1941 the Vichy (pro-German) government named Jean Decoux (b. 1884 – d. 1963) to the post (who in fact was only responsible for Wallis and Futuna, which was the only Pacific territory not to have rallied to the Free French at that time).
*In Atlantic waters, from 14 September 1939 until September 1943, four French possessions in the Americas (French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, all in the Caribbean, as well as Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, off the Canadian coast) were temporarily grouped together (from June 1940 under Vichy France, so remaining on the Allied side). The two consecutive &#x27;high commissioners in the Antilles&#x27; (quite a misleading title: French Guiana is in continental South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the Canadian coast, so in North America) held both administrative authority over the local governors and equivalent officers (rather like a &quot;gouverneur général&quot; did elsewhere on a permanent basis) and military command in the &#x27;Theater Atlantic West&#x27;:
**14 September 1939 – 14 July 1943 Georges Robert (b. 1875 – d. 1965)
**14 July 1943 – September 1943 Henri Hoppenot (b. 1891 – d. 1977)

In the later period of decolonisation, the office of high commissioner in a colony to become an allied nation was intended to become remarkably analogous to the Commonwealth&#x27;s &#x27;close relationship diplomats&#x27; in President General De Gaulle&#x27;s project for a French Union to match the Commonwealth, but it soon started to fall apart, so they actually just presided over most of the peaceful decolonisation.
*&quot;Algérie&quot; (Algeria), once similar to Tunis, but incorporated directly into the French Republic, got its only high commissioner on 19 March 1962 – Christian Fouchet (b. 1911 – d. 1974) – until its 3 July 1962 independence from France (Algerian State; 25 September 1962 People&#x27;s Democratic Algerian Republic ruled by the FLN, the former armed revolt)
*in present-day Benin, since 13 October 1946 Dahomey overseas territory, on 4 December 1958 granted autonomy as Republic of Dahomey, the last (acting) governor, René Tirant (b. 1907), stayed on as only high commissioner until the 1 August 1960 independence
*Chad, since 27 October 1946 an overseas territory of France (part of AEF colony) under its own governor, shortly after it was on 28 November 1958 granted autonomy as Republic of Chad, had a single high commissioner from 22 January 1959: Daniel Marius Doustin (b. 1920) until its 11 August 1960 independence from France.
*Congo-Brazzaville (variously named, often Middle Congo) had a single high commissioner, a bit after it was granted on 28 November 1958 autonomy (as Republic of Congo), 7 January 1959 – 15 August 1960: Guy Noël Georgy (b. 1918 – d. 2003) after many lieutenant governors since 11 December 1888 (under the governor-general of AEF, except the several cases when he governed the French Congo personally); afterwards it was an independent republic
*&quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot; (Ivory Coast) had two high commissioners since it was granted autonomy as republic of Ivory Coast:
**4 December 1958 – 15 July 1960 Ernest de Nattes (b. 1908), the last of the long list of governors since 10 March 1893 (colony until 27 October 1946, then overseas territory)
**15 July 1960 – 7 August 1960 Yves René Henri Guéna (b. 1922); thereafter it was an independent republic
*Gabon had two high commissioners since on 28 November 1958 autonomy was granted (as Gabonese Republic) to the former overseas territory (since 1946)
**November 1958 – July 1959 Louis Marius Pascal Sanmarco (b. 1912 – d. 2015), also the last of the governors since 1941 (after various otherwise styled chief executives before; it had since 15 January 1910 been part of French Equatorial Africa, AEF)
**July 1959 – 17 August 1960 Jean Risterucci (b. 1911 – d. 1982); thereafter it was an independent republic
*Mauritania had two high commissioners, after having been a protectorate since 12 May 1903 (under a single military commandant), from 18 October 1904 the French civil territory of Mauritania under a commissioner (part of French West Africa (AOF); under its governor-general in Dakar, Senegal), and since 12 January 1920 a French colony under a lieutenant governor (many incumbents, again under Dakar), on 28 November 1958 obtaining autonomy (as Islamic Republic of Mauritania):
**5 October 1958 – February 1959 Henri Joseph Marie Bernard (b. 1920)
**February 1959 – 28 November 1960 Amédée Joseph Émile Jean Pierre Anthonioz (b. 1913 – d. 1996); since independence from France it had its own president (or a junta chief);
*In Niger, since 13 October 1946 an overseas territory of France (part of French West Africa, see Senegal) under a lieutenant-governor, on 19 December 1958 granted autonomy as Republic of Niger, there was a single high commissioner 25 August 1958 – 10 November 1960: Jean Colombani (b. 1903), i.e. still several months after the formal 3 August 1960 independence whilst there was no president
*In Senegal, since 27 October 1946 an overseas territory of France, which on 25 November 1958 had obtained autonomy (as Republic of Senegal), the last governor stayed on as first (and only?) &quot;Haut commissaire&quot; 25 November 1958 – 20 June 1960: Pierre Auguste Michel Marie Lami (b. 1909); meanwhile on 4 April 1959 the Sudanese Republic (now Mali) and Senegal formed the Mali Federation and his term ended at the 20 June 1960 independence of that Mali Federation from France (on 20 August 1960 the Republic of Senegal withdrew from the thus dissolved Mali Federation).
*in French Sudan, an overseas territory of France since 27 October 1946 (earlier a colony; stayed within French West Africa), which on 24 November 1958 obtained autonomy (as Sudanese Republic), there were two high commissioners:
**3 November 1956 – 24 November 1958 Henri Victor Gipoulon
**24 November 1958 – 20 June 1960 Jean Charles Sicurani (b. 1915 – d. 1977); during his term on 4 April 1959 this Sudanese Republic and Senegal (cfr. above) united to form the Mali Federation; his office ceased at the 20 June 1960 independence of the Mali Federation from France
*In the Republic of Upper Volta (since 4 January 1947 a French territory; present-day Burkina Faso, renamed 4 August 1984), since the 11 December 1958 grant of Autonomy as a &#x27;republic&#x27;, &quot;République de Haute-Volta&quot;, there were two high commissioners:
**11 December 1958 – February 1959 Max Berthet, who stayed on, having been the last (acting) governor
**February 1959 – 5 August 1960 Paul Jean Marie Masson (b. 1920), until the Independence from France as the Republic of Upper Volta.

While the colonies above were generally artificially carved creations, &quot;Haut commissaires&quot; also were appointed by Paris to prepare the (de facto) independence of pre-existing monarchies that had formally been French protectorates, such as:
*Tunisia, known as the Régence (since 3 June 1955 autonomous), where France had a Resident-general (posted with the Basha bey of Tunis, who once the French protectorate was terminated on 20 March 1956 restyled his realm &quot;al-Mamlaka at-Tunisiyya&quot; &#x27;Tunisian Kingdom&#x27;), instead got a high commissioner from 13 September 1955 to 20 March 1956: Roger Seydoux Fornier de Clausonne (b. 1908 – d. 1985); in continued shortly as independent monarchy, but on 25 July 1957 became the Tunisian Republic.

Yet a colony could achieve independence without a high commissioner, e.g. Guinée (French Guinea).

In one case a French &quot;Haut Commissaire&quot; was the exact match and colleague of a British high commissioner: they represented both powers in the south sea condominium (i.e. territory under joint sovereignty) of the New Hebrides, which became the present-day republic of Vanuatu. The current high commissioner of Vanuatu to the US [5 February 2009] is David J. Wilson (born 1956).

A very special category was the Haut Commissaire as &#x27;liquidator&#x27; of a &quot;gouvernement-général&quot; (the colonial echelon grouping several neighbouring colonies under a governor-general), notably:
*in &quot;Afrique Equatoriale Française&quot; (French Equatorial Africa, AEF), three high commissioners:
**4 April 1957 – 29 January 1958 Paul Louis Gabriel Chauvet (b. 1904), also the last of the long list of governors-general since 28 June 1908 (before it had five Commissioners-general since 27 April 1886)
**29 January 1958 – 15 July 1958 Pierre Messmer (b. 1916)
**15 July 1958 – 15 August 1960 Yvon Bourges (b. 1921)
*in &quot;Afrique Occidentale Française (AOF)&quot;, i.e. French West Africa, the last of a long list of governors-general since 1895 stayed on as first of only two high commissioners:
**4 April 1957 – July 1958 Gaston Custin (b. 1903 – d. 1993)
**July 1958 – 22 December 1958 Pierre Messmer (b. 1916)

Another use for the title was found in the rare remaining insulara (formerly no longer colonial) overseas possessions, in these cases still functioning:
*In French Polynesia it is the title of the representative of the French republic in the overseas territory (restyled &#x27;overseas collectivity&#x27; in 2003, &#x27;overseas country&#x27; on 27 February 2004) since 13 July 1977 (until 14 September 1984 he also presided the local council of ministers, that got its own president, as the legislature already had)
*In New Caledonia (&quot;Nouvelle Calédonie&quot; in French, colonised in 1853; its Governors had been high commissioners in the Pacific Ocean from 22 March 1907, see above) the title (commonly corrupted to Haussaire) was chosen for the chief executive on 19 December 1981, when it was an overseas territory (since 1946), even before autonomy was granted on 18 November 1984, and maintained after its status was changed on 20 July 1998 to the unique French &quot;collectivité sui generis&quot;; he represents the Paris government, while there are a native legislature and government.

====Greece====
In early May 1919, the Kingdom of Greece was given a mandate by the Supreme Allied War Council for the city of Smyrna (today İzmir) and its hinterland, which it proceeded to occupy on 12 May. A civilian administration was set up in the &quot;Smyrna Zone&quot;, headed, from 21 May 1919 until 9 September 1922, when Greece lost Smyrna to Turkey, by the high commissioner () Aristeidis Stergiadis (1861–1950).

====Italian====
*while only various military commanders and since 1916 a Secretary for Civil Affairs in Albania (Ugo Capialbi) had acted for Rome since Italy invaded on 27 December 1914 (occupying Valorë and parts of Southern Albania; on 3 June 1917 Albanian independence under an Italian protectorate was declared by Italy, opposed by most Albanians; adding in November 1918 the former Austro-Hungarian occupied areas to the Italian zone), only since in 1919 was an Albanian provisional government recognised by Italy as the legal government of the protected zone, consecutive high commissioners for the Crown were appointed until Italy effectively withdrew its troops on 3 September 1920 (as agreed on 22 August 1920 when Italy formally recognised the total independence of Albania):
**1919–1920 ...
**1920 Fortunato Castoldi
**1920 – 3 September 1920 Gaetano Conti Manzoni
*two incumbents appointed by the kingdom in Fiume (a former Austrian province; now Rijeka in Croatia), after an extraordinary commissionary, on 31 December 1920 declared, short-lived &quot;Independent State of Fiume&quot;, until the accession of its first President
**13 June 1921 – 1921 Antonio Foschini (b. 1872 – d. 19..)
**1921 – 5 October 1921 Luigi Amantea (b. 1869 – d. 19..)
*in Slovenia, which after 6–17 April 1941 Italian-German occupation, was on 17 April 1941 partitioned between Italy, Hungary and Germany, the Italian portion was named province of Lubiana, from 3 May 1941 under a Civil Commissioner, from 3 May 1941 restyled the first of two high commissioners:
**18 April 1941 – 1942 Emilio Grazioli (b. 1869 – d. 1951)
**1942–1943 Giuseppe Lombrassa (b. 1906 – d. 1966)

====Portuguese====
The title Alto Comissário da República (High Commissioner of the Republic) or, simply Alto Comissário, was given to some Portuguese colonial governors to whom were given exceptional, enlarged executive and legislative powers, superior to those of common governors. In the Monarchy, before 1910, they were known as Comissários Régios (Royal Commissioners). &quot;Altos Comissários&quot; (or &quot;Comissários Régios&quot; when indicated) had been nominated for:
*Angola:
**Guilherme Augusto de Brito Capelo (&quot;Comissário Régio&quot;) – 1896–1897
**José Mendes Ribeiro de Norton de Matos – 1921–1923
**Francisco da Cunha Rego Chaves – 1925–1926
**António Vicente Ferreira – 1926–1928
**Filomeno da Câmara Melo Cabral – 1929–1930
*Cabo Verde (Cape Verde):
**Vicente Almeida d&#x27;Eça – 30 December 1974 – 5 July 1975
*Portuguese India:
**João António de Brissac das Neves Ferreira (&quot;Comissário Régio&quot;) – 1896–1897
*Mozambique:
**António Enes (&quot;Comissário Régio&quot;) – 1895
**José Francisco de Azevedo e Silva – 1911–1912
**Manuel de Brito Camacho – 1921–1923
**Vitor Hugo de Azevedo Coutinho – 1924–1926
*São Tomé and Príncipe:
**António Elísio Capelo Pires Veloso – 18 December 1974 (three days before the formal granting of autonomy), actually the last of many governors (since 1753, before both islands were separate), staying on until it became an independent republic on 12 July 1975
*Portuguese Timor:
**José Joaquim Lopes de Lima (&quot;Comissário Régio&quot;) – 1851–1852

====Spanish====
Alto comisario was the Spanish title of the official exercing the functions of a governor in the following colonial possessions:
*Equatorial Guinea had three consecutive high commissioners:
**15 December 1963 – 1964 Francisco Núñez Rodríguez (b. 1902 – d. 1972), also the last of many Governors since 7 June 1494
**1964–1966 Pedro Latorre Alcubierre
**1966 – 12 October 1968 Víctor Suances Díaz del Río; his term ended when it became an independent republic

The title &quot;Alto Comisario&quot; was also used for the representative of Spain in its &quot;protectorate zone&quot; within the Sherifan sultanate of Morocco (most of the country was under French protectorate), known as &quot;el Jalifato&quot; after the Khalifa (), the Sultan&#x27;s fully mandated, princely Viceroy in this protectorate, to which the high commissioner was formally accredited, but whose senior he was in reality.
In 1934–1956 the Governors of the Western Sahara (which from 27 November 1912 were also Governors-general of Spanish West Africa) were subordinated to him.
The office was filled by the governors of Spanish West Africa from 1939 to 1956.

====United States====
*While being a U.S. protectorate from 1905 to 1941, the Dominican Republic had first various native regimes, then U.S. military Governors 29 November 1916 – 24 July 1922, and just before it again had the first of its own presidents on 21 October 1922, a single U.S. high commissioner, Sumner Welles, who served from 1922 to 1924.
*Haiti, the other (western) half of the island of Hispaniola, had a similar experience. It was a U.S. protectorate from 1915 to 1936, after five U.S. military commanders, there was one high commissioner, John H. Russell, Jr., who served from 11 February 1922 to 16 November 1930.
*Following World War I, Rear Admiral Mark Lambert Bristol served as United States high commissioner for Turkey from 1919 to 1927.
*The Philippines became a United States unincorporated territory on 13 August 1898. After gaining autonomy on 15 November 1935, it had the following high commissioners:
**1935–1937 William Francis &quot;Frank&quot; Murphy, who was also the last governor-general over the Islands.
**1937–1939 Paul V. McNutt (first commission)
**1939 – 7 September 1942 Francis Bowes Sayers (exiled in the U.S. from 24 December 1942 during the Japanese Occupation).
**7 September 1942 – 4 July 1946 Paul V. McNutt (second commission; exiled in the U.S. until August 1945 during the Japanese Occupation). Term ended when the Philippines achieved full sovereignty.
*Okinawa and Ryukyu Islands (Japanese archipelago), and later just Okinawa had six U.S. high commissioners:
**4 July 1957 – 1 May 1958 James Edward Moore. Moore was also the last Deputy governor and Commanding General, Ryukyu Islands Command.
**1 May 1958 – 12 February 1961 Donald Prentice Booth.
**16 February 1961 – 31 July 1964 Paul Wyatt Caraway.
**1 August 1964 – 31 October 1966 Albert Watson II.
**2 November 1966 – 28 January 1968 Ferdinand Thomas Unger.
**28 January 1968 – 15 May 1972 James Benjamin Lampert. On 15 May 1972, pursuant to the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement, Okinawa reverted to Japanese sovereignty as a prefecture; therefore, the office of U.S. high commissioner on Okinawa ceased to exist.

===Temporary administration of acquired territories===
In many cases, a political vacuum created by war, occupation or other events discontinuing a country&#x27;s constitutional government has been filled by those able to do so, one nation or often an alliance, installing a transitional (often minimal) governance administered by, or under supervision of, one or more high commissioners representing it/them.

Examples of multilaterally appointed administrations are discussed further below. Examples of administrations appointed during decolonisation processes are described above. Examples of non-colonial transitional administrations titled &quot;High Commissioners&quot; are:

*22 November 1918 – 1919 Alsace-Lorraine, until then part of the defeated German Empire as Elsaß-Lothringen but just occupied by and restored to France, was under &quot;haut commissaire&quot; Maringer (it would be only fully reintegrated in 1925, after three Commissioners General)
*When Mussolini&#x27;s Italy occupied Montenegro 17 April 1941 – 10 September 1943, it first appointed a (nominal) governor (17 May 1941 – 23 July 1941? Mihajlo Ivanovic), then a civil commissioner 29 April 1941 – 22 May 1941 &quot;Conte&quot; Serafino Mazzolini (b. 1890 – d. 1945), who next stayed on as high commissioner (from 12 July 1941, also styled Regent at the proclamation of nominal independence under Italian control, but exiled King Mihajlo I refused the throne, when offered the Montenegrin crown; Prince Roman Petrovich of Russia (b. 1896 – d. 1978) also refused to be enthroned) until 23 July 1941 followed by two Governors before the German occupation

==Domestic high commissioners==
*In France, a high commissioner, in French &quot;haut-commissaire&quot;, is a civil servant appointed by the President of France to some high-level position within France:
** The high commissioner for atomic energy is the head of the CEA
** cfr. &quot;Haute Autorité&quot;.
*In Portugal, high commissioner (&quot;alto comissário&quot; in Portuguese) is the title of certain officials appointed by the President, the Parliament or the Government to deal with special matters of national importance (e.g.: the High Commissioner for Immigration and Intercultural Dialogue is the government official responsible for the immigration and ethnic minorities affairs).

==Multilaterally mandated==

===Representing an international alliance===

====Crete====

After the naval blockade of Crete in 1898 by France, Italy, Russia and the United Kingdom, Crete became an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire. These protecting powers appointed the following as High Commissioner () until 1908, when the Cretan Assembly unilaterally declared union with Greece (with Crete subsequently formally becoming part of Greece in 1913, after the Balkan Wars):
* 1898–1906 Prince George of Greece
* 18 September 1906 – 24 September 1908 Alexandros Zaimis

====Constantinople====
Following the capitulation of the Ottoman Empire in the Armistice of Mudros, on 8 December 1918 the Allies occupied the shores of the Bosporus, the Dardanelles, the eastern coast of the Sea of Marmara up to 15 km deep, and the islands of Imbros, Lemnos, Samothrace and Tenedos. The entire area demilitarised (Zone of the Straits). This was complemented from 16 March to 10 August 1920 as the Allies occupied the Ottoman capital Constantinople (Istanbul). Until the termination of Allied occupation on 22 October 1923, there were at all times one British Senior Allied High Commissioner and one (junior) Allied High Commissioner (incumbents from France, thrice, Italy and the US, each twice).

====Post–World War II====
Often the main/locally concerned members of an alliance would not set up a joint occupation authority (as in Italy after the Nazi defeat) but simply each appoint one for each of the zones into which they physically divided amongst themselves an occupied state or territory, e.g. after World War II:

* In Austria, until 27 July 1955 when Allied occupation ended, restoring Austrian sovereignty, it was administered as a British Zone (six consecutive high commissioners, July 1945), a US Zone (four incumbents from 5 July 1945), a Soviet Zone (four from July 1945; only this had first been under a military governor from 8 April 1945), and a French Zone (two, from 8 July 1945);
* In Germany there were also four major occupation zones: the British Zone (after three consecutive military governors from 22 May 1945, the last stayed on as first of three consecutive high commissioners 21 September 1949 – 5 May 1955), the US Zone (after five military governors from 8 May 1945, four high commissioners 2 September 1949 – 5 May 1955), the Soviet Zone (after a military commander April 1945 – 9 June 1945 who stayed as first of three military governors 9 June 1945 – 10 October 1949, the last of whom stayed on as only Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission 10 October 1949 – 28 May 1953, two high commissioners 28 May 1953 – 20 September 1955), and the French Zone (after a military commander from May 1945 and a Military governor from July 1945, a single high commissioner 21 September 1949 – 5 May 1955); the Nazi capital, Berlin, enclaved in the Soviet zone, was separately quartered under four military city commanders; only the small Dutch zone by the border with the Netherlands was destined for annexation in 1949, so it was divided up in two districts, each under a landdrost (Tudderen, attached to the province of (Dutch) Limburg and Elten, attached to Gelderland province), but returned to Germany after compensation payments and minor border corrections on 11 August 1963.

===Representing an international organisation===
As the &#x27;world community&#x27; became a widely accepted ideal in diplomacy and was embodied first in the League of Nations and later the United Nations, these often came to play a key role in extraordinary situations that would earlier probably have been dealt with by states as above, sometimes reflected in the appointment of high commissioners under their auspices, sometimes just from the same leading powers, sometimes rather from &#x27;neutral&#x27; member states.

The title of High Commissioner was specifically used for the administrators during the &#x27;emancipation from colonial rule&#x27; of League of Nations mandates and United Nations Trust Territories, i.e. non-sovereign states under a &#x27;transitional&#x27; regime established under the authority of the League of Nations or the UN, respectively, to prepare them for full independence.

These &#x27;guardianships&#x27; most often were simply awarded to the former colonial power or if that was a loser in the preceding World War, to the &#x27;liberating&#x27; Allied victor(s). The trust territories have all now attained self-government or independence, either as separate nations or by joining neighbouring independent countries.

*The UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (originally comprising Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Northern Mariana Islands and Palau), after Allied military occupations, since 18 July 1947, had a dozen high commissioners, also presiding over the splitting off of Palau and Marshall Islands in 1980 and the 10 May 1979 granting of autonomy to the Federated States of Micronesia (former Ponape, Truk and Yap districts of the Trust Territory) until on 3 November 1986 the Trust Territory was dissolved by the US (a single Director of the Office of Transition, Charles Jordan, stepped in from 3 November 1986 – 30 September 1991, a while after the 22 December 1990 proclamation of final independence as the UN Security Council ratified the termination of US trusteeship).

=====Other UN administration=====
*After the former Italian colony of Eritrea had been under victor Britain&#x27;s administration since 5 May 1941, a specific United Nations administration, under Britain, was installed on 19 February 1951, under a UN high commissioner, Edoardo Anze Matienzo (Bolivian, b. 1902), whose office ceased on 15 September 1952 when it was federated with Ethiopia under the sovereignty of the Ethiopian emperor.

=====Representing the world universally=====
At the United Nations and affiliated global organisations, a high commissioner serves as the permanent chief executive of a commission composed of representatives of various member nations.

* the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who has the rank of under-secretary-general, serves the United Nations Human Rights Commission. In fact in 2005, the US ambassador at the UN complained that the incumbent, as a &#x27;civil servant&#x27;, was not authorised to act upon information (in this case worldwide press reports on abnormal detention forms in the &#x27;war against terrorism&#x27; suspected to breach the rights of the suspects) not obtained by the organisation&#x27;s official channels.
* the UN High Commissioner for Refugees heads the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

====Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe====

*High Commissioner on National Minorities

<doc id="189088" wikidata="Q282069" url="?curid=189088" title="A Perfect Murder">
<text>A Perfect Murder is a 1998 American crime thriller film directed by Andrew Davis and starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen. It is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1954 film &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, though the characters&#x27; names have been changed and much of the plot has been rewritten and altered from its original form. Loosely based on the play by Frederick Knott, the screenplay was written by Patrick Smith Kelly.

==Plot==
Wall Street financier Steven Taylor is married to the much younger Emily. Meanwhile, a smitten Emily is having an affair with artist David Shaw, for whom she considers leaving Steven. Steven arrives at David&#x27;s art studio the next day. Steven not only knows about the affair, but has carefully researched David&#x27;s past. His real identity is Winston Lagrange, an ex-convict who cons rich women. Pointing out that he can easily send him back to prison, Steven instead recruits David into murdering Emily for $500,000.

Steven takes Emily&#x27;s housekey and hides it outside the service entrance to their lavish Manhattan co-op apartment. David is to use the key to enter the apartment, kill her, and make it look like a robbery gone bad. At his weekly card game, Steven takes a break and uses his cellphone to make a call to an automated bank system, confirming his alibi, while using a second phone to call Emily. Emily answers in the kitchen and is attacked by a masked assailant, but stabs him in the neck with a meat thermometer. Steven returns, but finds the assailant&#x27;s body. He takes the key from the body, puts it back on Emily&#x27;s keychain, damages the service entrance door, and plants a screwdriver on the assailant. The NYPD arrives, led by Detective Moe Karaman. They remove the assailant&#x27;s mask, but the body is not David&#x27;s.

Soon after, Steven receives a call from David, who plays an audio tape of the two discussing the plan to kill Emily. They agree to meet at a local deli, where David demands the full $500,000 or he will turn Steven in.

Feeling suspicious, Emily confides in her friends that Steven would have inherited her whole $100 million fortune had she been killed. She quietly makes inquiries and learns that Steven&#x27;s extremely risky margin trades on the stock market are unraveling. If he is unable to find enough money to cover the balance urgently, both Steven&#x27;s finances and his credit will be completely wiped out.

Also realizing the key on her keychain belongs to the assailant, Emily confronts Steven. He explains that David is blackmailing them by threatening to kill Emily and Steven has been paying him off quietly to protect her from harm. When he saw her dead assailant in their kitchen, he assumed it was David and took the key from his pocket to shield Emily from facing murder charges. Despite Emily&#x27;s tears and pleading, Steven lovingly insists that she is not to call the police.

After exchanging the money, Steven kills David in a private compartment on an Amtrak train, taking David&#x27;s gun and the money. As he dies, a laughing David reveals he mailed the tape to Emily via courier service. Steven rushes home and finds the mail still unopened. He hides the money, gun and audio tape in his safe before showering.

Emily confronts him. She reveals that she knows everything, having found the tape in the safe and listened to it while he showered. As she turns away, Steven attacks her, vowing she will only leave him dead. After a brief fight, Emily grabs David&#x27;s gun from the safe and kills Steven. NYPD Detective Karaman later comforts a heartbroken Emily, telling her not to blame herself; as she had no choice but to kill Steven in self defense.

==Cast==

* Michael Douglas as Steven Taylor
* Gwyneth Paltrow as Emily Bradford Taylor
* Viggo Mortensen as David Shaw
* David Suchet as Detective Mohamed &quot;Moe&quot; Karaman
* Sarita Choudhury as Raquel Martinez
* Constance Towers as Sandra Bradford
* Novella Nelson as Ambassador Alice Wills
* Michael P. Moran as Bobby Fain
* Gerry Becker as Roger Brill
* Will Lyman as Jason Gates
* David Eigenberg as Stein

==Comparisons to the original film==

In Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot;, the characters played by Ray Milland and Grace Kelly are depicted as living in a modest London flat, although it is implied that they are quite wealthy, as Milland&#x27;s character, Tony Wendice, is a retired tennis champion. Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s characters are also shown as an extremely wealthy couple. Both Kelly and Paltrow&#x27;s characters are shown as striking blondes. Both films make use of the mystery of the fact that no key was found on the dead man when he was killed by both Kelly and Paltrow&#x27;s characters, as both their husbands had removed them in an attempt to pin the crime on their wives. Toward the beginning of &quot;Dial M For Murder&quot;, when Kelly and Robert Cummings are shown together in the Wendice flat, and Milland comes home, Kelly greets him with &quot;There you are!&quot; and kisses him. Presumably in homage to the original film, Douglas&#x27;s character greets Paltrow exactly the same way when she arrives home to their apartment at the beginning of &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot;.

Throughout the film, Emily carries an Hermès Kelly bag, named after Grace Kelly who was often photographed carrying the model of purse.

The title &quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; matches the translation that was made in some countries of Hitchcock&#x27;s film, known in Italian as &quot;Il delitto perfetto&quot; and in Spanish as &quot;Crimen perfecto&quot;; in French it was &quot;Le crime était presque parfait.&quot;

==Production==
Principal photography began on October 14, 1997. Filming took place in &amp; around New York City. The location of Steven &amp; Emily&#x27;s apartment was filmed at The Convent of The Sacred Heart building in Manhattan. The Bradford Mansion was filmed at the Salutation House in Long Island. Filming ended on January 13, 1998.

==Alternate ending==
An alternate ending exists and is presented, with optional commentary, on the original Blu-ray disc release. In this version, Steven comes back from finding the key replaced where he had hidden it and Emily confronts him in the kitchen rather than in their foyer. The scene plays out with the same dialogue, but Steven never physically attacks her. He still tells her that the only way she&#x27;ll leave him is dead, and she shoots him. Steven then says &quot;You won&#x27;t get away with this&quot; before dying and Emily purposely injures herself, making it look like self-defense.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; opened in second place at the box office behind &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, grossing $16,615,704 during its first weekend. It ended up with a total worldwide gross of $128,038,368.

===Critical response===
&quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; received mixed reviews from critics.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;skillfully plotted update of Frederick Knott&#x27;s play&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented, &quot; I’ve seen far worse thrillers than “A Perfect Murder,” but the movie is finally more competent than it is pleasurable. All that lingers from it is the color of money.&quot;

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted, &quot;The trouble is, we don&#x27;t really much care about this philandering billionaire glamour puss, who seems perfectly capable of taking care of herself. We don&#x27;t care about her husband or lover either. The story&#x27;s most compelling character, an Arab American detective (the superb British actor David Suchet), becomes a minor player here. Nevertheless, like John Williams in the Hitchcock film, Suchet commits the film&#x27;s only believable crime: He steals the show.&quot;

Paul Clinton of CNN observed, &quot;This production is stylishly mounted... Douglas is an excellent actor and a gifted producer. However, he should hang up his spurs when it comes to playing a romantic lead with women in their twenties.&quot;

Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, wrote &quot;[It] works like a nasty little machine to keep us involved and disturbed; my attention never strayed&quot;. Meanwhile, James Berardinelli wrote that the film &quot;has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, leaving behind the nearly-unwatchable wreckage of a would-be &#x27;90s thriller.&quot;

&quot;A Perfect Murder&quot; holds a 54% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 56 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;A slick little thriller that relies a bit too much on surprise events to generate suspense.&quot; It has a score of 50/100, based on 22 reviews (&quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;) from Metacritic.

<doc id="189092" wikidata="Q929833" url="?curid=189092" title="Rare disease">
<text>A rare disease is any disease that affects a small percentage of the population. In some parts of the world, the term orphan disease describes a rare disease whose rarity results in little or no funding or research for treatments, without financial incentives from governments or other agencies. Orphan drugs are medications targeting orphan diseases.

Most rare diseases are genetic in origin and thus are present throughout the person&#x27;s entire life, even if symptoms do not immediately appear. Many rare diseases appear early in life, and about 30% of children with rare diseases will die before reaching their fifth birthdays. Fields condition is considered the rarest known disease, affecting three known individuals, two of whom are identical twins. With four diagnosed patients in 27 years, ribose-5-phosphate isomerase deficiency is considered the second rarest.

While no single number has been agreed upon for which a disease is considered rare, several efforts have been undertaken to estimate the number of unique rare diseases. In 2019, the Monarch Initiative released a rare disease subset of the Mondo ontology that reconciles a wide variety of rare disease knowledge sources, such as OMIM and Orphanet. This was the first count since 1983, demonstrating that there were &gt;10,500 rare diseases where prior estimates had been ~7,000 in the Orphan Drug Act. Global Genes has also estimated that currently approximately 10,000 rare diseases exist globally, with 80% of these having identified genetic origins.

==Definition==
There is no single, widely accepted definition for rare diseases. Some definitions rely solely on the number of people living with a disease, and other definitions include other factors, such as the existence of adequate treatments or the severity of the disease.

In the United States, the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 defines &quot;rare disease&quot; strictly according to prevalence, specifically &quot;any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States&quot;, or about 1 in 1,500 people. This definition is essentially the same as that of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, a federal law that was written to encourage research into rare diseases and possible cures.

In Japan, the legal definition of a rare disease is one that affects fewer than 50,000 patients in Japan, or about 1 in 2,500 people.

The European Commission on Public Health defines rare diseases as &quot;life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases which are of such low prevalence that special combined efforts are needed to address them&quot;. The term &quot;low prevalence&quot; is later defined as generally meaning fewer than 1 in 2,000 people. Diseases that are statistically rare, but not also life-threatening, chronically debilitating, or inadequately treated, are excluded from their definition.

The definitions used in the medical literature and by national health plans are similarly divided, with definitions ranging from 1/1,000 to 1/200,000.
==Relationship to orphan diseases==
Because of definitions that include reference to treatment availability, a lack of resources, and severity of the disease, the term &quot;orphan disease&quot; is frequently used as a synonym for &quot;rare disease&quot;. But in the United States and the European Union, &quot;orphan diseases&quot; have a distinct legal meaning.

The United States&#x27; Orphan Drug Act includes both rare diseases and any non-rare diseases &quot;for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will [be] recovered from sales in the United States of such drug&quot; as &quot;orphan diseases&quot;.

The European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) also includes both rare diseases and neglected diseases into a larger category of &quot;orphan diseases&quot;.

==Prevalence==
Prevalence (number of people living with a disease at a given moment), rather than incidence (number of new diagnoses in a given year), is used to describe the impact of rare diseases. The Global Genes Project estimates some 300 million people worldwide are affected by a rare disease.

The European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) estimates that between 3.5 and 5.9% of the world&#x27;s population is affected by one of approx. 6,000 distinct rare diseases identified to-date. European Union has suggested that between 6 and 8% of the European population could be affected by a rare disease sometime in their lives.

About 80% of rare diseases have a genetic component and only about 400 have therapies, according to Rare Genomics Institute.

Rare diseases can vary in prevalence between populations, so a disease that is rare in some populations may be common in others. This is especially true of genetic diseases and infectious diseases. An example is cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease: it is rare in most parts of Asia but relatively common in Europe and in populations of European descent. In smaller communities, the founder effect can result in a disease that is very rare worldwide being prevalent within the smaller community. Many infectious diseases are prevalent in a given geographic area but rare everywhere else. Other diseases, such as many rare forms of cancer, have no apparent pattern of distribution but are simply rare. The classification of other conditions depends in part on the population being studied: All forms of cancer in children are generally considered rare, because so few children develop cancer, but the same cancer in adults may be more common.

Estimating the incidence and prevalence of rare diseases is a complex process due to their wide range of prevalence rates. Rare diseases with higher prevalences can be estimated through a screening panel or patient registries, while diseases which are exceedingly rare may only be able to be estimated through a multi-step nationwide reporting process or case reports. Therefore, the data is often incomplete and complex to amalgamate, compare, and update continually. The Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences curates and compiles rare disease prevalence and incidence from PubMed articles and abstracts using a combination of deep learning algorithms and rare disease experts.

About 40 rare diseases have a far higher prevalence in Finland; these are known collectively as Finnish heritage disease. Similarly, there are rare genetic diseases among the Amish religious communities in the US and among ethnically Jewish people.

==Characteristics==
A rare disease is defined as one that affects fewer than 200,000 people across a broad range of possible disorders. Chronic genetic diseases are commonly classified as rare. Among numerous possibilities, rare diseases may result from bacterial or viral infections, allergies, chromosome disorders, degenerative and proliferative causes, affecting any body organ. Rare diseases may be chronic or incurable, although many short-term medical conditions are also rare diseases.

==Public research and government policy==
===United States===
The NIH&#x27;s Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) was established by H.R. 4013/Public Law 107–280 in 2002. H.R. 4014, signed the same day, refers to the &quot;Rare Diseases Orphan Product Development Act&quot;. Similar initiatives have been proposed in Europe. The ORDR also runs the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network (RDCRN). The RDCRN provides support for clinical studies and facilitating collaboration, study enrollment and data sharing.

===United Kingdom===
In 2013, the United Kingdom government published &quot;The UK Strategy for Rare Diseases&quot; which &quot;aims to ensure no one gets left behind just because they have a rare disease&quot;, with 51 recommendations for care and treatment across the UK to be implemented by 2020. Health services in the four constituent countries agreed to adopt implementation plans by 2014, but by October 2016, the Health Service in England had not produced a plan and the all-party parliamentary group on Rare, Genetic and Undiagnosed Conditions produced a report &quot;Leaving No One Behind: Why England needs an implementation plan for the UK Strategy for Rare Diseases&quot; in February 2017. In March 2017 it was announced that NHS England would develop an implementation plan. In January 2018 NHS England published its &quot;Implementation Plan for the UK Strategy for Rare Diseases&quot;. In January 2021 the Department of Health and Social Care published the &quot;UK Rare Diseases Framework&quot;, a policy paper which included a commitment that the four nations would develop action plans, working with the rare disease community, and that &quot;where possible, each nation will aim to publish the action plans in 2021&quot;. NHS England published &quot;England Rare Diseases Action Plan 2022&quot; in February 2022.

===International===
Organisations around the world are exploring ways of involving people affected by rare diseases in helping shape future research, including using online methods to explore the perspectives of multiple stakeholders.

== Public awareness ==
Rare Disease Day is held in Europe, Canada, the United States, and India on the last day of February (thus, in leap years, on February 29, the rarest day) to raise awareness for rare diseases. There are a number of non-profit and charitable organisations which push for further awareness, interest, and engagement in the subject of rare diseases, including EURORDIS, Genetic Alliance UK, and the &quot;Rare Revolution Magazine&quot;.

<doc id="189093" wikidata="Q661015" url="?curid=189093" title="Esophageal achalasia">
<text>Esophageal achalasia, often referred to simply as achalasia, is a failure of smooth muscle fibers to relax, which can cause the lower esophageal sphincter to remain closed. Without a modifier, &quot;achalasia&quot; usually refers to achalasia of the esophagus. Achalasia can happen at various points along the gastrointestinal tract; achalasia of the rectum, for instance, may occur in Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease. The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscle between the esophagus and stomach that opens when food comes in. It closes to avoid stomach acids from coming back up. A fully understood cause to the disease is unknown, as are factors that increase the risk of its appearance. Suggestions of a genetically transmittable form of achalasia exist, but this is neither fully understood, nor agreed upon.

Esophageal achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder involving the smooth muscle layer of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). It is characterized by incomplete LES relaxation, increased LES tone, and lack of peristalsis of the esophagus (inability of smooth muscle to move food down the esophagus) in the absence of other explanations like cancer or fibrosis. Conversely, achalasia can provoke other diseases, in particular esophageal cancer is an important concern. The impaired transmission of food may cause candidiasis in the esophagus, which in turn is a risk factor for cancer. 

Achalasia is characterized by difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation, and sometimes chest pain. Diagnosis is reached with esophageal manometry and barium swallow radiographic studies. Various treatments are available, although none cures the condition. Certain medications or botox may be used in some cases, but more permanent relief is brought by esophageal dilatation and surgical cleaving of the muscle (Heller myotomy or POEM).

The most common form is primary achalasia, which has no known underlying cause. It is due to the failure of distal esophageal inhibitory neurons. However, a small proportion occurs secondary to other conditions, such as esophageal cancer, Chagas disease (an infectious disease common in South America) or Triple-A syndrome. Achalasia affects about one person in 100,000 per year. There is no gender predominance for the occurrence of disease. The term is from &quot;&quot; + &quot;-chalasia&quot; &quot;no relaxation.&quot;

Achalasia can also manifest alongside other diseases as a rare syndrome such as achalasia microcephaly.

==Signs and symptoms==
The main symptoms of achalasia are dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), regurgitation of undigested food, chest pain behind the sternum, and weight loss. Dysphagia tends to become progressively worse over time and to involve both fluids and solids. Some people may also experience coughing when lying in a horizontal position.
The chest pain experienced, also known as cardiospasm and non-cardiac chest pain can often be mistaken for a heart attack. It can be extremely painful in some patients. Food and liquid, including saliva, are retained in the esophagus and may be inhaled into the lungs (aspiration).
Untreated, mid-stage achalasia can fully obstruct the passage of almost any food or liquid – the greater surface area of the swallowed object often being more difficult to pass the LES/LOS (lower esophageal sphincter). At such a stage, upon swallowing food, it entirely remains in the esophagus, building up and stretching it to an extreme size in a phenomenon known as megaesophagus. If enough food builds up, it triggers a need to purge what was swallowed, often described as not being accompanied with nausea per se, but an intense and sometimes uncontrollable need to vomit what was built up in the esophagus that, due to the excessive stretching of the esophageal walls, is easily released without heaving. This cycle is so that little to practically no food reaches the small intestines to have its nutrients be absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to progressive weight loss, anorexia, eventual starvation, and death, the final of which may not always be listed as &quot;death by achalasia&quot;, contributing to the already inaccurate or inconclusive count of deaths caused by the disease, not to mention the variable of other medical factors that could accelerate death of an achalasia patient&#x27;s already weakened body.

===Late-stage achalasia===
End-stage achalasia, typified by a massively dilated and tortuous oesophagus, may occur in patients previously treated but where further dilatation or myotomy fails to relieve dysphagia or prevent nutritional deterioration, and esophagectomy may be the only option.

End stage disease, characterised by a markedly dilated and tortuous &quot;burned-out&quot; esophagus and recurrent obstructive symptoms, may require oesophageal resection in order to restore gastro-intestinal function, reverse nutritional deficits and reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia.

A review of the literature shows similar results with good symptom control reported in 75–100% of patients undergoing such a procedure. However, oesophagectomy is not without risk, and every patient must be fully informed of all associated risks. Reported mortality rates of 5–10% are described, while morbidity rates of up to 50% have been reported, and anastomotic leak in 10–20% of patients. Patients must also be informed of longer-term complications. Anastomotic stricture has been reported in up to 50% of patients, depending on length of post-operative follow-up. Dumping syndrome, reported in up to 20% of patients, tends to be self-limiting and may be managed medically if necessary, and vagal-sparing oesophagectomy may reduce this risk.

==Mechanism==
The cause of most cases of achalasia is unknown. LES pressure and relaxation are regulated by excitatory (e.g., acetylcholine, substance P) and inhibitory (e.g., nitric oxide, vasoactive intestinal peptide) neurotransmitters. People with achalasia lack noradrenergic, noncholinergic, inhibitory ganglion cells, causing an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The result is a hypertensive nonrelaxed esophageal sphincter.

Autopsy and myotomy specimens have, on histological examination, shown an inflammatory response consisting of CD3/CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes, variable numbers of eosinophils and mast cells, loss of ganglion cells, and neurofibrosis; these events appear to occur early in achalasia. Thus, it seems there is an autoimmune context to achalasia, most likely caused by viral triggers. Other studies suggest hereditary, neurodegenerative, genetic and infective contributions.

==Diagnosis==

Due to the similarity of symptoms, achalasia can be mistaken for more common disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatus hernia, and even psychosomatic disorders.
Specific tests for achalasia are barium swallow and esophageal manometry. In addition, endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (esophagogastroduodenoscopy or EGD), with or without endoscopic ultrasound, is typically performed to rule out the possibility of cancer. The internal tissue of the esophagus generally appears normal in endoscopy, although a &quot;pop&quot; may be observed as the scope is passed through the non-relaxing lower esophageal sphincter with some difficulty, and food debris may be found above the LES.

===Barium swallow===

The patient swallows a barium solution, with continuous fluoroscopy (X-ray recording) to observe the flow of the fluid through the esophagus. Normal peristaltic movement of the esophagus is not seen. There is acute tapering at the lower esophageal sphincter and narrowing at the gastro-esophageal junction, producing a &quot;bird&#x27;s beak&quot; or &quot;rat&#x27;s tail&quot; appearance. The esophagus above the narrowing is often dilated (enlarged) to varying degrees as the esophagus is gradually stretched over time. An air-fluid margin is often seen over the barium column due to the lack of peristalsis. A five-minutes timed barium swallow can provide a useful benchmark to measure the effectiveness of treatment.

===Esophageal manometry===

Because of its sensitivity, manometry (esophageal motility study) is considered the key test for establishing the diagnosis. A catheter (thin tube) is inserted through the nose, and the patient is instructed to swallow several times. The probe measures muscle contractions in different parts of the esophagus during the act of swallowing. Manometry reveals failure of the LES to relax with swallowing and lack of functional peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophagus.

Characteristic manometric findings are:
* Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to relax upon wet swallow (&lt;75% relaxation)
* Pressure of LES &lt;26 mm Hg is normal, &gt;100 is considered achalasia, &gt; 200 is nutcracker achalasia.
* Aperistalsis in esophageal body
* Relative increase in intra-esophageal pressure as compared with intra-gastric pressure

===Biopsy===
Biopsy, the removal of a tissue sample during endoscopy, is not typically necessary in achalasia but if performed shows hypertrophied musculature and absence of certain nerve cells of the myenteric plexus, a network of nerve fibers that controls esophageal peristalsis. It is not possible to diagnose achalasia by means of biopsy alone.

==Treatment==
Sublingual nifedipine significantly improves outcomes in 75% of people with mild or moderate disease. It was classically considered that surgical myotomy provided greater benefit than either botulinum toxin or dilation in those who fail medical management. However, a recent randomized controlled trial found pneumatic dilation to be non-inferior to laparoscopic Heller myotomy.

===Lifestyle changes===
Both before and after treatment, achalasia patients may need to eat slowly, chew very well, drink plenty of water with meals, and avoid eating near bedtime. Raising the head off the bed or sleeping with a wedge pillow promotes emptying of the esophagus by gravity. After surgery or pneumatic dilatation, proton pump inhibitors are required to prevent reflux damage by inhibiting gastric acid secretion, and foods that can aggravate reflux, including ketchup, citrus, chocolate, alcohol, and caffeine, may need to be avoided. If untreated or particularly aggressive, irritation and corrosion caused by acids can lead to Barrett&#x27;s esophagus.

===Medication===
Drugs that reduce LES pressure are useful. These include calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin. However, many patients experience unpleasant side effects such as headache and swollen feet, and these medications often stop helping after several months.

Botulinum toxin (botox) may be injected into the lower esophageal sphincter to paralyze the muscles holding it shut. As in the case of cosmetic botox, the effect is only temporary and lasts about 6 months. Botox injections cause scarring in the sphincter which may increase the difficulty of later Heller myotomy. This therapy is recommended only for patients who cannot risk surgery, such as elderly people in poor health. Pneumatic dilatation has a better long term effectiveness than botox.

===Pneumatic dilatation===
In balloon (pneumatic) dilation or dilatation, the muscle fibers are stretched and slightly torn by forceful inflation of a balloon placed inside the lower esophageal sphincter. There is always a small risk of a perforation which requires immediate surgical repair. Pneumatic dilatation causes some scarring which may increase the difficulty of Heller myotomy if the surgery is needed later. Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) occurs after pneumatic dilatation in many patients. Pneumatic dilatation is most effective in the long-term on patients over the age of 40; the benefits tend to be shorter-lived in younger patients due to the body&#x27;s higher rate of recovery from trauma, often resulting in repeat procedures with larger balloons to achieve maximum effectiveness. After multiple failures using pneumatic dilation, surgeries such as the more consistently successful Heller myotomy can be attempted instead.

===Surgery===
Heller myotomy helps 90% of achalasia patients. It can usually be performed by a keyhole approach or laparoscopically. The myotomy is a lengthwise cut along the esophagus, starting above the LES and extending down 1 to 2 cm onto the gastric cardia. The esophagus is made of several layers, and the myotomy cuts only through the outside muscle layers which are squeezing it shut, leaving the inner mucosal layer intact.

A partial fundoplication or &quot;wrap&quot;, where the fundus (Part of the stomach which hangs above the connection to the oesophagus) is wrapped around said lower oesophagus and sewn to itself, secured to the diaphragm to create pressure on the sphincter post-myotomy, is generally added in order to prevent excessive reflux, which can cause serious damage to the esophagus over time. After surgery, patients should keep to a soft diet for several weeks to a month, avoiding foods that can aggravate reflux.
The most recommended fundoplication to complement Heller myotomy is Dor fundoplication, which consists of a 180- to 200-degree anterior wrap around the esophagus. It provides excellent results as compared to Nissen&#x27;s fundoplication, which is associated with higher incidence of postoperative dysphagia.

The shortcoming of laparoscopic esophageal myotomy is the need for a fundoplication. On the one hand, the myotomy opens the esophagus, while on the other hand, the fundoplication causes an obstruction. Recent understanding of the gastroesophageal antireflux barrier/valve has shed light on the reason for the occurrence of reflux following myotomy. The gastroesophageal valve is the result of infolding of the esophagus into the stomach at the esophageal hiatus. This infolding creates a valve that extends from 7 o&#x27;clock to 4 o&#x27;clock (270 degrees) around the circumference of the esophagus. Laparoscopic myotomy cuts the muscle at the 12 o&#x27;clock position, resulting in incompetence of the valve and reflux. Recent robotic laparoscopic series have attempted a myotomy at the 5 o&#x27;clock position on the esophagus away from the valve. The robotic lateral esophageal myotomy preserves the esophageal valve and does not result in reflux, thereby obviating the need for a fundoplication. The robotic lateral esophageal myotomy has had the best results to date in terms of the ability to eat without reflux.

=== Endoscopic myotomy ===
A new endoscopic therapy for achalasia management was developed in 2008 in Japan. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy or POEM is a minimally invasive type of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery that follows the same principle as the Heller myotomy. A tiny incision is made on the esophageal mucosa through which an endoscope is inserted. The innermost circular muscle layer of the esophagus is divided and extended through the LES until about 2 cm into the gastric muscle. Since this procedure is performed entirely through the patient&#x27;s mouth, there are no visible scars on the patient&#x27;s body.

Patients usually spend about 1–4 days in the hospital and are discharged after satisfactory examinations. Patients are discharged on full diet and generally able to return to work and full activity immediately upon discharge. Major complications are rare after POEM and are generally managed without intervention. Long term patient satisfaction is similar following POEM compared to standard laparoscopic Heller myotomy.

POEM has been performed on over 1,200 patients in Japan and is becoming increasingly popular internationally as a first-line therapy in patients with achalasia.

===Monitoring===
Even after successful treatment of achalasia, swallowing may still deteriorate over time. The esophagus should be checked every year or two with a timed barium swallow because some may need pneumatic dilatations, a repeat myotomy, or even esophagectomy after many years. In addition, some physicians recommend pH testing and endoscopy to check for reflux damage, which may lead to a premalignant condition known as Barrett&#x27;s esophagus or a stricture if untreated.

== History of the understanding and treatment of achalasia ==
* In 1672, the English physician Sir Thomas Willis, one of the founders of the Royal Society first described the condition now known as achalasia and treated the problem with a dilation using a sea sponge attached to a whale bone.
* In 1881, the German Polish-Austrian physician Johann Freiherr von Mikulicz-Radecki described the disease as cardiospasm, and felt it was a functional problem rather than a mechanical one.
* In 1913, Ernest Heller became the first person to successfully perform an esophagomyotomy, now known in his namesake as the Heller myotomy.
* In 1929, two physicians – Hurt and Rake – figured out that the problem was due to the LES not relaxing. They named the disease achalasia, meaning &quot;inability to relax&quot;.
* In 1937, the physician F.C. Lendram affirmed the conclusions of Hurt and Rake in 1929, forwarding the usage of the term &quot;achalasia&quot; over &quot;cardiospasm&quot;.
* In 1955, the German physician Rudolph Nissen, a student of Ferdinand Sauerbruch, performed the first fundoplomy, now known in his namesake as the Nissen fundoplication, eventually publishing the results of two cases in a 1956 copy of &quot;Swiss Medical Weekly&quot;.
* In 1962, the physician Dor reported the first &quot;anterior&quot; partial fundoplication, acting as a solution to the intense post-surgery GERD and risk of stomach acid inhalation accompanying Heller myotomy.
* In 1963, the physician Toupet reported the first &quot;posterior&quot; partial fundoplication.
* In 1991, the physician Shimi and his colleagues performed the first laparoscopic Heller myotomy in England.
* In 1994, Paricha et al. introduced botox as a method for reducing LES pressure.
* In 2008, the newest method of surgically treating achalasia, the per-oral endoscopic myotomy, was devised by H. Inoue in Tokyo, Japan. This method is currently considered experimental in many countries such as the United States.

==Epidemiology==
Incidence of achalasia has risen to approximately 1.6 per 100,000 in some populations. Disease affects mostly adults between ages 30s and 50s.

==Notable patients==
Planetary scientist Carl Sagan had achalasia from the age of 18.
The Zambian government announced that the President of Zambia Edgar Lungu has achalasia, bearing symptoms that sometimes occur during official engagements, in particular lightheadedness.

<text>The following is a list of all [[Metro station|stations]] of the [[Paris Métro]]. As of the end of January 2025, there are a total of 321 stations on 16 different lines.

==Introductory notes==
* Stations are often named after a square or a street, which, in turn, is named for something or someone else.
* A number of stations, such as or , are named after Paris neighbourhoods (though not necessarily located in them), whose names, in turn, usually go back to former villages or hamlets that have long since been incorporated into the city of Paris.
* The use of double names, such as or , often goes back to two (or more) stations on separate lines that were originally named independently and became associated as interchange stations. Notably, is an interchange station consisting of the original Marcadet on Line 4 and the original Poissonniers on Line 12. In many instances, however, the practice of double naming was extended to other stations, usually because these stations are located at the intersection of streets carrying these names. Examples include and .
* Many stations have been renamed during the last century. There have been periods of history during which a significant number of stations were renamed. For example, once Germany declared war on France in 1914, it was decided to rename Berlin as and Allemagne (French for &quot;Germany&quot;) as . The period during which the most stations were renamed was undoubtedly the post-World War II period; Marbeuf at the centre of the Champs-Élysées was renamed in 1946 and Aubervilliers-Villette was renamed the same year.

<doc id="189095" wikidata="Q308999" url="?curid=189095" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">
<text>The Battle of Leyte Gulf () 23–26 October 1944, was the largest naval battle of World War II and by some criteria the largest naval battle in history, with over 200,000 naval personnel involved. 

By the time of the battle, Japan had fewer capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) left than the Allied forces had total aircraft carriers in the Pacific, which underscored the disparity in force strength at that point in the war. Regardless, the Imperial Japanese Navy () mobilized nearly all of its remaining major naval vessels in an attempt to defeat the Allied invasion of the Philippines, but it was repulsed by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Third and Seventh Fleets.

The battle consisted of four main separate engagements (the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Cape Engaño, and the Battle off Samar), as well as lesser actions. Allied forces announced the end of organized Japanese resistance on the island of Leyte at the end of December.

It was the first battle in which Japanese aircraft carried out organized &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, and it was the last naval battle between battleships in history. The Japanese navy suffered heavy losses and never sailed in comparable force thereafter since it was stranded for lack of fuel in its bases for the rest of the war.

==Background==
The Allied campaigns of August 1942 to early 1944 had pushed the Japanese forces from many of their island bases in the south and central Pacific Ocean, while isolating many of their other bases (most notably in the Solomon Islands, Bismarck Archipelago, Admiralty Islands, New Guinea, Marshall Islands, and Wake Island), and in June 1944, a series of American amphibious landings supported by Fifth Fleet&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force captured most of the Mariana Islands (bypassing Rota). This offensive breached Japan&#x27;s strategic inner defense ring and gave the Americans a base from which long-range Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers could attack the Japanese home islands.

The Japanese counterattacked in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The U.S. Navy destroyed three Japanese aircraft carriers, damaged other ships, and shot down approximately 600 Japanese aircraft, leaving the Japanese Navy with very little carrier-borne air power and few experienced pilots. However, the considerable land-based air power the Japanese had amassed in the Philippines was thought too dangerous to bypass by many high-ranking officers outside the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Admiral Chester Nimitz.

===Formosa vs. Philippines as invasion target===
The next logical step was to cut Japan&#x27;s supply lines to Southeast Asia, depriving them of fuel and other necessities of war, but there were two different plans for doing so. Admiral Ernest J. King, other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Admiral Nimitz favored blockading Japanese forces in the Philippines and invading Formosa (Taiwan), while U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur, wanting to fulfill the 1942 promise &quot;I shall return&quot;, championed an invasion of the Philippines.

While Formosa could also serve as a base for an invasion of mainland China, which MacArthur felt was unnecessary, it was also estimated that it would require about 12 divisions from the Army and Marines. Meanwhile, the Australian Army, spread thin by engagements in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, the Dutch East Indies and various other Pacific islands, would not have been able to spare any troops for such an operation. As a result, an invasion of Formosa, or any operation requiring much larger ground forces than were available in the Pacific in late 1944, would be delayed until the defeat of Germany freed the necessary manpower.

===Decision to invade the Philippines===
A meeting between MacArthur, Nimitz, and President Roosevelt helped confirm the Philippines as a strategic target but did not reach a decision, and the debate continued for two months. Eventually Nimitz changed his mind and agreed to MacArthur&#x27;s plan, and it was eventually decided that MacArthur&#x27;s forces would invade the island of Leyte in the central Philippines. Amphibious forces and close naval support would be provided by Seventh Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid.

==Setup for the battle==
The U.S. Seventh Fleet at this time contained units of the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. Before the major naval actions in Leyte Gulf had begun, and were severely damaged by air attacks; during the battle proper these two cruisers were retiring, escorted by , for repairs at the major Allied base at Manus Island, away.

===Lack of unified command structures===
U.S. Third Fleet, commanded by Admiral William F. Halsey Jr., with Task Force 38 (TF38, the Fast Carrier Task Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher), as its main component, would provide more distant cover and support for the invasion. A fundamental defect in this plan was there would be no single American naval admiral in overall command. Kinkaid fell under MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander Southwest Pacific Area, whereas Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet reported to Nimitz as Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas. This lack of unity of command, along with failures in communication, was to produce a crisis and very nearly a strategic disaster for the American forces. Coincidentally the Japanese plan, using three separate fleets, also lacked an overall commander.

===Japanese plans===
The American options were apparent to the . Combined Fleet Chief Soemu Toyoda prepared four &quot;victory&quot; plans: &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 1 (, &quot;&quot;) was a major naval operation in the Philippines, while &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 2, &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 3 and &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 4 were responses to attacks on Formosa, the Ryukyu Islands, and the Kurile Islands, respectively. The plans were for complex offensive operations committing nearly all available forces to a decisive battle, despite substantially depleting Japan&#x27;s slender reserves of fuel oil.

On 12 October 1944, Halsey began a series of carrier raids against Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands with a view to ensuring that the aircraft based there could not intervene in the Leyte landings. The Japanese command, therefore, put &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 2 into action, launching waves of air attacks against Third Fleet&#x27;s carriers. In what Admiral Halsey refers to as a &quot;knock-down, drag-out fight between carrier-based and land-based air&quot;, the Japanese were routed, losing 600 aircraft in three days – almost their entire air strength in the region. Following the American invasion of the Philippines, the Japanese Navy made the transition to &quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 1.

&quot;Shō-Gō&quot; 1 called for Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s ships—known as the &quot;Northern Force&quot;—to lure the main American covering forces away from Leyte. Northern Force would be built around several aircraft carriers, but these would have very few aircraft or trained aircrew. The carriers would serve as the main bait. As the U.S. covering forces were lured away, two other surface forces would advance on Leyte from the west. The &quot;Southern Force&quot; under Vice Admirals Shoji Nishimura and Kiyohide Shima would strike at the landing area via the Surigao Strait. The &quot;Center Force&quot; under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita—by far the most powerful of the attacking forces—would pass through the San Bernardino Strait into the Philippine Sea, turn southwards, and then also attack the landing area.
==Submarine action in Palawan Passage (23 October 1944)==

(Note: This action is referred to by Morison as &#x27;The Fight in Palawan Passage&#x27;, and elsewhere, occasionally, as the &#x27;Battle of Palawan Passage&#x27;.)

As it sortied from its base in Brunei, Kurita&#x27;s powerful &quot;Center Force&quot; consisted of five battleships (, , , , and ), ten heavy cruisers (, , , , , , , , and ), two light cruisers ( and ) and 15 destroyers.

Kurita&#x27;s ships passed Palawan Island around midnight on 22–23 October. The American submarines and were positioned together on the surface close by. At 01:16 on 23 October, &quot;Darter&quot;″s radar detected the Japanese formation in the Palawan Passage at a range of . Her captain promptly made visual contact. The two submarines quickly moved off in pursuit of the ships, while &quot;Darter&quot; made the first of three contact reports. At least one of these was picked up by a radio operator on &quot;Yamato&quot;, but Kurita failed to take appropriate antisubmarine precautions.

&quot;Darter&quot; and &quot;Dace&quot; traveled on the surface at full power for several hours and gained a position ahead of Kurita&#x27;s formation, with the intention of making a submerged attack at first light. This attack was unusually successful. At 05:24, &quot;Darter&quot; fired a salvo of six torpedoes, at least four of which hit Kurita&#x27;s flagship, the heavy cruiser &quot;Atago&quot;. Ten minutes later, &quot;Darter&quot; made two hits on &quot;Atago&quot;″s sister ship, &quot;Takao&quot;, with another spread of torpedoes. At 05:56, &quot;Dace&quot; made four torpedo hits on the heavy cruiser &quot;Maya&quot; (sister to &quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Takao&quot;).

&quot;Atago&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; quickly sank. &quot;Atago&quot; sank so rapidly that Kurita was forced to swim to survive. He was rescued by the Japanese destroyer , and then later transferred to the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;.

&quot;Takao&quot; turned back to Brunei, escorted by two destroyers, and was followed by the two submarines. On 24 October, as the submarines continued to shadow the damaged cruiser, &quot;Darter&quot; ran aground on the Bombay Shoal. All efforts to get her off failed; she was abandoned; and her entire crew was rescued by &quot;Dace&quot;. Efforts to scuttle &quot;Darter&quot; over the course of the next week all failed, including torpedoes from &quot;Dace&quot; and that hit the reef (and not &quot;Darter&quot;) and deck-gun shelling from &quot;Dace&quot; and later . After multiple hits from his 6-inch deck guns, the &quot;Nautilus&quot; commander determined on 31 October that the equipment on &quot;Darter&quot; was only good for scrap and left her there. The Japanese did not bother with the wreck.

&quot;Takao&quot; retired to Singapore, being joined in January 1945 by &quot;Myōkō&quot;, as the Japanese deemed both crippled cruisers irreparable and left them moored in the harbor as floating anti-aircraft batteries.

==Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (24 October 1944)==
Despite its great strength, Third Fleet was not well-placed to deal with the threat. On 22 October, Halsey had detached two of his carrier groups to the fleet base at Ulithi to take on provisions and rearm. When &quot;Darter&quot;″s contact report came in, Halsey recalled Davison&#x27;s group, but allowed Vice Admiral John S. McCain, with the strongest of TF 38&#x27;s carrier groups, to continue towards Ulithi. Halsey finally recalled McCain on 24 October—but the delay meant the most powerful American carrier group played little part in the coming battle and Third Fleet was therefore effectively deprived of nearly 40% of its air strength for most of the engagement. On the morning of 24 October, only three groups were available to strike Kurita&#x27;s force, and the one best positioned to do so—Gerald F. Bogan&#x27;s Task Group 38.2 (TG 38.2)—was by mischance the weakest of the groups, containing only one large carrier——and the light carriers and .

Meanwhile, Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi directed three waves of aircraft from his First Air Fleet based on Luzon against the carriers of Rear Admiral Frederick Sherman&#x27;s TG 38.3 (whose aircraft were also being used to strike airfields in Luzon to prevent Japanese land-based air attacks on Allied shipping in Leyte Gulf). Each of Ōnishi&#x27;s strike waves consisted of some 50 to 60 aircraft.
Most of the attacking Japanese planes were intercepted and shot down or driven off by Hellcats of Sherman&#x27;s combat air patrol, most notably by two fighter sections from led by Commander David McCampbell (who shot down a record nine of the attacking planes in this one action, after which he managed to return and land &quot;in extremis&quot; on because the &quot;Essex&quot;″s deck was too busy to accommodate him although he had run short of fuel).

However, one Japanese aircraft (a Yokosuka D4Y3 &quot;Judy&quot;) slipped through the defences, and at 09:38 hit the light carrier with a armor-piercing bomb. Just prior to the bomb hitting the carrier ten fighter planes had landed on the flight deck from a previous mission and in the hangar deck six fully loaded and fueled Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers were waiting for the next mission. One of the torpedo bombers was directly hit by this bomb as it pierced the ship and exploded, triggering the other five torpedo bombers to also explode. The bomb hit the area of the ship where not only most of the torpedoes were stored but also bombs that were not stored securely. The resulting explosion caused a severe fire in &quot;Princeton&quot;″s hangar and her emergency sprinkler system failed to operate. As the fire spread rapidly, a series of secondary explosions followed. The fire was gradually brought under control, but at 15:23 there was an enormous explosion (probably in the carrier&#x27;s bomb stowage aft), causing more casualties aboard &quot;Princeton&quot;, and even heavier casualties—241 dead and 412 wounded—aboard the light cruiser which was coming back alongside to assist with the firefighting. &quot;Birmingham&quot; and the three destroyers , and remained with the stricken carrier after she fell out of formation. The destroyers initially attempted to come alongside and spray the burning carrier to help the ship&#x27;s crew suppress the fires, but they repeatedly collided with &quot;Princeton&quot; in the heavy seas. &quot;Birmingham&quot; then came alongside instead, as her larger hull could better absorb collisions. &quot;Birmingham&quot; was so badly damaged, she was forced to retire. The light cruiser and destroyers &quot;Morrison&quot; and &quot;Irwin&quot; were also damaged. All efforts to save &quot;Princeton&quot; failed, and after the remaining crew members were evacuated, she was finally scuttled—torpedoed by &quot;Reno&quot;—at 17:50. Of &quot;Princeton&quot;″s crew, 108 men were killed, while 1,361 survivors were rescued by nearby ships. USS &quot;Princeton&quot; was the largest American ship lost during the battles around Leyte Gulf, and the only fast carrier sunk in combat during the war. 17 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 12 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers went down with &quot;Princeton&quot;.

Planes from the carriers &quot;Intrepid&quot; and of Bogan&#x27;s group attacked at about 10:30, scoring hits on the battleships &quot;Nagato&quot;, &quot;Yamato&quot;, and &quot;Musashi&quot;, and badly damaging the heavy cruiser &quot;Myōkō&quot; which retired to Borneo via Coron Bay. A second wave from &quot;Intrepid&quot;, &quot;Essex&quot; and later attacked, with VB-15 Helldivers and VF-15 Hellcats from &quot;Essex&quot;, scoring another 10 hits on &quot;Musashi&quot;. As she withdrew, listing to port, a third wave from &quot;Enterprise&quot; and hit her with an additional 11 bombs and eight torpedoes. After being struck by at least 17 bombs and 19 torpedoes, &quot;Musashi&quot; finally capsized and sank at about 19:35.

In all, five fleet carriers and one light carrier of Third Fleet flew 259 sorties with bombs carried by Helldivers and torpedoes launched by TBF Avengers against Center Force on 24 October, but this weight of attack was not nearly sufficient to neutralize the threat from Kurita. The largest effort of the Sibuyan Sea attack was directed against just one battleship, &quot;Musashi&quot;, which was sunk, and the cruiser &quot;Myōkō&quot; was also crippled by an aerial torpedo. Nevertheless, every other ship in Kurita&#x27;s force remained battleworthy and able to advance. It would be the desperate action and great sacrifice of the much weaker force of six slow escort carriers, three destroyers, four destroyer escorts, and 400 aircraft at the Battle off Samar, utterly lacking in credible weapons to sink armored ships, to stop Kurita. It also contrasts with the 527 sorties flown by Third Fleet against Ozawa&#x27;s much weaker carrier decoy Northern Force on the following day.

Kurita turned his fleet around to get out of range of the aircraft, passing the crippled &quot;Musashi&quot; as his force retreated. Halsey assumed that this retreat signified that his threat was dealt with for the time being. Kurita, however, waited until 17:15 before turning around again to head for the San Bernardino Strait. As a result of a momentous decision taken by Admiral Halsey and some unclear communication of his plans, Kurita was able to proceed through the San Bernardino Strait during the night to make an unexpected and dramatic appearance off the coast of Samar the following morning, directly threatening the Leyte landings.

==Task Force 34 / San Bernardino Strait==
After the Japanese Southern and Center forces had been detected, but before it had been engaged or Ozawa&#x27;s carriers had been located, Halsey and the staff of Third Fleet, aboard the battleship , prepared a contingency plan to deal with the threat from Kurita&#x27;s Center Force. Their intention was to cover San Bernardino Strait with a powerful task force of fast battleships supported by two of Third Fleet&#x27;s equally swift carrier groups. The battleship force was to be designated Task Force 34 (TF34) and to consist of four battleships, five cruisers, and 14 destroyers under the command of Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee. Rear Admiral Ralph E. Davison of TG38.4 was to be in overall command of the supporting carrier groups.

At 15:12 on 24 October, Halsey sent an ambiguously worded telegraphic radio message to his subordinate task group commanders giving details of this contingency plan:
Halsey sent information copies of this message to Admiral Nimitz at Pacific Fleet headquarters and Admiral King in Washington, but he did not include Admiral Kinkaid (Seventh Fleet) as an information addressee. The message was picked up by Seventh Fleet anyway as it was common for admirals to direct radio operators to copy all message traffic they detected whether intended for them or not. Because Halsey intended TF34 as a contingency to be formed and detached &quot;when&quot; he ordered it, by writing &quot;will be formed,&quot; he meant the future tense, but he neglected to say when TF34 &quot;would&quot; be formed or under what circumstances. This omission led Admiral Kinkaid of Seventh Fleet to believe Halsey was speaking in the present tense, so he concluded TF34 &quot;had been formed&quot; and would take station off the San Bernardino Strait. Kinkaid&#x27;s light escort carrier group, lacking battleships for naval action and set up to attack ground troops and submarines, not capital ships, positioned itself south of the strait to support the invasion force. Admiral Nimitz, in Pearl Harbor, reached exactly the same conclusion.

Halsey did send out a second message at 17:10 clarifying his intentions in regard to TF34:
Unfortunately, Halsey sent this second message by voice radio, so Seventh Fleet did not intercept it (due to the range limitations of the ship-to-ship voice radio networks in use at the time) and Halsey did not follow up with a telegraphic message to Nimitz or King, or vitally, Kinkaid. The serious misunderstanding caused by Halsey&#x27;s imperfect wording of his first message and his failure to notify Nimitz, King, or Kinkaid of his second clarifying message had a profound influence on the subsequent course of the battle as Kurita&#x27;s major force almost overwhelmed Kinkaid&#x27;s unprepared lighter force on the doorstep of the Leyte landings.

==Halsey&#x27;s decision (24 October 1944)==
Third Fleet&#x27;s aircraft failed to locate Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force until 16:40 on 24 October. This was largely because Third Fleet had been preoccupied with attacking Kurita&#x27;s sizable Center Force and defending itself against the Japanese air strikes from Luzon. Thus the one Japanese force that remained to be discovered – Ozawa&#x27;s tempting decoy of a large carrier group, which actually had only 108 aircraft – was the only force the Americans had not been able to find. On the evening of 24 October, Ozawa intercepted a (mistaken) American communication describing Kurita&#x27;s withdrawal; he therefore began to withdraw, too. However, at 20:00, Toyoda ordered all his forces to attack &quot;counting on divine assistance.&quot; Trying to draw Third Fleet&#x27;s attention to his decoy force, Ozawa reversed course again and headed southward towards Leyte.

Halsey fell for the Japanese decoy, convinced the Northern Force constituted the main Japanese threat, and he was determined to seize what he saw as a golden opportunity to destroy Japan&#x27;s last remaining carrier strength. Believing Center Force had been neutralized by Third Fleet&#x27;s air strikes earlier in the day in the Sibuyan Sea, and its remnants were retiring, Halsey radioed (to Nimitz and Kinkaid):
The words &quot;with three groups&quot; proved dangerously misleading. In the light of the intercepted 15:12 24 October &quot;... will be formed as Task Force 34&quot; message from Halsey, Admiral Kinkaid and his staff assumed, as did Admiral Nimitz at Pacific Fleet headquarters, that TF 34—commanded by Vice Admiral Lee—had now been formed as a separate entity. They assumed that Halsey was leaving this powerful surface force guarding the San Bernardino Strait (and covering Seventh Fleet&#x27;s northern flank), while he took his three available carrier groups northwards in pursuit of the Japanese carriers. But Task Force 34 had not been detached from his other forces, and Lee&#x27;s battleships were on their way northwards with Third Fleet&#x27;s carriers. As Woodward wrote: &quot;Everything was pulled out from San Bernardino Strait. Not so much as a picket destroyer was left&quot;.

===Warning signs ignored===
Halsey and his staff officers ignored information from a night reconnaissance aircraft operating from the light carrier that Kurita&#x27;s powerful surface force had turned back towards the San Bernardino Strait and that, after a long blackout, the navigation lights in the strait had been turned on. When Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan—commanding TG 38.2—radioed this information to Halsey&#x27;s flagship, he was rebuffed by a staff officer, who tersely replied &quot;Yes, yes, we have that information.&quot; Vice Admiral Lee, who had correctly deduced that Ozawa&#x27;s force was on a decoy mission and indicated this in a blinker message to Halsey&#x27;s flagship, was similarly rebuffed. 

Commodore Arleigh Burke and Commander James H. Flatley of Mitscher&#x27;s staff had come to the same conclusion. They were sufficiently worried about the situation to wake Mitscher, who asked, &quot;Does Admiral Halsey have that report?&quot; On being told that Halsey did, Mitscher—knowing Halsey&#x27;s temperament—commented, &quot;If he wants my advice he&#x27;ll ask for it&quot; and went back to sleep.

The entire available strength of Third Fleet continued to steam northwards towards Ozawa&#x27;s decoy force, leaving the San Bernardino Strait completely unguarded. Nothing lay between the battleships of Kurita&#x27;s Center Force and the American landing vessels, except for Kinkaid&#x27;s vulnerable escort carrier group off the coast of Samar.

==Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944)==

As of 2025, the Battle of Surigao Strait was the last battleship-to-battleship action in history, one of only two battleship-versus-battleship naval battles in the Pacific campaign of World War II. (The other was the naval battle during the Guadalcanal Campaign, where sank the ). It is also the most recent battle in which one force (in this case, the U.S. Navy) was able to &quot;cross the T&quot; of its opponent. However, by the time that the battleship action was joined, the Japanese line was very ragged and consisted of only one battleship (&quot;Yamashiro&quot;), one heavy cruiser, and one destroyer, so that the &quot;crossing of the T&quot; was notional and had little effect on the outcome of the battle.

===Japanese forces===
Nishimura&#x27;s &quot;Southern Force&quot; consisted of the old battleships (flag) and , the heavy cruiser , and four destroyers, , , and . This task force left Brunei after Kurita at 15:00 on 22 October, turning eastward into the Sulu Sea and then northeasterly past the southern tip of Negros Island into the Mindanao Sea. Nishimura then proceeded northeastward with Mindanao Island to starboard and into the south entrance to the Surigao Strait, intending to exit the north entrance of the Strait into Leyte Gulf, where he would add his firepower to that of Kurita&#x27;s force.

The Japanese Second Striking Force was commanded by Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima and comprised heavy cruisers (flag) and , the light cruiser , and the destroyers , , , and .

The Japanese Southern Force was attacked by U.S. Navy bombers on 24 October but sustained only minor damage. 

Nishimura was unable to synchronize his movements with Shima and Kurita because of the strict radio silence imposed on the Center and Southern Forces. When he entered the Surigao Strait at 02:00, Shima was behind him, and Kurita was still in the Sibuyan Sea, several hours from the beaches at Leyte.

===Engagement===
As the Japanese Southern Force approached the Surigao Strait, it ran into a deadly trap set by Seventh Fleet. Rear Admiral Jesse Oldendorf had a substantial force comprising

*six battleships: , , , , , and , which carried 48 14-inch (356 mm) and 16 16-inch (406 mm) guns;
*four heavy cruisers (flagship), , , and HMAS &quot;Shropshire&quot;, which carried 35 8-inch (203 mm) guns;
*four light cruisers , , , and , which carried 54 6-inch (152 mm) guns; and
*28 destroyers and 39 motor torpedo boats (Patrol/Torpedo (PT) boats) with smaller guns and torpedoes.

Five of the six battleships had been sunk or damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequently repaired or, in the cases of &quot;California&quot; and &quot;West Virginia&quot;, rebuilt. The sole exception was &quot;Mississippi&quot;, which had been in Iceland on convoy-escort duty at that time. To pass through the narrows and reach the invasion shipping, Nishimura would have to run the gauntlet of torpedoes from the PT boats and destroyers before advancing into the concentrated fire of 14 battleships and cruisers deployed across the far mouth of the strait.

At 22:36, &quot;PT-131&quot; (Ensign Peter Gadd) was operating off Bohol when it made contact with the approaching Japanese ships. The PT boats made repeated attacks for more than three and a half hours as Nishimura&#x27;s force streamed northward. No torpedo hits were scored, but the PT boats did send contact reports which were of use to Oldendorf and his force.

Nishimura&#x27;s ships passed unscathed through the gauntlet of PT boats. However, their luck ran out a short time later, as they were subjected to devastating torpedo attacks from the American destroyers deployed on both sides of their axis of advance. At about 03:00, both Japanese battleships were hit by torpedoes. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was able to steam on, but &quot;Fusō&quot; was torpedoed by and fell out of formation, sinking forty minutes later. Two of Nishimura&#x27;s four destroyers were sunk; the destroyer &quot;Asagumo&quot; was hit and forced to retire, but later sank.

===Sinking of &quot;Fusō&quot;===
The traditional account of the sinking of &quot;Fusō&quot; was that she exploded into two halves that remained floating for some time. Samuel Morison states that the bow half of &quot;Fusō&quot; was sunk by gunfire from , and the stern half sank off Kanihaan Island; this version took into account that battleships were known sometimes to be cut into two or even three sections which could remain afloat independently. However, &quot;Fusō&quot; survivor Hideo Ogawa, interrogated in 1945, in an article on the battleship&#x27;s last voyage, stated: &quot;Shortly after 0400 the ship capsized slowly to starboard and Ogawa and others were washed away,&quot; without specifically mentioning the bisection. &quot;Fusō&quot; was hit on the starboard side by two or possibly three torpedoes. One of these started an oil fire, and as the fuel used by ships was poorly refined and easily ignited, burning patches of fuel could have led to the description from Allied observers of &quot;Fusō&quot; &quot;blowing up&quot;. Ten sailors survived the ship’s sinking and were repatriated to Japan after the war.
===Battle continues===
At 03:16, &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s radar picked up the surviving ships of Nishimura&#x27;s force at a range of . &quot;West Virginia&quot; tracked them as they approached in the pitch black night. At 03:53, she fired the eight guns of her main battery at a range of , striking &quot;Yamashiro&quot; with her first salvo. She went on to fire a total of 93 shells. At 03:55, &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Tennessee&quot; joined in, firing 63 and 69 shells, respectively, from their guns. Radar fire control allowed these American battleships to hit targets from a distance at which the Japanese battleships, with their inferior fire control systems, could not return fire.

====History&#x27;s last salvo====
The other three U.S. battleships also had difficulty as they were equipped with less advanced gunnery radar. &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; was unable to find a target and her guns remained silent. &quot;Maryland&quot; eventually succeeded in visually ranging on the splashes of the other battleships&#x27; shells, and then fired a total of 48 projectiles. only fired once in the battle-line action, a full salvo of twelve 14-inch shells. This was the last salvo ever fired by a battleship against another battleship in history, closing a significant chapter in naval warfare.

&quot;Yamashiro&quot; and &quot;Mogami&quot; were crippled by a combination of 16-inch and 14-inch armor-piercing shells, as well as the fire of Oldendorf&#x27;s flanking cruisers. The cruisers that had the latest radar equipment fired well over 2,000 rounds of armor-piercing 6-inch and 8-inch shells. &quot;Louisville&quot; (Oldendorf&#x27;s flagship) fired 37 salvos—333 rounds of 8-inch shells. The Japanese command had apparently lost grasp of the tactical picture, with all ships firing all batteries in several directions, &quot;frantically showering steel through 360°.&quot; &quot;Shigure&quot; turned and fled but lost steering and stopped dead. At 04:05 &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was struck by a torpedo fired by the destroyer , and suddenly sank at about 04:20, with Nishimura on board. &quot;Mogami&quot; and &quot;Shigure&quot; retreated southwards down the Strait. The destroyer was hit by friendly fire during the night battle, but did not sink.

The rear of the Japanese Southern Force—the &quot;Second Striking Force&quot; commanded by Vice Admiral Shima—had departed from Mako and approached Surigao Strait about astern of Nishimura. Shima&#x27;s run was initially thrown into confusion by his force nearly running aground on Panaon Island after failing to factor the outgoing tide into their approach. Japanese radar was almost useless due to excessive reflections from the many islands. The American radar was equally unable to detect ships in these conditions, especially PT boats, but &quot;PT-137&quot; hit the light cruiser &quot;Abukuma&quot; with a torpedo that crippled her and caused her to fall out of formation. Shima&#x27;s two heavy cruisers, &quot;Nachi&quot; and &quot;Ashigara&quot;, and four destroyers next encountered remnants of Nishimura&#x27;s force. Shima saw what he thought were the wrecks of both Nishimura&#x27;s battleships and ordered a retreat. His flagship &quot;Nachi&quot; collided with &quot;Mogami&quot;, flooding &quot;Mogami&quot;″s steering room and causing her to fall behind in the retreat; &quot;Mogami&quot; was further damaged by American carrier aircraft the next morning, abandoned and scuttled by a torpedo from &quot;Akebono&quot;.

===First &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks of the Pacific War===
While the Battle off Samar was raging between the Japanese surface fleet and Taffy3, Taffy1&#x27;s escort carriers were supporting the American surface ships after the Battle of Surigao Strait when daylight broke (the nighttime Surigao Strait action meant no carrier aircraft could participate until after dawn, during which the defeated Japanese southern fleet was in full retreat). As a result of Taffy1 being so far south of Samar, not many Taffy1 airplanes participated in the Battle off Samar. While in the air southwest of Leyte Gulf, the aircraft and ships of Taffy1 were immediately ordered to assist Taffy3 off of Samar but they had to return to the escort carriers to refuel and rearm. 

After the carrier aircraft returned from aerial attacks on the retreating Japanese naval forces from Surigao Strait, the Japanese launched the first pre-planned &quot;kamikaze&quot; (suicide &quot;special attack&quot; planes) attacks of World War II against Taffy1 from Davao. The escort carrier was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; first, killing 16 crewmen. A Japanese submarine also successfully launched a torpedo at &quot;Santee&quot;, striking her starboard side. Four Avenger torpedo bombers and two Wildcat fighters on &quot;Santee&quot; were destroyed in this attack. Emergency repairs saved &quot;Santee&quot; from sinking. 

The escort carrier was shortly afterwards hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;, killing 71 sailors. &quot;Suwannee&quot; was hit by another &quot;kamikaze&quot; around noon on 26 October that caused even more damage and killed 36 more crewmen. This second &quot;kamikaze&quot; strike caused a large fire that was not extinguished until nine hours later. A total of 107 sailors were killed and over 150 were wounded on &quot;Suwannee&quot; in the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks on 25–26 October. Five Avenger torpedo bombers and nine Hellcat fighters on &quot;Suwannee&quot; were destroyed.

===Results===
Of Nishimura&#x27;s seven ships, only &quot;Shigure&quot; survived long enough to escape the debacle. It was sunk by American submarine on 24 January 1945 off Kota Bharu, Malaya, with 37 dead. Shima&#x27;s ships survived the Battle of Surigao Strait, but they were sunk in further engagements around Leyte. The Southern Force provided no further threat to the Leyte landings.

==Battle off Samar (25 October 1944)==


===Prelude===
Halsey&#x27;s decision to take all the available strength of Third Fleet northwards to attack the carriers of the Japanese Northern Force had left San Bernardino Strait completely unguarded.

Senior officers in Seventh Fleet (including Kinkaid and his staff) generally assumed Halsey was taking his three available carrier groups northwards (McCain&#x27;s group, the strongest in Third Fleet, was still returning from the direction of Ulithi), but leaving the battleships of TF 34 covering the San Bernardino Strait against the Japanese Center Force. In fact, Halsey had not yet formed TF 34, and all six of Willis Lee&#x27;s battleships were on their way northwards with the carriers, as well as every available cruiser and destroyer of Third Fleet.

Kurita&#x27;s Center Force therefore emerged unopposed from San Bernardino Strait at 03:00 on 25 October and steamed southward along the coast of the island of Samar. In its path stood only Seventh Fleet&#x27;s three escort carrier units (call signs &#x27;Taffy&#x27; 1, 2, and 3), with a total of sixteen small, very slow, and unarmored escort carriers, which carried up to 28 airplanes each, protected by a screen of lightly armed and unarmored destroyers and smaller destroyer escorts (DEs). Despite the losses in the Palawan Passage and Sibuyan Sea actions, the Japanese Center Force was still very powerful, consisting of four battleships (including the giant &quot;Yamato&quot;), six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and eleven destroyers.

===Battle===
Kurita&#x27;s force caught Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague&#x27;s Task Unit 77.4.3 (&#x27;Taffy 3&#x27;) by surprise. Sprague directed his carriers to launch their planes, then ran for the cover of a rain squall to the east. He ordered the destroyers and DEs to make a smoke screen to conceal the retreating carriers.

Kurita, unaware that Ozawa&#x27;s decoy plan had succeeded, assumed he had found a carrier group from Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet. Having just redeployed his ships into anti-aircraft formation, he further complicated matters by ordering a &quot;General Attack&quot;, which called for his fleet to split into divisions and attack independently.

The destroyer was the closest to the enemy. On his own initiative, Lieutenant Commander Ernest E. Evans steered his hopelessly outclassed ship into the Japanese fleet at flank speed. &quot;Johnston&quot; fired its torpedoes at the heavy cruiser &quot;Kumano&quot;, damaging her and forcing her out of line. Seeing this, Sprague gave the order &quot;small boys attack&quot;, sending the rest of Taffy 3&#x27;s screening ships into the fray. Taffy 3&#x27;s two other destroyers, and , and the destroyer escort , attacked with suicidal determination, drawing fire and disrupting the Japanese formation as ships turned to avoid their torpedoes. As the ships approached the enemy columns, Lt. Cdr. Robert Copeland of &quot;Samuel B. Roberts&quot; told all hands via bullhorn that this would be &quot;a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival could not be expected.&quot; As the Japanese fleet continued to approach, &quot;Hoel&quot; and &quot;Roberts&quot; were hit multiple times, and quickly sank. After expending all of its torpedoes, &quot;Johnston&quot; continued to fight with its 5-inch guns, until it was sunk by a group of Japanese destroyers.

As they were preparing their aircraft for attack, the escort carriers returned the Japanese fire with all the firepower they had: one 5-inch gun per carrier. The officer in tactical command had instructed the carriers to &quot;open with pea shooters,&quot; and each ship took an enemy vessel under fire as soon as it came within range. fired on a cruiser, and is believed to have registered five hits, one amid the superstructure that caused smoke. targeted a heavy cruiser, claiming a hit on the cruiser&#x27;s No. 2 turret, with a second just below the first. sighted a cruiser, and claimed at least three hits. reported hits on multiple targets, two between the superstructure and forward stack and another on the No. 1 turret of a heavy cruiser.

Meanwhile, Rear Admiral Thomas Sprague (no relation to Clifton) ordered the sixteen escort carriers in his three task units to immediately launch all their aircraft – totaling 450 planes – equipped with whatever weapons they had available, even if these were only machine guns or depth charges. The escort carriers had planes more suited for patrol and anti-submarine duties, including older models such as the FM-2 Wildcat, although they also had the TBM Avenger torpedo bombers, in contrast to Halsey&#x27;s fleet carriers which had the newest aircraft with ample anti-shipping ordnance. However, the fact that the Japanese force had no air cover meant that Sprague&#x27;s planes could attack unopposed by Japanese fighter aircraft. Consequently, the air counterattacks were almost unceasing, and some, especially several of the strikes launched from Felix Stump&#x27;s Task Unit 77.4.2 (Taffy 2), were heavy.

The carriers of Taffy 3 turned south and retreated through the shellfire. &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;, at the rear of the American formation, became the focus of the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; and sustained multiple hits before capsizing at 09:07. Four Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers went down with &quot;Gambier Bay&quot;. Several other carriers were damaged but were able to escape.

===Admiral Kurita withdraws===
The ferocity of the American defense seemingly confirmed the Japanese assumption that they were engaging major fleet units rather than merely escort carriers and destroyers. The confusion of the &quot;General Attack&quot; order was compounded by the air and torpedo attacks, when Kurita&#x27;s flagship &quot;Yamato&quot; turned north to evade torpedoes and lost contact with the battle.

Kurita abruptly broke off the fight and gave the order &quot;all ships, my course north, speed 20&quot;, apparently to regroup his disorganized fleet. Kurita&#x27;s battle report stated he had received a message indicating a group of American carriers was steaming north of him. Preferring to expend his fleet against capital ships rather than transports, Kurita set out in pursuit and thereby lost his opportunity to destroy the shipping fleet in Leyte Gulf, and disrupt the vital landings at Leyte. After failing to intercept the carriers, which were much farther north, Kurita finally retreated towards San Bernardino Strait. Three of his heavy cruisers had been sunk, and the determined resistance had convinced him that persisting with his attack would only cause further Japanese losses.

Poor communication between the separate Japanese forces and a lack of air reconnaissance meant that Kurita was never informed that the deception had been successful, and that only a small and outgunned force stood between his battleships and the vulnerable transports of the invasion fleet. Thus, Kurita remained convinced that he had been engaging elements of Third Fleet, and it would only be a matter of time before Halsey surrounded and annihilated him. Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague wrote to his colleague Aubrey Fitch after the war, &quot;I ... stated [to Admiral Nimitz] that the main reason they turned north was that they were receiving too much damage to continue and I am still of that opinion and cold analysis will eventually confirm it.&quot;

Almost all of Kurita&#x27;s surviving force escaped. Halsey and Third Fleet&#x27;s battleships returned too late to cut him off. &quot;Nagato&quot; and &quot;Kongō&quot; had been moderately damaged by air attack from Taffy 3&#x27;s escort carriers. Kurita had begun the battle with five battleships. On their return to their bases, only &quot;Yamato&quot; and &quot;Haruna&quot; remained battleworthy.

As the desperate surface action was coming to an end, Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi put his Japanese Special Attack Units into operation from bases on Luzon, launching &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks against the Allied ships in Leyte Gulf and the escort carrier units off Samar. This was the second ever organized &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack by the Japanese in World War II after the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on Taffy1 a few hours earlier off of Surigao Strait. The escort carrier of Taffy 3 was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft and sank after a series of internal explosions. Six Grumman FM-2 Wildcat fighters and five Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers went down with &quot;St. Lo&quot;. Three other Taffy3 escort carriers, , and &quot;White Plains&quot;, were also damaged in the same &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack.

==Battle off Cape Engaño (25–26 October 1944)==


Vice-Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa&#x27;s &quot;Northern Force&quot;, built around the four aircraft carriers of the 3rd Carrier Division (—the last survivor of the six carriers that had attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941—and the light carriers , , and ), included two World War I battleships partially converted to carriers ( and —the two aft turrets had been replaced by a hangar, aircraft handling deck and catapult, but neither ship carried any aircraft in this battle), three light cruisers (, , and ), and nine destroyers. Ozawa&#x27;s carrier group was a decoy force, divested of all but 108 aircraft, intended to lure the American fleet away from protecting the transports at the landing beaches on Leyte island. Coincidentally, the name of the cape for which the battle is named, , is Spanish for .

Ozawa&#x27;s force was not located until 16:40 on 24 October, largely because Sherman&#x27;s TG38.3—the northernmost of Halsey&#x27;s groups and responsible for searches in this sector—had been preoccupied with the action in the Sibuyan Sea, and in defending itself against the Japanese air strikes from Luzon. Thus Ozawa&#x27;s group—the one Japanese force that wanted to be discovered—was the only force the Americans had not been able to find. The force that Halsey was taking north with him—three groups of Mitscher&#x27;s TF38—was overwhelmingly stronger than the Japanese Northern Force. Between them, these groups had five large fleet carriers (&quot;Intrepid&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Lexington&quot;, and &quot;Essex&quot;), five light carriers (&quot;Independence&quot;, , &quot;Langley&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot; and ), six modern battleships (, , , &quot;New Jersey&quot;, and &quot;Washington&quot;), eight cruisers (two heavy and six light), and 41 destroyers. The air groups of the ten U.S. carriers present contained 600–1,000 aircraft.

At 02:40 on 25 October, Halsey detached TF34, built around Third Fleet&#x27;s six battleships and commanded by Vice Admiral Lee. As dawn approached, the ships of Task Force 34 drew ahead of the carrier groups. Halsey intended Mitscher to make air strikes followed by the heavy gunfire of Lee&#x27;s battleships.

Around dawn on 25 October, Ozawa launched 75 aircraft, the bulk of his few aircraft, to attack Third Fleet. Most were shot down by American combat air patrols, and no damage was done to the U.S. ships. A few Japanese planes survived and made their way to land bases on Luzon.

During the night, Halsey had passed tactical command of TF38 to Admiral Mitscher, who ordered the American carrier groups to launch their first strike wave, of 180 aircraft, at dawn—before the Northern Force had been located. When the search aircraft made contact at 07:10, this strike wave was orbiting ahead of the task force. At 08:00, as the attack went in, its escorting fighters destroyed Ozawa&#x27;s combat air patrol of about 30 planes. The U.S. air strikes continued until the evening, by which time TF38 had flown 527 sorties against the Northern Force, sinking &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, the light carriers &quot;Chitose&quot; and &quot;Zuihō&quot;, and the destroyer &quot;Akizuki&quot;, all with heavy loss of life. The light carrier &quot;Chiyoda&quot; and the cruiser &quot;Tama&quot; were crippled. Ozawa transferred his flag to the light cruiser &quot;Ōyodo&quot;.

===Crisis – U.S. Seventh Fleet&#x27;s calls for help===
Shortly after 08:00 on 25 October, desperate messages calling for assistance began to come in from Seventh Fleet, which had been engaging Nishimura&#x27;s &quot;Southern Force&quot; in battle in Surigao Strait since 02:00. One message from Kinkaid, sent in plain language, read: &quot;My situation is critical. Fast battleships and support by air strikes may be able to keep enemy from destroying CVEs and entering Leyte.&quot; Halsey recalled in his memoirs that he was shocked at this message, recounting that the radio signals from Seventh Fleet had come in at random and out of order because of a backlog in the signals office. It seems that he did not receive this vital message from Kinkaid until around 10:00. Halsey later claimed he knew Kinkaid was in trouble, but he had not dreamed of the seriousness of this crisis.

One of the most alarming signals from Kinkaid reported, after their action in Surigao Strait, Seventh Fleet&#x27;s own battleships were critically low on ammunition. Even this failed to persuade Halsey to send any immediate assistance to Seventh Fleet. In fact, Seventh Fleet&#x27;s battleships were not as short of ammunition as Kinkaid&#x27;s signal implied, but Halsey did not know that.

From away in Pearl Harbor, Admiral Nimitz had been monitoring the desperate calls from Taffy3, and sent Halsey a terse message: &quot;TURKEY TROTS TO WATER GG FROM CINCPAC ACTION COM THIRD FLEET INFO COMINCH CTF SEVENTY-SEVEN X WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR RR THE WORLD WONDERS.&quot; The first four words and the last three were &quot;padding&quot; used to confuse enemy cryptanalysis (the beginning and end of the true message were marked by double consonants). The communications staff on Halsey&#x27;s flagship correctly deleted the first section of padding but mistakenly retained the last three words in the message finally handed to Halsey. The last three words—probably selected by a communications officer at Nimitz&#x27;s headquarters—may have been meant as a loose quote from Tennyson&#x27;s poem on &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, suggested by the coincidence that this day, 25 October, was the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Balaclava—and was not intended as a commentary on the current crisis off Leyte. Halsey, however, when reading the message, thought that the last words—&quot;THE WORLD WONDERS&quot;—were a biting piece of criticism from Nimitz, threw his cap to the deck and broke into &quot;sobs of rage&quot;. Rear Admiral Robert Carney, his chief of staff, confronted him, telling Halsey &quot;Stop it! What the hell&#x27;s the matter with you? Pull yourself together.&quot;

Eventually, at 11:15, more than three hours after the first distress messages from Seventh Fleet had been received by his flagship, Halsey ordered TF34 to turn around and head southwards towards Samar. At this point, Lee&#x27;s battleships were almost within gun range of Ozawa&#x27;s force. Two and a half hours were then spent refuelling TF34&#x27;s accompanying destroyers.

After this succession of delays, it was too late for TF34 to give any practical help to Seventh Fleet, other than to assist in picking up survivors from Taffy3, and too late even to intercept Kurita&#x27;s force before it made its escape through San Bernardino Strait.

Nevertheless, at 16:22, in a desperate and even more belated attempt to intervene in the events off Samar, Halsey formed a new task group—TG34.5—under Rear Admiral Oscar C. Badger II, built around Third Fleet&#x27;s two fastest battleships—&quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;, both capable of a speed of more than —and TF34&#x27;s three cruisers and eight destroyers, and sped southwards, leaving Lee and the other four battleships to follow. As Morison observes, if Badger&#x27;s group had succeeded in intercepting the Japanese Center Force, it may have been outgunned by Kurita&#x27;s battleships.

Cruisers and destroyers of TG34.5, however, caught the —the last straggler from Center Force—off San Bernardino Strait, and sank her with all hands, including the survivors from &quot;Chikuma&quot;.

===Final actions===
When Halsey turned TF34 southwards at 11:15, he detached a task group of four of its cruisers and nine of its destroyers under Rear Admiral DuBose, and reassigned this group to TF38. At 14:15, Mitscher ordered DuBose to pursue the remnants of the Japanese Northern Force. His cruisers finished off the light carrier &quot;Chiyoda&quot; at around 17:00, and at 20:59 his ships sank the destroyer &quot;Hatsuzuki&quot; after a very stubborn fight.

When Ozawa learned of the deployment of DuBose&#x27;s relatively weak task group, he ordered battleships &quot;Ise&quot; and &quot;Hyūga&quot; to turn southwards and attack it, but they failed to locate DuBose&#x27;s group, which they heavily outgunned. Halsey&#x27;s withdrawal of all six of Lee&#x27;s battleships in his attempt to assist Seventh Fleet had now rendered TF38 vulnerable to a surface counterattack by the decoy Northern Force.

At about 23:10, the American submarine torpedoed and sank the light cruiser &quot;Tama&quot; of Ozawa&#x27;s force. This was the last act of the Battle off Cape Engaño, and—apart from some final air strikes on the retreating Japanese forces on 26 October—the conclusion of the Battle for Leyte Gulf.

==Weighing the decisions of Halsey==

===Criticism===
Halsey was questioned for his decision to take TF 34 north in pursuit of Ozawa, and for failing to detach it when Kinkaid first appealed for help. A piece of U.S. Navy slang for Halsey&#x27;s actions is &quot;Bull&#x27;s Run&quot;, a phrase combining Halsey&#x27;s newspaper nickname &quot;Bull&quot; (he was known as &quot;Bill&quot; Halsey) with an allusion to the Battle of Bull Run in the American Civil War, which Union troops lost due to poor organization and lack of decisive action.

Clifton Sprague—commander of Task Unit 77.4.3 in the Battle off Samar—was later bitterly critical of Halsey&#x27;s decision, and of his failure to clearly inform Kinkaid and Seventh Fleet that their northern flank was no longer protected: &quot;In the absence of any information ... it was logical to assume that our northern flank could not be exposed without ample warning.&quot; Regarding Halsey&#x27;s failure to turn TF 34 southwards when Seventh Fleet&#x27;s first calls for assistance off Samar were received, Morison writes:
Vice Admiral Lee said in his action report as Commander of TF 34: &quot;No battle damage was incurred nor inflicted on the enemy by vessels while operating as Task Force Thirty-Four.&quot;

===Halsey&#x27;s defense===
In his dispatch after the battle, Halsey justified the decision to go North as follows:
Halsey also argued that he had feared leaving TF 34 to defend the strait without carrier support as that would have left it vulnerable to attack from land-based aircraft, while leaving one of the fast carrier groups behind to cover the battleships would have significantly reduced the concentration of air power going north to strike Ozawa.

However, Morison states that Admiral Lee said after the battle that he would have been fully prepared for the battleships to cover the San Bernardino Strait without air cover, as each of the escort carriers of TF 77 had up to 28 planes on them, but little surface ship protection, from Kurita&#x27;s traditional naval force, which lacked air support.

===Potential mitigating factors===
The fact that Halsey was aboard one of the two fast battleships (&quot;New Jersey&quot;), and &quot;would have had to remain behind&quot; with TF 34 while the bulk of his fleet charged northwards, may have influenced his decision, but it would have been perfectly feasible to have taken one or both of Third Fleet&#x27;s two fastest battleships with some or all of the large carriers in the pursuit of Ozawa, while leaving the rest of the battle line off the San Bernardino Strait. Halsey&#x27;s original plan for TF 34 was for four, not all six, of Third Fleet&#x27;s battleships.

Halsey was certainly philosophically against dividing his forces. He believed strongly in the current naval doctrine of force concentration, as indicated by his writings both before World War II and in his subsequent articles and interviews defending his actions. In addition, Halsey may well have been influenced by the recent criticisms of Admiral Raymond Spruance, who was criticized for excessive caution in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, allowing the bulk of the Japanese fleet to escape. Halsey&#x27;s chief of staff, Rear Admiral Robert &quot;Mick&quot; Carney, was also wholeheartedly in favor of taking all of Third Fleet&#x27;s available forces northwards to attack the Japanese carriers.

Halsey also did not believe reports of just how badly compromised Japan&#x27;s naval air power was, and had no idea that Ozawa&#x27;s decoy force only had 100 aircraft. Although in a letter to Nimitz just three days before the Battle off Samar, Halsey wrote that Mitscher believed &quot;Jap naval air was wiped out&quot;, which Spruance and Mitscher concluded from shooting down over 433 carrier based planes at the Marianas Turkey Shoot, Halsey ignored Mitscher&#x27;s insights, and later stated that he did not want to be &quot;shuttle bombed&quot; (whereby attacking planes from Ozawa&#x27;s force could refuel and rearm at bases on land, allowing them to attack again on the return flight), or to give them a &quot;free shot&quot; at the U.S. forces in Leyte Gulf.

Halsey may have considered Kurita&#x27;s damaged battleships and cruisers, lacking carrier support, as little threat, but ironically, through his own failures to adequately communicate his intentions, he managed to demonstrate that unsupported battleships could still be dangerous.

In his master&#x27;s thesis submitted at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Lieutenant Commander Kent Coleman argues that the division of command hierarchies of Third Fleet, under Halsey reporting to Nimitz, and Seventh Fleet, under Kinkaid reporting to General MacArthur, was the primary contributor to the near-success of Kurita&#x27;s attack. Coleman concludes that &quot;the divided U.S. naval chain of command amplified problems in communication and coordination between Halsey and Kinkaid. This divided command was more important in determining the course of the battle than the tactical decision made by Halsey and led to an American disunity of effort that nearly allowed Kurita&#x27;s mission to succeed.&quot;

==Losses==
Due to the long duration and size of the battle, accounts vary as to the losses that occurred as a part of the Battle of Leyte Gulf and losses that occurred shortly before and shortly after. One account of the losses, by Samuel E. Morison, lists the following vessels:

===Allied losses===
The United States lost at least 11 warships during the Battle of Leyte Gulf:

*One light aircraft carrier: 
*Two escort carriers: and (the first major warship sunk by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack)
*Two destroyers: and 
*One destroyer escort: 
*One PT boat: &quot;USS PT-493&quot;
*Four other ships (including submarine ), along with , were damaged.
More than 1,600 sailors and aircrewmen of the Allied escort carrier units were killed. The losses in the Battle of Leyte Gulf were not evenly distributed throughout all forces. Very minimal Allied casualties occurred at the overwhelming Allied victories at the Battle of Surigao Strait and the Battle off Cape Engaño. At the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea the Japanese attack on the light aircraft carrier &quot;Princeton&quot; led to the loss of 108 killed on &quot;Princeton&quot; and 241 killed and 412 wounded on the light cruiser &quot;Birmingham&quot; due to secondary explosions on &quot;Princeton&quot; that caused severe damage on &quot;Birmingham&quot;. 123 troops were killed and over 150 were wounded in the first pre-planned &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks of World War II on Taffy1&#x27;s aircraft carriers near Surigao Strait. At the mismatched Battle off Samar alone 5 of the 7 ships of the combined actions were lost along with 23 aircraft lost and 1,161 killed and missing and 913 wounded, comparable to the combined losses at the Battle of Midway and Battle of Coral Sea. The destroyer &quot;Heermann&quot;, despite her unequal fight with the enemy, finished the battle with only six of her crew dead. As a result of communication errors and other failures, a large number of survivors from Taffy 3 were unable to be rescued for several days, and died unnecessarily as a consequence. HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; suffered 30 officers and sailors dead, and another 62 servicemen wounded in a kamikaze-like attack on 21 October 1944, at the start of the battle. At the Battle of Surigao Strait 39 U.S. troops were killed, 114 were wounded and one PT boat (USS &quot;PT-493&quot;) was sunk.

On 24–25 October, in two American submarine battles that were related to Japanese naval convoys involved in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, two U.S. submarines were lost in actions that led to the deaths of 1,938 U.S. troops. sank numerous ships in a large Japanese convoy that was on the way to reinforce Japanese troops in Leyte and Leyte Gulf. &quot;Tang&quot; then accidentally sank herself in a circular run on the very last torpedo that she had in her arsenal. 78 men were killed while 9 survived and were captured by the Japanese. sank the unmarked hell ship , which was transporting American prisoners of war (POWs) from the Philippines to Formosa as a response to the Formosa Air Battle and the imminent invasion of the Philippines. 1,773 POWs died due to the rest of the Japanese convoy refusing to rescue them. This was the largest loss of life of U.S. troops at sea in history. &quot;Shark&quot; was sunk immediately by Japanese escort ships. All 87 crewmen on &quot;Shark&quot; died.

===Japanese losses===
The Japanese lost 26 warships during the Battle of Leyte Gulf:
*One fleet aircraft carrier: (flagship of the decoy Northern Forces and last of the original attacking Pearl Harbor carriers still afloat).
*Three light aircraft carriers: , , and .
*Three battleships: (former flagship of the Japanese Combined Fleet), (flagship of the Southern Force) and .
*Six heavy cruisers: (flagship of the Center Force), , , , , and .
*Four light cruisers: , , , and .
*Nine destroyers: , , , , , , , , and .

Listed Japanese losses include only those ships sunk in the battle. After the nominal end of the battle, several damaged ships were faced with the option of either making their way to Singapore, close to Japan&#x27;s oil supplies but where comprehensive repairs could not be undertaken, or making their way back to Japan, where there were better repair facilities but scant oil. The &quot;Nachi&quot; was lost to aerial attack while under repair at Manila Bay. The cruiser &quot;Kumano&quot; and battleship &quot;Kongō&quot; were sunk retreating to Japan. Cruisers &quot;Takao&quot; and &quot;Myōkō&quot; were stranded, unrepairable, in Singapore. Many of the other survivors of the battle were bombed and sunk at anchor in Japan, unable to move without fuel.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Leyte Gulf secured the beachheads of the U.S. Sixth Army on Leyte against attack from the sea. However, much hard fighting would be required before the island was completely in Allied hands at the end of December 1944: the Battle of Leyte on land was fought in parallel with an air and sea campaign in which the Japanese reinforced and resupplied their troops on Leyte while the Allies attempted to interdict them and establish air-sea superiority for a series of amphibious landings in Ormoc Bay—engagements collectively referred to as the Battle of Ormoc Bay.

The Imperial Japanese Navy had suffered its greatest loss of ships and crew ever. Its failure to dislodge the Allied invaders from Leyte meant the inevitable loss of the Philippines, which in turn meant Japan would be all but cut off from its occupied territories in Southeast Asia. These territories provided resources that were vital to Japan, in particular the oil needed for her ships and aircraft. This problem was compounded because the shipyards and sources of manufactured goods, such as ammunition, were in Japan itself. Finally, the loss of Leyte opened the way for the invasion of the Ryukyu Islands in 1945.

The major surface ships returned to their bases to languish, entirely or almost entirely inactive, for the remainder of the war. The only major operation by these surface ships between the Battle for Leyte Gulf and the Japanese surrender was the suicidal sortie in April 1945 (part of Operation Ten-Go), in which the battleship &quot;Yamato&quot; and her escorts were destroyed by American carrier aircraft.

The first use of &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft took place following the Leyte landings. A &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit the Australian heavy cruiser HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; on 21 October. Organized suicide attacks by the &quot;Special Attack Force&quot; (Japanese Special Attack Units) began on 25 October during the closing phase of the Battle off Samar, causing the destruction of the escort carrier &quot;St. Lo&quot;.

J. F. C. Fuller writes of the outcome of Leyte Gulf:
==Memorials==

*At the U.S. Naval Academy, in Alumni Hall, a concourse is dedicated to Lt. Lloyd Garnett and his shipmates on , who earned their ship the reputation as the &quot;destroyer escort that fought like a battleship&quot; in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.
*The &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carrier was named for the battle.
*The &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruiser is named for the battle.
*The &quot;Dealey&quot;-class destroyer escort was named in honor of Lt. Cmdr. Ernest E. Evans, commanding officer of the .
*At Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California, several monuments are dedicated to Taffy 3 and the sailors lost during and after the Battle off Samar
*The Battle of Surigao Strait Memorial, in Surigao City overlooking the strait, was opened by city government and private partners on the 75th anniversary of the battle, October 25, 2019.

<doc id="189105" wikidata="Q848485" url="?curid=189105" title="Roche lobe">
<text>In astronomy, the Roche lobe is the region around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star. It is an approximately teardrop-shaped region bounded by a critical gravitational equipotential, with the apex of the teardrop pointing towards the other star (the apex is at the Lagrangian point of the system).

The Roche lobe is different from the Roche sphere, which approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of one astronomical body in the face of perturbations from a more massive body around which it orbits. It is also different from the Roche limit, which is the distance at which an object held together only by gravity begins to break up due to tidal forces. The Roche lobe, Roche limit, and Roche sphere are named after the French astronomer Édouard Roche.

==Definition==
In a binary system with a circular orbit, it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that rotates along with the objects. In this non-inertial frame, one must consider centrifugal force in addition to gravity. The two together can be described by a potential, so that, for example, the stellar surfaces lie along equipotential surfaces.

Close to each star, surfaces of equal gravitational potential are approximately spherical and concentric with the nearer star. Far from the stellar system, the equipotentials are approximately ellipsoidal and elongated parallel to the axis joining the stellar centers. A critical equipotential intersects itself at the Lagrangian point of the system, forming a two-lobed figure-of-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe. This critical equipotential defines the Roche lobes.

Where matter moves relative to the co-rotating frame it will seem to be acted upon by a Coriolis force. This is not derivable from the Roche lobe model as the Coriolis force is a non-conservative force (i.e. not representable by a scalar potential).

==Further analysis==

In the gravity potential graphics, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5 are in synchronous rotation with the system. Regions of red, orange, yellow, green, light blue and blue are potential arrays from high to low. Red arrows are rotation of the system and black arrows are relative motions of the debris.

Debris goes faster in the lower potential region and slower in the higher potential region. So, relative motions of the debris in the lower orbit are in the same direction with the system revolution while opposite in the higher orbit.

L1 is the gravitational capture equilibrium point. It is a gravity cut-off point of the binary star system. It is the minimum potential equilibrium among L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5. It is the easiest way for the debris to commute between a Hill sphere (an inner circle of blue and light blue) and communal gravity regions (figure-eights of yellow and green in the inner side).
L2 and L3 are gravitational perturbation equilibria points. Passing through these two equilibrium points, debris can commute between the external region (figure-eights of yellow and green in the outer side) and the communal gravity region of the binary system.

L4 and L5 are the maximum potential points in the system. They are unstable equilibria. If the mass ratio of the two stars becomes larger, then the orange, yellow and green regions will become a horseshoe orbit.

The red region will become the tadpole orbit.

==Mass transfer==
When a star &quot;exceeds its Roche lobe&quot;, its surface extends out beyond its Roche lobe and the material which lies outside the Roche lobe can &quot;fall off&quot; into the other object&#x27;s Roche lobe via the first Lagrangian point. In binary evolution this is referred to as &quot;mass transfer&quot; via &quot;Roche-lobe overflow&quot;.

In principle, mass transfer could lead to the total disintegration of the object, since a reduction of the object&#x27;s mass causes its Roche lobe to shrink. However, there are several reasons why this does not happen in general. First, a reduction of the mass of the donor star may cause the donor star to shrink as well, possibly preventing such an outcome. Second, with the transfer of mass between the two binary components, angular momentum is transferred as well.
While mass transfer from a more massive donor to a less massive accretor generally leads to a shrinking orbit, the reverse causes the orbit to expand (under the assumption of mass and angular-momentum conservation). The expansion of the binary orbit will lead to a less dramatic shrinkage or even expansion of the donor&#x27;s Roche lobe, often preventing the destruction of the donor.

To determine the stability of the mass transfer and hence exact fate of the donor star, one needs to take into account how the radius of the donor star and that of its Roche lobe react to the mass loss from the donor; if the star expands faster than its Roche lobe or shrinks less rapidly than its Roche lobe for a prolonged time, mass transfer will be unstable and the donor star may disintegrate. If the donor star expands less rapidly or shrinks faster than its Roche lobe, mass transfer will generally be stable and may continue for a long time.

Mass transfer due to Roche-lobe overflow is responsible for a number of astronomical phenomena, including Algol systems, recurring novae (binary stars consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf that are sufficiently close that material from the red giant dribbles down onto the white dwarf), X-ray binaries and millisecond pulsars. Such mass transfer by Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) is further broken down into three distinct cases:

;Case A
:Case A RLOF occurs when the donor star is hydrogen burning. According to Nelson and Eggleton, there are a number of subclasses which are reproduced here:
;AD &quot;dynamic&quot;
:when RLOF happens to a star with a deep convection zone. Mass transfer happens rapidly on the dynamical time scale of the star and may end with a complete merger.
;AR &quot;rapid contact&quot;
:similar to AD, but as the star onto which matter is rapidly accreting gains mass, it gains physical size enough for it to reach its own Roche-lobe. As such times, the system manifests as a contact binary such as a W Ursae Majoris variable.
;AS &quot;slow contact&quot;
:similar to AR, but only a short period of fast mass transfer happens followed by a much longer period of slow mass transfer. Eventually the stars will come into contact, but they have changed substantially by the point this happens. Algol variables are the result of such situations.
;AE &quot;early overtaking&quot;
:similar to AS, but the star gaining mass overtakes the star donating mass to evolve past the main sequence. The donor star can shrink so small to stop mass transfer, but eventually mass transfer will start again as stellar evolution continues leading to the cases
;AL &quot;late overtaking&quot;
:the case when the star that initially was the donor undergoes a supernova after the other star has undergone its own round of RLOF.
;AB &quot;binary&quot;
:the case where the stars switch back and forth between which one is undergoing RLOF at least three times (technically a subclass of the above).
;AN &quot;no overtaking&quot;
:the case when the star that initially was the donor undergoes a supernova before the other star reaches a RLOF phase.
;AG &quot;giant&quot;
:Mass transfer does not begin until the star reaches the red giant branch but before it has exhausted its hydrogen core (after which the system is described as Case B).
;Case B
:Case B happens when RLOF starts while the donor is a post-core hydrogen burning/hydrogen shell burning star. This case can be further subdivided into classes Br and Bc according to whether the mass transfer occurs from a star dominated by a radiation zone (Br) and therefore evolves as the situation with most Case A RLOF or a convective zone (Bc) after which a common envelope phase may occur (similar to Case C). An alternative division of cases is Ba, Bb, and Bc which are roughly corresponding to RLOF phases that happen during helium fusion, after helium fusion but before carbon fusion, or after carbon fusion in the highly evolved star.
;Case C
:Case C happens when RLOF starts when the donor is at or beyond the helium shell burning phase. These systems are the rarest observed, but this may be due to selection bias.

==Geometry==
The precise shape of the Roche lobe depends on the mass ratio formula_1, and must be evaluated numerically. However, for many purposes it is useful to approximate the Roche lobe as a sphere of the same volume. An approximate formula for the radius of this sphere is

where formula_2 and formula_3.
Function formula_4 is greater than formula_5 for formula_6. The length &quot;A&quot; is the orbital separation of the system and &quot;r&quot; is the radius of the sphere whose volume approximates the Roche lobe of mass &quot;M&quot;. This formula is accurate to within about 2%. Another approximate formula was proposed by Eggleton and reads as follows:

{0.6q^{2/3} + \ln(1 + q^{1/3})}&lt;/math&gt;.}}

This formula gives results up to 1% accuracy over the entire range of the mass ratio formula_7.

<doc id="189109" wikidata="Q2301077" url="?curid=189109" title="Spanish language in the United States">
<text>Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States. Over 43.4 million people aged five or older speak Spanish at home (13.7%). Spanish is also the most learned language other than English, with about 8 million students. Estimates count up to 58.9 million native speakers, heritage language speakers, and second-language speakers. There is an Academy of the Spanish Language located in the United States as well.

In the United States there are more speakers of Spanish than speakers of French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Hawaiian, the Indo-Aryan languages, the various varieties of Chinese, Arabic and the Native American languages combined. According to the 2023 American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, Spanish is spoken at home by 43.4 million people aged five or older, more than twice as many as in 1990.

Spanish has been spoken in what is now the United States since the 15th century, with the arrival of Spanish colonization in North America. Colonizers settled in areas that would later become Florida, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California as well as in what is now the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Spanish explorers explored areas of 42 of the future US states leaving behind a varying range of Hispanic legacy in North America. Western regions of the Louisiana Territory were also under Spanish rule between 1763 and 1800, after the French and Indian War, which further extended Spanish influences throughout what is now the United States.

After the incorporation of those areas into the United States in the first half of the 19th century, Spanish was later reinforced in the country by the acquisition of Puerto Rico in 1898. Waves of immigration from Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, El Salvador, and elsewhere in Latin America have strengthened the prominence of Spanish in the country. Today, Hispanics are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, which has increased the use and importance of Spanish in the United States. Although, there is a decline in the share use of Spanish among Hispanics in major cities of the United States, there is an annual increase of the total number of Spanish speakers and the use of Spanish at home.

==History==

===Early Spanish settlements===
The Spanish arrived in what would later become the United States in 1493, with the Spanish arrival to Puerto Rico. Ponce de León explored Florida in 1513. In 1565, the Spaniards founded St. Augustine, Florida. The Spanish later left but others moved in and it is the oldest continuously occupied European settlement in the continental United States. Juan Ponce de León founded San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1508. Historically, the Spanish-speaking population increased because of territorial annexation of lands claimed earlier by the Spanish Empire and by wars with Mexico and by land purchases.

=== Spanish Louisiana ===

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, land claimed by Spain encompassed a large part of the contemporary U.S. territory, including the French colony of Louisiana from 1769 to 1800. In order to further establish and defend Louisiana, Spanish Governor Bernardo de Gálvez recruited Canary Islanders to emigrate to North America. Between November 1778 and July 1779, around 1600 Isleños arrived in New Orleans, and another group of about 300 came in 1783. By 1780, the four Isleño communities were already founded. When Louisiana was sold to the United States, its Spanish, Creole and Cajun inhabitants became U.S. citizens, and continued to speak Spanish or French. In 1813, George Ticknor started a program of Spanish Studies at Harvard University.
Spain also founded settlements along the Sabine River, to protect the border with French Louisiana. The towns of Nacogdoches, Texas and Los Adaes were founded as part of this settlement, and the people there spoke a dialect descended from rural Mexican Spanish, which is now almost completely extinct.
Although it&#x27;s commonly thought in Nacogdoches that the Hispanic residents of the Sabine River area are ,
their Spanish dialect is derived from rural Mexican Spanish, and their ancestors came from Mexico and other parts of Texas.

===Annexation of Texas and the Mexican–American War===
In 1821, after Mexico&#x27;s War of Independence from Spain, Texas was part of the United Mexican States as the state of Coahuila y Tejas. A large influx of Americans soon followed, originally with the approval of Mexico&#x27;s president. In 1836, the now largely &quot;American&quot; Texans fought a war of independence from the central government of Mexico. The arrivals from the US objected to Mexico&#x27;s abolition of slavery. They declared independence and established the Republic of Texas. In 1846, the Republic dissolved when Texas entered the United States of America as a state. By 1850, fewer than 16,000 or 7.5% of Texans were of Mexican descent, Spanish-speaking people (both Mexicans and non-Spanish European settlers, including German Texans) were outnumbered six to one by English-speaking settlers (both Americans and other immigrant Europeans).

After the Mexican War of Independence from Spain, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, western Colorado and southwestern Wyoming also became part of the Mexican territory of Alta California. Most of New Mexico, western Texas, southern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and the Oklahoma panhandle were part of the territory of Santa Fe de Nuevo México. The geographical isolation and unique political history of this territory led to New Mexican Spanish differing notably from both Spanish spoken in other parts of the United States of America and Spanish spoken in the present-day United Mexican States.

Mexico lost almost half of the northern territory gained from Spain in 1821 to the United States in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). This included parts of contemporary Texas, and Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, California, Nevada, and Utah. Although the lost territory was sparsely populated, the thousands of Spanish-speaking Mexicans subsequently became U.S. citizens. The war-ending Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) does not explicitly address language. Although Spanish initially continued to be used in schools and government, the English-speaking American settlers who entered the Southwest established their language, culture, and law as dominant, displacing Spanish in the public sphere.

The California experience is illustrative. The first California constitutional convention in 1849 had eight Californio participants; the resulting state constitution was produced in English and Spanish, and it contained a clause requiring all published laws and regulations to be published in both languages. One of the first acts of the first California Legislature of 1850 was to authorize the appointment of a State Translator, who would be responsible for translating all state laws, decrees, documents, or orders into Spanish.

Such magnanimity did not last very long. As early as February 1850, California adopted the Anglo-American common law as the basis of the new state&#x27;s legal system. In 1855, California declared that English would be the only medium of instruction in its schools. These policies were one way of ensuring the social and political dominance of Anglos.

The state&#x27;s second constitutional convention in 1872 had &quot;no&quot; Spanish-speaking participants; the convention&#x27;s English-speaking participants felt that the state&#x27;s remaining minority of Spanish-speakers should simply learn English; and the convention ultimately voted 46–39 to revise the earlier clause so that all official proceedings would henceforth be published only in English.

Despite the displacement of Spanish from the public sphere, much of the border region, including most of Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, and south Texas, was home to Spanish speaking communities until at least the beginning of the 20th century.

===Spanish–American War (1898)===

In 1898, consequent to the Spanish–American War, the United States took control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines as American territories. In 1902, Cuba became independent from the United States, while Puerto Rico remained a U.S. territory. The American government required government services to be bilingual in Spanish and English, and attempted to introduce English-medium education to Puerto Rico, but the latter effort was unsuccessful.

Once Puerto Rico was granted autonomy in 1948, even mainlander officials who came to Puerto Rico were forced to learn Spanish. Only 20% of Puerto Rico&#x27;s residents understand English, and although the island&#x27;s government had a policy of official bilingualism, it was repealed in favor of a Spanish-only policy in 1991. This policy was reversed in 1993 when a pro-statehood party ousted a pro-independence party from the commonwealth government.

===Hispanics as the largest minority in the United States===
The relatively recent but large influx of Spanish-speakers to the United States has increased the overall total of Spanish-speakers in the country. They form majorities and large minorities in many political districts, especially in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas (the American states bordering Mexico), and also in South Florida.

Mexicans first moved to the United States as refugees in the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1917, but many more emigrated later for economic reasons. The large majority of Mexicans are in the former Mexican-controlled areas in the Southwest. From 1942 to 1962, the Bracero program would provide for mass Mexican migration to the United States.

At over 5 million, Puerto Ricans are easily the second largest Hispanic group. Of all major Hispanic groups, Puerto Ricans are the least likely to be proficient in Spanish, but millions of Puerto Rican Americans living in the U.S. mainland are fluent in Spanish. Puerto Ricans are natural-born U.S. citizens, and many Puerto Ricans have migrated to New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, and other areas of the Eastern United States, increasing the Spanish-speaking populations and in some areas being the majority of the Hispanophone population, especially in Central Florida. In Hawaii, where Puerto Rican farm laborers and Mexican ranchers have settled since the late 19th century, seven percent of the islands&#x27; people are either Hispanic or Hispanophone or both.

The Cuban Revolution of 1959 created a community of Cuban exiles who opposed the Communist revolution, many of whom left for the United States. In 1963, the Ford Foundation established the first bilingual education program in the United States for the children of Cuban exiles in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 boosted immigration from Latin American countries, and in 1968, Congress passed the Bilingual Education Act. Most of these one million Cuban Americans settled in southern and central Florida, while other Cubans live in the Northeastern United States; most are fluent in Spanish. In the city of Miami today Spanish is the first language mostly due to Cuban immigration. Likewise, the Nicaraguan Revolution and subsequent Contra War created a migration of Nicaraguans fleeing the Sandinista government and civil war to the United States in the late 1980s. Most of these Nicaraguans migrated to Florida and California.

The exodus of Salvadorans was a result of both economic and political problems. The largest immigration wave occurred as a result of the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s, in which 20 to 30 percent of El Salvador&#x27;s population emigrated. About 50 percent, or up to 500,000 of those who escaped, headed to the United States, which was already home to over 10,000 Salvadorans, making Salvadoran Americans the fourth-largest Hispanic and Latino American group, after the Mexican-American majority, stateside Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.

As civil wars engulfed several Central American countries in the 1980s, hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans fled their country and came to the United States. Between 1980 and 1990, the Salvadoran immigrant population in the United States increased nearly fivefold from 94,000 to 465,000. The number of Salvadoran immigrants in the United States continued to grow in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of family reunification and new arrivals fleeing a series of natural disasters that hit El Salvador, including earthquakes and hurricanes. By 2008, there were about 1.1 million Salvadoran immigrants in the United States.

Until the 20th century, there was no clear record of the number of Venezuelans who emigrated to the United States. Between the 18th and early 19th centuries, there were many European immigrants who went to Venezuela, only to later migrate to the United States along with their children and grandchildren who were born and/or grew up in Venezuela speaking Spanish. From 1910 to 1930, it is estimated that over 4,000 South Americans each year emigrated to the United States; however, there are few specific figures indicating these statistics. Many Venezuelans settled in the United States with hopes of receiving a better education, only to remain there following graduation. They are frequently joined by relatives. However, since the early 1980s, the reasons for Venezuelan emigration have changed to include hopes of earning a higher salary and due to the economic fluctuations in Venezuela which also promoted an important migration of Venezuelan professionals to the US. In the 2000s, dissident Venezuelans migrated to South Florida, especially the suburbs of Doral and Weston. Other main states with Venezuelan American populations are, according to the 1990 census, New York, California, Texas (adding to their existing Hispanic populations), New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland.

Refugees from Spain also migrated to the U.S. due to the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and political instability under the regime of Francisco Franco that lasted until 1975. The majority of Spaniards settled in Florida, Texas, California, New Jersey, New York City, Chicago, and Puerto Rico.

The publication of data by the United States Census Bureau in 2003 revealed that Hispanics were the largest minority in the United States and caused a flurry of press speculation in Spain about the position of Spanish in the United States. That year, the Instituto Cervantes, an organization created by the Spanish government in 1991 to promote Spanish language around the globe, established a branch in New York.

==Historical demographics==


In total, there were 36,995,602 people aged five or older in the United States who spoke Spanish at home (12.8% of the total U.S. population) according to the 2010 census.

==Current status==


Although the United States has no &quot;de jure&quot; official language, English is the dominant language of business, education, government, religion, media, culture, and the public sphere. Virtually all state and federal government agencies as well as large corporations use English as their internal working language, especially at the management level. Some states, such as Arizona, California, Florida, New Mexico, and Texas provide bilingual legislative notices and official documents in Spanish and English and in other commonly used languages. English is the primary language of most Americans, including a growing proportion of Hispanics. 

Between 2000 and 2015, the proportion of Hispanics who spoke Spanish at home decreased from 78 to 73 percent. As noted above, the only major exception was the territory of Puerto Rico, where Spanish was proclaimed the first official language. In Puerto Rico, it is the most commonly used language, the language of local governments, and the language of instruction in schools and universities.

Spanish is the most widely taught second language in the United States.

Possibly at least partially as a result of a language barrier, children from Spanish-speaking households in the United States experience 50% higher rates of obesity than those in English-speaking households, according to the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Families may not have access to health education materials or resources in Spanish, and food labels are typically in English only.

===California===

California&#x27;s first constitution recognized Spanish-language rights:

By 1870, English-speakers were a majority in California; in 1879, the state promulgated a new constitution with a clause under which all official proceedings were to be conducted exclusively in English, which remained in effect until 1966. In 1986, California voters added a new constitutional clause by referendum:

Spanish remains widely spoken throughout the state, and many government forms, documents, and services are bilingual in English and Spanish. Although all official proceedings are to be conducted in English, the California courts system offers accommodations to Spanish speakers:

===Arizona===
Throughout the history of the American Southwest, the controversial issue of language as part of cultural rights and bilingual state government representation has caused sociocultural friction between Anglophones and Hispanophones. The State of Arizona, like its neighbors in the Southwest, has had close linguistic and cultural ties with Mexico. The state, except for the 1853 Gadsden Purchase, was part of the New Mexico Territory until 1863, when the western half was made into Arizona Territory. The area of the former Gadsden Purchase was largely Spanish-speaking until the 1940s, although the Tucson area had a higher ratio of Anglophones (including Mexican Americans who were fluent in English). The continuous arrival of Mexican settlers increased the number of Spanish speakers.

===Florida===

During the 1990s and 2000s, Miami emerged as a global city with a majority Hispanic bilingual population. Today, most of the residents of the Miami metropolitan area speak Spanish at home, and the influence of Spanish can even be seen in many features of the local dialect of English. Miami is considered the &quot;capital of Latin US&quot; for its many bilingual corporations, banks, and media outlets that cater to international business. 

In addition, there are several other major cities in Florida with a sizable percentage of the population able to speak Spanish, most notably Tampa (18%) and Orlando (16.6%). Ybor City, a historic neighborhood near downtown Tampa, was founded and is populated chiefly by Spanish and Cuban immigrants. 
Most Latinos in Florida are of Cuban descent and live in metropolitan Miami, followed by those of Puerto Rican origin in Miami and Orlando, and Mexican origin in Tampa, Fort Myers and Naples.

===New Mexico===

New Mexico is commonly thought to have Spanish as an official language alongside English because of its wide usage and legal promotion of Spanish in the state; however, the state has no official language. New Mexico&#x27;s laws are promulgated in both Spanish and English. English is the state government&#x27;s paper working language, but government business is often conducted in Spanish, particularly at the local level. Spanish has been spoken in New Mexico since the 16th century.

Because of its relative isolation from other Spanish-speaking areas over most of its 400-year existence, New Mexico Spanish, particularly the Spanish of northern New Mexico and Colorado has retained many elements of 16th- and 17th-century Spanish lost in other varieties and has developed its own vocabulary. In addition, it contains many words from Nahuatl, the language that is still spoken by the Nahua people in Mexico. New Mexican Spanish also contains loanwords from the Pueblo languages of the upper Rio Grande Valley, Mexican-Spanish words (&quot;mexicanismos&quot;), and borrowings from English. Grammatical changes include the loss of the second-person plural verb form, changes in verb endings, particularly in the preterite, and the partial merger of the second and third conjugations.

===Texas===
In Texas, English is the state&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; official language and is used in government, although it lacks &quot;de jure&quot; status. However, the longstanding presence of Spanish Speaking Texans (see: Tejanos and Mexican Americans), in addition to the ebb and flow of Spanish-speaking people across the border since the Texas Revolution, has resulted in large significance of Spanish as a minority language in Texas. Texas&#x27;s counties close to the Mexican border are mostly Hispanic and so Spanish is commonly spoken in the region. The Texas government, in Section 2054.116 of the Government Code, mandates providing by state agencies of information on their websites in Spanish to assist residents who have limited English proficiency.

=== Kansas ===
Spanish has been spoken in the state of Kansas since at least the early 1900s, primarily because of several waves of immigration from Mexico. That began with refugees fleeing the Mexican Revolution (c. 1910–1920). There are now several towns in Kansas with significant Spanish-speaking populations: Liberal, Garden City, and Dodge City all have Latino populations over 40%. Recently, linguists working with the Kansas Speaks Project have shown how high numbers of Spanish-speaking residents have influenced the dialect of English spoken in areas like Liberal and in other parts of southwest Kansas.

There are many Spanish-language radio stations throughout Kansas, like KYYS in the Kansas City area as well as various Spanish-language newspapers and television stations throughout the state. Several towns in Kansas boast Spanish-English dual language immersion schools in which students are instructed in both languages for varying amounts of time. Examples include Horace Mann Elementary in Wichita, named after the famous educational reformer, and Buffalo Jones Elementary in Garden City, named after Charles &quot;Buffalo&quot; Jones, a frontiersman, bison preservationist, and cofounder of Garden City.

===Puerto Rico===

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico recognizes Spanish and English as official languages, but Spanish is the dominant language and was proclaimed the first official language in 1978. The island was under Spanish control for 400 years; its settlers were mainly Spanish speakers before Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898 following the Spanish-American War.

==Place names==

Because much of the US was once under Spanish, and later Mexican sovereignty, many places have Spanish names dating to these times. These include the names of several states and major cities. Some of these names preserve older features of Spanish orthography, such as San Ysidro, which would be in modern Spanish. Later, many other names were created in the American period by non-Spanish speakers, often violating Spanish syntax. This includes names such as Sierra Vista.

==Learning trends==
In 1917, the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese was founded, and the academic study of Spanish literature was helped by negative attitudes towards German due to World War I.

Spanish is currently the most widely taught language after English in American secondary schools and higher education. More than 790,000 university students were enrolled in Spanish courses in the autumn of 2013, with Spanish the most widely taught foreign language in American colleges and universities. Some 50.6% of the over 1.5 million U.S. students enrolled in foreign-language courses took Spanish, followed by French (12.7%), American Sign Language (7%), German (5.5%), Italian (4.6%), Japanese (4.3%), Chinese (3.9%), Arabic (2.1%), and Latin (1.7%). These totals remain relatively small in relation to the total U.S. population.

==Radio and media==
Spanish language radio is the largest non-English broadcasting media. While foreign language broadcasting declined steadily, Spanish broadcasting grew steadily from the 1920s to the 1970s.

The 1930s were boom years. The early success depended on the concentrated geographical audience in Texas and the Southwest. American stations were close to Mexico, which enabled a steady circular flow of entertainers, executives and technicians and stimulated the creative initiatives of Hispanic radio executives, brokers, and advertisers. Ownership was increasingly concentrated in the 1960s and 1970s. The industry sponsored the now-defunct trade publication &quot;Sponsor&quot; from the late 1940s to 1968. Spanish-language radio has influenced American and Latino discourse on key current affairs issues such as citizenship and immigration.

==Variation==
There is a great diversity of accents of Spanish in the United States. The influence of English on American Spanish is very important. In many Latino (also called Hispanic) youth subcultures, it is common to mix Spanish and English to produce Spanglish, a term for code-switching between English and Spanish, or for Spanish with heavy English influence.

The &quot;Academia Norteamericana de la Lengua Española&quot; (North American Academy of the Spanish Language) tracks the developments of the Spanish spoken in the United States and the influences of English.

===Varieties===
Linguists distinguish the following varieties of the Spanish spoken in the United States:
*Mexican Spanish: the US–Mexico border, throughout the Southwest from California to Texas, as well as in Chicago, but becoming ubiquitous throughout the Continental United States. Standard Mexican Spanish is often used and taught as the standard dialect of Spanish in the Continental United States.
*Caribbean Spanish: Spanish as spoken by Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans. It is largely heard throughout the Northeast and Florida, especially New York City and Miami, and in other cities in the East.
*Central American Spanish: Spanish as spoken by Hispanics with origins in Central American countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. It is largely heard in major cities throughout California and Texas, as well as Washington, DC; New York; and Miami.
*Spanish language in South America: Spanish as spoken by Hispanics with origins in South American countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Bolivia. It is largely heard in major cities throughout New York State, California, Texas, and Florida.
*Colonial Spanish: Spanish as spoken by descendants of Spanish colonists and early Mexicans before the United States expanded and annexed the Southwest and other areas.
**Californian Spanish (1769–present): California, especially the Central Coast
**Isleño Spanish (1783–present): St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana
**Sabine River Spanish: Parts of Sabine and Natchitoches Parishes, Louisiana, and the Moral community west of Nacogdoches. Moribund, originated from rural Mexican Spanish.
**New Mexican Spanish: Central and north-central New Mexico and south-central Colorado and the border regions of Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, and southeastern Colorado

Many Spanish speakers in the US speak it as a heritage language.
Many of these heritage speakers are semi-speakers, or transitional bilinguals, which means they spoke Spanish in early childhood but largely switched to an English-speaking environment. They typically have a strong passive command of the language, but never fully acquired it. Other, fluent heritage speakers have not undergone such a total shift from Spanish to English in their immediate family.

Transitional bilinguals often produce errors which are rarely found among native Spanish speakers but which are common among second-language learners.
Transitional bilinguals often face difficulties in Spanish classrooms since teaching materials designed for English monolinguals and those designed for fluent heritage speakers are both inadequate.

Heritage speakers in general have a native or near-native phonology.

=== Dialect contact ===
Spanish in the US shows mixing and dialect leveling between different varieties of Spanish in large cities with Hispanics of different origins. For example, Salvadorans in Houston show a shift towards lowered rates of /s/ reduction, due to contact with the larger number of Mexican speakers and the low prestige of Salvadoran Spanish.

Los Angeles has its own vernacular Spanish variety, the result of dialect leveling between speakers of different, mainly central Mexican varieties. The children of Salvadoran parents who grow up in Los Angeles typically grow up speaking this variety. Other cities may have their own vernacular Spanish varieties as well.

Voseo, the use of the second person pronoun instead of or alongside the more widespread , is widespread among Honduran and Salvadoran immigrants to the US. The children of these immigrants tend to accommodate to more widespread use of , although at the same time they maintain occasional use of as a symbol of Central American identity. Second-generation Salvadoran-Americans often engage in verbal voseo, using voseo-related verb forms alongside due to linguistic insecurity in contact situations. On the other hand, third-generation Salvadoran-Americans have begun using pronominal voseo, with being used alongside the verb forms associated with .

==Common English words derived from Spanish==
Many standard American English words are of Spanish etymology, or originate from third languages but entered English via Spanish.
* Admiral (originally from Arabic)
* Avocado (&#x27; from Nahuatl &#x27;)
* Aficionado
* Banana (originally from Wolof)
* Buckaroo (&quot;)
* Cafeteria (&quot;)
* Chili (from Nahuatl &quot;)
* Chocolate (from Nahuatl &quot;)
* Cigar (&quot;)
* Corral
* Coyote (from Nahuatl &quot;)
* Desperado (&quot;)
* Guerrilla
* Guitar (&quot;)
* Hurricane (&quot; from the Taíno storm god Juracán)
* Junta
* Lasso (&quot;)
* Patio
* Potato (&quot;&quot;; see Etymology of &quot;potato&quot;)
* Ranch (&quot;)
* Rodeo
* Siesta
* Tomato (&#x27; from Nahuatl &#x27;)
* Tornado
* Vanilla (&quot;)
==Phonology==
Spanish in the US often has some phonological influence from English. For example, bilinguals who grew up in the Mesilla Valley in southern New Mexico most often merge the two rhotic consonants and as . The use of a trill is even less frequent in northern New Mexico, where contact with monolingual Mexican Spanish is lesser.

 has been reported as an allophone of in Chicano Spanish in the Southwest, both when spelled and when spelled . This is primarily due to English influence.
Although Mexican Spanish generally pronounces as a velar fricative, Chicano Spanish often realizes it as a glottal , like English&#x27;s h sound. In addition, may occasionally be realized as a fricative in initial position.

The vowel system of Spanish speakers in the US may also be affected by English influence. For example, can be fronted.

Much of the variation in US Spanish pronunciation reflects the differences between other Spanish dialects and varieties:

*As in most of Hispanic America, and (before and ) are pronounced as , the same way as . Note that &quot;seseo&quot; (the act of not distinguishing from ) is not only typical of the speech of Latino Americans but is also typical among Hispanic Americans of Andalusian and Canarian descent.
*Spanish in Spain, particularly the regions with a distinctive phoneme, pronounces with the tip of tongue against the alveolar ridge. Phonetically, that is an &quot;apico-alveolar&quot; &quot;grave&quot; sibilant , with a weak &quot;hushing&quot; sound that is reminiscent of fricatives. In the Americas and in Andalusia and the Canary Islands, both in Spain, Standard European Spanish may sound similar to like English &quot;sh&quot; as in &quot;she&quot;. However, that apico-alveolar realization of is common in some Latin American Spanish dialects which lack . Some inland Colombian Spanish, particularly Antioquia, and Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia also have an apico-alveolar .
*Spanish in the Americas usually features &quot;yeísmo&quot;, with no distinction being made between and as both are pronounced . &quot;Yeísmo&quot; is an expanding and now dominant feature of European Spanish as well, particularly in urban speech (Madrid, Toledo) and in Andalusia and the Canary Islands, but is still preserved in some rural areas of northern Spain. Speakers of Rioplatense Spanish pronounce both and as or . The traditional pronunciation of the digraph , , is preserved in some dialects along the Andes range, especially in inland Peru and the highlands of Colombia highlands, northern Argentina, and all of Bolivia and Paraguay.
*Most speakers with ancestors born in the coastal regions may debuccalize or aspirate syllable-final to or entirely drop; this, &quot;está&quot; (&quot;s/he is&quot;) sounds like or , as in southern Spain (Andalusia, Murcia, Castile–La Mancha (except the northeastern part), Canary Islands, Ceuta, and Melilla).
* (before or ) and are usually aspirated to in Caribbean and other coastal dialects as well as in Colombia, southern Mexico, and most of southern Spain. While it may be in other dialects of the Americas and often in Peru, that is a common feature of Castilian Spanish. It is usually aspirated to , like in most of southwestern Spain. Very often, especially in Argentina and Chile, becomes more fronted before high vowels and then approaches the realization of German in &quot;ich&quot;. In other phonological environments, it is realized as either or .
*In many Caribbean dialects, the phonemes and can be exchanged or sound alike at the end of a syllable: &quot;caldo&quot; &gt; &quot;ca[r]do&quot;, &quot;cardo&quot; &gt; &quot;ca[l]do&quot;. At the end of words, becomes silent, which gives Caribbean Spanish a partial non-rhoticity. That occurs left often happens as well in Ecuador and Chile and is a feature brought from Extremadura and westernmost Andalusia, in Spain.
*In many Andean regions, the alveolar trill of &quot;rata&quot; and &quot;carro&quot; is realized as an alveolar approximant or even a voiced apico-alveolar . The alveolar approximant is particularly associated with an indigenous substrate and is quite common in Andean regions, especially in inland Ecuador, Peru, most of Bolivia, and parts of northern Argentina and Paraguay.
*In Puerto Rico, besides , , and , syllable-final can be realized as , an influence of American English: &quot;verso&quot;&#x27; (verse) can become , besides , , or ; &quot;&quot;invierno&quot; (winter) can become , aside from , , or ; and &quot;escarlata&quot;&quot; (scarlet) can become , aside from , , or []. Word-finally, is usually one of the following:
** a trill, a tap, an approximant, , or silent before a consonant or a pause, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;paterno&quot; (&#x27;paternal love&#x27;);
** a tap, an approximant, or before a vowel-initial word, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;eterno&quot; (&#x27;eternal love&#x27;).
*Voiced consonants , , and are pronounced as plosives after and sometimes before any consonant in most Colombian Spanish dialects (rather than the fricative or approximant characteristic of most other dialects), as in &quot;pardo&quot; , &quot;barba&quot; , &quot;algo&quot; , &quot;peligro&quot; , &quot;desde&quot; , rather than , , , , . A notable exception is the Nariño Department and most &quot;Costeño&quot; speech (Atlantic coastal dialects), which feature the soft fricatives that are common to all other Hispanic American and European dialects.
*Word-finally, is frequently velar in Latin American Spanish and &quot;pan&quot; (bread) is often pronounced . To an English-speaker, the makes &quot;pan&quot; sound like &quot;pang&quot;. Velarization of word-final is so widespread in the Americas that only a few regions maintain the alveolar , as in Europe: most of Mexico, Colombia (except for coastal dialects), and Argentina (except for some northern regions). Elsewhere, velarization is common although alveolar word-final appears among some educated speakers, especially in the media or in singing. Velar word-final is also frequent in Spain, especially in the South (Andalusia and the Canary Islands) and in the Northwest: Galicia, Asturias, and León.

==Vocabulary and grammar==
The vocabulary and grammar of US Spanish reflect English influence, accelerated change, and the Latin American roots of most US Spanish.
One example of English influence is that the usage of Spanish words by American bilinguals shows a convergence of semantics between English and Spanish cognates. For example, the Spanish words &quot;atender&quot; (&quot;to pay attention to&quot;) and &quot;éxito&quot; (&quot;success&quot;) have acquired a similar semantic range in American Spanish to the English words &quot;attend&quot; and &quot;exit.&quot; In some cases, loanwords from English turn existing Spanish words into homonyms: &quot;coche&quot; has come to acquire the additional meaning of &quot;coach&quot; in the United States, it retains its older meaning of &quot;car.&quot;
Other phenomena include:

* Loan translations such as &#x27;to run for&#x27;, &#x27;to apply for&#x27;, and instead of &#x27;to dream of&#x27; frequently occur.
* Expressions with , such as , are widespread. Though these appear to be calques, they likely represent a semantic extension.
* Spanish speakers in the US tend to use more often instead of . This is an extension of an ongoing trend within Spanish, since historically was used far less often. For more information, see Spanish copulas.
* Spanish speakers in the southwest tend to use the morphological future tense exclusively to express grammatical mood. The periphrastic construction &#x27; infinitive&#x27; is used for speaking about events that will occur in the future.
* In Chicano Spanish varieties, the word has acquired a very wide range of meanings, much like the English word &quot;get&quot;.
* While varieties of Spanish in the US have traditionally not used voseo, this feature has been introduced by Central American immigrants. While the children of these immigrants use voseo much less often than their parents, the pronoun remains as a symbol of identity. Verbal voseo is often found among linguistically insecure second-generation Salvadoran-Americans in contact with speakers of other varieties, while pronominal voseo is often found among third-generation Salvadoran-Americans who have adopted the -related verb forms but maintain the pronoun as a symbol of identity.
* Spanish-speakers who are more proficient in English tend to use the subjunctive mood less often. This same preference for the indicative also correlates independently with lower education in Spanish, reflecting variation in monolingual Spanish.
*Disappearance of &quot;de&quot; (of) in certain expressions, as is the case with Canarian Spanish: &quot;esposo Rosa&quot; for &quot;esposo de Rosa&quot;, &quot;gofio millo&quot; for &quot;gofio de millo&quot;, etc.
*Doublets of Arabic-Latin synonyms, with the Arabic form being more common in American Spanish, which derives from Latin American Spanish and so is influenced by Andalusian Spanish, like Andalusian and Latin American &quot;alcoba&quot; for standard peninsular &quot;habitación&quot; or &quot;dormitorio&quot; (&#x27;bedroom&#x27;) or &quot;alhaja&quot; for standard &quot;joya&quot; (&#x27;jewel&#x27;).

==Future==
Spanish is the most commonly spoken non-English language in the United States. Continued immigration is a key reason for the continued presence and use of Spanish, since the descendants of early immigrants and those incorporated into the United States as a result of annexation have largely undergone language shift to English.

Spanish-language mass media (such as Univisión, Telemundo, and the former Azteca América) support the use of Spanish, although they increasingly serve bilingual audiences. In addition, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) makes many American manufacturers use multilingual product labeling in English, French, and Spanish, three of the four official languages of the Organization of American States (OAS).

Besides the specialized businesses that have long catered to Hispanophone immigrants, a small but increasing number of mainstream American retailers also now advertise bilingually in Spanish-speaking areas and offer bilingual customer services. One common indicator of such businesses is &quot;Se Habla Español&quot;, which means &quot;Spanish Is Spoken&quot;.

The annual State of the Union Address and other presidential speeches are translated into Spanish, following the precedent set by the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Moreover, non-Hispanic American origin politicians fluent in Spanish speak in Spanish to Hispanic-majority constituencies. There are 500 Spanish newspapers, 152 magazines, and 205 publishers in the United States. Magazine and local television advertising expenditures for the Hispanic market have increased substantially from 1999 to 2003, with growth of 58 percent and 43 percent, respectively.

Historically, immigrants&#x27; languages tend to disappear or to be reduced by generational assimilation, with English monolingualism predominant by the third generation. This pattern has largely held steady among more recent immigrants—including Spanish-speakers—and their descendants.

Spanish disappeared in several countries and US territories during the 20th century, notably in the Philippines and in the Pacific Island countries of Guam, Micronesia, Palau, the Northern Marianas islands, and the Marshall Islands.

The English-only movement seeks to establish English as the sole official language of the United States. Generally, they exert political public pressure upon Hispanophone immigrants to learn English and speak it publicly. As universities, business, and the professions use English, there is much social pressure to learn English for upward socio-economic mobility. These social pressures and policies contribute to the loss of Spanish and the shift to English.

Generally, Hispanics (13.4% of the 2002 US population) are bilingual to a degree. A Simmons Market Research survey recorded that 19 percent of Hispanics speak only Spanish, 9 percent speak only English, 55 percent have limited English proficiency, and 17 percent are fully English-Spanish bilingual.

Intergenerational transmission of Spanish is a more accurate indicator of Spanish&#x27;s future in the United States than raw statistical numbers of Hispanophones. Although Hispanics hold varying English proficiency levels, almost all second-generation Hispanics speak English, but about 50 percent speak Spanish at home. Two thirds of third-generation Mexican Americans speak only English at home. Calvin Veltman undertook in 1988, for the National Center for Education Statistics and for the Hispanic Policy Development Project, the most complete study of Anglicization by Hispanophone immigrants. Veltman&#x27;s language shift studies document abandonment of Spanish at rates of 40 percent for immigrants who arrived in the US before the age of 14, and 70 percent for immigrants who arrived before the age of 10. The complete set of the studies&#x27; demographic projections postulates the near-complete assimilation of a given Hispanophone immigrant cohort within two generations. Although his study based itself upon a large 1976 sample from the Bureau of the Census, which has not been repeated, data from the 1990 census tend to confirm the great Anglicization of the Hispanic population.

==Literature==

American literature in Spanish dates back to 1610 when a Spanish explorer Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá first published his epic poem &quot;History of New Mexico&quot;. However, it was not until the late 20th century that Spanish, Spanglish, and bilingual poetry, plays, novels, and essays were readily available on the market through independent, trade, and commercial publishing houses and theaters. Cultural theorist Christopher González identifies Latina/o authors—such as Oscar “Zeta” Acosta, Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Gilbert Hernandez, Sandra Cisneros, and Junot Díaz—as having written innovative works that created new audiences for Hispanic Literature in the United States.

<text>The Welsh Language Society (, also often abbreviated to Cymdeithas yr Iaith or just Cymdeithas in English) is a direct action pressure group in Wales campaigning for the right of Welsh people to use the Welsh language in every aspect of their lives. The chair of the Welsh Language Society since October 2023 is Joseff Gnagbo.

==History==

=== 1960s ===

The Society was established in name on 4 August 1962 at Pontarddulais in South Wales, but did not have a constitution until 18 May 1963. The formation was at least partly inspired by the annual BBC Wales Radio Lecture given on 13 February 1962 by Saunders Lewis and entitled &quot;Tynged yr iaith&quot; (The fate of the language). Historian John Davies has said that the lecture was &quot;the catalyst&quot; for the formation of the Welsh Language Society, and the start of a period of direct-action agitation to enhance the status of the Welsh language. Its direct effect on the formation of the Society is described in a history of that society.

The Society&#x27;s first public protest took place in February 1963 in Aberystwyth town centre, where members pasted posters on the post office in an attempt to be arrested and go to trial. When it became apparent that they would not be arrested for the posters, they then moved to Pont Trefechan in Aberystwyth, where around seventy members and supporters held a sit-in blocking road traffic for half an hour.

The first campaigns were for official status for the language, with a call for Welsh-language tax returns, schools, electoral forms, post office signs, birth certificates and so on. This was done through the formation of &#x27;cells&#x27;, the first operating in Bangor in April 1963 by Owain Owain who also founded and edited the Society&#x27;s only publication, &quot;Tafod y Ddraig&quot; (&#x27;The Dragon&#x27;s Tongue&#x27;) and designed the logo.

In 1968 a sit-in was held at the news and television studio and the newsroom department of the BBC at Broadway, Cardiff, by members of the Society. The sit-in was calling for the BBC to use more Welsh.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
The society believes in direct action, and in the course of its campaigns over a thousand people have appeared before the courts for their part in various campaigns, many receiving prison sentences, making it Britain&#x27;s largest protest group since the suffragettes – in terms of fines and the numbers sent to prison. Typical actions include painting slogans on buildings owned by businesses, and other minor criminal damage.

At the beginning of the 1970s, the society began to campaign for a Welsh-language radio and television service. Radio Cymru was established in 1977, but in 1979 the Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher announced that it would not keep its election promise to establish a separate Welsh-language television channel. Some protesters refused to buy television licences and others climbed up television masts and invaded television studios.

There was much damage to radio and television transmitters:
* Blaenplwyf transmitter was damaged on Monday 7 February 1977, costing £25,000, Dyfed–Powys Police arrested the leader at his home at Cenarth; there was another break-in on Monday 19 November 1979, which included John Rowlands and Geraint H. Jenkins
* Waltham was turned off from 10 pm on Thursday 2 November 1978; the group had broken into The Wrekin on the same night, but had turned off the wrong switch.
* Midhurst was damaged on Thursday 8 February 1979; BBC1 transmissions were restored by Friday but BBC2 took three more days; it caused £15,700 of damage; 23 year old Hywel Pennar, a student at St David&#x27;s Lampeter, was jailed for 9 months; he was the son of Pennar Davies, the Principal from 1959 to 1979 of Swansea Theological College
* Sudbury in Suffolk was damaged on Thursday 15 March 1979 with £20,000 of damage.

The government reversed its position and a Welsh-language TV channel, S4C, was launched in 1982.

=== 2000s ===

On 24 July 2004 (five weeks after launching), Radio Carmarthenshire&#x27;s studios in Narberth were invaded by eleven activists from the Welsh Language Society. They were protesting against Radio Carmarthenshire&#x27;s decision to limit the amount of its Welsh-language programming. The offices and studios were stormed during a live broadcast, taking Radio Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire off-air for fifteen minutes. According to Keri Jones (who later branded the members of the group as &quot;terrorists&quot;), his head of sales was injured, and needed hospital treatment for a fractured wrist sustained during the scuffles which ensued. Police arrested eleven activists, and subsequently released them pending further enquiries. The chair of the movement Steffan Cravos was later found not guilty of causing grievous bodily harm.

The society claimed that 50% of the population in Carmarthenshire speak Welsh as a first language, but less than 5% of Radio Carmarthenshire&#x27;s output was in Welsh. As a result of complaints and pressure from the society and individuals, the United Kingdom&#x27;s broadcasting watchdog Ofcom issued Radio Carmarthenshire with a &#x27;yellow card&#x27; warning in late 2004; any further claims of the station not conforming to its licence agreement would result in the station being severely reprimanded by Ofcom.

=== Response to the 2011 Census results ===
Following the 2011 Census results, the group held a series of rallies across Wales. In the first rally in in December 2012, the group published its &#x27; (Living Manifesto) which outlined tens of policies designed to strengthen the language. The society launched the &quot;&#x27;&quot; (I want to live in Welsh) slogan at the same rally.

On 6 February 2013 and 4 July 2013, deputations of the society met First Minister Carwyn Jones to press for urgent policy changes in light of the Census results.

A revised version of the &quot; was published in July 2013, following a public consultation and an extraordinary general meeting when a number of amendments to the manifesto were adopted.

In August 2013, the group wrote to the First Minister Carwyn Jones, giving him six months to state his intention to deliver for the benefit of the language:
# &quot; (Welsh-medium Education for All)
# &quot; (Financial Fairness for the Welsh language)
# &quot; (Internal Government in Welsh)
# &quot; (Language Standards to Create Clear Rights)
# &quot; (A Planning System for the benefit of our Communities)
# &quot; (Welsh as central to Sustainable Development)

Carwyn Jones had made no such statement of intent by 1 February 2014, and the group started a direct action campaign and held a series of protests across the country.

=== Ongoing campaigns ===

* In 2015, the society began calling for Welsh medium education to be extended to every school pupil in Wales, to &#x27;give them the ability to communicate and work&#x27; in the language. This call was supported by the linguist David Crystal and academic Christine James. These calls include a call for an Education Act for Welsh language education for all.
* Sustainable communities; a property act to help tackle the housing crisis and second home issue.
* The devolution of broadcasting to Wales.

== Successful campaigns ==

According to the language group&#x27;s website, its campaigns have contributed to securing the following policy changes for the language:

*1960s – Bilingual road signs
*1970s – Welsh-language television channel campaign and establishment of S4C, the world&#x27;s only Welsh-language television channel, in 1982.
*1993 – Welsh Language Act 1993 enacted, requiring public bodies to offer limited Welsh-language services
*2000s – Campaign for new Welsh Language Act and official status for the language under the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011
*2011 – Welsh-medium higher education college, , established

== Campaign areas ==

The principal campaigns can be divided into four major areas:

=== &quot; (Rights to the Welsh language) ===

At the beginning of the 21st century, the society started a campaign for a new Welsh Language Act. The Welsh Language Act 1993 declared that Welsh should be treated on an equal basis with English, but the society argued that this fell short of what is needed.

In 2007, the society published its own , draft legislation which would amongst other things establish official status for the Welsh language and rights to use it, and establish the office of the Welsh Language Commissioner.

In 2011, based in large part on the society&#x27;s proposals, the National Assembly for Wales passed the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011, which established the Welsh language as an official language of Wales, and introduced the Welsh Language Commissioner.

=== &quot; (Sustainable Communities) ===

This group leads on a number of matters, including housing and planning policy. Since the 1980s the group has called for a to increase the number of communities where Welsh is the main language of the area as well as tackling income inequality and environmental problems.

On 11 March 2014, the group published its own draft &quot; which would enshrine the six main principles of its proposal for a Property Act as well as establishing the Welsh language as a statutory material consideration in the planning system.

=== &quot; (Digital Future) ===

This group campaigns for rights to see and hear the language. This includes campaigns for investment in and S4C, as well as the presence of the Welsh language online.

=== &quot; (Education Group) ===

Welsh medium education is available in most areas of Wales in the primary and secondary stages of school education. Welsh second-language GCSEs are compulsory in English medium education. This group demands improvements and also massive expansion in further (college) and higher (university) education. This mainly includes a Welsh language federal college, which would be a multi-sited college that provides courses and resources in the medium of Welsh.

<doc id="189111" wikidata="Q7888185" url="?curid=189111" title="United Kingdom prison population">
<text>The United Kingdom has three distinct legal systems with a separate prison system in each: one for both England and Wales, one for Scotland, and one for Northern Ireland. As of June 2023, the United Kingdom has the highest per-capita incarceration rate in Western Europe, at 159 people per 100,000 in England and Wales; 162 people per 100,000 in Scotland; 97 people per 100,000 in Northern Ireland; and the largest prison population in Western Europe. The average cost per prison place (including all resource expenditure) was £46,696 in England and Wales (2021/22), £46,892 in Scotland (2021/22), and £47,927 in Northern Ireland (2022/23).

As of June 2023, the total UK prison population was 95,526: composed of 85,851 prisoners from England and Wales, 7,775 from Scotland and 1,900 from Northern Ireland. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, there were 87,869 prisoners in England and Wales.

==Demographics==
===People from ethnic minority backgrounds===
According to House of Commons research, people of minority ethnicities (BAME) constitute 13% of the general population, but make up 27% of the prison population. In 2017, a review led by David Lammy MP concluded that the justice system was biased against this group, and required reform. In 2019, Lammy expressed deep concern at the high proportion of BAME males in young offender institutions with 51% of boys in young offender institutions identifying as BAME, saying that &quot;England and Wales are now hitting an American scale of disproportionality in our youth justice system&quot;. The over-representation of the black population in prisons may be a result of stop and search, custodial remands and the make-up of the prison population itself with 32% of all children in prison being black.

===Religious group===

In the two decades since 2002, the proportion of Christian prisoners has fallen, by 14%, to 44% of the incarcerated population meanwhile the proportion of Muslim prisoners has risen, by 10%, to 18%. Other religious groups did not see a significant change in proportion. Beginning in 2008, concerns over the spread of Sharia in British prisons, including the operation of Sharia courts and the forced conversions of non-muslims, have been reported. According to the UK prison officers&#x27; union in 2013, some Muslim prisoners in the UK had allegedly forcibly converted fellow inmates to Islam in prisons. There have been multiple cases of non-muslim prisoners threatened with violence with &quot;convert or get hurt&quot; being a commonly used phrase by Muslim gangs according to an independent report published by the government. In category A and B prisons, former inmates have publicly spoken out on the rise of Islamism with the &quot;balance of power&quot; in reputational violence now shifted towards Muslim gangs. Other reasons why inmates may convert include wanting protection in wings where Muslim gangs are prevalent, the ability to go to chapel, and access to different foods. Around 1 in 5 Muslim prisoners in the UK are now white.

The Fishmonger&#x27;s Hall, Streatham, and Reading attacks brought increased attention on the risk of Islamist gangs and convicted terrorists radicalising other inmates in prisons. Concerns were first raised in 2010 by the Royal United Services Institute over the growing radicalisation of Muslims in prisons. According to Jonathan Hall KC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, convicted terrorists &quot;enjoy high status&quot; in prisons and other inmates are attracted to their extremist interpretation of Islam. The 2023 CONTEST report found that Islamic terrorists represented 64% of those in custody for terrorism-connected offences with 44% of declared terrorist attacks in the UK since 2018 perpetrated by serving or recently released Muslim prisoners. Attempts to engage imprisoned terrorists with de-radicalisation programmes have been largely unsuccessful.

===Immigrants and foreign nationals===
76,869 British nationals were recorded in the prison population at the end of the first quarter of 2024. The remainder of the population was made up of 10,422 foreign nationals, making up 11.9% of the total population, with an additional 578 having no nationality recorded. 

In 2024, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; conducted analysis of Ministry of Justice data on foreign nationals alongside recent census data and found that 1 in 50 Albanians in the UK were in jail. Albanians had the highest imprisonment rate, followed by Kosovans, Vietnamese, Algerians, Jamaicans, Eritreans, Iraqis and Somalis. Conversely German, Italian, Indian, Greek, US, Sri Lankan, French and Chinese nationals were the least likely nationalities to be in prison. Overall, the imprisonment rate of foreign nationals was 27 per cent higher than for British citizens.

===Age group===

Children and young people aged under 18 are not sent to adult prisons if they are sentenced to custody. They either go to young offender institutions (for prisoners aged 15–21), secure training centres (for those aged under 17) or secure children&#x27;s homes (for those aged under 15).

The number of children in custody has declined since mid-2008, from more than 3,000 to about 900 at any one time. In 2019 an independent inquiry into child sexual abuse published a report that described the scale of alleged abuse in young offender institutions and secure training centres as “shockingly high”.

The number of British prisoners over 60 years of age rose by 130% between 2002 and 2013, a shift attributed to an increase in the convictions for historic sex abuse. The increase was reported after the 2012 commencement of Operation Yewtree, a police investigation into sexual abuse allegations—predominantly the abuse of children—against the British media personality Jimmy Savile and others. In relation to over 4,000 over-60 prisoners in UK prisons, Professor David Wilson of Birmingham City University stated in July 2014:
Four out of 10 of these prisoners (the over-60s) were convicted of sex offences and people over 60 are the fastest growing age group in the prison estate, yet there is no national strategy for the elderly who get sent to prison ... The Prison Service needs to develop a strategy to cope with this fastest growing section of the prison population or they will simply be failing in their duty of care to the elderly people that they are locking up.

In 2018 there were more than 1,500 prisoners over 70, including more than 200 aged over 80, creating increasing demands on health and social care systems.

===Gender===
3,635 women were recorded in the prison population (4.1%) at the end of the first quarter of 2024. As of 2018, most were serving time for non-violent offences. There is evidence that women may be a particularly vulnerable prison population: they account for 20% of self-injury behind bars, and are twice as likely to report mental health issues as male prisoners. In 2018 the government launched a new Female Offender Strategy to try and address the needs of this particular population.

Women with a child aged under 18 months old may apply to bring their child into prison with them, if they are serving a short sentence. Women who give birth in prison may keep their baby for the first 18 months in a mother and baby unit.

==Prison population==

===Veterans===
A growing number of British prisoners are former armed forces members. According to a study reported in the &quot;Guardian&quot; in 2009, 8500 former servicemen were imprisoned, making up almost 10% of the prison population.

===Scotland===
Scotland recognized the growth in the prison population and acted accordingly to make adjustments to how the law was carried out so that the system operates efficiently. One of the actions made was to decrease the number of stop-and-searches and between the period of June 2015 and August 2016, there was reportedly an 81% decrease in those actions when statistics from 2014 were compared.

===Drug abusers===
The proportion of prisoners developing a drug abuse problem while incarcerated rose from 8.4% in 2013-2014 to nearly 15% in 2018–2019. Much of the prison system is badly equipped to disrupt illegal drug supply and security standards vary between prisons. Reform maintains prisons are overcrowded, staff retention is poor and using community sentences instead of prison for minor offenses would help. Aidan Shilson-Thomas of Reform said, “There must always be a place in prison for those who commit serious crimes. However, prison must also be an opportunity for inmates to change their behaviour. Stabilising the system means stemming the flow of drugs, reducing overcrowding, fixing the crumbling estate and improving officer retention. Its long-term sustainability requires a serious conversation about how many people we lock up and for how long. Failing to act will mean poorer social outcomes, more reoffending and ultimately huge costs to the taxpayer.”

<doc id="189113" wikidata="Q945712" url="?curid=189113" title="Burhou">
<text>Burhou (pronounced &quot;ber-ROO&quot;) is a small island about northwest of Alderney that is part of the Channel Islands. It has no permanent residents, and is a bird sanctuary, so landing there is banned from March 15 to August 1. The island&#x27;s wildlife includes a colony of puffins (declining in numbers) and many rabbits. The island has no landing stage as such, but visitors use a small inlet. In rough weather it may be impossible to land.

The Guernsey botanist E. D. Marquand called it, &quot;the most desolate and lonely of all the islands in our archipelago.&quot; He once had to spend the night there, as his return journey was delayed by fog.

The 1906 book, &quot;The Channel Pilot&quot; states –

==History==
===Prehistory===
Despite being isolated, and inhabited briefly and infrequently, Burhou has a long history. Formerly, like the rest of the English Channel, it would have been linked to both modern-day England and France by dry land many thousands of years ago.

Burhou, like many other Channel Islands (e.g. Lihou, Jethou), has the Norman suffix &quot;-hou&quot;, meaning a small island, from the Old Norse &quot;holmr&quot;. According to Dr. S.K. Kellet-Smith, &quot;bur&quot; refers to a storehouse – &quot;Burhou is just the place where a fisherman would place a depository for his gear&quot;.

However, signs of human occupation/visitation are much older. Flint flakes have been found on the island, and one is currently in the Alderney Museum. In 1847, F. C. Lukis found two standing stones, but these have since been lost, according to the archaeologist David Johnston.

===The hut===
According to the Assize Roll of the 14th century, Burhou was a rabbit warren, and a refuge for fishermen. As Victor Coysh deduces, this would have meant that there would have been some kind of shelter there, as it would be difficult for the fishermen to take refuge without it.

A hut was built on the island in 1820 as a shelter for fishermen and sailors at the instigation of John Le Mesurier (hereditary governor of Alderney), but was destroyed during the German occupation of the Channel Islands (the Wehrmacht used it for target practice during WWII). The hut was replaced in 1953, with basic accommodation which is rented out to visitors by Alderney Harbour Office.

Attempts have been periodically made to raise sheep there. In 1900, a French couple lived there for a year. The soil is thin, and spray frequently goes right over the island, ensuring high soil salinity. The island has no fresh water supply for much of the year, and has to rely on shipments, or formerly tanks.

==Flora and fauna==
The island&#x27;s animals are mainly birds, although rabbits are long established here. The island has many puffins and some storm petrels. Although the latter have declined, they used to nest in the cottage&#x27;s storm loft. Roderick Dobson in &quot;Birds of the Channel Islands&quot; said that puffins had been plentiful for over a century. The &quot;Birds of Guernsey&quot; (1878) by Cecil Smith states likewise. The puffins have had to compete with gulls, and in 1949, hundreds died from red mite infestation. The rabbit holes on the island make good nesting for them.

Amongst the plants noted here are sea spurry, forget-me-nots, scarlet pimpernel, field bugloss, bracken and nettles. E. D. Marquand noted a mere 18 species of plant here in 1909, but by the late twentieth century, Frances Le Sueur and David McClintock found 45, which they wrote up in the &quot;Transactions of La Société Guernesiaise&quot;.
