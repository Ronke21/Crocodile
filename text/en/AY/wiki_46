<text>Glutethimide is a hypnotic sedative that was introduced by Ciba in 1954 as a safe alternative to barbiturates to treat insomnia. Before long, however, it had become clear that glutethimide was just as likely to cause addiction and caused similar withdrawal symptoms. Doriden was the brand-name version. Current production levels in the United States (the annual quota for manufacturing imposed by the DEA has been three grams, enough for six Doriden tablets, for a number of years) point to its use only in small-scale research. Manufacturing of the drug was discontinued in the US in 1993 and discontinued in several eastern European countries in 2006.

==Long term use==
Long-term use rebound effects, which resemble those seen in barbiturate withdrawal, have anecdotally been described in patients who were still taking a stable dose of the drug. The symptoms include delirium, hallucinosis, convulsions and fever.

==Recreational use==
Glutethimide is a CYP2D6 enzyme inducer. When taken with codeine, (known on the streets as &quot;hits&quot;, &quot;cibas and codeine&quot;, &quot;Dors and 4s&quot;) it enables the body to convert higher amounts of the codeine to morphine. The general sedative effect of the glutethimide also adds to the effect of the combination. It produces an intense, long lasting euphoria similar to IV heroin use. A number of deaths have occurred from abuse of this combination. The effect was also used clinically, including some research in the 1970s in various countries of using it under carefully monitored circumstances as a form of oral opioid agonist substitution therapy, e.g. as a &quot;Substitutionmittel&quot; that may be a useful alternative to methadone. The demand for this combination in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark, NYC, Boston, Baltimore, and surrounding areas of other states and perhaps elsewhere, has led to small-scale clandestine synthesis of glutethimide since 1984, a process that is, like methaqualone (Quaalude) synthesis, somewhat difficult and fraught with potential bad outcomes when amateur chemists manufacture the drugs with industrial-grade precursors without adequate quality control. The fact that the simpler clandestine synthesis of other extinct pharmaceutical depressants like ethchlorvynol, methyprylon, or the oldest barbiturates is not reported would seem to point to a high level of motivation surrounding a unique drug, again much like methaqualone. Production of glutethimide was discontinued in the US in 1993 and in several eastern European countries, most notably Hungary, in 2006. Analysis of confiscated glutethimide seems to invariably show the drug or the results of attempted synthesis, whereas purported methaqualone is in a significant majority of cases found to be inert, or contain diphenhydramine or benzodiazepines.

==Legal status==
Glutethimide is a Schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It was originally a Schedule III drug in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act, but in 1991 it was upgraded to Schedule II, several years after it was discovered that misuse combined with codeine increased the effect of the codeine and deaths had resulted from the combination. It has a DEA ACSCN of 2550 and a 2013 production quota of 3 g.

==Synthesis==
The (R) isomer has a faster onset and more potent anticonvulsant activity in animal models than the (S) isomer.
The base catalyzed conjugate addition of 2-phenylbutyronitrile [769-68-6] (1) to ethyl acrylate (2) gives ethyl 4-cyano-4-phenylhexanoate, CID:139890735 (3). Alkaline hydrolysis of the nitrile group into an amide group, and subsequent acidic cyclization of the product affords the desired glutethimide (4).

<text>The structural formula of a chemical compound is a graphic representation of the molecular structure (determined by structural chemistry methods), showing how the atoms are connected to one another. The chemical bonding within the molecule is also shown, either explicitly or implicitly. Unlike other chemical formula types, which have a limited number of symbols and are capable of only limited descriptive power, structural formulas provide a more complete geometric representation of the molecular structure. For example, many chemical compounds exist in different isomeric forms, which have different enantiomeric structures but the same molecular formula. There are multiple types of ways to draw these structural formulas such as: Lewis structures, condensed formulas, skeletal formulas, Newman projections, Cyclohexane conformations, Haworth projections, and Fischer projections.

Several systematic chemical naming formats, as in chemical databases, are used that are equivalent to, and as powerful as, geometric structures. These chemical nomenclature systems include SMILES, InChI and CML. These systematic chemical names can be converted to structural formulas and vice versa, but chemists nearly always describe a chemical reaction or synthesis using structural formulas rather than chemical names, because the structural formulas allow the chemist to visualize the molecules and the structural changes that occur in them during chemical reactions. ChemSketch and ChemDraw are popular downloads/websites that allow users to draw reactions and structural formulas, typically in the Lewis Structure style.

== Structures in structural formulas ==

=== Bonds ===
Bonds are often shown as a line that connects one atom to another. One line indicates a single bond. Two lines indicate a double bond, and three lines indicate a triple bond. In some structures the atoms in between each bond are specified and shown. However, in some structures, the carbon molecules are not written out specifically. Instead, these carbons are indicated by a corner that forms when two lines connect. Additionally, Hydrogen atoms are implied and not usually drawn out. These can be inferred based on how many other atoms the carbon is attached to. For example, if Carbon A is attached to one other Carbon B, Carbon A will have three hydrogens in order to fill its octet.

=== Electrons ===

Electrons are usually shown as colored-in circles. One circle indicates one electron. Two circles indicate a pair of electrons. Typically, a pair of electrons will also indicate a negative charge. By using the colored circles, the number of electrons in the valence shell of each respective atom is indicated, providing further descriptive information regarding the reactive capacity of that atom in the molecule.

=== Charges ===
Oftentimes, atoms will have a positive or negative charge as their octet may not be complete. If the atom is missing a pair of electrons or has a proton, it will have a positive charge. If the atom has electrons that are not bonded to another atom, there will be a negative charge. In structural formulas, the positive charge is indicated by ⊕ , and the negative charge is indicated by ⊖ .
=== Stereochemistry (Skeletal formula) ===
 Chirality in skeletal formulas is indicated by the Natta projection method. Stereochemistry is used to show the relative spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Wedges are used to show this, and there are two types: dashed and filled. A filled wedge indicates that the atom is in the front of the molecule; it is pointing above the plane of the paper towards the front. A dashed wedge indicates that the atom is behind the molecule; it is pointing below the plane of the paper. When a straight, un-dashed line is used, the atom is in the plane of the paper. This spatial arrangement provides an idea of the molecule in a 3-dimensional space and there are constraints as to how the spatial arrangements can be arranged.

=== Unspecified stereochemistry ===

Wavy single bonds represent unknown or unspecified stereochemistry or a mixture of isomers. For example, the adjacent diagram shows the fructose molecule with a wavy bond to the HOCH2- group at the left. In this case the two possible ring structures are in chemical equilibrium with each other and also with the open-chain structure. The ring automatically opens and closes, sometimes closing with one stereochemistry and sometimes with the other.

Skeletal formulas can depict &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; isomers of alkenes. Wavy single bonds are the standard way to represent unknown or unspecified stereochemistry or a mixture of isomers (as with tetrahedral stereocenters). A crossed double-bond has been used sometimes, but is no longer considered an acceptable style for general use.

== Lewis structures ==
Lewis structures (or &quot;Lewis dot structures&quot;) are flat graphical formulas that show atom connectivity and lone pair or unpaired electrons, but not three-dimensional structure. This notation is mostly used for small molecules. Each line represents the two electrons of a single bond. Two or three parallel lines between pairs of atoms represent double or triple bonds, respectively. Alternatively, pairs of dots may be used to represent bonding pairs. In addition, all non-bonded electrons (paired or unpaired) and any formal charges on atoms are indicated. Through the use of Lewis structures, the placement of electrons, whether it is in a bond or in lone pairs, will allow for the identification of the formal charges of the atoms in the molecule to understand the stability and determine the most likely molecule (based on molecular geometry difference) that would be formed in a reaction. Lewis structures do give some thought to the geometry of the molecule as oftentimes, the bonds are drawn at certain angles to represent the molecule in real life. Lewis structure is best used to calculate formal charges or how atoms bond to each other as both electrons and bonds are shown. Lewis structures give an idea of the molecular and electronic geometry which varies based on the presence of bonds and lone pairs and through this one could determine the bond angles and hybridization as well.

== Condensed formulas ==

In early organic-chemistry publications, where use of graphics was strongly limited, a typographic system arose to describe organic structures in a line of text. Although this system tends to be problematic in application to cyclic compounds, it remains a convenient way to represent simple structures:

: (ethanol)

Parentheses are used to indicate multiple identical groups, indicating attachment to the nearest non-hydrogen atom on the left when appearing within a formula, or to the atom on the right when appearing at the start of a formula:

: (2-propanol)

In all cases, all atoms are shown, including hydrogen atoms. It is also helpful to show the carbonyls where the C=O is implied through the O being placed in the parentheses. For example:

: (acetone)

Therefore, it is important to look to the left of the atom in the parentheses to make sure what atom it is attached to. This is helpful when converting from condensed formula to another form of structural formula such as skeletal formula or Lewis structures. There are different ways to show the various functional groups in the condensed formulas such as aldehyde as CHO, carboxylic acids as or COOH, esters as or COOR. However, the use of condensed formulas does not give an immediate idea of the molecular geometry of the compound or the number of bonds between the carbons, it needs to be recognized based on the number of atoms attached to the carbons and if there are any charges on the carbon.

== Skeletal formulas ==
Skeletal formulas are the standard notation for more complex organic molecules. In this type of diagram, first used by the organic chemist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz, the carbon atoms are implied to be located at the vertices (corners) and ends of line segments rather than being indicated with the atomic symbol C. Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon atoms are not indicated: each carbon atom is understood to be associated with enough hydrogen atoms to give the carbon atom four bonds. The presence of a positive or negative charge at a carbon atom takes the place of one of the implied hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms attached to atoms other than carbon must be written explicitly. An additional feature of skeletal formulas is that by adding certain structures the stereochemistry, that is the three-dimensional structure, of the compound can be determined. Often times, the skeletal formula can indicate stereochemistry through the use of wedges instead of lines. Solid wedges represent bonds pointing above the plane of the paper, whereas dashed wedges represent bonds pointing below the plane.

== Perspective drawings ==
=== Newman projection and sawhorse projection ===

The Newman projection and the sawhorse projection are used to depict specific conformers or to distinguish vicinal stereochemistry. In both cases, two specific carbon atoms and their connecting bond are the center of attention. The only difference is a slightly different perspective: the Newman projection looking straight down the bond of interest, the sawhorse projection looking at the same bond but from a somewhat oblique vantage point. In the Newman projection, a circle is used to represent a plane perpendicular to the bond, distinguishing the substituents on the front carbon from the substituents on the back carbon. In the sawhorse projection, the front carbon is usually on the left and is always slightly lower. Sometimes, an arrow is used to indicate the front carbon. The sawhorse projection is very similar to a skeletal formula, and it can even use wedges instead of lines to indicate the stereochemistry of the molecule. The sawhorse projection is set apart from the skeletal formulas because the sawhorse projection is not a very good indicator of molecule geometry and molecular arrangement. Both a Newman and Sawhorse Projection can be used to create a Fischer Projection.

=== Cyclohexane conformations ===

Certain conformations of cyclohexane and other small-ring compounds can be shown using a standard convention. For example, the standard chair conformation of cyclohexane involves a perspective view from slightly above the average plane of the carbon atoms and indicates clearly which groups are axial (pointing vertically up or down) and which are equatorial (almost horizontal, slightly slanted up or down). Bonds in front may or may not be highlighted with stronger lines or wedges. The conformations progress as follows: chair to half-chair to twist-boat to boat to twist-boat to half-chair to chair. The cyclohexane conformations may also be used to show the potential energy present at each stage as shown in the diagram. The chair conformations (A) have the lowest energy, whereas the half-chair conformations (D) have the highest energy. There is a peak/local maximum at the boat conformation (C), and there are valleys/local minimums at the twist-boat conformations (B). In addition, cyclohexane conformations can be used to indicate if the molecule has any 1,3 diaxial-interactions which are steric interactions between axial substituents on the 1,3, and 5 carbons.
=== Haworth projection ===

The Haworth projection is used for cyclic sugars. Axial and equatorial positions are not distinguished; instead, substituents are positioned directly above or below the ring atom to which they are connected. Hydrogen substituents are typically omitted.

However, an important thing to keep in mind while reading an Haworth projection is that the ring structures are not flat. Therefore, Haworth does not provide 3-D shape. Sir Norman Haworth, was a British Chemist, who won a Nobel Prize for his work on Carbohydrates and discovering the structure of Vitamin C. During his discovery, he also deducted different structural formulas which are now referred to as Haworth Projections. In a Haworth Projection a pyranose sugar is depicted as a hexagon and a furanose sugar is depicted as a pentagon. Usually an oxygen is placed at the upper right corner in pyranose and in the upper center in a furanose sugar. The thinner bonds at the top of the ring refer to the bonds as being farther away and the thicker bonds at the bottom of the ring refer to the end of the ring that is closer to the viewer.
=== Fischer projection ===

The Fischer projection is mostly used for linear monosaccharides. At any given carbon center, vertical bond lines are equivalent to stereochemical hashed markings, directed away from the observer, while horizontal lines are equivalent to wedges, pointing toward the observer. The projection is unrealistic, as a saccharide would never adopt this multiply eclipsed conformation. Nonetheless, the Fischer projection is a simple way of depicting multiple sequential stereocenters that does not require or imply any knowledge of actual conformation. A Fischer projection will restrict a 3-D molecule to 2-D, and therefore, there are limitations to changing the configuration of the chiral centers. Fischer projections are used to determine the R and S configuration on a chiral carbon and it is done using the Cahn Ingold Prelog rules. It is a convenient way to represent and distinguish between enantiomers and diastereomers.
== Limitations ==

A structural formula is a simplified model that cannot represent certain aspects of chemical structures. For example, formalized bonding may not be applicable to dynamic systems such as delocalized bonds. Aromaticity is such a case and relies on convention to represent the bonding. Different styles of structural formulas may represent aromaticity in different ways, leading to different depictions of the same chemical compound. Another example is formal double bonds where the electron density is spread outside the formal bond, leading to partial double bond character and slow inter-conversion at room temperature. For all dynamic effects, temperature will affect the inter-conversion rates and may change how the structure should be represented. There is no explicit temperature associated with a structural formula, although many assume that it would be standard temperature.

<doc id="191987" wikidata="Q1519270" url="?curid=191987" title="Retributive justice">
<text>Retributive justice is a legal concept whereby the criminal offender receives punishment proportional or similar to the crime. As opposed to revenge, retribution—and thus retributive justice—is not personal, is directed only at wrongdoing, has inherent limits, involves no pleasure at the suffering of others (i.e., &quot;schadenfreude&quot;, sadism), and employs procedural standards. Retributive justice contrasts with other purposes of punishment such as deterrence (prevention of future crimes), exile (prevention of opportunity) and rehabilitation of the offender.

The concept is found in most world cultures and in many ancient texts. Classical texts advocating the retributive view include Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Legibus&quot; (1st century BC), Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Science of Right&quot; (1790), and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; (1821). The presence of retributive justice in ancient Jewish culture is shown by its mention in the law of Moses, which refers to the punishments of &quot;life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot&quot; as also attested in the Code of Hammurabi. Documents assert similar values in other cultures, though the judgment of whether a particular punishment is appropriately severe can vary greatly across cultures and individuals in accord with circumstance.

==Purposes==
Some purposes of official retribution include:
* To channel the retributive sentiments of the public into the political and legal systems. The intent is to deter people from resorting to lynchings, blood feuds, and other forms of vigilante self-help.
* To promote social solidarity through participation in the act of punishing, under the theory that &quot;the society that slays together stays together.&quot;
* To prevent a situation in which a citizen who would have preferred to obey the law as part of his civic responsibility decides that he would be a fool to not violate it, when so many others are getting away with lawlessness that the point of his obedience is mostly defeated.
* To punish an offender.
* To compensate victims in proportion to the crime.

==History==

In all ancient legal systems, retribution for wrongdoing took precedence over the enforcement of rights. A sense of natural law demanded that a criminal should be punished with similar loss and pain as they inflicted on their victim. Therefore, the concept of &quot;lex talionis&quot; (an eye for an eye) was common in ancient law. The Code of Hammurabi includes the oldest extent example of &quot;lex talionis&quot;, and the Hebrew Bible also includes a commandment: (law of &#x27;measure for measure&#x27;). The Roman lawyer and philosopher Cicero proposed &quot;let the punishment fit the offence&quot; (), giving examples of violence being punished by death, fines being imposed on those convicted of greed etc.

In the 19th century, the philosopher Immanuel Kant argued that retribution is the only legitimate form of punishment the court can prescribe:

Kant regarded punishment as a matter of justice, which must be carried out by the state for the sake of the law, not for the sake of the criminal or the victim. He argues that if the guilty are not punished, justice is not done and if justice is not done, then the idea of law itself is undermined.

One of the reasons for the abandonment of retribution by many legal systems in the 20th century was the abandonment of the concept of personal autonomy, which had become discredited. While retributive justice is usually considered as a cornerstone of criminal punishment, it has been shown that it also plays a role in private law.

== Principles ==
According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, retributive justice is committed to three principles:
* &quot;Those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts, paradigmatically serious crimes, morally deserve to suffer a proportionate punishment.&quot;
* It is &quot;intrinsically morally good—good without reference to any other goods that might arise—if some legitimate punisher gives [those who commit certain kinds of wrongful acts] the punishment they deserve.&quot;
* &quot;It is morally impermissible intentionally to punish the innocent or to inflict disproportionately large punishments on wrongdoers.&quot;

=== Proportionality ===
Proportionality requires that the level of punishment be related to the severity of the offending behaviour. An accurate reading of the biblical phrase &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; in Exodus and Leviticus is said to be: &quot;&quot;only&quot; one eye for one eye&quot;, or &quot;an eye in place of an eye.&quot; However, this does not mean that the punishment has to be &quot;equivalent&quot; to the crime. A retributive system must punish severe crimes more harshly than minor crimes, but retributivists differ about how harsh or soft the system should be overall. The crime&#x27;s level of severity can be determined in multiple ways. Severity can be determined by the amount of harm, unfair advantage or the moral imbalance that the crime caused.

Traditionally, philosophers of punishment have contrasted retributivism with utilitarianism. For utilitarians, punishment is forward-looking, justified by a purported ability to achieve future social benefits, such as crime reduction. For retributionists, punishment is backward-looking, justified by the crime that has already been committed. Therefore, punishment is carried out to atone for the damage already done.

==Subtypes==
Retributive justice is of two distinct types. The classical definition embraces the idea that the amount of punishment must be proportionate to the amount of harm caused by the offence. A more recent version advocated by philosopher Michael Davis asserts that the amount of punishment must be proportionate to the amount of unfair advantage gained by the wrongdoer. Davis introduced this version of retributive justice in the early 1980s, at a time when retributive justice was resurging within the philosophy of law community, perhaps due to the failings of reform theory in prior decades.

A retributive justice system&#x27;s assessment of blameworthiness (or lack thereof) can either justify punishment or serve merely to limit the punishments society imposes for other reasons.

==Criticisms==
Many jurisdictions that adopt retributive justice, especially in the United States, use mandatory sentencing, where judges impose a penalty for a crime within the range set by the law. However, judges have limited discretion to consider mitigating factors, leading to lesser penalties under certain circumstances.

When the punishment involves a fine, the theory does not allow the financial position of an offender to be considered, leading to situations in which a poor individual and a millionaire could be forced to pay the same amount. Such a fine would be punitive for the poor offender while insignificant for the millionaire. Instead of pure retribution, many jurisdictions use variants such as the European Union&#x27;s emphasis on punitive equality, which base the amount of a fine not just on the offense but also on the offender&#x27;s income, salary, and ability to pay. Consequently, in 2002, a senior Finnish executive at Nokia was given a fine of €116,000 (US$103,000) on a traffic ticket issued for driving in a zone, based on his income of €14 million (US $12.5 million) per year. Similarly, a Finnish businessman was required to pay €54,000 based on his yearly income of €6.5 million, making the fine equally punitive as a typical €200 (US$246) fine for the same offense would have been had it been issued to a Finn earning an average salary. The retributive theory&#x27;s lack of consideration of the perpetrator&#x27;s and victim&#x27;s status has led many jurisdictions to move away from it in various ways, including punitive equality and taking into consideration the status and wealth, or lack of status and wealth, of an offender and their consequent ability to both pay fines and defend themselves effectively in court.

One critique of some concepts of just deserts is that they are primitive, emphasizing social harm rather than the character and culpability of offenders, e.g., California&#x27;s 1976 statute calling for &quot;terms proportionate to the seriousness of the offense with provision for uniformity in the sentences of offenders committing the same offense under similar circumstances.&quot; More generally, prioritizing justice for the public over crime control goals has come under criticism as attributable more to the relative ease of writing sentencing guidelines as crime tariffs (as opposed to describing the appropriate influence of situational and personal characteristics on punishment) than to any sound arguments about penological theory.

==Alternatives==
Traditional alternatives to retributive justice have been exile and shunning. In pre-modern societies such sentences were often the equivalent of the death penalty as individuals would find it impossible to survive without the support and protection of the society that they had wronged.

Modern alternatives to retributive measures include utilitarian justice, psychiatric imprisonment, restorative justice and transformative justice. A general overview of criminal justice puts each of these ideals in context.

One libertarian approach to this issue argues that full restitution (in the broad, rather than technical legal, sense) is compatible with both retributivism and a utilitarian degree of deterrence.

<text>Arthur Joseph Griffith (; 31 March 1871 – 12 August 1922) was an Irish writer, newspaper editor and politician who founded the political party Sinn Féin. He led the Irish delegation at the negotiations that produced the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, and served as the president of Dáil Éireann from January 1922 until his death later in August.

After a short spell in South Africa, Griffith founded and edited the Irish nationalist newspaper &quot;The United Irishman&quot; in 1899. In 1904, he wrote &quot;The Resurrection of Hungary: A Parallel for Ireland&quot;, which advocated the withdrawal of Irish members from the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the setting up of the institutions of government at home in Ireland, a policy that became known as (ourselves). On 28 November 1905, he presented &quot;The Sinn Féin Policy&quot; at the first annual convention of his organisation, the National Council; the occasion is marked as the founding date of the Sinn Féin party. Griffith took over as president of Sinn Féin in 1911, but at that time the organisation was still small.

Griffith was arrested following the Easter Rising of 1916, despite not having taken any part in it. On his release, he worked to build up Sinn Féin, which won a string of by-election victories. At the party&#x27;s (annual convention) in October 1917, Sinn Féin became an unambiguously republican party, and Griffith resigned the presidency in favour of the 1916 leader Éamon de Valera, becoming vice-president instead. Griffith was elected as an MP for East Cavan in a by-election in June 1918, and re-elected in the 1918 general election, when Sinn Féin won a huge electoral victory over the Irish Parliamentary Party and, refusing to take their seats at Westminster, set up their own constituent assembly, Dáil Éireann.

In the Dáil, Griffith served as Minister for Home Affairs from 1919 to 1921, and Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1921 to 1922. In September 1921, he was appointed chairman of the Irish delegation to negotiate a treaty with the British government. After months of negotiations, he and the other four delegates signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created the Irish Free State, but not as a republic. This led to a split in the Dáil. After the Treaty was narrowly approved by the Dáil, de Valera resigned as president and Griffith was elected in his place. The split led to the Irish Civil War. Griffith died suddenly in August 1922, two months after the outbreak of that war.

==Family and early life==
Arthur Joseph Griffith was born at 61 Upper Dominick Street, Dublin on 31 March 1871, of distant Welsh lineage. His great-great-grandfather, William Griffith of Drws-y-coed Uchaf, Rhyd-ddu, Caernarvonshire (1719-1782), was a farmer and supporter of the Moravian Church cause. His great grandfather, Griffith Griffith (b. 1789), emigrated first to the United States and then to Ireland, where some of his sisters had settled in Dublin among the Moravian community there. A Roman Catholic, Griffith was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers. He worked for a time as a printer before joining the Gaelic League, which was aimed at promoting the restoration of the Irish language.

His father had been a printer on &quot;The Nation&quot; newspaper — Griffith was one of several employees locked out in the early 1890s due to a dispute with a new owner of the paper. The young Griffith was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). Later in life he came to feel that violence would not be the best way to achieve the independence of Ireland. He felt that passive resistance was the safer and more certain way of defeating the British. He initially supported Parnell&#x27;s political views but then decided that Parnell&#x27;s political outlook was not what he thought was best for Ireland. Griffith visited South Africa from 1896 to 1898. In South Africa, Griffith supported the Boers in their campaign against British expansionism and was a supporter of Paul Kruger.

In 1899, on returning to Dublin, Griffith co-founded the weekly &quot;United Irishman&quot; newspaper with his associate William Rooney, who died in 1901. On 24 November 1910, Griffith married Maud Sheehan, after a six-year engagement; they had a son and a daughter.

Griffith&#x27;s fierce criticism of the Irish Parliamentary Party&#x27;s alliance with the British Liberal Party was heavily influenced by the anti-Liberal rhetoric of Young Irelander John Mitchel. Griffith supported the Limerick boycott, advocating shunning Jewish-owned businesses in the city. Griffith also supported movements seeking national independence from the British Empire in Egypt and India, and wrote a highly-critical description of the British government action at Matabele. He opposed the policies of James Larkin, but worked with James Connolly, who was a nationalist as well as a socialist.

In September 1900, he established an organisation called &quot;Cumann na nGaedheal&quot; (&quot;Society of the Gaels&quot;), to unite advanced nationalist and separatist groups and clubs. In 1903, he set up the National Council, to campaign against the visit to Ireland of King Edward VII and his consort Alexandra of Denmark. In 1907, that organisation merged with the Sinn Féin League, which itself had been formed from an amalgamation of Cumann na nGaedheal and the Dungannon Clubs, to form what would become Sinn Féin.

In 1906, after the &quot;United Irishman&quot; journal collapsed because of a libel suit, Griffith re-founded it under the title &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;. It briefly became a daily in 1909 and survived until its suppression by the British government in 1914, after which Griffith became editor of the new nationalist journal, &quot;Nationality&quot;.

==Foundation of Sinn Féin==
Most historians opt for 28 November 1905 as a founding date because it was on this date that Griffith first presented his &#x27;Sinn Féin Policy&#x27;. In his writings, Griffith declared that the Act of Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1800 was illegal and that, consequently, the Anglo-Irish dual monarchy that existed under Grattan&#x27;s Parliament and the so-called &quot;Constitution of 1782&quot; were still in effect. Its first president was Edward Martyn.

The fundamental principles of abstentionism on which Sinn Féin was founded were outlined in an article published in 1904, by Griffith called &quot;The Resurrection of Hungary&quot;, in which, notes how in 1867 Hungary went from being &quot;part&quot; of the Austrian Empire to a separate co-equal kingdom in Austria-Hungary. Though not a monarchist himself, Griffith advocated such an approach for the Anglo-Irish relationship, namely that Ireland should become a separate kingdom alongside Great Britain, the two forming a dual monarchy with a shared monarch but separate governments, as it was thought this solution would be more palatable to the British. This was similar to the policy of Henry Grattan a century earlier. However, this idea was never really embraced by later separatist leaders, especially Michael Collins, and never came to anything, although Kevin O&#x27;Higgins toyed with the idea as a means of ending partition, shortly before his assassination in 1927.

Griffith sought to combine elements of Parnellism with the traditional separatist approach; he saw himself not as a leader but as providing a strategy which a new leader might follow. Central to his strategy was parliamentary abstention: the belief that Irish MPs should refuse to attend the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster, but should instead establish a separate Irish parliament (with an administrative system based on local government) in Dublin.

Griffith was a staunch economic nationalist, he argued that nationalism was central to the fostering of economic growth. He often cited the works of German economist Friedrich List.

In February 1908, Sinn Féin unsuccessfully contested a by-election in North Leitrim, where the sitting MP, one Charles Dolan of Manorhamilton, County Leitrim, had defected to Sinn Féin. At this time Sinn Féin was being infiltrated by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, who saw it as a vehicle for their aims; it had several local Councillors (mostly in Dublin, including W. T. Cosgrave) and contained a dissident wing grouped from 1910 around the monthly periodical called &quot;Irish Freedom&quot;. The IRB members argued that the aim of dual monarchism should be replaced by republicanism and that Griffith was excessively inclined to compromise with conservative elements (notably in his pro-employer position during the 1913–1914 Dublin Lockout when he saw the syndicalism of James Larkin as aimed at crippling Irish industry for Great Britain&#x27;s benefit).

In 1911, he helped to found the Proportional Representation Society of Ireland, believing that proportional representation would help to prevent animosity between unionists and nationalists in an independent Ireland.

==1916 Rising==
In 1916, rebels seized and took over a number of key locations in Dublin, in what became known as the Easter Rising. After its defeat, it was widely described both by British politicians and the Irish and British media as the &quot;Sinn Féin rebellion&quot;, even though Sinn Féin had very limited involvement. One day after the rebellion began Griffith cycled across Dublin and met with the leader of the Irish Volunteers, Eoin MacNeill asking him (unsuccessfully) to mobilize the Volunteers across the nation. Griffith was detained, being released from Reading Gaol at the end of 1916. When in 1917, surviving leaders of the rebellion were released from gaol (or escaped) they joined Sinn Féin &quot;en masse&quot;, using it as a vehicle for the advancement of the republic. The result was a bitter clash between those original members who backed Griffith&#x27;s concept of an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy and the new members, under Éamon de Valera, who wanted to achieve a republic. Matters almost led to a split at the party&#x27;s Ard Fheis (conference) in October 1917.

In a compromise, it was decided to seek to establish a republic initially, then allow the people to decide whether they wanted a republic or a monarchy, subject to the condition that no member of Britain&#x27;s royal house could sit on any prospective Irish throne. At that Ard Fheis, Griffith resigned the presidency of Sinn Féin in favour of de Valera; he and Fr. Michael O&#x27;Flanagan were elected Vice-Presidents. The leaders of the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) sought a rapprochement with Griffith over the British threat of conscription, which both parties condemned, but Griffith refused unless the IPP embraced his more radical and subversive ideals, a suggestion which John Dillon, a leader of the IPP rubbished as unrealistic, although it would ultimately mean the defeat and dissolution of the IPP after the election in December 1918.

==War of Independence==

In May 1918, along with Éamon de Valera and 72 other Sinn Féiners, Griffith was arrested on the pretext of involvement in the fictitious German Plot. Griffith spent ten months interned in HM Prison Gloucester, being released on 6 March 1919. Fr. O&#x27;Flanagan was left as Acting-President of Sinn Féin. Griffith was put forward as a Sinn Féin candidate for the East Cavan by-election on 20 June 1918. Under the slogan &quot;Put him in to get him out,&quot; and was elected. and held the seat when Sinn Féin subsequently routed the Irish Parliamentary Party at the 1918 general election with a commitment of abstentionism from the British House of Commons. Griffith was returned for both East Cavan and Tyrone North West.

Sinn Féin&#x27;s MPs set up an Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann and declared independence for the Irish Republic; the Irish War of Independence followed almost immediately. The dominant leaders in the Dáil included Éamon de Valera, President of Dáil Éireann (1919–21), President of the Republic (1921–1922), and Michael Collins, Minister for Finance, head of the IRB and the Irish Republican Army&#x27;s Director of Intelligence.

During de Valera&#x27;s absence in the United States (1919–21) Griffith served as Acting President and gave regular press interviews. He was arrested at his house at 3 am, on 26 November 1920, and later jailed, Fr. O&#x27;Flanagan again taking over as acting leader until de Valera returned from America on 23 December. Griffith was to spend the next seven months in Dublin&#x27;s Mountjoy Prison. He was released on 30 June 1921 as peace moves got underway.

In Ireland, a general election was held on 24 May 1921 and Griffith, while still in prison, headed the poll in the contested constituency of Fermanagh and Tyrone, and was returned unopposed for Cavan. On 26 August 1921, Griffith was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the new Irish cabinet.

==Treaty negotiations and death==

In September 1921, de Valera, President of the Republic, asked Griffith to head the delegation of Irish plenipotentiaries to negotiate with the British government. The delegates set up Headquarters in Hans Place, London. After nearly two months of negotiations, on 5 December, the delegates decided in a private conversation in their headquarters to sign the Treaty and recommended it to the Dáil; negotiations closed at 2.20 a.m. on 6 December 1921. Griffith was the member of the treaty delegation most supportive of its eventual outcome, a compromise based on dominion status, rather than a republic. Griffith was content for an independent Irish State to remain within the British Empire or British Commonwealth as it soon would become. The Treaty was ratified by the Dáil by 64 votes to 57 on 7 January 1922. On 9 January, de Valera stood down as president and sought re-election by the Dáil, which he lost by a vote of 60 to 58. Griffith then succeeded de Valera as President of Dáil Éireann. A second ratification of the Treaty by the House of Commons of Southern Ireland followed shortly afterwards. Griffith was, however, to a great extent merely a figurehead as President of the Second Dáil.

Suffering from overwork and strain after the long and difficult negotiations with the British government (Griffith attended 41 of the 42 provisional government meetings held between 23 June and 30 July), and the work involved in establishing the Free State government, he entered St. Vincent&#x27;s Nursing Home, Leeson Street, Dublin, during the first week of August 1922, following an acute attack of tonsillitis. He was confined to a room in St Vincent&#x27;s by his doctors, who had observed signs of what they thought might be a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but it was difficult to keep him quiet, and he resumed his daily work in the government building. He had been about to leave for his office shortly before 10 a.m. on 12 August 1922, when he paused to retie his shoelace and fell down unconscious. He regained consciousness but collapsed again with blood coming from his mouth. Three doctors rendered assistance but to no avail. Fr John Lee of the Marist Fathers administered extreme unction, and Griffith died as the priest recited the concluding prayer. The cause of death, cerebral haemorrhage, was also reported as being due to heart failure. He died at the age of 51, ten days before Michael Collins&#x27; death in an ambush in County Cork. He was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery four days later.

==Posthumous commemoration==

The historian Diarmaid Ferriter considers that, though he had founded Sinn Féin, Griffith was &#x27;quickly airbrushed&#x27; from Irish history. His widow had to beg his former colleagues for a pension, saying that he &#x27;had made them all&#x27;. She considered that his grave plot was too modest and threatened to exhume his body. Only in 1968 was a plaque fixed on his former Clontarf home on St Lawrence Road.

Griffith Barracks which is now Griffith College Dublin on South Circular Road, Dublin, Griffith Avenue in North Dublin, Griffith Park in Drumcondra and Arthur Griffith Park in Lucan, County Dublin are named after him. An obelisk erected in 1950 in the grounds of Leinster House commemorates Griffith, as well as Michael Collins and Kevin O&#x27;Higgins.

==Views on race==
===Views on Jews===
As editor of the &quot;United Irishman&quot;, Griffith took an &quot;Anti-Dreyfusard&quot; line, writing in 1899 to defend the conviction of &quot;the Jew traitor&quot; Dreyfus; accusing the Dublin press of being &quot;almost all Jew rags&quot;; and decrying

Other editorials in Griffith&#x27;s United Irishman that year expressed concern about a conspiracy where &quot;&quot;the Jew capitalist has got a grip on the lying &quot;Press of Civilization&quot; from Vienna to New York and further&quot;&quot;, and concluded &quot;we know that all Jews are pretty sure to be traitors if they get the chance.&quot; In late 1899 The United Irishman published an article by Griffith that stated: &quot;I have in former years often declared that the Three Evil Influences of the century were the Pirate, the Freemason, and the Jew.&quot; The antisemitism found in the pages of the United Irishman during Griffth&#x27;s editorial tenure has been credited with shaping various aspects of Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, especially in the &quot;Cyclops&quot; episode.

In 1904, a piece in the paper voiced support for the Limerick boycott, a boycott of Jewish businesses in Limerick organised by a local priest, declaring that

Griffith was apparently unaware that the Jews of Limerick had little or no involvement in moneylending or similar practices. The &quot;United Irishman&quot; also published articles by Oliver St. John Gogarty that contained antisemitic sentiments, which were common in the Ireland of the time.

During this time an article in the United Irishman also expressed positive views towards Zionism; while

and excluded from this criticism was

From 1904 until his death, Griffith wrote virtually nothing which could be construed as antisemitic. Historian Colum Kenny writes that Griffith&#x27;s &quot;thinking developed&quot; which is shown by a &quot;radical shift&quot; in his journalism. Already in 1903, he had endorsed the Temperance–Labour Councillor Albert L. Altman, a Jew, for election to Dublin Corporation. In 1909, he wrote a favourable article in &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; on the Jewish contribution to European civilisation, and in &quot;Nationality&quot; in 1915, he railed against the Irish Parliamentary Party for saying that Jews should be barred from public office. Griffith&#x27;s publication &#x27;Scissors and Paste&#x27; published three separate articles sympathetic to Jewish victims of Eastern European pogroms and in 1915 his &#x27;Nationality&#x27; published a piece which defended English Jew Matthew Nathan - &quot;We do not know of one Nationalist Irishman who objects to Sir Matthew Nathan because of the religion he professes, or who holds the creed that an Irish Jew should be ineligible for any office he was competent to fill in an Irish government&quot;.

Griffith was a close friend of Jewish solicitor Michael Noyk, who defended many IRA members in courts martial during the Irish War of Independence, and served as an official in the First Dáil Department of Finance and as a Dáil Court judge during the war. Other Jewish Friends included Dr Edward Lipman, Jacob Elyan and Dr Bethel Solomons. Noyk and Solomons were among a group of friends who purchased a house for Griffith when he married.

===Views on other races===

Griffith held racist views towards Black people; in a preface he authored for the 1913 edition of John Mitchel&#x27;s &quot;Jail Journal&quot;, Griffith argued that &quot;no excuses were needed for an Irish Nationalist declining to hold the Negro his peer in right&quot;.

However while in South Africa, he opposed the exploitation of blacks by whites and he expressed appreciation that the Russo-Japanese War which led to a Russian defeat had destroyed &quot;the prestige of the white face&quot; in India. Meanwhile Griffith&#x27;s newspapers, &quot;United Irishman&quot; and &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;, both produced sympathetic coverage of Indian nationalists. Griffith was particularly interested in India&#x27;s Swadeshi movement.

<text>Pudding is a type of food which can either be a dessert served after the main meal or a savoury (salty or sweet and spicy) dish, served as part of the main meal.

In the United States, &quot;pudding&quot; means a sweet, milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards, instant custards or a mousse, often commercially set using cornstarch, gelatin or similar coagulating agent. The modern American meaning of pudding as dessert has evolved from the original almost exclusive use of the term to describe savoury dishes, specifically those created using a process similar to that used for sausages, in which meat and other ingredients in mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents. 

In the United Kingdom, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries, the word &quot;pudding&quot; is used to describe sweet and savoury dishes. Savoury puddings include Yorkshire pudding, black pudding, suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding. Unless qualified, however, pudding usually means dessert and in the United Kingdom, &quot;pudding&quot; is used as a synonym for dessert. Puddings made for dessert can be boiled and steamed puddings, baked puddings, bread puddings, batter puddings, milk puddings or even jellies.

In some Commonwealth countries these puddings are known as custards (or curds) if they are egg-thickened, as blancmange if starch-thickened, and as jelly if gelatin-based. Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as bread pudding and rice pudding, although typically these names derive from their origin as British dishes.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pudding&quot; is believed to come from the French , which may derive from the Latin botellus, meaning &quot;small sausage&quot;, referring to encased meats used in medieval European puddings. Another proposed etymology is from the West German &#x27;pud&#x27; meaning &#x27;to swell&#x27;.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; the word &quot;pudding&quot; dates to the 13th century. It refers to the entrails or stomach of a sheep, pig or other animal stuffed with meat, offal, suet, oatmeal and seasonings. By the 1500s the word was used to refer to the guts or entrails or the contents of other people&#x27;s stomachs especially when pierced with a sword, as in battle. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; describes puddings also as &#x27;a boiled, steamed or baked dish made with various sweet (or sometimes) savoury ingredients added to the mixture, typically including milk, eggs, and flour (or other starchy ingredients such as suet, rice, semolina, etc.), enclosed within a crust made from such a mixture&#x27;.

==Savoury and sweet==

=== Savoury puddings ===
The modern usage of the word &quot;pudding&quot; to mean a dessert has evolved from the almost exclusive use of the term to describe a savoury dish, specifically those created using a process similar to sausages, where meat and other ingredients in a mostly liquid form are encased and then steamed or boiled to set the contents. The most famous examples still surviving are black pudding and haggis. Other savoury dishes include suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding. Boiled or steamed pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the Royal Navy during the 18th and 19th centuries; pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of flour and suet were employed.

=== Dessert puddings ===
 Commonwealth dessert puddings are rich, fairly homogeneous starch- or dairy-based desserts such as rice pudding or steamed cake mixtures such as treacle sponge pudding (with or without the addition of ingredients such as dried fruits as in a Christmas pudding).

In the United States and some parts of Canada, &quot;pudding&quot; characteristically denotes a sweet milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based custards, instant custards or a mousse, often commercially set using cornstarch, tapioca, gelatin, or similar coagulating agent such as the Jell-O brand line of products. In Commonwealth countries (other than some Canadian regions), these foods are known as custards (or curds) if they are egg-thickened, blancmange if starch-thickened, and jelly if gelatin-based. Pudding may also refer to other dishes such as bread pudding and rice pudding in North America, although typically these names derive from their origin as British dishes.

==History==
One of the first documented mentions of pudding can be found in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; where a blood pudding roasted in a pig&#x27;s stomach is described. This original meaning of a pudding as a sausage is retained in black pudding, which is a blood sausage originating in the United Kingdom and Ireland made from pork or beef blood, with pork fat or beef suet, and a cereal.

Another early documented recipe for pudding is a reference to asida is found in a tenth century Arabic cookbook by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq called &quot;Kitab al-Ṭabīḫ&quot; (, &quot;The Book of Dishes&quot;). It was described as a thick pudding of dates cooked with clarified butter (&quot;samn&quot;). A recipe for asida was also mentioned in an anonymous Hispano-Muslim cookbook dating to the 13th century. In the 13th and 14th centuries, in the mountainous region of the Rif along the Mediterranean coast of Morocco, flour made from lightly grilled barley was used in place of wheat flour. A recipe for asida that adds argan seed oil was documented by Leo Africanus (c. 1465–1550), the Arab explorer known as Hasan al-Wazan in the Arab world. According to the French scholar Maxime Rodinson, asida were typical foods among the Bedouin of pre-Islamic and, probably, later times.

In the United Kingdom and some of the Commonwealth countries, the word &quot;pudding&quot; can be used to describe both sweet and savoury dishes. Unless qualified, however, the term in everyday usage typically denotes a dessert; in the United Kingdom, &quot;pudding&quot; is used as a synonym for a dessert course.

Puddings had their &#x27;real heyday...&#x27;, according to food historian Annie Gray, &#x27;...from the seventeenth century onward&#x27;. It is argued that &#x27;the future of the boiled suet pudding as one of England&#x27;s national dishes was assured only when the pudding cloth came into use&#x27; and although puddings boiled in cloths may have been mentioned in the medieval era one of the earliest mentions is in 1617 in a recipe for Cambridge pudding, a pudding cloth is indicated; &#x27;throw your pudding in, being tied in a fair cloth; when it is boiled enough, cut it in the midst, and so serve it in&#x27;.

The pudding cloth is said, according to food historian C. Anne Wilson, to have revolutionised puddings. &#x27;The invention of the pudding-cloth or bag finally severed the link between puddings and animal guts. Puddings could now be made at any time, and they became a regular part of the daily fare of almost all classes. Recipes for them proliferated.&#x27;

== Types ==
===Baked, steamed, and boiled puddings===
The original pudding was formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or other binder such as butter, flour, cereal, eggs, and/or suet, resulting in a solid mass. These puddings are baked, steamed, or boiled. Depending on its ingredients, such a pudding may be served as a part of the main course or as a dessert.

Steamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings. These may be sweet or savoury and include such dishes as steak and kidney pudding.

====Dessert====


===Creamy puddings===

The second and newer type of pudding consists of sugar, milk, and a thickening agent such as cornstarch, gelatin, eggs, rice or tapioca to create a sweet, creamy dessert. These puddings are made either by simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven, often in a bain-marie. These puddings are easily scorched on the fire, which is why a double boiler is often used; microwave ovens are also now often used to avoid this problem and to reduce stirring.

Creamy puddings are typically served chilled, but a few, such as zabaglione and rice pudding, may be served warm. Instant puddings do not require boiling and can therefore be prepared more quickly.

This pudding terminology is common in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands, whilst in Britain, egg-thickened puddings are considered custards and starch-thickened puddings called blancmange.
Table cream is a dessert, similar to blancmange. The dessert was popularized by English manufacturer Symington&#x27;s Ltd in the early 20th century. It is still produced under the Symington&#x27;s brand name, but no longer made by the original company.

==Cultural references==
* The proverb, &quot;&quot;, dates back to at least the 14th century. The phrase is widely attributed to the Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes in his novel &quot;The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote.&quot; The phrase is often incorrectly stated as &quot;the proof is in the pudding.&quot;
* &quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot;, (1894) written by Mark Twain, reflects the term&#x27;s use as a metaphor for someone with the mind of a fool.
* &quot;The Magic Pudding&quot; is a classic Australian children&#x27;s novel first published in 1918, written and illustrated by author Norman Lindsay. It tells of a bad-tempered, anthropomorphic pudding named Albert who, no matter how often he is eaten, always reforms in order to be eaten again. He is owned by three companions who must defend him against Pudding Thieves who want Albert for themselves.
* Pink Floyd&#x27;s Another Brick in the Wall, part 2 (1979) ends with the voice of a Scottish-accented schoolmaster, actor Alex McAvoy (1928–2005) shouting, &quot;If you don&#x27;t eat your meat, you can&#x27;t have any pudding! How can you have any pudding if you don&#x27;t eat your meat?!&quot; over and over again.
* A website dedicated to the dessert, online since the mid-1990s and consisting only of a low-quality image of it, became famous in Brazil for its humorous and longstanding nature. In 2015, it was hacked by the Islamic State.

<doc id="191999" wikidata="Q1179296" url="?curid=191999" title="Tangent vector">
<text>In mathematics, a tangent vector is a vector that is tangent to a curve or surface at a given point. Tangent vectors are described in the differential geometry of curves in the context of curves in R&quot;n&quot;. More generally, tangent vectors are elements of a tangent space of a differentiable manifold. Tangent vectors can also be described in terms of germs. Formally, a tangent vector at the point formula_1 is a linear derivation of the algebra defined by the set of germs at formula_1.

== Motivation ==
Before proceeding to a general definition of the tangent vector, we discuss its use in calculus and its tensor properties.

=== Calculus ===
Let formula_3 be a parametric smooth curve. The tangent vector is given by formula_4 provided it exists and provided formula_5, where we have used a prime instead of the usual dot to indicate differentiation with respect to parameter . The unit tangent vector is given by
formula_6

==== Example ====
Given the curve
formula_7
in formula_8, the unit tangent vector at formula_9 is given by
formula_10

=== Contravariance ===
If formula_3 is given parametrically in the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional coordinate system (here we have used superscripts as an index instead of the usual subscript) by formula_12 or
formula_13
then the tangent vector field formula_14 is given by
formula_15
Under a change of coordinates
formula_16
the tangent vector formula_17 in the -coordinate system is given by
formula_18
where we have used the Einstein summation convention. Therefore, a tangent vector of a smooth curve will transform as a contravariant tensor of order one under a change of coordinates.

== Definition ==
Let formula_19 be a differentiable function and let formula_20 be a vector in formula_21. We define the directional derivative in the formula_20 direction at a point formula_23 by
formula_24
The tangent vector at the point formula_25 may then be defined as
formula_26

== Properties ==
Let formula_27 be differentiable functions, let formula_28 be tangent vectors in formula_29 at formula_30, and let formula_31. Then
#formula_32
#formula_33
#formula_34

==Tangent vector on manifolds==
Let formula_35 be a differentiable manifold and let formula_36 be the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on formula_35. Then the tangent vector to formula_35 at a point formula_1 in the manifold is given by the derivation formula_40 which shall be linear — i.e., for any formula_41 and formula_31 we have
:formula_43
Note that the derivation will by definition have the Leibniz property
:formula_44

<doc id="192005" wikidata="Q219861" url="?curid=192005" title="Paul Wolfowitz">
<text>Paul Dundes Wolfowitz (born December 22, 1943, in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York City) is an American political scientist and diplomat who served as the 10th President of the World Bank, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, and dean of Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University. He is currently a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

Having proposed a plan to invade Iraq in 2001, Wolfowitz was an early advocate of the Iraq War and has widely been described as an architect of the war. In the aftermath of the insurgency and civil war that followed the invasion, Wolfowitz denied influencing policy on Iraq and disclaimed responsibility. He is a leading neoconservative.

In 2005, he left the Pentagon to serve as president of the World Bank only to resign after two years over a scandal involving allegations he used his position to help World Bank staffer Shaha Riza to whom he was romantically linked. A Reuters report described his tenure there as &quot;a protracted battle over his stewardship, prompted by his involvement in a high-paying promotion for his companion&quot;. Wolfowitz is the only World Bank president to have resigned over a scandal.

==Early life ==
The second child of Jacob Wolfowitz (b. Warsaw; 1910–1981) and Lillian Dundes, Paul Wolfowitz was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York, into a Polish Jewish immigrant family, and grew up mainly in Ithaca, New York, where his father was a professor of statistical theory at Cornell University. As a student at Cornell, Paul Wolfowitz was profoundly impacted by John Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot; (1946), leading him to become &quot;a soft-spoken former aspiring-mathematician-turned-policymaker ... [whose] world views ... were forged by family history and in the halls of academia rather than in the jungles of Vietnam or the corridors of Congress ... [Paul Wolfowitz] ... escaped Poland after World War I. The rest of his father&#x27;s family perished in the Holocaust.&quot;

In the mid-1960s, while Paul was an undergraduate student at Cornell residing at the Cornell Branch of the Telluride Association, he met Clare Selgin, who later became an anthropologist. They married in 1968, had three children and lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland. They separated in 1999, and, according to some sources, became legally separated in 2001 and divorced in 2002.

In late 1999, Wolfowitz began dating Shaha Riza. Their relationship led to controversy later, during his presidency of the World Bank Group.

Wolfowitz speaks five languages in addition to English: Arabic, French, German, Hebrew, and Indonesian. He was reportedly the model for a minor character named Philip Gorman in Saul Bellow&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;Ravelstein&quot;.

=== Education ===
Wolfowitz entered Cornell University in 1961. He lived in the Telluride House in 1962 and 1963, while philosophy professor Allan Bloom served as a faculty mentor living in the house. In August 1963, he and his mother participated in the civil-rights march on Washington organized by A. Philip Randolph Wolfowitz was a member of the Quill and Dagger society. Wolfowitz graduated in 1965 with a B.A. in mathematics. Against his father&#x27;s wishes, Wolfowitz decided to go to graduate school to study political science. Wolfowitz would later say that &quot;one of the things that ultimately led me to leave mathematics and go into political science was thinking I could prevent nuclear war.&quot;

In 1972, Wolfowitz received a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Chicago, writing his doctoral dissertation on &quot;Nuclear Proliferation in the Middle East: The Politics and Economics of Proposals for Nuclear Desalting&quot;. At the University of Chicago, Wolfowitz took two courses with Leo Strauss. He completed his dissertation under Albert Wohlstetter. Wohlstetter became Wolfowitz&#x27;s &quot;mentor&quot;. In the words of Wolfowitz&#x27;s future colleague Richard Perle: &quot;Paul thinks the way Albert thinks.&quot; In the summer of 1969, Wohlstetter arranged for Wolfowitz, Perle and Peter Wilson to join the Committee to Maintain a Prudent Defense Policy which was set up by Cold War architects Paul Nitze and Dean Acheson.

While finishing his dissertation, Wolfowitz taught in the department of political science at Yale University from 1970 to 1972; one of his students was future colleague Scooter Libby.

==Career==

===Arms Control and Disarmament Agency===

In the 1970s, Wolfowitz and Perle served as aides to proto-neoconservative Democratic Senator Henry M. Jackson. A Cold War liberal, Jackson supported higher military spending and a hard line against the Soviet Union alongside more traditional Democratic causes, such as social welfare programs, civil rights, and labor unions.

In 1972, US President Richard Nixon, under pressure from Senator Jackson, dismissed the head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and replaced him with Fred Ikle. Ikle brought in a new team that included Wolfowitz. While at ACDA, Wolfowitz wrote research papers and drafted testimony, as he had previously done at the Committee to Maintain a Prudent Defense Policy. He traveled with Ikle to strategic arms limitations talks in Paris and other European cities. He also helped dissuade South Korea from reprocessing plutonium that could be diverted into a clandestine weapons program.

Under President Gerald Ford, the American intelligence agencies came under attack over their annually published National Intelligence Estimate. According to James Mann, &quot;The underlying issue was whether the C.I.A. and other agencies were underestimating the threat from the Soviet Union, either by intentionally tailoring intelligence to support Kissinger&#x27;s policy of détente or by simply failing to give enough weight to darker interpretations of Soviet intentions.&quot; Attempting to counter these claims, Director of Central Intelligence George H. W. Bush formed a committee of anti-Communist experts, headed by Richard Pipes, to reassess the raw data. Based on the recommendation of Perle, Pipes picked Wolfowitz for this committee, which was later called Team B.

The team&#x27;s 1976 report, which was leaked to the press, stated that &quot;all the evidence points to an undeviating Soviet commitment to what is euphemistically called the &#x27;worldwide triumph of socialism,&#x27; but in fact connotes global Soviet hegemony&quot;, highlighting a number of key areas where they believed the government&#x27;s intelligence analysts had failed. According to Jack Davis, Wolfowitz observed later:
The B-Team demonstrated that it was possible to construct a sharply different view of Soviet motivation from the consensus view of the [intelligence] analysts and one that provided a much closer fit to the Soviets&#x27; observed behavior (and also provided a much better forecast of subsequent behavior up to and through the invasion of Afghanistan). The formal presentation of the competing views in a session out at [CIA headquarters in] Langley also made clear that the enormous experience and expertise of the B-Team as a group were formidable.&quot;
Team B&#x27;s conclusions have faced criticism. They have been called &quot;worst-case analysis&quot;, ignoring the &quot;political, demographic, and economic rot&quot; already eating away at the Soviet system. Wolfowitz reportedly had a central role in Team B, mostly focused on analyzing the role that medium-range missiles played in Soviet military strategy.

In 1978, Wolfowitz was investigated by the FBI for providing intelligence to an Israeli government official while he was still an employee at ACDA. He was accused of handing over a classified document, via an AIPAC intermediary, which detailed the proposed sale of U.S. weapons to an Arab government. An inquiry was launched, but the probe was later dropped and Wolfowitz was never charged.

===Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Regional Programs===
In 1977, during the Carter administration, Wolfowitz moved to the Pentagon. He was US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Regional Programs for the US Defense Department, under US Secretary of Defense Harold Brown.

In 1980, Wolfowitz resigned from the Pentagon and became a visiting professor at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University. Shortly after, he joined the Republican Party. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;He said it was not he who changed his political philosophy so much as the Democratic Party, which abandoned the hard-headed internationalism of Harry Truman, Kennedy and Jackson.&quot;

===State Department Director of Policy Planning===
Following the 1980 election of President Ronald Reagan, the new National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen formed the administration&#x27;s foreign policy advisory team. Allen initially rejected Wolfowitz&#x27;s appointment but following discussions, instigated by former colleague John Lehman, Allen offered Wolfowitz the position of Director of Policy Planning at the Department of State.

President Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy was heavily influenced by the Kirkpatrick Doctrine, as outlined in a 1979 article in &quot;Commentary&quot; by Jeane Kirkpatrick entitled &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;.
Although most governments in the world are, as they always have been, autocracies of one kind or another, no idea holds greater sway in the mind of educated Americans than the belief that it is possible to democratize governments, anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances ... (But) decades, if not centuries, are normally required for people to acquire the necessary disciplines and habits.

Wolfowitz broke from this official line by denouncing Saddam Hussein of Iraq at a time when Donald Rumsfeld was offering the dictator support in his conflict with Iran. James Mann points out: &quot;quite a few neo-conservatives, like Wolfowitz, believed strongly in democratic ideals; they had taken from the philosopher Leo Strauss the notion that there is a moral duty to oppose a leader who is a &#x27;tyrant. Other areas where Wolfowitz disagreed with the administration was in his opposition to attempts to open up dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and to the sale of Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft to Saudi Arabia. &quot;In both instances,&quot; according to Mann, &quot;Wolfowitz demonstrated himself to be one of the strongest supporters of Israel in the Reagan administration.&quot;

Mann stresses: &quot;It was on China that Wolfowitz launched his boldest challenge to the established order.&quot; After Nixon and Kissinger had gone to China in the early 1970s, US policy was to make concessions to China as an essential Cold War ally. The Chinese were now pushing for the US to end arms sales to Taiwan, and Wolfowitz used the Chinese incentive as an opportunity to undermine Kissinger&#x27;s foreign policy toward China. Instead, Wolfowitz advocated a unilateralist policy, claiming that the US did not need China&#x27;s assistance but that the Chinese needed the US to protect them against the far more-likely prospect of a Soviet invasion of the Chinese mainland. Wolfowitz soon came into conflict with Secretary of State Alexander Haig, who had been Kissinger&#x27;s assistant at the time of the visits to China. On March 30, 1982, &quot;The New York Times&quot; predicted that &quot;Paul D. Wolfowitz, the director of policy planning ... will be replaced&quot;, because &quot;Mr. Haig found Mr. Wolfowitz too theoretical.&quot; Instead, on June 25, 1982, Haig was replaced by George Shultz as US Secretary of State, and Wolfowitz was promoted.

===State Department Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs===
In 1982, Secretary of State Shultz appointed Wolfowitz as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.

Jeane Kirkpatrick, on a visit to the Philippines, was welcomed by the dictator Ferdinand Marcos who quoted heavily from her 1979 &quot;Commentary&quot; article &quot;Dictatorships and Double Standards&quot;; although Kirkpatrick had been forced to speak out in favor of democracy, the article continued to influence Reagan&#x27;s policy toward Marcos. Following the assassination of Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983, many within the Reagan administration including the President himself began to fear that the Philippines could fall to the communists and the US military would lose its strongholds at Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Station. Wolfowitz tried to change the administration&#x27;s policy, stating in an April 15, 1985, article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that &quot;The best antidote to Communism is democracy.&quot; Wolfowitz and his assistant Lewis Libby made trips to Manila where they called for democratic reforms and met with non-communist opposition leaders.

Mann points out that &quot;the Reagan administration&#x27;s decision to support democratic government in the Philippines had been hesitant, messy, crisis-driven and skewed by the desire to do what was necessary to protect the American military installations.&quot; Following massive street protests, Marcos fled the country on a US Air Force plane and the US recognized the government of Corazón Aquino.

===Ambassador to the Republic of Indonesia===
From 1986 to 1989, during the military-backed government of President Suharto, Wolfowitz was the US Ambassador to the Republic of Indonesia.

According to Peter J. Boyer, Wolfowitz&#x27;s appointment to Indonesia was not an immediately obvious match. He was a Jew representing America in the largest Muslim republic in the world, an advocate of democracy in Suharto&#x27;s dictatorship. But Wolfowitz&#x27;s tenure as Ambassador was a notable success, largely because, in essence, he went native. With tutoring help from his driver, he learned the language, and hurled himself into the culture. He attended academic seminars, climbed volcanoes, and toured the neighborhoods of Jakarta.

Sipress and Nakashima reported that &quot;Wolfowitz&#x27;s colleagues and friends, both Indonesian and American&quot; pointed to the &quot;U.S. envoy&#x27;s quiet pursuit of political and economic reforms in Indonesia.&quot; Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a foreign policy adviser to B. J. Habibie, Suharto&#x27;s successor as head of state (1998–99), stated &quot;that Wolfowitz was a competent and popular envoy.&quot; But &quot;he never intervened to push human rights or stand up to corruption.&quot;

Officials involved in the USAID program during Wolfowitz&#x27;s tenure told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he &quot;took a keen personal interest in development, including health care, agriculture and private sector expansion&quot; and that &quot;Wolfowitz canceled food assistance to the Indonesian government out of concern that Suharto&#x27;s family, which had an ownership interest in the country&#x27;s only flour mill, was indirectly benefiting.&quot;

In &quot;The Tragedy of Suharto&quot;, published in May 1998, in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Wolfowitz states:
Although it is fashionable to blame all of Asia&#x27;s present problems on corruption and the failure of Asian values, it is at bottom a case of a bubble bursting, of too many imprudent lenders chasing too many incautious borrowers. But the greed of Mr. Suharto&#x27;s children ensured that their father would take the lion&#x27;s share of the blame for Indonesia&#x27;s financial collapse. The Suharto children&#x27;s favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would be a political crisis as well. That he allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, is all the more mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.

After the 2002 Bali bombing, on October 18, 2002, then Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz observed that &quot;the reason the terrorists are successful in Indonesia is because the Suharto regime fell and the methods that were used to suppress them are gone.&quot;

===Undersecretary of Defense for Policy===
From 1989 to 1993, Wolfowitz served in the administration of George H. W. Bush as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, under then US Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. During the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Wolfowitz&#x27;s team coordinated and reviewed military strategy, raising $50 billion in allied financial support for the operation. Wolfowitz was present with Cheney, Colin Powell and others, on February 27, 1991, at the meeting with the President where it was decided that the troops should be demobilized.

On February 25, 1998, Wolfowitz testified before a congressional committee that he thought that &quot;the best opportunity to overthrow Saddam was, unfortunately, lost in the month right after the war.&quot; Wolfowitz added that he was horrified in March as &quot;Saddam Hussein flew helicopters that slaughtered the people in the south and in the north who were rising up against him, while American fighter pilots flew overhead, desperately eager to shoot down those helicopters, and not allowed to do so.&quot; During that hearing, he also stated: &quot;Some people might say—and I think I would sympathise with this view—that perhaps if we had delayed the ceasefire by a few more days, we might have got rid of Saddam Hussein.&quot;

After the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Wolfowitz and his then-assistant Scooter Libby wrote the &quot;Defense Planning Guidance of 1992&quot; (DPG), which came to be known as the Wolfowitz Doctrine, to &quot;set the nation&#x27;s direction for the next century.&quot; As military strategist Andrew Bacevich described the doctrine:

Before this classified document was fully vetted by the White House, it was leaked to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which made it front-page news. The draft DPG announced that it had become the &quot;first objective&quot; of U.S. policy &quot;to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival.&quot; With an eye toward &quot;deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role,&quot; the United States would maintain unquestioned military superiority and, if necessary, employ force unilaterally. As window dressing, allies might be nice, but the United States no longer considered them necessary.

At that time, the official administration line was &quot;containment&quot;, and the contents of Wolfowitz&#x27;s plan calling for &quot;preemption&quot; and &quot;unilateralism&quot; was opposed by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell and President Bush. Defense Secretary Cheney produced a revised plan released in 1992. Many of the ideas in the Wolfowitz Doctrine later became part of the Bush Doctrine. He left the government after the 1992 election.

===Johns Hopkins University===

From 1994 to 2001, Wolfowitz served as Professor of International Relations and Dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University. He was instrumental in adding more than $75 million to the university&#x27;s endowment, developing an international finance concentration as part of the curriculum, and combining the various Asian studies programs into one department. He also advised Bob Dole on foreign policy during his 1996 US presidential election campaign, which was managed by Donald Rumsfeld.

According to Kampfner, &quot;Wolfowitz used his perch at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies as a test-bed for a new conservative world vision.&quot; Wolfowitz was associated with the Project for the New American Century (PNAC); he signed both the PNAC&#x27;s June 3, 1997 &quot;Statement of Principles&quot;, and its January 26, 1998, open letter to President Bill Clinton.

In February 1998, Wolfowitz testified before a congressional hearing, stating that the current administration lacked the sense of purpose to &quot;liberate ourselves, our friends and allies in the region, and the Iraqi people themselves from the menace of Saddam Hussein.&quot;

In September 2000, the PNAC produced a 90-page report entitled &quot;Rebuilding America&#x27;s Defenses: Strategies, Forces and Resources for a New Century&quot;, advocating the redeployment of US troops in permanent bases in strategic locations throughout the world where they can be ready to act to protect US interests abroad. During the 2000 US presidential election campaign, Wolfowitz served as a foreign policy advisor to George W. Bush as part of the group led by Condoleezza Rice calling itself The Vulcans.

===Deputy Secretary of Defense===


From 2001 to 2005, during the George W. Bush administration, Wolfowitz served as U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense reporting to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.

The September 11 attacks in 2001 were a turning point in administration policy, as Wolfowitz later explained: &quot;9/11 really was a wake up call and that if we take proper advantage of this opportunity to prevent the future terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction that it will have been an extremely valuable wake up call,&quot; adding: &quot;if we say our only problem was to respond to 9/11, and we wait until somebody hits us with nuclear weapons before we take that kind of threat seriously, we will have made a very big mistake.&quot;

In the first emergency meeting of the National Security Council on the day of the attacks, Rumsfeld asked, &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t we go against Iraq, not just al-Qaeda?&quot; with Wolfowitz adding that Iraq was a &quot;brittle, oppressive regime that might break easily—it was doable,&quot; and, according to John Kampfner, &quot;from that moment on, he and Wolfowitz used every available opportunity to press the case.&quot; The idea was initially rejected, at the behest of Secretary of State Colin Powell, but, according to Kampfner, &quot;Undeterred Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz held secret meetings about opening up a second front—against Saddam. Powell was excluded.&quot; In such meetings they created a policy that would later be dubbed the Bush Doctrine, centering on &quot;pre-emption&quot; and the war on Iraq, which the PNAC had advocated in their earlier letters.

After the September 11 attacks, the US invaded Afghanistan to fight Al-Qaeda, which had orchestrated the attack. The invasion of Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001. On October 10, 2001, George Robertson, then Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, went to the Pentagon to offer NATO troops, planes and ships to assist. Wolfowitz rebuffed the offer, saying: &quot;We can do everything we need to.&quot; Wolfowitz later announced publicly, according to Kampfner, &quot;that &#x27;allies, coalitions and diplomacy&#x27; were of little immediate concern.&quot;

Ten months later, on January 15, 2003, with hostilities still continuing, Wolfowitz made a fifteen-hour visit to the Afghan capital, Kabul, and met with the new president Hamid Karzai. Wolfowitz stated, &quot;We&#x27;re clearly moving into a different phase, where our priority in Afghanistan is increasingly going to be stability and reconstruction. There&#x27;s no way to go too fast. Faster is better.&quot; Despite the promises, according to Hersh, &quot;little effort to provide the military and economic resources&quot; necessary for reconstruction was made. This criticism would also re-occur after the 2003 invasion of Iraq later that year.

On April 16, 2002, the National Solidarity Rally for Israel was called in Washington to promote US support and collaboration with Israel. Wolfowitz was the sole representative of the Bush administration to attend, speaking alongside Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. As reported by the BBC, Wolfowitz told the crowd that US President George W. Bush &quot;wants you to know that he stands in solidarity with you&quot;. Sharon Samber and Matthew E. Berger reported for Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) that Wolfowitz continued by saying that &quot;Innocent Palestinians are suffering and dying as well. It is critical that we recognize and acknowledge that fact,&quot; before being booed and drowned out by chants of &quot;No more Arafat.&quot;

Following the invasion of Afghanistan the Bush administration had started to plan for the next stage of the War on Terror. According to John Kampfner, &quot;Emboldened by their experience in Afghanistan, they saw the opportunity to root out hostile regimes in the Middle East and to implant very American interpretations of democracy and free markets, from Iraq to Iran and Saudi Arabia. Wolfowitz epitomized this view.&quot; Wolfowitz &quot;saw a liberated Iraq as both paradigm and linchpin for future interventions.&quot; The 2003 invasion of Iraq began on March 19.

Prior to the invasion, Wolfowitz actively championed it, as he later stated: &quot;For reasons that have a lot to do with the U.S. government bureaucracy we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason&quot;

The job of finding WMD and providing justification for the attack would fall to the intelligence services, but, according to Kampfner, &quot;Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz believed that, while the established security services had a role, they were too bureaucratic and too traditional in their thinking.&quot; As a result, &quot;they set up what came to be known as the &#x27;cabal&#x27;, a cell of eight or nine analysts in a new Office of Special Plans (OSP) based in the U.S. Defense Department.&quot; According to an unnamed Pentagon source quoted by Hersh, the OSP &quot;was created in order to find evidence of what Wolfowitz and his boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, believed to be true—that Saddam Hussein had close ties to Al Qaeda, and that Iraq had an enormous arsenal of chemical, biological, and possibly even nuclear weapons that threatened the region and, potentially, the United States.&quot;

Within months of being set up, the OSP &quot;rivaled both the CIA and the Pentagon&#x27;s Defense Intelligence Agency, the DIA, as President Bush&#x27;s main source of intelligence regarding Iraq&#x27;s possible possession of weapons of mass destruction and connection with Al Qaeda.&quot; Hersh explains that the OSP &quot;relied on data gathered by other intelligence agencies and also on information provided by the Iraqi National Congress, or INC, the exile group headed by Ahmad Chalabi.&quot; According to Kampfner, the CIA had ended its funding of the INC &quot;in the mid-1990s when doubts were cast about Chalabi&#x27;s reliability.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;as the administration geared up for conflict with Saddam, Chalabi was welcomed in the inner sanctum of the Pentagon&quot; under the auspices of the OSP, and &quot;Wolfowitz did not see fit to challenge any of Chalabi&#x27;s information.&quot; The actions of the OSP have led to accusation of the Bush administration &quot;fixing intelligence to support policy&quot; with the aim of influencing Congress in its use of the War Powers Act.

Kampfner outlined Wolfowitz&#x27;s strategy for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which &quot;envisaged the use of air support and the occupation of southern Iraq with ground troops, to install a new government run by Ahmed Chalabi&#x27;s Iraqi National Congress.&quot; Wolfowitz believed that the operation would require minimal troop deployment, Hersh explains, because &quot;any show of force would immediately trigger a revolt against Saddam within Iraq, and that it would quickly expand.&quot; The financial expenditure would be kept low, Kampfner observes, if &quot;under the plan American troops would seize the oil fields around Basra, in the South, and sell the oil to finance the opposition.&quot;

On March 27, 2003, Wolfowitz told the House Appropriations Committee that oil revenue earned by Iraq alone would pay for Iraq&#x27;s reconstruction after the Iraq war; he testified his &quot;rough recollection&quot; was: &quot;The oil revenues of that country could bring between $50 and $100 billion over the course of the next two or three years. Now, there are a lot of claims on that money, but ... We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction and relatively soon.&quot; By October of that year, &quot;Lawrence Di Rita, the Pentagon&#x27;s chief spokesman, said &#x27;prewar estimates that may be borne out in fact are likelier to be more lucky than smart.&#x27; [He] added that earlier estimates and statements by Mr. Wolfowitz and others &#x27;oozed with uncertainty.&#x27;&quot; Di Rita&#x27;s comments came as a much less optimistic secret Pentagon study—which had been complete at the time of Wolfowitz&#x27;s testimony—was coming to public light, and when actual production results in Iraq were coinciding with those projected in the less optimistic Pentagon study.

During Wolfowitz&#x27;s pre-war testimony before Congress, he dismissed General Eric K. Shinseki&#x27;s estimates of the size of the post war occupation force which would be needed. General Shinseki testified to the US Senate Armed Services Committee on February 25, 2003, that &quot;something in the order of several hundred thousand soldiers&quot; would probably be required for postwar Iraq. By contrast, Wolfowitz estimated that fewer than 100,000 troops would be necessary in Iraq. Two days after Shinseki testified, Wolfowitz said to the House Budget Committee on February 27, 2003:There has been a good deal of comment—some of it quite outlandish—about what our postwar requirements might be in Iraq. Some of the higher end predictions we have been hearing recently, such as the notion that it will take several hundred thousand U.S. troops to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq, are wildly off the mark. It is hard to conceive that it would take more forces to provide stability in post-Saddam Iraq than it would take to conduct the war itself and to secure the surrender of Saddam&#x27;s security forces and his army—hard to imagine.

On October 26, 2003, while in Baghdad staying at the Al-Rashid Hotel Wolfowitz narrowly escaped an attack when six rockets hit the floors below his room. Army Lt. Col. Charles H. Buehring was killed and seventeen other soldiers were wounded. Wolfowitz and his DOD staffers escaped unharmed and returned to the United States on October 28, 2003.

===President of the World Bank===

In March 2005, Wolfowitz was nominated to be president of the World Bank by US President George W. Bush. Criticism of his nomination appeared in the media. Nobel Laureate in Economics and former chief economist for the World Bank Joseph Stiglitz said: &quot;&#x27;The World Bank will once again become a hate figure. This could bring street protests and violence across the developing world.&#x27;&quot; In a speech at the U.N. Economic and Social Council, economist Jeffrey Sachs also opposed Wolfowitz: &quot;It&#x27;s time for other candidates to come forward that have experience in development. This is a position on which hundreds of millions of people depend for their lives ... Let&#x27;s have a proper leadership of professionalism.&quot;

In the US, there was some praise for the nomination. An editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated: Mr. Wolfowitz is willing to speak the truth to power ... he saw earlier than most, and spoke publicly about, the need for dictators to plan democratic transitions. It is the world&#x27;s dictators who are the chief causes of world poverty. If anyone can stand up to the Robert Mugabes of the world, it must be the man who stood up to Saddam Hussein.He was confirmed and became president on June 1, 2005. He soon attended the 31st G8 summit to discuss issues of global climate change and the economic development in Africa. When this meeting was interrupted by the July 7, 2005 London bombings, Wolfowitz was present with other world leaders at the press conference given by British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Several of Wolfowitz&#x27;s initial appointments at the bank proved controversial, including two US nationals (Robin Cleveland and Kevin Kellems) formerly with the Bush administration, whom he appointed as close advisors with $250,000 tax-free contracts. Another appointee, Juan José Daboub, faced criticism, including from his colleagues, for attempting to bring policies on climate change and family planning towards a more conservative position.

Wolfowitz gave special emphasis to two particular issues. Identifying Sub-Saharan Africa as the region most challenged to improve living standards, he traveled widely in the region. He also made clear his focus on fighting corruption. Several aspects of the latter program raised controversy. Overturning the names produced by a formal search process, he appointed a figure linked to the US Republican party to head the bank&#x27;s internal watchdog. Member countries worried that Wolfowitz&#x27;s willingness to suspend lending to countries on grounds of corruption was vulnerable to selective application in line with US foreign policy interests. In a debate on the proposed Governance and Anti-Corruption Strategy at the bank&#x27;s 2006 Annual Meetings, shareholders directed Wolfowitz to undertake extensive consultations and revise the strategy to show how objective measures of corruption would be incorporated into decisions and how the shareholders&#x27; representatives on the bank&#x27;s Board would play a key role. Following the consultations and revisions, the Board approved a revised strategy in spring 2007.

==Controversies==

===Wolfowitz&#x27;s relationship with Shaha Riza===

After President George W. Bush nominated Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank, journalists reported that Wolfowitz was involved in a relationship with World Bank Senior Communications Officer (and Acting Manager of External Affairs) for the Middle East and North Africa Regional Office Shaha Ali Riza. According to Richard Leiby, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Riza is &quot;an Oxford-educated British citizen, was born in Tunisia and grew up in Saudi Arabia. She is known for her expertise on women&#x27;s rights and has been listed on the bank&#x27;s Web site as a media contact for Iraq reconstruction issues.&quot; According to Leiby and Linton Weeks, in their essay &quot;In the Shadow of a Scandal&quot;, Riza&#x27;s employment at the World Bank predated Wolfowitz&#x27;s nomination as Bank president: &quot;Riza started at the World Bank as a consultant in July 1997 and became a full-time employee in 1999&quot;; and the relationship between Riza and Wolfowitz pre-dated it as well: In the early 1990s, Riza joined the National Endowment for Democracy and is credited there with development of the organization&#x27;s Middle East program. Wolfowitz was on the endowment&#x27;s board—which is how Riza first met him, according to Turkish journalist Cengiz Candar, a friend of the couple. &quot;Shaha was married at the time and Paul was married,&quot; Candar recalled, and it wasn&#x27;t until late 1999—after Riza divorced and Wolfowitz had separated from his wife of 30 years, Clare Selgin Wolfowitz—that the couple began dating.&quot;

When Wolfowitz was considered for head of the CIA after the 2000 election, Clare Wolfowitz wrote President-elect George Bush a letter telling him that her husband&#x27;s relationship with a foreign national—Riza—posed a national security risk. It has been reported that Scooter Libby intercepted the letter. Sidney Blumenthal also reported on the letter Clare Wolfowitz wrote:
This embittered letter remained a closely guarded secret, although a former high official of the CIA told me about it. Chris Nelson also reported it on April 16 in his widely respected, nonpartisan foreign policy newsletter: &quot;A certain Ms. Riza was even then Wolfowitz&#x27;s true love. The problem for the CIA wasn&#x27;t just that she was a foreign national, although that was and is today an issue for anyone interested in CIA employment. The problem was that Wolfowitz was married to someone else, and that someone was really angry about it, and she found a way to bring her complaint directly to the President. So when we, with our characteristic innocence, put Wolfowitz on our short-list for CIA, we were instantly told, by a very, very, very senior Republican foreign policy operative, &#x27;I don&#x27;t think so.&#x27; &quot; The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of London also reported on his wife&#x27;s letter when Wolfowitz was appointed president of the World Bank in 2005.

According to the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot; on March 20, 2005, despite their cultural differences:Riza, an Arab feminist who confounds portrayals of Wolfowitz as a leader of a &quot;Zionist conspiracy&quot; of Jewish neoconservatives in Washington ... [and who] works as the bank&#x27;s senior gender co-ordinator for the Middle East and North Africa ... not only shares Wolfowitz&#x27;s passion for spreading democracy in the Arab world, but is said to have reinforced his determination to remove Saddam Hussein&#x27;s oppressive regime.The relationship created further controversy over Wolfowitz&#x27;s nomination to head the World Bank, because the bank&#x27;s ethics rules preclude sexual relationships between a manager and a staff member serving under that manager, even if one reports to the other only indirectly through a chain of supervision.

Wolfowitz initially proposed to the World Bank&#x27;s Ethics Committee that he recuse himself from personnel matters regarding Riza, but the committee rejected that proposal. Riza was &quot;seconded to the State Department&quot;, or placed on &quot;external assignment&quot;, assigned &quot;a job at the state department under Liz Cheney, the daughter of the vice-president, promoting democracy in the Middle East&quot;. She &quot;was also moved up to a managerial pay grade in compensation for the disruption to her career&quot;, resulting in a raise of over $60,000, as well as guarantees of future increases; &quot;The staff association claims that the pay rise was more than double the amount allowed under employee guidelines.&quot; A promotion and raise had been among the options suggested by a World Bank ethics committee that was set up to advise on the situation. According to Steven R. Weisman, however, in a report published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the then-current chair of the committee emphasized that he was not informed at the time of the details or extent of the present and future raises built into the agreement with Riza. Wolfowitz referred to the controversy concerning his relationship with Riza in a statement posted on the website of the World Bank at the time (April 12, 2007).

The affair resurfaced in headlines in 2011.

===Wolfowitz&#x27;s leadership of the World Bank Group===
In early 2007, Fox News published on a series of investigative stories on the World Bank, based in part on leaks of internal bank documents. On April 11, 2007, Reuters and Al Kamen in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, reported that Wolfowitz and the World Bank board had hired the Williams &amp; Connolly law firm to oversee an investigation into the leaking of internal bank documents to Fox News. Those reports cite an internal memo to the bank staff later posted on the internet, dated April 9, 2007, in which the World Bank&#x27;s general counsel, Ana Palacio, states that the bank&#x27;s legal staff was scrutinizing two articles by investigative reporter Richard Behar published on the website of Fox News on January 31 and March 27, 2007. A day after the second report published by Behar, on March 28, 2007, Kamen had disclosed that &quot;Bank records obtained by the Government Accountability Project&quot; documented pay raises in excess of Bank policies given to Shaha Riza.

On April 12, 2007, the London &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that, in a 2005 memorandum, Wolfowitz had personally directed the bank&#x27;s human resources chief to offer Riza a large pay rise and promotion, according to two anonymous sources who told the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that they had seen the memo. The memo was part of a package of 102 pages of documents released by the bank on April 14, 2007.

On April 14, 2007, after reviewing these documents, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; concluded that it was &quot;a potentially fatal blow&quot; to Wolfowitz. In contrast, Fox News concluded that the new documents might offer Wolfowitz a &quot;new lifeline&quot; in the scandal, because the bank&#x27;s ethics committee had launched a review of the Riza compensation case in early 2006 and concluded that it did not warrant any further attention by the committee.
Wolfowitz failed, on April 19, 2007, to attend a high-profile meeting and the controversy led to disruption at the World Bank when some employees wore blue ribbons &quot;in a display of defiance against his leadership.&quot;

World Bank Group&#x27;s board of executive directors and staffers complained also that Wolfowitz was imposing Bush administration policies to eliminate family planning from World Bank programs. According to Nicole Gaouette, in her report published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on April 19, 2007, Juan José Daboub—the managing director whom Wolfowitz had appointed who has also been criticized for overly-conservative policies concerning climate change and &quot;a Roman Catholic with ties to a conservative Salvadoran political party&quot;—repeatedly deleted references to family planning from World Bank proposals.

On May 14, 2007, the World Bank committee investigating the alleged ethics violations reported (in part):
* &quot;Mr. Wolfowitz&#x27;s contract requiring that he adhere to the Code of Conduct for board officials and that he avoid any conflict of interest, real or apparent, were violated&quot;;
* &quot;The salary increase Ms. Riza received at Mr. Wolfowitz&#x27;s direction was in excess of the range established by Rule 6.01&quot;;
* &quot;The ad hoc group concludes that in actuality, Mr Wolfowitz from the outset cast himself in opposition to the established rules of the institution&quot;; and
* &quot;He did not accept the bank&#x27;s policy on conflict of interest, so he sought to negotiate for himself a resolution different from that which would have applied to the staff he was selected to head.&quot;

Wolfowitz appeared before the World Bank Group&#x27;s board of executive directors to respond on May 15. Adams speculated that &quot;With Mr Wolfowitz so far refusing to step down, the board may need to take radical action to break the stalemate. Members have discussed a range of options, including sacking Mr Wolfowitz, issuing a vote of no confidence or reprimanding him. Some board members argue that a vote of no confidence would make it impossible for him to stay in the job.&quot; By Wednesday, May 16, 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reported that &quot;after six weeks of fighting efforts to oust him as president ... Wolfowitz began today to negotiate the terms of his possible resignation, in return for the bank dropping or softening the charge that he had engaged in misconduct ...&quot; After expressions from the Bush administration that it &quot;fully&quot; supported Wolfowitz as World Bank president and its urging a &quot;fair hearing&quot; for him, President Bush expressed &quot;regret&quot; at Wolfowitz&#x27;s impending resignation.

On May 17, 2007, the World Bank Group&#x27;s board of Executive Directors announced that Paul Wolfowitz would resign as World Bank Group president at the end of June 2007.

==Recent activities==
As a visiting scholar of the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, Wolfowitz has blogged for the group and appeared in group events. In 2011, he wrote columns that appeared in publications such as &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

Wolfowitz is a former steering committee member of the Bilderberg group.

In February 2013, Wolfowitz publicly supported legal recognition for same-sex marriage in an amicus brief submitted to the US Supreme Court.

In February 2015, Wolfowitz advised presidential candidate Jeb Bush.

In August 2016, Wolfowitz announced his intention to vote for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election, despite having &quot;serious reservations about her.&quot; However, in a December interview on Fox Business, Wolfowitz claimed that he did not in fact vote for Clinton.

In January 2017, Wolfowitz wrote an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting on a &quot;dissent cable&quot; that had been signed by 1,000 Foreign Service Officers criticizing President Trump&#x27;s executive action on immigration.

In February 2023, Wolfowitz was awarded Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon by President of the Republic of China Tsai Ing-wen.

<text>Christopher Darlington Morley (May 5, 1890 – March 28, 1957) was an American journalist, novelist, essayist and poet. He also produced stage productions for a few years and gave college lectures.

==Biography==
Morley was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. His father, Frank Morley, was a mathematics professor at Haverford College; his mother, Lilian Janet Bird, was a violinist who provided Christopher with much of his later love for literature and poetry.

In 1900, the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. In 1906 Christopher entered Haverford College, graduating in 1910 as valedictorian. He then went to New College, Oxford, for three years on a Rhodes scholarship, studying modern history.

In 1913 Morley completed his Oxford studies and moved to New York City, New York. On June 14, 1914, he married Helen Booth Fairchild, with whom he would have four children, including Louise Morley Cochrane. They first lived in Hempstead, and then in Queens Village. They then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in 1920 they made their final move to a house they called &quot;Green Escape&quot; in Roslyn Estates, New York. They remained there for the rest of his life. In 1936 he built a cabin at the rear of the property (&quot;The Knothole&quot;), which he maintained as his writing study from then on.

In 1951, Morley had a series of strokes, which greatly reduced his voluminous literary output. He died on March 28, 1957, and was buried in the Roslyn Cemetery in Nassau County, New York. After his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; published his message to his friends and readers:

This quote originally appeared in Morley&#x27;s column &quot;Brief Case; or, Every Man His Own Bartlett&quot; in &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, Nov. 6, 1948.

==Career==
Morley began writing while still in college. He edited &quot;The Haverfordian&quot; and contributed articles to that college publication. He provided scripts for and acted in the college&#x27;s drama program. He played on the cricket and soccer teams.

In Oxford a volume of Morley&#x27;s poems, &quot;The Eighth Sin&quot; (1912), was published. After graduating from Oxford, Morley began his literary career at Doubleday, working as publicist and publisher&#x27;s reader. In 1917, he got his start as an editor for &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; (1917–1918), then as a newspaper reporter and newspaper columnist in Philadelphia for the &quot;Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger&quot;.

Morley&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Parnassus on Wheels&quot;, appeared in 1917. The protagonist, traveling bookseller Roger Mifflin, appeared again in his second novel, &quot;The Haunted Bookshop&quot; in 1919.

In 1920, Morley returned to New York City to write a column (&quot;The Bowling Green&quot;) for the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;.
In 1922, a candid interview was seen nationwide in newspapers, part of a series called Humor&#x27;s Sober Side: How Humorists Get That Way. Other humorists interviewed in the same series included Will Rogers, Dorothy Parker, Don Marquis, Roy K. Moulton, Tom Sims, Tom Daly, and Ring Lardner.

Morley was one of the founders and a longtime contributing editor of the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;. A highly gregarious man, he was the mainstay of what he dubbed the &quot;Three Hours for Lunch Club&quot;. Out of enthusiasm for the Sherlock Holmes stories, he helped found the Baker Street Irregulars and wrote the introduction to the standard omnibus edition of &quot;The Complete Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

&quot;Kit&quot; wrote prefaces, introductions, or forewords for over fifty books. Many of these were posthumously collected as &quot;Prefaces without Books&quot;. A lion of literature, Morley was able in these essays to analyze subtleties within the Sherlock Holmes stories, for example, examining the influences of Doyle&#x27;s youthful love of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s writings upon the Holmes stories. But Morley goes much further, analyzing the Holmes stories as if they are historical artifacts. For examples, he peruses maps of the British sea coast to try to determine the location of Holmes&#x27; retirement bee-keeping, he tries to develop a floor plan for Holmes&#x27; Baker Street residence, and he conjectures about Watson&#x27;s love life.

Morley explained, &quot;Is it trivial or absurd to apply to these imaginary characters the same close attention which is the principle of the stories themselves?&quot; and &quot;There is a special and superior pleasure in reading anything so much more carefully than its author ever did.&quot;

He also wrote an introduction to the standard omnibus edition of &quot;The Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot; in 1936, although Morley called it an &quot;Introduction to Yourself as a Reader of Shakespeare&quot;. That year, he was appointed to revise and enlarge &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot; (11th edition in 1937 and 12th edition in 1948). He was one of the first judges for the Book of the Month Club, serving in that position until the early 1950s.

Author of more than 100 novels, books of essays, and volumes of poetry, Morley is probably best known today for his first two novels, &quot;Parnassus on Wheels&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Haunted Bookshop&quot; (1919), which remain in print. Barnes &amp; Noble published new editions of these works in 2009 as part of their &quot;Library of Essential Reading&quot; series. In 2018, Dover Publications published a new single volume edition containing both novels. Other well-known works include &quot;Thunder on the Left&quot; (1925) and the 1939 novel &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot;, which was made into an Academy Award-winning movie.

From 1928 to 1930, Morley and set designer Cleon Throckmorton co-produced theater productions (dramas) at two theaters they purchased and renovated in Hoboken, New Jersey, which they had &quot;deemed the last seacoast in Bohemia&quot;.

For most of Morley&#x27;s life, he lived in Roslyn Estates, Nassau County, Long Island, commuting to the city on the Long Island Rail Road, about which he wrote affectionately. In 1961, the 98-acre (40-hectare) Christopher Morley Park on Searingtown Road in Nassau County was named in his honor. This park preserves as a publicly available point of interest his studio, the &quot;Knothole&quot; (which was moved to the site after his death), along with his furniture and bookcases.

==Literary connections==
*Morley was a close friend of Don Marquis, author of the &quot;Archy and Mehitabel&quot; stories featuring the antics and commentary of a New York cockroach and a cat. In 1924 Morley and Marquis co-authored &quot;Pandora Lifts The Lid&quot;, a light novel about the well-to-do in the contemporary Hamptons. They are said to have written alternating chapters, each taking the plot forward from where the other had left off.
*Morley&#x27;s widow sold a collection of his personal papers and books to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin after his death.
*Morley helped to found The Baker Street Irregulars, dedicated to the study of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;.
*Morley edited two editions of &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;: 1937 (11th) and 1948 (12th).
*Morley&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot; was unusual for its time, as it openly discussed abortion. It became an instant best-seller, selling over one million copies.
*Morley&#x27;s brothers Felix and Frank were also Rhodes Scholars. Felix became President of Haverford College.
*In 1942, Morley wrote his own obituary for the biographical dictionary &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot;.
*Morley was at the center of a social group in Greenwich Village that hung out at his friend Frank Shay&#x27;s bookshop at 4 Christopher Street in the early 1920s.
*Morley&#x27;s selected poems are available as &quot;Bright Cages: Selected Poems And Translations From The Chinese&quot; by Christopher Morley, ed. Jon Bracker (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1965). The translations from the Chinese are actually a joke, explained to the public when the volumes by Morley containing them appeared: they are &quot;Chinese&quot; in nature, good-humored accounts: short, wise, often humorous. But they are not in any strict sense of the word, translations.

<text>Christian philosophy includes all philosophy carried out by Christians, or in relation to the religion of Christianity.
Christian philosophy emerged with the aim of reconciling science and faith, starting from natural rational explanations with the help of Christian revelation. Several thinkers such as Origen of Alexandria and Augustine believed that there was a harmonious relationship between science and faith, others such as Tertullian claimed that there was contradiction and others tried to differentiate them.

There are scholars who question the existence of a Christian philosophy itself. These claim that there is no originality in Christian thought and its concepts and ideas are inherited from Greek philosophy. Thus, Christian philosophy would protect philosophical thought, which would already be definitively elaborated by Greek philosophy.

However, Catholic scholars Philotheus Boehner and Étienne Gilson claim that Christian philosophy is not a simple repetition of ancient philosophy, although they owe to Greek science the knowledge developed by Plato, Aristotle and the Neo-Platonists. They even claim that in Christian philosophy, Greek culture survives in organic form.

==Historical aspects==
Christian philosophy began around the 3rd century. It arises through the movement of the Christian community called Patristics, which initially had as a main objective the defense of Christianity. As Christianity spread, patristic authors increasingly engaged with the philosophical schools of the hellenized Roman Empire, and ultimately learned from some aspects of these surrounding ideas how to better articulate Christianity&#x27;s own revelation of Jesus Christ as God incarnate and one with God the Father and God the Spirit. Many scholars consider Origen of Alexandria to be the first Christian teacher to fully present Christian philosophy and metaphysics as a stronger alternative to other schools (especially Platonism). See &quot;Origen Against Plato&quot; by Mark J. Edwards and the introduction to &quot;Origen: On First Principles&quot; translated and introduced by John Behr as two prominent examples of this history of a specifically Christian philosophy and metaphysics.

From the 11th century onwards, Christian philosophy was manifested through Scholasticism. This is the period of medieval philosophy that extended until the 15th century, as pointed out by T. Adão Lara. From the 16th century onwards, Christian philosophy, with its theories, started to coexist with independent scientific and philosophical theories.

The development of Christian ideas represents a break with the philosophy of the Greeks, bearing in mind that the starting point of Christian philosophy is the Christian religious message.

Lara divides Christian philosophy into three eras:
* Early philosophy: Patristics (2nd–7th centuries)
* Medieval philosophy: Scholastics (9th–13th centuries)
* Pre-modern philosophy (14th–15th centuries)

==Characteristics==
===Natural demonstration===

The philosophical starting point of Christian philosophy is logic, not excluding Christian theology. Although there is a relationship between theological doctrines and philosophical reflection in Christian philosophy, its reflections are strictly rational. On this way of seeing the two disciplines, if at least one of the premises of an argument is derived from revelation, the argument falls in the domain of theology; otherwise it falls into philosophy&#x27;s domain.

===Justification of truths of faith===
Fundamentally, Christian philosophical ideals are to make religious convictions rationally evident through natural reason. The Christian philosopher&#x27;s attitude is determined by faith in matters relating to cosmology and everyday life. Unlike the Secular philosopher, the Christian philosopher seeks conditions for the identification of eternal truth, being characterized by religiosity

There is criticism of Christian philosophy because the Christian religion is hegemonic at this time and centralizes the elaboration of all values. The coexistence of philosophy and religion is questioned, as philosophy itself is critical and religion founded on revelation and established dogmas. Lara believes that there was questioning and writings with philosophical characteristics in the Middle Ages, although religion and theology predominated. In this way it was established by dogmas, in some aspects, which did not prevent significant philosophical constructions.

===Tradition===
A Christian philosophy developed from predecessor philosophies. Justin is based on Greek philosophy, an academy in Augustine and Patristics. It is in the tradition of Christian philosophical thought or Judaism, from whom it was inherited from the Old Testament and more fundamentally in the Gospel message, which records or at the center of the message advocated by Christianity.

Scholasticism received influence from both Jewish philosophy and Islamic philosophy. This Christian Europe did not remain exclusively influenced by itself, but it suffered strong influences from other cultures.

===Systematizing view===
The &#x27;Divine Unity&#x27; (attempts) &#x27;intercedes&#x27; to systematically and comprehensively systematize the problems of &#x27;global/worldly&#x27; reality &#x27;on&#x27; a &#x27;cosmic-harmonic-balance&#x27; whole. There is a lack of creative &#x27;Divine Spirit&#x27;, which is compensated by the overall vision. Christian Revelation itself provides the Christian with an overview.

<doc id="192008" wikidata="Q5738" url="?curid=192008" title="Adolphe Thiers">
<text>Marie Joseph Louis Adolphe Thiers ( ; ; 15 April 17973 September 1877) was a French statesman and historian who served as President of France from 1871 to 1873. He was the second elected president and the first of the Third French Republic.

Thiers was a key figure in the July Revolution of 1830, which overthrew King Charles X in favor of the more liberal King Louis Philippe, and the Revolution of 1848, which overthrew the July Monarchy and established the Second French Republic. He served as a prime minister in 1836 and 1840, dedicated the Arc de Triomphe, and arranged the return to France of the remains of Napoleon from Saint-Helena. He was first a supporter, then a vocal opponent of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (who served from 1848 to 1852 as President of the Second Republic and then reigned as Emperor Napoleon III from 1852 to 1871). When Napoleon III seized power, Thiers was arrested and briefly expelled from France. He then returned and became an opponent of the government.

Following the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, which he opposed, Thiers was elected chief executive of the new French government and negotiated the end of the war. When the Paris Commune seized power in March 1871, Thiers gave the orders to the army for its suppression. At the age of seventy-four, he was named president of the Republic by the French National Assembly in August 1871. His chief accomplishment as president was to achieve the departure of German soldiers from most of French territory two years ahead of schedule. Opposed by the monarchists in the French National Assembly and the left wing of the republicans, he resigned on 24 May 1873, and was replaced as president by Patrice de MacMahon. When he died in 1877, his funeral became a major political event; the procession was led by two of the leaders of the republican movement, Victor Hugo and Léon Gambetta, who at the time of his death were his allies against the conservative monarchists.

Thiers was also a notable popular historian. He wrote the first large scale history of the French Revolution in 10 volumes, published 1823–1827. Historian Robert Tombs states it was, &quot;A bold political act during the Bourbon Restoration...and it formed part of an intellectual upsurge of liberals against the counter-revolutionary offensive of the Ultra Royalists.&quot; He also wrote a twenty-volume history of the Consulate and Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte (). In 1834, he was elected to the Académie Française.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Adolphe Thiers was born out of wedlock in Marseille on 15 April 1797, during the rule of the Directorate. His father, Pierre-Louis-Marie Thiers, was a businessman and occasional government official under Napoleon, who led a life of debauchery and was frequently in trouble with the law. On 13 May 1797, his previous wife having died 2 months prior, his father married his mother Marie-Madeleine Amic, with Adolphe thereby becoming a legitimate child, undergoing a baptism by a refractory priest. Nevertheless, the father abandoned Adolphe and his mother not long after. He showed no interest towards Adolphe, and only contacted him in 1825 when he was becoming famous in the Paris journalism scene, to ask him for money. Adolphe responded to the letter saying he feels love and duty only towards his mother, and that only if Pierre can prove he needs the money to stay alive and not for &quot;the most ignoble excesses&quot;, would he see what he can do.

His paternal grandfather, Louis-Charles Thiers, was an attorney in Aix-en-Provence, who moved to Marseille to become the guardian of the city archives, as well as secretary-general of the city administration, although he lost that post during the French Revolution. Thiers was of Greek ancestry on his maternal grandmother&#x27;s side; his grandfather Claude Amic left Marseille for Constantinople around 1750 to work for the Seymandi trading post, and while there married a Catholic Greek woman named Marie Lhomaka, whose paternal family originally hailed from Chios and claimed &quot;Frankish&quot; descent. Her father, Antoine Lhomaka, was a wealthy jeweler who supplied the Imperial Harem, and in 1722 accompanied Mehmet Efendi to Paris as a dragoman. Claude Amic later took his family to Marseille in 1770. His mother&#x27;s uncle, born Ange-Auguste Lhomaka, later converted to Islam, became known under the name &quot;Hadj Messaoud&quot; and moved to the Indies. Adolphe&#x27;s mother was also a first cousin of the poet André Chenier.

His mother, born in Bouc-Bel-Air, had little money, but Thiers was able to receive a good education thanks to financial aid from an aunt and a godmother. He won admission to a lycée of Marseille through a competitive examination, and then, with the help of his relatives, was able to enter the faculty of law in Aix-en-Provence in November 1815. While studying at the faculty of law he began his lifelong friendship with François Mignet. They both were admitted to the bar in 1818; Thiers made a precarious living as a lawyer for three years. Thiers, who showed a strong interest in literature, won an academic prize of five hundred francs for an essay on the Marquis de Vauvenargues. Nonetheless, he was unhappy with his life in Aix-en-Provence. He wrote to his friend Teulon, &quot;I am without fortune, without status, and without any hope of having either here.&quot; He decided to move to Paris and to try to make a career as a writer.

===Journalism===

In 1821, the 24-year-old Thiers moved to Paris with just 100 francs in his pocket. Thanks to his letters of recommendation, he was able to get a position as a secretary to the prominent philanthropist and social reformer, the Duke of La Rochefoucalt-Liancourt. He stayed only three months with the Duke, whose political views were more conservative than his own, and with whom he could see no rapid avenue for advancement. He was then introduced to Charles-Guillaume Étienne, the editor of the &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot;, the most influential political and literary journal in Paris at the time. The newspaper was the leading opposition journal against the royalist government; it had 44,000 subscribers, compared with just 12,800 subscribers for the royalist, or legitimist, press. He offered Etienne an essay on the political figure François Guizot, Thiers&#x27; future rival, which was original, polemical and aggressive, and caused a stir in Paris literary and political circles. Etienne commissioned Thiers as a regular contributor. At the same time that Thiers began writing, his friend from the law school in Aix, Mignet, was hired as a writer for another leading opposition journal, the &quot;Courier Français&quot;, and then worked for a major Paris book publisher. Within four months of his arrival in Paris, Thiers was one of the most-read journalists in the city.

He wrote about politics, art, literature, and history. His literary reputation introduced him into the most influential literary and political salons in Paris. He met Stendhal, the Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt, the famed banker Jacques Laffitte, the author and historian Prosper Mérimée, the painter François Gérard; he was the first journalist to write a glowing review for a young new painter, Eugène Delacroix. When a revolution broke out in Spain in 1822, he traveled as far as the Pyrenees to write about it. He soon collected and published a volume of his articles, the first on the Paris Salon of 1822, the second on his trip to the Pyrenees. He was very well paid by Johann Friedrich Cotta, the part-proprietor of the &quot;Constitutionnel&quot;. Most important for his future career, he was introduced to Talleyrand, the famous diplomat, who became his political guide and mentor. Under the tutelage of Talleyrand, Thiers became an active member of the circle of opponents of the Bourbon regime, which included the financier Lafitte and the Marquis de Lafayette.

===Historian===

Thiers began his celebrated &quot;Histoire de la Révolution française&quot;, which founded his literary reputation and boosted his political career. The first two volumes appeared in 1823, the last two (of ten) in 1827. The complete work of ten volumes sold ten thousand sets, an enormous number for the time. It went through four more editions, which earned him 57,000 francs (the equivalent of more than a million 1983 francs). The history of Thiers was particularly popular in liberal circles and among younger Parisians. It praised the principles, leaders and accomplishments of the 1789 Revolution (though not the later Terror), and condemned the monarchy, aristocracy and clergy for their inability to change. The book played a notable role in undermining the legitimacy of the Bourbon regime of Charles X, and bringing about the July Revolution of 1830.

The work was praised by the French authors Chateaubriand, Stendhal and Sainte-Beuve, was translated into English (1838) and Spanish (1889), and won him a seat in the Académie française in 1834. It was less appreciated by British critics, in large part because of his favorable view of the French Revolution and of Napoleon Bonaparte. The British historian Thomas Carlyle, who wrote his own history of the French Revolution, complained that it &quot;was far as possible from meriting its high reputation&quot;, though he admitted that Thiers is &quot;a brisk man in his way, and will tell you much if you know nothing&quot;. The historian George Saintsbury wrote in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911): &quot;Thiers&#x27; historical work is marked by extreme inaccuracy, by prejudice which passes the limits of accidental unfairness, and by an almost complete indifference to the merits as compared with the successes of his heroes.&quot;

===July Revolution (1830)===

A new King, Charles X, had come to the French throne in 1824 with a strong belief in the divine right of kings and the worthlessness of parliamentary government. Thiers had been planning a literary career, but in August 1829, when the King appointed the ultra-royalist, Polignac as his new prime minister, Thiers began to write increasingly fierce attacks on the royal government. In a celebrated article, he wrote that &quot;The King rules, but does not govern,&quot; and called for a constitutional monarchy. If the King did not accept it, he proposed simply changing the King, as the English had done in 1688. When the &quot;Constitutionel&quot; hesitated to publish some of his more energetic attacks on the government, Thiers, with Armand Carrel, Mignet, Stendhal and others, started a new opposition newspaper, the &quot;National&quot;, whose first issue appeared on 3 January 1830. The government responded by taking the newspaper to court, charging it with attacks on the person of the King and that of the royal family. It was fined three thousand francs. The writer Lamartine left a vivid description of Thiers, with whom he had dinner at this time: &quot;He spoke first; he spoke last; he hardly listened to the replies; but he spoke with an accuracy, with an audacity, with a fecundity of ideas, that excused his volubility of words from his lips. It was his spirit and heart which spoke...There was enough gunpowder in his nature to explode six governments.&quot;

In August 1829, Charles X had decided to show his authority over the unruly Chamber of Deputies, and named a fervent royalist, Jules de Polignac as his new prime minister. On 19 March 1830, he raised the temperature, warning that if the deputies put obstacles in his path, he would &quot;find the force to overcome them in my resolution to maintain the public peace, with the full confidence of the French and the love they have also shown toward their King.&quot; He also launched an overseas expedition for the conquest of Algeria, which he was certain would increase his popularity at home, and called for new elections, which he was certain he would win. The French flag was hoisted over Algiers on 5 July 1830, and new elections were held from 13 to 19 July. The elections were a disaster for the King; the opposition won 270 seats, against 145 supporters of the King. The opponents were, for the most part, not republicans; they simply wanted a constitutional monarchy. The King responded, however, on 25 July with new decrees dissolving the Chamber of Deputies, changing the election laws, and putting restrictions on the press. The King, confident in his popularity, neglected to put the army on alert or to bring in soldiers to maintain order.

Thiers reacted immediately and forcefully. On the front page of his newspaper, the &quot;National&quot;, he declared: &quot;The legal regime is over; that of force has begun; in the situation in which we are placed, obedience has ceased to be an obligation.&quot; He persuaded the editors of the other major liberal newspapers to publish a joint declaration of opposition, which was published on the morning of 27 July. Later that morning, the prefect of police arrived at the &quot;National&quot; with orders to put the newspaper out of business. He brought workers who seized key mechanical parts of the printing presses, and locked the building. As soon as the prefect left, the same workers who had locked the building and disabled the presses re-opened it and put the presses back into service. Anti-royalist demonstrations broke out in many parts of Paris. Thiers and his allies briefly left the city to avoid arrest, but soon came back. Thiers noticed that the anti-royalist demonstrators had attacked shops which had signs showing that they were patronized by Charles X, but not those which advertised they were patronized by the King&#x27;s cousin, Louis-Philippe, the Duke of Orleans, whose family had been sympathetic to the French Revolution. Without consulting with Louis-Philippe, whom he had never met, Thiers immediately had posters printed and put up around Paris declaring that the Duke of Orleans was a friend of the people, and he should take the crown.

With the painter Ary Scheffer, a friend of Louis-Philippe, he rode on horseback immediately to the Duke&#x27;s residence in Neuilly, but found that the Duke had left and was in hiding at another chateau in Raincy. Thiers talked instead to the Duke&#x27;s wife, Marie-Amélie, and his sister, Madame Adélaïde. Thiers explained that they wanted a representative monarchy and a new dynasty, and that everyone knew that Louis-Philippe was not ambitious and had not sought the crown for himself. Madame Adelaide agreed to take the proposition to the Duke. The Duke returned to Neuilly at ten in the evening and learned what had happened from his wife. He put on a tricolor ribbon, the symbol of the opposition, and rode to the Palais-Royal, where Thiers, the Marquis de Lafayette and Jacques Laffitte were waiting. Together, they persuaded him to take the throne and discussed how it would be done. That afternoon, they rode to the Hotel de Ville. Louis-Philippe, wrapped in a tricolor flag, was presented to the huge and cheering crowd in front of the Hotel de Ville by LaFayette. King Charles X withdrew his proposed new government and offered to negotiate, but it was too late. He and his son departed the Chateau of Saint-Cloud and left France for exile in England.

===Deputy and minister (1830–1836)===

When the new government was formed, Thiers, with no government experience, was given a lesser position, that of undersecretary of state for Finance, under Laffitte, but was also awarded the Legion of Honor and the position of state counselor, which had a substantial salary. He ranked as one of the Radical supporters of the new dynasty, in opposition to the party of which his rival François Guizot was the chief literary man, and Guizot&#x27;s patron, the duc de Broglie, the main pillar. To have real influence and independence, Thiers knew that he needed a seat in the chamber of deputies, not just a government position. But to be eligible to run, he needed to own property important enough that he paid taxes of at least one thousand francs a year. His intimate friend, Madame Dosne, spoke to her husband, a wealthy businessman. Dosne arranged a loan of one hundred thousand francs to Thiers so that he could buy a lot and build a house in a new real estate development at Place Saint-George. In return, Dosne received the position of Receiver-General in Brest. A seat for Aix-en-Provence in the chamber of deputies was vacant. Now that he was eligible, Thiers ran and was elected on 21 October 1830. Ten years after his arrival in Paris, he began his political career.

He gave his first speech in the Chamber of Deputies, on the financial situation of the country, a month after his election. He had no experience as an orator; because of his small stature, his head barely appeared over the podium, and he spoke with a strong Provençal accent, which made the Parisians smile. The long, carefully prepared speech was greeted at the end with silence, though the content was approved. Thiers worked very hard to improve his speaking style, and eventually became a very effective orator.

The new government faced many difficulties. It gradually divided into two informal parties: the so-called Party of Movement, to which Thiers belonged, which wanted the maximum number of reforms as soon as possible; and the conservative Party of Order, who, once the new government was installed, wanted no further turbulence. Louis-Philippe made Jacques Laffitte, an advocate of rapid reform, his chief minister, in the anticipation that he would soon fail and would have to be replaced, which was exactly the result. After four and half months of turmoil, The King dismissed Laffitte and replaced him with a supporter of Order, Casimir Périer. Thiers was out of the government, and left only with his position as Deputy, which had no salary.

The funeral of an anti-government figure, General Lamarque, in June 1832, later immortalized by Victor Hugo in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, turned into the June Rebellion against the monarchy, with barricades raised in the Saint-Merri district. After it was suppressed, Thiers was brought back into the government as Minister of the Interior. He helped put down a Quixotic armed rebellion of the Legitimists under the Duchess de Berry who wanted to put the Bourbon dynasty back on the throne. She was hiding in a secret room behind a fireplace in Nantes, and was captured when the police looking for her, wishing to stay warm, started a fire, forcing her to surrender. In 1833 he declared he did not want to be the Joseph Fouché of the regime (the name of Napoleon&#x27;s chief of the secret police) and became Minister of Trade and Public Works. As a Deputy, he opposed the proposal for an income tax on the rich, arguing that it was a Jacobin idea of the French Revolution. This position won him the support of the growing French business class.

In 1833, he was nominated for an open seat in the Académie française, based on his ten-volume history of the French Revolution, and other books he had written on the law and public finance, and the 1830 monarchy, and the Congress of Verona. He was elected on the first ballot, with twenty-five votes; at age thirty-six, he was the second-youngest member elected in the 19th century. In July 1833, Thiers dedicated a new Paris landmark, the column in Place Vendôme. After 1833, his career was bolstered by his marriage to the daughter of his intimate friend, Madame Dosne, which allowed him to pay off his one hundred thousand franc loan from her father, finally giving him financial security. It also caused problems for him, because the aristocracy of Paris refused to receive her, since she was not one of them.

He returned to the Interior Ministry in 1834–36, and had to deal with discontent of the growing working class in France&#x27;s large cities. A workers&#x27; revolt in Lyon on 9 April 1834, caused by a reduction of salaries, led to riots and the death of 170 workers and 130 police and soldiers. Shortly afterwards, on 13 April, barricades went up in the Marais district in Paris. The army was summoned and launched forty thousand soldiers against the barricades. On rue Transnonain, a sergeant was wounded by a gunshot from a building. The soldiers attacked the building, killing the twelve inhabitants. Thiers was thereafter blamed by republicans and socialists for the &quot;Massacre of rue Transnonain.&quot;

Thiers also played an active role in the decoration of Paris; he cleared the space in front of the eastern colonnade of the Louvre, so visitors could have a clear view, and ordered the restoration of the Salon of Apollo, which became the setting for the famous Paris salon art exhibitions. He commissioned the bas-reliefs for the Arc-de-Triomphe, and selected Eugène Delacroix to paint murals for the library of the French Senate and frescoes on the walls of the church of Saint-Sulpice, despite the opposition of Louis-Philippe, who disliked Delacroix&#x27;s painting.

===Prime Minister (1836)===
In January 1836, the unpopular government of the Duke of Broglie lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, and the King needed a new Prime Minister. As he had done in 1830, he chose a man he was certain would soon fail; Adolphe Thiers. On the subject of Thiers, Louis-Philippe told Victor Hugo, &quot;He (Thiers) has spirit, but he is spoiled by the spirit of a &quot;parvenu&quot;; he has shown himself to be insatiable.&quot; Louis Philippe cited what he said was Talleyrand&#x27;s view of Thiers: &quot;You will never make anything of Thiers, but nonetheless he will be an excellent instrument. But he is one of those men whom you can make use of only if you give them satisfaction; but he is never satisfied. The misfortune, for you and for him, is that you cannot make him a cardinal.&quot;

Thiers accepted the position, and chose a government, keeping for himself the position of Foreign Minister. He told the Chamber of Deputies, &quot;Our country is in the middle of the greatest perils, and we must fight the disorder with all of our force. To save a revolution, we must preserve it from its own excesses. Whether these excesses are produced on the streets or in the abusive use of institutions, I will contribute, through force and by the laws, to put them down.&quot; He was given the support of the Deputies by a vote of 251 to 99. His new government proposed the construction of the first railroad in France, from Paris to Saint-Germain (though Thiers privately described it as &quot;A toy for the Parisians&quot;) and suppressed the national lottery on the grounds of morality.

Violent opposition to Louis-Philippe increased. A gunman named Alibaud attempted to shoot Louis-Philippe, who was saved by the armored walls of his carriage. The police linked Alibaud to a secret revolutionary group called &quot;Les Familles&quot;, by Armand Barbès and Louis Blanqui. Both were arrested and imprisoned, but later released, and went on to much more ambitious revolutionary projects. Because of the new threat of terrorist attacks, Louis-Philippe decided not to inaugurate the newly completed Arc de Triomphe, begun by Napoleon. Thiers dedicated the monument on 29 July 1836. The relationship between Thiers and Louis-Philippe became more and more strained. The King blocked many of Thiers&#x27; diplomatic initiatives, and conducted his own foreign policy. Thiers suggested to the King that France should follow the British model, and allow the Prime Minister to conduct all of the diplomatic and military affairs. Louis-Philippe refused, insisting that France was not England and he was the chief diplomat and head of the army. Thiers felt he had no alternative but to resign as prime minister, which he did on 29 August 1836. His place was taken by a conservative royalist, Louis-Mathieu Molé.

===Opposition and Prime Minister again (1837–1840)===

Out of office, he traveled in Italy. He went first to Rome, where his friend Ingres, the Director of the Villa Medici, gave him a tour of the monuments, then to Florence, where he had the idea of writing a history of that city. He rented a villa at Lake Como and began collecting documents for his research. He went to Italy two more times in 1837, renting the Villa di Castello and going through the archives. In the meanwhile, Louis-Philippe was increasingly unpopular. He survived three more assassination attempts, and new elections on 4 November showed gains for the center left, and losses for the center right. Thiers returned to the Deputies and in January 1839 delivered of series of speeches denouncing the government of the King, led by Molé. The government was assaulted from all sides, from the extreme right, extreme left, and center. Molé was forced to resign and call for new elections, which were held on 2 March 1839. The opposition won the elections, but because of their diverse views struggled to form a majority. For three months France was without a government. The most radical French revolutionaries, Barbés and Blanqui, saw this as the moment to launch a violent revolution. They had formed a secret organization, the &quot;Societé des Saisons&quot;, with about fifteen thousand members. On Sunday, 12 March 1839, when the center of Paris was deserted, they formed armed columns, and successfully seized the Palais de Justice and the Hôtel de Ville. From the balcony of the Hôtel de Ville, Barbés read a decree announcing the creation of a revolutionary government. But the army reacted immediately, and by the evening the revolution was reduced to a few barricades in the Faubourg Saint-Denis. Barbés and Blanqui were arrested and sentenced to confinement for life in the prison on Mont-Saint-Michel.

Thiers saw his moment and ran for President of the Chamber, but was narrowly defeated by a vote of 213–206. Louis-Philippe, who by this time detested Thiers, said with satisfaction that Thiers &quot;had the effect of a melon striking a stone&quot;. but Thiers still had a strong following in the chamber. In offering him the position of head of the government, Louis-Philippe told Thiers, &quot;Here I am obliged to submit to you, and accept my dishonor. You have been forced upon me. You will put my children out onto the streets. But finally I am a constitutional king, and I have no choice but to go through with it.&quot;

As President of the council or Prime Minister, Thiers kept for himself the title of Foreign Minister. His most notable accomplishment was to obtain from Britain the return of Napoleon&#x27;s ashes from Saint Helena. The idea was particularly pleasing to Thiers, because he had just begun writing a history of the Consulate and Empire, in twenty volumes. Rather than making the request public, he wrote to a personal English friend, Lord Clarendon, who was a member of the British government, saying: &quot;to keep a cadaver as a prisoner is not worthy of you, nor is it possible on the part of a government such as yours. The restitution of these remains is the final act of putting behind us the fifty years that have passed, and will be the seal placed on our reconciliation, and our close alliance.&quot; The British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, considered and accepted the request. The transfer was opposed by some in the French parliament, including Lamartine, who feared that it would stir republican sentiment in France, but it was welcomed by the population. A warship was dispatched to Saint Helena, and Thiers worked on the details of the design of the tomb and the plan of the parade that would carry it to the tomb, constructed within Les Invalides. The return of the ashes was a huge success, attracting enormous crowds in Paris. But by the time it took place Thiers was no longer in the government.

More unexpected news arrived on 5 August, while the remains of Napoleon were still en route from St. Helena to Paris. Louis-Napoleon, the nephew of the Emperor, had landed at Boulogne with a small force of soldiers, and had tried to spark an uprising by the army to overthrow Louis-Philippe. The soldiers in Boulogne refused to change sides; Louis-Napoleon was captured, taken to the Conciergerie in Paris, and put on trial. He was sentenced to life in prison, and sent to serve his sentence to the fortress of Ham.

The year 1840 also brought a political crisis between France, Russia and Britain because of France&#x27;s support for the ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, a long-time ally. (In 1829 he had donated the Luxor obelisk, now standing in the Place de la Concorde.) Lord Palmerston was convinced that the French would not fight, and sent a fleet to bombard Beirut and threaten Egypt. The French cabinet was divided, fearing that France was not ready for war; the French army was already engaged in the long, expensive military conquest of Algeria. The King made it clear to Thiers that he wanted peace. Thiers offered to resign, but the King refused his resignation, arguing that he wanted the British to believe that France would fight. When Thiers drafted a note to Britain warning that a British ultimatum to Egypt would upset the global balance of power, and he ordered construction of a new ring of fortresses around Paris. Palmerston did not attack Egypt, and crisis ended. The fortifications begun by Thiers during crisis were eventually finished, and became known as the Thiers wall, which later became (and remain today) the city limits of Paris.

After the end of the crisis, tensions remained between the King and Thiers, who drafted the King&#x27;s annual address to the Chamber of Deputies, adding the line, &quot;France is strongly attached to peace, but it will not purchase peace at a price unworthy of the nation and its King,&quot; and would not sacrifice the &quot;sacred independence and national honor which the French Revolution had put into his hands.&quot; Louis-Philippe removed this line from the speech, considering it too provocative to other European rulers. Thiers promptly offered his resignation, and this time it was accepted. A month later, he rose in Parliament to denounce the King&#x27;s foreign policy, declaring that France had lost its influence in the Middle East, and had a duty to defend Egypt against Britain, and Turkey against Russia.

===Opposition (1840–1848) ===

Once outside of the government, he devoted much of his time to writing &quot;Histoire du Consulat et de l&#x27;Empire&quot;, the first volume of which appeared in 1845. The book was a huge success, selling twenty thousand copies in a few weeks. The book was criticized by Chateaubriand, who called it &quot;an odious advertisement for Bonaparte, edited in the style of a newspaper&quot; It had the unplanned effect of raising even further the prestige of Napoleon&#x27;s nephew and Thiers&#x27; future enemy, Louis-Napoleon.

In December 1840, Thiers helped secure the election of Victor Hugo to the Académie Française, despite the opposition of the more conservative members. Hugo was accepted only on the fifth ballot, by a single vote. When elected, Hugo sent a copy of his new poem about Napoleon to Thiers, declaring to Thiers that Thiers was &quot;a man I honor and love; your spirit is one of those that seduces my own. One feels that before you entered the world of great affairs, you traversed that of great ideas. With my full sympathy, high estime and vivid admiration.&quot; From 1840 through 1844, Thiers traveled around Europe, crisscrossing Holland, Germany, Switzerland and Spain and visiting he battlefields where Napoleon fought and meeting people who had witnessed them. In the meanwhile, his chief political rival, Guizot, the leader of the right wing in the Deputies, headed the government. He called new elections in July 1846, which Guizot&#x27;s party narrowly won, with 266 seats of 449. However, in an ominous sign, ten of the twelve deputies from Paris opposed the government. As the King&#x27;s unpopularity grew, he suffered also a personal tragedy with great political implications; his son, the heir to the throne, was killed in an accident. His grandson, the new heir, was only a child.

Opposition to the King continued to grow; he was the target of two more assassination attempts in 1846. In the spring of 1846, Louis-Napoleon, disguised as a stonemason, escaped from the prison at Ham and fled to England, where he waited for an opportunity to make a grand return to France. Thiers, the leader of the center-left deputies, began to take a more active part in the Chamber of Deputies. He told a colleague, &quot;The King is easily frightened. He will only call on me when he is in danger. I will only take the ministry if I can be the master of it.&quot; A proposal to make a larger number of citizens eligible to vote was rejected by Guizot and his government: Guizot declared to the Chamber, &quot;the day will not come for universal suffrage.&quot;

===February Revolution (1848)===

The last parliamentary session of the constitutional monarchy began on 28 December 1847 with the announcement of a military success; the resistance to French rule in Algeria had been defeated. But immediately, opposition to the government grew. Since political meetings were forbidden, the left opposition began to organize banquets, large dinners in public places which were really opposition meetings. Thiers declared to the Chamber, &quot;Our country is marching with giant steps toward a catastrophe. There will be a civil war, a revision of the Charter, and perhaps a change of personnel at the highest level. If Napoleon II were alive, he would take the place of the present King.&quot;

The left opposition declared that they would hold an enormous banquet on the Place de la Madeleine on 22 February. Fearing trouble, Guizot declared the banquet illegal, and ammunition was given to the army garrison, and they prepared for trouble. Thiers, believing that the government was too strong to allow an uprising, advised caution and said he would not attend the banquet. The army commander, Marshal Bugeaud, put squadrons of dragoons on the streets. The day began peacefully, but by midday groups of demonstrators were raising barricades on the Champs-Élysées and hurling rocks at soldiers in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the corner of Boulevard des Capucines and rue Cambon. The volunteer members of the Garde Nationale were summoned to support the army, but few turned out. Thiers toured the streets on foot, and was recognized and cheered by many of the demonstrators. The demonstrations resumed on 23 February, under a freezing rain. The King remained calm, telling his sister, &quot;The Parisians never make a Revolution in the winter, and they won&#x27;t overthrow the Monarchy for a banquet.&quot; As the day advanced, the demonstrators raised more barricades and confronted the army. The leaders of many of the National Guard units informed the Prefect of police that they wanted reform and would not support the army against the population. A crowd of 600–800 National Guards threatened to storm the National Assembly building. Thiers addressed them, reminding them that the assembly was democratically elected. The guardsmen stopped their assault, and gave the parliament members a petition demanding reforms.

Within the Tuileries, the King was uncertain what to do. His prime minister, Guizot, advised him to form a new government under Molé, but Molé declined and suggested Thiers have the job. &quot;The house is burning,&quot; Molé told the King. &quot;You have to call on those who can put out the fire.&quot; The King reluctantly agreed, and sent for Thiers, but another event that evening changed the course of the Revolution; a unit of the army fired without orders on demonstrators outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Boulevard des Capucines, killing sixteen and wounding dozens.

Early in the morning of 24 February, Thiers arrived at the Tuileries and met with the King, who was in despair. He met also with Marshal Bugeaud, and learned that the army had only sixteen thousand men available; they were short of ammunition and exhausted. During the night, more barricades had appeared all over Paris. Thiers proposed withdrawing the army to Saint-Cloud, gathering his forces, and marching back into Paris with a full army (the strategy he followed in 1871 during the Paris Commune), but Marshal Bugeaud wanted to attack the barricades immediately; he told the King that it would cost twenty thousand lives; the King told Bugeaud that the price was too high, and called off the attack. The army columns began to disintegrate, as the soldiers joined the demonstrators. Thiers urged the King to flee to Saint-Cloud, but the King insisted on having his regular breakfast at 10:30 a.m., and then put on the uniform of a Lieutenant General to review the four thousand regular soldiers and two legions of National Guards gathered in the courtyard of the Tuileries. As he rode by, the regular soldiers cheered the King, but the National Guardsmen called out &quot;Down the Ministers! Down with the system!&quot; and shook their weapons at the King. The King abruptly turned around rode back to Palace, where he sat in an armchair, head in his hands. &quot;Everything is lost,&quot; he said to Thiers, &quot;I am overwhelmed.&quot; Thiers responded coldly, &quot;I&#x27;ve known that for a long time.&quot; His family urged him to remain and fight. The King turned to his marshals and generals and to Thiers and asked if there was any alternative, but they were silent. The King slowly wrote out and signed his act of abdication, changed from his uniform into civilian clothes, and left through the gardens of the Tuileries. A carriage took him out of Paris to Saint-Cloud, and soon afterwards he crossed the Channel to exile in England.

===Second Republic===

Once the King was gone, Thiers and the other Deputies moved quickly to the Chamber of Deputies to decide what to do next. They had not been there long before an immense crowd invaded the Chamber, shouting &quot;Long live the Republic!&quot; Thiers fled on foot, and made his way back to his house. A new government was quickly formed by the republicans Lamartine and Ledru-Rollin, but Thiers had no part in it. The new interim government quickly decreed the freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and called for new parliamentary elections, in which all men over the age of 21, who had been resident in their home for six months, could vote, raising the number of eligible voters from 200,000 to nine million. The Chamber was expanded to a National Assembly with nine hundred members. New elections were held; Thiers ran as a candidate in Marseille, and, for the first and only time in his career, was defeated. However, on 15 May, the more radical socialists staged effort to seize the government; they invaded the chamber and proclaimed a new government. This time, the Republican National Guard responded quickly to defend the government, recapturing the hall and the government. The socialist deputies who had taken part were expelled from the Assembly, leaving open seats. New elections for the open seats were held on 4 June, and Thiers was elected in four departments; Seine, Gironde, Orne, and Seine-Inferieure. He chose to be deputy for Seine-Inferieure.

At the same time, a familiar name reappeared in French politics; Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, resident in London, was elected to a seat in Paris by 80,000 votes, and also to seats in three other departments. The more radical republican deputies contested his election; Louis-Napoleon promptly withdrew his candidacy and remained in London, waiting for a more opportune moment. Thiers had been considered a leftist republican in the government of Louis-Philippe, but after the political earthquake of the 1848 revolution and the influx of new deputies, he appeared relatively conservative. While he was out of the Assembly, he published an essay in defense of capitalism and private property which won him the support of the French business community and middle class. Thiers took his seat as the head of the Finance Committee, and leader of the conservative republicans. In the tense and sometimes violent political climate, he took up the habit of always carrying a loaded pistol.

In September, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte returned to Paris and took part in the legislative elections. Though he stayed in London, was a Swiss citizen, and did not campaign, he was overwhelmingly elected in five departments. He took a residence on Place Vendôme. The first appearance of Louis-Napoleon at the Assembly, his Germanic accent and awkward speaking style, persuaded Thiers and other Deputies that he was &quot;minus habens&quot;; an imbecile. This was also the view of Ledru-Rollin and the socialist deputies. The new Assembly voted to hold elections for a new President of the Republic, the first in which all Frenchmen with residences could vote. Elections were set for 10 December 1848. Thiers considered running, but told Falloux, another Deputy: &quot;If I lost it would be a grave setback for the ideas of order; if I won, I would be obliged to embrace the ideas of the Republic, and, in truth, I am too honest a lad to marry such a bad woman.&quot; Instead, he made the major mistake of his political career; he decided to support Louis-Napoleon, certain that he could control him. He believed that Louis-Napoleon&#x27;s term would be a failure, which would open the way for Thiers to run in 1852. On the eve of the vote, Thiers hosted Louis-Napoleon at his home for dinner. In the December 1848 elections, the moderate republican Lamartine received just 18,000 votes; the socialist Ledru-Rollin received 371,000, and the conservative General Cavaignac received 1,448,000 votes. Louis-Napoleon received 5,345,000 votes, or three-quarters of the votes cast.

On 11 December, shortly after the elections, Louis-Napoleon invited Thiers to his home for dinner, and they discussed the future government. Louis-Napoleon offered the position of President of the Council of Ministers to Thiers, but Thiers refused. He wanted to retain his independence as a deputy. He and his wife dined frequently with Louis-Napoleon in the new presidential residence, the Élysée Palace. Under the new Constitution, new elections for the National Assembly were held on 13 May 1849. The new Assembly had 750 members, of whom 250 were republicans, including 180 radicals or socialists. There were 500 monarchists, divided about equally between Legitimists, who wanted a constitutional monarchy under a Bourbon king, and the Orleanists, who wanted a king from the family of Louis-Philippe. The socialists were impatient with the slow pace of change; led by Ledru-Rollin, they staged an uprising in Paris, which was quickly suppressed by the army. Ledru-Rollin fled to London. In 1849 a cholera epidemic struck Paris; among the victims was Thiers&#x27; father-in-law. Thiers and his wife inherited a substantial fortune.

In a speech in the Assembly in 1849 Thiers explained his political philosophy: &quot;Unlimited liberty leads to a barbaric society, where the strong oppress the others, and only the strongest have unlimited liberty... The liberty of one person stops at the liberty of other. Laws are born from this principle, and a civilized society. No one person has it in his power to instantly achieve the happiness of nations.&quot; On social issues he became more conservative; formerly a critic of the role of the church in education, he supported the Falloux Laws of 1850, which established a mixture of both Catholic and public schools, and for the first time required that each Commune of over five hundred persons have a school for girls.

The most conservative measure he proposed was a change in the electoral laws, which required that voters have lived in their residences for at least three years, and required a certain minimum income. He declared to the Assembly: &quot;Our goal is not to exclude the poor from voting, but to exclude the vile multitude, those who have handed over the liberty of so many republics to so many tyrants over the years.&quot; The law was approved, removing one-third of the voters in France from the voting lists. Thiers did not foresee that Louis-Napoleon, elected by universal suffrage, would later use this law as a weapon against the Assembly to reinforce his own rule. When a friend of Louis-Napoleon asked him if he wasn&#x27;t afraid of losing power without universal suffrage, he replied, &quot;Not at all. When the Assembly is hanging over the precipice, I will cut the cord.&quot;

As 1852 approached, Thiers looked forward to the end of the term of Louis-Napoleon; under the Constitution, he could not run again. Thiers began looking for other candidates to replace Louis-Napoleon, perhaps with the Duke of Joinville, from the Orleans family. Thiers and the other conservative leaders of the Assembly also rebelled against the high cost of Louis-Napoleon&#x27;s household; he requested 175 new staff for the Palace, and asked funding for an additional twenty grand dinners and twelve grand balls a year. Thiers and the Assembly rejected his request. Louis-Napoleon also sought an amendment to the Constitution to allow him to run for a second term; the vote was held on 21 July 1851. Louis-Napoleon&#x27;s proposal won a majority of the Assembly, but not the two-thirds required by the Constitution.

Blocked by the National Assembly, Louis-Napoleon decided to take a different route. In public he blamed Thiers and the Assembly for restricting the right to vote and for refusing to alter the Constitution for a second term, and secretly brought loyal army forces to Paris. Early in the morning of 2 December 1851, in what became known as the December 1851 coup d&#x27;état, the army took up positions in key positions in Paris, and at six a.m. the commissioner of police, Hubault, appeared at his residence at Place Saint-Georges and placed him under arrest. &quot;But don&#x27;t you know the law?&quot; Thiers protested. &quot;Do you know that you&#x27;re violating the Constitution?&quot; Hubault replied, &quot;I do not have the mission of discussing this with you, and moreover you have more knowledge than me.&quot; A carriage took Thiers to Mazas Prison. From his jail cell he could hear the sound of gunfire as the soldiers loyal to Louis-Napoleon secured the city. On 9 December, he was transported to the German border and sent into exile.

===Second Empire===

Thiers went to Brussels, where he learned that Louis-Napoleon had organized a national referendum on his rule; more than seven million voters approved the coup, while 646,000 disapproved it. Only in Paris was the coup unpopular; only 133,000 of 300,000 voters approved the coup. Special tribunals were set up to judge the republican opponents of the new regime; 5,000 were confined to house arrest, almost ten thousand were deported to prison camps in Algeria, and 240 were sent to camps in Guyana. 71 Republican deputies of the Assembly were, like Thiers, expelled from France. Thiers was bored in Brussels, so he moved to London, where his wife and mother-in-law joined him. He was received by the Duke of Wellington and Benjamin Disraeli, but as a native of Provence, he could not endure the British climate and soon departed for long travels in Germany and Italy. In the summer of 1852, Louis-Napoleon decided that he was no longer a threat, and on 20 August 1852 he was allowed to return to Paris. He stayed out of politics. He resumed his friendship with the painter Delacroix and with the sculptor François Rude, whom he had commissioned to make sculptural decoration for the Arc-de-Triomphe. For the next ten years, he devoted his attention to writing his history of the Consulate and Empire, publishing two volumes a year. The 19th and final 20th volume were published in 1862. The series was an immense public success; he sold fifty thousand subscriptions to the entire series, for a total of a million volumes. In addition to the advance of 500,000 francs he received for writing the work, he received author&#x27;s royalties, which added to his already substantial fortune from mining stock and the inheritance from his father-in-law.

In 1863, the now Emperor Napoleon III began to loosen some of the restrictions on political opposition. Thiers was encouraged to re-enter political life by his friends, and by a new acquaintance, the Prussian ambassador to Paris, Otto von Bismarck. Thiers decided to run for election to the Assembly. On 31 May 1863, at the age of sixty-six, he was elected as a deputy for Paris. He returned to the Assembly on 6 November 1863 and took his seat, but found that under Napoleon III the protocol had changed. Instead of speaking from the tribune, members were only allowed to speak from their seats. Thiers was uncomfortable with this way of speaking, and his first few speeches were failures, but he soon mastered the form. On 11 January 1864 he delivered a blistering attack on Napoleon&#x27;s government, and listed the &quot;necessary liberties&quot; he said were lacking in France: &quot;Security of the citizen against violence from individuals or from the arbitrary use of power; liberty, but not impunity, for the press; free elections; freedom of the people&#x27;s representatives; and public opinion expressed by the majority guiding the steps of the government. These are the liberties that the people are asking for today; tomorrow, in a tone very different, they may be demanding them.&quot; The speech made him again a leading figure of the opposition; he was cheered by a crowd outside his house when he returned home.

In the months that followed, Thiers criticized the Emperor&#x27;s costly and doomed expedition to conquer Mexico. He also condemned the Emperor&#x27;s principle of nationalities, as applied in Italy, of supporting the unification into one country of small states whose populations spoke a common language. &quot;This principle will lead,&quot; Thiers said, &quot;one day or the other, to a policy of race which will generate future wars&quot;.&quot; On 3 May 1866, when war seemed likely between Prussia and Austria over the Prussian annexation of Holstein, Thiers told the assembly: &quot;If Prussia is successful, we will see the creation of a new German Empire; the Empire of Charles V which once resided in Vienna, will now reside in Berlin; an Empire which will press against our borders...&quot; After the crushing defeat of Austria by Prussia at the Battle of Sadowa, Thiers declared, &quot;It was France which was defeated at Sadowa.&quot; On 14 March 1867, he told the Assembly: &quot;France has no more allies in Europe. Austria is defeated, Italy is looking for adventure, England wants to avoid the Continent, Russia is occupied with its own interests, and as far as Spain is concerned, never have the Pyrenees been so high. We have to secure an alliance with England, and rally the small states. This is a modest policy but confirms with good sense. We cannot afford to commit another error.&quot;

On economic policy, he was relentlessly conservative; he called for protectionism to defend French industry, and condemned the high cost of Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann&#x27;s rebuilding of Paris, which had reached 461 million francs. Under pressure from the Assembly, Napoleon III was forced to dismiss Haussmann. Thiers faced opposition from both the left and right. In the elections of 1869, he was defeated in the election for his seat in Marseille by the republican Gambetta, but, against a candidate backed by Napoleon III, he retained his seat in Paris. A national referendum on Napoleon&#x27;s policies on 8 May 1870, confirmed the Emperor&#x27;s popularity in the provinces of France by a vote of 7,386,000 yes, 1,560,000 no, and 1,894,000 abstentions. It also confirmed his unpopularity in Paris, which voted 184,000 no and 138,000 yes.

=== War and fall of the Empire ===
The new Chancellor of Prussia, Otto von Bismarck, saw France as the main obstacle to German unification under Prussia. He adroitly managed a diplomatic crisis over the Spanish throne to bring about a war with France, which he was confident Prussia would win. The press in Paris began clamoring for war, and Napoleon&#x27;s marshals assured him that France would win. Bismarck privately told his friends that his declaration to the French on the crisis &quot;had the effect of a red flag on a bull.&quot; Thiers knew Bismarck well and saw clearly what he was doing. The prime minister, Émile Ollivier, spoke to the Assembly on 15 July, saying that France had done all it could to avoid war, but now it was inevitable, and France was well prepared and would win.

Thiers rose to speak and declared: &quot;Do you really mean to say that, for a question of form, you have decided to release torrents of blood?&quot; He demanded proof that Prussia had really insulted France. The members of the right wing parties jeered and hooted Thiers, and one Deputy called out, &quot;you are the anti-patriotic trumpet of disaster!&quot; Thiers responded, &quot;I find this war extremely imprudent. More than anyone else I want to repair the results of Sadowa, but I find the occasion extremely badly chosen.&quot; The right wing of the Assembly erupted with insults, calling him a traitor, a fool and worthless old man. After the session, he was insulted in the streets and a crowd gathered to throw stones at his house. The Assembly, confident of success, ignored Thiers and voted on 19 July to declare war. That evening Thiers told a friend, the Deputy Buffet, &quot;I know the state of the military in France and that in Germany. We&#x27;re lost.&quot;

As the Franco-Prussian War progressed, Thiers&#x27; warnings proved correct. Due largely to the country&#x27;s inefficient railroads and a defective plan, the French Army was only able to mobilize 264,000 men in the first weeks of the war, as opposed to 450,000 Germans. The French army, led by Napoleon III in person, had a superb cavalry, but the Germans had superior artillery and leadership. On 1 September the French army was trapped and surrounded at Sedan. To avoid a slaughter, the Emperor surrendered the army on 2 September, and was taken prisoner with his army.

===Government of National Defence (1870–1871)===

The news of the disaster reached Paris on 2 September, and was confirmed the next day. Two hundred twenty Deputies of the Assembly gathered on the 4th and, following Thiers&#x27; formula, declared that, &quot;due to circumstances&quot;, there was a vacancy of power. At the same time, a group of republican deputies, including Léon Gambetta and headed by General Trochu, met at the Hôtel de Ville and formed a provisional government, called the Government of National Defense, which was determined to continue the war. Thiers told the monarchist deputies, &quot;In the presence of the enemy, who will soon be outside Paris, we have just one thing to do; to retire from here with dignity.&quot; He closed the session of the Assembly and offered his services to the new republican government.

On 9 September, Jules Favre the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the new government, asked Thiers to go to London to persuade the British to join an alliance with France against Prussia. Thiers, though he was seventy-four years old, agreed to accept the mission, and offered to visit other capitals as well. He traveled by train and boat to Calais and London, where he met with Lord Granville, the British Foreign Minister, and William Gladstone, the Prime Minister. Thiers was so exhausted by the voyage that he fell asleep when Gladstone was speaking. Gladstone was sympathetic, but explained that Britain would remain neutral. He did offer to arrange a meeting between Favre and the Germans to learn what the terms would be for ending the war. The meeting between Bismarck and Favre took place 18–20 September at the Rothschild estate at Ferrières, near Paris. Bismarck explained to Favre that, to end the war, France would need to surrender Alsace, part of Lorraine, several border fortresses, and a large sum of money. Favre rejected the proposal, declaring, &quot;not an inch of our territory, not a stone of our fortresses.&quot; With the negotiations at an end, the German army moved swiftly to surround Paris.

Thiers continued his long voyage in search of allies. He travelled to Vienna and met with the Chancellor of Austria, then to Saint Petersburg, where he met with the Czar and the Russian prime minister, but he received no support. He returned to Vienna to meet Emperor Franz Joseph, and went to Florence to meet King Victor Emmanuel II, and was kindly received, but received no offers of military support. Thiers returned to France, convinced that government would have to negotiate an end to the war. On his return to France, he headed to Paris. Chancellor Bismarck arranged for Thiers to pass through the German lines to meet with the French government within the city, which by this time was completely surrounded by German troops. When Thiers arrived in Paris on 31 October 1870, the situation was extremely tense. Félix Pyat, a radical socialist and a future leader of the Paris Commune, organized demonstrations against Thiers, whom he accused of threatening to sell France to the Germans, and threatened to have him hung. Favre urged Thiers to go to Versailles and negotiate with Bismarck. Thiers crossed the lines again and met Bismarck. The negotiations continued for four days; Bismarck demanded only Alsace and a large payment. Thiers returned to Paris and urged Favre and the Government to accept the offer and end the war, but General Trochu and Favre were adamant that Paris could hold out and that France was still strong enough to win the war.

The French forces inside Paris made unsuccessful efforts to break the German siege, while the German army advanced through the Loire Valley, and the Government of National Defense, along with Thiers, was forced to move to Bordeaux. On 6 February 1871, Gambetta resigned from the government. and new elections were called for 8 February. The government accepted a temporary armistice beginning on 17 February. On the same day, in a grand ceremony in the Palace of Versailles, the Germans proclaimed William I the first Emperor of the new German Empire. While Paris still wanted to resist, most of France wanted an end to the war as soon as possible. Thiers was a candidate in the elections, and won in twenty-six different departments, with a total of two million votes. He chose to represent a seat in Paris. The majority of the two hundred newly elected deputies favored a constitutional monarchy, though it is also included a substantial group of republicans, including Victor Hugo. At the first session, Jules Grévy, a republican sympathetic to Thiers, was elected president of the assembly, with 519 votes of the 536 voting. On 14 February, the Assembly voted to pass the powers of the Government of National Defense to the new Assembly. On 17 February, on a proposition by Grévy, Thiers was elected the &quot;Chef du pouvoir executif&quot;, or Chief Executive of the government. He asked the Assembly that the words &quot;Of the French Republic&quot; be added to his title. He told the Assembly: &quot;I have great admiration for cooks. They call them Chefs. You have named me the &quot;Chef&quot; of the Executive Power. Do you take me for a cook? Do you take France for a kitchen?&quot; The deputies laughed and agreed to the addition. The new government was promptly recognized by Britain, Italy, Austria, and Russia. For the first time since 1852, France was once again officially a republic.

===Chief Executive and end of the fighting===
On 19 February, Thiers announced the formation of a new government with nine ministers, a majority of republicans, including Jules Favre and Jules Simon. The first task assigned by the Assembly was to negotiate an end to the War. Thiers traveled with a delegation of five members of the Assembly to Versailles, where Bismarck was waiting. When he arrived at the hotel, he met the Prussian Field Marshal Moltke, who told him, &quot;You are lucky to be negotiating with Bismarck. If it were me, I would occupy your country for thirty years and in that time there would be no more France.&quot; At the first meeting, Bismarck demanded the province of Alsace and eight billion francs. Thiers insisted that France could pay no more than five billion francs, and Bismarck reduced the payment, but insisted that Germany must have part of Lorraine and Metz as well. The talks were long and stressful; at one point Thiers, exhausted, broke down and wept. Bismarck helped him to a sofa, covered him with his overcoat, and told him, &quot;Ah, my poor Monsieur Thiers, there is no one but you and I who really love France.&quot; The negotiations resumed, and Thiers conceded Alsace and part of Lorraine, in exchange for a reduction in the payment. He told the other French delegates, &quot;If we lose one or two provinces it is not of great importance. There will be another war when France will be victorious, and we will get them back. But the billions we give to Germany now we will never recover.&quot; Thiers insisted, however, that France keep the fortress town of Belfort. Bismarck conceded the town, on the condition that, when the armistice was signed, the Prussian army could hold a brief victory parade on the Champs-Élysées, and could remain until the treaty was ratified. Thiers felt he had little choice but to accept.

Thiers and his delegation returned to Bordeaux, and on 28 February, Thiers, sometimes breaking down in tears, read the terms to the Assembly. In the debate that followed, fifty members spoke for and against the peace. The members from Alsace and Lorraine strongly objected, and member Victor Hugo demanded, in the interest of history and posterity, to continue the war. The Deputy Louis Blanc declared that ten million Frenchmen wanted to keep fighting. &quot;But where are they?&quot; Thiers asked. &quot;In this Assembly, elected by universal suffrage, three-quarters of the members want peace.&quot; As Thiers predicted, the Assembly voted on 1 March by 546 votes to 107 to accept Bismarck&#x27;s terms. On 2 March the Germans held their parade on the Champs-Élysées. All the shops were closed and there were no Parisians on the street.

===Paris Commune===

Once the armistice was finished, the National Assembly held its first session in Versailles, and Thiers traveled to Paris on 15 March with the intention of reopening the government ministries there. He found the city in a state of revolutionary fever. At the time of the armistice, the National Guard in Paris had grown to 380,000. Predominantly working class, most members depended on the 1.5 francs a day they were paid. The Guard had become deeply radicalized by several revolutionary and socialist movements. With the war over, the National Assembly proposed ending their salary. The Guard had also been outraged by the Prussian victory march on the Champs Élysées; they demanded that the war continue. One attempt to overthrow the city government had already taken place, and had been put down with great difficulty. There were just thirty thousand regular army soldiers in the Paris garrison; a large part of the French regular army was still held in German prison camps.

Army depots in the city held 450,000 rifles and two thousand cannons. On 18 March, Thiers sent army units to move the cannons out of Paris. Many cannons were removed without difficulty, but on Montmartre, where the largest park of cannons was located, the army encountered crowds of armed and hostile guardsmen. Fighting broke out, and two army generals were seized and killed by the Guardsman. A general uprising began, and the revolutionaries seized the major government buildings. The guardsmen did not know that Thiers was still in Paris, at the new foreign ministry on the Quai d&#x27;Orsay; if they had known he certainly would have been captured and probably killed. Instead, he escaped the city via the Bois de Boulogne and made his way to Versailles. Thiers then followed the same plan that he had proposed to Louis-Philippe during the 1848 Revolution, but which the King had rejected; instead of fighting the insurrection immediately in Paris with the troops he had, he ordered regular army to withdraw to Versailles, to gather its forces, and then, when it was ready, to recapture the city.

While Thiers assembled his forces, including French soldiers just released from the German prison camps, Parisians elected a radical republican and socialist city government on 26 March: the Paris Commune. 224,000 Parisians voted, while 257,000 abstained. The more moderate members elected, including Georges Clemenceau, departed, leaving the Commune under the control of the most militant revolutionary movements. Similar Communes were quickly declared in Lyon, Marseille, and other cities, but were rapidly suppressed by the army. The Central Committee of the Commune declared that, if the French government no longer recognized Paris as the capital of France, Paris and the surrounding Department of the Seine would become an independent republic. Thiers summoned the Assembly in Versailles on 27 March and declared, &quot;There are some enemies of order who claim that we are trying to overthrow the Republic. I give them a formal denial; they are lying to France ... We have accepted this mission, to defend order and to re-organize the country. When order has been re-established, the country will have the liberty to choose as it wishes whatever will be its future destiny.&quot; Thiers declared that the country needed to unite behind the Republic; he stated his famous formula, &quot;The Republic is the form of government that divides us the least.&quot;
Thiers named Marshal Patrice MacMahon, who had led the French Army during the victorious war to liberate parts of Italy from the Austrians, to command the new Army of Versailles.
In early April, the first skirmishes between the army and Commune soldiers took place in the vicinity of Paris. Within Paris, the Commune began to take hostages, including Georges Darboy, the Archbishop of Paris, the curate of the Madeleine and about two hundred priests. They proposed to exchange them for Louis Blanqui, the revolutionary leader imprisoned at Mont-Saint-Michel. Thiers, with the support of the National Assembly, refused, saying he &quot;would not negotiate with murderers&quot;, and he feared that the exchange would simply lead to more hostage taking. In response, a mob attacked Thiers&#x27; empty house, taking all his personal belongings and later setting fire to the house.

On 21 May, the French army, with 120,000 soldiers, entered the city through an undefended gate. By the end of the 22nd the Army had captured the west of the city and Montmartre, and on the 23rd, they captured most of the center. The Commune soldiers were outnumbered four or five to one, had no single military leader, no plan of defense, and no possibility of aid from the outside. As they retreated, they set fire to the government buildings, including the Tuileries Palace, the State Council at the Palais Royal, the Ministry of Finance, the Prefecture of Police, the Palace of Justice, and the Hôtel de Ville, destroying the city archives. On 24 May the Archbishop of Paris and many of the hostage priests were taken out and shot. The Commune soldiers set up a new defensive line on 25 May and the fighting intensified. Thiers and MacMahon set up their headquarters at the Quai d&#x27;Orsay. Despite orders from Thiers and MacMahon, many army units systematically shot the Communard prisoners they had captured. On 26 May, the fighting was centered in Belleville and around the Place du Trône (now Place de la Nation). That day the Commune ordered the execution of thirty-six policemen and ten priests on Rue Haxo. The fighting continued through 28 May, until the capture of Père Lachaise cemetery and the city hall of the 11th arrondissement. On the 29th, the last bastion of the Commune, the fort of Vincennes, surrendered.

The army casualties numbered 873 dead and 6,424 wounded. 6,562 Commune fighters were buried in common graves, and later transferred to city cemeteries. 43,522 alleged Communards and Commune supporters, including 819 women, were captured and taken to Versailles for trial by military courts. Most were released immediately, but after trials by military tribunals, ninety-three were sentenced to death (of whom 23 were executed; the others were sent outside of France), and about ten thousand more sentenced to deportation or prison. Thousands more Commune participants, including a majority of the members of the Commune council, escaped to exile. All were given amnesty in 1879 and 1880, and allowed to return home. Some, including the famous anarchist Louise Michel, quickly returned to political agitation.

===Making peace===
During the dramatic events of the Commune, France was still officially at war with Prussia and then with the new German Empire. The fighting had stopped, but German soldiers occupied about half the territory of France. Bismarck and the German government were concerned by the Paris uprising, and feared that France would resume fighting the war. Bismarck declared that Germany would not remove its soldiers from France until the French government was solidly established, and twice offered Thiers German soldiers to help suppress it, but Thiers refused.

Once the Commune had fallen to the French Army, Thiers turned his attention to liberating French soil from German occupation. He had lost Alsace and part of Lorraine, with a total population of 1.6 million of the 36.1 million inhabitants of France; the government had a deficit of nearly three billion francs, France owed Germany five billion francs under the terms of peace, which had to be paid largely in gold; and the destruction during the Paris Commune required 232 million francs to repair. Thiers used his considerable financial skills to find the money. He borrowed money from the Bank of France and the Morgan bank in London, and in June 1871 he issued bonds, which brought in over 4 billion francs. In July 1871, Thiers was able to pay the first five hundred million francs of the payment to Germany. In exchange, as they had promised, the Germans withdrew their troops from three departments; the Eure, the Somme, and the lower Seine.

===President of the Republic (1871–1873)===

Despite his success with the national finances, Thiers was in a precarious political position. France was predominantly rural, religious and conservative, and the National Assembly reflected this. A majority of the Assembly members supported some form of constitutional monarchy, though they were about equally divided between those who wanted a king from the former Bourbon monarchy, and the Orleanists, who wanted a descendant of Louis-Philippe. There were even a few deputies who wanted a descendant of Napoleon III on the throne.

In June 1871, against the wishes of Thiers, the Assembly voted by 472 to 97 to allow exiled members of the Bourbons and Orleans families to return to France. They were led by Henri, Count of Chambord, the heir to the Bourbon throne, who declared his willingness to rule France as Henry V. He received considerable support in the beginning, but lost much of it when he declared that he would replace the French tricolor with the white flag of the Bourbons. Thiers protested that it was not possible to have constitutional monarchy with three different royal dynasties, the Bourbons, the Orleans, and the Bonapartes, all claiming the throne. The republicans in the Assembly, including Léon Gambetta, rallied around Thiers as a defender of the republic.

The appearance of the Count of Chambord provoked a political crisis, which worked to the advantage of Thiers. He persuaded the republicans that he was the least monarchist of the monarchists, and persuaded the monarchists that he was the least republican of the republicans. On 30 August 1871, the Assembly voted 494 to 94 to change the title of Thiers from Chief of the Executive Power to President of the Republic, under the authority of the National Assembly. It was a remarkable political achievement; the Third Republic had been created with the votes of the anti-republican monarchists. In private, he was not very kind to the assembly; he told a friend that &quot;I have an Assembly of 150 insurgents [the republicans] and four hundred &quot;poltrons&quot; (chicken-hearts). One could say that the real founder of the Republic is the Count of Chambord.&quot;

Thiers moved quickly to set up a strong and conservative republic. The Assembly and government remained in Versailles, until the government buildings in Paris could be repaired. Thiers lived in the Prefecture building of Versailles. He considered moving into the official presidential residence in Paris, the Élysée Palace, but his wife rejected the idea, declaring that &quot;we would be in Paris fifteen days before Monsieur Thiers would be assassinated.&quot; He did hold receptions and events in the Élysee, travelling back and forth to Paris with a large escort of police. The Assembly voted funds to rebuild his house on Place Saint-Georges in Paris, which had been burned by the Communards, and gave him money to replace his belongings, art collection, and library, which had been looted.

His first priority was to rid the country entirely of the German occupation of the east and north of France. By the end of September 1871, after the payment of 1.5 billion francs, six more departments were liberated, but twelve were still occupied, until the debt could entirely be paid off. The sum amounted to one sixth of the entire budget of the Republic. Within the Assembly, the republicans were gaining at the expense of the constitutional monarchists, but they were also divided into several factions, with Thiers usually among the moderate republicans while Léon Gambetta led the far left. The right was also divided into factions, some wishing a constitutional monarchy under the Orleanist Count of Paris, others under the Bourbon Count of Chambord. It was a very unstable mixture. Early in his presidency, Thiers declared, &quot;In general, the country is wise, but the political parties are not. It is these, and only these, that we have to fear. It is only these which we have to guard against.&quot; Thiers wrote late in his memoirs that he would have preferred a constitutional monarchy, but he knew it was impossible at that moment, given the strong majority of republicans, and supporting a monarchy would have been &quot;a violation of my duties toward France; I had as my mission to pacify and to prevent the conflicts of parties.&quot;
In January 1872, in partial elections for the National Assembly, Victor Hugo ran for a seat in the National Assembly for Paris as a radical republican against a moderate republican backed by Thiers. Hugo was defeated by 121,000 to 93,000 votes. Of sixteen seats up for election, republicans won eleven and only four were won by monarchists. Thiers wrote, &quot;The great majority of the middle class, businessmen, and country people, without saying expressly that they were for the republic, said &quot;we are for the government of Thiers&quot;. Thiers further won the support of the middle class and businessmen by opposing a proposed income tax, which he declared was entirely arbitrary, &quot;inspired by political hatreds and passions.&quot; The tax was rejected.

He was a convinced protectionist, wishing to shelter French industry against free trade and foreign competition. On this issue he was in a minority; the Assembly voted 367 to 297 to reduce tariffs on imported goods. Thiers offered his resignation, which was rejected by the Assembly; with only eight dissenting voices, they insisted that he remain as president. Thiers was an advocate of obligatory long military service; he pushed through a law requiring obligatory service of five years for French men. To the monarchists, he seemed more and more like a republican. He told them, &quot;I found the Republic already made. A monarchy is impossible because there are three dynasties for a single throne.&quot; In 1873, the monarchists of the Assembly, led by the Duke de Broglie, began looking for a way to bring about his downfall.

The primary goal of Thiers in 1873 was to pay off the debt to Germany, to liberate the last French territory occupied by the Germans. France still owed three billion francs, more than the national budget, with final payment due in August 1875. He made agreements with the major fifty-five banks of Europe, and issued bonds which, based on the good credit of France, brought in more than the amount required. Thiers signed a new convention with Germany on 15 March 1873, calling for the Germans to leave the last four French departments they held, Ardennes, Vosges, Meurthe-et-Moselle and Meuse by July 1873, two years ahead of schedule. Germany retained only the fortress of Verdun, and the territory of a radius of three kilometers around it. The National Assembly voted a special resolution to thank Thiers for liberating French territory ahead of schedule. The right wing deputies abstained, but it passed with the full support of the republicans. After the resolution passed, Thiers was congratulated by his longtime friend and ally, Jules Simon: &quot;Now you just have to name a successor.&quot; Thiers responded, &quot;but there&#x27;s no one!&quot; Simon replied, &quot;They have Marshal MacMahon.&quot; &quot;Oh, about that,&quot; Thiers responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, he would never accept.&quot;

===Downfall (1873)===
The Duke de Broglie was carefully preparing a way to bring down Thiers. He modified the rules of the Assembly so that the President had the power to veto laws passed by the Assembly, but also requiring that the President ask permission from the head of the Assembly before he spoke to the body. On 2 April, the moderate republican president of the Assembly, Jules Grévy, was forced to resign by a personal scandal and was replaced by a deputy of the center-right, Buffet, who supported a constitutional monarchy. Soon afterwards, on 27 April, an election was held in Paris to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. Both the candidate of the monarchists and the moderate republican candidate supported by Thiers was defeated by a more radical republican named Barodet, who was supported by Léon Gambetta and the left wing of the republicans. Further elections were held on 11 May: five of the six open seats were won by republicans. The right wing of the Assembly became alarmed that the country was moving too far to the left and decided it was time to get rid of Thiers.

The Duke de Broglie turned to Marshal MacMahon, a veteran soldier who had defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Magenta, had been wounded fighting the Germans and had defeated the Commune. MacMahon declined at first, but as Broglie persisted, he said that he had no political ambitions, but that if Thiers retired, he did not want to leave France without a government. In the parliamentary debate that soon followed, Thiers declared: &quot;Of course I am for a republic...outside of a republic, there is nothing but chaos.&quot; Thiers was immediately supported by Gambetta, leader of the left republicans, who said, &quot;Thiers is the best shield against the monarchists in the Assembly.&quot; His ally Jules Simon warned him: &quot;You irritate the left but you don&#x27;t appease the right&quot;, but Thiers was confident of victory; he told Simon, &quot;I have the popularity; the country is with me.&quot;

Thiers proposed a new cabinet, but de Broglie and the right wing objected that the new government was not conservative enough. A debate and vote of confidence in his government was scheduled for 23 May. The diplomatic corps was in the audience, along with the Thiers family, and Marshal MacMahon, in civilian clothes. De Broglie began the debate, warning that the country needed a firm government of the right because without it the radical party, which had never repudiated the Commune, would win. He said: &quot;Posterity is merciless to governments and ministers who by weakness surrender to the enemy the laws and societies they are charged to defend.&quot; Under the new rules of the Assembly, Thiers, as president, was not allowed to respond directly on the floor of the Assembly. However, he demanded and received the right to reply. He spoke emotionally at length, explaining that he, a longtime supporter of the monarchy, had decided that, &quot;considering the way of things today in the civilized world, for you and me, in practice a monarchy is absolutely impossible.&quot; He described accomplishments and policies, and concluded, &quot;What I am describing is a policy of conservatism; the path of our policy is the policy between two extremes.&quot; The Assembly then voted, resulting in a declaration of no confidence in the Thiers government by a vote of 362 to 348. The next day, on 24 May, Thiers submitted his resignation as president. The same day, the Assembly voted to replace Thiers with Marshal MacMahon. De Broglie became the head of the new President&#x27;s council of ministers. De Broglie proclaimed that the new government&#x27;s priorities would be &quot;to prevent the invasion of the radical element&quot;, and &quot;to strengthen the base of the social order.&quot;

===Last years===

Thiers continued to sit in the Assembly as a deputy from Paris after his fall, though he spoke only once, on 27 March 1874, against a proposal to build more forts around Paris. Rather than making Paris a battlefield again, Thiers preferred using the money to add more soldiers to the army. Despite his opposition, the measure was passed by the conservative government.

Thiers did have the satisfaction of seeing de Broglie fail in his effort to make France a constitutional monarchy; the monarch proposed by de Broglie, the Count of Chambord, once again refused to accept the tricolor flag and certain limits on his reign. The restoration plan was defeated in the Assembly, and de Broglie resigned on 16 May 1874. Count Chambord went back into exile and never returned to France. New elections were held on 20 February 1876. Thiers was re-elected to his seat in Paris, and the republicans triumphed. The new Assembly had 360 republicans, 120 royalists, and 80 supporters of a new Bonaparte regime.

Thiers, seventy-six years old at the time of leaving the government, was in declining health. He came less frequently to the Assembly, and spent his time supervising the reconstruction of his house, and traveling in Switzerland and Italy. He was elected to the new French Senate as the representative of the city of Belfort, which he had refused to cede to Germany, but he preferred to sit in the Assembly, and, after the dissolution of the old Assembly in 1876, in the new Chamber of Deputies,

In his last parliament session, he found himself on the side of the republicans against the monarchist government. A right-wing journal referred to Thiers as a &quot;sinister old man&quot;. During one debate a member of the government claimed that the Assembly, not Thiers, was responsible for liberating French territory from the Germans. Thiers was present when the republican leader, Léon Gambetta, rose to speak. He pointed out to Thiers and said: &quot;I will not take away from the illustrious man of state who is before me, whom no one honors more than me, the honor and glory which belongs to him, but which he does not want to claim for himself alone. That which he cannot do, history will do.&quot; The Chamber gave a long ovation to Thiers, and the old man wept with emotion.

On 15 April 1877, Thiers celebrated his 80th birthday; he received telegrams of congratulations from all over Europe, including a friendly message from Bismarck. President MacMahon, a political novice, was having difficulties forming a government. He recalled de Broglie to be his prime minister. On 16 May 1877, Thiers was one of 363 deputies voted no confidence in de Broglie. The government fell and new elections were scheduled, but Thiers did not live to see them. He succumbed to a fatal stroke on 3 September at St. Germain-en-Laye while writing an election manifesto for the republicans.

The funeral of Thiers on 8 September was both a state and a political event. President MacMahon wanted to organize a state funeral, and to personally follow the casket, but Madame Thiers refused; she wanted no monarchists to take part in the ceremony. Instead, Thiers was buried with full military honors; the cortège was accompanied by three battalions of infantry, a squadron of cavalry and a battery of artillery. Shops in Paris were closed, buildings were covered with black crepe. The cortege to Père Lachaise, was led by the group of 363 republican deputies who had voted with Thiers against the government. It was headed by Léon Gambetta and Victor Hugo.

The historian Jules Ferry described the funeral procession: &quot;From rue Le Pelletier to Père Lachaise, a million people were packed in masses along the route of the cortege, standing up, hats off, saluting the casket, which was covered with mountains of flowers carried from all of France. The crowd gave one single rolling cry, grave, resolute, formidable, from both sides of the boulevards: Vive la Republique!&quot;

==Family and personal life==
The father of Adolphe, Louis Thiers, had an extremely turbulent career; he was confined to a monastery by his father for a year after running up unpaid debts; he was arrested and imprisoned several times, but protected by a connection with Lucien Bonaparte, the younger brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, whom he saved from imprisonment.

Louis Thiers was married to Marie-Claire Fougasse in 1785, and had a son, but spent most of his time with his mistresses. Marie-Claire Fougasse died on 3 March 1797. Six weeks later, on 15 April 1797, Marie-Joseph-Louis-Adolphe Thiers was born to Marie-Madeleine Amic, one of his father&#x27;s mistresses. Four weeks later, on 13 May 1797, Pierre-Louis married Marie-Madeleine Amic, making Adolphe legitimate. A few days later, Pierre-Louis disappeared, without leaving an address. After leaving his wife and child, Louis Thiers continued to have a career of ups and downs. He was appointed by Lucien Napoleon as a providers of rations for Napoleon&#x27;s Army of Italy, which brought him a large fortune. He brought back two mistresses from Italy, obtained another lucrative government post, from which he seems to have embezzled a large sum; he was chased down, arrested, but again released through the influence of Lucien Bonaparte. He had several children from his mistresses, but had no contact with Adolphe, who was raised entirely by his mother. In 1825, when Adolphe was becoming famous, his father wrote to him, asking for money. Thiers responded coldly that Pierre-Louis had never been a father to him, and that his only loyalty was to his mother, who had raised him. Nonetheless, he later provided financial support to both his father and to his half-brothers.
Adolphe&#x27;s mother belonged to the family of the poet André Chénier. Adolphe&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a merchant from Marseille and his maternal grandmother was from Greece. While he was a student in Aix-en-Provence, Thiers probably became engaged to a young woman, Emilie Bonnefaux, from a prosperous Aix family. He left her behind when he moved to Paris, but her brother pursued Thiers to Paris, and fought a duel with him. Thiers was not hit and refused to fire on his opponent, and the matter was considered settled. Emilie married another man two years later.

Not long after he arrived in Paris, Thiers met Eurydice Dosne, the wife of a wealthy businessman and real estate speculator. When she met Thiers, she had been married fifteen years and had two children. She was just three years older than Thiers. They became very close and it is very probable that she became his mistress. Her husband provided important financial support to Thiers throughout his political career. On 7 November 1833, Thiers married her daughter, Elise Dosne, who was sixteen years old, twenty years younger than Thiers. The wedding allowed Thiers to pay off his debts, and to buy the house on Place Saint-Georges. His enemies claimed that his new wife was his own daughter, but Elise was born while Thiers was still a law student in Aix-en-Provence. Thiers attended all official events accompanied by both his wife and his mother-in-law, whom he called &quot;My ladies&quot; (&quot;Mes Dames&quot;). This offended the aristocratic society of Paris, who considered Thiers, even as a government minister, a social-climber and &quot;parvenu&quot;.

In the earlier part of his life in Paris, Thiers, like other political and literary figures of the time, had several mistresses. He was involved in one minor scandal in the summer of 1835, when he was married, Minister of the Interior and member of the Academie Française. He and several ministers of government officials had a very rowdy party at the Chateau of Grandvaux, outside Paris. One group of ministers, intoxicated, formed a chorus and serenaded Thiers outside his window. He opened the window and showed them his rear end. Reports of the event soon appeared in the press in France and across Europe, and did not improve Thiers&#x27; reputation with the Paris aristocracy. In appearance, Thiers was very short, barely appearing over the tribune in the Assembly. It was lowered slightly when he became president to make him more visible. His voice was harsh, and he spoke with a pronounced Provençal accent. Despite this, after a great deal of practice, he developed a conversational, direct style, and became a very effective public speaker. His opponents tried every way they could to prevent him from speaking, with little success.

==Literary career==

Thiers was just one example of 19th century French writers who also had prominent political careers. Others were Victor Hugo, Alphonse de Lamartine, and Alexis de Tocqueville; but Thiers was the only writer who reached the highest level of the French state. His major literary works were his ten-volume history of the French Revolution, and his twenty-volume history of the following period, the Consulate and Empire of Napoleon I. Both works were filled with Thiers&#x27; personal opinions and judgments, but also benefited from his personal access to many of the participants, including his political mentor, Talleyrand, and Napoleon&#x27;s surviving generals. 

The first work, on the French Revolution, published between 1823 and 1827, was highly praised by French critics. It was the first major history in French of the Revolution, and won Thiers a seat as the second-youngest elected member of the Académie Française, and in addition was a major commercial success. It condemned the violence of the Terror and the most radical leaders, including Marat, Robespierre, and Saint-Just, and glorified the ideals and the more moderate leaders of the French Revolution, including Mirabeau, Bailly and Lafayette, though at the time the book was published France was still a monarchy, and the singing of the Marseillaise was still forbidden. The books did much to undermine public support for the last Bourbon king, overthrown in the Revolution of 1830.

His second major work was his enormous &quot;History of the Consulate and the Empire&quot;, in twenty volumes, published between 1845 and 1862. Like the history of the Revolution, it was a critical and popular success in France, published at a time when the French public was looking for heroes. It sold 50,000 complete sets of the book. An American professor of French literature, O.B. Super, wrote a foreword to an American edition of the volume of Thiers&#x27; book on the Battle of Waterloo, published in 1902. He wrote: &quot;Thiers&#x27; style is characterized by brilliant and dramatic descriptions and a liberal and tolerant spirit, but he is at times deficient in rigorous historical accuracy, and owing to the intense national feeling of the writer, his admiration for Napoleon sometimes gets the better of his judgement. Thiers did more than any other Frenchman to keep alive in France &quot;la légende napoléonienne&quot;, which made possible the second empire with all its disastrous consequences for France.&quot; Thiers&#x27; account of the French invasion of Russia was sharply criticized by Leo Tolstoy for its factual inaccuracies and &quot;general high-flown, pompous style, devoid of any direct meaning.&quot; Thiers also wrote a history of the 1830 Revolution, in which he played an important part, and a memoir, called &quot;Souvenirs&quot;. His speeches were collected by his widow and published after his death.

==Place in history==
Contemporary judgements about the place of Thiers in history depended largely upon the politics of those doing the judging. Among the most virulent critics of Thiers was Karl Marx, who had been forced to leave Paris when Thiers was head of the French government. In 1871, he described Thiers as &quot;that monstrous gnome, [who] has charmed the French &quot;bourgeoisie&quot; for almost half a century, because he is the most consummate intellectual expression of their own class corruption. ... Thiers was consistent only in his greed for wealth and his hatred of the men that produce it.&quot;

Victor Hugo lavishly praised Thiers when Thiers supported him in gaining a seat in the Académie Française, but later, when a candidate backed by Thiers defeated Hugo for a seat in the Assembly, Hugo wrote: &quot;I have always felt for that celebrated statesman, eminent orator, that mediocre writer, that man with a narrow and small heart, an undefinable sentiment of admiration, aversion and disdain.&quot; Nonetheless, Hugo, along with Léon Gambetta, led the procession of mourners at Thiers&#x27; funeral. Thiers achieved a place in French literature as the model for Eugène de Rastignac, one of the main characters in the &quot;La Comédie humaine&quot; of Honoré de Balzac. The character appears in twenty-eight of Balzac&#x27;s novels. Rastignac&#x27;s rapid rise from poverty to success in finance and politics, and his unusual family life, parallel those of Thiers.

Following the death of Thiers, Gustave Flaubert wrote about the massive crowds that appeared at his funeral. &quot;This truly national demonstration greatly struck me. I did not like this king of the bourgeois, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. Compared with the others who surrounded him, he was a giant, and in addition he had one great virtue: patriotism. No one better summed up France better than he did. That was the reason for the huge effect of his death.&quot; Another historian, Maxime du Camp wrote after Thiers&#x27; funeral: &quot;Certainly people laughed at his contradictions, and during his lifetime he was not spared mockery, but he continued to be respected, because he passionately loved France. In times of good fortune, he dreamed of a France that was great, strong, and respected; and when France was bent under the weight of misfortune which its faults had brought upon it, he made a superhuman effort to save it and to make it less miserable. This pleads in his favor and should earn him the indulgence of the future.

The historian George Saintsbury gave this assessment of Thiers: &quot;His constant tendency to inflame the aggressive and chauvinistic spirit of his country was not based on any sound estimate of the relative power and interests of France, and led his country more than once to the verge of a great calamity. In opposition, both under Louis Philippe and under the empire, and even to some extent in the last four years of his life, his worst qualities were always evident. But with all these drawbacks he conquered and will retain a place in what is perhaps the highest, as it is certainly the smallest, class of statesmen: the class of those to whom their country has had recourse in a great disaster, who have shown in bringing her through that disaster with constancy, courage, devotion and skill and have been rewarded by as much success as the occasion permitted.&quot;

After the student-worker uprising in Paris of May 1968, and during the presidency of the socialist François Mitterrand in the 1980s and 1990s, Thiers&#x27; reputation reached a low point; the new government renamed several Paris streets, squares and metro station for the revolutionary leaders of the Paris Commune, while historians of the left blamed Thiers for lack of attention to social issues and especially for the suppression of the Commune.

In 1983, the historian René de La Croix de Castries summarized the career of Thiers this way: &quot;Thiers was essentially an ambitious man and an egoist. He never thought of anything except his own career, and he imagined reaching the highest level. He wanted to be at the top, which from the very beginning led him naturally to desire one day to be head of state; a dream that for a long time was not practical, because there was a monarchy or an empire. When he did have a chance to try in 1848, he thought it was more judicious to support Louis-Napoleon. It was thus an extraordinary circumstance that he could actually achieve his dream in 1871, at the age of seventy-four, an age which considerably passed the average life expectancy of that time... The work of Thiers did not include a single social law. On this point, he was truly a &quot;bourgeois&quot; of the 19th century, insensible to the miseries of the working class and not hesitant to open fire on the masses when the public order was threatened. To him belongs the glory of having brought an end to the German occupation, and to have given to a humiliated France the desire to live again. But if he earned admiration, he did not inspire much sympathy. Thiers was nothing less than the summary of French politics in the 19th century.&quot;

The historian Pierre Guiral wrote in: &quot;Adolphe Thiers, ou, De la nécessite en politique&quot; in 1986: &quot;He was a founder, the Washington of France, a man full of weaknesses but an uncontested patriot. He expelled the Prussians from France (in the Franco-Prussian War). From the July Revolution, when he founded the journal called &#x27;The National&#x27;, to 1871, when he defended the nation against divisions which threatened to destroy it, he was national.&quot;

==Legacy==
The reconstructed Hôtel Thiers on Place Saint-Georges in Paris became, after his death, the headquarters of the Fondation Dosne-Thiers, which now is part of Institute of France. It contains his library, his archives and a collection of personal effects. it can be consulted by requesting permission from the Institute of France. The house is also a regular venue for concerts of chamber music.

Thiers was responsible for the construction of Napoleon&#x27;s tomb at Les Invalides, and for the completion of the column on Place Vendôme and the Arc de Triomphe, both of which he dedicated. Thiers also built the ring of fortifications around Paris known as the Thiers Wall, of which a few traces can still be seen. The location of the wall now marks the city limits of Paris.

A small street and square in the 16th arrondissement in Paris are named for Thiers. There are streets and squares named for Thiers in Bordeaux, Nancy, Tours, Fontainebleau, Melun, Meudon, Chaumont, Graion, and his native Aix-en-Provence, and there is a Lycée Thiers in Marseille. There were formerly statues of Thiers in a number of French towns, including Nancy and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, but some were removed in the 1970s and 1980s.

<doc id="192011" wikidata="Q4801213" url="?curid=192011" title="Artist's proof">
<text>An artist&#x27;s proof is an impression of a print taken in the printmaking process to see the current printing state of a plate while the plate (or stone, or woodblock) is being worked on by the artist. A proof may show a clearly incomplete image, often called a &quot;working proof&quot; or &quot;trial impression&quot;, but in modern practice is usually used to describe an impression of the finished work that is identical to the numbered copies. There can also be &quot;printer&#x27;s proofs&quot; which are taken for the printer to see how the image is printing, or are final impressions the printer is allowed to keep.

Artist&#x27;s proofs are not included in the count of a limited edition, and sometimes the number of artist&#x27;s proofs, which belong to the artist, can be twenty or more. By convention, the artist is not supposed to sell these at once. However, some artists use it as a method of re-issuing an edition that has sold out, marking such editions for example &#x27;Artist&#x27;s Proof no.8 of 50.&#x27;

==History==

The term &quot;proof&quot; is generally, but not consistently, applied only to prints from the late eighteenth-century onwards, beginning with the English mezzotinters, who began the practice of issuing small editions of proofs for collectors, often before the &quot;lettering&quot; or inscription below the image was added. The practices of signing or numbering impressions in the main edition had not begun, and in the absence of this, it is normally only when the image is clearly different from the final form that the term proof has any meaning.

In old master prints, a proof will be described as belonging to a different state of the print. States are numbered I, II, III etc., in the sequence they were produced, which can normally be determined.

For example, Rembrandt, who had his own printing-press and printed at least the earliest copies of his etchings himself, was a great taker of proofs, but these are normally described as different states - his record was nine for one etching, although this involved returning to an older print he had sold many copies of, and largely reworking it.

But the term proof can be used in the case of a clear working proof of an old master print, like the two impressions of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; (1504, British Museum and Albertina, Vienna) which show the figures largely finished but the background with only the main outlines lightly done.

== Status ==

Art historians, curators, and collectors view working proofs as especially desirable because of their rarity, the insight they may give into the progress of the work, and because they may well have belonged to the artist. Especially in the case of dead artists, they can be the only evidence of the artist&#x27;s incremental development of an image, something not usually available with drawings, paintings, or sculpture. Some lithographs may be hand signed in the border and labeled &quot;Epreuve D&#x27;Artiste&quot;, which means Artist&#x27;s Proof, which also increases its value.

Collectors also usually prefer final artist&#x27;s proofs even when they are identical to the main edition; if nothing else the print may have been presented to a friend by the artist. Prints are generally sold as limited editions, with a print being cheaper than a drawing or painting because the artist/gallery makes more money by selling multiples. An artist&#x27;s proof has special value because of its extra rarity and its possible differences from the &quot;standard&quot; print, factors that are often reflected in its price.

== Printshop technicians ==

Since many printmaking processes require expensive equipment, most artists choose to work with specialist printers. The print shop provides technicians skilled in the process; the artist provides the art. It is customary in these cases to pay the technicians with a signed artist&#x27;s proof, in addition to his wages. The print shop will also retain a proof, normally signed off as &quot;bon à tirer&quot; (&quot;good for printing&quot; in French) to use as a control example against which the other impressions are compared. This has resulted in some very impressive collections of prints owned by printmakers themselves.

An artist&#x27;s proof is also known as a &quot;comp&quot; or &quot;complimentary&quot; if given to printers.

<text>A saw is a tool consisting of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge used to cut through material. Various terms are used to describe toothed and abrasive saws.

Saws began as serrated materials, and when mankind learned how to use iron, it became the preferred material for saw blades of all kinds. There are numerous types of hand saws and mechanical saws, and different types of blades and cuts.

== Description ==
A saw is a tool consisting of a tough blade, wire, or chain with a hard toothed edge. It is used to cut through material, very often wood, though sometimes metal or stone.

== Terminology ==
A number of terms are used to describe saws.

=== Kerf ===
 The narrow channel left behind by the saw and (relatedly) the measure of its width is known as the kerf. As such, it also refers to the wasted material that is turned into sawdust, and becomes a factor in measurements when making cuts. For example, cutting an 8-foot (2.4 meter) piece of wood into 1 foot (30 cm) sections, with 1/8 inch (3 mm) kerf will produce only seven sections, plus one that is 7/8 inch (21 mm) too short when factoring in the kerf from all the cuts. The kerf depends on several factors: the width of the saw blade; the set of the blade&#x27;s teeth; the amount of wobble created during cutting; and the amount of material pulled out of the sides of the cut. Although the term &quot;kerf&quot; is often used informally, to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade, or to the width of the set, this can be misleading, because blades with the same thickness and set may create different kerfs. For example, a too-thin blade can cause excessive wobble, creating a wider-than-expected kerf. The kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter. The kerf left behind by a laser beam can be changed based on the laser&#x27;s power and type of material being cut.

=== Toothed saws ===
A toothed saw or tooth saw has a hard toothed edge. The cut is made by placing the toothed edge against the material and moving it back and forth, or continuously forward. This force may be applied by hand, or powered by steam, water, electricity or other power source.

==== Frequency of teeth ====
The most common measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade is &quot;point per inch&quot; (25 mm). It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then counting the number of points between the zero mark and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the zero mark and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point per inch than there are teeth per inch (e.g., a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 teeth per inch, and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 teeth per inch). Some saws do not have the same number of teeth per inch throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the saw cut easier.

An alternative measurement of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade is &quot;teeth per inch&quot;. Usually abbreviated TPI, as in, &quot;a blade consisting of 18TPI.&quot; (cf. points per inch.)

==== Set ====
&quot;Set&quot; is the degree to which the teeth are bent out sideways away from the blade, usually in both directions. In most modern serrated saws, the teeth are set, so that the kerf (the width of the cut) will be wider than the blade itself. This allows the blade to move through the cut easily without &quot;binding&quot; (getting stuck). The set may be different depending on the kind of cut the saw is intended to make. For example, a ripsaw has a tooth set that is similar to the angle used on a chisel, so that it rips or tears the material apart. A &quot;flush-cutting saw&quot; has no set on one side, so that the saw can be laid flat on a surface and cut along that surface without scratching it. The set of the blade&#x27;s teeth can be adjusted with a tool called a saw set.

==== Other toothed saw terms ====
* Back: The edge opposite the toothed edge.
* Fleam: The angle of the faces of the teeth relative to a line perpendicular to the face of the saw.
* Gullet: The valley between the points of the teeth.
* Heel: The end closest to the handle.
* Rake: The angle of the front face of the tooth relative to a line perpendicular to the length of the saw. Teeth designed to cut with the grain (&quot;ripping&quot;) are generally steeper than teeth designed to cut across the grain (&quot;crosscutting&quot;)
* Teeth: Sharp protrusions along the cutting side of the saw.
* Toe: The end farthest from the handle.
* Toothed edge: the edge with the teeth (on some saws both edges are toothed).
* Web: a narrow saw blade held in a frame, worked either by hand or in a machine, sometimes with teeth on both edges

=== Abrasive saws ===

An abrasive saw has a powered circular blade designed to cut through metal or ceramic.

== History ==

Saws were at first serrated materials such as flint, obsidian, sea shells and shark teeth.

Serrated tools with indications that they were used to cut wood were found at Pech-de-l&#x27;Azé caveIV in France. These tools date to 90,000-30,000 years BCE.
In ancient Egypt, open (unframed) pull saws made of copper are documented as early as the Early Dynastic Period, –2,686 BC. Many copper saws were found in tomb No. 3471 dating to the reign of Djer in the 31st century BC. Saws were used for cutting a variety of materials, including humans (death by sawing), and models of saws were used in many contexts throughout Egyptian history. Particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show the sizes and use of different types of saws. Egyptian saws were at first serrated, hardened copper which may have cut on both pull and push strokes. As the saw developed, teeth were raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side, rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set. Saws were also made of bronze and later iron. In the Iron Age, frame saws were developed holding the thin blades in tension. The earliest known sawmill is the Roman Hierapolis sawmill from the third century AD and was for sawing stone.

According to Chinese legend, the saw was invented by Lu Ban. In Greek mythology, as recounted by Ovid, Talos, the nephew of Daedalus, invented the saw. In archeological reality, saws date back to prehistory and most probably evolved from Neolithic stone or bone tools. &quot;[T]he identities of the axe, adz, chisel, and saw were clearly established more than 4,000 years ago.&quot;

=== Manufacture of saws by hand ===
Once mankind had learned how to use iron, it became the preferred material for saw blades of all kinds; some cultures learned how to harden the surface (&quot;case hardening&quot; or &quot;steeling&quot;), prolonging the blade&#x27;s life and sharpness.

Steel, made of iron with moderate carbon content and hardened by quenching hot steel in water, was used as early as 1200 BC. By the end of the 17th century European manufacture centred on Germany, (the Bergisches Land) in London, and the Midlands of England. Most blades were made of steel (iron carbonised and re-forged by different methods). In the mid 18th century a superior form of completely melted steel (&quot;crucible cast&quot;) began to be made in Sheffield, England, and this rapidly became the preferred material, due to its hardness, ductility, springiness and ability to take a fine polish. A small saw industry survived in London and Birmingham, but by the 1820s the industry was growing rapidly and increasingly concentrated in Sheffield, which remained the largest centre of production, with over 50% of the nation&#x27;s saw makers. The US industry began to overtake it in the last decades of the century, due to superior mechanisation, better marketing, a large domestic market, and the imposition of high tariffs on imports. Highly productive industries continued in Germany and France.
Early European saws were made from a heated sheet of iron or steel, produced by flattening by several men simultaneously hammering on an anvil. After cooling, the teeth were punched out one at a time with a die, the size varying with the size of the saw. The teeth were sharpened with a triangular file of appropriate size, and set with a hammer or a wrest. By the mid 18th century rolling the metal was usual, the power for the rolls being supplied first by water, and increasingly by the early 19th century by steam engines. The industry gradually mechanized all the processes, including the important grinding the saw plate &quot;thin to the back&quot; by a fraction of an inch, which helped the saw to pass through the kerf without binding. The use of steel added the need to harden and temper the saw plate, to grind it flat, to smith it by hand hammering and ensure the springiness and resistance to bending deformity, and finally to polish it.

Most hand saws are today entirely made without human intervention, with the steel plate supplied ready rolled to thickness and tensioned before being cut to shape by laser. The teeth are shaped and sharpened by grinding and are flame hardened to obviate (and actually prevent) sharpening once they have become blunt. A large measure of hand finishing remains to this day for quality saws by the very few specialist makers reproducing the 19th century designs.

=== Pit saws ===

A pit saw was a two-man ripsaw. In parts of early colonial North America, it was one of the principal tools used in shipyards and other industries where water-powered sawmills were not available. It was so-named because it was typically operated over a saw pit, either at ground level or on trestles across which logs that were to be cut into boards. The pit saw was &quot;a strong steel cutting-plate, of great breadth, with large teeth, highly polished and thoroughly wrought, some eight or ten feet in length&quot; with either a handle on each end or a frame saw. A pit-saw was also sometimes known as a whipsaw. It took 2-4 people to operate. A &quot;pit-man&quot; stood in the pit, a &quot;top-man&quot; stood outside the pit, and they worked together to make cuts, guide the saw, and raise it. Pit-saw workers were among the most highly paid laborers in early colonial North America.

== Types of saws ==
=== Hand saws ===

Hand saws typically have a relatively thick blade to make them stiff enough to cut through material. (The pull stroke also reduces the amount of stiffness required.) Thin-bladed handsaws are made stiff enough either by holding them in tension in a frame, or by backing them with a folded strip of steel (formerly iron) or brass (on account of which the latter are called &quot;back saws.&quot;) Some examples of hand saws are:
* Artillery saw, Chain saw, Portable link saw: a flexible chain saw up to 122 cm (four feet) long, supplied to the military for clearing tree branches for gun sighting;
* Butcher&#x27;s saw: for cutting bone; many different designs were common, including a large one for two men, known in the US as a beef-splitter; most were frame saws, some backsaws;
* Crosscut saw: for cutting wood perpendicular to the grain;
* Docking saw: a large, heavy saw with an unbreakable metal handle of unique pattern, used for rough work
* Farmer&#x27;s/Miner&#x27;s saw: a strong saw with coarse teeth;
* Felloe saw;: the narrowest-bladed variety of pit saw, up to 213 cm (7 feet) long and able to work the sharp curves of cart wheel felloes; a slightly wider blade, equally long, was called a stave saw, for cutting the staves for wooden casks;
* Floorboard/flooring saw: a small saw, rarely with a back, and usually with the teeth continued onto the back at the toe for a short distance; used by house carpenters for cutting across a floor board without damaging its neighbour;
* Grafting/grafter/table saw; a hand saw with a tapering narrow blade from 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 inches) long; the origins of the terms are obscure
* Ice saw: either of pit saw design without a bottom tiller, or a large handsaw, always with very coarse teeth, for harvesting ice to be used away from source, or stored for use in warmer weather;
* Japanese saw or pull saw: a thin-bladed saw that cuts on the pull stroke, and with teeth of different design to European or American traditional forms;
* Keyhole saw or compass saw: a narrow-bladed saw, sharply tapered thin to the back to cut round curves, with one end fixed in a handle;
* Musical saw, a hand saw, possibly with the teeth filed off, used as a musical instrument.
* Nest of saws: three or four interchangeable blades fitted to a handle with screws or quick-release nuts;
* One-man cross cut saw: a coarse-toothed saw of 76 to 152 cm (30-60 inches) length for rough or green timber; a second, turned, handle could be added at the heel or the toe for a second operator;
* Pad saw: a short narrow blade held in a wooden or metal handle (the pad);
* Panel saw: a lighter variety of handsaw, usually less than 61 cm (24 inches) long and having finer teeth;
* Plywood saw: a fine-toothed saw (to reduce tearing), for cutting plywood
* Polesaw: a saw blade attached to a long handle
* Pruning saw: the commonest variety has a 30-71 cm (12-28 inch) blade, toothed on both edges, one tooth pattern being considerably coarser than the other;
* Ripsaw: for cutting wood along the grain;
* Rule saw or combination saw: a handsaw with a measuring scale along the back and a handle making a 90° square with the scaled edge;
* Salt saw: a short hand saw with a non-corroding zinc or copper blade, used for cutting a block of salt at a time when it was supplied to large kitchens in that form;
* Turkish saw or monkey saw: a small saw with a parallel-sided blade, designed to cut on the pull stroke;
* Two-man saw: a general term for a large crosscut saw or ripsaw for cutting large logs or trees;
* Veneer saw: a two-edged saw with fine teeth for cutting veneer;
* Wire saw: a toothed or coarse cable or wire wrapped around the material and pulled back and forth.

==== Back saws ====

&quot;Back saws&quot; which have a thin blade backed with steel or brass to maintain rigidity, are a subset of hand saws. Back saws have different names depending on the length of the blade; &quot;tenon saw&quot; (from use in making mortise and tenon joints) is often used as a generic name for all the sizes of woodworking backsaw. Some examples are:
* Bead saw/gent&#x27;s saw/jeweller&#x27;s saw: a small backsaw with a turned wooden handle;
* Blitz saw: a small backsaw, for cutting wood or metal, with a hook at the toe for the thumb of the non-dominant hand;
* Carcase saw: a term used until the 20th century for backsaws with long blades;
* Dovetail saw: a backsaw with a blade of length, for cutting intricate joints in cabinet making work;
* Electrician&#x27;s saw: a very small backsaw used in the early 20th century on the wooden capping and casing in which electric wiring was run;
* Flush-cutting saw/offset saw: a backsaw with a flat side and a handle offset toward the opposite side, usually reversible, for cutting flush to a surface such as a floor;
* Mitre-box saw: a saw with a blade long, held in an adjustable frame (the mitre box) for making accurate crosscuts and mitres in a workplace;
* Sash saw: a backsaw of blade length .

==== Frame saws ====

A class of saws for cutting all types of material; they may be small or large and the frame may be wood or metal.
* Bow saw, turning saw, or buck saw: a saw with a narrow blade held in tension in a frame; the blade can usually be rotated and may be toothed on both edges; it may be a rip or a crosscut, and was the preferred form of hand saw for continental European woodworkers until superseded by machines;
* Coping saw: a saw with a very narrow blade held in a metal frame in which it can usually be rotated, for cutting wood patterns;
* Felloe saw; a pit saw with a narrow tapering blade for sawing out the felloes of wooden cart wheels
* Fretsaw: a saw with a very narrow blade which can be rotated, held in a deep metal frame, for cutting intricate wood patterns such as jigsaw puzzles;
* Girder saw: a large hack saw with a deep frame;
* Hacksaw/bow saw for iron: a fine-toothed blade held in a frame, for cutting metal and other hard materials;
* Pit saw/sash saw/whip saw: large wooden-framed saws for converting timber to lumber, with blades of various widths and lengths up to 305 cm (10 feet); the timber is supported over a pit or raised on trestles; other designs are open-bladed;
* Stave saw: a narrow tapering-bladed pit saw for sawing out staves for wooden casks;
* Surgeon&#x27;s/surgical saw/Bone cutter: for cutting bone during surgical procedures; some designs are framed, others have an open blade with a characteristic shape of the toe.

=== Mechanically powered saws ===
==== Circular-blade saws ====

* Circular saw: a saw with a circular blade which spins. Circular saws can be large for use in a mill or hand held up to 24&quot; blades and different designs cut almost any kind of material including wood, stone, brick, plastic, etc.
* Table saw: a saw with a circular blade rising through a slot in a table. If it has a direct-drive blade small enough to set on a workbench, it is called a &quot;workbench&quot; or &quot;jobsite&quot; saw. If set on steel legs, it is called a &quot;contractor&#x27;s saw.&quot; A heavier, more precise and powerful version, driven by several belts, with an enclosed base stand, is called a &quot;cabinet saw.&quot; A newer version, combining the lighter-weight mechanism of a contractor&#x27;s saw with the enclosed base stand of a cabinet saw, is called a &quot;hybrid saw.&quot;
* Radial arm saw: a versatile machine, mainly for cross-cutting. The blade is pulled on a guide arm through a piece of wood that is held stationary on the saw&#x27;s table.
* Rotary saw or &quot;spiral-cut saw&quot; or &quot;RotoZip&quot;: for making accurate cuts, without using a pilot hole, in wallboard, plywood, and other thin materials.
* Electric miter saw or &quot;chop saw,&quot; or &quot;cut-off saw&quot; or &quot;power miter box&quot;: for making accurate cross cuts and miter cuts. The basic version has a circular blade fixed at a 90° angle to the vertical. A &quot;compound miter saw&quot; has a blade that can be adjusted to other angles. A &quot;sliding compound miter saw&quot; has a blade that can be pulled through the work, in an action similar to that of a radial-arm saw, which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces.
* Concrete saw: (usually powered by an internal combustion engine and fitted with a Diamond Blade) for cutting concrete or asphalt pavement.
* Pendulum saw or &quot;swing saw&quot;: a saw hung on a swinging arm, for the rough cross cutting of wood in a sawmill and for cutting ice out of a frozen river.
* Abrasive saw: a circular or reciprocating saw-like tool with an abrasive disc rather than a toothed blade, commonly used for cutting very hard materials. As it does not have regularly shaped edges the abrasive saw is not a saw in technical terms.
* Hole saw: ring-shaped saw to attach to a power drill, used for cutting a circular hole in material.

==== Reciprocating blade saws ====
* Dragsaw: for bucking logs (used before the invention of the chainsaw).
* Frame saw or sash saw: A thin bladed rip-saw held in tension by a frame used both manually and in sawmills. Some whipsaws are frame saws and some have a heavy blade which does not need a frame called a mulay or muley saw.
* Ice saw: for ice cutting. Looks like a mulay saw but sharpened as a cross-cut saw.
* Jigsaw or &quot;saber saw&quot; (US): narrow-bladed saw, for cutting irregular shapes. (Also an old term for what is now more commonly called a &quot;scroll saw.&quot;)
* Power hacksaw or electric hacksaw: a saw for cutting metal, with a frame like a normal hacksaw.
* Reciprocating saw or &quot;sabre saw&quot; (UK and Australia): a saw with an &quot;in-and-out&quot; or &quot;up-and-down&quot; action similar to a jigsaw, but larger and more powerful, and using a longer stroke with the blade parallel to the barrel. Hand-held versions, sometimes powered by compressed air, are for demolition work or for cutting pipe.
* Scroll saw: for making intricate curved cuts (&quot;scrolls&quot;).
* Sternal saw: for cutting through a patient&#x27;s sternum during surgery.

==== Continuous band ====
* Band saw: a ripsaw on a motor-driven continuous band. Portable sawmills are typically band saw mills.

==== Chainsaws ====
* Chainsaw: an engine-driven saw with teeth on a chain normally used as a cross-cut saw.
* Chainsaw mill: a chainsaw with a special saw chain and guide system for use as a rip-saw.

== Types of blades and blade cuts ==
Most blade teeth are made either of tool steel or carbide. Carbide is harder and holds a sharp edge much longer.
; Band saw blade: A long band welded into a circle, with teeth on one side. Compared to a circular-saw blade, it produces less waste because it is thinner, dissipates heat better because it is longer (so there is more blade to do the cutting, and is usually run at a slower speed.
; Crosscut: In woodworking, a cut made at (or close to) a right angle to the direction of the wood grain of the workpiece. A crosscut saw is used to make this type of cut.
; Rip cut: In woodworking, a cut made parallel to the direction of the grain of the workpiece. A ripsaw is used to make this type of cut.
; Plytooth blade: A circular saw blade with many small teeth, designed for cutting plywood with minimal splintering.
; Dado blade: A special type of circular saw blade used for making wide-grooved cuts in wood so that the edge of another piece of wood will fit into the groove to make a joint. Some dado blades can be adjusted to make different-width grooves. A &quot;stacked&quot; dado blade, consisting of chipper blades between two dado blades, can make different-width grooves by adding or removing chipper blades. An &quot;adjustable&quot; dado blade has a movable locking cam mechanism to adjust the degree to which the blade wobbles sideways, allowing continuously variable groove widths from the lower to upper design limits of the dado.
; Strobe saw blade: A circular saw blade with special rakers/cutters to easily saw through green or uncured wood that tends to jam other kinds of saw blades.

== Materials used for saws ==
There are several materials used in saws, with each of its own specifications.
;Brass: Used only for the reinforcing folded strip along the back of backsaws, and to make the screws that in earlier times held the blade to the handle.
;Iron: Used for blades and for the reinforcing strip on cheaper backsaws until superseded by steel.
;Zinc: Used only for saws made to cut blocks of salt, as formerly used in kitchens
;Copper: Used as an alternative to zinc for salt-cutting saws
;Steel: Used in almost every existing kind of saw. Because steel is cheap, easy to shape, and very strong, it has the right properties for most kind of saws.
;Diamond: Fixed onto the saw blade&#x27;s base to form diamond saw blades. As diamond is a superhard material, diamond saw blades can be used to cut hard brittle or abrasive materials, for example, stone, concrete, asphalt, bricks, ceramics, glass, semiconductor and gem stone. There are many methods used to fix the diamonds onto the blades&#x27; base and there are various kinds of diamond saw blades for different purposes.
;High-speed steel (HSS): The whole saw blade is made of High-Speed Steel (HSS). HSS saw blades are mainly used to cut steel, copper, aluminum and other metal materials. If high-strength steels (e.g., stainless steel) are to be cut, the blades made of cobalt HSS (e.g. M35, M42) should be used.
;Tungsten carbide: Normally, there are two ways to use tungsten carbide to make saw blades:
:;Carbide-tipped saw blades: The saw blade&#x27;s teeth are tipped (via welding) with small pieces of sharp tungsten carbide block. This type of blade is also called TCT (Tungsten Carbide-Tipped) saw blade. Carbide-tipped saw blades are widely used to cut wood, plywood, laminated board, plastic, glass, aluminum and some other metals.
:;Solid-carbide saw blades: The whole saw blade is made of tungsten carbide. Comparing with HSS saw blades, solid-carbide saw blades have higher hardness under high temperatures, and are more durable, but they also have a lower toughness.

== Uses ==

* Saws are commonly used for cutting hard materials. They are used extensively in forestry, construction, demolition, medicine, and hunting.
* Musical saws are used as instruments to make music.
* Chainsaw carving is a flourishing modern art form. Special saws have been developed for the purpose.
* The production of lumber, lengths of squared wood for use in construction, begins with the felling of trees and the transportation of the logs to a sawmill.
** Plainsawing: Lumber that will be used in structures is typically plainsawn (also called flatsawn), a method of dividing the log that produces the maximum yield of useful pieces and therefore the greatest economy.
** Quarter sawing: This sawing method produces edge-grain or vertical grain lumber, in which annual growth rings run more consistently perpendicular to the pieces&#x27; wider faces.

<doc id="192014" wikidata="Q1704704" url="?curid=192014" title="Leitmotif (album)">
<text>Leitmotif is the debut studio album by American rock band Dredg. The album was originally self-released on May 30, 1999, through the band&#x27;s own label, Woven Recordings, before being nationally re-released in the United States by Interscope Records, with different artwork, on September 11, 2001. A &quot;leitmotif&quot; is also a recurring musical theme associated within a particular piece of music with a particular person, place, or idea. The album is currently out of print.

==Content==
&quot;Leitmotif&quot; was recorded in ten days.

Interscope Records re-released &quot;Leitmotif&quot; unchanged from its original version, both in the recording and in the booklet&#x27;s text, essentially duplicating the band&#x27;s original, independently released demo.

The newer case features the uniform brown paper package with white text as pictured, to the lower right, with only the phrase &quot;We live like penguins in the desert. Why can&#x27;t we live like tribes?&quot; printed on the inner sleeve; a phrase used in the lyrics to &quot;Triangle&quot; on Dredg&#x27;s next album, &quot;El Cielo&quot;. The older case features the cover pictured, to the upper right, as well as more brown and blue topographical photos on the case and the booklet which are similar to the cover. Aside from the difference in artwork, the two versions of &quot;Leitmotif&quot; remain nearly identical.

Most of the lyrics can be found at Traversing ; the lyrics to parts of several verses (and most of one whole song) are unknown outside the band. All the music found on this album is created by Dredg; there are no samples. As claimed in the booklet, &quot;all instruments and sounds are real. No samples.&quot;

&quot;Leitmotif&quot; was produced and engineered by Dredg and Travis Crenshaw, and was recorded at Brilliant Studios in San Francisco, CA.

In May 2010, to celebrate the album&#x27;s 11th birthday, the band re-released a limited edition of the album on vinyl, with only 500 copies produced. In addition, the band performed the album in its entirety during the tour dates surrounding the anniversary. During the live performance of the album, Gus Lyndon Farwell, who sang the operatic parts on track 6, &quot;Movement III: Lyndon&quot;, on the original recording, made a guest appearance on the song.

== Track listing ==
*The track list on the back of the album simply lists the name of the first track as a variation of the Chinese character, 易 (pinyin: yì), which means &quot;change&quot;. However, since this character is not in the English language, most sources simply list the title as &quot;Symbol Song&quot; (including the band&#x27;s official website). The song starts after eight seconds of silence.

<text>El Cielo is the second album from the American progressive/alternative rock band, dredg. It was released on October 8, 2002, by Interscope Records. Like dredg&#x27;s first album, &quot;Leitmotif&quot;, &quot;El Cielo&quot; is a concept album. The title can be translated to mean &quot;the sky&quot; or &quot;the heaven&quot; in Spanish, and to mean &quot;peace and freedom of expression&quot; in dreams.

==Recording==
The album was recorded at George Lucas&#x27; Skywalker Ranch in Nicasio, CA, and at Long View Farm in North Brookfield, MA. Producers included Ron St. Germain, Tim Palmer, and Michael Rosen.

&quot;El Cielo&quot; has also been released in the SACD format. This particular disc is a multi-channel hybrid SACD. It is playable as a standard CD in a normal CD player. However, in an SACD player, the album is played in high resolution audio with surround sound.

===Song Details===
The song &quot;Brushstroke: Reprise&quot; can be divided in two parts, the first part is a 40-second alternate version of the song &quot;Same ol&#x27; Road&quot; (hence the title &quot;reprise&quot;). The second part is an extract from a song called &quot;Wind at the End&quot;, which was recorded by the band but not released on any studio album, EP, or DVD.

A demo of the song &quot;Of the Room&quot; appeared on their 2001 &quot;Industry Demos&quot; EP, and later on &quot;Extended Play for the Eastern Hemisphere&quot;.

== Inspiration ==
One of dredg&#x27;s main influences on the album, &quot;El Cielo&quot;, was a painting by Salvador Dalí entitled &quot;Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening&quot;, which is also what the acronym in the title &quot;Brushstroke: dcbtfoabaaposba&quot;, stands for (&quot;one&quot; second instead of &quot;a&quot; second). The painting clearly influences many of the album&#x27;s core themes and song titles. For example, in the painting there is a long-legged elephant (&quot;An Elephant In The Delta Waves&quot;) with a papal insignia upon its back. &quot;The Papal Insignia&quot; was a song recorded for &quot;El Cielo&quot; but only saw release of &quot;Industry Demos&quot;, recorded in 2001, and didn&#x27;t make it onto &quot;El Cielo&quot;. Also pictured in the painting is a woman lying in a canyon: &quot;The Canyon Behind Her&quot; is the title of the last song on the album.

This is further supported by the translation of the Japanese spoken words from the beginning of &quot;The Canyon Behind Her&quot;: &quot;This album was inspired by a painting titled &#x27;Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening&#x27;. It is recommended that you view this painting as you listen to El Cielo. It is as if one stimulus awakens other senses. In other words, it&#x27;s about &#x27;drawing music&#x27;&quot;.

Band members have also been quoted as saying that this Dalí painting symbolizes sleep paralysis, a literal representation of the condition from which Dalí&#x27;s wife actually suffered. The booklet with &quot;El Cielo&quot; contains letters written by sufferers of sleeping disorders with descriptions of various experiences with or relating to sleep paralysis. Singer/Songwriter Gavin Hayes incorporates and expands upon the material found in the booklet for the lyrics to the album.

== Packaging ==
Early pressings of &quot;El Cielo&quot; were in a digipack with pictures of clouds bordered by runes. Later pressings of &quot;El Cielo&quot; are in a jewel case. The cover of the later versions is the cover of the booklet, which is a sort of brown leathery texture with the band&#x27;s name and the album name on it (although jewel case versions with the &quot;clouds&quot; cover are known to exist). The image provided on this page is the cover of the digipack version. The booklet which came with versions featuring the &quot;clouds&quot; cover are in full color, the booklet included in copies featuring the &quot;brown leather&quot; cover are in black and white, except for the limited digipak version. This version has a clouds packaging with the brown leather booklet in full color. All releases of the album contain the same disc except for the limited jewel case version, which disc is yellow and white and the SACD version which is an all-white gold disc with blue writing.

==&quot;Crickets&quot;==
The Crickets DVD was a promotional item that was to be given away with copies of Dredg&#x27;s second album, &quot;El Cielo&quot;, on tour. It was first given away by band members during the March 2003 SnoCore tour. As this concert was not heavily advertised many fans were unaware the event was taking place, never receiving a copy. In an effort to make up for this, for a limited amount of time anyone who spent $50 or more at dredg&#x27;s webstore received a signed copy with their purchase.

The DVD consists of three sections. The first is the band&#x27;s Electronic Press Kit, the second a long video entitled &quot;An Elephant in Halong Bay&quot; which begins with the &quot;El Cielo&quot; track &quot;Brushstroke: An Elephant in the Delta Waves&quot; and ends with &quot;Halong Bay&quot;, a b-side from the &quot;El Cielo&quot; recording sessions. Around eight minutes of footage in between the two tracks shows various video clips of the band. Two other b-sides played during the videos include &quot;walter&#x27;s sound track&quot; &amp; &quot;birds&quot;. The third section of the DVD is the music video for &quot;Same ol&#x27; Road&quot;.

The DVD is now out of print.

<text>Shaw Brothers (HK) Limited () was the largest film production company in Hong Kong, operating from 1925 to 2011.

In 1925, three Shaw brothers—Runje, Runme, and Runde—founded Tianyi Film Company (also called &quot;Unique&quot;) in Shanghai, and established a film distribution base in Singapore, where Runme and their youngest brother, Run Run Shaw, managed the precursor to the parent company, Shaw Organisation. Runme and Run Run took over the film production business of its Hong Kong–based sister company, Shaw &amp; Sons Ltd; in 1958, a new company, &quot;Shaw Brothers,&quot; was set up. In the 1960s, Shaw Brothers established what was once the largest privately-owned studio in the world, Movietown.

The company&#x27;s most famous works include &quot;The Love Eterne&quot; (1963), &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot; (1966), &quot;The One-Armed Swordsman&quot; (1967), &quot;King Boxer&quot; (1972), &quot;Executioners from Shaolin&quot; (1977), &quot;The 36th Chamber of Shaolin&quot; and &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot; (both 1978).

Over the years, the film company produced around 1,000 films, some becoming the most popular and significant Chinese-language films of the period. It also popularized the kung fu genre of films. In 1987, the company suspended film production in order to concentrate on the television industry through its subsidiary, TVB. Film production resumed in limited capacity in 2009.

In 2011, Shaw Brothers was reorganized into the Clear Water Bay Land Company Limited; its film production business was taken over by other companies within the Shaw conglomerate. However, the company continues to remain active in producing TV shows under the Shaw Brothers name to this day as of 2022.

==History==

Prior to their involvement in the filmmaking business, the Shaw brothers were interested in opera and happened to own a theater in Shanghai; their father also owned a cinema. One of the plays in their theater, &quot;The Man from Shensi&quot;, was very popular. The Shaw brothers then bought their first camera, and Runje Shaw made this play into a silent film that turned out to be a success. Runje Shaw and his brothers Runde and Runme formed a film production company in 1925 in Shanghai called the Tianyi Film Company (also known as Unique). The company&#x27;s earliest films, &quot;New Leaf&quot; (立地成佛) and &quot;Heroine Li Feifei&quot; (女侠李飛飛), were shown in Shanghai in 1925.

A rival studio, Mingxing Film Company, formed a syndicate with five other Shanghai companies to monopolize the distribution and exhibition markets in order to exclude Tianyi films from being shown in theater chains in Shanghai and Southeast Asia. The brothers therefore became interested in forming their own network, and Runme Shaw, who was then the distribution manager, traveled to Singapore to establish a movie distribution business for Southeast Asia. Runme incorporated the Hai Seng Co. (海星, which later became the Shaw Brothers Pte Ltd) to distribute films made by Tianyi and other studios. In 1927, they operated their own cinema in Tanjong Pagar in Singapore, expanded in Malaya, and opened four cinemas there. The number of cinemas owned by the Shaw chain in Southeast Asia would eventually reach 200 by the 1970s before it declined. In 1928, Run Run Shaw moved to Singapore to assist Runme.

In 1931, the Tianyi Studio in Shanghai produced what is considered by some to be the first sound-on-film Chinese talkie, &quot;Spring on Stage&quot; (歌場春色). In 1932, they teamed up with Cantonese opera singer Sit Gok-Sin (薛覺先) to make the first Cantonese talkie, &quot;White Golden Dragon&quot; (白金龍). This film proved to be very successful, and in 1934, they established the Tianyi Studio (Hong Kong) in Kowloon to make Cantonese films. The move to Hong Kong was accelerated as the Nanjing government had issued a ban on martial arts films as well as Cantonese films, and two years later, they moved the entire film production operation from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Tianyi was reorganized into Nanyang (南洋) Productions with Runde Shaw as the studio head. They also announced plan for their first film production studio in Singapore in 1937 to make films in Malay; a studio was built in 1940 to make Malay and Cantonese films, followed by another called Singapore Film Studios in 1941 on Jalan Ampas. It produced Malay films under the studio named Malay Film Productions (formally incorporated in 1949) which lasted until 1967. The most prominent Malay actor, director and producer of this period was P. Ramlee.
The Shaw Brothers continued to expand but suffered a setback during the Second World War when the Japanese occupied Malaya and Singapore. After the war, they began to rebuild. In the 1950s, Nanyang started to switch film production from Cantonese to Mandarin as the communist takeover of mainland China had cut off the supply of Mandarin films to overseas Chinese communities. In this period, Nanyang Studio operated under the company name of Shaw and Sons Ltd. The Mandarin films of the 1950s were primarily &quot;wenyi&quot; films (文藝片) in a contemporary setting as well as a few period dramas. In 1957, Run Run Shaw moved to Hong Kong, set up a new company, Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd., and built a new studio at Clearwater Bay, which officially opened in 1961 as Movietown. In the mid-1960s, Movietown was the largest and best-equipped studio in Chinese filmmaking as well as the largest privately owned studio in the world, with 15 stages, two permanent sets, state-of-the-art film-making equipment and facilities, and 1,300 employees. Period and music dramas were popular in the 1960s, and later in the decade Kung fu films also became popular. Some of Shaw Brothers&#x27; most notable films were made in this period, including &quot;The Magnificent Concubine&quot;, &quot;The Love Eterne&quot;, as well as &quot;One-Armed Swordsman&quot;, which broke the box office records and some spawned multiple sequels. The studio popularized the kung-fu genre of films, which included &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot; and &quot;The 36th Chamber of Shaolin&quot; made in the 1970s. The 1960s was a period of intense rivalry between Shaw Brothers and Cathay Organisation, but eventually Shaw Brothers gained the upper hand and Cathay ceased film production in 1970. Sir Run Run Shaw became involved in television when TVB was launched in 1967. In 1969, Shaw Brothers (HK) issued shares and became a public listed company.

In the 1970s, Shaw Brothers faced a strong challenge from a new studio, Golden Harvest, which had considerable success internationally with the martial arts film, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; starring Bruce Lee. Shaw Brothers then also began to co-produce films with Western producers for the international market and invest in films such as &quot;Meteor&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. However, Shaw Brothers ceased film production in 1986 because of competition from Golden Harvest and increasing piracy, focusing instead on TV production. In 1986, Movietown became TV City, which was leased to TVB for TV production. In 1988, the company was reorganized under the umbrella of the Shaw Organization. In the 1990s, Shaw again started making a few films, but no longer on the same scale as before. Shaw has since relocated to a new site in Tseung Kwan O, Hong Kong.

==Legacy==

===Directors===
Shaw Brothers is noted for film directors such as King Hu, Lau Kar-leung, P. Ramlee and Chang Cheh. King Hu was an early director who is best remembered for his film, &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot;, a martial arts film which differed from those of Chang Cheh in that it featured a capable female protagonist and revolved around romance in the martial arts world, rather than fast-paced action and the tales of brotherhood which Chang Cheh would later popularize. Chang Cheh, who was more fond of the latter components, would go on to be Shaw Studio&#x27;s best-known director, with such films as &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot;, &quot;The Brave Archer&quot; (based on the works of Jin Yong), &quot;One-Armed Swordsman&quot;, and other classics of Wuxia and Wushu film. Almost equally as famous was fight-choreographer-turned-director Lau Kar-leung, who would produce such highly regarded kung fu films as &quot;The 36th Chamber of Shaolin&quot; and &quot;The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter,&quot; while P. Ramlee was known for Malay style romantics and comedy such as &quot;Nujum Pa&#x27; Belalang, Seniman Bujang Lapok&quot; and &quot;Do Re Mi.&quot;

=== Actors ===
Shaw Brothers was modeled after the classic Hollywood system, with hundreds of actors signed to exclusive contracts. While other studios rotated cast members, Shaw Brothers assigned certain groups of actors to work exclusively with certain directors.

Shaw Brothers productions during the late 1950s to early 1960s were dominated by actresses like Li Li-Hua, Ivy Ling Po, Linda Lin Dai, Betty Loh Ti, Li Ching in dramatic and romantic features. In particular, the Huangmei opera &quot;The Love Eterne&quot;, starring Ivy Ling Po and Betty Loh Ti and based on the &quot;Butterfly Lovers&quot; folk legend from the Jin Dynasty, is one of the highest-grossing features of the Shaw Studio. Its huge success is in part due to the ingenious casting of Ivy Ling Po, who was a relatively unknown supporting actress, as the male lead. In the story of &quot;Butterfly Lovers&quot;, the female lead, played by Betty Loh Ti, disguised herself as a male to attend college because social mingling between the sexes was forbidden. The film resonated with its audience, and reportedly some members of the audience in Hong Kong and Taiwan repeatedly bought tickets and watched the feature in theaters over and over again in 1962, with some having watched it over 20 times.

From the late 1960s onward, production of dramatic features was reduced in favor of martial arts features. The group of actors from the 1978 release, &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot;, and the subsequent series of films—known by the name the Venom Mob—were among the most memorable. They were Lo Mang, Lu Feng, Sun Chien, Chiang Sheng, and Kuo Chui, who had been stars in the Shaw Studio for years, but did not become memorable faces until &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot;. Wei Pai, who played the Snake (referred to as &quot;Number Two&quot; throughout the film &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot;), was also part of the &quot;Venom Mob&quot;, which numbered over 15 actors who appeared in almost all of the &quot;Venom&quot; movies.

In the first half of the 1970s, two other stars were particularly renowned and favored by the &quot;Million-Dollar Director&quot; Chang Cheh in his movies: Ti Lung and David Chiang. He is also accredited as a capable actor who reinforced his muscular glamor with strong characterization over his many films. Chiang, on the other hand, was slight and wiry and often played the sarcastic antihero to Lung&#x27;s standard archetype. Chang Cheh, with his stars Ti Lung and David Chiang, were known as the cinematic &quot;Iron Triangle&quot; throughout Southeast Asia. In the middle of that decade, the duo was overshadowed by the rise of Alexander Fu Sheng, who had played supporting roles opposite them on many occasions. Fu was killed in 1983 in a car accident, at age 28, ending a brief but spectacular career.

Members of the Peking Opera School, including Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, and Sammo Hung, played extras and bit parts in several Shaw Brothers films in the 1970s, although they were unknowns at the time.

Better-known female martial arts actresses of Shaw Brothers include Cheng Pei-pei, Lily Ho, Shih Szu, Lily Li, and Kara Hui Ying-Hung. Cheng Pei-pei in particular is relatively well-known for her starring role in King Hu&#x27;s &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot; and more recently in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; as Jade Fox.

===Influences===
The films produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio were highly popular among Chinese communities in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia and they would have a significant influence on later filmmakers, particularly in the kung fu genre. These films also reached the West and were popular for a time in the 1970s and early 1980s, having some influence on filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, who paid homage to the studio by displaying their logo in his &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; films and adapting the styles of some of their films.

The 2023 animated movie &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot; also paid homage to the studio by adding clips from classic Shaw Brothers movies into the movie when the title characters were trained in martial arts by their father figure, Master Splinter (voiced by Jackie Chan, who played smaller roles in few Shaw Brothers films), by showing them various video clips containing martial arts techniques, including clips from &quot;The 36th Chamber of Shaolin&quot;, &quot;Dirty Ho&quot;, &quot;The Magnificent Ruffians&quot; and &quot;Mad Monkey Kung Fu&quot;.

==Celestial Pictures acquisition and distribution==
Many Shaw Brothers classic films have been bootlegged due to the popularity of particular kung fu/martial arts titles. Celestial Pictures acquired rights to the Shaw Studio&#x27;s legacy and is releasing, on DVD, 760 out of the nearly 1,000 films with restored picture and sound quality. Many of these DVDs have come under controversy, however, for remixing audio and not including the original mono soundtracks.

===Karmaloop TV&#x27;s licensing deal===
Karmaloop TV, a multi-platform programming network designed to help operators &quot;reclaim&quot; viewership among the 18- to 34-year-old demographic, announced its first film licensing deal with Celestial Pictures. The Hong Kong–based company owns, restores and licenses the world&#x27;s largest collection of Chinese-made films including the Shaw Brothers library of fan-favourite kung fu and action classics such as &quot;The 36th Chamber of Shaolin&quot;, &quot;Five Deadly Venoms&quot;, and &quot;The One-Armed Swordsman&quot;.

The licensing deal with Karmaloop TV means that kung fu and action fans in the United States will see these films in their digitally restored versions, many of which will be premiering for the first time on U.S. television in high definition. The licensed collection includes more than 60 of the greatest martial arts masterpieces—movies which launched the careers of stars like Jimmy Wang Yu, Cheng Pei-Pei, Ti Lung, David Chiang, Alexander Fu Sheng, Chen Kuan-Tai, and Gordon Liu.

==Shaw Studios==

The Clearwater Bay site at Clearwater Bay Road and Ngan Ying Road is the former home of Shaw Studio (built 1960 to 1961), as well as the vacated TVB headquarters and studios (1986–2003, since relocated to TVB City) and Celestial Pictures. There are also apartment blocks used to house Shaw actors. The newer Shaw House and Shaw Villa are there. The site has been vacant since 2003 and has been targeted for redevelopment several times since 2006. In 2015, Hong Kong&#x27;s Antiquities Advisory Board declared the entire studio complex a site of cultural significance and subsequent redevelopment plans have included measures to restore and preserve the existing structures.

A new Shaw Studios (note the plural &quot;s&quot;) was built at Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate and opened in stages between 2006 and 2008.

<text>Stormwater, also written storm water, is water that originates from precipitation (storm), including heavy rain and meltwater from hail and snow. Stormwater can soak into the soil (infiltrate) and become groundwater, be stored on depressed land surface in ponds and puddles, evaporate back into the atmosphere, or contribute to surface runoff. Most runoff is conveyed directly as surface water to nearby streams, rivers or other large water bodies (wetlands, lakes and oceans) without treatment.

In natural landscapes, such as forests, soil absorbs much of the stormwater. Plants also reduce stormwater by improving infiltration, intercepting precipitation as it falls, and by taking up water through their roots. In developed environments, such as cities, unmanaged stormwater can create two major issues: one related to the volume and timing of runoff (flooding) and the other related to potential contaminants the water is carrying (water pollution). In addition to the pollutants carried in stormwater runoff, urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right

Stormwater is also an important resource as human population and demand for water grow, particularly in arid and drought-prone climates. Stormwater harvesting techniques and purification could potentially make some urban environments self-sustaining in terms of water.

== Impacts of stormwater ==
=== Stormwater pollution ===
With less vegetation and more impervious surfaces (parking lots, roads, buildings, compacted soil), developed areas allow less rain to infiltrate into the ground, and more runoff is generated than in undeveloped conditions. Additionally, passages such as ditches and storm sewers quickly transport runoff away from commercial and residential areas into nearby water bodies. This greatly increases the volume of water in waterways and the discharge of those waterways, leading to erosion and flooding. Because the water is flushed out of the watershed during the storm event, little infiltrates the soil, replenishes groundwater, or supplies stream baseflow in dry weather.

A first flush is the initial runoff of a rainstorm. During this phase, polluted water entering storm drains in areas with high proportions of impervious surfaces is typically more concentrated compared to the remainder of the storm. Consequently, these high concentrations of urban runoff result in high levels of pollutants discharged from storm sewers to surface waters.

Daily human activities result in deposition of pollutants on roads, lawns, roofs, farm fields, and other land surfaces. Such pollutants include trash, sediment, nutrients, bacteria, pesticides, metals, and petroleum byproducts. When it rains or there is irrigation, water runs off and ultimately makes its way to a river, lake, or the ocean. While there is some attenuation of these pollutants before entering receiving waters, polluted runoff results in large enough quantities of pollutants to impair receiving waters.

=== Stormwater runoff as a source of pollution ===

In addition to the pollutants carried in stormwater runoff, urban runoff is being recognized as a cause of pollution in its own right.
In natural catchments (watersheds) surface runoff entering waterways is a relatively rare event, occurring only a few times each year and generally after larger storms. Before development occurred, most rainfall soaked into the ground and contributed to groundwater recharge or was recycled into the atmosphere by vegetation through evapotranspiration.

Modern drainage systems, which collect runoff from impervious surfaces (e.g., roofs and roads), ensure that water is efficiently moved to waterways through pipe networks, meaning that even small storms result in increased waterway flows.

In addition to delivering higher pollutants from the urban catchment, increased stormwater flow can lead to stream erosion, encourage weed invasion, and alter natural flow regimes. Native species often rely on such flow regimes for spawning, juvenile development, and migration.
Stormwater runoff from roadways has been observed to contain many metals including zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), vanadium (V), cobalt (Co), and aluminum (Al) (Sansalone and Buchberger, 1997; Westerlund and Viklander, 2006) and other constituents.

In some areas, especially along the U.S. coast, polluted runoff from roads and highways may be the largest source of water pollution. For example, about 75 percent of the toxic chemicals getting to Seattle, Washington&#x27;s Puget Sound are carried by stormwater that runs off paved roads and driveways, rooftops, yards, and other developed land.Industrial stormwater is runoff from precipitation that lands on industrial sites (e.g. manufacturing facilities, mines, airports). This runoff is often polluted by materials that are handled or stored on the sites, and the facilities are subject to regulations to control the discharges.

== Stormwater Treatment ==
Stormwater Management Facilities (SWMF&#x27;s) are generally designed using Stokes&#x27; law to allow rudimentary treatment through the settling particulate matter larger than 40 micron in size and to impound water to reduce downstream flooding. However, regulation on the effluent from SWMF&#x27;s is becoming more stringent. Impact of the nutrient, Phosphorus either dissolved from (fertilizers) or bound to sediment particles from construction or agriculture runoff, causes algae and toxic cyanobacteria (aka Blue-green algae) blooms in receiving lakes. Cyanotoxin is of particular concern as many drinking water treatment plants can not effectively remove this health hazard. In a recent municipal stormwater treatment study, an advanced sedimentation technology was used passively in large diameter stormwater mains upstream of SWMF&#x27;s to remove an average of 90% of TSS and phosphorus during a near 50 year rain event turning a management facility into a passive treatment facility.

=== Passive treatment systems ===

Chemical treatment of stormwater to remove pollutants can be accomplished without large scale infrastructure improvements. Passive treatment technologies use the energy of water flowing by gravity through ditches, canals, culverts, pipes or other constructed conveyances to enable treatment. Self dosing products, such as Gel Flocculants, are placed in the flowing water where sediment particles, colloids and flow energy combine to release the required dosage, thereby creating heavy flocs which can then be easily filtered or settled. Natural woven fibers like jute are often used in ditch bottoms to act as filtration media. Silt retention mats can also be placed in situ to capture floccules. Sedimentation in a forebay is often utilized as a deposition area to clarify the water and concentrate the material. Mining, heavy construction and other industries have used passive systems for more than twenty years. These types of systems are low carbon as no external power source is needed, they require little skill to operate, minimal maintenance and are effective at reducing Total Suspended Solids, some heavy metals and the nutrient phosphorus.

=== Urban flooding ===
Stormwater is a major cause of urban flooding. Urban flooding is the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by stormwater overwhelming the capacity of drainage systems, such as storm sewers. Although triggered by single events such as flash flooding or snow melt, urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities. In areas susceptible to urban flooding, backwater valves and other infrastructure may be installed to mitigate losses.

Where properties are built with basements, urban flooding is the primary cause of basement and sewer backups. Although the number of casualties from urban flooding is usually limited, the economic, social and environmental consequences can be considerable: in addition to direct damage to property and infrastructure (highways, utilities and services), chronically wet houses are linked to an increase in respiratory problems and other illnesses. Sewer backups are often from the sanitary sewer system, which takes on some storm water as a result of Infiltration/Inflow.
=== Stormwater creation of sinkhole collapses ===
An example of urban stormwater creating a sinkhole collapse is the February 25, 2002 Dishman Lane collapse in Bowling Green, Kentucky where a sinkhole suddenly dropped the road under four traveling vehicles. The nine-month repair of the Dishman Lane collapse cost a million dollars but there remains the potential for future problems.

In undisturbed areas with natural subsurface (karst) drainage, soil and rock fragments choke karst openings thereby being a self-limitation to the growth of openings. The undisturbed karst drainage system becomes balanced with the climate so it can drain the water produced by most storms. However, problems occur when the landscape is altered by urban development. In urban areas with natural subsurface (karst) drainage there are no surface streams for the increased stormwater from impervious surfaces such as roofs, parking lots, and streets to runoff into. Instead, the stormwater enters the subsurface drainage system by moving down through the ground. When the subsurface water flow becomes great enough to transport soil and rock fragments, the karst openings grow rapidly. Where karst openings are roofed by supportive (competent) limestone, there frequently is no surface warning that an opening has grown so large it will suddenly collapse catastrophically. Therefore, land use planning for new development needs to avoid karst areas. Ultimately taxpayers end up paying the costs for poor land use decisions.

==Stormwater management==
Managing the quantity and quality of stormwater is termed, &quot;Stormwater Management.&quot; The term &quot;Best Management Practice&quot; (BMP) or stormwater control measure (SCM) is often used to refer to both structural or engineered control devices and systems (e.g. retention ponds) to treat or store polluted stormwater, as well as operational or procedural practices (e.g. street sweeping). Stormwater management includes both technical and institutional aspects.

=== Technical aspects ===

* control of flooding and erosion;
* control of hazardous materials to prevent release of pollutants into the environment (source control);
* planning and construction of stormwater systems like retention basins, buried vaults with various kinds of media filters, and vortex separators to remove coarse solids before they pollute surface waters or groundwater resources;
* acquisition and protection of natural waterways or rehabilitation;
* building nature-based solutions such as ponds, swales, constructed wetlands or green infrastructure solutions to work with existing or &quot;hard&quot; drainage structures, such as pipes and concrete channels (constructed wetlands built for stormwater treatment can also serve as habitat for plants, amphibians and fish)

=== Institutional and policy aspects ===

* development of funding approaches to stormwater programs potentially including stormwater user fees and the creation of a stormwater utility;
* development of long-term asset management programs to repair and replace aging infrastructure;
* revision of current stormwater regulations to address comprehensive stormwater needs;
* enhancement and enforcement of existing ordinances to make sure property owners consider the effects of stormwater before, during and after development of their land;
* education of a community about how its actions affect water quality, and about what it can do to improve water quality.

==Integrated water management==

Integrated water management (IWM) of stormwater has the potential to address many of the issues affecting the health of waterways and water supply challenges facing the modern urban city. IWM is often associated with green infrastructure when considered in the design process. Professionals in their respective fields, such as urban planners, architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers, often consider integrated water management as a foundation of the design process.

Also known as low impact development (LID) in the United States, or Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia, IWM has the potential to improve runoff quality, reduce the risk and impact of flooding and deliver an additional water resource to augment potable supply.

The development of the modern city often results in increased demands for water supply due to population growth, while at the same time altered runoff predicted by climate change has the potential to increase the volume of stormwater that can contribute to drainage and flooding problems. IWM offers several techniques, including stormwater harvest (to reduce the amount of water that can cause flooding), infiltration (to restore the natural recharge of groundwater), biofiltration or bioretention (e.g., rain gardens), to store and treat runoff and release it at a controlled rate to reduce impact on streams and wetland treatments (to store and control runoff rates and provide habitat in urban areas).

There are many ways of achieving LID. The most popular is to incorporate land-based solutions to reduce stormwater runoff through the use of retention ponds, bioswales, infiltration trenches, sustainable pavements (such as permeable paving), and others noted above. LID can also be achieved by utilizing engineered, manufactured products to achieve similar, or potentially better, results as land-based systems (underground storage tanks, stormwater treatment systems, biofilters, etc.). The proper LID solution is one that balances the desired results (controlling runoff and pollution) with the associated costs (loss of usable land for land-based systems versus capital cost of manufactured solution). Green (vegetated) roofs are also another low-cost solution.

IWM as a movement can be regarded as being in its infancy and brings together elements of drainage science, ecology and a realization that traditional drainage solutions transfer problems further downstream to the detriment of the environment and water resources.

==Regulations==

=== United States ===
====Federal requirements====

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with regulating stormwater pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA). The goal of the CWA is to restore all &quot;Waters of the United States&quot; to their &quot;fishable&quot; and &quot;swimmable&quot; conditions. Point source discharges, which originate mostly from municipal wastewater (sewage) and industrial wastewater discharges, have been regulated since enactment of the CWA in 1972. Pollutant loadings from these sources are tightly controlled through the issuance of National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. However, despite these controls, thousands of water bodies in the U.S. remain classified as &quot;impaired,&quot; meaning that they contain pollutants at levels higher than is considered safe by EPA for the intended beneficial uses of the water. Much of this impairment is due to polluted runoff, generally in urbanized watersheds (in other US watersheds, agricultural pollution is a major source).

To address the nationwide problem of stormwater pollution, Congress broadened the CWA definition of &quot;point source&quot; in 1987 to include industrial stormwater discharges and Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (&quot;MS4&quot;). These facilities are required to obtain NPDES permits. In 2017, about 855 large municipal systems (serving populations of 100,000 or more), and 6,695 small systems are regulated by the permit system.

====State and local requirements====

EPA has authorized 47 states to issue NPDES permits. In addition to implementing the NPDES requirements, many states and local governments have enacted their own stormwater management laws and ordinances, and some have published stormwater treatment design manuals. Some of these state and local requirements have expanded coverage beyond the federal requirements. For example, the State of Maryland requires erosion and sediment controls on construction sites of 5,000 sq ft (460 m2) or more. It is not uncommon for state agencies to revise their requirements and impose them upon counties and cities; daily fines ranging as high as $25,000 can be imposed for failure to modify their local stormwater permitting for construction sites, for instance.

====Nonpoint source pollution management====

Agricultural runoff (except for concentrated animal feeding operations, or &quot;CAFO&quot;) is classified as nonpoint source pollution under the CWA. It is not included in the CWA definition of &quot;point source&quot; and therefore not subject to NPDES permit requirements. The 1987 CWA amendments established a non-regulatory program at EPA for nonpoint source pollution management consisting of research and demonstration projects. Related programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program are conducted by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
==Public education campaigns==
Education is a key component of stormwater management. A number of agencies and organizations have launched campaigns to teach the public about stormwater pollution, and how they can contribute to solving it. Thousands of local governments in the U.S. have developed education programs as required by their NPDES stormwater permits.

One example of a local educational program is that of the West Michigan Environmental Action Council (WMEAC), which has coined the term &quot;Hydrofilth&quot; to describe stormwater pollution, as part of its &quot;15 to the River&quot; campaign. (During a rain storm, it may take only 15 minutes for contaminated runoff in Grand Rapids, Michigan to reach the Grand River.) Its outreach activities include a rain barrel distribution program and materials for homeowners on installing rain gardens.

Other public education campaigns highlight the importance of green infrastructure in slowing down and treating stormwater runoff. DuPage County Stormwater Management launched the &quot;Love Blue. Live Green.&quot; outreach campaign on social media sites to educate the public on green infrastructure and some other best management practices for stormwater runoff. Articles, websites, pictures, videos and other media are spread to the public through this campaign.

==History==
Stormwater infrastructure is an expensive long-term investment that is difficult to replace when the underlying circumstances change. As a result, the system will perform worse or malfunction more frequently over time. This is precisely what is occurring in the region surrounding Europe and the Baltic Sea, where the quickening pace of climate change is stressing the systems, the advancement of urbanization, and stricter regulations. Rethinking stormwater management techniques and investing in infrastructure are essential to adapting to these rapidly changing circumstances.

Stormwater runoff has been an issue since humans began living in concentrated villages or urban settings. During the Bronze Age, housing took a more concentrated form, and impervious surfaces emerged as a factor in the design of early human settlements. Some of the early incorporation of stormwater engineering is evidenced in Ancient Greece.

A specific example of an early stormwater runoff system design is found in the archaeological recovery at Minoan Phaistos on Crete.

<text>In mathematical analysis, the Minkowski inequality establishes that the L&quot;p&quot; spaces are normed vector spaces. Let formula_1 be a measure space, let formula_2 and let formula_3 and formula_4 be elements of formula_5 Then formula_6 is in formula_7 and we have the triangle inequality

formula_8

with equality for formula_9 if and only if formula_3 and formula_4 are positively linearly dependent; that is, formula_12 for some formula_13 or formula_14 Here, the norm is given by:

formula_15

if formula_16 or in the case formula_17 by the essential supremum

formula_18

The Minkowski inequality is the triangle inequality in formula_5 In fact, it is a special case of the more general fact

formula_20

where it is easy to see that the right-hand side satisfies the triangular inequality.

Like Hölder&#x27;s inequality, the Minkowski inequality can be specialized to sequences and vectors by using the counting measure:

formula_21

for all real (or complex) numbers formula_22 and where formula_23 is the cardinality of formula_1 (the number of elements in formula_1).

In probabilistic terms, given the probability space formula_26 and formula_27 denote the expectation operator for every real- or complex-valued random variables formula_28 and formula_29 on formula_30 Minkowski&#x27;s inequality reads

:formula_31
The inequality is named after the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski.

==Proof==

===Proof by Hölder&#x27;s inequality===
First, we prove that formula_6 has finite formula_33-norm if formula_3 and formula_4 both do, which follows by

formula_36

Indeed, here we use the fact that formula_37 is convex over formula_38 (for formula_39) and so, by the definition of convexity,

formula_40

This means that

formula_41

Now, we can legitimately talk about formula_42 If it is zero, then Minkowski&#x27;s inequality holds. We now assume that formula_43 is not zero. Using the triangle inequality and then Hölder&#x27;s inequality, we find that

formula_44

We obtain Minkowski&#x27;s inequality by multiplying both sides by

formula_45

===Proof by a direct convexity argument===

Given formula_46, one has, by convexity, 
:formula_47
By integration this leads to 
:formula_48
One takes then 
:formula_49
to reach the conclusion.

==Minkowski&#x27;s integral inequality==

Suppose that formula_50 and formula_51 are two -finite measure spaces and formula_52 is measurable. Then Minkowski&#x27;s integral inequality is:

formula_53

with obvious modifications in the case formula_54 If formula_55 and both sides are finite, then equality holds only if formula_56 a.e. for some non-negative measurable functions formula_57 and formula_58

If formula_59 is the counting measure on a two-point set formula_60 then Minkowski&#x27;s integral inequality gives the usual Minkowski inequality as a special case: for putting formula_61 for formula_62 the integral inequality gives

formula_63

If the measurable function formula_52 is non-negative then for all formula_65

formula_66

This notation has been generalized to

formula_67

for formula_68 with formula_69 Using this notation, manipulation of the exponents reveals that, if formula_70 then formula_71

==Reverse inequality==

When formula_72 the reverse inequality holds:
formula_73

We further need the restriction that both formula_3 and formula_4 are non-negative, as we can see from the example formula_76 and formula_77 formula_78

The reverse inequality follows from the same argument as the standard Minkowski, but uses that Holder&#x27;s inequality is also reversed in this range.

Using the Reverse Minkowski, we may prove that power means with formula_79 such as the harmonic mean and the geometric mean are concave.

==Generalizations to other functions==

The Minkowski inequality can be generalized to other functions formula_80 beyond the power function
formula_81 The generalized inequality has the form

formula_82

Various sufficient conditions on formula_83 have been found by Mulholland and others. For example, for formula_84 one set of sufficient conditions from Mulholland is 
# formula_80 is continuous and strictly increasing with formula_86
# formula_80 is a convex function of formula_88
# formula_89 is a convex function of formula_90

<text>Johnny Otis (born Ioannis Alexandres Veliotes (Greek: Ιωάννης Αλέξανδρος Βελιώτης)); December 28, 1921 – January 17, 2012) was a Greek American singer, musician, composer, bandleader, record producer, and talent scout. He was a seminal influence on American R&amp;B and rock and roll. He discovered numerous artists early in their careers who went on to become highly successful in their own right, including Little Esther Phillips, Etta James, Alan O&#x27;Day, Big Mama Thornton, Johnny Ace, Jackie Wilson, Little Willie John, Hank Ballard, and The Robins, Sugar Pie Desanto, among many others. Otis has been called the &quot;Godfather of Rhythm and Blues&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Otis was born in Vallejo, California, to Greek immigrant parents, Alexander J. Veliotes, a Mare Island longshoreman and grocery store owner, and his wife, the former Irene Kiskakes, a painter. He had a younger sister, Dorothy, and a younger brother, Nicholas A. Veliotes, who became the U.S. Ambassador to Jordan (1978–1981) and Egypt (1984–1986). Johnny grew up in a predominantly black neighborhood in Berkeley, California, where his father owned a grocery store. He became known for his choice to live his professional and personal life as a member of the African-American community. He wrote, &quot;As a kid I decided that if our society dictated that one had to be black or white, I would be black.&quot;

On May 2, 1941, when Otis was 19, he married Phyllis Walker, an 18-year-old woman of African American and Filipino descent from Oakland, whom he had known since childhood. Despite deep and enduring objections from his mother, the young couple left California and eloped to marry in Reno, Nevada, where interracial marriage was accepted at the time. They had four children: two sons, Shuggie Otis and Nicholas Otis—both of whom became musicians—and two daughters, Janice and Laura. Johnny and Phyllis also raised Lucky Otis, Shuggie&#x27;s son with his first wife, Miss Mercy Fontenot of The GTOs.

== Music career ==
Otis began playing drums as a teenager, having bought a set by forging his father&#x27;s signature on a credit slip. Soon after, he dropped out of Berkeley High School, in his junior year. He joined a local band, the West Oakland House Rockers, with his pianist friend &quot;Count&quot; Otis Matthews. By 1939, they were performing at many local functions, mostly in and around Oakland and Berkeley, and were popular among their peers.

In the early 1940s Otis played in swing orchestras, including Lloyd Hunter&#x27;s Serenaders and Harlan Leonard&#x27;s Rockets. He founded his own band in 1945; they had one of the most enduring hits of the big-band era, &quot;Harlem Nocturne&quot;, a composition by Earle Hagen. His band included Wynonie Harris, Charles Brown, and Illinois Jacquet, among others. In 1947, he and Bardu Ali opened the Barrelhouse Club in the Watts district of Los Angeles. Otis reduced the size of his band and hired the singers Mel Walker, Little Esther (born Esther Mae Jones and later known as Esther Phillips) and the Robins (who later became the Coasters). He discovered the teenaged Esther Jones when she won a talent show at the Barrelhouse Club. With this band, he toured extensively in the United States as the California Rhythm and Blues Caravan, and had a string of rhythm-and-blues hits through 1950.

Otis and his Orchestra played at the third annual Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on September 7, 1947. Woody Herman, The Valdez Orchestra, The Blenders, T-Bone Walker, Slim Gaillard, The Honeydrippers, Sarah Vaughn and the Three Blazers also performed that same day.

Otis discovered the tenor saxophonist Big Jay McNeely, who played on his up-tempo &quot;Barrelhouse Stomp&quot;. He began recording Little Esther and Mel Walker for Savoy Records, based in Newark, New Jersey, in 1949, and also released a stream of hit records, including &quot;Double Crossing Blues&quot;, &quot;Mistrustin&#x27; Blues&quot; and &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, all of which reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. In 1950, &quot;Billboard&quot; selected Otis as the R&amp;B Artist of the Year. He also began playing the vibraphone on many of his recordings.

In 1951, Otis released &quot;Mambo Boogie&quot;, featuring congas, maracas, claves, and mambo saxophone guajeos in a blues progression, the first R&amp;B mambo ever recorded. Otis moved to Mercury Records in 1951. He discovered the singer Etta James, who was then 13 years old, at one of his talent shows. He produced and co-wrote her first hit, &quot;The Wallflower (Dance with Me, Henry)&quot;.

In 1952, while in Houston, Texas, Otis auditioned the singer Willie Mae &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thornton. He produced, co-wrote, and played drums on her 1953 recording of &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (the first recording of the song); he and his band also provided the backup &quot;howling&quot; vocals. The song was co-written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Otis had a legal dispute with the songwriting duo over the credits after he learned that Leiber and Stoller had revised the contractual agreement before the singer Elvis Presley recorded a new version of the song, which quickly became a number 1 hit. Claiming Leiber and Stoller illegally had the original contract nullified and rewrote a new one stating that the two boys (who were both 17) were the only composers of the song, Otis sued. The judge decided the case in favor of the defendants, ruling that the first contract with Otis was null and void because they were minors when they signed it.

One of Otis&#x27;s most famous compositions is the ballad &quot;Every Beat of My Heart&quot;, first recorded by the Royals in 1952 for Federal Records. It was a hit for Gladys Knight and the Pips in 1961. Otis also produced and played the vibraphone on &quot;Pledging My Love&quot;, by the singer Johnny Ace, which was number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for 10 weeks. Another successful song for Otis was &quot;So Fine&quot;, originally recorded by the Sheiks in 1955 for Federal and a hit for the Fiestas in 1959. As an artist and repertory man for King Records, Otis discovered numerous young prospects who later became successful, including Jackie Wilson, Hank Ballard, and Little Willie John.

Otis hosted a television show, &quot;The Johnny Otis Show&quot;, and became an influential disc jockey in Los Angeles, with a program on radio station KFOX in Long Beach in 1955.

In 1955, Otis started his own label, Ultra Records (he changed the name to Dig after releasing five singles). He continued to perform and appeared on TV shows in Los Angeles from 1957. On the strength of their success, he signed with Capitol Records. Featuring the singer Marie Adams and with his band, now known as the Johnny Otis Show, he made a comeback, at first in the British charts with &quot;Ma! He&#x27;s Making Eyes at Me&quot; in 1957. In April 1958, he recorded his best-known song, &quot;Willie and the Hand Jive&quot;, a clave-based vamp. It was a hit in the summer of 1958, peaking at number 9 on the U.S. Pop chart, and was Otis&#x27;s only Top 10 single. The single reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. Otis&#x27;s success with the song was somewhat short-lived, and he briefly moved to King Records in 1961, where he worked with Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson.

In 1959, Otis auditioned the Coachella Valley, California band the Renes which featured a young Alan O&#x27;Day on vocals. Impressed, Otis recorded and produced the band performing three O&#x27;Day originals and a few covers at El Dorado Studios in Los Angeles. but the recordings were never released as most of the members of the Renes were minors.

In 1969, Otis landed a deal with Columbia Records and recorded the albums &quot;Cold Shot!&quot; and the sexually explicit &quot;Snatch and the Poontangs&quot;, both of which featured his son Shuggie and the singer Delmar &quot;Mighty Mouth&quot; Evans. A year later, he recorded a double live album of his band&#x27;s performance at the Monterey Jazz Festival, &quot;Johnny Otis Show Live at Monterey!&quot; with Little Esther Phillips, Eddie &quot;Cleanhead&quot; Vinson, Pee Wee Crayton, Ivory Joe Hunter, and The Mighty Flea, among others. A portion of the performance was featured in the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;.

&quot;Live at Monterey&quot; was released in 1971 by Epic Records. Reviewing it in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said, &quot;In-concert compilations are often incoherent, but the blues-style hard jive beloved of performer-turned-majordomo Otis has such formal integrity that this r&amp;b spectacular moves smoothly for four sides. Some of the featured players are no more than Otis&#x27;s hired hands, including guitarist Shuggie O. But (in ascending order) Roy Milton, Big Joe Turner, Ivory Joe Hunter, Little (?) Esther Phillips, Roy Brown, and Cleanhead Vinson are a cast that beats anything Richard Nader&#x27;s ever put into the Garden.&quot;

Otis toured less in the 1970s. He started the Blues Spectrum label and released a series of thirteen albums, &quot;Rhythm and Blues Oldies&quot;, which featured the 1950s R&amp;B artists Louis Jordan, Charles Brown, Big Joe Turner, Pee Wee Crayton, Joe Liggins, Gatemouth Moore, Roy Milton, Amos Milburn, Eddie &quot;Cleanhead&quot; Vinson, and Richard Berry, with three of those albums by Otis himself.

In the 1980s, Otis had a weekly radio show, airing Mondays from 8 to 11 p.m. on the Los Angeles radio station KPFK, on which he played records and received as guests R&amp;B artists such as Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins. Otis also recorded with his sons, Shuggie (guitar) and Nicky (drums), releasing the albums &quot;The New Johnny Otis Show&quot; (Alligator, 1981), &quot;Johnny Otis! Johnny Otis!&quot; (Hawk Sound, 1984) and &quot;Otisology&quot; (Kent, 1986). In the summer of 1987, Otis hosted his own &quot;Red Beans &amp; Rice R&amp;B Music Festival&quot; in Los Angeles, which featured top-name acts and hosted a Southern-style red beans and rice cook-off. Otis released &quot;Spirit of the Black Territory Bands&quot; in 1992, for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award. He moved the festival to the city of San Dimas, where it ran annually in association with the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation for twenty years, until 2006.

Otis and his family moved from southern California to Sebastopol, California, a small apple-farming town in Sonoma County. He continued his weekly radio program from KPFK&#x27;s sister station KPFA in Berkeley, California, which aired every Saturday from 9am to noon. Otis performed across the United States and Europe well through the 1990s, headlining the San Francisco Blues Festival in 1990 and 2000. In 1993, he opened the Johnny Otis Market in Sebastopol, a grocery/deli/cabaret where Otis and his band (now joined by his grandsons Lucky on bass and Eric on rhythm guitar) played sold-out shows every weekend until it closed its doors in 1995. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Blues Hall of Fame in 1994. He was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.

== Other work ==
In the 1960s, Otis entered journalism and politics. He lost an election for a seat in the California State Assembly. He then became deputy chief of staff to state Assemblyman, later, Democratic Congressman, Mervyn M. Dymally.

Otis also founded and preached in the New Landmark Community Gospel Church, which held Sunday services in Santa Rosa, California. Landmark&#x27;s worship services centered on Otis&#x27;s preaching and the traditional-style performances of a vocal group and choir backed by his rhythm section and an organist. The church closed in mid-1998.

&quot;The Johnny Otis Show&quot;, relocated from KPFK to sister station KPFA in Berkeley, California, where it aired on Saturday mornings. After his market in Sebastopol opened in 1994, Otis broadcast from there, with his band playing live on the air, later broadcasting from the Powerhouse Brewing Co. After Otis&#x27; retirement in late 2004, his grandson Lucky hosted the show at KPFA for two years, until its final airing in late 2006, when Otis and his wife moved back to Los Angeles.

In 1980, Frank Zappa stated in a Trouser Press interview that he adopted his trademark mustache and soul patch because &quot;it looked good on bluesman Johnny Otis, so I grew it.&quot;

He taught Music 15-B: Jazz, Blues and Popular Music in American Culture, a 3-unit Peralta Community College District class.

== Death ==
Otis died of natural causes on January 17, 2012, in the Altadena area of Los Angeles. He died three days before Etta James, whom he had discovered in the early 1950s. He is interred with his wife at Mountain View Cemetery in Altadena, California, US.

<text>A green roof or living roof is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. Container gardens on roofs, where plants are maintained in pots, are not generally considered to be true green roofs, although this is debated. Rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat greywater. Vegetation, soil, drainage layer, roof barrier and irrigation system constitute the green roof.

Green roofs serve several purposes for a building, such as absorbing rainwater, providing insulation, creating a habitat for wildlife, and decreasing stress of the people around the roof by providing a more aesthetically pleasing landscape, and helping to lower urban air temperatures and mitigate the heat island effect. Green roofs are suitable for retrofit or redevelopment projects as well as new buildings and can be installed on small garages or larger industrial, commercial and municipal buildings. They effectively use the natural functions of plants to filter water and treat air in urban and suburban landscapes. There are two types of green roof: intensive roofs, which are thicker, with a minimum depth of , and can support a wider variety of plants but are heavier and require more maintenance, and extensive roofs, which are shallow, ranging in depth from , lighter than intensive green roofs, and require minimal maintenance.

The term &quot;green roof&quot; may also be used to indicate roofs that use some form of green technology, such as a cool roof, a roof with solar thermal collectors or photovoltaic panels. Green roofs are also referred to as &quot;eco-roofs&quot;, &quot;oikosteges&quot;, &quot;vegetated roofs&quot;, &quot;living roofs&quot;, &quot;greenroofs&quot; and &quot;VCPH (Horizontal Vegetated Complex Partitions)&quot;

==Environmental benefits==
=== Thermal reduction and energy conservation ===

Green roofs improve and reduce energy consumption. They can reduce heating by adding mass and thermal resistance value, and can reduce the heat island effect by increasing evapotranspiration. A 2005 study by Brad Bass of the University of Toronto showed that green roofs can also reduce heat loss and energy consumption in winter conditions. A modeling study found that adding green roofs to 50 percent of the available surfaces in downtown Toronto would cool the entire city by .

Through evaporative cooling, a green roof reduces cooling loads on a building by fifty to ninety percent, especially if it is glassed-in so as to act as a terrarium and passive solar heat reservoir.

A concentration of green roofs in an urban area can reduce the city&#x27;s average temperatures during the summer, combating the urban heat island effect. Traditional building materials soak up the sun&#x27;s radiation and re-emit it as heat, making cities at least hotter than surrounding areas. On Chicago&#x27;s City Hall, by contrast, which features a green roof, roof temperatures on a hot day are typically cooler than they are on traditionally roofed buildings nearby. Green roofs are becoming common in Chicago, as well as in Atlanta, Portland, and other United States cities, where their use is encouraged by regulations to combat the urban heat-island effect. Green roofs are a type of low impact development. In the case of Chicago, the city has passed codes offering incentives to builders who put green roofs on their buildings. The Chicago City Hall green roof is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of green roofs in the United States; it was planted as an experiment to determine the effects a green roof would have on the microclimate of the roof. Following this and other studies, it has now been estimated that if all the roofs in a major city were greened, urban temperatures could be reduced by as much as .

=== Water management ===

Green roofs can reduce stormwater runoff via water-wise gardening techniques. Green roofs play a significant role in retrofitting the Low Impact Development (LID) practices in urban areas. A study presented at the Green Roofs for Healthy Cities Conference in June 2004, cited by the EPA, found water runoff was reduced by over 75% during rainstorms. Water is stored by the roof&#x27;s substrate and then taken up by the plants, from which it is returned to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation.

Green roofs decrease the total amount of runoff and slow the rate of runoff from the roof. It has been found that they can retain up to 75% of rainwater, gradually releasing it back into the atmosphere via condensation and transpiration, while retaining pollutants in their soil. Many green roofs are installed to comply with local regulations and government fees, often regarding stormwater runoff management. In areas with combined sewer-stormwater systems, heavy storms can overload the wastewater system and cause it to flood, dumping raw sewage into the local waterways. Often, phosphorus and nitrogen are in this category of environmentally harmful substances even though they are stimulating to the growth of plant life and agriculture. When these substances are added to a system, it can create mass biological activity since they are considered limiting factors of plant growth and by adding more of them to a system, it allows for more plant growth.

=== Ecological benefits ===
Green roofs create natural habitat as part of an urban wilderness. Even in high-rise urban settings as tall as 19 stories, it has been found that green roofs can attract beneficial insects, birds, bees and butterflies. A recent list of the bee species recorded from green roofs (worldwide) highlights both the diversity of species, but also the (expected) bias towards small ground-nesting species (Hofmann and Renner, 2017). Rooftop greenery complements wild areas by providing stepping stones for songbirds, migratory birds and other wildlife facing shortages of natural habitat. Bats have also been reported to be more active over green roofs due to the foraging opportunities these roofs provide. Research at the Javits Center green roof in New York, NY, has shown a correlation between higher numbers of certain insects on the roof, particularly moths, with an increased amount of bat foraging activity.

Green roofs also serve as a green wall, filtering pollutants and carbon dioxide out of the air, helping to lower rates of diseases such as asthma. They can also filter pollutants and heavy metals out of rainwater.

=== Carbon sequestration ===
An additional environmental benefit of a green roof is the ability to sequester carbon. Carbon is the main component of plant matter and is naturally absorbed by plant tissue. The carbon is stored in the plant tissue and the soil substrate through plant litter and root exudates. A study on green roofs in Michigan and Maryland found the above ground biomass and below ground substrate stored on average between 168 g C m−2 and 107 g C m−2 . Variations occurred among the different species of plant used. Substrate carbon content averaged 913 g C m−2 and after the subtraction of the original carbon content the total sequestration was 378 g C m−2. The sequestration can be improved by changing plant species, increasing substrate depth, substrate composition, and management practices. In a study done in Michigan above ground sequestration ranged from 64 g C m−2 to 239 g C m−2 for S. acre and S album. Also, by increasing the substrate depth would allow for more area of carbon storage and diversify the types of plants with greater potential of carbon storage. The direct carbon sequestration techniques and methods can be measured and accounted for. Green roofs also indirectly reduce CO2 given off by power plants through their ability to insulate buildings. Buildings in the US account for 38% of the total carbon dioxide emissions. A model supported by the U.S. Department of Energy found a 2 percent reduction in electricity consumption and 9-11% reduction in natural gas when implementing green roofs.

=== Other ===
*Help to insulate a building for sound; the soil helps to block lower frequencies and the plants block higher frequencies
*If installed correctly many living roofs can contribute to LEED points
*Increase agricultural space
*Green roofs not only retain rainwater, but also moderate the temperature of the water and act as natural filters for any of the water that happens to run off.

==Costs and financial benefits==
A properly designed and installed extensive green-roof system can cost while an intensive green roof costs However, since most of the materials used to build the green roof can be salvaged, it is estimated that the cost of replacing a green roof is generally one third of the initial installation costs.

With the initial cost of installing a green roof in mind, there are many financial benefits that accompany green roofing.
*Green roofing can extend the lifespan of a roof by over 200% by covering the waterproofing membrane with growing medium and vegetation, this shields the membrane from ultra-violet radiation and physical damage. Further, Penn State University&#x27;s Green Roof Research Center expects the lifespan of a roof to increase by as much as three times after greening the roof.
*It is estimated that the installation of a green roof could increase the real estate value of an average house by about 7%.
*Reduction in energy use is an important property of green roofing. By improving the thermal performance of a roof, green roofing allows buildings to better retain their heat during the cooler winter months while reflecting and absorbing solar radiation during the hotter summer months, allowing buildings to remain cooler. A study conducted by Environment Canada found a 26% reduction in summer cooling needs and a 26% reduction in winter heat losses when a green roof is used. With respect to hotter summer weather, green roofing is able to reduce the solar heating of a building by reflecting 27% of solar radiation, absorbing 60% by the vegetation through photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and absorbing the remaining 13% into the growing medium. Such mitigation of solar radiation has been found to reduce building temperatures by up to and reduce energy needs for air-conditioning by 25% to 80%. This reduction in energy required to cool a building in the summer is accompanied by a reduction in energy required to heat a building in the winter, thus reducing the energy requirements of the building year-round which allows the building temperature to be controlled at a lower cost.
*Depending on the region in which a green roof is installed, incentives may be available in the form of stormwater tax reduction, grants, or rebates. The regions where these incentives will most likely be found are areas where failing storm water management infrastructure is in place, urban heat island effect has significantly increased the local air temperature, or areas where environmental contaminants in the storm water runoff is of great concern. An example of such an incentive is a one-year property tax credit is available in New York City, since 2009, for property owners who green at least 50% of their roof area.

==Disadvantages==
The main disadvantage of green roofs is that the initial cost of installing a green roof can be double that of a normal roof. Depending on what kind of green roof it is, the maintenance costs could be higher, but some types of green roof have little or no ongoing cost. Some kinds of green roofs also place higher demands on the waterproofing system of the structure, both because water is retained on the roof and due to the possibility of roots penetrating the waterproof membrane. Another disadvantage is that the wildlife they attract may include pest insects which could easily infiltrate a residential building through open windows.

The additional mass of the soil substrate and retained water places a large strain on the structural support of a building. This makes it unlikely for intensive green roofs to become widely implemented due to a lack of buildings that are able to support such a large amount of added weight as well as the added cost of reinforcing buildings to be able to support such weight. Some types of green roofs do have more demanding structural standards especially in seismic regions of the world. Some existing buildings cannot be retrofitted with certain kinds of green roofs because of the weight load of the substrate and vegetation exceeds permitted static loading. The weight of a green roof caused the collapse of a large sports hall roof in Hong Kong in 2016. In the wake of the disaster numerous other green roofs around the territory were removed.

Green roofs require significantly more maintenance and maintenance energy compared to a standard roof. Standard maintenance include removing debris, controlling weeds, deadhead trimming, checking moisture levels, and fertilizing. The maintenance energy use for green roofs has many variables including: climate, intensity of rainfall, type of building, type of vegetation, and external coatings. The most significant effect comes from scarce rainfall which will increase the maintenance energy due to the watering required. During a 10-year roof maintenance cycle a house with a green roof requires more retrofit embodied energy than a house with a white roof. The individual components of a green roof have implications during the manufacturing process have additional implications compared to a conventional roof. The embodied energy for green roof components are of green roof. This value is equivalent to 6448 g C m−2 which is significantly greater than 378 g C m−2. Criteria for waste management practices when green roofs reach their end-of-life remain uncodified.

Both sod roofs and LWA-based (Lightweight Aggregates) roofs have been found to have a negative impact on the quality of their resulting runoff.

==Types==
Green roofs can be categorized as intensive, semi-intensive, or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium and the amount of maintenance they need. Extensive green roofs traditionally support of vegetation while intensive roofs support of vegetation. Traditional roof gardens, which require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants or conventional lawns, are considered intensive because they are labour-intensive, requiring irrigation, feeding, and other maintenance. Intensive roofs are more park-like with easy access and may include anything from kitchen herbs to shrubs and small trees.

Extensive green roofs, by contrast, are designed to be virtually self-sustaining and should require only a minimum of maintenance, perhaps a once-yearly weeding or an application of slow-release fertiliser to boost growth. Extensive roofs are usually only accessed for maintenance. They can be established on a very thin layer of soil (most use specially formulated composts): even a thin layer of rockwool laid directly onto a watertight roof can support a planting of &quot;Sedum&quot; species and mosses. Some green roof designs incorporate both intensive and extensive elements. To protect the roof, a waterproofing membrane is often used, which is manufactured to remain watertight in extreme conditions including constant dampness, ponding water, high and low alkaline conditions and exposure to plant roots, fungi and bacterial organisms.

Advances in green roof technology have led to the development of new systems that do not fit into the traditional classification of green roof types. Comprehensive green roofs bring the most advantageous qualities of extensive and intensive green roofs together. Comprehensive green roofs support plant varieties typically seen in intensive green roofs at the depth and weight of an extensive green roof system.

Another important distinction is between pitched green roofs and flat green roofs. Pitched sod roofs, a traditional feature of many Scandinavian buildings, tend to be of a simpler design than flat green roofs. This is because the pitch of the roof reduces the risk of water penetrating through the roof structure, allowing the use of fewer waterproofing and drainage layers.

==History==

In ancient times green roofs consisted of cave-like structures or sod roofs covered with earth and plants commonly used for agriculture, dwelling, and ceremonial purposes. These early shelters provided protection from the elements, good insulation during the winter months, and a cool location in the summer. Unfortunately for modern conveniences, these were neither waterproof nor was there any system to keep out unwanted burrowing wildlife.
Modern green roofs, which are made of a system of manufactured layers deliberately placed over roofs to support growing medium and vegetation, are a relatively new phenomenon. However, green roofs or sod roofs in northern Scandinavia have been around for centuries. The modern trend started when green roofs were developed in Germany in the 1960s, and has since spread to many countries. Today, it is estimated that about 10% of all German roofs have been &quot;greened&quot;.

A number of European Countries have very active associations promoting green roofs, including Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Sweden, the UK, and Greece. Germany was the first country to start developing green roof systems and market them on a large scale. The City of Linz in Austria has been paying developers to install green roofs since 1983, and in Switzerland, it has been a federal law since the late 1990s. In the UK, their uptake has been slow, but a number of cities have developed policies to encourage their use, notably London and Sheffield.

Green roofs are also becoming increasingly popular in North America, although they are not as common as in some parts of Europe. Numerous North American cities offer tax incentives to developers who integrate green roofs in their buildings. Toronto and San Francisco legally mandate new buildings to include green roofs.

Rooftop water purification is also being implemented in green roofs. These forms of green roofs are actually treatment ponds built into the rooftops. They are built either from a simple substrate (as being done in Dongtan) or with plant-based ponds. Plants used include calamus, &quot;Menyanthes trifoliata&quot;, &quot;Mentha aquatica&quot;, etc.)

Several studies have been carried out in Germany since the 1970s. Berlin is one of the most important centers of green roof research in Germany. Particularly in the last 10 years, much more research has begun. About ten green roof research centers exist in the US and activities exist in about 40 countries. In a recent study on the impacts of green infrastructure, in particular green roofs in the Greater Manchester area, researchers found that adding green roofs can help keep temperatures down, particularly in urban areas: &quot;adding green roofs to all buildings can have a dramatic effect on maximum surface temperatures, keeping temperatures below the 1961–1990 current form case for all time periods and emissions scenarios. Roof greening makes the biggest difference…where the building proportion is high and the evaporative fraction is low. Thus, the largest difference was made in the town centers&quot;.

==Brown roofs==

Industrial brownfield sites can be valuable ecosystems, supporting rare species of plants, animals and invertebrates. Increasingly in demand for redevelopment, these habitats are under threat. &quot;Brown roofs&quot;, also known as &quot;biodiverse roofs&quot;, can partly mitigate this loss of habitat by covering the flat roofs of new developments with a layer of locally sourced material. Construction techniques for brown roofs are typically similar to those used to create flat green roofs, the main difference being the choice of growing medium (usually locally sourced rubble, gravel, soil, etc...) to meet a specific biodiversity objective. In Switzerland, it is common to use alluvial gravels from the foundations; in London, a mix of brick rubble and some concrete has been used.

The original idea was to allow the roofs to self-colonise with plants, but they are sometimes seeded to increase their biodiversity potential in the short term. Such practices are derided by purists. The roofs are colonised by spiders and insects (many of which are becoming extremely rare in the UK as such sites are developed) and provide a feeding site for insectivorous birds. Laban, a centre for contemporary dance in London, has a brown roof specifically designed to encourage the nationally rare black redstart. A green roof, above ground level, and claimed to be the highest in the UK and Europe &quot;and probably in the world&quot; to act as nature reserve, is on the Barclays Bank HQ in Canary Wharf. Designed combining the principles of green and brown roofs, it is already home to a range of rare invertebrates.

==Examples by country==
===Australia===
Green roofs have been increasing in popularity in Australia over the past 10 years. Some of the early examples include the Freshwater Place residential tower in Melbourne (2002) with its Level 10 rooftop Half Acre Garden, CH2 building housing the Melbourne City Council (2006) – Australia&#x27;s first 6-star Green Star Design commercial office building as certified by the Green Building Council of Australia, and Condor Tower (2005) with a lawn on the 4th floor.

Since 2008, city councils and influential business groups in Australia have become active promoting the benefits of green roofs. &quot;The Blueprint to Green Roof Melbourne&quot; is one program being run by the Committee for Melbourne. In 2010, the largest Australian green roof project was announced. The Victorian Desalination Project will have a &quot;living tapestry&quot; of 98,000 Australian indigenous plants over a roof area spanning more than . The roof will form part of the desalination plant&#x27;s sophisticated roof system, designed to blend the building into the landscape, and provide acoustic protection, corrosion resistance, thermal control, and reduced maintenance.
In June 2014 ecological artist Lloyd Godman, with structural engineer Stuart Jones and environmental scientist Grant Harris collaborated to install an experiment using Tillandsia plants in extreme outdoor conditions at levels 92, 91, 65 and 56 on Eureka Tower in Melbourne, Australia. The selected air plants are extremely light, and are able to grow with no soil or watering system, and the plants have been checked at regular intervals since their installation and are still growing and flowering. One species; Tillandsia bergeri, has grown from a single shoot to several thriving colonies.

The project is now titled Tillandsia SWARM and has been expanded to include many other buildings across Australia, including Federation Square, National Gallery of Victoria and Essendon Airport. Godman has also experimented with Tillandsia plant screens that can be moved across skylights to create shade in summer and to allow in sun during winter. Temperature readings taken on a 40 °C day in summer revealed that the surface temperature on the roof had reached 84 °C, while the shadows cast by the plants had reduced the surface temperature on the roof to 51 °C.

===Canada===

The city of Toronto approved a by-law in May 2009 mandating green roofs on residential and industrial buildings. There is criticism from Green Roofs for Healthy Cities that the new laws are not stringent enough, since they will only apply to residential building that are a minimum of six stories high. By 31 January 2011, industrial buildings were required to render 10% or of their roofs green. Toronto City Hall&#x27;s Podium roof was renovated to include a rooftop garden, the largest publicly accessible roof in the city. The green roof was opened to the public in June 2010. Many green roofs in Canada also use sustainable rainwater harvesting practices.

In 2008, the Vancouver Convention Centre installed a living roof of indigenous plants and grasses on its West building, making it the largest green roof in Canada.
The new Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, opened in 2005, also features a grass-covered roof.

During the renovation of the Hamilton City Hall in Hamilton, Ontario that spanned from 2007 to 2010, many efforts were taken to enhance the environmentally friendly nature of the structure, which included the addition of a grass-covered roof.

Simon Fraser University&#x27;s Burnaby campus contains a substantial number of green roofs.

Canada&#x27;s first LEED Platinum V4 Home in Wakefield QC, EcoHome&#x27;s Edelweiss House, has a living Green Roof which is sloped at 12 degrees.

===Costa Rica===
Living green roofs have been built and grown at Saint Michael&#x27;s Sustainable Community since 2012. Native plants, mostly flowers chosen for the environment, maximum shade and mass provide a colorful and functional living roof. The community has the largest number of green roofs in the country.

===Egypt===
In Egypt, soil-less agriculture is used to grow plants on the roofs of buildings. No soil is placed directly on the roof itself, thus eliminating the need for an insulating layer; instead, plants are grown on wooden tables. Vegetables and fruit are the most popular candidates, providing a fresh, healthy source of food that is free from pesticides.

A more advanced method, (aquaponics), being used experimentally in Egypt, is farming fish next to plants in a closed cycle. This allows the plants to benefit from the ammonia excreted by the fish, helping the plants to grow better and at the same time eliminating the need for changing the water for the fish, because the plants help to keep it clean by absorbing the ammonia. The fish also get some nutrients from the roots of the plants.

===Finland===
In Finland, green roofs are still scarce. Some experimental green roofs have been built in big cities. However, the capital city of Helsinki has published guidelines for enhancing the building of green roofs in the city. There is on-going research on the topic as the conditions in the southern Europe are very different from those in the north and knowledge acquired there can&#x27;t be directly applied to colder climates. The fifth dimension – Green roofs and walls in urban areas -research program aims to produce high-level scientific and broadly applicable knowledge on optimal green roof and -wall solutions in Finland.

===France===

In France, an extensive, cable-supported green roof has been created on the International School in Lyon. Another huge green roof of roughly has been incorporated into the new museum L&#x27;Historial de la Vendée which opened in June 2006 at Les Lucs-sur-Boulogne.

===Germany===
Long-held green roof traditions started in the early industrialization period more than 100 years ago exist in Germany. In the 1970s, green roof technology was elevated to the next level. Serious storm-water issues made cities think about innovative solutions, preferably with living plants. Modern green roof technology with high performance, lightweight materials were used to grow hardy vegetation even on roofs that can hardly support any additional load. In the 1980s modern green roof technology was common knowledge in Germany while it was practically unknown in any other country in the world. In Stuttgart, with one of the most innovative Department of Parks and Recreation and with the world&#x27;s oldest horticultural Universities, modern green roof technology was perfected and implemented on a large scale. By the early 2000s, Germany had laws mandating that many metropolitan areas have green roofs.

With the first green roof industry boom in Germany there were quality issues recorded. The FLL formed a committee that is focused on modern green roof technology. FLL stands for Forschungsgesellschaft Landschaftsentwicklung Landschaftsbau e.V. (German Landscape Research, Development and Construction Society). The FLL is an independent non-profit organization. It was founded in 1975 by eight professional organizations for &quot;the improvement of environmental conditions through the advancement and dissemination of plant research and its planned applications&quot;. The FLL green roof working group is only one of 40 committees which have published a long list of guidelines and labor instructions. Some of these guidelines also available in English including the German FLL-Guideline for the Planning, Execution and Upkeep of Green-Roof Sites. The results of the research and synthesis done by FLL members are constantly updated and promulgated utilizing the same principles which govern the compilation of DIN standards and are published as either guiding principles or labor instructions.

The current Green Roof Guideline was published in 2011.
Today most elements of the German FLL are part of standards and guidelines around the world (FM Global, ASTM, NRCA, SPRI etc.).

Fachvereinigung Bauwerksbegrünung (FBB) was founded in 1990 as the second green roof association after DDV (Deutscher Dachgaertner Verband) in 1985. FBB was founded as an open forum for manufacturers and planners, merchants and operators in 1990. The organization was born from the then-visionary idea of understanding the relationship between nature and constructions not as oppositional, but as an opportunity. Both the green roofing and conventional roofing industries are equally represented.
The FBB has developed to become an innovative lobbying group with a strong market presence, internationally known through its cooperation with other European associations. Today, approximately 100 member companies use the multifaceted services offered by FBB, which offers a greater degree of market expertise and competitiveness. &quot;Kompetenz im Markt&quot;.

Today, about of new green roofs are being constructed each year. According latest studies about of these are extensive; the last are roof gardens. The cities with the most green roofs in Germany are Berlin and Stuttgart. Surveys about the status of regulation are done by the FBB. Nearly one third of all German cities have regulations to support green-roof and rain-water technology. Green-roof research institutions are located in several cities as including Hannover, Berlin, Geisenheim and Neubrandenburg.

Germany is the country with the most green roofs in the world as well as the country with the most advanced knowledge in modern green roof technology. Green roofs in Germany are part of the 2 –3 years apprentice educations system of landscaping professionals.

===Greece===

The Greek Ministry of Finance has now installed a green roof on the Treasury in Constitution Square in Athens. The so-called &quot;oikostegi&quot; (Greek – &quot;oiko&quot;, , meaning building-ecological, and &quot;stegi&quot;, pronounced &quot;staygee&quot;, meaning roof-abode-shelter) was inaugurated in September 2008. Studies of the thermodynamics of the roof in September 2008 concluded that the thermal performance of the building was significantly affected by the installation. In further studies, in August 2009, energy savings of 50% were observed for air conditioning in the floor directly below the installation. The ten-floor building has a total floor space of . The oikostegi covers , equalling 52% of the roof space and 8% of the total floor space. Despite this, energy savings totalling €5,630 per annum were recorded, which translates to a 9% saving in air conditioning and a 4% saving in heating bills for the whole building. An additional observation and conclusion of the study was that the thermodynamic performance of the oikostegi had improved as biomass was added over the 12 months between the first and second study. This suggests that further improvements will be observed as the biomass increases still further. The study also stated that while measurements were being made by thermal cameras, a plethora of beneficial insects were observed on the roof, such as butterflies, honey bees and ladybirds. Obviously this was not the case before installation. Finally, the study suggested that both the micro-climate and biodiversity of Constitution Square, in Athens, Greece had been improved by the oikostegi.

===Iceland===

Sod roofs are frequently found on traditional farmhouses and farm buildings in Iceland.

=== Malaysia ===
Bus stops in Kuala Lumpur were fitted with green roofs in 2019.

=== Poland ===
Several cities in Poland have implemented policies and incentives to encourage the installation of green roofs, including Warsaw, Krakow, and Wroclaw. These policies have helped to increase the adoption of green roofs in the country, particularly in urban areas, where they are seen as an important tool for mitigating the environmental impacts of urbanization and improving the quality of life for city residents. The University of Warsaw green roof is one of the most impressive and well-known examples of green roofs in Poland. It covers an area of approximately 10,000 square meters and includes over 30,000 plants from more than 70 different species.

=== Singapore ===

Singapore installed a green roof on a bus in 2019 as part of an experiment led by researchers at the National University of Singapore. Green roofs on bus stops in Singapore were found to reduce ambient temperatures by up to 2C.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland has one of Europe&#x27;s oldest green roofs, created in 1914 at the Moos lake water-treatment plant, Wollishofen, Zürich. Its filter tanks have of flat concrete roofs. To keep the interior cool and prevent bacterial growth in the filtration beds, a drainage layer of gravel and a layer of soil was spread over the roofs, which had been waterproofed with asphalt. A meadow developed from seeds already present in the soil; it is now a haven for many plant species, some of which are now otherwise extinct in the district, most notably 6,000 &quot;Orchis morio&quot; (green-winged orchid). More recent Swiss examples can be found at Klinikum 1 and Klinikum 2, the Cantonal Hospitals of Basel, and the Sihlpost platform at Zürich&#x27;s main railway station.

===Sweden===
What is claimed to be the world&#x27;s first green roof botanical garden was set up in Augustenborg, Malmö in May 1999. The International Green Roof Institute (IGRI) opened to the public in April 2001 as a research station and educational facility. (It has since been renamed the Scandinavian Green Roof Institute (SGRI), in view of the increasing number of similar organisations around the world.) Green roofs are well-established in Malmö: the Augustenborg housing development near the SGRI botanical garden incorporates green roofs and extensive landscaping of streams, ponds, and soak-ways between the buildings to deal with storm water run-off.

The new Bo01 urban residential development (in the Västra Hamnen (Western Harbour) close to the foot of the Turning Torso office and apartment block, designed by Santiago Calatrava) is built on the site of old shipyards and industrial areas, and incorporates many green roofs.

In 2012, the shopping mall Emporia with its roof garden, was opened. The size of the roof garden is approximately equivalent to 4 soccer fields, which makes it one of the biggest green roof parks in Europe that is accessible to the public.

===United Kingdom===

In 2003 English Nature concluded that &#x27;in the UK policy makers have largely ignored green roofs&#x27;. However, British examples can be found with increasing frequency. The Kensington Roof Gardens are a notable early roof garden which was built above the former Derry &amp; Toms department store in Kensington, London in 1938. More recent examples can be found at the University of Nottingham Jubilee Campus, and in London at Sainsbury&#x27;s Millennium Store in Greenwich, the Horniman Museum and at Canary Wharf. The Ethelred Estate, close to the River Thames in central London, is the British capital&#x27;s largest roof-greening project to date. Toxteth in Liverpool is also a candidate for a major roof-greening project.

In the United Kingdom, intensive green roofs are sometimes used in built-up city areas where residents and workers often do not have access to gardens or local parks. Extensive green roofs are sometimes used to blend buildings into rural surroundings, for example by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, who has one of the biggest green roofs in Europe (covering more than on their factory at Goodwood, West Sussex.

The University of Sheffield has created a Green Roof Centre of Excellence and conducted research, particularly in a UK context, into green roofs. Nigel Dunnett of Sheffield University published a UK-centric book about green roofing in 2004 (updated 2008).

Fort Dunlop has the largest green roof in the UK since its redevelopment between 2004 and 2006.

The UK also has one of the most innovative food preparation facilities in Europe, the Kanes salad factory in Evesham. It is topped with a wildflower roof featuring nearly 90 species of wildflower and natural grasses. The seed mix was prepared in consultation with leading ecologists to try to minimise the impact on the local environment. The pre-grown wildflower blanket sits on top of a standing seam roof and is combined with solar panels to create an eco-friendly finish to the entire factory. The development also won the 2013 National Federation of Roofing Contractors Sustainable Roof Award for Green Roofing.

===United States===

One of the largest expanses of extensive green roof is to be found in the US, at Ford Motor Company&#x27;s River Rouge Plant, Dearborn, Michigan, where of assembly plant roofs are covered with sedum and other plants, designed by William McDonough; the $18 million assembly avoids the need of what otherwise would be $50 million worth of mechanical treatment facilities on site. Built over Millennium Park Garage, Chicago&#x27;s Millennium Park is considered one of the largest intensive green roofs. Other well-known American examples include Chicago&#x27;s City Hall and the former Gap headquarters, now the headquarters of YouTube, in San Bruno, CA. The U.S. military has two major green roofs in the Washington, D.C. area: the U.S. Coast Guard headquarters () and the Pentagon ().

An early green-roofed building (completed in 1971) is the Weyerhaeuser Corporate Headquarters building in Federal Way, Washington. Its 5-story office roof system comprises a series of stepped terraces covered in greenery. From the air, the building blends into the landscape.

The largest green roof in New York City was installed in midtown Manhattan atop the United States Postal Service&#x27;s Morgan Processing and Distribution Center. Construction on the project began in September 2008, and was finished and dedicated in July 2009. Covered in native vegetation and having an expected lifetime of fifty years, this green roof will not only save the USPS approximately $30,000 a year in heating and cooling costs, but will also significantly reduce the amount of storm water contaminants entering the municipal water system.

In 2001, atop Chicago City Hall, the roof gardens were completed, serving as a pilot project to assess the impact green roofs would have on the heat island effect in urban areas, rainwater runoff, and the effectiveness of differing types of green roofs and plant species for Chicago&#x27;s climate. Although the rooftop is not normally accessible to the public, it is visually accessible from 33 taller buildings in the area. The garden consists of 20,000 plants of more than 150 species, including shrubs, vines and two trees. The green roof design team was headed by the Chicago area firm Conservation Design Forum in conjunction with noted &quot;green&quot; architect William McDonough. With an abundance of flowering plants on the rooftop, beekeepers harvest approximately of honey each year from hives installed on the rooftop. Tours of the green roof are by special arrangement only. Chicago City Hall Green Roof won merit design award of the American Society of Landscape Architecture (ASLA) competition in 2002.

The of outdoor space on the seventh floor of Zeckendorf Towers, formerly an undistinguished rooftop filled with potted plants, make up the largest residential green roof in New York. The roof was transformed in 2010 as part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s NYC Green Infrastructure campaign, and supposedly serves to capture some of the rain that falls on it rather than letting it run off and contribute to flooding in the adjacent Union Square subway station.

Some cost can also be attributed to maintenance. Extensive green roofs have low maintenance requirements but they are generally not maintenance free. German research has quantified the need to remove unwanted seedlings to approximately 6 seconds/m2/year. Maintenance of green roofs often includes fertilization to increase flowering and succulent plant cover. If aesthetics are not an issue, fertilization and maintenance are generally not needed. Extensive green roofs should only be fertilized with controlled-release fertilizers in order to avoid pollution of the storm water. Conventional fertilizers should never be used on extensive vegetated roofs. German studies have approximated the nutrient requirement of vegetated roofs to 5 gN/m2. It is also important to use a substrate that does not contain too many available nutrients. The FLL guidelines specify maximum-allowable nutrient content of substrates.

One of the oldest American green roofs in existence is atop the Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, built in 1936. This roof was primarily an aesthetic undertaking for the enjoyment of the center&#x27;s workers, and remains to this day, having been refurbished in 1986.

With the passage of Denver&#x27;s Green Roof Initiative in the November 2017 elections, effective January 2018, new buildings or existing buildings meeting the initiative&#x27;s thresholds are required to have rooftop gardens, optionally combined with solar photovoltaic panels.

Seattle is another city in which green roofs have been used on an increasing basis. This phenomenon is in large part due to efforts on behalf of the city to encourage green roofs through new and improved building codes. In 2006, the Seattle Green Factor program was approved. The program rewards the incorporation of landscaping in new building developments in an attempt to reduce stormwater runoff and associated pollution, stabilize temperatures, and create habitats for birds and insects. These changes were expanded in 2009 to recognize the specific stormwater benefits of green roofs, and to reward developers who used them accordingly.

By 2010, Seattle was home to approximately of green roofs. Despite initial hiccups in the city stemming from weeds, lack of irrigation during dry summer months, and a need for continuous replanting, the project has continued to succeed as understanding around the best soils and plants and the need for monitoring and upkeep has increased. A 2010 survey of the green roofs in Seattle acknowledged that while the initial costs of implementing a green roof may deter businesses or homeowners, it is likely that green roofs actually preserve the roofing material and cut costs in the long run. In light of the success in Seattle, other cities such as Portland, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. have all made efforts to develop their own Green Factor programs.

The Seattle City Hall has led the way by implementing a green roof project that has involved the planting of more than 22,000 pots of sedum, fescue, and grass. The City hopes that the project can reduce the annual stormwater runoff for the building by 50 to 75 percent, which will in turn reduce damage to local watershed areas that provide habitats for native species such as salmon. The historic Union Stables building has used green roofs alongside other efficiency based changes to reduce stormwater runoff and decrease the building&#x27;s energy use by 70 percent. The Park Place building in Seattle&#x27;s downtown provides a leading example of the use of landscaping to recapture rain water with the hopes of cutting back spending on utilities.

Washington, D.C.

Washington, D.C., started implementing incentives for green roofs within their city at the beginning of the 21st century. In 2003, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation introduced a “green roof demonstration project” in combination with the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority. This program issued grants to several pilot green roofs, which would assist with the cost of construction for the building owner. From this project the city began to understand how beneficial these roofs could be and more programs were implemented over the years. In 2007, the Riversmart Rewards Program introduced a RiverSmart Rooftops Green Roof Rebate Program that would lend a $3 per square foot subsidy to potential green roof projects within the District. This culminated to assist 12 projects that year. A year later, the subsidy was raised to $5, incentivizing even more developers to use this program within their design. There is also possibility through the RiverSmart Rewards program for “residents and property owners to receive a significant discount on their water utility fees” if they install approved stormwater management features. In 2016, a rebate of $10-$15 per square feet was introduced, “promoting the voluntary installation of green roofs for the purpose of reducing stormwater runoff and pollutants”. $10 per square foot rebates were set for installation within a combined sewer system. $15 per square foot rebates were set for installation within a municipal storm sewer system. The greatest aspect of this incentivized project is the lack of restriction of building type that qualifies. There is no size cap on properties that qualify whether it’s residential, commercial or institutional. In 2016 there was a total of 2.3 million square feet of green roofing within the district. As of 2020, there is 5.1 million square feet of green roofing.

<doc id="192030" wikidata="Q322871" url="?curid=192030" title="Arthur Quiller-Couch">
<text>Sir Arthur Thomas Quiller-Couch (; 21 November 186312 May 1944) was a British writer who published using the pseudonym Q. Although a prolific novelist, he is remembered mainly for the monumental publication &quot;The Oxford Book of English Verse 1250–1900&quot; (later extended to 1918) and for his literary criticism. He influenced many who never met him, including American writer Helene Hanff, author of &quot;84, Charing Cross Road&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Q&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. His &quot;The Oxford Book of English Verse&quot; was a favourite of John Mortimer fictional character Horace Rumpole.

==Life==
Arthur Quiller-Couch was born in the town of Bodmin, Cornwall. He was the son of DrThomas Quiller Couch (d.1884), who was a noted physician, folklorist and historian who married Mary Ford and lived at 63, Fore Street, Bodmin, until his death in 1884. Thomas was the product of the union of two ancient local families, the Quiller family and the Couch family. Arthur was the third in a line of intellectuals from the Couch family. His grandfather, Jonathan Couch, was a naturalist, physician, historian, classicist, apothecary, and illustrator (particularly of fish). His younger sisters Florence Mabel and Lilian M. were also writers and folklorists.

Arthur Quiller-Couch had two children. His son, Bevil Brian Quiller-Couch, was a war hero and poet, whose romantic letters to his fiancée, the poet May Wedderburn Cannan, were published in &quot;Tears of War&quot;. Kenneth Grahame inscribed a first edition of his &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; to Arthur&#x27;s daughter, Foy Felicia, attributing Quiller-Couch as the inspiration for the character Ratty.

Quiller-Couch was educated at Newton Abbot Proprietary College between the late 1870&#x27;s and early 1880&#x27;s. Thereafter, he also attended Clifton College, and Trinity College, Oxford, where he took a First in Classical Moderations (1884) and a Second in Greats (1886). From 1886, Quiller-Couch worked for a brief time as a Classics lecturer at Trinity. Thereafter, having gained some journalistic experience in London, mainly as a contributor to &quot;The Speaker&quot;, he resettled at Fowey in Cornwall during 1891.

In Cornwall he was an active political worker for the Liberal Party. He was knighted in 1910, and in 1928 was made a Bard of the Cornish cultural society Gorseth Kernow, adopting the Bardic name &quot;Marghak Cough&quot; (&#x27;Red Knight&#x27;). He was Commodore of the Royal Fowey Yacht Club from 1911 until his death. He was president of the Village Drama Society which was based at Kelly House in Devon. 

Quiller-Couch died at home in May 1944 aged 80, after being slightly injured by a jeep near his home in Cornwall in the preceding March during his daily walk to the Royal Fowey Yacht Club.

==World War I==

The Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry 10th Btn. (Cornwall Pioneers) was an unusual battalion, having been raised in March 1915, not by the War Office, but by the Mayor and citizens of Truro. It initially had only two officers – Colonel Dudley Acland Mills, who had retired from the Royal Engineers six years earlier, and Quiller-Couch, who was devoid of any military experience. Neither of them was paid. They raised and trained a battalion, which was taken over by the War Office on 24 August 1915.

==Literary and academic career==

In 1887, while he was attending Oxford, he published &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Rock&quot;, a romance in the style of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, and later &quot;The Astonishing History of Troy Town&quot; (1888), a comic novel set in a fictionalised version of his home town of Fowey, and &quot;The Splendid Spur&quot; (1889). Quiller-Couch was well known for his story &quot;The Rollcall of the Reef&quot;, based on the wreck of HMS &quot;Primrose&quot; during 1809 on the Cornish coast. He published during 1896 a series of critical articles, &quot;Adventures in Criticism&quot;, and in 1898 he published a completion of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s unfinished novel, &quot;St. Ives&quot;.

From his Oxford time he was known as a writer of excellent verse. With the exception of the parodies entitled &quot;Green Bays&quot; (1893), his poetical work is contained in &quot;Poems and Ballads&quot; (1896). In 1895 he published an anthology from the 16th- and 17th-century English lyricists, &quot;The Golden Pomp&quot;, followed in 1900 by the &quot;Oxford Book of English Verse, 1250–1900&quot;. Later editions of this extended the period of concern to 1918 and it remained the leading general anthology of English verse until Helen Gardner&#x27;s &quot;New Oxford Book of English Verse&quot; appeared in 1972.

In 1910 he published &quot;The Sleeping Beauty and other Fairy Tales from the Old French&quot;. He was the author of a number of popular novels with Cornish settings (collected edition as &#x27;Tales and Romances&#x27;, 30 vols. 1928–29).

He was appointed King Edward VII Professor of English Literature at the University of Cambridge in 1912, and retained the chair for the rest of his life. Simultaneously he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College, which he also held until his death. His inaugural lectures as the professor of English literature were published as the book &quot;On the Art of Writing&quot;. His rooms were on staircase C, First Court, and known as the &#x27;Q-bicle&#x27;. He supervised the beginnings of the English Faculty there — an academic diplomat in a fractious community. He is sometimes regarded as the epitome of the school of English literary criticism later modified by his pupil F. R. Leavis.

Alistair Cooke was a notable student of Quiller-Couch and Nick Clarke&#x27;s semi-official biography of Cooke features Quiller-Couch prominently, noting that he was regarded by the Cambridge establishment as &quot;rather eccentric&quot; even by the university&#x27;s standards.

Quiller-Couch was a noted literary critic, publishing editions of some of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays (in the &quot;New Shakespeare&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press, with Dover Wilson) and several critical works, including &quot;Studies in Literature&quot; (1918) and &quot;On the Art of Reading&quot; (1920). He edited a companion to his verse anthology: &quot;The Oxford Book of English Prose&quot;, which was published in 1923. He left his autobiography, &quot;Memories and Opinions&quot;, unfinished; it was nevertheless published in 1945.

==Legacy==

His &quot;Book of English Verse&quot; is often quoted by John Mortimer&#x27;s fictional character Horace Rumpole.

&quot;Castle Dor&quot;, a re-telling of the Tristan and Iseult myth in modern circumstances, was left unfinished at Quiller-Couch&#x27;s death and was completed many years later by Daphne du Maurier. As she wrote in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; in April 1962, she began the job with considerable trepidation, at the request of Quiller-Couch&#x27;s daughter and &quot;in memory of happy evenings long ago when &#x27;Q&#x27; was host at Sunday supper&quot;.

He features as a main character, played by Leo McKern, in the 1992 BBC television feature &quot;The Last Romantics&quot;. The story focuses on his relationship with his protégé, F. R. Leavis, and the students.

His Cambridge inaugural lecture series, published as &quot;On the Art of Writing&quot;, is the source of the popular writers&#x27; adage &quot;murder your darlings&quot;:

<text>Zaya Pandita Namkhaijamts (, 1599–1662) was a Mongolian Tibetan Buddhist missionary priest and scholar of Oirat origin who is the most prominent Oirat Buddhist scholar. Among his accomplishments is the invention of the Clear Script.

==Biography==
Zaya Pandita was the fifth son of Babakhan, a minor Khoshut prince. After Babakhan converted to Tibetan Buddhism in the early 17th century, he, like many other Oirat princes, wished for one of his sons to enter the Buddhist clergy. In pursuit of his wish, Babakhan chose Zaya to become a śrāmaṇera (&quot;novice monk&quot;). In 1615, Zaya journeyed to Lhasa where he would study and practice Buddhism, including study under the guidance of the Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama.

In 1638, Zaya Pandita left Tibet at the direction of the Panchen Lama to conduct missionary work among the Mongols. One year later in 1640, he assisted Erdeni Batur, Khun Taiyishi of the Choros (Oirats) tribe, in assembling a pan-Mongol conference between the Oirat and the Khalkha Mongols. The purpose of the conference was to encourage the formation of a united Mongolian front against potential external enemies, such as the Kazakhs, Manchus, and Russians and to settle all internal matters peacefully. The conference produced a code, which provided protection from foreign aggression to both the Oirat and the Khalkha and guaranteed the free movement of people throughout Mongol land.

When not engaged in diplomacy between the Oirat and the Khalkha, Zaya Pandita spread Tibetan Buddhism to the Oirats, the Khalkha and even the Kalmyk people in far away Russia. In furtherance of his missionary work, Zaya Pandita composed a new alphabet, based on the traditional Mongolian alphabet, called &quot;Clear script&quot; (&quot;todo bichig&quot;) to transcribe the Oirat language as it is pronounced. By doing so, Zaya Pandita eliminated the ambiguities of the traditional Mongolian alphabet.
From the time Zaya Pandita developed the Clear Script in 1648 until his death in 1662, he translated approximately 186 Buddhist texts from Tibetan language to the Oirat language while still serving the religious needs of the Oirat tribes in Dzungaria.

The todo bichig script is still used by Oirats in Xinjiang with slight revisions, and is taught alongside standard classical written Mongolian in that region.

<text>Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are medicines sold directly to a consumer without a requirement for a prescription from a healthcare professional, as opposed to prescription drugs, which may be supplied only to consumers possessing a valid prescription. In many countries, OTC drugs are selected by a regulatory agency to ensure that they contain ingredients that are safe and effective when used without a physician&#x27;s care. OTC drugs are usually regulated according to their active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and strengths of final products. 

The term &quot;over-the-counter&quot; (&quot;OTC&quot;) refers to a medication that can be purchased without a medical prescription. In contrast, prescription drugs require a prescription from a doctor or other health care professional and should only be used by the prescribed individual. Some drugs may be legally classified as over-the-counter (i.e. no prescription is required), but may only be dispensed by a pharmacist after an assessment of the patient&#x27;s needs or the provision of patient education. Regulations detailing the establishments where drugs may be sold, who is authorized to dispense them, and whether a prescription is required vary considerably from country to country.

==Usage==
As of 2011, around a third of older adults in the U.S. reportedly used OTC drugs, and this number is increasing. By 2018, the prevalence of use by adults in the U.S. as first-line treatment for minor illnesses had reached 81%: however, there is some debate as to whether this figure relates to an actual improvement of health.

==Regulation by country==

===Canada===
In Canada, there are four drug schedules:
* Schedule 1: Requires a prescription for sale and is provided to the public by a licensed pharmacist.
* Schedule 2: Does not require a prescription but requires an assessment by a pharmacist prior to sale. These drugs are kept in an area of the pharmacy where there is no public access and may also be referred to as &quot;behind-the-counter&quot; drugs.
* Schedule 3: Does not require a prescription but must be kept in an area under the supervision of a pharmacist. These drugs are kept in an area of the retail outlet where self-selection is possible, but a pharmacist must be available to assist in the self-selection of medication if required.
* Unscheduled: Does not require a prescription and may be sold in any retail outlet.

All medications other than Schedule 1 may be considered an OTC drug, as they do not require prescriptions for sale. While the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities provides recommendations on the scheduling of drugs for sale in Canada, each province may determine its own scheduling. The drugs found in each schedule may vary from province to province.

=== India ===
In November 2016, India&#x27;s Drug Consultative Committee announced it was embarking on establishing a definition of drugs which could be dispensed without a prescription. Prior to this, the general assumption was that any drug which did not fall into a prescription schedule could be purchased without a prescription. However, the needed definition had not been enacted by early 2018. The lack of a legal definition for OTC drugs has led to this market segment being effectively unregulated.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there are four categories:

* UR (Uitsluitend Recept): prescription only
* UA (Uitsluitend Apotheek): pharmacist only
* UAD (Uitsluitend Apotheek of Drogist): pharmacist or drugstore only
* AV (Algemene Verkoop): may be sold in general stores

A drug that is UA may be sold OTC but only by pharmacists. The drug can be on the shelves like any other product. Examples are domperidone, 400 mg ibuprofen up to 50 tablets and dextromethorphan. A drug that is UAD can also be sold at drugstores which are stores where no prescription can be filled. The drugs are usually on the shelves, and the store also sells items like toys, gadgets, perfumes and homeopathic products. The drugs in this category have limited risk and addiction potential. Examples are naproxen and diclofenac in small amounts, cinnarizine, 400 mg ibuprofen up to 20 tablets and also 500 mg paracetamol up to 50 tablets. Drugs in the AV category can be sold at supermarkets, gas stations, etc. and include only drugs with minimal risk to the public, like paracetamol up to 20 tablets, 200 mg ibuprofen up to 10 tablets, cetirizine and loperamide.

===United States===
In the United States, the manufacture and sale of OTC substances are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA requires that all &quot;new drugs&quot; obtain a New Drug Application (NDA) before entering interstate commerce, but the act exempts any drugs generally recognized as safe and effective (GRAS/E). To deal with the vast number of OTC drugs that were already on the market before the requirement that all drugs obtain an NDA, the FDA created the OTC monograph system to review classes of drugs and to categorize them as GRAS/E after review by expert panels. Certain classes of OTC drugs would not be required to obtain an NDA and could remain on the market if they conformed to the monograph guidelines for doses, labeling, and warnings finalized in the Code of Federal Regulations

Thus, an OTC drug product is allowed to be marketed either (1) pursuant to an FDA monograph or (2) pursuant to an NDA for products that do not fit within a specific monograph. There is also the possibility that certain OTC drug products are marketed under the grandfathering provisions of the &quot;Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act&quot;, but the FDA has never formally acknowledged that any legitimate grandfathered OTC drug exists.

Examples of OTC substances approved in the United States are sunscreens, anti-microbial and anti-fungal products, external and internal analgesics such as lidocaine and aspirin, psoriasis and eczema topical treatments, anti-dandruff shampoos containing coal tar, and other topical products with a therapeutic effect.

The Federal Trade Commission regulates advertising of OTC products, in contrast to prescription drug advertising, which is regulated by the FDA.

The FDA requires OTC products to be labeled with an approved &quot;Drug Facts&quot; label to educate consumers about their medications. The labels comply to a standard format and are intended to be easy for typical consumers to understand. Drug Facts labels include information on the product&#x27;s active ingredient(s), indications and purpose, safety warnings, directions for use, and inactive ingredients.

The 2020 &quot;Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act&quot; (CARES Act) includes reforms that modernize the way certain OTC drugs are regulated in the United States. Many OTC monographs need to be updated but updating or changing an OTC monograph requires the slow and burdensome notice-and-comment rulemaking process. The CARES Act includes OTC monograph reform provisions that replace the rulemaking process with an administrative order process.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, medication is governed by the Medicines Regulations 2012. Medication falls into one of three categories:

# Prescription Only Medication (POM), which is legally available only with a valid prescription from a prescriber. A pharmacist has to be on the premises for POM medicines to be dispensed, required by law. The medicine has been specifically prescribed for the patient holding the prescription, so it is considered safe for only the recipient to take. Just a small example of these include most antibiotics and all antidepressants or antidiabetic medications. Certain POM medicines are additionally marked Controlled Drug (CD) due to risk of abuse and the possibility of diversion for sale as street drugs. Examples of CDs include all benzodiazepines and strong opioids such as heroin and fentanyl.
# General Sales List (GSL), available off the shelf with no pharmacy training required to sell (so they can be sold anywhere, such as supermarkets). In general, they are considered safe for most people when taken correctly. Examples of these include 16-packs (or less) of painkillers such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin as well as a host of other medications such as small pack sizes of some antihistamines, some laxative medication, and skin creams. This also includes the recreational substances alcohol and caffeine (where they are included in medicinal products), and some nicotine preparations.
# Pharmacy Medicines (P) are medicines that are legally neither a POM or GSL medication. These can be sold from a registered pharmacy but should not be available for self-selection (although directions to discuss a &#x27;P&#x27; product may be allocated shelf space with associated GSL items). &#x27;P&#x27; medications are reserved from the GSL list as they are either associated with a need for advice on use, or used in conditions which may require referral to a medical prescriber. Suitably trained counter assistants may sell a &#x27;P&#x27; medication under the supervision of a pharmacist and will ask questions to determine if the customer needs to be referred for a discussion with a pharmacist. Some &#x27;POM&#x27; medicines are available for use in certain situations and doses as &#x27;P&#x27; medicines.

If it is not appropriate to sell a &#x27;P&#x27; medication – i.e. the condition is not suitable for self-management and requires referral to a medical prescriber – then a sale should not occur and the pharmacist has a legal and professional obligation to refer this on to an appropriate service.

Examples of these include some sleep aid tablets such as diphenhydramine, human deworming tablets such as mebendazole, painkillers with small amounts of codeine (up to 12.8 mg per tablet), and pseudoephedrine. Medication available only with a prescription is marked somewhere on the box/container with [POM]. Pharmacy-only products are marked with [P]. A prescription is not required for [P] medicines, and pharmacy sales assistants are required by Royal Pharmaceutical Society codes to ask certain questions, which varies for what the customer says. If they ask for a specific product, the pharmacy assistant must ask &quot;Who is it for?&quot;, &quot;How long have you had the symptoms?&quot;, &quot;Are you allergic to any medication?&quot;, &quot;Are you taking any medication?&quot; (&#x27;WHAM&#x27; questions). If a customer asks for a remedy, e.g., hay fever, then the &#x27;2WHAM questions&#x27; must be asked &quot;Who is it for?&quot;, &quot;What are the symptoms?&quot;, &quot;How long have you had the symptoms?&quot;, &quot;Have you taken any action towards your symptoms?&quot;, and &quot;Are you taking any other medication?&quot;. It is with this information that the pharmacist can halt the sale, if need be. No [POM], [P] or [GSL] products that are stocked in a pharmacy can be sold, dispensed, or pre-made until a responsible pharmacist is signed in and on the premises. Some medication available in supermarkets and petrol stations is sold only in smaller packet sizes. Often, larger packs will be marked as [P] and available only from a pharmacy. Frequently, customers buying larger-than-usual doses of [P] medicines (such as DXM, promethazine, codeine or Gee&#x27;s Linctus) will be queried, due to the possibility of abuse.

==Transitions between prescription and OTC==
As a general rule, over-the-counter drugs have to be used primarily to treat a condition that does not require the direct supervision of a doctor and must be proven to be reasonably safe and well tolerated. OTC drugs are usually also required to have little or no abuse potential, although in some areas drugs such as codeine are available OTC (usually in strictly limited formulations or requiring paperwork or identification to be submitted during purchase).

Over time, often 3–6 years, drugs that prove themselves safe and appropriate as prescription medicines may be switched from prescription to OTC. An example of this is diphenhydramine (Benadryl), an anti-histamine which once required a prescription but now is available OTC nearly everywhere. More recent examples are cimetidine and loratadine in the United States, and ibuprofen in Australia.

It is somewhat unusual for an OTC drug to be withdrawn from the market as a result of safety concerns, rather than market forces, though it does happen occasionally. For example, phenylpropanolamine was removed from sale in the United States over concern regarding strokes in young women. A study has been done examining consumer&#x27;s perceptions about the risk of and access to nonprescription medication. The study concluded that a small percentage of consumers prefer having access to medication over potential risks of taking non-prescribed medication. Ranitidine was suspended in multiple markets due to concerns over the presence of the carcinogen &quot;N&quot;-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA).

In the United Kingdom, it was announced in February 2007 that Boots the Chemist would try over-the-counter sales of Viagra in stores in Manchester, England (previous available as prescription only). Men aged between 30 and 65 could buy four tablets after a consultation with a pharmacist.

<text>A CD player is an electronic device that plays audio compact discs, which are a digital optical disc data storage format. CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or audiobooks. CD players may be part of home stereo systems, car audio systems, personal computers, or portable CD players such as CD boomboxes. Most CD players produce an output signal via a headphone jack or RCA jacks. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a hi-fi (or other amplifier) and loudspeakers for listening to music. To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack.

Modern units can play audio formats other than the original CD PCM audio coding, such as MP3, AAC and WMA. DJs playing dance music at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the pitch and tempo of the music. Audio engineers using CD players to play music for an event through a sound reinforcement system use professional audio-grade CD players. CD playback functionality is also available on CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive-equipped computers as well as on DVD players and most optical disc-based home video game consoles.

==History==
American inventor James T. Russell is known for inventing the first system to record digital video information on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp. Russell&#x27;s patent application was first filed in 1966, and he was granted a patent in 1970. Following litigation, Sony and Philips licensed Russell&#x27;s recording patents (then held by a Canadian company, Optical Recording Corp.) in the 1980s.

The compact disc is not based on Russell&#x27;s invention; it is an evolution of LaserDisc technology, where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals. Prototypes were developed by Philips and Sony independently in the late 1970s. In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the &quot;Red Book&quot; CD-DA standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984. The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between Philips and Sony, who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.

The Sony CDP-101, released in 1982, was the world&#x27;s first commercially released compact disc player. It was originally sold only in Japan.

Unlike early LaserDisc players, first CD players already used laser diodes instead of larger helium-neon lasers.

===Digital audio laser-disc prototypes===
In 1974, Lou Ottens, director of the audio division of Philips, started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record. However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974. In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc. The diameter of Philips&#x27;s prototype compact disc was set at , the diagonal of an audio cassette.

Heitaro Nakajima, who developed an early digital audio recorder within Japan&#x27;s national public broadcasting organization NHK in 1970, became general manager of Sony&#x27;s audio department in 1971. His team developed a digital PCM adaptor audio tape recorder using a Betamax video recorder in 1973. After this, in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made. Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100 Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056 Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony&#x27;s digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in Brussels. Sony&#x27;s AES technical paper was published on 1 March 1979. A week later, on 8 March, Philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called &quot;Philips Introduce Compact Disc&quot; in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

===Collaboration and standardization===

Sony executive Norio Ohga, later CEO and chairman of Sony, and Heitaro Nakajima were convinced of the format&#x27;s commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism. As a result, in 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc. Led by engineers Kees Schouhamer Immink and Toshitada Doi, the research pushed forward laser and optical disc technology. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the &quot;Red Book&quot; CD-DA standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the IEC as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.

Philips coined the term &quot;compact disc&quot; in line with another audio product, the Compact Cassette, and contributed the general manufacturing process, based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed eight-to-fourteen modulation (EFM), which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints, while Sony contributed the error-correction method, CIRC. The &quot;Compact Disc Story&quot;, told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter. The task force consisted of around four to eight persons, though according to Philips, the compact disc was &quot;invented collectively by a large group of people working as a team.&quot;

===First &quot;Red Book&quot; CDs and players===
&quot;Red Book&quot; was the first standard in the Rainbow Books series of standards.

Philips established the Polydor Pressing Operations plant in Langenhagen near Hannover, Germany, and quickly passed a series of milestones.

* The first &quot;test pressing&quot; was of a recording of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Eine Alpensinfonie&quot; (&quot;An Alpine Symphony&quot;) played by the Berlin Philharmonic and conducted by Herbert von Karajan, who had been enlisted as an ambassador for the format in 1979.
* The first &quot;public demonstration&quot; was on the BBC television program &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; in 1981, when the Bee Gees&#x27; album &quot;Living Eyes&quot; (1981) was played.
* The first &quot;commercial&quot; compact disc was produced on 17 August 1982. It was a recording from 1979 of Claudio Arrau performing Chopin waltzes (Philips 400 025-2). Arrau was invited to the Langenhagen plant to press the start button.
* The first &quot;popular music&quot; CD produced at the new factory was &quot;The Visitors&quot; (1981) by ABBA.
* The first 50 titles were &quot;released&quot; in Japan on 1 October 1982, with the first-cataloged CD in this wave being a reissue of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;52nd Street&quot;.

The Japanese launch was followed in March 1983 by the introduction of CD players and discs to Europe and North America (where CBS Records released sixteen titles). This event is often seen as the &quot;Big Bang&quot; of the digital audio revolution. The new audio disc was enthusiastically received, especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities, and its handling quality received particular praise. As the price of players gradually came down, and with the introduction of the portable Walkman, the CD began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets. The first artist to sell a million copies on CD was Dire Straits, with their 1985 album &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. The first major artist to have his entire catalog converted to CD was David Bowie, whose 15 studio albums were made available by RCA Records in February 1985, along with four greatest hits albums. In 1988, 400 million CDs were manufactured by 50 pressing plants around the world.

===Further development and decline===

The CD was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music, rather than primarily as a data storage medium, but from its origins as a format for music, its use has grown to encompass other applications. In 1983, following the CD&#x27;s introduction, Immink and Braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd AES Convention. In June 1985, the computer-readable CD-ROM (read-only memory) was introduced and, in 1990, the CD-Recordable, also developed by both Sony and Philips. Recordable CDs were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without the defects introduced in the compression used in other digital recording methods. Other newer video formats such as DVD and Blu-ray use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio CD.

By the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the audio cassette player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player. Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.

Some CD players incorporate disc changers. Commonly these can hold 3, 5, 6, or 10 discs at once and change from one disc to the next without user intervention. Disc changers capable of holding up to 400 discs at once were available. Also, the user can manually choose the disc to be played, making it similar to a jukebox. They were often built into car audio and home stereo systems, although 7 disc CD changers were once made by NEC and Nakamichi for PCs. Some could also play DVD and Blu-ray discs.

Meanwhile, with the advent and popularity of Internet-based distribution of files in lossily-compressed audio formats such as MP3, sales of CDs began to decline in the 2000s. For example, between 2000 and 2008, despite overall growth in music sales and one anomalous year of increase, major-label CD sales declined overall by 20% – although independent and DIY music sales may be tracking better (according to figures released 30 March 2009), and CDs still continue to sell greatly. As of 2012, CDs and DVDs made up only 34 percent of music sales in the United States. In Japan, however, over 80 percent of music was bought on CDs and other physical formats as of 2015. As of 2020, compact cassettes, vinyl records, and CDs are still being released by some musicians, primarily as merchandise, to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return.

==Inner workings==
The process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray that either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the circular data tracks using a laser beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analog servo amplifiers and then the high-frequency analog signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analog audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.

===Analog signal recovery from the disc===

To read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low-mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600 nm wide data track.

When the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.

Different brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north–south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servo amplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.

Another servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.

Two optical pick-up designs exist, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centered by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the center.

The other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few micrometers apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.

The sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high-frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic eye pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.

===Digital signal processing===
The first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called EFM (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the CIRC error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.
The EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.

After demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a SRAM memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a DAC to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.

The Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.

===Player control===
The Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or microcontroller to orchestrate the entire machine. The firmware of basic CD players typically is a real-time operating system.

Some early optical computer drives are equipped with an audio connector and buttons for standalone CD playback functionality.

==Tray design types==

===Tray loading===
Sony released its CDP-101 CD player in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD. As it was easy to manufacture and to use, most CD player manufacturers stayed with the tray style ever since. The tray mechanism is also used in many modern desktop computer cases, as well as the Philips CD-i, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360. However, there have been some notable exceptions to this common CD tray design.

===Vertical loading===
During the launch of the first prototype &quot;Goronta&quot; CD player by Sony at the Japanese Audio Fair in 1982, Sony showcased the vertical loading design. Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including Alpine/Luxman, Matsushita under the Technics brand, Kenwood and Toshiba/Aurex. For the early vertical loading players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman, Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand). Kenwood added their &quot;Sigma Drive&quot; outputs to this design as a modification. A picture of this early design can be seen on the Panasonic Web site. The vertical loading is similar the one common in cassette decks, where the holder opens, and disc is dropped to it. The holder is closed manually, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine vertical loading with slot loading due to the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.

===Top loading===
In 1983, Philips, at the US and European launch of the CD format, showcased the first top-loading CD tray designs with their CD100 CD player. (Philips audio products were sold as Magnavox in the US at the time.) The design had a clamp on the lid which meant the user had to close this over the CD when it was placed inside the machine. Later, Meridian introduced their MCD high end CD player, with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.

Top-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made. Examples include Luxman&#x27;s D-500 and D-500X series players and Denon&#x27;s DP-S1, both launched in 1993.
Top-loading is also common in players intended for broadcast and live sound DJ use, such as Technics&#x27; SL-P50 (1984–1985) and Technics SL-P1200 (1986–1992). They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.

The top-loading disc tray design is also used in most fifth-generation video game consoles (PlayStation, Saturn, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer), as well as the Dreamcast, GameCube, and Wii Mini.
===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===

The Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically, as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player&#x27;s transport system also came out as one unit. The Meridians 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism. A similar mechanism is used in slim optical disc drives (also known as slim internal DVD drive, optical drive or DVD burner), which were once commonly used in laptop computers.

===Slot loading===

Slot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back Mini CDs without the need of an adapter (such as the original Wii model&#x27;s standard-sized disc slot being capable of accepting smaller GameCube Game Discs) but they may work with limited functionality (a disc changer with a Mini CD inserted will refuse to operate until such disc is removed, for example).
Non-circular CDs cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism. It is also used on some laptop computers, the original and slim PlayStation 3, the Wii&#x27;s original model and its Family Edition and most eighth-generation video game consoles (the Wii U, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One), as well as the ninth-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

==Pickup mechanisms==

Two types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:
* The swing-arm mechanism, originally designed by Philips – the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a record player. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.
* The radial mechanism, designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s – the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.

The swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not skip when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts. The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a hard drive moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.
This mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.
The linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more helper photodiodes.

==Mechanical components==
A CD player has three major mechanical components: a drive motor, a lens system or pickup head, and a tracking mechanism.
The drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2–1.4 m/s (constant linear velocity) – equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a laser beam produced by a laser diode. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc&#x27;s mirrored surface back to a photodiode array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed and eventually converted to sound using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).

A TOC or Table of Contents is located after the &quot;lead-in&quot; area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated three times before the first music program starts. The &quot;lead out&quot; area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.

==CD player features==

CD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player&#x27;s intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ&#x27;s CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:

*&quot;Oversampling&quot; is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1 kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.
*&quot;One-bit DACs&quot; were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.
*&quot;Dual DACs&quot; were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.
*&quot;Anti-skip or Antishock&quot;, is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a RAM chip installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM memory buffer for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Typical players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 Mbit RAM chip.

==Portable CD players==

===Small portable players===

A portable CD player is a portable audio player used to play compact discs. Portable CD players are powered by batteries and they have a 1/8&quot; headphone jack into which the user plugs a pair of headphones. The first portable CD player released was the D-50 by Sony. The D-50 was made available on the market in 1984, and adopted for Sony&#x27;s entire portable CD player line.

In 1998, portable MP3 players began to compete with portable CD players. After Apple Computer entered the music player market with its iPod line, within ten years it became the dominant seller of portable digital audio players, &quot;...while former giant Sony (maker of the [portable] Walkman and [CD] Discman [was] struggling.&quot; This market shift was initiated when the first portable digital audio player, the Rio digital music player, was introduced. The 64 MB Rio MP3 player enabled users to store about 20 songs. One of the benefits of the Rio over portable CD players was that since the Rio had no moving parts, it offered skip-free playback. Since 1998, the price of portable digital audio players has dropped and the storage capacity has increased significantly. In the 2000s, users can &quot;carry [their] entire music collection in a [digital audio] player the size of a cigarette package.&quot; The 4 GB iPod, for example, holds over 1,000 songs. By the early 2010s, MP3 players began to decline in popularity, in favour of downloading music on platforms such as iTunes, and later streaming music on platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube Music.

===Boomboxes===

A boombox is a common term for a portable cassette and AM/FM radio that consists of an amplifier, two or more loudspeakers and a carrying handle. Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player that produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for headphones or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by batteries as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a suitcase. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.

Most boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with CD-R and CD-RW, which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium. Many also permit iPod and similar devices to be plugged into them through one or more auxiliary input jacks. Some also support formats such as MP3 and WMA. Another modern variant is a DVD player/boombox with a top-loading CD/DVD drive and an LCD video screen in the position once occupied by a cassette deck. Many models of this type of boombox include inputs for external video (such as television broadcasts) and outputs to connect the DVD player to a full-sized television.

==DJ equipment==

Disc jockeys (DJs) who are playing a mix of songs at a dance club, rave, or nightclub create their dance mixes by having songs playing on two or more sound sources and using a DJ mixer to transition seamlessly between songs. In the 1970s disco era, DJs typically used two record players. From the 1980s to the 1990s, two compact cassette players became a popular sound source for DJs. In subsequent decades, DJs shifted to CDs and then to digital audio players. DJs who use CDs and CD players typically use specialized DJ CD players that have features not available on regular CD players.

DJs who are performing scratching–the creation of rhythmic sounds and sound effects from sound recordings–traditionally used vinyl records and turntables. In the 2010s, some specialized DJ CD players can be used to create the same scratching effects using songs on CDs.

<text>Fevers and Mirrors is the third studio album by American indie band Bright Eyes, recorded in 1999 and released on May 29, 2000. It was the 32nd release of the Omaha, Nebraska-based record label Saddle Creek Records. The album was released later in 2000 in the United Kingdom as the inaugural release from Wichita Recordings.

The album begins with a recording of a little boy reading &quot;Mitchell Is Moving&quot;, a book by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat. &quot;An Attempt to Tip the Scales&quot; includes what is ostensibly an interview with the band&#x27;s frontman, Conor Oberst. However, Oberst has admitted that the interview was something of a joke, intended to poke fun at the dark tone of the album. Conor&#x27;s voice is impersonated in the interview by Todd Fink of The Faint and Commander Venus. The man interviewing is Matt Silcock, a former member of Lullaby for the Working Class.

The album was reissued alongside a six-track companion EP by Dead Oceans on May 27, 2022.

==Critical reception==
The music online magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot; at number 170 on its list of top 200 albums of the 2000s, despite a low initial score of 5.4/10. In 2012, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Ian Cohen gave the reissued version of the album a 9.0 out of 10.

<doc id="192053" wikidata="Q464309" url="?curid=192053" title="Copyright Duration Directive">
<text>Council Directive 93/98/EEC of 29 October 1993 harmonising the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights is a European Union directive in the field of EU copyright law, made under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome. It was replaced by the 2006 Copyright Term Directive (2006/116/EC).

== Duration of protection ==
The principal goal was to ensure that there was a single duration for copyright and related rights across the entire European Union. The chosen term for a work was 70 years from the death of the author (&quot;post mortem auctoris&quot;, pma) for authors&#x27; rights regardless of when the work was first lawfully published (Art. 1), longer than the 50-year &quot;post mortem auctoris&quot; term required by the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Art. 7.1 Berne Convention). In the case that the author is anonymous or pseudonymous the term for a work is 70 years from the date of first lawful publication. The directive notes that the original goal of the Berne Convention was to protect works for two generations after the death of the author, and that fifty years was no longer sufficient for this purpose (para. 5 of the preamble). It is often stated that 70 years pma was the longest copyright term of any Member State at the time: this is not strictly correct, and is not quoted as the reason for the choice in the directive. Where a Member State protected a work for a longer period at the time the directive came into force, the copyright term is not reduced [Art. 10(1)], but other Member States will not respect the longer period.

The duration of protection of related rights (those of performers, phonogram and film producers and broadcasting organisations) was set at fifty years with the following rules for calculating the starting date (Art. 3). This fifty-year period was in reflexion of the negotiating position of the European Community at the negotiations which led to the Marrakech Agreements, including the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).

=== Copyright restoration ===
The new copyright terms applied also to works which were already in existence when it came into force, as was held by the European Court of Justice in the &quot;Butterfly&quot; case, even if they had previously entered the public domain. Strictly, they applied to works which were protected in at least one Member State on 1 July 1995, although most Member States chose to apply them to all works which would qualify on the basis of the protection terms, regardless of protection elsewhere: this approach is much simpler for national courts to apply, as they do not have to consider foreign laws.

The effect of the approach was shown by the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the &quot;Puccini&quot; case, which covered facts arising before the directive entered force. The State of Hesse in Germany had staged the opera &quot;La Bohème&quot; by Puccini during the 1993/94 season at the Hessische Staatstheater Wiesbaden without the permission of the copyright holder. The opera was first published in Italy and Puccini died on 29 November 1924. At the time, Italy applied a copyright period of 56 years pma, so Italian protection had expired at the end of 1980: Germany, however, applied a 70 years pma period to works of German authors and the &quot;rule of the shorter term&quot; (Art. 7.8 Berne Convention) to foreign works. The Court ruled that the application of the rule of the shorter term between Member States was a breach of the principle of non-discrimination enshrined in Article 12 of the Treaty instituting the European Community: hence the work should have been protected in Germany even if it was no longer protected in Italy. Such cases should no longer arise with the implementation of the directive.

== Films and photographs ==
The directive also harmonises the copyright treatment of films (&quot;cinematographic and other audiovisual works&quot;) and photographs throughout the European Union. Films are protected for 70 years from the death of the last of the following people to die [Art. 2(2)]: the principal director, the author of the screenplay, the author of the dialogue and the composer of music specifically created for use in the cinematographic or audiovisual work. This applies regardless of the provisions of national law regarding the authorship of the film, ensuring a common duration of copyright between Member States. The principal director of the film is always considered as an author of the film, although national legislations may provide for other co-authors [Art. 2(1)].

Before the directive, different Member States had applied widely different criteria of originality and creativity to the copyright protection of photographs. These were harmonised by article 6, which states that the only permissible criterion for full protection (70 years pma) is that the photograph is &quot;original in the sense that [it is] the author&#x27;s own intellectual creation&quot;. Member States may protect photographs which do not meet this criterion by &quot;sui generis&quot; related rights.

== Previously unpublished works ==
The directive accords a publication right to the publisher of a public domain work which was previously unpublished, for 25 years after the date of publication (Art. 4). The work must have been &quot;legally published&quot;. In some countries (e.g. France), authors and their heirs have a perpetual right to authorise (or not) the publication of a work and, in these cases, publication must be with the consent of the holders of the moral rights in the work.

== Other provisions ==
As is normal in the field of copyright law, all periods of protection run until the end of the calendar year in which they would otherwise expire (Art. 8). Member states may protect &quot;critical and scientific publications of works which have come into the public domain&quot; for a maximum of thirty years (Art. 5). The protection of moral rights is left to national legislation (Art. 9).

<doc id="192059" wikidata="Q958630" url="?curid=192059" title="Astounding Award for Best New Writer">
<text>The &quot;Astounding&quot; Award for Best New Writer (formerly the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer) is given annually to the best new writer whose first professional work of science fiction or fantasy was published within the two previous calendar years. It is named after &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (now &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;), a foundational science fiction magazine. The award is sponsored by Dell Magazines, which publishes &quot;Analog&quot;. 

Between its founding in 1973 and 2019, the award was named after &quot;Astounding&quot;″s long-time editor John W. Campbell, one of the most influential figures in the early history of science fiction. In the aftermath of 2019 winner Jeannette Ng&#x27;s acceptance speech, in which she described Campbell as a fascist, the science fiction fandom community discussed whether it was appropriate to continue honoring Campbell in this way; the editor of &quot;Analog&quot; subsequently announced that the award had been renamed.

The nomination and selection process is administered by the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS), represented by the current Worldcon committee, and the award is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony at the Worldcon, although it is not itself a Hugo Award. All nominees receive a pin, while the winner receives a plaque. Beginning in 2005, the award has also included a tiara; created at the behest of 2004 winner Jay Lake and 2005 winner Elizabeth Bear, the tiara is passed from each year&#x27;s winner to the next.

==Eligibility and voting==
Writers are eligible for the &quot;Astounding&quot; Award for two years, and become eligible once they have a work of science fiction or fantasy published in a professional publication. Final decisions on eligibility are decided by the Hugo Administrators while qualification criteria are set by the sponsor, Dell Magazine. The eligibility criteria for what counts as a professional publication are roughly similar to those of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA). As of 2023, qualifying publications must meet at least one of the following criteria: be accepted by SFWA; have at least 10,000 readers; pay the writer at least 8 cents a word and a total of at least US$80; or be self-published or published through a small press, with earnings for the author of at least US$3,000 in one year.

Members of the current and previous Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the six most-nominated writers—five prior to 2017—with additional nominees possible in the case of ties. Voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. 

Works by winners and nominees of the award were collected in the &quot;New Voices&quot; series of anthologies, edited by George R. R. Martin, which had five volumes covering the awards from 1973 through 1977 and which were published between 1977 and 1984. Michael A. Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated is not on sales but instead that it gives credibility with established authors and publishers. Criticism has been raised about the award that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.

Over the 52 years the award has been active, 218 writers have been nominated. Of these, 53 authors have won, including one tie. There have been 60 writers who were nominated twice, 21 of whom won the award in their second nomination.

==Winners and nominees==
In the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than the year when the writer&#x27;s eligible work was first published. Each year links to the corresponding &quot;year in literature&quot;. Although the award is not given explicitly for any particular work, and such works are not recorded by the World Science Fiction Society or Dell Magazines, a selection of works that the writer in question published in the eligibility period are listed. This list includes novels and short stories, and is not intended to be comprehensive. Entries with a yellow background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a gray background are the other nominees on the shortlist.

<doc id="192060" wikidata="Q902812" url="?curid=192060" title="Soyuz 7K-T No.39">
<text>Soyuz 7K-T No.39 (also named Soyuz 18a or Soyuz 18-1 by some sources and also known as the April 5 Anomaly) was an unsuccessful launch of a crewed Soyuz spacecraft by the Soviet Union in 1975. The mission was expected to dock with the orbiting Salyut 4 space station, but due to a failure of the Soyuz launch vehicle the crew failed to make orbit. The crew consisted of commander Vasily Lazarev, and flight engineer Oleg Makarov, a civilian. Although the mission was aborted and did not accomplish its objective, the craft exceeded common space boundaries and therefore is recognized as a sub-orbital spaceflight, which the crew survived. The crew, who initially feared they had landed in China, were successfully recovered.

The accident was partly disclosed by the normally secretive Soviets as it occurred during preparations for their joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project with the United States which flew three months later. Lazarev never flew to space again and never fully recovered from the accident; Makarov made two more flights on board a Soyuz (both of which were to the Salyut 6 space station).

== Crew ==
=== Backup crew ===
== Mission highlights ==
Soyuz 7K-T No.39 was intended to be the second mission to take cosmonauts to the Soviet Salyut 4 space station for a 60-day mission. Both cosmonauts were on their second mission and had flown their first mission together, Soyuz 12, in September 1973 to test a new type of Soyuz spacecraft after the fatal accident of Soyuz 11.

The launch proceeded according to plan until T+288.6 seconds at an altitude of , when the second and third stages of the booster began separation. Only three of the six locks holding the stages together released and the third stage&#x27;s engine ignited with the second stage still attached below it. The third stage&#x27;s thrust broke the remaining locks, throwing the second stage free but putting the booster under unexpected strain that caused it to deviate from the proper trajectory. At T+295 seconds, the deviation was detected by the Soyuz&#x27;s guidance system, which activated an automatic abort program. As the escape tower was long gone by this point, the abort had to be performed with the Soyuz&#x27;s own engines. This separated the spacecraft from the third-stage booster and then separated the orbital and service modules of the Soyuz from the re-entry capsule. At the time, when the safety system initiated separation the spacecraft was already pointed downward toward Earth, which accelerated its descent significantly. Instead of the expected acceleration in such an emergency situation of 15 &quot;g&quot; (147 m/s²), the cosmonauts experienced up to 21.3 g (209 m/s²). Despite very high overloading, the capsule&#x27;s parachutes opened properly and slowed the craft to a successful landing after a flight of only 21 minutes.

The capsule landed southwest of Gorno-Altaysk at a point north of the Chinese border. The capsule landed on a snow-covered slope and began rolling downhill towards a sheer drop before it was stopped by the parachutes becoming snagged on vegetation. Having landed in chest-deep powder snow and a local temperature of , the cosmonauts donned their cold-weather survival clothing. The cosmonauts were uncertain if they had landed in China, at a time when Sino-Soviet relations were extremely hostile, so they quickly destroyed documents relating to a military experiment planned for the flight. They reportedly exited the spacecraft shortly after landing and built a fire. Soon, the crew was in radio contact with a rescue team in an approaching helicopter, who confirmed they were in the Soviet Union, near the town of Aleysk. The deep snow, the high altitude, and the terrain meant the rescuers had great difficulty in making contact with the cosmonauts. It was the next day before they were safely airlifted out. The crew were returned to Star City; the capsule was recovered some time later.

Initial Soviet reports stated the men had suffered no ill effects from their flight. However, subsequent reports claimed that Lazarev was injured by the high acceleration of re-entry. Makarov went on to take part in Soyuz 26, Soyuz 27, and Soyuz T-3 missions.

In Brezhnev&#x27;s time, it was rare to disclose anything about Soviet failures, and so the first (Soviet) publication about the realities of the flight was made only a month later (8 May 1975). The Americans were informed on 7 April 1975 after the crew had been rescued. However, as the failure occurred during preparations for the joint Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the United States requested that a more detailed report of the accident be provided. (There was even a United States congressional inquiry regarding this failure and several others.) In the report the Soviets made to the Americans, the abort was referred to as the &quot;April 5th anomaly&quot;, and as this was the only term the Soviets ever used for the incident, that became the &quot;official&quot; designation for years afterwards. It was also disclosed that the booster used in the launch was an older model and not the same model that would be used for Soyuz 19. The mission is referred to in some literature as Soyuz 18a or Soyuz 18-1, since the following Soyuz mission in May 1975 received the name Soyuz 18. (The Soviets only gave numbers to successful launches.)

The exact landing site of the capsule was a subject of debate amongst space historians in subsequent years. A Russian source quoted by James Oberg has stated that the landing occurred in Mongolia.

The failed Soyuz mission was the only case of a crewed booster accident at high altitude until the accident with Soyuz MS-10 on 11 October 2018.

<text>The Gandalf Awards, honoring achievement in fantasy literature, were conferred by the World Science Fiction Society annually from 1974 to 1981. They were named after Gandalf the wizard, from the Middle-earth stories by J. R. R. Tolkien. The award was created and sponsored by Lin Carter and the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), an association of fantasy writers. Recipients were selected by vote of participants in the World Science Fiction Conventions according to procedures of the Hugo Awards.

The award was given for life achievement, and corresponds roughly to the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, which was started the year after the Gandalf. In 1978 and 1979, an award was also given for a novel published during the preceding year.

==Gandalf Grand Master Award ==
The Gandalf Grand Master Award for life achievement in fantasy writing was awarded every year from 1974 to 1981. The inaugural winner was J. R. R. Tolkien, recently deceased in 1973.
* 1974: J. R. R. Tolkien
* 1975: Fritz Leiber
* 1976: L. Sprague de Camp
* 1977: Andre Norton
* 1978: Poul Anderson
* 1979: Ursula K. Le Guin
* 1980: Ray Bradbury
* 1981: C. L. Moore

There was no ballot in 1981. All other winners since Tolkien were among the five or six finalists one year earlier. Others who appeared on the ballot were C. S. Lewis, Jack Vance, Roger Zelazny, Marion Zimmer Bradley, Anne McCaffrey, and Patricia McKillip.

==Gandalf Award for Book-Length Fantasy==
The Gandalf Award for Book-Length Fantasy was awarded only in 1978 and 1979.

* 1978: &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, J. R. R. Tolkien, edited by Christopher Tolkien

<doc id="192068" wikidata="Q205685" url="?curid=192068" title="SK Brann">
<text>Sportsklubben Brann is a Norwegian professional football club based in Bergen. Founded on 26 September 1908, Brann has played in the first tier of Norwegian football for 67 out of 80 seasons, the second most of any club. They play their home matches at Brann Stadion where they had a record-breaking average attendance of 17,310 in the 2007 season, the season in which they won their first league title since 1963.

==History==
As the biggest club in Norway&#x27;s second-largest city Bergen, Brann are historically one of the major clubs in Norway in terms of public interest, and hence there are high expectations for the club every season. Brann won their first Norwegian top flight titles in 1961–62 and 1963 Norwegian First Division, but after this Brann was only sporadically involved in the league title races. In 2007 they finally reclaimed the league title and thus ended a 44-year-long waiting period.

Despite their limited success, the club has never failed to spark considerable interest from the Norwegian media and the local population. Moreover, Brann have regularly been winners and runners-up of the Norwegian Cup. The club reached the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the 1996–97 season. The club has also earned a reputation for instability and drama both behind the scenes and on the pitch. Although the club has played the 2nd highest amount of seasons in the top flight, they have also been relegated from it 11 times, a feat only surpassed by Start.

=== 1900s, 1910s and 1920s: Formation and early successes ===
On 26 September 1908 Christen K. Gran gathered nine other young men to meet in a local café in Bergen. Due to dissatisfaction of the current state of the local sport clubs in Bergen, they decided to form a new football and skiing club. They called it Ski- og Fodboldklubben Brann &quot;(lit. The Ski and Football Club Fire)&quot;, on the suggestion of Birger Gjestland.

Brann played their first match against Bergens Fotballklubb (at the time the biggest local team) on New Year&#x27;s Day 1909, drawing 1–1. Brann recorded their first ever win in August of the same year, winning 3–2 against Stavanger IF away. During the first years Brann played well locally, but struggled to perform against teams from the eastern parts of the country. In 1912 club activities expanded to rowing and athletics. By 1915 Brann were established as the best team locally, and in 1916 they gained national attention with victories in Kristiania against top teams Lyn and Frigg. In 1917 they managed to qualify for the final of the Norwegian Football Cup for the first time ever. Brann lost the match 1–4 against Sarpsborg, but were now undisputedly among the top teams of Norway. They reached the final again in 1918, but with two of their best players missing due to falling ill with the Spanish flu, they again lost to an eastern team, this time Kvik Fredrikshald. The year also marked the first time a Brann player received an international call-up, with Sigurd Wathne playing in goal for Norway in games against Sweden and Denmark.

On 25 May 1919, with funding contributed by fans and investors, Brann Stadion was opened on a plot of land the club purchased in 1917. The opening match was against the Norwegian national team, losing 2–6, and the stadium also hosted the 1919 Norwegian Athletics Championships. In 1923 Brann reached the cup final for the third time, where they again faced an eastern team, this time finally winning. They beat Lyn 2–1 in the newly built Odd stadion, and secured the club&#x27;s first ever national title. Two years later Brann again faced Sarpsborg in the 1925 cup final, this time winning 3–0 and securing their second national title. In 1927 and 1931 the club expanded to its fifth and sixth sports in table tennis and orienteering respectively.

=== 1930s and 1940s: Stagnation, war and relegations ===

Brann faced a period of stagnation during the 1930s, and were for a period replaced as Bergen&#x27;s best football team by Hardy. In 1937 Brann played in the first ever national Norwegian football league, but did not make it out of the local division. During the German occupation of Norway official sports activities were boycotted en masse after the occupying government seized control of the national sporting confederation, and club activities were thus reduced to unofficial gatherings for the duration of World War II. Eleven Brann members lost their life in service for Norway during the war, among them football players Sigurd Wathne and Remi Øgård, who were respectively members of the merchant fleet and resistance.

Brann continued to play in the now smaller and more competitive national top division in the years after the war, until they were relegated for the first time in 1949. They were immediately promoted, and only months later they qualified for their fifth cup final after a 25-year absence, where they lost 0–3 to Fredrikstad. Brann won their division in the 1951–52 Norwegian Main League, and therefore qualified for the league championship final for the first time. They once again faced Fredrikstad and lost, this time 1–3. In the 1952–53 season Brann finished second to last in their division and were relegated from the top flight for the second time, but were once again immediately promoted the season afterwards. They were relegated for a third time in the 1955–56 season and were yet again promoted after a season&#x27;s absence. The 1959–60 season saw the debut of 17-year-old future club legend Roald &quot;Kniksen&quot; Jensen, but Brann were nonetheless relegated for a fourth time and were as usual immediately promoted.

=== 1960s: First league wins and long stay in the 2nd tier ===
The 1960s saw two of Norway&#x27;s most prolific players playing for Brann. With Roald &quot;Kniksen&quot; Jensen and Rolf Birger &quot;Pesen&quot; Pedersen on the team, Brann won their first league trophy in the so-called 1961–62 &quot;marathon league&quot;, where all 16 top division teams played in a single league for the first time, with half being relegated. Brann defended their title in the first regular season of single-division top flight football in 1963, adding a second league trophy to their cabinet. During the 1963 season, Brann had an average attendance of 15,486, which was the league record until 2003, when Rosenborg finally beat it with an average of 15,582.

In 1964, Brann were among the favorites to win their third consecutive league championship, but due to many injured players the team only won one of the first nine league games. Brann continued to struggle with injuries throughout the season, and were soon firmly stuck in the relegation battle. Before the last match of the season, Brann were one point behind Viking in the safe spots, and were facing the already relegated Raufoss at home. Even though Brann had the greatest chances to score a goal, Raufoss won the match 1–0, and Brann were shockingly relegated after back-to-back league wins. Following this Brann&#x27;s star player Roald &quot;Kniksen&quot; Jensen moved to Scotland to play for Hearts. Unlike with the previous three relegations Brann proved unable to immediately get promoted, missing out on promotion on goal difference.

Brann would not play in the top division again until 1968, the last with club legend Oddvar Hansen at the helm.

=== 1970s: Cup finals and title races ===

After some mediocre seasons Brann once again reached the cup final after more than 20 years of absence in 1972. They faced Rosenborg and won 1–0, securing their third cup title. This led to Brann qualifying for the 1973–74 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, their first qualification for a European tournament. They beat Gzira United 9–0 on aggregate before being eliminated by Glentoran in the second round. In 1974 the club&#x27;s athletics department was disbanded. In each of the seasons 1974–1976, Brann narrowly missed out on the league title, attracting an average attendance that was unheard of in Norway at the time. Although they missed out on the league title Brann won their fourth cup title in 1976, beating Sogndal in the final. Brann reached the final again in 1978, but lost to Lillestrøm.

=== 1980s: The &quot;yo-yo&quot; years ===
With the 1980s came Brann&#x27;s &quot;yo-yo&quot; era. Brann were relegated in 1979 and subsequently won the 2nd division in 1980, before being relegated again in 1981. The club would continue to alternate between the 1st and 2nd division every season until they finally avoided relegation in 1987. This was the world record for consecutive relegations and promotions from a top tier division until it was beaten by Aris Limassol in 2006. While in the 2nd division Brann won the cup for a fifth time in 1982, beating Molde in the final. In 1987 the skiing department disbanded, making Brann a club dedicated solely to football. Brann reached the cup final two consecutive seasons (1987 and 1988), where they lost to Bryne and Rosenborg respectively.

Brann had not had any real challenge from local rivals since the 1950s, being Bergen&#x27;s only representatives in the top tier. In 1989, however, Bergen-based Fyllingen were promoted to the first tier for the first time.

=== 1990s: Derbies, medals and brief European success ===
Unlike some other leagues, the top three teams of the Eliteserien are awarded medals. Silver and bronze medals are sometimes received with a shrug, but Brann&#x27;s dismal league history made them a top priority for the club in the 1990s. In 1990, Brann were involved in a decisive match against Rosenborg in the final round where they had the chance to clinch the league title, but lost and ended fourth. They lost out on their first medals since 1976 as local rivals Fyllingen conceded two vital goals against Molde in stoppage time. Only weeks prior to this, Fyllingen had beaten Brann in the Cup semi-finals, and their outspoken ambitions to take over the football hegemony in Bergen had by now become a major annoyance for Brann.

In 1991, after a shock resignation of manager Teitur Thordarson, Brann once again struggled, and needed a win in their last game against Strømsgodset in order make the play-off spots against two second-tier teams and avoid direct relegation. Losing the game would send Brann down, while securing play-offs for equally struggling local rivals Fyllingen. There were also fears that a relegation would spawn another long-term &quot;yo-yo era&quot;. A panic-stricken crowd saw Brann win the game 2–0. In the play-offs, though beating Strindheim at home, Brann still needed to beat Bryne away in a deciding match. A goal by Sten Glenn Håberg gave Brann a 1–0 win over Bryne, securing their survival.

In 1993 Brann got their two first-ever wins against their local rivals Fyllingen. A 6–1 thrashing in the penultimate league round sent Fyllingen down, while securing continued top division status for Brann. After the season, Brann purchased Fyllingen&#x27;s key player Per-Ove Ludvigsen, and this put an end to Fyllingen&#x27;s adventures in the top tier and the derby matches.

Brann were notorious for lacking a regular goal scorer ever since the 1970s, but this ended with Trond Egil Soltvedt&#x27;s many goals in 1993 and 1994. His extremely dedicated style, his innocent and somewhat naïve personality and the fact that many of his goals were scored as a midfielder made him immensely popular. Just before the start of the 1995 season, however, he was sacked by Brann&#x27;s board for &quot;disloyalty&quot;, the board refusing to elaborate on this. Disciplinary action was also taken against players Frank Strandli, Inge Ludvigsen and Claus Lundekvam. This caused a public outcry, and the issue was widely covered by the national media. There were demonstrations in the centre of Bergen, and the fans were split in their support to Soltvedt or to the board and manager Hallvar Thoresen. Attendances and the atmosphere on Brann Stadion initially plummeted as a result of this. The team spirit amongst players also seemed broken, and the first game against Molde F.K. was lost 6–0 at home, resulting in the entire crowd yelling for the board to resign. With Brann at bottom position halfway through the league season, Thoresen was sacked and Kjell Tennfjord, the manager behind Fyllingen&#x27;s success, was appointed. He steered Brann to an eventual mid-table position and led them to the club&#x27;s 12th cup final, again sparking immense optimism around the club even though Brann once again lost the final to Rossenborg.

In 1996, as in 1990, Brann were denied bronze medals in injury time of the last game, after a terrible blunder by keeper Birkir Kristinsson. Only days later, however, Brann beat PSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands to advance to the quarterfinals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, thanks to world-class goalkeeping by the same Birkir Kristinsson. This was the second time a Norwegian team had qualified for the last eight in Europe. In the quarterfinals, Brann first drew 1–1 at home against Liverpool, before losing the away match 3–0 and thus being knocked out. The 1997 season saw Brann finish as runner-up in the league, their first finish in the top 3 since 1976. Due to Rosenborg&#x27;s dominance of Norwegian football at the time a silver medal was given high apprecation.

In 1998, as in 1995, Brann found themselves at the bottom of the table halfway through the season. Kjell Tennfjord was replaced by Harald Aabrekk as head coach, and a host of quality players were purchased. This saved Brann from relegation, but combined with the construction of a new stand on Brann Stadion it also caused significant financial issues for the club. Brann faced German giants Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, where they won a strong 2–0 victory at home in the first leg, only to concede four goals in the second leg and be sent home. In 1999 Brann once again faced Rosenborg in the cup final, and for their third cup final in a row saw themselves beaten by the club from Trondheim.

===2000s: First title in decades and an end to 44 years of waiting ===
Teitur Thordarson returned as manager in 2000 after the departure of Harald Aabrekk. For the second time in four seasons, Brann became runners-up, secured after defeating Molde 4–0 in the last game of the season. Thorstein Helstad became the league&#x27;s top goalscorer in 2000 and 2001.

The 2002 season was the worst season for Brann in twelve seasons. They finished third from the bottom and had to face Sandefjord in a play-off to stay in the top tier. Brann narrowly avoided relegation thanks to a 2–1 home win after the first leg had ended with a 0–0 draw. A third-place finish in the 2004 season saw Brann qualify for the newly formed and short-lived Scandinavian Royal League.

====Mons Ivar Mjelde====
In their impatient but unfruitful struggle to reclaim the glory of the 1960s, Brann over the years gained a reputation for inept leadership, unfounded enthusiasm or optimism and almost continuous internal unrest, deservedly or not. After former Brann player Mons Ivar Mjelde took over as manager in 2003, however, this image changed, as the leadership embraced continuity and down-to-earth principles. Brann were now considered one of the best-run and harmonic clubs in Norway.

====Cup title and silverware====
Being one of the biggest clubs in Norway in terms of public interest, it is generally agreed that Brann have underperformed compared to their potential at least since the mid-1970s. However, on 7 November 2004, Brann won their first title in 22 years, defeating Oslo side Lyn 4–1 in the Norwegian Cup. Bengt Sæternes scored a hat-trick within the first 35 minutes, becoming man of the match.

For most of the 2006 season Brann were top of the league by a wide margin and considered favorites to win the title. However, a poor run of form after the summer break, coupled with a correspondingly good run of form from rivals Rosenborg meant that Brann&#x27;s hopes were dashed, and in the end Rosenborg comfortably won the league.

====League title, European football and Mons Ivar Mjelde resigns====
Brann finally won the league in 2007, ending a 44-year waiting period for one of Norway&#x27;s biggest football clubs. The club did however manage to characteristically disappoint even when succeeding, causing bitter disappointment among tens of thousands of Brann supporters who had gathered in Bergen to watch the game live by losing to relegation-threatened Aalesund in the second to last round, a match where a draw would have given Brann the league title. Two days later however, Viking defeated eventual silver medalists Stabæk, securing Brann their first league championship since 1963. The same season Brann also qualified for the group stage of the UEFA Cup, and advanced from the group with a win and a draw, knocking out merited sides Club Brugge, Dinamo Zagreb and Stade Rennais on the way. Brann faced a tough test against Everton in the round of 32, losing 8–1 on aggregate.

The 2008 season was a major disappointment for all the fans hoping to repeat the success of the 2007 season. In the league Brann finished eighth, and in the cup they were eliminated in the round of 16 after being trashed in 8–0 loss away to Molde. Brann also participated in the UEFA Champions League qualifier, but were eliminated from the contest in the third qualifying round after losing 3–1 on aggregate against Marseille. After this they played against Deportivo de La Coruña in the first round of the UEFA Cup, and were eliminated on penalties after an aggregate result of 2–2. On 7 October 2008 Brann and their head coach Mons Ivar Mjelde announced that he would resign from the club at the end of the season.

Steinar Nilsen took over for Mjelde, and lead Brann to a fifth place in the league in the 2009 season.

===2010s: Rebuilding, relegation and promotion===
====Rune Skarsfjord and cup final====
The 2010 season was a poor season for Brann. On 19 May the club were surprisingly knocked out of the cup after losing 0–1 to former rivals Fyllingen, now an amateur team in the fourth tier. Head coach Steinar Nilsen resigned two days later, and was replaced by Rune Skarsfjord. Brann ended the season in 13th place, barely avoiding the relegation play-offs.

Expectations for Brann were low ahead of the 2011 season, with newspaper VG predicting that Brann would be relegated. Nonetheless, Brann opened the season strongly with victories over reigning league champion Rosenborg and Lillestrøm in the first and second rounds. Although the season did not continue quite as strongly, Brann remained a contender for a top three position in the league and the team also qualified for its 15th cup final. Brann lost the final against Aalesund, and then the last match of the league, also against Aalesund. This resulted in Brann missing out on a medal in the league and finishing 4th. The season was also marred by Brann player Carl-Erik Torp suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch against Sogndal, only narrowly surviving and having to retire from professional football afterwards. After mediocre results in 2012 and 2013, Skarsfjord resigned from the manager position at the end of the season.

====Rikard Norling and relegation====
On 3 December 2013 Swedish manager Rikard Norling signed a contract with Brann lasting until the end of the 2016 season. The signing was met with enormous optimism by fans and pundits as Norling had recently won Allsvenskan with Malmö, and most pundits predicted a finish in the top half with chances of fighting for the medals. The 2014 season however ended disastrously with relegation for the first time in 29 years. Brann had a difficult year throughout and were in the direct relegation spots for most of the season. A crucial win over Sogndal in the penultimate round lifted them to 14th place, a play-off spot, and a last round win over Haugesund ensured it, allowing Brann a chance of salvaging a berth in next year&#x27;s Tippeligaen through a qualifying match against challenger Mjøndalen who had finished third in the second tier. The first leg at home in Bergen ended in a 1–1 draw, while the second leg away ended in a 3–0 victory for Mjøndalen. This result meant that Mjøndalen were promoted at the expense of Brann who were relegated, ending the longest top tier streak in the club&#x27;s history.

Norling still had support amongst fans, with the blame mostly being put on decisions made by the club leadership and board, who resigned after the relegation was confirmed. The following season the team continued to struggle, and in the end Norling was sacked on 27 May 2015 after a 4–1 loss against Levanger left Brann 9th in the table and 9 points behind league leader Sogndal.

====Promotion and silverware====
On 29 May 2015, Lars Arne Nilsen was hired as interim manager, and for the rest of the season, Brann performed well, eventually ending on second place and ensuring promotion with two rounds left of the season. The day after the season ended, on 2 November 2015, Nilsen was given a three-year contract.

The 2016 season saw Brann collect a shock silver medal right after promotion, only losing one game at home all season in a year where most experts predicted a struggle for survival. Nilsen&#x27;s Brann side continued to perform well in 2017, eventually ending in 5th place after fighting for medals until the very end and at one point leading the league. In 2018 Brann were leading the league for large portions of the season, at certain points being 7 points clear of second place. They lost their first match of the season in round 15 when a 17-year-old Erling Haaland scored four goals in the first 21 minutes of the match. After key player Sivert Heltne Nilsen (son of manager Lars Arne Nilsen) was sold to Danish mid-table side Horsens for a relatively small sum under controversial circumstances Brann saw a collapse in form, and ended up finishing in 3rd after spending 25 consecutive rounds in the top 2 positions. Brann continued to struggle in the 2019 season, in the end finishing in a disappointing 9th place.

=== 2020s: Scandals, relegation and silverware ===
====Decline====
Ahead of the 2020 season Brann secured a prestigious short-term loan for Bundesliga keeper Ralf Fährmann, but the season was delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the German ended up playing no official matches for the club. The season finally started in June, and was played for mostly empty stadiums with only 200–600 spectators. Although he had given Brann initially good results, attendance figures had steadily dropped under Nilsen&#x27;s tenure as manager in large part due to his style of football being considered boring, risk-averse and frustrating to watch. Fan opinion of him had soured, and after a disappointing end to the past two seasons patience for his project was wearing thin. After a loss to rivals Vålerenga in round 12 saw Brann in 8th with no wins in 5 games, Nilsen departed from the club and was replaced by Kåre Ingebrigtsen, who recently had great success with Rosenborg. He was however not able to replicate this success at Brann, only collecting 1 win in his first 11 games, and Brann were suddenly in the middle of a relegation struggle. An uptick in form towards the end of the season saw Brann avoid the relegation fight and finish in 10th, but alarm bells were ringing ahead of the 2021 season.

The 2021 season was perhaps the most infamous in Brann&#x27;s history, dubbed &quot;the worst Brann year in peacetime&quot; and &quot;Brannus horribilis&quot; by local media. It included a controversial extraordinary general meeting, a season-long relegation struggle, the departure from the club of a sporting director, a manager and a squad-wide afterparty scandal.

The 2021 season was marked with controversy even in the pre-season, when the board of the club decided to replace the stadium&#x27;s natural pitch with artificial turf to great uproar among Brann supporters. The board was harshly criticised for seemingly trying to circumvent the club&#x27;s members, and an extraordinary general meeting was called. After a heated discussion the members rejected the board&#x27;s plans to install artificial turf by 130 votes to 107, ensuring Brann would keep its grass pitch. Sporting director Rune Soltvedt left the club in February after internal conflicts, leaving the club without a sporting director during the winter transfer window, with head coach Ingebrigtsen and managing director Vibeke Johannesen sharing the duties.

====Eirik Horneland takes over====
The start of the season was catastrophic, with Brann collecting no points in their first six matches. By round 14 Brann had only collected 7 points and were firmly stuck in the relegation spots. Ingebrigtsen was sacked, and his assistant coach Eirik Horneland was made interim head coach, later being given the position permanently. The summer transfer window saw newly hired sporting director Jimmi Nagel Jacobsen sign multiple signings to help save the club from relegation, including a return to the club for Sivert Heltne Nilsen, Bård Finne and Fredrik Pallesen Knudsen.

====Afterparty scandal====
In August 2021 Brann were rocked by the biggest scandal in club history. In the week leading up to the vital first game after the summer break a social gathering and dinner was held to introduce the many new signings to the squad. After the dinner several of the players went to a local bar, before 12 of them decided to bring a group of young women to the club&#x27;s stadium to continue the party after the bar closed. Throughout the night there was drinking, partying and sexual activities, including people running undressed on the stadium pitch. The players collected cell phones beforehand to prevent videos being taken, and when the last players left around 5 in the morning everything was cleaned up. Despite this local media soon became aware of the events, and published them to great outrage amongst fans and the local population, and to great ridicule from the rest of the country.

The scandal took a turn for the worse when it was revealed the police were investigating a case of sexual assault that allegedly took place during the party. One player, later revealed to be Vegard Forren, was charged with rape. This charge was later dropped on grounds of insufficient evidence. Another player was fined 10,000 NOK for biting a young woman. The players also underwent voluntary drug tests after widespread rumors concerning intake of illegal substances.

In the wake of the scandal three players left the club. Forren and Brann quickly agreed to terminate his contract. Some days later newly signed goalkeeper Mikkel Andersen terminated his contract of his own volition and returned to Denmark. The same day the veteran Brann player Kristoffer Barmen was sacked, the club accusing him of having played a central role in organizing the activities. The nine other participants were handed a written warning, and signed a public letter of apology.

====Relegation====
Just four days after the scandal became public Brann were facing fellow relegation candidates Sandefjord in a must-win game. Forren had already left the club, while Andersen and Barmen were left out of the squad. The team were met with loud booing from the fans, and banners bearing slogans like &quot;No means no&quot; and &quot;SK Skam&quot; (SK Shame). The fans were also silent in protest for the first 19 minutes and 8 seconds of the game (symbolizing the founding year of the club). Despite this Brann managed to win the crucial game 3–2 after a week where manager Horneland admitted he &quot;hadn&#x27;t thought about football for a single second&quot;. After the match the players and fans sang Bergen&#x27;s national anthem Nystemten together.

Brann saw some improvement in results in the latter half of the season, but not enough to get clear of the relegation spots. Heading into the final game of the season Brann not only needed a win against Sarpsborg, but needed 14th-placed Stabæk to not win against 13th-placed Odd who had already secured their place and had nothing to play for. Brann took a 2–0 lead early in the 2nd half by two successive goals by local talents Aune Heggebø and David Møller Wolfe, and although Sarpsborg scored a later goal Brann ended up winning 2–1. Meanwhile, Odd comfortably beat Stabæk 3–1, meaning Brann had miraculously secured a relegation play-off from what looked like certain doom.

Brann faced Jerv in the play-off final, a small team from Grimstad with no experience in the top tier, which meant Brann were considered heavy favorites. Due to the COVID restrictions the usual two-leg structure of the play-offs was abandoned in favor of a single game played on neutral ground at Intility Arena in Oslo. On the day of the match the stadium was enveloped in a thick fog, severely reducing visibility for both players, spectators and people watching on television. Brann completely dominated the game in both the first and second half, recording 33 shots to Jerv&#x27;s 5. Jerv nonetheless took an early lead with their first shot on target, and although Brann would equalise they proved unable to take the lead in spite of total domination on the pitch. 

The historically dramatic game ended 4–4, and Brann&#x27;s future was to be decided on penalties. Both teams scored their first 3 penalties, but when goalscorer Sakor had his penalty saved by Øvretveit, Jerv were handed a golden opportunity. John Olav Norheim missed his penalty however, once again leaving the two sides even. Both sides once again scored their next 4 penalties, but when Robert Taylor stepped up to take Brann&#x27;s 9th penalty, Øvretveit once again saved. Jerv&#x27;s Shuaibu Ibrahim was more secure, and with his penalty goal Jerv were promoted to the top tier for the first time in club history while Brann were once again relegated.

====Promoted to Eliteserien, women&#x27;s team and silverware====

Brann&#x27;s 2022 season in the 2nd tier was much more successful than their previous one in 2015, and they were easily promoted in the most successful 2nd tier season in Norwegian football history, only losing one game. The records for points scored, goals scored and highest average attendance in the 2nd tier were all broken. 2022 also saw Brann&#x27;s first venture into women&#x27;s football with the adoption of Sandviken&#x27;s women&#x27;s team, which was renamed to SK Brann Kvinner and later fully merged into the club.

The 2023 season once again saw Brann earn a silver medal straight after promotion. Brann challenged Bodø/Glimt for the top spot for parts of the season, but after a poor run of form in July they had to struggle against Viking and Tromsø for the silver medal, which they eventually won. Brann qualified for the delayed 2022 cup final, where they comfortably beat Lillestrøm 2–0, earning the club its first major trophy on the men&#x27;s side since 2007. This earned them a spot in the 2023–24 Conference League qualifiers, where they first beat Arouca 3–4 on aggregate, before facing the previous season&#x27;s semifinalists AZ Alkmaar in the play-offs for the group stage, where they dramatically drew 4–4 on aggregate and narrowly lost on penalties. The season also saw Brann overtaking Rosenborg and achieving the highest average attendance in the league for the first time since 2001. In the 2024 season Brann once again finished 2nd in the league, and were once again eliminated in the Conference League play-offs.

<text>Glutaraldehyde is an organic compound with the formula . The molecule consists of a five carbon chain doubly terminated with formyl (CHO) groups. It is usually used as a solution in water, and such solutions exists as a collection of hydrates, cyclic derivatives, and condensation products, several of which interconvert. Because the molecule has two aldehyde functional groups, glutaraldehyde (and its hydrates) can crosslink substances with primary amine groups, through condensation. Crosslinking can rigidify and deactivate proteins and other molecules that are critical for normal biological function, such as DNA, and so glutaraldehyde solutions are effective biocides and fixatives. It is sold under the brandnames Cidex and Glutaral. As a disinfectant, it is used to sterilize surgical instruments.

==Uses==

=== Biochemistry ===
Glutaraldehyde is used in biochemistry applications as an amine-reactive homobifunctional crosslinker and fixative. It kills cells quickly by crosslinking their proteins. It is usually employed alone or mixed with formaldehyde as the first of two fixative processes to stabilize specimens such as bacteria, plant material, and human cells. A second fixative procedure uses osmium tetroxide to crosslink and stabilize cell and organelle membrane lipids.

Another application for treatment of proteins with glutaraldehyde is the inactivation of bacterial toxins to generate toxoid vaccines, e.g., the pertussis (whooping cough) toxoid component in the Boostrix Tdap vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline.

===Material Science===

In material science glutaraldehyde application areas range from polymers to metals and biomaterials. Glutaraldehyde is commonly used as fixing agent before characterization of biomaterials for microscopy. Glutaraldehyde is a powerful crosslinking agent for many polymers containing primary amine groups. Glutaraldehdye also can be used for an interlinking agent to improve the adhesion force between two polymeric coatings. Glutaraldehyde is also used to protect against corrosion of undersea pipes.

===Medical===

====Clinical uses====

Glutaraldehyde is used as a disinfectant and medication. Usually applied as a solution, it is used to sterilize surgical instruments and other areas.

==== Dermatological uses ====
As a medication it is used to treat plantar warts. For this purpose, a 10% w/v solution is used. It dries the skin, facilitating physical removal of the wart.

Glutaraldehyde is also used in the treatment of hyperhidrosis under the control of dermatologists in people who have frequent sweating but do not respond to aluminum chloride. Glutaraldehyde solution is an effective agent to treat palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis as an alternative to tannic acid and formaldehyde.

=== Other Uses ===
==== Aquaria ====
Glutaraldehyde diluted with water is often marketed as alternative to carbon dioxide gas injection for aquarium plants, but it lacks any characteristics that promote the growth of aquatic plants, and does not raise the concentration of water it is added to . Aquarists also commonly use it in low concentrations as an algicide.

==Safety==
Side effects include skin irritation. If exposed to large amounts, nausea, headache, and shortness of breath may occur. Protective equipment is recommended when used, especially in high concentrations. Glutaraldehyde is effective against a range of microorganisms including spores. Glutaraldehyde is a dialdehyde. It works by a number of mechanisms.

As a strong sterilant, glutaraldehyde is toxic and a strong irritant. There is no strong evidence of carcinogenic activity, However, some occupations that work with this chemical have an increased risk of some cancers.

==Production and reactions==
===Production===
Glutaraldehyde is produced industrially by the catalytic oxidation of cyclopentene by hydrogen peroxide, which can be achieved in the presence of various tungstic acid-based heteropoly acid catalysts. This reaction essentially mimics ozonolysis. Alternatively it can be made by the Diels-Alder reaction of acrolein and vinyl ethers followed by hydrolysis.

===Reactions===
Like other dialdehydes, (e.g., glyoxal) and simple aldehydes (e.g., formaldehyde), glutaraldehyde hydrates in aqueous solution, forming gem-diols. These diols in turn equilibrate with cyclic hemiacetal. Monomeric glutaraldehyde polymerizes by aldol condensation and Michael reactions yielding alpha, beta-unsaturated poly-glutaraldehyde and related oligomers. This reaction occurs at alkaline pH values.

A number of mechanisms have been invoked to explain the biocidal and fixative properties of glutaraldehyde. Like many other aldehydes, it reacts with primary amines and thiol groups, which are common functional groups in proteins, nucleic acids and polymeric materials. Being bi-functional, glutaraldehyde is a crosslinker, which rigidifies macromolecular structures and shuts down their reactivity.
The aldehyde groups in glutaraldehyde are susceptible to formation of imines by reaction with the amines of lysine and nucleic acids. The derivatives from aldol condensation of pairs of glutaraldehyde also undergo imine formation.

<doc id="192072" wikidata="Q3305658" url="?curid=192072" title="Memín Pinguín">
<text>Memín Pinguín was a Mexican comic book character. He was created in 1943 by writer Yolanda Vargas Dulché. Alberto Cabrera took over drawing from 1953 until 1962, followed by Sixto Valencia Burgos.

The original series had 372 chapters printed in sepia, and it has been republished in 1952 and 1961. In 1988 it was re-edited colorized, and in 2004 was re-edited again. Valencia worked on the reissues over the years, updating the drawings (clothes, settings and backgrounds) for the re-edits. It contains comedy and soap opera elements. However, since 2008 Valencia no longer works on the comic, having departed publishing house Editorial Vid.

In addition to Mexico, &quot;Memín&quot; remains a popular magazine in the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Panama, Colombia, Nicaragua, and other countries. At its peak, it had a weekly circulation of one and a half million issues in Mexico.

==Characters==
The stories were partially based on recollection of the childhood adventures of Yolanda Vargas Dulché in the Colonia Guerrero near downtown Mexico City. The character of Memín Pinguín was inspired by Cuban children seen by the author Yolanda Vargas Dulché on her travels. &quot;Memín&quot; is an alteration of &quot;Memo&quot;, the shortened form of &quot;Guillermo&quot;, her husband&#x27;s name; &quot;Pinguín&quot; comes from &quot;pingo&quot; (roughly meaning mischievous, in an affectionate tone).

Memín is a restless boy who is not a very good student, not because of a lack of intelligence, but for not being able to pay attention (he is surprisingly good at arithmetic). He helps his mother working in the street, selling newspapers, and as a shoe shine boy. Memín reflects the life of a poor Mexican boy in Mexico City. Memín and his mother are the only Afro-Mexican characters.

Memín is accompanied in his adventures by a group of three loyal friends:
;Carlos &quot;Carlangas&quot; Arozamena: A shrewd curly-haired boy who was abandoned by his rich father and was raised by his working class mother. He likes to solve things with his fists, and rarely shows fear. He&#x27;s a tough boy with a heart of gold. He is not as intelligent as Ernestillo but he manages to get the best scores in a private school test when he moved to live with his father. He thinks his mother has an honest job until he realizes she worked as a &quot;Fichera&quot; (dancer in night clubs) and got involved in a fight that leaves his mother bullet injured and Carlangas in jail due to almost killing her aggressor. His mother lately reencounter with Carlos Arozamena Sr., and while they fail to reconcile they decide to bring Carlangas a better future sending him to live with his father, but Carlos got homesick and came back to his mother&#x27;s side. Finally his parents got married again, but not after Carlos Sr. got bankrupt and really learn to appreciate true love than things.
;Ernesto &quot;Ernestillo&quot; Vargas: The intelligent and hard working one. His mother died when he was young and has since been raised by his father, an alcoholic carpenter. Ernestillo is so poor he has no shoes. Later, with the help of Ricardo and his friends, he has better clothes and helps his father to overcome his alcoholism and an accident that almost left him without a leg. He acts as the voice of reason of the group but sometimes he is not patient enough to send a &quot;coscorrón&quot; (noogie) to Memín. He is Memín&#x27;s best friend and was involved in one of Memín&#x27;s dreams when both go to China.
;Ricardo &quot;Riquillo&quot; Arcaraz: A blond rich boy who has traveled around the world. His father decided it would be better for him to attend a public school; a self-made man, he thinks his son was being pampered too much at private schools. At first he had significant troubles fitting in, until some incidents after school led to create a bond with Memín and his friends, to the point of standing up to his mother to defend them . He learns the value of work from Memín, as well as the realities and hardships of life. For a while, he even works as a shoeshine boy with Memín. When his parents tried to get a divorce, he ran away to Guadalajara to live with his godmother, but Memín, who accompanied him, left a note to Eufrosina, leading Ricardo&#x27;s parents to them.

Other prominent characters as listed:
;Eufrosina: She is the hot-tempered but charming mother of Memín that makes a living by taking in washing the clothes of her neighbors. She also likes to cook, specially the &quot;tortas de miel&quot; (bread with honey) that Memín loves to eat. However, when she got angry to Memín punishes him by hitting his butt with a table with a nail attached. Her main stories were concerned to adopt a pretty girl that was abandoned in a park while Memín was playing even the poverty of the family; later she tries to get a job in New York City but not without having Memín lost and then confronting Memín homesick attitude after an unfortunate job in a mansion. A more memorable story puts her sick and with the need of a kidney transplant after suffering because of Memín cheating his notes in school. 
;Trifon: An obese boy that comes from the North of Mexico. In his first appearance is picked on by Memín because of his obesity to the point to have Memín jumping over his stomach. Later, he got severely ill while Memín decided to not take Communion; however Memín is not able to make Trifon realize he is acting bad even after slapping him in the face. Later, Memín got really repentant when he learns about Trifon&#x27;s illness and got scared when he did not find him after his Communion, just to know that he is cured. Lately is a prominent character in the Memín&#x27;s adventure in Monterrey and Texas, because he helps Memín and his friends to get some hospitality from his aunt Canuta. In a later adventure, he dies bringing an uproar among fans and pushing the creator to avoid killing another characters.
;Professor Romero: The teacher of Memín&#x27;s class, he is a very comprehensive teacher while also very strict, going to the extreme to punish Memín sometimes due to his laziness. However, he manages to help his students to help Ernestillo and his father to overcome the alcoholic problems of Ernestillo&#x27;s father. Some stories later, Memín was punished to study with the lower grade kids and while doing this makes a mischief that pushes the teacher really angry so she went to Professor Romero&#x27;s classroom to complain about it; however Romero stands for Memín and, in the process, the teachers fell in love and they are married later. During their honeymoon they find Memín&#x27;s gang lost after they follow a fake treasure map and manages to bring them back to their parents. Later adventures were involved around Memín&#x27;s incapability to study.
Although &quot;Memín&quot; is a comedy comic, it resembles soap operas in that the comic&#x27;s story is a continuous one. Every week, the newest publication of &quot;Memín&quot; begins where the last publication had left off. In addition, because of the elements involved in the comic magazine&#x27;s story, such as poverty, parental abandonment, death and alcoholism, often there are dramatic moments in the magazine as well.

Based on the popularity of Memín, Yolanda and her husband Don Guillermo de la Parra were able to found Editorial Vid, a comics publishing company that eventually published hundreds of titles of Mexican comics, some of them written by Yolanda and her husband. Some of these titles also had stories related to black people, such as &quot;Rarotonga&quot;, &quot;Majestad Negra&quot;, and &quot;Carne de Ébano&quot;, but only Memín was set in Mexico.

==Racial issues==
While Memín suffers a degree of racist taunting, especially in the first issues, the characters mocking him are depicted as either cruel or ignorant. As the story progresses, his race becomes less of an issue.

In an earlier story, Memín and his friends go to Ricardo&#x27;s house after the then spoiled kid decides to make them to take a bath because of a mud fight they were involved. While bathing Memín forgets a soap bar and walked outside the bathroom without caring to dress, just to walk in front of Ricardo&#x27;s mother that, scared, began to scream that a chimp was in her house, Memín, not catching the offense, really thinks that there is a chimp in the house and both began running scared, the woman from Memín, himself from the supposed chimp.

In one famous issue, Memín, having read that Cleopatra VII of Egypt took milk baths to lighten her skin, tries the same treatment. His mother weeps with sorrow that her son would want to change his skin color. A repentant Memín decides to be proud of his race and color to honor his good mother.

In another, Memín decides not to receive Communion at his church, after a cruel boy tells him blacks are not allowed in Heaven, pointing to the lack of black angels in religious paintings as proof (this was inspired by a popular song &quot;Angelitos negros&quot; that asked the same question and a popular Mexican motion picture of 1948 of the same name). Memín reasons that, since he is going to Hell anyway, he can get away with any mischief he wants. This prompted some Roman Catholic priests to boycott the magazine. After sales plummeted in response to the boycott, an issue was published in which Memín&#x27;s friends, with the aid of the church priest, paint one of the angels in the church black; Memín returns to church and dreams of becoming an angel.

In yet another adventure called &quot;Líos Gordos&quot; Memín and his friends travel to Texas to play soccer. They go for a chocolate milkshake, but the place refuses service to Memín, because it doesn&#x27;t serve &quot;Negroes&quot;. His friends stand up for him, get into a fight, and end up in jail.

In a later adventure, Memín and Eufrosina decide to work in New York City but Memín gets lost in the process and begins working for a Mexican family where a blind girl begins to bring affection to her new employee. She thinks that he is blond and white because of his cheerful attitude (inspired by Marianela from Benito Perez Galdos). Later, Memín meets her cousin, a spoiled kid who he begins to have some fights. Finally, the girl is cured of her condition, but Memín, scared to be seen by the girl, decides to retire from the house while the girl misses her cousin with Memín. Some days later, she frees Memín and his mother from jail and reveals that she learned about the truth and explains all the masquerade to Eufrosina&#x27;s dismay.

Finally, Memín and his friends went along a millionaire to Africa, where the most racial details were put in hot place, first Memín got a motherly friendship with a female gorilla, that later tends to be very useful for the kids to save the millionaire to be killed by his ambitious son. Later, they got trapped by cannibals that thought that Memín is a gift from the gods because of his bald condition and they named him King, just to be captured by slave traders (that freed Memín&#x27;s friends in the process) and, while Memín was suffering in the ship, his friends finally freed him not without having a very angry Memín punching everyone (including his friends) due to their bad attitude over black people.

==Memín in popular culture==
As a result of the character&#x27;s fame, Memín has appeared in other magazines. In 1965, he gave a lengthy interview for the magazine &quot;Contenido&quot;, where he appeared in a tuxedo. In addition, he was considered one of the most famous members of the Mexican Scout Association, and included in the cover of their magazine in June 1995 to coincide with the publication of the &quot;History of Mexican Comics&quot; stamps by the Mexican Postal Service.

==Controversy==
&quot;Memín&quot; was criticized on its first runs (1960–1970), but the critics were more concerned with his popularity, since intellectuals of that time had a very low opinion of comics in general. The average age of the comic reader in Mexico was higher than in the United States, about 18 instead of 13, so some argue the content of comics had a very strong influence on Mexican society. &quot;Memín&quot; was read mostly by poor and middle-class Mexicans. Some of the critics touch upon the racial aspects, but this topic was mostly ignored. Critics were more concerned with the stereotypical treatment of certain social themes and the values the stories typically reflect, which more or less echo the ideals of a Catholic middle class. Yolanda was very sensitive to critics, since they reflect heavily on sales. As Harold Hinds comments in his book &quot;Not just for children&quot;, the study of these comics is important to understand Mexican society.

In June 2005, as part of a &quot;History of Mexican Comics&quot; series, the Mexican Postal Service (SEPOMEX) issued a series of postage stamps featuring the character of Memín. The stamps were deemed offensive by a number of African American community groups and politicians in the United States, including Jesse Jackson, prompting the Mexican government to assert that Memín had done a lot to oppose racism and that the stereotypical Warner Brothers&#x27; character Speedy Gonzales was never interpreted as offensive in Mexico. LULAC and NCLR, Hispanic Americans civil rights organizations, also issued statements calling the stamps racist.

The charges of racism stem from the manner in which Pinguín and his mother are rendered, in the style of &quot;darky iconography&quot; (a form which, in the United States, has its roots in blackface and the American minstrel show tradition.) Early Mexican comic artists adopted this mode of depicting people of African descent which had become commonplace around the world. Memín and his mother are depicted stereotypically as the &quot;pickaninny&quot; and the &quot;mammy&quot;, respectively. The dress and attitudes of Memín&#x27;s mother are a caricature of Afro-Cuban women of the time and mirror Afrodiasporic clothing in various Latin American countries.

Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs Luis Ernesto Derbez declared to the press that &quot;it is a total lack of knowledge of our culture; it looks to me that it is a total lack of respect to our culture that some people are making an issue out of this which does not resemble the reality.&quot;

According to Mexican author Enrique Krauze, the difference of reactions to Memín Pinguín in the United States and Mexico stem from each nations history. Krauze claimed that due to American history being more fraught with racism than Mexico, including racist legislation such as the Jim Crow laws, Americans will perceive things in a far more racialized manner than Mexicans. He elaborated on this point by saying that although Mexico had racial issues of its own, acts such as the earlier abolition of slavery in Mexico caused Mexicans to view the comics from a less racialized perspective than the American populace.

The criticism from United States officials was not only ridiculed by public opinion leaders in Mexico and by most of the Mexican population, but it also spurred interest in the stamps: from the day they were criticized, they were offered in Internet auction sites for several times their face value, and Mexican collectors bought the full edition of 750,000 copies in a few days. Sales of the magazine increased, and the publisher decided to relaunch the series from the first issue alongside the current printing. Mexican intellectuals both from right and left have denounced this criticism as an attack on Mexico, and political magazines like &quot;Proceso&quot; have questioned the chain of events that led to the criticism, making this criticism, a political issue against México.

In 2008, after complaints from an African-American shopper regarding what one news organization reported to be Memín&#x27;s simian-like appearance and his &quot;Aunt Jemima-like mother,&quot; all Memín periodicals were pulled from Wal-Mart stores in Texas. This came after the latest issue titled &quot;Memín para presidente&quot; (&quot;Memín for President&quot;) was being sold at locations with a large Hispanic population.

In 2011, in one of the Mexican reprints of the comic, there is a picture involving Memín Pinguín walking alongside Michelle Obama. Memín says &quot;and this job is one that African-Americans really want to do&quot; poking fun on the 2005 comment of President Fox, but probably also telling the irony over the fact that an African-American was then the president of the United States (and that the latest issue of Memín Pinguín in USA was called Memín for president).

The Estates General of 1789, &quot;(Etats Généraux)&quot; made up of representatives of the three estates, which had not been convened since 1614, met on 5 May 1789. The Estates-General reached a deadlock in its deliberations by 6 May. The representatives of the Third Estate attempted to make the whole body more effective and so met separately from 11 May as the &quot;Communes&quot;. On 12 June, the &quot;Communes&quot; invited the other Estates to join them: some members of the First Estate did so the following day. On 17 June 1789, the &quot;Communes&quot; approved made by Sieyès that declared themselves the National Assembly by a vote of 490 to 90. The Third Estate now believed themselves to be a legitimate authority equal to that of the King. Elements of the First Estate, primarily parish priests who were closer in wealth to the Third Estate compared to the bishops who were closer in wealth to the Second Estate, joined the assembly from 13 June onwards and, on 19 June, the whole of the clergy voted to join the National Assembly. A legislative and a political agenda unfolded.

===Tennis Court Oath===
There were soon attempts by King Louis XVI and the Second Estate to prevent the delegates from meeting, as well as misunderstandings on both sides about each other&#x27;s intentions. Locked out of its chamber, the new assembly, led by its president Jean-Sylvain Bailly, was forced to relocate to a nearby tennis court, on 20 June; there, it swore the Tennis Court Oath, &quot;(Le serment du Jeu de Paume)&quot; promising &quot;not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established and consolidated upon solid foundations.&quot; Failing to disperse the delegates, Louis started to recognize their validity on 27 June.

The Assembly renamed itself the &quot;National Constituent Assembly&quot; on 9 July and began to function as a governing body and a constitution-drafter. However, it is common to refer to the body even after then as the &quot;National Assembly&quot; or the &quot;Constituent Assembly&quot;.

==Structure in summer 1789==

Following the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, the National Constituent Assembly became the effective government of France. In the words of historian François Mignet: The assembly had acquired the entire power; the corporations depended on it; the national guards obeyed it... the royal power, though existing of right, was in a measure suspended, since it was not obeyed, and the assembly had to supply its action by its own.

The number of the Estates-General increased significantly during the election period, but many deputies took their time arriving, some of them reaching Paris as late as 1791. According to Timothy Tackett, there were a total of 1,177 deputies in the Assembly by mid-July 1789. Among them, 278 belonged to the nobility, 295 to the clergy, and 604 were representatives of the Third Estate. For the entire duration of the Assembly, a total of 1,315 deputies were certified: 330 clerics, 322 nobles, and 663 deputies of the Third Estate. Tackett noted that the majority of the Second Estate had a military background, and the Third Estate was dominated by men of legal professions.

Some of the leading figures of the Assembly at this time were:
* The conservative foes of the revolution, later known as &quot;The Right&quot;:
** Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès – a forthright spokesman for aristocracy
** the abbé Jean-Sifrein Maury – a somewhat inflexible representative of the Church
* The &quot;Monarchiens&quot; (&quot;Monarchists&quot;, also called &quot;Democratic Royalists&quot;) allied with Jacques Necker, inclined toward arranging France along lines similar to the British constitution model with a House of Lords and a House of Commons:
** Pierre Victor, baron Malouet
** Trophime-Gérard, marquis de Lally-Tollendal
** Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre
** Jean Joseph Mounier
* &quot;The Left&quot; (also called &quot;National Party&quot;) was still relatively united in support of revolution and democracy, representing mainly the interests of the middle classes but strongly sympathetic to the broader range of the common people. In the early period, its most notable leaders included Honoré Mirabeau, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Jean-Sylvain Bailly (the first two of aristocratic background). Mignet also points to Adrien Duport, Antoine Pierre Joseph Marie Barnave, and Alexander Lameth as leaders among the &quot;most extreme of this party&quot; in this period, leaders in taking &quot;a more advanced position than that which the revolution had [at this time] attained.&quot; Lameth&#x27;s brother Charles also belonged to this group.
* Patriotic Society of 1789

One must add the role played by the Abbé Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, especially in regard to the proposition of legislation in this period, as the man who, for a time, managed to bridge the differences between those who wanted a constitutional monarchy and those who wished to move towards more democratic, even republican directions.

== Restoration of king ==
In the summer of 1791, the National Constituent Assembly decided that the king needed to be restored to the throne if he accepted the constitution. The decision was made after the king&#x27;s failed flight to Varennes. That decision enraged many Parisians into protesting, and one major protest devolved into the Champ de Mars Massacre, with 12 to 50 people killed by the National Guard.

==Dissolution==
After surviving the vicissitudes of a revolutionary two years, the National Constituent Assembly dissolved itself on 30 September 1791. The following day, the Constitution of 1791 went into effect, which granted power to the Legislative Assembly.

<doc id="192080" wikidata="Q57665" url="?curid=192080" title="Jens Stoltenberg">
<text>Jens Stoltenberg (; born 16 March 1959) is a Norwegian politician from the Labour Party. Since 2025, he has served as Minister of Finance in the Støre Cabinet. He has previously served as prime minister of Norway and secretary general of NATO.

Born in Oslo as the son of diplomat and politician Thorvald Stoltenberg and politician Karin Stoltenberg (), Stoltenberg attended Oslo Waldorf School and Oslo Cathedral School before graduating with a degree in economics from the University of Oslo in 1987. During his studies, he worked as a journalist, and led Labour&#x27;s youth wing from 1985 to 1989.

Stoltenberg started his career in government as a state secretary in the Ministry of the Environment in 1990 and was elected to the Storting in 1993. He served as Minister of Industry and Energy from 1993 to 1996 and Minister of Finance from 1996 to 1997. He was prime minister from 2000 to 2001, was leader of the Labour Party from 2002 to 2014, and served as prime minister for a second time from 2005 to 2013. The following year, he was named as the 13th secretary general of NATO, and his term was subsequently extended four times by the NATO heads of state and government.

Stoltenberg has been described as a cautious politician, belonging to the right wing of social democracy. When he became prime minister in 2000, he was portrayed as the &quot;Norwegian Tony Blair&quot;, and his policies were inspired by Blair&#x27;s New Labour agenda. As the second longest-serving high-ranking official in NATO history, Stoltenberg has worked to expand the alliance into Eastern Europe and to strengthen the alliance&#x27;s military capabilities in response to the Russo-Ukrainian War, and his tenure coincided with the largest increase in NATO defense spending since the Cold War.

On 4 February 2025, after the Centre Party withdrew from the Støre Cabinet, Stoltenberg returned to Norwegian politics by being appointed as the new Minister of Finance, succeeding Trygve Slagsvold Vedum.

== Early life ==
Stoltenberg was born 16 March 1959 in Oslo, into the Norwegian Stoltenberg family, the family name derived from Stoltenberg in Schleswig-Holstein where a German ancestor once lived. Jens&#x27;s father, Thorvald Stoltenberg (1931–2018), was a prominent Labour party politician and diplomat who served as an ambassador, as defence minister and as foreign minister. His mother, Karin Stoltenberg (née Heiberg; 1931–2012), was a geneticist who served as state secretary in multiple governments during the 1980s. Marianne Heiberg, married to former foreign minister Johan Jørgen Holst, was his maternal aunt. Jens lived in SFR Yugoslavia from 1961 to 1964 while his father worked at the Norwegian embassy.

Stoltenberg attended primary school at Oslo Waldorf School, and upper secondary school at Oslo Cathedral School. He served his mandatory military service with the Army&#x27;s Infantry Training Centre at Evjemoen in Aust-Agder. After leaving the army, Stoltenberg enrolled at the University of Oslo, graduating in 1987 with the cand.oecon. degree in economics. The title of his thesis was &quot;Makroøkonomisk planlegging under usikkerhet. En empirisk analyse&quot; (&quot;Macroeconomic planning under uncertainty. An empirical analysis&quot;).

Stoltenberg&#x27;s first steps into politics came in his early teens, when he was influenced by his sister Camilla, who at the time was a member of the then Marxist–Leninist group Red Youth. Opposition to the Vietnam War was his triggering motivation. Following heavy bombing raids against the North Vietnamese port city of Hai Phong at the end of the Vietnam War, he participated in protest rallies targeting the United States Embassy in Oslo. On at least one occasion embassy windows were broken by stone-throwing protesters. Several of Stoltenberg&#x27;s friends were arrested by the police after these events.

== Journalistic career (1979–1990) ==
From 1979 to 1981, Stoltenberg was a journalist for &quot;Arbeiderbladet&quot;. From 1985 to 1989, he was the leader of the Workers&#x27; Youth League. From 1989 to 1990, he worked as an executive officer for Statistics Norway, Norway&#x27;s central institution for producing official statistics. He also worked part-time as an hourly paid instructor at the University of Oslo during this period. Between 1990 and 1992, he was leader of the Oslo chapter of the Labour Party.

Up to 1990, he had regular contacts with a Soviet diplomat. He ended this relationship after being informed by the Norwegian Police Security Service that his contact was a KGB agent, warning him against further contact. The code name given to Stoltenberg by the KGB was &quot;Steklov&quot;.

== Political career in Norway ==

=== Ministry for Environment and Minister for Trade and Energy (1990–1996) ===

Stoltenberg served as State Secretary in the Ministry of the Environment from 1990 to 1991. He was first elected to Parliament in 1993 for the Oslo constituency, and is a member of the Labour Party. He served as Minister of Industry from 1993 to 1996, until Brundtland resigned.

=== Minister of Finance (1996–1997) ===

In 1996, Thorbjørn Jagland became prime minister, and Stoltenberg became Minister of Finance. On 29 September 1997, Jagland resigned because of an ultimatum he had issued stating that the cabinet would resign if the party received less than 36.9% of the popular vote. Labour only received 35.0%; true to his promise, Jagland resigned as a consequence of its 36.9 ultimatum, and power was transferred to the first cabinet of Kjell Magne Bondevik. After Jagland&#x27;s resignation and while in parliamentary opposition, Stoltenberg served on the standing committee on Oil and Energy Affairs in the Storting. He became the parliamentary leader and prime minister candidate for the Labour Party in February 2000.

=== First term as Prime Minister (2000–2001) ===


In 2000, the first cabinet of Bondevik resigned following an unsuccessful motion of confidence. Stoltenberg&#x27;s first cabinet governed Norway from 17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001. Stoltenberg was the deputy leader of the Labour Party while Jagland was the party leader. Instead Jagland was given the post as Foreign Minister. Stoltenberg&#x27;s first tenure as Prime Minister (2000–2001) was controversial within his own party, being responsible for reforms and modernisation of the welfare state that included partly privatising several key state-owned services and corporations. In the parliamentary election of 10 September 2001, the party suffered one of its worst results ever, winning only 24% of the vote.

The 2001 election met with instability for the Labour Party. The Norwegian newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot; stated: &quot;We are heading for a political earthquake when the votes are counted tonight, if we believe the opinion polls.&quot; In an interview with The Associated Press Jagland stated &quot;It is unstable and unpredictable.&quot; After the election in 2001, Stoltenberg and his cabinet were forced to resign, with the Labour Party suffering from its worst election campaign results since 1924. With the 98% votes taken, the Labour Party only garnered 24%, falling from 35%. Jagland, the Labour Party leader, commented on the results saying, &quot;We will have to make a decision about whether to continue in government after we know the full results&quot;. After the election Stoltenberg said, &quot;What is clear is that this was a very bad election.&quot;

Some analysts have pointed out that one of the causes for their loss was that with only one year in power until the next election, more time was spent initiating or trying to start reforms than telling the people why they had to be done. Such reforms included selling down in state-owned companies, re-organisation of health care and public hospitals and changes in sick pay. The changes made from the 2001 election to the 2005 election were described by Norwegian newspaper &quot;VG&quot; as an &quot;extreme makeover&quot;.

==== Party leader election ====
The bad election result in 2001 was quickly followed by a leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party&#x27;s congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to say whether he would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators as a sign that he probably would seek the leadership position. In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been briefly hospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave, said that he would not seek reelection as leader. In November 2002, Stoltenberg was unanimously elected new leader at the party&#x27;s congress.

=== Second term as Prime Minister (2005–2013) ===
Stoltenberg&#x27;s second cabinet governed Norway from 17 October 2005 to 16 October 2013. The 2005 parliamentary election saw a vast improvement for Labour, and the party gained a majority in parliament together with the other &quot;Red-Green&quot; parties, the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party. This paved the way for a historic first in Norway, with Labour joining in a coalition government, the Red-Green Coalition, after a coalition deal with Stoltenberg was struck. Since the government&#x27;s formation, key political issues such as Norwegian military participation in the war in Afghanistan, petroleum activities in the Barents Sea, LGBT rights, immigration and the quality of standard education were greatly debated by the public. Following Stoltenberg&#x27;s re-election in 2009, he worked on the Norwegian response to the ongoing global recession and championed for environmentalist policies through private and corporate taxation.
A marine border dispute with Russia in the Barents Sea since 1978 was settled when Stoltenberg and President of Russia Dimitry Medvedev signed an agreement on 27 April 2010 in Oslo. The agreement is a compromise, which divides a disputed area of around into two approximately equally sized parts. However, the agreement still needs ratification by the State Duma and the Parliament of Norway in order to be implemented. Whereas Norway had previously insisted on a border in accordance with the equidistance principle, which is recognized in international law, specifically the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea Article 15 and the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone Article 6, Russia invoked a Stalin-era decree of the Soviet Union from 1926, which was not recognised by any other country. The new agreement replaced a controversial temporary agreement negotiated by Jens Evensen and Arne Treholt, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy and who aided the Soviet Union in the negotiations. Most of the disputed area was within what would normally be considered Norwegian according to the relevant international treaties.

As Prime Minister, Stoltenberg worked for a constructive relationship with Russia through dialogue and cooperation underpinned by NATO&#x27;s deterrence and defence capabilities. During his tenure, he also emphasised the need to focus on security challenges close to Allied territory.

==== 22 July 2011 terrorist attacks ====

On 22 July 2011, a far-right extremist committed two attacks: a bomb went off in Oslo outside the government building which houses the prime minister&#x27;s office, killing eight people while wounding others. About an hour later, he shot 69 people at Utøya, an island forty-five minutes away where the ruling Labour Party was holding its annual youth camp. The PM was due for a visit at the youth camp the next day, and was in his residence preparing his speech at the time of the Oslo explosion.

On Sunday 24 July, Stoltenberg spoke at the church service in the Oslo Cathedral. He named two of the victims at Utøya, Monica Bøsei, who was the camp&#x27;s leader, and Tore Eikeland, who was the leader of the youth chapter in Hordaland. He again vowed to work for more democracy, openness, and humanity, but without naïveté.
He also said that &quot;No one has said it better than the AUF girl who was interviewed by CNN: &quot;If one man can show so much hate, think how much love we could show, standing together.&quot;&quot;
The AUF girl mentioned is Stine Renate Håheim interviewed by CNN&#x27;s Richard Quest on 23 July 2011. Håheim again quoted her friend Helle Gannestad, who had tweeted this from home, watching events unfold on TV.

On 24 August 2012, 33-year-old Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik was found guilty by the Oslo District Court of having perpetrated by himself both terrorist attacks, the bombing of the prime minister&#x27;s office and the shooting spree on Utøya island, and was convicted to &quot;containment&quot;, a special form of prison sentence that can be extended indefinitely—with a time frame of 21 years and a minimum time of 10 years, which, in all, is the maximum penalty in Norway.

On 3 September 2012, Norwegian daily &quot;Klassekampen&quot; wrote that the Gjørv Report on the terrorist attack &quot;is the hardest verdict against a Norwegian cabinet since the Fact-Finding Commission of 1945 ensured that Johan Nygaardsvold&#x27;s political career was abruptly halted.&quot; Stoltenberg said after the report was published that he had &quot;ultimate responsibility for the preparedness in our country, a responsibility I take seriously,&quot; but said he would not resign.

==== 2013 election and defeat ====

Stoltenberg was the prime minister candidate for the Red-Green Coalition in the 2013 elections, seeking re-election for a third term.

On 9 September 2013, the coalition failed to win a majority, with 72 of the required 85 mandates, despite the Labour Party remaining the largest party in Norway with 31%. After Erna Solberg formed her cabinet, Stoltenberg returned to the Parliament as leader of the opposition, and a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. In December 2013, he was appointed by the United Nations as a Special Envoy on Climate Change, alongside the former Ghanaian president John Kufuor.

=== Policies as Prime Minister ===
Stoltenberg has been described as a cautious politician, belonging to the right wing of social democracy.

When he became prime minister in 2000, he was portrayed as the &quot;Norwegian Tony Blair&quot;, and his policies were inspired by Blair&#x27;s New Labour agenda. Stoltenberg said he was both inspired by and wanted to learn from Blair&#x27;s policies. After election defeat in 2001, he reoriented towards a more traditional line of close cooperation with trade unions.

In security policy, Stoltenberg favours increased military spending and dialogue.

==== Defense and foreign politics ====

While Stoltenberg was prime minister, Norway&#x27;s defence spending increased steadily, with the result that Norway today is one of the NATO allies with the highest per capita defence expenditure. Stoltenberg has also been instrumental in modernising the Norwegian armed forces, and in contributing forces to various NATO operations.

Stoltenberg is a supporter of enhanced trans-Atlantic cooperation ties. He has also always been a supporter of Norwegian membership in the European Union.

Stoltenberg has criticized Israel over alleged violations of international law in the Palestinian Territories as well as in international waters, such as the Gaza flotilla raid. In 2006, Stoltenberg stated that &quot;Norway condemns Israel&#x27;s actions against Palestinians. Such collective punishment is totally unacceptable.&quot; Stoltenberg praised doctors Mads Gilbert and Erik Fosse for their humanitarian work in the Gaza Strip during the Gaza War, stating that &quot;all of Norway&quot; was behind them.

==== Financial crisis ====
Stoltenberg took an international role during the financial crisis by promoting international financial cooperation. This was among other arenas done through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a meeting in Chile 27–29 March 2009 where social democratic leaders from around the world met at a Progressive Governance Conference, just prior to the first G20 summit on the financial crisis. President Bill Clinton was among the delegates and panel that would chart a way out of the financial crisis, which included the host Michelle Bachelet, Britain&#x27;s finance minister Gordon Brown, Brazil&#x27;s President Lula da Silva and Stoltenberg. A special emergency meeting of the European Social Democratic Forum (PES) was gathered in Oslo in May 2011, on an initiative from Stoltenberg and the think tank Policy Network.

Both nationally and internationally, Stoltenberg emphasised the enormous costs the financial crisis had in the form of a high unemployment rate, and appealed for better international coordination, the balance between austerity and economic growth stimulus, active labor market measures for young people, and investments for increased innovation. Norway came out of the financial crisis with the lowest unemployment rate in Europe.

==== Environment and climate change ====
Partnering with tropical countries to preserve more of their rainforest to bind carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was a policy of the Stoltenberg government. In 2007, the government received support from the opposition to a long-term agreement to finance forest conservation with 3 billion NOK annually.

Stoltenberg through his governing advocated that international agreements with global taxes or quotas are the most effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the UN Climate Change Conference 2009, a separate proposal on the preservation of rainforests with funding from rich countries, advanced by Stoltenberg and Brazilian Pres. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2009 obtained support from among others U.S. President Barack Obama during COP15 in Copenhagen.

The summit in Copenhagen ended without a binding agreement, but before the subsequent COP16 in Cancún, Stoltenberg succeeded then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in the leadership of the committee dealing with the financing of climate actions in developing countries, also consisting of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. Under a separate forest and climate conference in Oslo in May 2010, a proposal was presented to a number of countries, with final delivery of the report in autumn 2010.

In January 2014 Jens Stoltenberg became United Nations Special Envoy on Climate Change. During the meeting there he met with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as well as UN Framework Convention director Christiana Figueres and both Achim Steiner and Helen Clark of the United Nations Development Programme.

==== Vaccines ====
Stoltenberg has been an advocate for having all the world&#x27;s children vaccinated against infectious diseases. The first speech he gave in his second term as prime minister was during Norway&#x27;s &quot;Pharmaceutics days&quot; in 2005 under the title &quot;Vaccination against poverty&quot;. Stoltenberg was a board director of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) from 2002 to 2005 and was awarded the Children&#x27;s Health Award in 2005.

An international initiative, with the UK, the Gates Foundation and Norway in the lead, that GAVI received more than $3.7 billion until 2015 for their work against child mortality. Stoltenberg was one of the key driving forces behind the initiative, and has stressed that this is an important contribution to save 9 million children from dying of the most common childhood illnesses.

In his New Year speech on 1 January 2013, Stoltenberg spoke about vaccination of the world&#x27;s children as a personal matter of the heart. &quot;Small jabs are giving millions of children the gift of life. Simple medicines can save their mothers. The fact that all these mothers&#x27; and children&#x27;s lives can be saved is—as I see it—a miracle of our time,&quot; Stoltenberg said in his speech.

=== Minister of Finance (2025–present)===
Stoltenberg made a comeback to Norwegian politics when prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre appointed him as minister of finance after coalition partner the Centre Party withdrew from government.

====Tenure====
A week into his tenure, Stoltenberg was a part of the Norwegian delegation at the 61st Munich Security Conference. He warned the United States against not allowing Ukraine to be a part of negotiations over a peace treaty with Russia over the war in Ukraine.

== United Nations Special Envoy (2013–2014) ==
In 2011, Stoltenberg received the United Nations Foundation&#x27;s Champion of Global Change Award, chosen for his extraordinary effort toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals and bringing fresh ideas to global problems. In 2019, his term as Secretary General of NATO was extended for another two years. Earlier the same year, Stoltenberg had allocated 150 million Norwegian kroner of the foreign aid budget to the same foundation, which led to criticism.

In 2013, Stoltenberg served as a UN special envoy on climate change (global warming), and he chaired the UN High-Level Panel on System Wide Coherence and the High-Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing.

== NATO Secretary General (2014–2024) ==
=== 2014 ===

On 28 March 2014, NATO&#x27;s North Atlantic Council appointed Stoltenberg as designated successor of Anders Fogh Rasmussen as the 13th Secretary General of NATO and Chairman of the council, effective from 1 October 2014. The appointment had been widely expected in the media for some time, and commentators pointed out that the alliance&#x27;s policies toward Russia will be the most important issue faced by Stoltenberg. Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, took the initiative to appoint Stoltenberg as secretary-general, securing the support first of the United States, then of the United Kingdom, and then of all other member states. Norway was a founding member of NATO in 1949, and Stoltenberg is the first Norwegian to serve as secretary-general, although former Conservative Party Prime Minister Kåre Willoch was considered a strong candidate in 1988.

=== 2015 ===
In June 2015, Stoltenberg said, &quot;I believe we don&#x27;t see any immediate threat against any NATO country from the east. Our goal is still cooperation with Russia… That serves NATO and it serves Russia.&quot;

In September 2015, Czech Deputy Prime Minister Andrej Babiš criticized NATO&#x27;s lack of response to the European migrant crisis. After talks with Stoltenberg on migrant crisis issue Babiš said: &quot;NATO is not interested in refugees, though Turkey, a NATO member, is their entrance gate to Europe and smugglers operate on Turkish territory&quot;.

=== 2016 ===

Stoltenberg strongly condemned the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt and expressed full support for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan&#x27;s government. He did not condemn the 2016–present purges in Turkey. In November 2016, Stoltenberg admitted that some &quot;Turkish officers working in NATO command structures... have requested asylum in the countries where they are working.&quot;

In June 2016, Stoltenberg said it was essential to step up cooperation with Israel, since Israel had been an active alliance partner for 20 years. In June 2018, Stoltenberg told &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that NATO would not help Israel in the case of an attack by the Islamic Republic of Iran.

In 2016, Stoltenberg stated that the NATO strongly supported &quot;the UN-led political process to find a solution&quot; to the dispute over the northern part of Cyprus, which has been under illegal occupation since the Turkish invasion of 1974.

The presidency of Donald Trump was a major challenge to NATO during Stoltenberg&#x27;s time as secretary general. Trump threatened to withdraw from NATO and undermine the alliance. A 2021 study argued that Stoltenberg played a key role in preventing Trump from undermining NATO. Stoltenberg helped to change Trump&#x27;s stance on burden-sharing, as well as maintain a robust deterrence policy toward Russia.

=== 2017 ===
In August 2017 the last NATO Certification Exercise of the four multinational battlegroups in the Baltic partners was conducted. Canada leads the battlegroup in Latvia. Germany leads the battlegroup in Lithuania. The United Kingdom leads the battlegroup in Estonia. The United States leads the battlegroup in Poland. This &quot;NATO Enhanced Forward Presence&quot; was the result of the 2016 Warsaw summit and much prior planning by Stoltenberg.

In September 2017, Stoltenberg warned that Russia has used big military exercises, including Zapad 2017 exercise in Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad Oblast and Belarus, &quot;as a disguise or a precursor for aggressive military actions against their neighbours.&quot;

=== 2018 ===
In January 2018, in response to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, Stoltenberg said that Turkey is &quot;the NATO Ally which has suffered most from terrorist attacks over many years and Turkey, as all of the countries, have the right to self defence, but it is important that this is done in a proportionate and measured way.&quot;

In February 2018, Stoltenberg stated: &quot;We don&#x27;t see any threat [from Russia] against any NATO ally and therefore, I&#x27;m always careful speculating too much about hypothetical situations.&quot; Stoltenberg welcomed the 2018 Russia–United States summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Helsinki, Finland. He said NATO is not trying to isolate Russia.

At the July 2018 Brussels Summit, the Alliance reconfirmed its commitment to preserving the credibility, coherence and resilience of the deterrence and defense posture, including by increasing its responsiveness, heightening readiness and improving reinforcement. In practical terms, NATO adopted political decisions with regard to: having, by 2020, 30 battalions, 30 air squadrons and 30 naval combat vessels ready to use within 30 days.

=== 2019 ===
In March 2019, Stoltenberg stated that &quot;Georgia will become a member of NATO&quot;.

In April 2019, Stoltenberg warned in a joint session of the U.S. Congress of the threat posed by Russia. In May 2019, Stoltenberg hailed Turkey&#x27;s contribution to NATO. He said: &quot;Turkey joined the Alliance in 1952, and it continues to be a highly valued member of our family of nations. As secretary-general, I greatly appreciate all that Turkey does for our Alliance.&quot;

In August 2019, Stoltenberg warned that NATO needs to &quot;address the rise of China&quot;, by closely cooperating with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. In June 2020, Stoltenberg urged like-minded nations to stand up to China&#x27;s &quot;bullying and coercion&quot;.

Stoltenberg &quot;strongly condemned&quot; the 2019 Abqaiq–Khurais attack on key Saudi Arabia&#x27;s oil facilities and accused Iran of &quot;supporting different terrorist groups and being responsible for destabilising the whole region.&quot;

In October 2019, Turkey invaded the Kurdish areas in Syria. Stoltenberg said that Turkey has &quot;legitimate security concerns&quot; during press conference with Turkish FM Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.

In December 2019, Stoltenberg told journalists in Brussels that &quot;Since 2016, Canada and European allies have added $130 billion more to the defense budgets, and this number will increase to 400 billion U.S. dollars by 2024. This is unprecedented. This is making NATO stronger.&quot;

=== 2020 ===

The U.S. military&#x27;s 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, which killed the high-level Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, brought strong reactions from around the world. Stoltenberg said, following a meeting on 6January, &quot;all members of the Atlantic alliance stood behind the United States in the Middle East&quot; and that &quot;Iran must refrain from further violence and provocations.&quot;

On 14 February Stoltenberg opened the Munich Security Conference. Amongst the topics he chose to address were Donald Trump&#x27;s call for the European allies to contribute more funds to the common military good, the situation in Afghanistan which he promised not to leave, and the desire of Russia to reimagine the world in terms of the spheres of influence of the post-war years of the 20th century. In a thinly-veiled reference to Chinese leadership in the 5G telecoms sector, he said that &quot;Keeping our societies open, free and resilient must be part of our response... We should not be tempted to trade short term economic benefits for longer-term challenges to our security.&quot; Earlier in the day, Stoltenberg had dealt with the partnership issue, and listed New Zealand, Australia, Finland, Sweden, Ukraine and Georgia as such, saying &quot;We support them, but they also support us. Many partners contribute to NATO missions and operations, for instance in Afghanistan or Iraq.&quot;

There is a long-standing dispute between Turkey and Greece in the Aegean Sea. The disagreement flared in August. The same month Stoltenberg said that &quot;Both Greece and Turkey are two valued allies and both contribute to our shared security. There are some disagreements and I welcome that there are bilateral contacts trying to address these differences,&quot; adding that NATO is not a part of these bilateral talks.

In October 2020, Stoltenberg called for an immediate end to the fighting over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, an enclave that belongs to Azerbaijan under international law but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.

=== 2021 ===

On 19 February 2021 Stoltenberg addressed the Munich Security Conference via teleconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic with largely anodyne remarks.

On 13 April Stoltenberg called on Russia to halt its buildup of forces near the border with Ukraine. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu said that Russia has deployed troops to its western borders for &quot;combat training exercises&quot; in response to NATO &quot;military activities that threaten Russia&quot;. Defender-Europe 21, one of the largest NATO-led military exercises in Europe in decades, began in mid-March 2021 and lasted until June 2021. It included &quot;nearly simultaneous operations across more than 30 training areas&quot; in Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania and other countries.

On 14 April 2021, Stoltenberg said the alliance has agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May. Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan Armed Forces. According to a U.S. intelligence report, the Afghan government would likely collapse within six months after NATO completes its withdrawal from the country. On 7 June 2021, Stoltenberg said that &quot;we have been able to build, train Afghan security forces so they are now responsible for security in their own country.&quot; By 15 August 2021, Taliban militants controlled the vast majority of Afghanistan and had encircled the capital city of Kabul. Stoltenberg said that &quot;it was a surprise, the speed of the collapse and how quickly that happened.&quot;

Stoltenberg attended the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, and specified that the fight against climate change also is something the military could participate in. He also expressed that militaries should work with operating both fossil and environmentally friendly ones.

On 30 November Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that an expansion of NATO&#x27;s presence in Ukraine, especially the deployment of any long-range missiles capable of striking Moscow or missile defence systems similar to those in Romania and Poland, would be a &quot;red line&quot; issue for the Kremlin. Putin argued that these missile-defense systems may be converted into launchers of offensive Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles. He said that &quot;In a dialogue with the United States and its allies, we will insist on working out specific agreements that would exclude any further NATO moves eastward and the deployment of weapons systems that threaten us in close vicinity to Russian territory.&quot; Stoltenberg replied that &quot;It&#x27;s only Ukraine and 30 NATO allies that decide when Ukraine is ready to join NATO. Russia has no veto, Russia has no say, and Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors.&quot;

=== 2022 ===
On 14 January Stoltenberg condemned the 2022 Ukraine cyberattack. He stated that NATOs day experts in Brussels has exchanged information with Ukraine, and that experts from the alliance would be assisting Ukrainian authorities with the matter. He added: &quot;In the coming days, NATO and Ukraine will sign an agreement on enhanced cooperation on data security, including Ukraine&#x27;s access to NATO&#x27;s malware sharing platform&quot;.

On 19 February at the Munich Security Conference Stoltenberg remarked that despite NATO&#x27;s &quot;strong diplomatic efforts to find a political solution [to the Russo-Ukrainian war]... we have seen no sign of withdrawal or de-escalation so far. On the contrary, Russia&#x27;s build-up continues.&quot; He said &quot;we have made written proposals to the Putin administration to reduce risks and increase transparency of military activities, address space and cyber threats, and engage on arms control, including on nuclear weapons and missiles... [Putin] is attempting to roll back history. And recreate [the] spheres of influence. [He] wants to limit NATO&#x27;s right to collective defence... and demands that we should remove all our forces and infrastructure from the countries that joined NATO after the fall of the Berlin Wall... wants to deny sovereign countries the right to choose their own path. And their own security arrangements. For Ukraine – but also for other countries, such as Finland and Sweden. And for the first time, we now see Beijing joining Moscow in calling on NATO to stop admitting new members. It is an attempt to control the fate of free nations. To rewrite the international rulebook. And impose their own authoritarian models of governance.&quot; On the dais with him was Ursula von der Leyen. Together they proceeded to give an interview to the witness audience.On 21 February 2022, Stoltenberg condemned Russia&#x27;s diplomatic recognition of two self-proclaimed separatist republics in Donbas.

On 4 March 2022, Stoltenberg said NATO would not establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He said, &quot;we are not part of this conflict, and we have a responsibility to ensure that it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine, because that would be even more devastating and more dangerous.&quot;

On 8 March 2022, Stoltenberg warned that if there is any Russia&#x27;s attack &quot;against any NATO country, NATO territory, that will trigger Article 5&quot; of the North Atlantic Treaty.

On 23 March 2022, Stoltenberg accused China of providing political support to Russia, &quot;including by spreading blatant lies and misinformation, and expressed concern that &quot;China could provide material support for the Russian invasion&quot;.

On 28 March the establishment of four more multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia was announced, although the Slovak battlegroup had already been announced on 27 February. This brings the total number of multinational battlegroups to eight, and Stoltenberg said ahead of an extraordinary NATO summit scheduled for March 24 in Brussels that &quot;we will have eight multinational NATO battle groups all along the Eastern flank from the Baltic to the Black Sea&quot;. The Baltic Sea is guarded by the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence, to which the four more would be added. A multinational brigade headquarters exists in Craiova, Romania and this seems to be the distribution point of the extra four battlegroups. The summit statements by Biden and NATO were somewhat controversial.

=== Accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO ===
In May 2022 Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden would be welcomed &quot;with open arms&quot; to NATO if they apply for membership to the alliance. While most current NATO members responded positively to the applications, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan voiced his opposition, accusing both Finland and Sweden of tolerating Kurdish militant groups PKK and the YPG, which Turkey classifies as terrorist organizations, and followers of Fethullah Gülen, whom Turkey accuses of orchestrating a failed 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt. Stoltenberg said that Turkey has &quot;legitimate concerns&quot; about Finland and Sweden joining the alliance.

In June, Stoltenberg warned that the war in Ukraine could last for years, saying that &quot;We must not let up in supporting Ukraine. Even if the costs are high, not only for military support, also because of rising energy and food prices.&quot;

On 30 November at the Bucharest meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers, were invited their counterparts from Moldova, Bosnia and Georgia, as well as Finland and Sweden. In his closing press conference Stoltenberg said that NATO expressed its solidarity with all three partners and also that &quot;if there is one lesson learned from Ukraine it is that we need to support them now. The more support we are able to provide to these countries. The more support we are able to provide to these countries... under Russian pressure and influence in different ways... it is much better to support them now than when we have seen developments going in absolutely the wrong direction as we saw with the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year.&quot;

In December, he said in an interview that &quot;there is no doubt that a full-fledged&quot; war between Russia and NATO is a &quot;possibility&quot;. Stoltenberg said that Putin is planning a long war in Ukraine and is ready to launch new offensives.

=== 2023 ===

Following the 2023 Chinese balloon incident between 28 January and 4 February, Stoltenberg said the incident said the balloon &quot;confirms a pattern of Chinese behavior where we see that China has invested heavily in new capabilities, including different types of surveillance and intelligence platforms&quot;, and that it presents security challenges for the members of NATO.

On 12 February, a NATO spokesperson said Stoltenberg had no intention of seeking a fourth extension of his term as NATO secretary-general, after the German newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; reported member states wanted him to stay on while the Russo-Ukrainian War continues.
On 13 February, Stoltenberg said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is &quot;sending thousands and thousands of more troops, accepting a very high rate of casualty, taking big losses, but putting pressure on the Ukrainians. What Russia lacks in quality, they try to compensate in quantity.&quot; He said that President Putin and the decision makers in Moscow are the only ones responsible for the Russo-Ukrainian War and it is necessary for NATO member countries to continue providing military aid to Ukraine.

On 14 June, Stoltenberg expressed support for Ukraine&#x27;s counter-offensive against Russia to recapture the occupied territories of Ukraine and called on Western countries to send more weapons to the Ukrainian armed forces.

On 4 July, Stoltenberg was confirmed to receive a fourth extension of his mandate as NATO Secretary General to 1 October 2024, which would make his tenure as Secretary General at least a decade long.

In September 2023, Stoltenberg warned that we &quot;must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine&quot;, saying that &quot;if President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians stop fighting, their country will no longer exist.&quot;

In October 2023, Stoltenberg condemned Hamas&#x27; actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense. Stoltenberg warned Iran and Hezbollah not to get involved in Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas.

=== 2024 ===

In February 2024, Stoltenberg warned that NATO member states have to prepare for a confrontation with Russia &quot;that could last decades&quot;. He said that the best defense tools against Russia are an increase in arms supplies to Ukraine and an increase in NATO&#x27;s military capabilities.

In February, Stoltenberg criticized Donald Trump&#x27;s statement that he would &quot;encourage&quot; Russia to attack NATO member countries that don&#x27;t pay their &quot;fair share&quot; of defense funding, stating that any attack on the military alliance would be met with a &quot;united and forceful response&quot;.In May, Stoltenberg called on NATO member states to allow Ukraine to use Western-supplied weapons to strike targets inside Russia. Responding to Stoltenberg&#x27;s statement, Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto stated that it is &quot;wrong to increase tension&quot; in an already &quot;dramatic&quot; situation and emphasised the need to &quot;leave open the possibility of negotiating an immediate truce and initiating peace talks in the coming months.&quot;

Asked about China&#x27;s military aid to Russia, Stoltenberg said that &quot;Russia would not have been able to conduct the war of aggression against Ukraine without the support from China.&quot; He warned that &quot;China cannot have it both ways. They cannot continue to have normal trade relationships with countries in Europe and at the same time fuel the biggest war we have seen in Europe since the Second World War.&quot;
On 9 July 2024, Stoltenberg was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, from United States President Joe Biden for his services to NATO during the Russo-Ukrainian war. This award was given at the NATO Summit in Washington, DC.

On 30 July 2024, King Felipe VI of Spain appointed Stoltenberg Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Civil Merit.

In an interview in September 2024, Stoltenberg was asked &quot;What could have been done differently, what should have been done, to prevent Russia from going to war against Ukraine?&quot;

He answered that he regrets that NATO allies and NATO itself did not do more to strengthen Ukraine before Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine began. Potentially, the threshold for Russia to attack would have been higher if Ukraine had been militarily stronger. The USA, Canada and the UK trained Ukrainian soldiers in a training center in Ukraine, but NATO did not. NATO could have given much more training and equipment.

On 18 June, it was announced Hungary and Slovakia had agreed to allow outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte to succeed Stoltenberg as Secretary General. He was officially selected by the North Atlantic Council on 26 June, and succeeded Stoltenberg on 1 October.

== Post-NATO career ==
=== Nomination for governorship of the Norges Bank ===
In December 2021, it was reported that he sought the governorship of Norges Bank, Norway&#x27;s central bank.

It was speculated that Stoltenberg would be nominated as Governor of the Norges Bank, which sources told &quot;Dagens Næringsliv&quot; in November 2021, said he would accept if he was nominated for the position. Stoltenberg&#x27;s press advisor, Sissel Kruse Larsen, told Dagens Næringsliv that it was still too early to say what Stoltenberg would do once he returns home to Norway. Stoltenberg confirmed on 14 December that he had applied for the position, and specified that he had told the Ministry of Finance that he could not ascend to the position before his term as NATO Secretary-General had expired on 1 October 2022.

His nomination was controversial prior to being officially announced, due to his links to the Labour Party, friendship with Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and concerns for the independence of the central bank. His pre-nomination was opposed by all opposition parties, with support only coming from the government parties and the Christian Democratic Party.

His appointment was officially announced on 4 February 2022. However, after a NATO summit in March 2022 concerning the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Stoltenberg accepted a renewed term of one year to continue as NATO secretary-general and thereby resigned as incoming central bank governor. Acting Governor Ida Wolden Bache was instead given the term that Stoltenberg was meant to take on.

=== Munich Security Conference ===
On 8 October 2024, it was announced that Stoltenberg would be the next Chairman of the Munich Security Conference and would assume his role in February 2025. However, following the collapse of the coalition between the Centre Party and the Labour Party, Stoltenberg succeeded Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of the Centre Party, as Norway&#x27;s Minister of Finance in February 2025 and subsequently stepped down from his position as chairman. He still plans to return to the Munich Security Conference after his tenure as minister.

=== Bilderberg Group ===
On November 8, 2024, Stoltenberg was appointed Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group, an annual private conference attended by political leaders, business executives, academics, and media representatives. The group, known for its off-the-record discussions on global affairs, has been a gathering place for high-profile figures in government and finance. His appointment placed him in a leadership role within the organization&#x27;s decision-making structure.

Much like his position in the Munich Security Conference, Stoltenberg also stepped down as head of the steering committee to focus entirely on his responsibilities as a minister.

=== Views on the war in Ukraine ===
Stoltenberg expressed support for the accelerated accession of Ukraine to NATO, saying, &quot;Where there is a will, there is a way to find a solution. But you need a line which defines where Article 5 is invoked, and Ukraine has to control all the territory until that border.&quot;

In December 2024, he said that Ukraine could temporarily give up territories occupied by Russia in exchange for peace.

== In popular culture ==
=== Incognito taxi driver in Norway ===
In August 2013, Stoltenberg said on his Facebook page that he had spent an afternoon working &quot;incognito&quot; as a taxi driver in Oslo. Stoltenberg said he had wanted to &quot;hear from real Norwegian voters&quot; and that &quot;taxis were one of the few places where people shared their true views.&quot; He added that, before driving the taxi, he had not driven a car in eight years. The event was videotaped in a hidden camera fashion, and released as a promotional video by the Labour party for the election campaign. It was later confirmed that 5 of the 14 customers were paid and recruited by the production company that produced the event for the Labour Party; however, none knew that they would meet Stoltenberg.

=== BBC Radio 4 – &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; ===
On 12 July 2020 Stoltenberg was the invited guest on the long running BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.
His musical choices included &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, sung by Bruce Springsteen; &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, by Leonard Cohen; and &quot;No Harm&quot;, by the duo Smerz, one of whom is his daughter Catharina.

=== In other media ===
In the crime drama &quot;22 July&quot;, which depicts the 2011 Norway attacks, he is played by actor Ola G. Furuseth.

== Controversies ==
Stoltenberg participated in protest rallies against the U.S. war in Vietnam in the 1970s. In 2011, Stoltenberg said &quot;We sang the chorus, &#x27;Singing Norway, Norway out of Nato.&#x27; It was a hit.&quot;

In 2001, Stoltenberg crashed his Labour Party-owned car into a parked car; he then left the premises without leaving a note with his name or number; the damages cost 8000 Norwegian kroner to repair.

In 2002, Stoltenberg admitted to having used hashish (cannabis) in his youth. He therefore asked the Ministry of Justice and Public Security to evaluate his impartiality in the upcoming government response to the report on drugs by the Stoltenberg Commission, headed by his father, Thorvald Stoltenberg.

In 2011 Stoltenberg got a 380,000 kroner boat as a birthday gift from the Norwegian Labour Party and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions; the givers also paid the tax for the gift which led to criticism.

== Personal life ==
Stoltenberg is married to diplomat Ingrid Schulerud and they have two children: a son, Axel Stoltenberg (born 1989) who is studying Chinese at the Shanghai Jiaotong University and daughter Anne Catharina Stoltenberg (born 1992) who is a part of Smerz, an experimental pop and electronic music duo signed to XL Recordings.

He has one living sister, Camilla, a medical researcher and administrator who is one year older than he; and one late sister, Nini, four years younger, who died in 2014. Nini was a recovering heroin addict, and the Norwegian media have covered the family&#x27;s efforts to cope with this challenge.

He prefers to spend his summer vacations at his family&#x27;s cottage on the Hvaler Islands in the Oslofjord. An avid outdoorsman, he rides his bike often and during the winter season he is an active cross-country skier. In December 2011, in order to mark 100 years since Roald Amundsen reached the south pole on skis, Stoltenberg journeyed to Antarctica.

Although being portrayed as an atheist for most of his adult life, and declining membership in the formerly official Church of Norway, Stoltenberg has stated that he does not consider himself an atheist. He explained: &quot;Although I am not a member of any denomination, I do believe that there is something greater than man. Some call it God, others call it something else.

<text>Thorbjørn Jagland (né Johansen; , 5 November 1950) is a Norwegian politician from the Labour Party. He served as the secretary general of the Council of Europe from 2009 to 2019. He served as the prime minister of Norway from 1996 to 1997, as the minister of Foreign Affairs from 2000 to 2001 and as the president of the Storting from 2005 to 2009.

Jagland studied economics at the University of Oslo at introductory level, but did not graduate. He started his political career in the Workers&#x27; Youth League, which he led from 1977 to 1981. He was party secretary from 1986 to 1992 and party leader from 1992 to 2002.

Jagland&#x27;s cabinet, albeit short-lived, was marked by controversies, with two ministers being forced to withdraw following personal scandals. Jagland, who was much ridiculed in the media for his quotes and statements and frequently portrayed as incompetent, resigned following the 1997 election, as a consequence of his much ridiculed 36.9 ultimatum, even though his party won the most votes. In 2010 a group of forty prominent historians ranked Jagland as the weakest Norwegian prime minister since the end of the Second World War; two years before, his predecessor Gro Harlem Brundtland had criticized his premiership in harsh terms and described Jagland as &quot;stupid&quot;. Also his term as Foreign Minister was marked by controversies, due to his perceived lack of qualification for the office and quotes and statements that were considered inappropriate. Jagland was widely perceived to have been passed over when Jens Stoltenberg formed his second cabinet in 2005.

In 2009, Jagland was elected as the secretary-general of the Council of Europe. In 2014 he was reelected for an additional five years. His tenure as secretary-general has been controversial, and he has been accused of inaction against corruption and of servility towards Putin&#x27;s Russia. Jagland was a member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, and left in 2020; he formerly served as its chairman from 2009 to 2015.

== Early and personal life ==
Thorbjørn Jagland was born on 5 November 1950 as Thorbjørn Johansen in Drammen and is the son of a welder, Helge Th. Jagland, and a cook, Ingrid Bjerknes. According to the Norwegian daily &quot;Dagbladet&quot;, his father had additional duties as a kind of &quot;steward&quot; for his community, so when &quot;the postal service had letters&quot; or envelopes without a complete address, the mailman delivered many of them to Jagland&#x27;s home, &quot;since that was where everything happened&quot;. Jagland graduated from secondary school in 1969. Along with his twin brother Helge, Thorbjørn Jagland briefly studied economics at the University of Oslo, but was at the same time involved in politics and did not finish his studies. Jagland and his parents changed their surname from Johansen, a common surname with working class connotations, to Jagland in 1957; the Jagland name was one of the proposed &quot;new family names&quot; which imitated traditional farm names in the book &quot;2000 nye slektsnavn&quot; (&quot;2,000 new family names&quot;) by Astrid Moss; the book aimed to help members of the working class with common surnames to find more unique names.

He married journalist Hanne Grotjord in 1976. The couple has two sons, Anders (born 1978) and Henrik (born 1986). As Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Jagland resided in Strasbourg, France, but has since moved back to Norway.

Jagland has been awarded the title of Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour of France for his &quot;tireless commitment to the European continent and the universal values it represents&quot;.

==Political career==

===Early involvement, general secretary and elected party leader===
In 1966, at age 16, he joined the Lier chapter of the Workers&#x27; Youth League (AUF). Rising up rapidly through the party ranks, he was elected leader of the Workers&#x27; Youth League in Buskerud, in 1973, a position he held until 1975. That year, he was elected member of the Buskerud county council. In 1977, he became the national leader of the Workers&#x27; Youth League, a position he held until 1981. During this period, he said he wanted to bridge the gap between the youth wing and the mother party, but also expressed the need for the Workers&#x27; Youth League to have its own political platform. Important issues he supported at that time included the nationalization of the oil industry, permission to conduct petroleum test boring outside Northern Norway, and that the state should use income from the petroleum industry to nationalise domestic industry.

From 1981, he worked as a secretary for the Labour Party; he became acting general secretary in 1986 and was formally appointed to the position in 1987. In his role as secretary of the Labour party, Jagland initiated a number of measures that culminated in organisational and political reforms. The right of the Trade Unions to influence the working of the Labour Party was curtailed; periodic consultations were initiated with civil society outside the party boundaries in the formulation of the party manifesto etc. In 1986, he also became chairman of the Labour Party&#x27;s International Committee. He held both positions until 1992, when he succeeded long-time leader Gro Harlem Brundtland.

Jagland was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from Buskerud in 1993, and was re-elected on three occasions. During his first term, Jagland was a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, and also served as the fractional leader for the parliamentary group of the party. In 1995, Jagland published a book, titled &quot;Brev&quot; (&quot;Letters&quot;), &quot;Vår sårbare verden&quot; (Our vulnerable World) i 2001 and &quot;Ti teser om EU og Norge&quot; (Ten Postulates about the EU &amp; Norway) in 2003.

===Premiership===

On 23 October 1996, Gro Harlem Brundtland informed Jagland she was withdrawing from politics and leaving him as head of government. The third cabinet Brundtland resigned, prompting the party leader Jagland to form a new cabinet.

Jagland&#x27;s cabinet was short-lived with two ministers being forced to withdraw. He resigned following the 1997 election even though his party won the most votes. Jagland was widely perceived to have been passed over when Jens Stoltenberg formed his second cabinet in 2005.

Jagland launched his vision of the &quot;Norwegian House&quot; during his tenure as Prime Minister. In his speech to the Storting following his appointment, Jagland described the Norwegian House as a foundation with four pillars. The metaphor represented, &quot;the collective value creation within the ecologically sustainable society&quot;. The four pillars that hold up the house were business and labour policy; welfare policy; research and educational policy; and foreign and security policy. Jagland stated that everyone had something to contribute regarding the creation of the house; in particular he stated that the cabinet would cooperate with the opposition to reach these goals. In his speech, Jagland said that he would not deviate much from Harlem Brundtland&#x27;s policies, but that he would increase the focus on violence, abuse of alcohol and drugs, and crime, including improvement of preventative measures and the courts. He also stated that it was important to introduce information technology in all parts of the education system. As part of the construction of the Norwegian House, the cabinet also started to appoint lay councils, with expertise within their fields, that would provide them with feedback and inputs on important areas in society. Jagland stated that the purpose was to allow critical voices close access to the political decisions, and increase the number of ideas generated at a political level. Jagland stated in August 2008 that, &quot;the Norwegian House could have been better planned and prepared, but I did not have the time. I took a chance. The Labour Party was down for the count. My goal was to make a good election; and we did. We have not done so well since&quot;. Jagland said in an interview, &quot;I still get letters from people who miss the Norwegian House. It was an attempt at something new, a building project that would also inspire the activity on the side of the parties&quot;.

====Jagland&#x27;s 36.9 ultimatum and resignation====
Ahead of the 1997 parliamentary election, Jagland announced the cabinet would resign if the Labour Party received less than 36.9% of the popular vote. This was the percentage of the vote that the party had received in the 1993 election while Brundtland was still leading, which had provided them with an unclear mandate to govern. The Constitution of Norway does not require a cabinet to be formally approved by Parliament in order to serve, and a minority government that lacks concrete support from its inception may serve as long as it does not receive a vote of no confidence.

The Labour cabinet was only directly supported by its own party group, which consisted of 67 out of 165 members of Parliament. To pass legislation, the cabinet had sought support from the largest opposition parties—the Centre Party as well as Labour&#x27;s traditional adversary, the Conservative Party—on a case-by-case basis. Brundtland had already employed this ad-hoc tactic during her time as Prime Minister, describing it as &quot;slalom racing in the Storting&quot;. However, the negotiations in order to land the annual state budget in 1996 were particularly tough. According to political scientist Trond Nordby, Jagland felt that a cabinet which achieved less than 36.9% would struggle to govern.

As it turned out, Labour only received 35.0%, remaining the largest party with a small loss of seats. Jagland resigned on 29 September 1997 and power was given to the first cabinet of Kjell Magne Bondevik. This cabinet had an even weaker parliamentary basis. Erik Solheim, the leader of Socialist Left Party (SV), said that if Jagland resigned, &quot;he would go down in history as Norway&#x27;s most puzzling politician&quot;.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===
In February 2000, still reeling from the 36.9 fiasco and the growing popularity of deputy party leader Stoltenberg, Jagland withdraw as a prime minister candidate. Speaking to the national council of Labour on 10 February 2000, Jagland said &quot;If I were to continue as prime minister candidate, and especially if I should return as prime minister, the pressure that has been put against me the last three years will only continue and increase in strength.&quot; Only 35 days later, the first cabinet of Bondevik resigned following a motion of confidence. A new Labour cabinet, to be led by Jens Stoltenberg, was announced by King Harald V on 17 March 2000. Jagland was chosen for Minister of Foreign Affairs.

One of his first acts as Minister of Foreign Affairs was to visit Belgrade, three years before its collapse. Jagland wanted to improve foreign aid to Yugoslavia and try to find a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav wars. Jagland engineered financial and material support to the forces in Yugoslavia who were opposed to Slobodan Milosevic, a move that increased the popularity of the opposition to Milosevic and his eventual fall from power. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs furnished computers that helped in revealing the electoral fraud perpetrated by Milosevic. The Norwegian contribution was instrumental in the overthrow of the Milosevic government and Jagland was the first to be invited to the victory celebrations.

Jagland again made national headlines in a similar fashion to the publicity about &quot;The Norwegian House&quot; and &quot;36.9%&quot;, this time for the phrase &quot;Bongo from Congo&quot;, which Jagland used when referring to Omar Bongo, the President of Gabon, when he was visiting Norway. Jagland stated on 2 February 2001 on the nationally broadcast television show &quot;I kveld med Per Ståle&quot; on TV 2 that &quot;everybody at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs went around saying that &#x27;now you are going to meet with Bongo from Congo. The term &quot;Bongo&quot; and &quot;Congo&quot; has been seen by many as a racial slur.

Jagland visited Sri Lanka in June 2001 to try to reach a level of involvement in the Sri Lankan Civil War. After a brief visit to the capital Colombo, at the request of the Sri Lankan president Chandrika Kumaratunga, Jagland agreed to take a role in the peace process of Sri Lanka between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers.[29] 
The Labour Party did not fare well during the 2001 election. In an interview with the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, Jagland said, &quot;It is unstable and unpredictable&quot;. After the votes had been counted, Stoltenberg and his cabinet was forced to resign, suffering from its worst election campaign results since 1924.

Jagland stepped down in 2001 from his post as Foreign Minister in the wake of the collapse of the Stoltenberg government.

The leadership battle of the party didn&#x27;t end with the election, and pressure was still mounting on Jagland to give the party leader role to Stoltenberg. It was expected that Stoltenberg would contest the leader during the national congress of Labour in November 2002, and in January 2002 the two were supposed to say if they wanted role. On 15 January, Jagland collapsed in the parliament and was sent to the hospital. Later that evening, during live coverage by TV 2 Nyhetene, comedian Bård Tufte Johansen interrupted the live broadcast jumping around in a chicken costume, cackling about media&#x27;s treatment of Thorbjørn Jagland and mocking the media&#x27;s double standards. On 3 February 2002, Jagland announced that he wouldn&#x27;t seek a new term as party leader in November.

===President of the Storting===
In 2005, Jagland was reelected to a fourth term in the Norwegian Parliament. Jørgen Kosmo, the previous President of the Storting, had not stood for parliamentary re-election, and Jagland was elected to this position by the members of parliament on 10 October 2005. Jagland was elected with only one blank vote, whereas his Progress Party opponent, Carl I. Hagen, had 25 blank votes in the Storting. He later said:

Jagland told the newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot; he wanted more Norwegian soldiers sent to South Afghanistan: &quot;The Norwegian special forces will certainly be welcome throughout the winter. If NATO is demanding them, Norway should contribute&quot;. In 2007, Stoltenberg allowed Jagland to push through his plan to develop Storting as a stronger centre for current political debates, thus increasing the power of the parliamentary members on issues from the cabinet.

A UN conference against racism and discrimination in Geneva was planned for the spring of 2009. Some member states, such as Canada and Israel, had announced that they might boycott the conference because previous such conferences had given way to anti-Semitism and racism. Jagland said Norway was unlikely to undertake any boycott, but he added, &quot;The previous racism conference in Durban, South Africa, in 2001, was a festival in the criticism of Western values. We must never allow the successor conference in Geneva in April next year to be a repetition of this&quot;.

In 2009, the cabinet issued a proposal to remove the &quot;Blasphemy Paragraph&quot;, part of the criminal law that made blasphemous statements a criminal offense. There was a political consensus in parliament that the paragraph was outdated. The cabinet proposed that it instead by replaced by a &quot;Racism Paragraph&quot;, that was aimed at protecting religious groups from attacks, while retaining protection of the academic freedom of speech. All political parties in parliament, except the Centre Party, were opposed to the &quot;Racism Paragraph&quot;, but Centre-leader Liv Signe Navarsete stated that she had used her influence to make the Labour Party accept the matter. When asked about the case, Jagland responded: &quot;It will in itself be a paradox if one questions the principle that freedom of speech is subject to the party whip. Especially when it emerges that the question may have been the subject of horse-trading and attempts at a coup&quot;.

Jagland had also been critical of the lack of parliamentary control permitted by the coalition cabinet. Critics accused Jagland of attacking the Red-Green Cabinet as revenge against Stoltenberg for forcing Jagland to resign as Labour Party leader in 2002. Jagland rejected this as &quot;petty criticism&quot;. Jagland announced in September 2008 that he would not seek reelection. He said he decided, with &quot;great sadness&quot;, to leave Norwegian politics because he was applying for the position of Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.

===Nobel Committee===
On 1 January 2009, he succeeded Ole Danbolt Mjøs as the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

The Norwegian Nobel Committee is tasked with selecting candidates for award of the annual Nobel Prize for Peace in accordance with the last will and testament of Alfred Bernhard Nobel (1833-1896), the Swedish chemist and inventor of dynamite. The Norwegian Parliament selects a committee consisting of 5 persons who then choose the candidates for the prize. This committee is completely independent of the Norwegian Parliament or other institutions, domestic or foreign.

The Nobel Committee announces the winning candidate(s) on the first Friday of each October; prizes themselves are handed out on 10 December in Oslo, that date being the birthday of Alfred Nobel.

The announcement of Barack Obama as winner of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, raised a few eyebrows and Jagland had to clarify this choice on several occasions. The Nobel Committee points to the fact that it has to execute the will of Alfred Nobel, in accordance with the following text in his will:

&quot;...The whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way...the capital, invested in safe securities by my executors, shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind... and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses...The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiological or medical work by the Caroline Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm, and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not...&quot;

The justification for award to Barack Obama was anchored in the work he had done to restart the START agreements with Russia and for promotion of dialogue with the Muslim world.

The Nobel Peace Prize for 2012 was awarded to the European Union for &quot;...have for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.&quot;

The Nobel Peace Prize for 2013 was awarded to the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW for &quot;...its extensive efforts to eliminate chemical weapons&quot;.

The Nobel Peace Prize for 2014 was shared between Pakistani national Malala Yousafzai and Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi. The prize motivation states: &quot;for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education&quot;.

On 3 March 2015 Jagland was demoted by the five-person Norwegian Nobel Committee, which elected Kaci Kullmann Five as its new chair. Jagland&#x27;s demotion is without precedent in the history of the Nobel Peace Prize. After the demotion, Jagland continued to serve as an ordinary member of the committee.

In 2019 the leader of the committee asked each of the members if any of them had been in contact with Jeffrey Epstein; in 2020 Jagland changed his answer; Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Gates had a meeting with Jagland at his residence in Strasbourg in 2013, according to media in October 2020.

=== Secretary General of the Council of Europe: First term, from 2009 to 2014 ===
In 2009, Jagland was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe. Jagland was elected with 165 against 80 votes in the Parliamentary Assembly. The other candidate was former Prime Minister of Poland Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz.

Jagland has emphasized the importance of strengthening the cooperation with the European Union and regular consultations are taking place with the leaders of the EU. The process of EU accession to the European Convention was meant to be ratified by 2015, but as of July 2017, no new accession agreement had been drafted. Jagland signed an intention agreement with Commissioner Stefan Füle in April 2014, which will considerably increase the number of Joint Programmes and EU financing of projects implemented by the Council of Europe. Jagland has also taken the initiative to a Neighbourhood Policy which includes an important number of cooperation activities on the basis of Council of Europe standards with Jordan, Tunisia, Morocco and Kazakhstan.

Jagland&#x27;s has initiated regular consultations with the United Nations and these have since become institutionalised within the Council of Europe.

In 2012, Jagland launched the World Forum for Democracy conferences at the Council of Europe. The annual conference brings together statesmen, NGOs, grassroots workers, academics, politicians and others and was inaugurated in 2012 by the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban ki Moon.

In April 2014, under Jagland&#x27;s watch, the Council of Europe released its seminal report &quot;State of Democracy, Human Rights and the Rule of Law in Europe&quot;. The report constituted the first consolidated analysis of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe, based on the findings of the Council of Europe&#x27;s monitoring bodies. In the preface to the report, Jagland wrote:

&quot;Human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe now face a crisis unprecedented since the end of the Cold War. Serious violations – including corruption, immunity from prosecution, impunity, human trafficking, racism, hate speech and discrimination – are on the rise throughout the continent. People&#x27;s rights are also threatened by the impact of the economic crisis and growing inequalities. The Council of Europe and its member States must act urgently to stop this erosion of fundamental rights...&quot;

=== Secretary General of the Council of Europe: Second term, from 2014 to 2019===

On 24 June 2014, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe convened to elect the Secretary General for the term running from 2014 to 2019. Thorbjørn Jagland had expressed his intentions of continuing on for a second term and was one of the two candidates competing for the post. Jagland was opposed by Ms Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger.

In the voting conducted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), of the 252 members voting, Jagland won 156. Ms Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger obtained 93. There were 3 blank ballots. With the requirement for an absolute majority being 125, Jagland&#x27;s tally of 156 gave him a comfortable absolute majority. Jagland formally commenced his next term from 1 October 2014.

Jagland&#x27;s re-election as Secretary General of the Council of Europe is without precedent. Several outgoing Secretaries General had stood for re-election without having been successful. His wide margin of victory is seen as a sign of approval and appreciation of his yeoman services to both the Council of Europe and his unstinting efforts to reduce tensions in Ukraine.

Jagland was continually accused by Norwegian and foreign media of servility towards Putin&#x27;s Russia during his tenure. Russia was placed under voting sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but in 2019 Jagland spearheaded the effort to give the Russians their voting rights back. Council members and analysts have criticized Jagland for giving in to Russian &quot;blackmail&quot;. 7 delegations left the council in protest of the decision to give Russia voting rights without ending the occupation of parts of Ukraine.

===Other positions===
He was vice-president of the Socialist International and was Chair of the Organisation&#x27;s Board when Willy Brandt was president. Jagland also chaired its Middle East Committee for 10 years. Furthermore, Jagland was one of five members of the Mitchell Committee appointed by President Clinton and Secretary-General Kofi Annan to advise on how to end violence in the Middle East. Jagland is an Honorary Board member of the Peres Center for Peace and was chair of the Board of the Oslo Centre for Peace and Human Rights but left when he became Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. A survey in 2000 found that Jagland was second most influential in a list of the 50 most influential persons in Norway.

Jagland has been member of the International Board of Governors at the Peres Center for Peace since 1997. He served as one of several vice presidents of the Socialist International from 1999 to 2008. From 2000 to 2006, he chaired the Socialist International Committee on the Middle East. He became chairman of the board of the Oslo Centre upon its establishment in 2006 but left in 2009 when he became chairman of the Norwegian Nobel committee.

==Political views==
Through his career in politics, Jagland was more to the left of his party. Jagland supported more of a traditional social democratic government, and was very skeptical of policies such as privatization of state-owned companies.

Jagland is in favour of Norwegian membership of the European Union. In 1990, he published the book &quot;Min europeiske drøm&quot; (&quot;My European dream&quot;). He proposed the European Union be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and it was, by Jagland himself in 2012. Since 1999, he has stated that the left wing in Norway does not use Socialist International enough.

He has outspokenly opposed the perceived presence of Islamophobia in Western societies. He has also called fighting Islamic extremism an &quot;unnecessary fight&quot;, &quot;that would only lead to confrontation&quot;, and insisted that no Islamic extremism exists in Norway.

<doc id="192086" wikidata="Q311421" url="?curid=192086" title="Jan P. Syse">
<text>(25 November 1930 – 17 September 1997) was a Norwegian lawyer and politician from the Conservative Party. He was the prime minister of Norway from 1989 to 1990. He also served as the minister of Industry from 1983 to 1985. Syse was the president of the Lagting 1993–1997. Syse was the president of the Nordic Council in 1988 and 1993. He served in the Norwegian parliament for over 25 years until his sudden death from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1997.

== Early life and career ==
Syse was born in Nøtterøy in the county of Vestfold. He was the son of Peter Syse (1888–1965) and Magnhild Bjønnes (1898–1985). His father was a local politician and dental surgeon.
He earned his examen artium in 1949 and his degree in law in 1957. He was politically active as a student, serving as chair of Den Konservative Studenterforening, Det Norske Studentersamfund, and the construction committee for Chateau Neuf.

His initial professional experience was as an attorney and manager for the deep sea shipping company Wilh. Wilhelmsen. He worked for Wilhelmsen at various times throughout his career, and was also employed as the editor for Wilhelmsen&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;Skib-rederi&quot;.

Jan P. Syse met Else Walstad (1936–2021) while they both were students at the University of Oslo in 1955, and they were married in 1959. They had two sons, philosopher Henrik Syse and diplomat Christian Syse.

==Political career==
After being a member of the national council for the Conservative Party since 1957, he started his elected political career in 1963 when he was elected to the Oslo city council, where he served two terms.

He was elected into the Storting as a deputy representative in 1965. He started his term as a full voting member in 1969 to replace Kåre Willoch who was a member of Borten&#x27;s Cabinet. Syse served on the Judiciary, Administration, Finance, extended Foreign Affairs and Constitution, and Constitutional committees throughout his parliamentary career. He was also sent as a parliamentary delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, Nordic Council, Inter-Parliamentary Union, and other international bodies. Syse was State Secretary to the Ministry of Justice from 1 November 1970 to 17 March 1971 in the non-Socialist coalition government led by Per Borten. He was Minister of Industry in the second cabinet Willoch from 16 September 1983 to 4 October 1985, and prime minister with the Syse Cabinet from 16 October 1989 to 3 November 1990.

==Political legacy==
Syse was well liked and respected among political allies and adversaries alike. He worked for cooperation within the Nordic region and also to strengthen the cooperation with the Baltic states, although he opposed their wish to join the Nordic council. His sons Christian Syse and Henrik Syse published &quot;Ta ikke den ironiske tonen - tanker og taler av Jan P. Syse&quot; (Oslo, Forlaget Press, 2003), a book that describes Syse&#x27;s speeches and style.

<text>Kåre Isaachsen Willoch (; 3 October 1928 – 6 December 2021) was a Norwegian politician who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1981 to 1986 and as leader of the Conservative Party from 1970 to 1974. He previously served as the minister of trade and shipping from August to September 1963 and 1965 to 1970, and as the president of the Nordic Council in 1973.

After stepping down as prime minister, he later served as Governor of both Oslo as well as Akershus counties from 1990 to 1998 and as chairman of Norway&#x27;s state broadcasting company NRK from 1998 to 2000. Following his retirement from politics he became an outspoken advocate of the environment and human rights and was widely respected for his activism including amongst Norway&#x27;s political left. He also wrote several books.

== Early life ==
Willoch was born on 3 October 1928 in Oslo, to Haakon Isaachsen Willoch (1898–1956) and his wife, Agnes Christine Saure (1896–1994). He grew up in the West End of Oslo, and took the examen artium in 1948. After that, he studied economics at the University of Oslo, where he was taught by the Nobel Prize winners Trygve Haavelmo and Ragnar Frisch. He graduated with the cand.oecon. degree in 1953. From 1951 onwards, Willoch was a member of the Oslo city council, and later in 1953, he became a deputy in the Parliament of Norway. He became a member of parliament after the 1957 parliamentary election, and was at 29 years then the youngest MP.

On 1 May 1954, he married Anne Marie Jørgensen (born 9 March 1930).

Willoch graduated as an economist (cand. oecon.) from the University of Oslo. He served in the Norwegian Brigade that formed part of the Allied occupation in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, after World War II, and became a dedicated friend of Germany during that time.

He spoke Norwegian, English, German and French fluently.

== Political life ==

An economist (characterized in 1981 as being &quot;supply side&quot;) by education and profession, Willoch made an early mark in national politics on issues related to economic development. He expressed deep skepticism about social democratic reforms throughout most of the post-World War II era and advocated a larger role for market mechanisms to solve economic problems.

Within the Conservative Party, Willoch was respected for his command of the issues and consistent ideological platform. In spite of friendly rivalries with Erling Norvik, Rolf Presthus, and Jan P. Syse, these and other party members led a political shift in Norway away from the nation&#x27;s social democratic legacy.

=== Parliamentary and ministerial posts ===

Willoch&#x27;s first political post was as a member of the Oslo City Council from 1952 to 1959.

Willoch was first elected to the Norwegian parliament at the age of 29 in 1957, representing Oslo. Thereafter he was elected in every parliamentary election until 1989.

He was appointed Minister of Trade in the short-lived but notable John Lyng cabinet from August to September 1963, following the Kings Bay Affair that brought to an end the uninterrupted chain of Labor governments after World War II, headed by Einar Gerhardsen and Oscar Torp.

He was appointed to the same ministerial post in the government of Per Borten from 1965 to 1970. He stepped down from this post to become first the Parliamentary leader, and then the chairman of the Conservative Party from 1970 to 1974.

In 1973, he unified his party in opposition to the newly introduced restrictions on use of land. This formed a watershed in Norwegian politics, in that the party adopted a stronger ideological alternative to the social democratic establishment that had dominated post-World War II politics. Some historians, notably Francis Sejersted attribute this in large part to the Norwegian Labour Party&#x27;s exuberant continuation of social democratic efforts.

Willoch served as the leader of the Foreign Affairs committee in the coalition government and from then until he retired from parliament in 1989.

As a member of the Borten government he faced the constitutional question of the marriage of the then Crown Prince Harald to a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen (they married in 1968 and since 1991 have been the king and queen of Norway ). Willoch is reported to have never considered opposing the union.

Most of Willoch&#x27;s political career was spent in opposition to various Labour governments. His rhetorical style was characterized by a use of language and carefully articulated viewpoints that many considered cold or even sarcastic. His debates with long-time adversary Gro Harlem Brundtland became legendary in Norway and were by several accounts based on personal as well as political differences. Brundtland wrote in her memoirs that she learned from Willoch &quot;how not to treat people, or parties.&quot;

=== Premiership ===

Willoch was asked to form a Conservative party government when a non-socialist coalition gained a majority in the parliamentary elections of 1981. The cabinet depended on the support of the Christian Democrats and Centre Party, and in 1983 these joined the cabinet to become a coalition government.

When Braathens SAFE Flight 139 was hijacked, the hijacker demanded to speak with Willoch.

By the parliamentary elections of 1985, Willoch&#x27;s cabinet had lost much of its parliamentary basis and was dependent on the Progress party for support. The cabinet lost a vote of no-confidence over Willoch&#x27;s proposal to increase surcharges on gasoline, when the Socialist Left Party, Labour Party, and Progress party joined forces. A minority government led by Gro Harlem Brundtland took over through the rest of the parliamentary period.

In spite of difficult parliamentary conditions, the Willoch cabinet embarked on a series of reforms that to many seemed like reversals of long-standing social democratic reforms, and to others changes that reflected new and emerging economic realities.

Often cited changes included:
* Dissolution of the governmental monopoly on radio and television broadcasting, including allowing the introduction of commercially funded content.
* Ending government intervention in credit markets, which in turn led to freer access to credit by both consumers and businesses.
* Reducing restrictions on ownership and sale of real estate
* Reducing restrictions on retail trade, especially with respect to opening hours
* Several efforts at strengthening the non-petroleum related Norwegian economy

The Willoch government&#x27;s foreign policy was largely consistent with those of prior Labour party cabinets in terms of Norwegian commitments under the NATO treaty, but deviated sharply on the issue of non-proliferation. Where the Labour Party promoted a policy of &quot;reduction of tensions&quot; in the Nordic region, which marginalized Norway in NATO, the Willoch cabinet approved forward logistical bases for U.S. rapid deployment forces and lent full support to the NATO double track decision of 1979.

Willoch earned a reputation as a sharp-witted, sometimes acerbic politician. During his years in parliament and in various governments, he was respected by his political allies and opponents alike, but never gained the popularity of other prime ministers in his time in office.

== Later life ==

Willoch served as county governor (&quot;fylkesmann&quot;) of Oslo and Akershus from 1990 to 1998. From 1998 to 2000 he was chairman of NRK, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. He was also director of the Nansen Institute. From 1986 on, he was deputy chairman of the International Democrat Union (IDU). He was President of the Deutsch-Norwegische Gesellschaft (German-Norwegian Society) from 1987 to 1991.
Considered one of the most pronounced conservative Norwegian politicians in his time, in later years he shifted his position in many areas and became known for his advocacy of human rights and environmental issues. He took issue with the &quot;culture of greed&quot;, &quot;tax paradises&#x27;, the environment, and criticised Israel&#x27;s policies toward Palestinians, stating that the occupation of and settlement on Palestinian land (outside the 1967 borders) is unlawful. The extent of the political left&#x27;s newfound respect for Willoch after he left office was summarised by social democrat former government minister Hallvard Bakke, who when criticising Willoch&#x27;s defense of some of his policies regarding the surveillance of communists in the 1980s noted that Willoch had become the most important voice on the Middle East conflict and many other issues, but that &quot;Willoch isn&#x27;t &quot;always&quot; right&quot;.

Widely respected for his activism and argumentative style, he accused Israel of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; stated that it is &quot;creating terror&quot; by cultivating extremism &quot;as if in a greenhouse in the Palestinian areas&quot;. Supporters of Israel such as Jo Benkow criticised his views as partisan and unapologetically pro-Palestinian. Willoch also stated that, though &quot;there are strong reasons to warn against the new antisemitism, it will not strengthen Israel&#x27;s cause to accuse critics of Israeli politics of antisemitism&quot;. He also claimed that Israel indirectly contributes to antisemitism stating that &quot;It would be naïve to ignore that Israel&#x27;s politics towards the Palestinians has become a new source of negative attitudes.&quot; In May 2006, Willoch invited Atef Adwan, an official in Hamas to a private luncheon at Det Norske Selskab, commenting that &quot;A dialogue with Hamas is very useful.&quot;

In an op-ed in the newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot;, Willoch summarized his views on Israel&#x27;s policies towards the Palestinians. He warned that &quot;those who defend the Israeli policies towards the Palestinians support a policy that generates a hatred that may lead to a disaster for Israel&quot; and concluded that &quot;Friends of Israel should seek to make Israel accept the Arab peace proposal. It demands, amongst other things, borders as before the war of 1967, only with such adjustments that the parties reach agreement upon, and guarantees for Israel&#x27;s security.&quot;

Willoch said the appointment of Rahm Emanuel, who had once volunteered for the Israeli military despite being a U.S. citizen and who had criticised the George W. Bush administration for not being supportive enough of Israel, was probably not an indication that President Barack Obama would significantly change U.S. policy on the Middle East, referencing then-ongoing U.S. debate on the appointment, in which Emanuel&#x27;s father Benjamin Emanuel, a former Irgun member, had said that &quot;obviously he will influence the president to be pro-Israel. Why wouldn’t he be? What is he, an Arab? He’s not going to clean the floors of the White House&quot;, a comment that Rahm Emanuel later apologised for. Willoch&#x27;s comment was later taken out of context by the anti-immigration Progress Party; liberal daily &quot;Dagbladet&quot; described the accusations against Willoch by the far-right as &quot;unreasonable, unfair, and at worst harmful.&quot;

Regarding Cablegate, he stated that &quot;the problem is that the Western world is violating Human rights, not that someone is uncovering those violations&quot;.

In 1996, Willoch was decorated as a Commander with Star of the Order of St. Olav.

Kåre Willoch died in his home in Oslo, on 6 December 2021, at the age of 93.
