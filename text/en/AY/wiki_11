<text>The Kara-Khanid Khanate (; ), also known as the Karakhanids, Qarakhanids, Ilek Khanids or the Afrasiabids (), was a Karluk Turkic khanate that ruled Central Asia from the 9th to the early 13th century. The dynastic names of Karakhanids and Ilek Khanids refer to royal titles with Kara Khagan being the most important Turkic title up until the end of the dynasty.

The Khanate conquered Transoxiana in Central Asia and ruled it independently between 999 and 1089. Their arrival in Transoxiana signaled a definitive shift from Iranic to Turkic predominance in Central Asia, yet the Kara-khanids gradually assimilated the Perso-Arab Muslim culture, while retaining some of their native Turkic culture. The Khanate split into the Eastern and Western Khanates in the 1040s. In the late 11th century, they came under the suzerainty of the Seljuk Empire followed by the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty) who defeated the Seljuks in the Battle of Qatwan in 1141. The Eastern Khanate ended in 1211, and the Western Khanate was extinguished by the Khwarazmian Empire in 1212.

The capitals of the Kara-Khanid Khanate included Kashgar, Balasagun, Uzgen and Samarkand. The history of the Kara-Khanid Khanate is reconstructed from fragmentary and often contradictory written sources, as well as studies on their coinage.

==Names==
The term &quot;Karakhanid&quot; was derived from &quot;Qara Khan&quot; or &quot;Qara Khaqan&quot; (), the foremost title of the rulers of the dynasty. The word &quot;Kara&quot; means &quot;black&quot; and also &quot;courageous&quot; from Old Turkic (ê∞¥ê∞∫ê∞Ä) and &quot;khan&quot; means ruler. The term was devised by European Orientalists in the 19th century to describe both the dynasty and the Turks ruled by it. 
* Arabic Muslim sources called this dynasty &quot;al-Khaqaniya&quot; (&quot;That of the Khaqans&quot;) or &quot;al Muluk al-Khaniyya al-Atrak&quot; (The Khanal kings of the Turks).
* In his linguistic treatise &quot;Dƒ´wƒÅn LughƒÅt al-Turk&quot;, Mahmud al-Kashgari, a native-born Karakhanid, listed two endonyms: &quot;KhƒÅqƒÅnƒ´ Turks&quot; or just &quot;Turks&quot;, the latter he also used to denote Turkic peoples in general. 
* Persian sources often used the term &quot;Al-i Afrasiyab&quot; () based on a supposed link to the legendary though actually unrelated King Afrasiab of pre-Islamic Transoxania. Kashgari refers to him as Alp Er Tunga.
* They are also referred to as Ilek Khanids or Ilak Khanids () in Persian.
* Chinese sources refer to this dynasty as &quot;Kalahan&quot; () or &quot;Heihan&quot; (, literally &quot;Black Khan&quot;) or &quot;Dashi&quot; (, a term for Arabs that extends to Muslims in general).

==History==
===Origin===
The Kara-Khanid Khanate originated from a confederation formed some time in the 9th century by Karluks, Yagmas, Chigils, Tuhsi, and other peoples living in Zhetysu, Western Tian Shan (modern Kyrgyzstan), and Western Xinjiang around Kashgar. 10th-century Arab historian Al-Masudi listed two &quot;Khagan of Khagans&quot; of the Karluk horde: Sanah, a possible rendition of Ashina (compare ≈öaya (also by al-Masudi), A≈õ(i)nas (al-Tabari), ƒÄnsa (Hudud al-&#x27;Alam), and ≈öaba (Ibn Khordadbeh)), and Afrasiab, whom 11th-century Karakhanid scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari identified with Turkic king Alp Er Tunga, the legendary progenitor of the Karakhanid ruling dynasty. Furthermore, Kara-khanid heads of state claimed the title khagan, which indicates that they may have been descended from the Ashina. Even so, the tribal origin of Bilge Kul Qadir Khan, the first Kara-Khan, is still unknown: if Bilge Kul Qadir descended from the Karluk Yabghus, then he indeed belonged to the Ashina dynasty as they did; if Bilge Kul Qadir descended from the Yagma (as suggested by Vasily Bartold), then he did not, considering that the Hudud al-&#x27;Alam stated that &quot;Their [Yagmas&#x27;] king is from the family of the Toƒ°uzƒ°uz kings&quot;, that Ashina tribe was not listed among the Toquz Oghuz (Ch. ‰πùÂßì &quot;Jƒ≠u X√¨ng&quot; &quot;Nine Surnames&quot;) in Chinese-language sources and that early Uyghur khagans belonged to the Yaglakar clan of Toquz Oghuz and later Uyghur khagans belonged to the √Ñdiz clan. Alternatively, Bilge Kul Qadir might belong to the E√∞gi≈ü or Chigils.

====Early history====

The Karluks were a nomadic people from the western Altai Mountains who moved to Zhetysu (Semirechye). In 742, the Karluks were part of an alliance led by the Basmyl and Uyghurs that rebelled against the G√∂kt√ºrks and led to the demise of the Second Turkic Khaganate (682‚Äì744). In the realignment of power that followed, the Karluks were elevated from a tribe led by an &quot;Elteber&quot; to one led by a &quot;yabghu&quot;, which was one of the highest Turkic dignitaries and also implies membership in the Ashina clan in whom the &quot;heaven-mandated&quot; right to rule resided. The Karluks and Uyghurs later allied themselves against the Basmyl, and within two years they toppled the Basmyl khagan. The Uyghur yabghu became khagan and the Karluk leader yabghu. This arrangement lasted less than a year. Hostilities between the Uyghur and Karluk forced the Karluk to migrate westward into the western Turgesh lands.
By 766 the Karluks had forced the submission of the Turgesh and they established their capital at Suyab on the Chu River. The Karluk confederation by now included the Chigil and Tukshi tribes who may have been T√ºrgesh tribes incorporated into the Karluk union. The Karluks converted to Nestorian Christianity at the end of the 8th century CE, about 15 years after they established themselves in the Semerich&#x27;e region. This was the first time the Church of the East received such major sponsorship by an eastern power. Remains of a Nestorian church have been found in the Karluk capital of Suyab, as well as hundreds of tomstones with Nestorian Syriac inscriptions in the Semerich&#x27;e region.

By the mid-9th century, the Karluk confederation had gained control of the sacred lands of the Western T√ºrks after the destruction of the Uyghur Khaganate by the Old Kirghiz. Control of sacred lands, together with their affiliation with the Ashina clan, allowed the Khaganate to be passed on to the Karluks along with domination of the steppes after the previous Khagan was killed in a revolt.

During the 9th century southern Central Asia was under the rule of the Samanids, while the Central Asian steppe was dominated by Turkic nomads such as the Pechenegs, the Oghuz Turks, and the Karluks. The domain of the Karluks reached as far north as the Irtysh and the Kimek confederation, with encampments extending to the Chi and Ili rivers, where the Chigil and Tukshi tribes lived, and east to the Ferghana valley and beyond. The area to the south and east of the Karluks was inhabited by the Yagma. The Karluk center in the 9th and 10th centuries appears to have been at Balasagun on the Chu River. In the late 9th century the Samanids marched into the steppes and captured Taraz, one of the headquarters of the Karluk khagan, and a large church was transformed into a mosque.

==Formation of the Kara-Khanid Khanate (840 CE)==
During the 9th century, the Karluk confederation (including three chief tribes: the Bulaq (&quot;Mouluo&quot; Ë¨ÄËêΩ / &quot;Moula&quot; Ë¨ÄÂâå), Ta≈ül√Øk (&quot;Tashili&quot; Ë∏èÂØ¶Âäõ), and Sebek (Suofu Â®ëÂåê), along with Chigils, Charuks, Barskhans, Khalajes, Azkishi and Tuhsis (the last three being possibly remnants of T√ºrgesh) and the Yaghma, possible descendants of the Toquz Oghuz, joined forces and formed the first Karluk-Karakhanid khaganate. The Chigils appear to have formed the nucleus of the Karakhanid army. The date of its foundation and the name of its first khan is uncertain, but according to one reconstruction, the first Karakhanid ruler was Bilge Kul Qadir Khan.

The rulers of the Karakhanids were likely to be from the Chigil and Yaghma tribes ‚Äì the Eastern Khagan bore the title &quot;Arslan Qara Khaqan&quot; (Arslan &quot;lion&quot; was the totem of the Chigil) and the Western Khagan the title &quot;Bughra Qara Khaqan&quot; (Bughra &quot;male camel&quot; was the totem of the Yaghma). The names of animals were a regular element in the Turkic titles of the Karakhanids: thus Aslan (lion), Bughra (camel), Toghan (falcon), B√∂ri (wolf), and Toghrul or Toghr√Øl (a bird of prey). Under the Khagans were four rulers with the titles Arslan Ilig, Bughra Ilig, Arslan Tegin and Bughra Tegin. The titles of the members of the
dynasty changed with their position, normally upwards, in the dynastic hierarchy.

===Conversion to Islam ()===
In the mid-10th century the Kara-Khanids converted to Islam and adopted Muslim names and honorifics, but retained Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, Khagan, Ilek (Ilig) and Tegin. Later they adopted the Arab titles &quot;sultan&quot; and &quot;sultƒÅn al-salƒÅtƒ´n&quot; (&quot;Sultan of Sultans&quot;). According to the Ottoman historian known as Munajjim-bashi, a Karakhanid prince named Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan was the first of the khans to convert. After conversion, he obtained a fatwa which permitted him in effect to kill his presumably-still-pagan father, after which he conquered Kashgar (of the old Shule Kingdom). Later, in 960, according to Muslim historians Ibn Miskawaih and Ibn al-Athir, there was a mass conversion of the Turks (reportedly &quot;200,000 tents of the Turks&quot;), and circumstantial evidence suggests these were the Karakhanids.

===Conquest of Transoxiana===

The grandson of Satuk Bughra Khan, Hasan b. Sulayman (or Harun) (title: Bughra Khan) attacked the Samanids in the late 10th century. Between 990 and 992, Hasan took Isfijab, Ferghana, Ilaq, Samarkand, and the Samanid capital Bukhara. However, Hasan Bughra Khan died in 992 due to an illness, and the Samanids returned to Bukhara.

Hasan&#x27;s cousin Ali b. Musa (title: Kara Khan or Arslan Khan) resumed the campaign against the Samanids, and by 999 Ali&#x27;s son Nasr had taken Chach, Samarkand, and Bukhara. The Samanid domains were divided between the Ghaznavids, who gained Khorasan and Afghanistan, and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana. The Oxus River thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.

The Karakhanid state was divided into appanages (√úl√º≈ü system), as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads. The Karakhanid appanages were associated with four principal urban centers, Balasagun (then the capital of the Karakhanid state) in Zhetysu, Kashgar in Xinjiang, Uzgen in Fergana, and Samarkand in Transoxiana. The dynasty&#x27;s original domains of Zhetysu and Kasgar and their khans retained an implicit seniority over those who ruled in Transoxiana and Fergana. The four sons of Ali (Ahmad, Nasr, Mansur, Muhammad) each held their own independent appanage within the Karakhanid state. Nasr, the conqueror of Transoxiana, held the large central area of Transoxiana (Samarkand and Bukhara), Fergana (Uzgen) and other areas, although after his death his appanage was further divided. Ahmad held Zhetysu and Chach and became the head of the dynasty after the death of Ali. The brothers Ahmad and Nasr conducted different policies towards the Ghaznavids in the south ‚Äì while Ahmad tried to form an alliance with Mahmud of Ghazna, Nasr attempted to expand unsuccessfully into Ghaznavid territory.
Ahmad was succeeded by Mansur, and after the death of Mansur, the Hasan Bughra Khan branch of the Karakhanids became dominant. Hasan&#x27;s sons Muhammad Toghan Khan II, and Yusuf Kadir Khan who held Kashgar, became in turn the head of the Karakhanid dynasty. The two families, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the descendants of Ali Arslan Khan and Hasan Bughra Khan, would eventually split the Karakhanid Khanate in two.

In 1017‚Äì1018, the Karakhanids repelled an attack by a large mass of nomadic Turkic tribes in what was described in Muslim sources as a great victory. Around the same time, the Kara-Khanid ruler Ilig Khan reached an agreement with Mahmud of Ghazni, in which they agreed to partition former Samanid territory along the Oxus river.

===Conquest of western Tarim Basin===
The Islamic conquest of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar began when the Karakhanid Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan converted to Islam in 934 and then captured Kashgar. He and his son directed endeavors to proselytize Islam among the Turks and engage in military conquests. In the mid-10th century, Satuq&#x27;s son Musa began to put pressure on Khotan, and a long period of war between Kashgar and the Kingdom of Khotan ensued. Satok Bughra Khan&#x27;s nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was said to have been killed by Buddhists during the war; during the reign of Ahmad b. Ali, the Karakhanids also engaged in wars against non-Muslims to the east and northeast.

Muslim accounts tell the tale of the four imams from Mada&#x27;in city (possibly now in Iraq) who travelled to help Yusuf Qadir Khan, the Qarakhanid leader, in his conquest of Khotan, Yarkend, and Kashgar. The &quot;infidels&quot; were said to have been driven towards Khotan, but the four Imams were killed. In 1006, Yusuf Qadir Khan of Kashgar conquered the Kingdom of Khotan, ending Khotan&#x27;s existence as an independent state.

The conquest of the western Tarim Basin which includes Khotan and Kashgar is significant in the eventual Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, and modern Uyghurs identify with the Karakhanids even though the name Uyghur was taken from the Manichaean Uyghur Khaganate and the Buddhist state of Qocho.

===Division of the Kara-Khanid Khanate===
Early in the 11th century the unity of the Karakhanid dynasty was fractured by frequent internal warfare that eventually resulted in the formation of two independent Karakhanid states. A son of Hasan Bughra Khan, Ali Tegin, seized control of Bukhara and other towns. He expanded his territory further after the death of Mansur. The son of Nasr, B√∂ritigin, later waged war against the sons of Ali Tegin, and won control of a large part of Transoxiana, making Samarkand the capital. In 1041, another son of Nasr b. Ali, Muhammad &#x27;Ayn ad-Dawlah (reigned 1041‚Äì52) took over the administration of the western branch of the family that eventually led to a formal separation of the Khara-Khanid Khanate. Ibrahim Tamghach Khan was considered by Muslim historians as a great ruler, and he brought some stability to the Western Karakhanids by limiting the appanage system that caused much of the internal strife in the Kara-Khanid Khanate.

The Hasan family remained in control of the Eastern Khanate. The Eastern Khanate had its capital at Balasaghun and later Kashgar. The Fergana-Zhetysu areas became the border between the two states and were frequently contested. When the two states were formed, Fergana fell into realm of the Eastern Khanate, but was later captured by Ibrahim and became part of the Western Khanate.

===Seljuk suzerainty===

In 1040, the Seljuk Empire defeated the Ghaznavids at the Battle of Dandanaqan and entered Iran. Conflict with the Karakhanids broke out, but the Karakhanids were able to withstand attacks by the Seljuks initially, even briefly taking control of Seljuk towns in Greater Khorasan. The Karakhanids, however, developed serious conflicts with the religious classes (the &quot;ulama&quot;), and the &quot;ulama&quot; of Transoxiana then requested the intervention of the Seljuks. In 1089, during the reign of Ibrahim&#x27;s grandson Ahmad b. Khidr, the Seljuks entered and took control of Samarkand, together with the domains belonging to the Western Khanate. For half a century, the Western Karakhanid Khanate was a vassal of the Seljuks, who largely controlled the appointment of the Khanate&#x27;s rulers in that time. Ahmad b. Khidr was returned to power by the Seljuks, but in 1095, the &quot;ulama&quot; accused Ahmad of heresy and managed to secure his execution.

The Karakhanids of Kashgar also declared their submission following a Seljuk campaign into Talas and Zhetysu, but the Eastern Khanate was a Seljuk vassal for only a short time. At the beginning of the 12th century the Eastern Khanate invaded Transoxiana and briefly occupied the Seljuk town of Termez.

=== Qara Khitai invasion ===
The Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty) host which invaded Central Asia was composed of remnants from the defunct Liao dynasty which was annihilated by the Jin dynasty in 1125. The Liao noble Yel√º Dashi recruited warriors from various tribes and formed a horde that moved westward to rebuild the Liao dynasty. Yel√º occupied Balasagun on the Chu River, then defeated the Western Karakhanids in Khujand in 1137. In 1141 Qara Khitai became the dominant force in the region after they dealt a devastating blow to the Seljuk Sultan Ahmad Sanjar and the Kara-Khanids at the Battle of Qatwan near Samarkand. Several military commanders of Karakhanid lineages such as the father of Osman of Khwarazm fled from Karakhanid lands in the wake of the Qara Khitai invasion.
Despite losing to the Qara Khitai, the Karakhanid dynasty remained in power as their vassals. The Qara Khitai themselves stayed at Zhetysu near Balasagun, and allowed some of the Karakhanids to continue to rule as their tax collectors in Samarkand and Kashgar. Under the Qara Khitai the Karakhanids functioned as administrators for sedentary Muslim populations. While the Qara Khitai were Buddhists ruling over a largely Muslim population, they were considered fair-minded rulers whose reign was marked by religious tolerance. Islamic religious life continued uninterrupted and Islamic authority persevered under the Qara Khitai. Kashgar became a Nestorian metropolitan see and Christian gravestones in the Chu River Valley appeared beginning in this period. However, Kuchlug, a Naiman who usurped the throne of the Qara Khitai dynasty, instituted anti-Islamic policies on the local populations under his rule.

=== Downfall ===
The decline of the Seljuks following their defeat by the Qara Khitais at the Battle of Qatwan (1141) allowed the Khwarazmian dynasty, then a vassal of the Qara Khitai, to expand into former Seljuk territory, where they became independent rulers circa 1190. In 1207, the citizens of Bukhara revolted against the &quot;sadrs&quot; (leaders of the religious classes), which the Khwarazmshah &#x27;Ala&#x27; ad-Din Muhammad used as a pretext to conquer Bukhara. Muhammad then formed an alliance with the Western Karakhanid ruler Uthman ibn Ibrahim (who later married Muhammad&#x27;s daughter) against the Qara Khitai. In 1210, the Khwarezm-Shah took Samarkand after the Qara Khitai retreated to deal with the rebellion from the Naiman Kuchlug, who had seized the Qara Khitans&#x27; treasury at Uzgen. The Khwarezm-Shah then defeated the Qara Khitai near Talas. Muhammad and Kuchlug had, apparently, agreed to divide up the Qara Khitan&#x27;s empire. In 1212, the population of Samarkand staged a revolt against the Khwarezmians, a revolt which Uthman supported, and massacred them. The Khwarezm-Shah returned, recaptured Samarkand and executed Uthman. He demanded the submission of all leading Karakhanids, and finally extinguished the Western Karakhanid state.

In 1204, a rebellion of the Eastern Kara-Khanid in Kashgar was suppressed by the Kara-Khitai who took the prince Yusuf hostage to Balasagun. The prince was later released but he was killed in Kashgar by rebels in 1211, effectively ending the Eastern Kara-Khanid. In 1214, the rebels in Kashgar surrendered to Kuchlug, who had usurped the Kara-Khitai throne. In 1218, Kuchlug was killed by the Mongol army. Some of the Kara-Khitai&#x27;s eastern vassals including Eastern Kara-Khanids then joined the Mongol forces to conquer the Khwarezmian Empire.

== Culture ==

The takeover by the Karakhanids did not change the essentially Iranian character of Central Asia, though it set into motion a demographic and ethnolinguistic shift. During the Karakhanid era, the local population began using Turkic in speech ‚Äì initially the shift was linguistic with the local people adopting the Turkic language. While Central Asia became Turkicized over the centuries, culturally the Turks came close to being Persianized or, in certain respects, Arabicized. Nevertheless, the official or court language used in Kashgar and other Karakhanid centers, referred to as &quot;Khaqani&quot; (royal), remained Turkic. The language was partly based on dialects spoken by the Turkic tribes that made up the Karakhanids and possessed qualities of linear descent from K√∂k and Karluk Turkic. The Turkic script was also used for all documents and correspondence of the khaqans, according to &quot;Dƒ´wƒÅnu l-Luƒ°at al-Turk&quot;.

The &quot;Dƒ´wƒÅnu l-Luƒ°at al-Turk&quot; (Dictionary of Languages of the Turks) was written by a prominent Karakhanid historian, Mahmud al-Kashgari, who may have lived for some time in Kashgar at the Karakhanid court. He wrote this first comprehensive dictionary of Turkic languages in Arabic for the Caliphs of Baghdad in 1072‚Äì76. Another famous Karakhanid writer was Yusuf Balasaghuni, who wrote &quot;Kutadgu Bilig&quot; (The Wisdom of Felicity), the only known literary work written in Turkic from the Karakhanid period. &quot;Kutadgu Bilig&quot; is a form of advice literature known as mirrors for princes. The Turkic identity is evident in both of these pieces of work, but they also showed the influences of Persian and Islamic culture. However, the court culture of the Karakhanids remained almost entirely Persian. The two last western khaqans also wrote poetry in Persian.

&quot;The Cambridge World History&quot; describes the Kara-Khanid state as the first of the Islamic Turco-Iranian states.

Islam and its civilization flourished under the Karakhanids. The earliest example of &quot;madrasas&quot; in Central Asia was founded in Samarkand by Ibrahim Tamghach Khan. Ibrahim also founded a hospital to care for the sick as well as providing shelter for the poor. His son Shams al-Mulk Nasr built ribats for the caravanserais on the route between Bukhara and Samarkand, as well as a palace near Bukhara. Some of the buildings constructed by the Karakhanids still survive today, including the Kalyan minaret built by Mohammad Arslan Khan beside the main mosque in Bukhara, and three mausolea in Uzgend. The early Karakhanid rulers, as nomads, lived not in the city but in an army encampment outside the capital, and while by the time of Ibrahim the Karakhanids still maintained a nomadic tradition, their extensive religious and civil constructions showed that they had assimilated the culture and traditions of the settled population of Transoxiana. During the excavations of the citadel of Samarkand, the ruins of the palace of the Karakhanid ruler Ibrahim ibn Hussein (1178‚Äì1202) were found. The palace was decorated with wall paintings.

Numerous works of art and decorative objects are also known from the realm of the Kara-Khanids during the time of their rule (840‚Äì1212). Samarkand, with its old citadel of Afrasiab where many works of art have been excavated, was conquered by the Kara-Khanids between 990 and 992, and held until 1212 (11th‚Äì12th centuries):
== Legacy ==
Kara-Khanid is arguably the most enduring cultural heritage among coexisting cultures in Central Asia from the 9th to the 13th centuries. The Karluk-Uyghur dialect spoken by the nomadic tribes and Turkified sedentary populations under Kara-Khanid rule formed two major branches of the Turkic language family, the Chagatay and the Kypchak. The Kara-Khanid cultural model that combined nomadic Turkic culture with Islamic, sedentary institutions spread east into former Kara-Khoja and Tangut territories and west and south into the subcontinent, Khorasan (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Northern Iran), Golden Horde territories (Tataristan), and Turkey. The Chagatay, Timurid, and Uzbek states and societies inherited most of the cultures of the Kara-Khanids and the Khwarezmians without much interruption.

The Kara-Khanids translated the Quran into Middle Turkic. There are four surviving copies of the Quran translations found in various collections and a Middle Turkic excerpt of Al-Fatiha, which supposedly belong to the Kara-Khanid period.

==Identification with China==

Kara-Khanid monarchs adopted &quot;Tamghaj Khan&quot; (Turkic for &quot;Khan of China&quot;; ) or &quot;Malik al-Mashriq wa-l‚ÄôSin&quot; (Arabic for &quot;King of the East and China&quot;; ) as their title, and minted coins bearing these titles. Another title they used was &quot;Sul·π≠ƒÅn al-Sharq wa al-·π¢ƒ´n&quot; (Sultan of the East and China). Early period &quot;proto-Qarakhanid&quot; coinage featured Chinese-style square-holed coins, combined with Arabic writing.

Much of the realm of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, including Transoxiana and the western Tarim Basin, had been under the rule of the Tang dynasty prior to the Battle of Talas in 751, and the Kara-Khanid rulers continued to identify their dynasty with China several centuries later. Yusuf Qadir Khan sent the first Kara-Khanid envoy to the Song dynasty, Boyla Saghun, to request the Song to send an official envoy who would help &#x27;pacify&#x27; Khotan, apparently seeking to use the prestige of the Chinese court to strengthen the Kara-Khanids&#x27; local status.

The Kara-Khanid rulers also formed marriage relations with the Liao dynasty and addressed the Song emperors as &quot;maternal uncle&quot;, in possible imitation of Uyghur and Tibetan rulers who had marital relations with the previous Tang dynasty.

In an account, the Kara-Khanid scholar Mahmud al-Kashgari referred to his homeland, around Kashgar, then part of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, as &quot;Lower China&quot;.

==Genetics==
A genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2018 examined the remains of three Khara-Khanid individuals. They were found to be carrying the maternal haplogroups G2a2, A and J1c. The Kara-Khanid were found to have more East Asian ancestry than the preceding Gokt√ºrks.

<text>A liaison aircraft (also called an army cooperation aircraft) is a small, usually unarmed aircraft primarily used by military forces for artillery observation or transporting commanders and messages. 

==Operation==
The concept developed before World War II and included also battlefield reconnaissance, air ambulance, column control, light cargo delivery and similar duties. Able to operate from small, unimproved fields under primitive conditions, with STOL capabilities, most liaison aircraft were developed from, or were later used as general aviation aircraft. Both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters can perform liaison duties.

<doc id="188063" wikidata="Q2406923" url="?curid=188063" title="8.8 cm KwK 43">
<text>The 8.8¬†cm KwK 43 (&quot;Kampfwagenkanone&quot; ‚Äî&quot;fighting vehicle cannon&quot;) was an 88¬†mm 71-calibre-length tank gun designed by Krupp and used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It was mounted as the primary armament on the Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B &quot;Tiger II&quot;. The 8.8 cm Pak 43, an anti-tank gun, was very similar in design but mounted on tank destroyers or deployed stand-alone on the field.

==Design and development==
At , the length of the KwK 43&#x27;s barrel was over 1.3 metres longer than of that of the 8.8 cm KwK 36 used for the Tiger I. The cartridge of the KwK 43&#x27;s shell was also considerably longer (at ) and wider than that of the KwK 36&#x27;s, meaning that the KwK 43 allows for more room for a heavier propellant charge in its cartridge case than the KwK 36 could. All guns of the Pak/KwK 43 series could use the same ammunition interchangeably.

The KwK 43 and Pak 43 were initially manufactured with monobloc barrels, meaning the barrel was made from one piece. However, due to the weapons&#x27; extremely high muzzle velocity and operating pressures when fired, the weapon suffered from accelerated barrel wear. As a result, the change was made to manufacture the Pak/KwK 43 with a two-piece barrel instead of a monobloc barrel. This had minimal to no effect on the performance of the gun, but made replacing a worn-out barrel much faster and easier than before.

In addition, the massively increased operating pressures of the new gun also required a new armour-piercing shell to be designed. The result of this was the PzGr.39/43 APCBC-HE projectile, which was similar to the older PzGr.39-1 APCBC-HE projectile used by the 8.8¬†cm KwK 36 and Pak 43 guns except for the addition of much wider driving bands. The wider driving bands of the PzGr.39/43 increased the weight of the shell to as a result. However, as the full transition to the newer PzGr.39/43 rounds was slow to take place, the older PzGr.39-1 rounds were instead allowed to be used for the KwK 43 &amp; Pak 43 provided the gun had fired no more than 500 rounds. Above that set amount, the expected barrel wear combined with the narrower driving bands of the PzGr.39-1 would lead to a loss of pressure and therefore muzzle velocity in the gun. The new PzGr.39/43 could be fired without loss of pressure until the barrel was worn out, thus requiring no restriction.
PzGr.39-1 FES &amp; Al all up weight: 10.2¬†kg (9.87¬†kg without fuse &amp; bursting charge)
PzGr.39/43 FES &amp; Al all up weight: 10.4¬†kg (10.06¬†kg without fuse &amp; bursting charge)

The same 278¬†gram BdZ 5127 fuse and 59¬†gram Amatol bursting charge were used for both types of projectile (PzGr.39-1 &amp; PzGr.39/43), requiring armoured targets of 30¬†mm or thicker to ignite after penetration for maximum behind-armour effects.

==Performance==

===PzGr. 39/43 (APCBC-HE)===
* Type: Armour-piercing, capped, ballistic cap - high explosive

== Penetration comparison ==

==Anti-tank gun==

The anti-tank gun version of the 8.8¬†cm KwK 43 was known as the 8.8 cm Pak 43. This name was also applied to versions of this weapon mounted in various armored vehicles designed to hunt tanks, such as the Jagdpanther, Hornisse/Nashorn and Ferdinand/Elefant &quot;Panzerj√§ger&quot; tank destroyers. The Nashorn was the first vehicle to carry the KwK/Pak 43 series of guns. The series included: Pak 43 (cruciform mount), Pak 43/41 (two-wheel split-trail carriage), Pak 43/1 (Nashorn), and Pak 43/2 (Ferdinand/Elefant), all with monobloc (one-piece) barrels; Pak 43/3 and 43/4 (Jagdpanther) with two-piece barrels, and KwK 43 (Tiger II) with a two-piece barrel.

<text>Sh≈çgun is a 1975 historical novel by author James Clavell that chronicles the end of Japan‚Äôs Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568-1600) and the dawn of the Edo period (1603-1868). Loosely based on actual events and figures, &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; narrates how European interests and internal conflicts within Japan brought about the Shogunate restoration.

By 1980 six million copies of &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; had been sold worldwide. The novel has been adapted into two TV series (in 1980 and 2024), a stage production (&quot;Sh≈çgun: The Musical&quot;), a board game, and three video games. Though its historical setting is the earliest, it is the third of six published books in Clavell&#x27;s broader &quot;Asian Saga&quot; series.

==Premise==
For nearly 30 years, Japan had been fractured by dynastic clashes and was without a Shogun (central ruler). Japan was also interfered with militarily and politically by Catholic Portugal in concert with the Roman Papacy and its Jesuits stationed in Japan and elsewhere in North East Asia. Their prime interests in Japan were to control trade with Europe and to propagate Roman Catholicism. Portugal had profited as Japan‚Äôs exclusive European trading partner for more than 50 years, but it became uneasy when the newly arrived Protestant Dutch threatened their monopoly.

==Plot==
The clandestine mission of the Dutch ship &quot;Erasmus&quot; was to compete with Portugal for Japan and the rest of the lucrative far East Asian trade. After much of its crew, including its captain, dies, it ends up marooned in Izu Harbor, the survivors thereby becoming the first Protestants to set foot in Japan.

The ship‚Äôs crew is held captive while armaments, records and coin are seized by Izu‚Äôs &quot;daimy≈ç&quot; (lord) Yabu. Yabu had hoped to keep the ship a secret, but a spy reported the ship‚Äôs arrival to his liege Toranaga, Lord of the Kant≈ç and President of the Council of Regents. Toranaga has the ship‚Äôs navigator Blackthorne brought to him in Osaka, knowing that the &quot;Erasmus&quot; could be a source of advantages against Lord Ishido, his chief rival in the Council.

Toranaga&#x27;s meeting with Blackthorne is faithfully translated by a Portuguese Jesuit, Father Alvito, despite revelations of war between Catholic Portugal and Elizabethan England. Until then Toranaga was unaware that Christendom was so divided.

To sequester Blackthorne from the other regents, he is imprisoned with a Franciscan friar who teaches Blackthorne rudimentary Japanese and relates how the Jesuits&#x27; &quot;r≈çnin&quot; (mercenaries) invaded Japan and launched violent agitations to profit the Portuguese crown. Before the two Catholic regents, urged on by the Jesuits, can have him executed, Blackthorne is abducted in transit and returned to Toranaga.

Lady Toda Mariko (a Jesuit-educated Catholic loyal to Toranaga, not her church) faithfully translates to Toranaga Blackthorne&#x27;s account of the Pope granting Portugal colonial rights to Japan and East Asia in return for replacement of all non-Catholic lords, including Toranaga, with those loyal to Portugal and Rome. He also relates the Franciscan‚Äôs report of Catholic &quot;r≈çnin&quot; from Macau invading Japan.

Toranaga is taken aback and refuses Portugal&#x27;s trading ship request to leave Japan. In turn the regents, after once again failing to assassinate Blackthorne, try to force Toranaga to commit seppuku. Instead he resigns from the council and flees Osaka. Aided by Blackthorne‚Äôs clownish antics, he, Toranaga, Mariko and others of his court make it to Anjiro, which is safer. Toranaga elevates Blackthorne to the samurai rank of hatamoto and gifts him a consort, Fujiko.

In Anjiro, Blackthorne threatens to commit seppuku after Yabu says he will burn down the village if the Englishman doesn&#x27;t learn Japanese fast enough. He is narrowly stopped by Omi. Slowly, Blackthorne‚Äôs grasp of Japanese speech and customs improves. He trains a contingent of samurai in European-style warfare, and after a devastating earthquake, rescues Toranaga from underneath rubble. In turn Blackthorne raises his regard for Toranaga and for Mariko, a key member of Toranga‚Äôs inner circle, and with whom he secretly has an affair. A chance encounter with Blackthorne&#x27;s old crew finds them revolted by his Japanese ways, and he by the coarseness of their European character.

To deflect suspicions, Toranaga feigns to all except Mariko acquiescence towards Ishido and professes no desire to do battle. When Toranaga&#x27;s half-brother Zataki, who has allied with Ishido, arrives, Toranaga apparently surrenders and has Mariko re-enter Osaka with the intention to lay bare Ishido‚Äôs holding of noble households hostage. When, as planned, Mariko tries to exit Osaka, Ishido&#x27;s men violently block her party until an intentionally unharmed Mariko gives up on leaving. Saying she has been dishonored, Mariko vows to kill herself the next day. She almost ends her life, but in a delaying gambit, Ishido grants her leave at the last minute. That night Toranaga&#x27;s duplicitous vassal Yabu lets Ishido&#x27;s ninjas into Toranaga&#x27;s compound to kidnap Mariko. Having retreated to a storeroom, Mariko willfully stands in front of a door set to explode and is killed. Her death, which Ishido sought to prevent, forces him to free his noble hostages, thus weakening military alliances. As Blackthorne and Yabu leave, the Jesuits inform the former that the &quot;Erasmus&quot; has been sunk. As for Yabu, he confesses to Toranaga and obeys his lord&#x27;s order to commit seppuku, giving his prized katana to Blackthorne. Mariko wills money to Blackthorne to build a seaworthy ship for Toranaga‚Äôs navy.

At the book&#x27;s end, Toranaga in soliloquy says he sank the &quot;Erasmus&quot; to form alliances with the Catholic lords, who in return agreed not to kill Blackthorne. Blackthorne‚Äôs karma, Toranaga says, is to never leave Japan, as Mariko&#x27;s karma was to die for her lord, and as Toranaga&#x27;s is to become shogun. The book‚Äôs epilogue takes place after the Battle of Sekigahara with Toranaga burying Ishido up to his neck until he dies three days later.

==Characters==
&quot;Shogun&quot; is a work of historical fiction based upon the power struggle between the successors of Toyotomi Hideyoshi that led to the founding of the Tokugawa shogunate. Clavell based each character on a historical figure, but changed their names in order to add narrative deniability to the story.

==Historical accuracy==
Blackthorne&#x27;s interactions with Toranaga are closely based upon accounts in the diaries of William Adams (1564‚Äì1620). However, while Adams served in Tokugawa&#x27;s army at Sekigahara, he did not become a retainer or a samurai until after the battle.

Adams never met Hosokawa Gracia, in contrast to Blackthorne&#x27;s intimate relationship with Toda Mariko.

The novel contains numerous Japanese language errors, as well as mistakenly depicting Japanese castles as having portcullises and 17th-century samurai as using socket bayonets. Carrier pigeons, used extensively by Toranaga, were unknown in Japan at the time.

==Background==
Clavell was an officer in the Royal Artillery during World War II and was a prisoner of war at Changi Prison in Singapore from 1942 to 1945, an experience that formed the basis of his first novel &quot;King Rat&quot;. Despite this experience, he admired Japan and the Japanese people, and described &quot;Shogun&quot; as &quot;passionately pro-Japanese.&quot;

Clavell stated that reading a sentence in his daughter&#x27;s textbook that stated that &quot;in 1600, an Englishman went to Japan and became a samurai&quot; inspired the novel. &quot;Shogun&quot; was therefore based on an actual series of events involving William Adams, who reached Japan in 1600 and became involved with the future shogun Tokugawa. He achieved high status managing commercial activities for Tokugawa&#x27;s shogunate, though much of the interaction between the various characters in the novel was invented. The first draft was 2,300 pages and Clavell cut it down to 1,700 with the help of his editor, German Gollob. However, &quot;Shogun&quot; was edited lightly in comparison to Clavell&#x27;s earlier novels.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot;‚Ä≥s Webster Schott wrote, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember when a novel has seized my mind like this one [...] It&#x27;s almost impossible not to continue to read &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; once having opened it&quot;. In addition to becoming a best-seller, with more than six million copies of the novel in 14 hardcover and 38 paperback printings by 1980, &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; had great impact on westerners&#x27; knowledge of, and interest in, Japanese history and culture. Henry Smith, editor of &quot;Learning from Sh≈çgun: Japanese History and Western Fantasy&quot; (1980), estimated that 20 to 50% of all students in American college-level courses about Japan had read the novel. He described the book as &quot;a virtual encyclopedia of Japanese history and culture; somewhere among those half-million words, one can find a brief description of virtually everything one wanted to know about Japan&quot;, and stated that &quot;In sheer quantity, &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; has probably conveyed more information about Japan to more people than all the combined writings of scholars, journalists, and novelists since the Pacific War&quot;. Criticizing inaccuracies in the author&#x27;s depiction of Japan, Smith wrote in &quot;History Today&quot; that &quot;Clavell is in effect delivering a sermon on the errant ways of the West&quot;, contrasting Blackthorne and other Christian Westerners&#x27; barbaric ways to the superior &quot;meditative and fatalistic posture of the Japanese samurai&quot;. The author of &quot;James Clavell: A Critical Companion&quot; called the novel &quot;one of the most effective depictions of cross-cultural encounters ever written&quot;, and &quot;Clavell&#x27;s finest effort&quot;.

Clavell said that &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; &quot;is B.C. and A.D. It made me. I became a brand name, like Heinz Baked Beans.&quot; He reported that the ruler of a Middle Eastern petrostate offered him a full oil tanker for a novel that would do for his country what &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; did for Japan.

==Adaptations==
===Television===
In 1976 Clavell employed Robert Bolt to write a screenplay. In 1978, he selected Eric Bercovici to write a miniseries for NBC. Clavell and Bercovici decided to simplify the story for an American television audience by omitting one of the two major plot lines of the novel, the struggle between Toranaga and the other warlords, and focusing on the adventures of Blackthorne and his romance with Mariko. Due to the focus on Blackthorne&#x27;s perspective, most of the Japanese dialogue was not subtitled or dubbed. This nine-hour television miniseries aired in 1980, starring Richard Chamberlain, Toshiro Mifune, Yoko Shimada, and John Rhys-Davies. This was edited into a two-hour theatrical release. A 5-disc DVD release appeared in 2003 and a 3-disc Blu-ray release in 2014.

On August 3, 2018, it was announced that FX would be adapting the novel into a TV series. The 2024 series stars Hiroyuki Sanada, who also served as co-producer, Cosmo Jarvis, Anna Sawai, Tadanobu Asano, Takehiro Hira, Tommy Bastow and Fumi Nikaido.
The trailer was released in late 2023 and the first two episodes premiered on February 27, 2024. In contrast to the 1980 miniseries, this closely follows both plot lines of the novel and translates the dialogue between the Japanese characters, although several characters&#x27; names are changed, for instance, Yabu was changed to Yabushige. Moreover, certain changes were made, including which characters died, as in the show, Nagakado and Hiromatsu (Naga and Hiro-matsu in the books) both died when their book counterparts survived. The series was met with acclaim, with special praise towards Sanada, Jarvis, Sawai, and Asano&#x27;s performances. In May 2024, a second and third season were officially announced to be in development.

This marks the first work to be adapted into two television series resulted to win two Primetime Emmys for two divisions: Outstanding Limited Series in 1981 and Outstanding Drama Series in 2024.

===Stage musical===
A stage musical adaptation, &quot;Sh≈çgun: The Musical&quot;, was produced in 1990.

===Games===
There have been three video games based on the novel. Two text-based adventure games with sparse graphics were produced for the Amiga and PC, marketed as &quot;James Clavell&#x27;s Sh≈çgun&quot; by Infocom and &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot; by Mastertronic. A unique graphical adventure game, &quot;Sh≈çgun&quot;, was also produced for systems including the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and IBM PC by Lee &amp; Mathias and released by Virgin Entertainment in 1986.

The tabletop game publisher FASA published &quot;James Clavell&#x27;s Shogun&quot; in 1983. This was the third of four boardgame titles based on Clavell novels.

A developer of &quot;Wizardry&quot;, one of the RPGs (role playing game) that are considered to have pioneered the gaming genre, admitted that the most powerful weapon in the game called Muramasa Blade was originally spelled as Murasama, as a result of exactly referencing to the sword appeared in the novel.

<text>USS &quot;Texas&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship built by the United States in the early 1890s. The first American battleship commissioned, she was built in reaction to the acquisition of modern armored warships by several South American countries, and meant to incorporate the latest developments in naval tactics and design. This includes the mounting of her main armament &quot;en echelon&quot; to allow maximum end-on fire and a heavily-armored citadel amidships to ensure defensive strength. However, due to the state of U.S. industry at the time, &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s building time was lengthy, and by the time she was commissioned, she was already out of date. Nevertheless, she and the armored cruiser were considered advancements in American naval design.

&quot;Texas&quot; developed a reputation as a jinxed or unlucky ship after several accidents early in her career; she consequently earned the nickname &quot;Old Hoodoo&quot;. These mishaps included problems during construction, a grounding off Newport, Rhode Island, and flooding shortly afterwards while at dock in New York City. In the last, she settled to the bottom with her gun deck awash and several crew members drowned. She also received significant damage to her hull in drydock after being raised. Her reputation improved with her service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, when she blockaded the coast of Cuba and fought in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba.

After the war, &quot;Texas&quot; returned to peacetime duty, interrupted by several refits. She became the station ship in Charleston, South Carolina, by 1908 and was renamed &quot;San Marcos&quot; in 1911 to allow her name to be used by the new battleship BB-35. She became a target ship that same year and was sunk in shallow water in Chesapeake Bay. She was used as a gunnery target throughout World War II and was partially demolished in 1959 because her remains were considered a navigational hazard.

== Design and description ==
=== Background ===
The delivery of the in 1883 and the acquisition of other armored warships by Brazil, Argentina, and Chile shortly afterward alarmed the United States government, as the Brazilian Navy was now the most powerful in the Western Hemisphere. The United States Navy now felt capable only of defending its own ports. The Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, Congressman Hilary A. Herbert characterized the situation thus: &quot;if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by the &quot;Riachuelo&quot; it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port.&quot;

The Navy Advisory Board, confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the American coast, began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884. Both had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major American ports and bases. They had to have a minimum speed of and were to displace about . They were both optimized for end-on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck, much like the battleships &quot;Riachuelo&quot; and . The first ship, laid down for the then-traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four guns, became . The other, armed with two guns, became &quot;Texas&quot;, the first ship named in honor of that state to be built by the United States.

The Navy Department conducted an international design competition for &quot;Texas&quot; and the winner was the Naval Construction &amp; Armaments Co. of Barrow-in-Furness, England. The winning design placed &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s forward turret on the port side and her aft turret to starboard. The need for cross-deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure. This significantly limited the gun&#x27;s ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun&#x27;s arc of fire. Furthermore, neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired, as demonstrated during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when her starboard deck was damaged.

Even five years before &quot;Texas&quot; was complete, the blast effects from end-on fire were considered prohibitive and &quot;en echelon&quot; mounting of main guns was abandoned in European navies and new American builds. This made &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s armament arrangement obsolete. The Bureau of Construction and Repair in conjunction with the newly established Board on Construction, considered a thorough re-design which would have placed &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s main guns on the centerline, either in two single turrets or one twin turret, and the heavy redoubt eliminated. Construction by this time was too far advanced for such a plan, however, and Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy limited the Board to detail improvements.

=== General characteristics ===
&quot;Texas&quot; was long overall. She had a beam of and a maximum draft of . She displaced at full load as built. Her hull had two wing compartments on each side of her machinery spaces as well as a centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separating the engines and boilers. Asymmetric flooding of the wing compartments posed a grave danger to her stability. Her double bottom protected most of her hull and extended up the side to the lower edge of the armor deck. She had a metacentric height of and was fitted with a ram bow.

=== Propulsion ===
&quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s machinery was built by the Richmond Locomotive and Machine Works of Richmond, Virginia. She had two inverted vertical triple-expansion steam engines with a total designed output of , each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by four double-ended cylindrical boilers at a working pressure of . On trials, she reached a speed of , exceeding her contract speed of . She carried a maximum load of of coal. She carried two Edison electric dynamos to power her searchlights and provide interior lighting.

=== Armament ===
&quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s main armament consisted of two /35 caliber Mark I guns mounted in single Mark 2 hydraulically powered turrets inside her armored redoubt. These guns had a maximum elevation of 15¬∞ and could depress to ‚àí5¬∞. Eighty rounds per gun were carried. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of about at maximum elevation. The fixed rammers were below and outside the turrets. Initially, they could only be loaded at one positions, dead-ahead and at 0¬∞ elevation, but they were modified to load at all angles of train just before the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.

Four of the six  guns were mounted in casemates in the hull and the other two were mounted on the main deck in open pivot positions. The two main deck guns were 35-caliber weapons, while the casemate guns were 30-caliber guns. Data is lacking, but they could probably depress to ‚àí7¬∞ and elevate to +12¬∞. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of about . They had a maximum range less than when fired at maximum elevation.

The antitorpedo boat armament consisted of a dozen six-pounder guns (of unknown type) in casemates spaced along the hull. They fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about at a rate of 20 rounds per minute. Their range was less than . Two Hotchkiss five-barrel revolving guns each were mounted on the fore and aft superstructures. In addition, two 37-mm Driggs-Schroeder one-pounder guns were mounted in each fighting top. They fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about to a range about . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute.

&quot;Texas&quot; carried four torpedo tubes, all above water. One tube each was in the bow and stern and another on each side, towards the rear of the hull. She was originally intended to carry two small steam torpedo boats, each with a one-pounder gun, and a trainable torpedo tube, but they were cancelled after the poor performance of the boat built for the &quot;Maine&quot;.

=== Armor ===

The main waterline belt, made of Harvey armor, had a maximum thickness of 12¬†inches and tapered to at its lower edge. It was long and covered the machinery spaces. It was high, of which was above the design waterline. It angled inwards for at each end, thinning to , to provide protection against raking fire. It sloped downwards to meet the top of the protective deck. It was thick and sloped downwards at the ends of the ship. It also sloped downwards to the sides, but its thickness increased to . A 12-inch-thick diagonal armored citadel on the gun deck protected the turret machinery and the supports of the conning tower. The deck above it was two inches thick.

The sides of the circular turrets were 12 inches thick, and they had roofs. The conning tower had walls. Turret hoists, voicepipes and electrical leads were protected by armored tubes. The lateral hydraulic pipes that ran along the underside of the gun deck were initially unprotected, but armored tubes were installed to protect them during &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s 1902 refit. Along the center of the ship, they were one inch thick, but increased to two inches closer to the sides of the ship.

No light armor was fitted above the main belt or at either end of the ship. This made &quot;Texas&quot; highly vulnerable to rapid-fire guns using high-explosive shells. This was not considered a significant threat at the time &quot;Texas&quot; was designed but would become so within a few years.

== Construction ==
&quot;Texas&quot; was authorized by the U.S. Congress on 3 August 1886. The start of construction was delayed for nearly eight months over concerns about her stability and general characteristics. Her keel was laid down on 1 June 1889, at Portsmouth, Virginia, by the Norfolk Navy Yard. She was launched on 28 June 1892, sponsored by Miss Madge Houston Williams, granddaughter of Sam Houston; and commissioned on 15 August 1895, with Captain Henry Glass in command.

== Service ==

=== Early years ===
When drydocked in the New York Navy Yard for the first time after her trials several structural flaws came to light. The floors had buckled their brackets and the cement near the keel had cracked. Her floor brackets were reinforced with angle iron and the cement was repaired. But this raised issues regarding her structural integrity so a Board of Survey in January 1896 was formed to evaluate her condition and suggest improvements. The Board determined that further strengthening of her hull was needed, but the exact measures taken are not known, although they would cost $39,450 and take 100 working days. However, the Board wished to know what effect these changes would have on the draft, stability, and metacentric height of the &quot;Texas&quot;. The Board received a reply on 4 February that they would increase her displacement by , deepen her draft by less than and raise her metacentric height to .

The ship ran aground near Newport, Rhode Island, in September 1896. Operator error combined with signal failure were blamed. A few officers, including future Governor of Guam Alfred Walton Hinds, were publicly reprimanded. While under repairs in New York, the yoke that secured the main injection valve in the starboard engine room broke on 9 November 1896. Water pressure unseated the valve and allowed the compartment to flood as the receiving pipe had earlier been removed for repair. Leaks in the watertight doors, voicepipes and holes in the bulkheads for electrical cables allowed the flooding to spread to the other engine and boiler rooms, the coal bunkers adjacent to them, as well as most of the magazines and shell rooms. The ship settled to the bottom, but the water was so shallow as to aid salvage efforts. By the 11th most of the water had been pumped out, but she was still drawing too much water to enter the drydock. An estimated of coal would have to be removed to lighten &quot;Texas&quot; enough to enter the drydock.

After repairs &quot;Texas&quot; was assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, and patrolled the Eastern Seaboard of the United States. In February 1897, she left the Atlantic for a brief cruise to the Gulf coast ports of Galveston, Texas, and New Orleans. She arrived in Galveston on 16 February 1897 and anchored in of water. The local pilot assured her captain that this was the best berth in the harbor for a ship of &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s length. However a strong tide swung her around onto a mud bank and held there. She was not able to get herself off and even the assistance of the U.S. Revenue Steamer &quot;Galveston&quot; was to no effect. Late the next day she was hauled off by the use of her port anchor and a tug. These two incidents gave her a reputation as being a jinxed or unlucky ship and earned her the nickname &quot;Old Hoodoo&quot;.

She returned to the Eastern Seaboard in March 1897 and remained there until the beginning of 1898. During this period, her bow and stern torpedo tubes were removed in June 1897 and additional telescopic sights were added to her turret roofs between 14 July and 12 August. At the beginning of 1898, she visited Key West, Florida, and the Dry Tortugas &quot;en route&quot; to Galveston for a return visit, which she made in mid-February. Returning to the Atlantic via the Dry Tortugas in March, she arrived in Hampton Roads on 24 March and resumed duty with the North Atlantic Squadron.

=== Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War ===

Early in the spring, war between the United States and Spain erupted over conditions in Cuba and the supposed Spanish destruction of &quot;Maine&quot; in Havana harbor in February 1898. By 18 May, under the command of Captain J. W. Philip, &quot;Texas&quot; was at Key West, readying to prosecute that war.

On 21 May, the battleship arrived off Cienfuegos, Cuba, with the Flying Squadron to blockade the Cuban coast. After a return to Key West for coal, &quot;Texas&quot; arrived off Santiago de Cuba on 27 May. She patrolled off that port until 11 June, when she made a reconnaissance mission to Guant√°namo Bay in support of the Marine landings there. The next day the &quot;Texas&quot; landed three field pieces and two M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine guns at the request of the Marine expeditionary commander, Lt. Col. Robert W. Huntington. For the next five weeks, the &quot;Texas&quot; patrolled between Santiago de Cuba and Guant√°namo Bay. On 16 June, the warship joined the cruiser for a bombardment of the fort on South Toro Cay in Guant√°namo Bay. The two ships opened fire just after 14:00 and ceased fire about an hour and 16¬†minutes later, having reduced the fort to impotency.

On 3 July, she was steaming off Santiago de Cuba when the Spanish Fleet under Admiral Cervera attempted to escape past the American Fleet. &quot;Texas&quot; took four of the enemy ships under fire immediately. While the battleship&#x27;s main battery pounded the armored cruisers and , her secondary battery joined , , and in battering two torpedo-boat destroyers.

&quot;The two Spanish destroyers fell out of the action quickly and beached themselves, damaged heavily. One by one, the larger enemy warships also succumbed to the combined fire of the American Fleet. Each, in turn, sheered off toward shore and beached herself. Thus, &quot;Texas&quot; and the other ships of the Flying Squadron annihilated the Spanish Fleet.&quot; &quot;Texas&quot; was lightly damaged during the battle by a single high explosive shell that hit her on the starboard side above the main deck, immediately forward of the ash hoist. Fragments from the shell badly damaged the ash hoist and destroyed the doors of both air shafts and the adjacent bulkheads. Splinters riddled much of the adjacent structure as well.

&quot;The defeat of Cervera&#x27;s Fleet helped to seal the doom of Santiago de Cuba. The city fell to the besieging American forces on 17 July, just two weeks after the great American naval victory. The day after the surrender at Santiago, Spain sought peace through the good offices of the French government. Even before the peace protocol was signed in Washington, DC, on 12 August, American ships began returning home. &quot;Texas&quot; arrived in New York on 31 July. Captain Philip was promoted to Commodore on 10 August 1898.&quot;

&quot;In late November, &quot;Texas&quot; moved south to Hampton Roads where she arrived on 2 December. The warship resumed her peacetime routine patrolling the Atlantic coast of the United States. Though her primary field of operations once again centered on the northeastern coast, she also made periodic visits to such places as San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Havana, Cuba, where her crew could view some of the results of their own ship&#x27;s efforts in the recent war.&quot;

=== Post-war service ===

&quot;Texas&quot; was decommissioned for a lengthy refit on 3 November 1900 at the Norfolk Navy Yard but was commissioned again on 3 November 1902. During this refit, her funnel and topmasts were raised. Furthermore, the protection for her ammunition hoists was doubled and her broadside torpedo tubes were removed. On one voyage to New Orleans in February 1904, &quot;Texas&quot; could only make under forced draft. During 1904 her armament was upgraded when she exchanged her four /30¬†cal guns for more powerful 35-caliber weapons and two one-pounder guns were landed. She served as flagship for the Coast Squadron until 1905, and remained assigned to it after its commander shifted his flag.

&quot;Texas&quot; was briefly decommissioned between 11 January 1908 and 1 September 1908. By 1908 she had become the station ship at Charleston, South Carolina. By 1910, she had lost her revolving cannon and one more one-pdr gun in exchange for two additional six-pounder guns. Regarded as obsolete by 1911, she was relegated for use as a gunnery target to allow the Navy to evaluate the effects of modern shells on armored and unarmored parts of the ship, the probabilities of underwater hits and their depths, the effects of shock loads on pipes, etc., the flammability of the ship&#x27;s fittings and the direction in which shells were pointing when striking at long range. As part of this evaluation, she was fully fitted out and only items which normally would have been allowed to be removed before action and those items added to her for service as a station ship were removed. Dummies were also rigged to evaluate the effects of hits on the crew. It is uncertain if her ammunition and powder remained on board for the tests. Preparing &quot;Texas&quot; for these tests cost $29,422.70.

=== &quot;San Marcos&quot; ===
&quot;On 15 February 1911, her name was changed to &quot;San Marcos&quot; to allow the name &quot;Texas&quot; to be assigned to Battleship No. 35.&quot; She was sunk in shallow water in Tangier Sound in Chesapeake Bay on 21‚Äì22 March 1911 by gunfire from the battleship . No detailed examination was made afterward, but it was noted that there were so many holes below the waterline that the water in the forward and rear compartments generally took on the motion of the outside water. The interior above the waterline was generally demolished. She was used as a target for a torpedo experiment on 6 April. &quot;On 10 October 1911, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register.&quot; A cage mast, a duplicate of those used on the dreadnoughts, was built atop the &quot;San Marcos&quot;&#x27;s remains in 1912 and tested against shells fired by the monitor from a range of on 21 August 1912. Although the mast had been knocked down by nine hits, it was considered to have withstood the fire exceedingly well.

&quot;San Marcos&quot; was used for gunnery practice throughout World War II, although generally as an anchor for a canvas target screen. Sitting two to six feet below the surface and marked by an unlit buoy, she was responsible for the sinking of the cargo ship &quot;Lexington&quot; in 1940 following a collision. Tons of explosives were used to demolish her upperworks and drive her hull deep into the mud; by January 1959, they were successful and she remains there today.

<text>USS &quot;Texas&quot; (DLGN/CGN-39) was the United States Navy&#x27;s second nuclear guided missile cruiser. She was the third ship of the Navy to be named in honor of the State of Texas. Her keel was laid down on 18 August 1973, at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company.

She was initially designated a guided missile destroyer leader (DLGN), but was reclassified as a guided missile cruiser and given the hull classification symbol CGN-39 on 30 June 1975, as part of the Navy&#x27;s ship reclassification plan. She was launched on 9 August 1975, sponsored by Betty Jane Briscoe, wife of Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe, and commissioned on 10 September 1977.

==Service history==
===1977‚Äì1982===
Following a nine-week test of the ship&#x27;s combat systems, &quot;Texas&quot; loaded weapons at the Yorktown Naval Weapons Station in October and underwent refresher training out of Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, in November. &quot;Texas&quot; spent the first three months of 1978 conducting at-sea evaluation of her propulsion and weapons systems off the Virginia Capes and in the Caribbean. On 28 March, she transited to her building yard at Newport News to commence a Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) which was completed on 31 July. The remainder of 1978 was spent in individual ship exercises off the east coast and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, interspersed with periods in her home port of Norfolk, Virginia.

The maiden deployment of &quot;Texas&quot; was with the Carrier Battle Group (CBG) in the Mediterranean and North Arabian Seas during the Iranian hostage crisis in support of Operation Eagle Claw. She also served as flagship for Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group One. In 1980‚Äì81, during a maintenance period she received two 4-cell Harpoon anti-ship missile batteries and two CIWS gun mounts for anti-missile defense. Her second deployment was again with the &quot;Nimitz&quot; CBG, followed by operations in the Mediterranean. During this period, &quot;Texas&quot; saw combat for the first time, as she responded to Libyan aggression in the Gulf of Sidra.
===1983‚Äì1987===
On 1 March 1983 &quot;Texas&quot; sailed from Norfolk on her third deployment with the Carrier Battle Group (CBG), and included an around-the-world cruise which allowed her to visit every inhabited continent except South America and to sail every ocean except the Arctic. The world cruise also included a change of homeport to San Diego, from Norfolk. &quot;Texas&quot; spent the first part of the following year operating in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea after visits to Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Monaco, Morocco and Cote D&#x27;Ivoire. On 1 July 1983 the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; CBG arrived at Perth, Australia. &quot;Texas&quot;, along with attack submarine arrived at naval base HMAS Stirling in Rockingham, south of Fremantle, where they stayed until the 7 July before &quot;Texas&quot; departed, operating independently from the battle group. Her next port of call was Brisbane, Australia, where she arrived on 14 July 1983. On 19 July, while departing the Fisherman Island Wharf, &quot;Texas&quot; was damaged above the waterline after colliding with the quay, but continued after repairs were made.

On 11 August 1983, anti-nuclear activists marched in Wellington, New Zealand in opposition to a port visit there by &quot;Texas&quot;. The anti-nuclear movement in New Zealand objected to the US policy of not publicizing which of its ships carried nuclear weapons. &quot;Texas&quot; visited Albany, Western Australia, anchoring in King George Sound on 29 August 1983 for an R&amp;R visit. She departed on 1 September 1983, returning to San Diego. She then began to make preparations for a homeport change to Alameda, California then went north to Bremerton, Washington, for a Complex Overhaul. She entered dry-dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in September, and remained there until April 1987.

===1988‚Äì1992===
After Dry Dock in Bremerton Washington she returned to its homeport Alameda, California, &quot;Texas&quot; deployed with the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; Carrier Battle Group (CBG) for Westpac 1988 as the Anti-Air Warfare Commander. This, her fourth major deployment, included port visits to Singapore, Subic Bay, Hawaii, Thailand, Hong Kong and Kenya. In 1989, &quot;Texas&quot; conducted local operations and a short overhaul at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco. By the end of the year, she was back at sea on counter-narcotics operations off the coast of South America.

In February 1991, &quot;Texas&quot; began her sixth deployment, en route to the Arabian Sea. She served during Operation Desert Storm as the command ship for the Anti-Air Warfare Commander of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; CBG. Additionally, she served as a base-ship for minesweeping operations off the coast of Kuwait, providing valuable logistic support for several minesweepers. She returned to San Francisco in August of that year. In April 1992, &quot;Texas&quot; returned to sea and conducted a second counter-narcotics mission that included visits to Ecuador and Panama.

==Early decommissioning==
&quot;Texas&quot; was halfway through her mid-life refueling and New Threat Upgrade overhaul and work had just begun on the installation of her new reactor cores in early May 1993, when the decision was made to cancel the work on her and also the planned refueling of her &quot;Virginia&quot;-class sister-ships. &quot;Texas&quot; was placed in reserve commission on 31 May 1993, then decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 16 July 1993 after just 15 years of service. &quot;Texas&quot; entered the nuclear Ship-Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 1 October 1999.

==Ship&#x27;s Crest==

The official crest of USS &quot;Texas&quot; CGN 39 was designed by Martha Bell, a freelance graphic designer from Texas. The colors‚Äîred, white, and blue‚Äîrepresent the state flag of Texas. The anchor and the fouled line symbolize the Navy, while the Lone Star signifies the state of Texas. The atoms and orbits within the Lone Star represent the nuclear power characteristics of the ship. The three stars at the bottom represent the past United States ships named &quot;Texas&quot;. The motto, &quot;Proud Heritage, Proud Purpose&quot;, refers to the history and legacy of those ships, and their purpose: defense of the United States.

<text>USS &quot;Texas&quot; (SSN-775) is a , and the fourth warship of the United States Navy to be named after the US state of Texas. &quot;Texas&quot; was commissioned as a US Navy warship in Galveston, Texas, on 9 September 2006.

==Construction==
The contract to build her was awarded to the Northrop Grumman Newport News shipyard (then called Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co.) on 30 September 1998 and her keel was laid down on 12 July 2002. She was christened on 31 July 2004 by Laura Bush, First Lady of the United States.
She was launched into the James River on 9 April 2005.

&quot;Texas&quot; arrived at Galveston Bay on 4 September 2006 and was escorted into the harbor by &quot;Elissa&quot;. With a crowd of 10,000 in attendance, &quot;Texas&quot; was commissioned in Galveston and joined the US Atlantic Fleet on 9 September 2006.

==Operational history==
The boat departed New London Naval Submarine Base at Groton for Pearl Harbor on 16 September 2009. On her way to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Texas&quot; traveled to the Arctic Ocean and surfaced near the North Pole&#x27;s ice pack. &quot;Texas&quot; arrived at her new home port on 23 November 2009.

The submarine departed Pearl Harbor for her first three-month operational patrol on 27 October 2010. The location of her first deployment was not disclosed by the Navy. In May 2012, &quot;Texas&quot; underwent a scheduled 20-month-long overhaul at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Hawaii.

&quot;Texas&quot; arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, in September 2020 for repairs and modernization; the work concluded with successful sea trials in December 2024.

== Ship&#x27;s crest ==
&quot;In the forefront is a full view of &quot;Texas&quot;, ready to go forth and take the fight to the enemy. Emblazoned on her hull is the shape of the state of Texas, denoting the outstanding patriotism and leadership the citizens of Texas have contributed to the American nation. Located within the state outline is a symbol of the atom, representing the warfighting capability and endurance afforded &quot;Texas&quot; by nuclear power.

&quot;Texas&quot; is backed by the traditional badge of the Texas Rangers. This identifies the singularity of purpose between the men and women who enforce Texas law and the sailors. The four white stars represent the four American warships to bear the name of the state of Texas. &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas&quot; is a well known state slogan and a warning for those who attempt to prevent &quot;Texas&quot; from carrying out her mission. The battle scarred Lone Star flag flying behind &quot;Texas&quot; represents the gallant heroism of those who fought and died at the Alamo to ensure the future of Texas, and it also represents the perseverance with which &quot;Texas&quot; and her crew will endure through all missions that are put before her.&quot;

==In popular culture==
This commissioning was depicted in Season 2, Episode 4 of the Discovery Channel television series, &quot;FutureWeapons&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Texas&quot; (BB-35) is a museum ship in Galveston and former United States Navy . She was launched on 18 May 1912 and commissioned on 12 March 1914.

&quot;Texas&quot; served in Mexican waters following the &quot;Tampico Incident&quot; but saw no action there, and made numerous sorties into the North Sea during World War I without engaging the enemy, though she did fire for the first time when shooting medium-caliber guns at supposed submarines (no evidence exists that suggests these were anything more than waves). From September 1927 to September 1931, &quot;Texas&quot; became the flagship of the United States Fleet, one of only four ships to be designated U.S. Fleet flagships from 1922 to 1941. In World War II, &quot;Texas&quot; escorted war convoys across the Atlantic and later shelled Vichy French forces in the North African Landings and German-held beaches in the Normandy Landings before being transferred to the Pacific Theater late in 1944 to provide naval gunfire support during the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. She was the only Allied battleship that took part in all four of these amphibious landings. &quot;Texas&quot; was decommissioned in 1948, having earned a total of five battle stars for service in World War II.

&quot;Texas&quot; was also a technological testbed: the first U.S. battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns, the first U.S. warship to control gunfire with directors and range-keepers, the first U.S. battleship to launch an aircraft, and one of the first U.S. Navy warships to receive production radar. She was the first battleship in the world to be outfitted with 14-inch guns.

&quot;Texas&quot; was the first U.S. battleship to become a permanent museum ship; she was turned over to the state of Texas on 21 April 1948 as a permanent museum in Houston. In 1976 she became the first battleship to be declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark, and is the only remaining World War I era dreadnought battleship. She is also one of the seven remaining ships and the only remaining capital ship to have served in both World Wars. &quot;Texas&quot; is owned by the people of Texas and is officially under the jurisdiction of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. Everyday operations and maintenance of &quot;Texas&quot; have been handled by the non-profit organization Battleship Texas Foundation since August 2020. At the end of August 2022 she was moved to a dry dock in Galveston, Texas, to undergo a $60 million repair project. On completion, her new permanent home will be Galveston. As of March 2024, the repair project is still underway, but she has moved out of dry dock.

==Construction==
The United States Congress authorized the construction of &quot;Texas&quot;, the second Navy ship to be named after that state, on 24 June 1910. Bids for &quot;Texas&quot; were accepted from 27 September to 1 December with the winning bid of $5,830,000‚Äîexcluding the price of armor and armament‚Äîsubmitted by Newport News Shipbuilding. The contract was signed on 17 December and the plans were delivered to the building yard seven days later. &quot;Texas&quot; keel was laid down on 17 April 1911 at Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 18 May 1912, sponsored by Miss Claudia Lyon, daughter of Colonel Cecil Lyon, Republican national committeeman from Texas. The ship was commissioned on 12 March 1914 with Captain Albert W. Grant in command.

&quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s main battery consisted of ten /45 caliber Mark 1 guns, which could fire armor-piercing shells to a range of . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty-one /51-caliber guns. She also mounted four torpedo tubes for the Bliss-Leavitt Mark 8 torpedo, one each on the port-side bow and stern and starboard bow and stern. The torpedo rooms held 12 torpedoes total, plus 12 naval defense mines. &quot;Texas&quot; and her sister were the only battleships to store and hoist their 14-inch ammunition in cast-iron cups, nose-down.

==Service history==
On 24 March 1914, &quot;Texas&quot; departed Norfolk Navy Yard and set a course for New York City, making an overnight stop at Tompkinsville, New York, on the night of 26 March. Entering New York Navy Yard on the next day, she spent the next three weeks there undergoing the installation of fire-control equipment.

During his stay in New York, President Woodrow Wilson ordered a number of ships of the Atlantic Fleet to Mexican waters in response to tension created when a detail of Mexican federal troops detained an American gunboat crew at Tampico. The problem was quickly resolved locally, but Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo sought further redress by demanding an official disavowal of the act by the Huerta regime and a 21-gun salute to the American flag.

President Wilson saw in the incident an opportunity to put pressure on a government he felt was undemocratic. On 20 April, Wilson placed the matter before the United States Congress and sent orders to Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, commanding the naval force off the Mexican coast, instructing him to land a force at Veracruz and to seize the customs house there in retaliation for what is now known as the &quot;Tampico Incident&quot;. That action was carried out on 21‚Äì22 April.

Due to the intensity of the situation, &quot;Texas&quot; put to sea on 13 May and headed directly to operational duty without benefit of the usual shakedown cruise and post-shakedown repair period. After a five-day stop at Hampton Roads from 14 to 19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher&#x27;s force off Veracruz on 26 May. She remained in Mexican waters for just over two months, supporting the American forces ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a course for Nipe Bay, Cuba, and from there steamed to New York, where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August.

The battleship remained there until 6 September, when she returned to sea, joined the Atlantic Fleet, and settled into a schedule of normal fleet operations. In October, she returned to the Mexican coast. Later that month, &quot;Texas&quot; became station ship at Tuxpan, a duty that lasted until 4 November, when she steamed for Galveston, Texas. While at Galveston on 7 November, Texas Governor Oscar Colquitt presented the ship&#x27;s silver service to Captain Grant. The Young Men&#x27;s Business League of Waco, Texas, raised the $10,000 to purchase the silver.

&quot;Texas&quot; sailed for Tampico on 14 November and thereafter to Veracruz, where she remained for a month. The ship left Mexico on 20 December and set a course for New York. The battleship entered New York Navy Yard on 28 December and remained there undergoing repairs until 16 February 1915. On 25 May, &quot;Texas&quot;, along with battleships , , and , rescued 230 passengers from the damaged Holland America Line passenger ship , which had been rammed by Norwegian-flagged fruit steamer &quot;Joseph J. Cuneo&quot;. In gratitude, Holland America Line presented &quot;Texas&quot; with a model of a 17th-century warship, which is displayed with the wardroom silver as of 2014. In 1916, &quot;Texas&quot; became the first U.S. battleship to mount anti-aircraft guns with the addition of two /50-caliber guns on platforms atop the boat cranes, and the first to control gunfire with directors and rangefinders, analog forerunners of today&#x27;s computers.

===World War I ===

Upon her return to active duty with the fleet, &quot;Texas&quot; resumed a schedule alternating between training operations along the New England coast and off the Virginia Capes and winter fleet tactical and gunnery drills in the West Indies. That routine lasted just over two years until the February-to-March crisis over unrestricted submarine warfare catapulted the U.S. into World War I in April 1917. The 6 April declaration of war found &quot;Texas&quot; riding at anchor in the mouth of the York River with the other Atlantic Fleet battleships. She remained in the Virginia Capes‚ÄìHampton Roads vicinity until mid-August, conducting exercises and training Naval Armed Guard gun crews for service onboard merchant ships. One of the gun crews trained aboard &quot;Texas&quot; was assigned to the merchant vessel at the beginning of the war. On 19 April, the crew of &quot;Mongolia&quot; sighted a surfaced German U-boat and the gun crew trained aboard &quot;Texas&quot; opened fire on the U-boat, averting an attack on &quot;Mongolia&quot; and firing the first American shots of World War I.

In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, arriving at Base 10 on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port Jefferson that same day. During the mid-watch on 27 September, she ran hard aground on Block Island. Captain Victor Blue and his navigator, confused about shore lights and more concerned about the minefield at the opening of Long Island Sound, made the turn at the wrong time and ran the ship aground on the island from the bow all the way aft beyond midships. For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 September, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damage dictated a return to the yard, and extensive repairs precluded her departure with Battleship Division 9 for the British Isles in November. The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5-inch guns in October 1917. Captain Blue, a protege of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, was never court-martialed and remained in command of &quot;Texas&quot;. The Navy Department held his navigator entirely responsible for the accident.

By December, she had completed repairs and moved south to conduct military simulations out of the York River. Mid-January 1918 found the battleship back at New York preparing for the voyage across the Atlantic, including the removal of two more 5-inch guns, reducing the total number aboard to 16. She departed New York on 30 January 1918, arrived at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland on 11 February, and rejoined Battleship Division 9, by then known as the 6th Battle Squadron of Britain&#x27;s Grand Fleet.

&quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s service with the Grand Fleet consisted entirely of convoy missions and occasional forays to reinforce the British squadron on blockade duty in the North Sea whenever German heavy units threatened. The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the Firth of Forth in Scotland. &quot;Texas&quot; began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the 4th Battle Squadron, then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow the next day and remained until 8 March, when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March. &quot;Texas&quot; and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April, but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American battleships returned to base on 20 April. Four days later, &quot;Texas&quot; again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German High Seas Fleet had sortied from Jade Bay toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units caught sight of the retiring Germans on 25 April, but at such an extreme range, bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet was not possible. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including &quot;Texas&quot;, did likewise on the next.

&quot;Texas&quot; and her division mates passed a relatively inactive May in the Firth of Forth. On 9 June, she got underway with the other warships of the 6th Battle Squadron and headed back to the anchorage at Scapa Flow, arriving there the following day. From 30 June to 2 July, &quot;Texas&quot; and her colleagues acted as escort for American minelayers adding to the North Sea Mine Barrage. After a two-day return to Scapa Flow, &quot;Texas&quot; put to sea with the Grand Fleet to conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games. At the conclusion of those drills on 8 July, the fleet entered the Firth of Forth. For the remainder of World War I, &quot;Texas&quot; and the other battleships of Division¬†9 continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. With the German Fleet increasingly tied to its bases in the estuaries of the Jade and the Ems rivers, the American and British ships settled into a routine schedule of operations with little-to-no hint of combat operations. That state of affairs lasted until the Armistice ended hostilities on 11 November 1918. At 03:35 on 21 November, she got underway to accompany the Grand Fleet to meet the surrendering German Fleet. The two fleets rendezvoused about east of the Isle of May and proceeded to the Firth of Forth. Afterward, the American contingent moved to Portland Harbour, England, arriving there on 4 December.

===Inter-war period===
On 12 December 1918, &quot;Texas&quot; put to sea with Battleship Divisions 9 and 6 to meet President Woodrow Wilson embarked in on his way to the Paris Peace Conference. The rendezvous took place around 07:30 the following morning and provided an escort for the President into Brest, France, where the ships arrived at 12:30 that afternoon. On the afternoon of 14 December, &quot;Texas&quot; and the other American battleships departed Brest to return to the United States. The warships arrived off Ambrose light station on Christmas Day, 1918, and entered New York the next day.

Following overhaul, &quot;Texas&quot; resumed duty with the Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, she became the first American battleship to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship at Guantanamo Bay. Later in 1919 &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet&#x27;s battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, &quot;Texas&quot; served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat &quot;NC-4&quot; to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 &quot;Texas&quot; entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated &quot;BB-35&quot; under the Navy&#x27;s newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.

&quot;Texas&quot; left the Pacific on 16 January 1924 and returned to the east coast for overhaul and to participate in a training cruise to European waters with Naval Academy Midshipmen embarked. While operating in the Atlantic, on 25 November 1924, she sank the incomplete battleship in compliance with the Naval Arms Limitation Treaty of 1922, and later that fall, conducted maneuvers as a unit of the Scouting Fleet. On 31 July 1925, she entered Norfolk Navy Yard for a major modernization overhaul. The overhaul, which replaced both cage masts with tripod masts, replaced her 14 Babcock &amp; Wilcox coal-fired boilers with 6 Bureau Express oil-fired boilers, added anti-torpedo bulges and upgraded her fire-control equipment, was completed on 23 November 1926. Also, her AA armament was increased to eight 3-inch guns, and the torpedo tubes were removed. Six of the 5-inch guns were relocated to new main deck casemates at this time.
Following completion of her overhaul, &quot;Texas&quot; was designated the flagship of the United States Fleet and resumed duty along the eastern seaboard. She kept at that task until late 1927, when she did a brief tour of duty in the Pacific from late September-early December. In 1927, &quot;Texas&quot; set another first with the showing of &quot;talking&quot; pictures for crew entertainment. Near the end of the year, &quot;Texas&quot; returned to the Atlantic and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet. In January 1928, she transported President Calvin Coolidge to Havana, Cuba, for the Pan-American Conference and then continued on via the Panama Canal and the west coast to maneuvers with the fleet near Hawaii.

She returned to New York early in 1929 for her annual overhaul and had completed it by March when she began another brief tour of duty in the Pacific. She returned to the Atlantic in June and resumed normal duty with the Scouting Fleet. In April 1930, she took time from her operating schedule to escort into New York when that ship carried the returning U.S. delegation to the London Naval Conference. In January 1931, she left the yard at New York as flagship of the United States Fleet and headed via the Panama Canal to San Diego, California, and then on to Los Angeles (port of San Pedro) which became her home port for the next six years and three months. There would be a temporary redeployment back to the Atlantic from April to October 1934. During this Pacific period, she served first as flagship for the entire Fleet and, later, as flagship for Battleship Division 1.

In the summer of 1937, she once more was reassigned to the east coast, as the flagship of the Training Detachment, United States Fleet. Late in 1938 or early in 1939, the warship became flagship of the newly organized Atlantic Squadron, built around Battleship Division 5. Through both organizational assignments, her labors were directed primarily to training missions, Midshipman cruises, Naval Reserve drills, and training members of the Fleet Marine Force. Also in 1937, eight  AA guns in two quadruple mounts were added to improve the light AA armament. In December 1938, &quot;Texas&quot; received for testing the first shipborne radar designed and made by a commercial company, RCA, for the U.S. Navy, the 385¬†MHz CXZ. In 1941, &quot;Texas&quot; was one of fourteen ships to receive the RCA CXAM-1 radar.

===World War II===

====Early operations====
Soon after war broke out in Europe in September 1939, &quot;Texas&quot; began operating on the Neutrality Patrol, an American attempt to keep the war out of the Western Hemisphere. Later, as the United States moved toward more active support of the Allied cause, the warship began convoying ships carrying Lend-Lease materiel to the United Kingdom. In February 1941, the U.S. 1st Marine Division was activated aboard &quot;Texas&quot;. On 1 February, Admiral Ernest J. King hoisted his flag as Commander-in-Chief of the re-formed Atlantic Fleet aboard &quot;Texas&quot;. That same year, while on Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic, &quot;Texas&quot; was stalked unsuccessfully by the German submarine .

On Sunday, 7 December 1941, the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleship was at Casco Bay, Maine, undergoing a rest and relaxation period following three months of watch duty at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. After 10 days at Casco Bay, she returned to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942, when she got underway to escort a convoy to England. After delivering her charges, the battleship patrolled waters near Iceland until March when she returned home. At various times in 1942, the secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch guns and the light AA battery was increased, adding two extra 1.1-inch/75-caliber quad mounts (these would be replaced by 10 quad mount Bofors in June 1943) and adding fourteen Oerlikon cannons (increased to 44 by 1944), the attack on Pearl Harbor having demonstrated the need for this. For the next six months, she continued convoy-escort missions to various destinations. On one occasion, she escorted Guadalcanal-bound Marines as far as Panama; on another, the warship screened service troops to Freetown, Sierra Leone, on the west coast of Africa. More frequently, she made voyages to and from the United Kingdom escorting both cargo- and troop-carrying ships.

====Operation Torch====

On 23 October 1942, &quot;Texas&quot; embarked upon her first major combat operation when she sortied with Task Group 34.8 (TG 34.8), the Northern Attack Group for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa. The objective assigned to this group was Port Lyautey in French Morocco. The warships arrived off the assault beaches near the village of Mehedia early in the morning of 8 November and began preparations for the invasion. &quot;Texas&quot; transmitted Lt. General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s first &quot;Voice of Freedom&quot; broadcast, asking the French not to oppose Allied landings on North Africa. When the troops went ashore, &quot;Texas&quot; did not go into action immediately to support them. At that point in the war, the doctrine of amphibious warfare was still embryonic. Many Army officers did not recognize the value of prelanding bombardments. Instead, the Army insisted upon attempting a landing by surprise. &quot;Texas&quot; entered the battle early in the afternoon when the Army requested her to fire upon a Vichy French Army ammunition dump near Port Lyautey. One more gunfire mission was provided on the 10th before the cease fire on 11 November. Thus, unlike in later operations, she expended only 273 rounds of 14-inch shells and six rounds of 5-inch shells. During her short stay, some of her crewmen went ashore to assist in salvaging some of the ships that had been sunk in the harbor. &quot;Texas&quot; was one of only three U.S. battleships ( and &quot;New York&quot;) that took part in Operation Torch. On 16 November, &quot;Texas&quot; departed North Africa for the East Coast of the United States in a task force along with , , , four transports, and seven destroyers.

The young news reporter Walter Cronkite was on board &quot;Texas&quot; starting in Norfolk, Virginia, through her service off the coast of North Africa, and thence back to the US. On the return trip, Cronkite was flown off &quot;Texas&quot; in one of her OS2U Kingfisher aircraft when Norfolk was within flying distance. He was granted permission to be flown the rest of the distance to Norfolk so that he could outpace a rival correspondent on &quot;Massachusetts&quot; to return to the U.S. and to issue the first uncensored news reports to be published about Operation Torch. Cronkite&#x27;s experiences aboard &quot;Texas&quot; launched his career as a war correspondent.

====Operation Overlord====

Throughout 1943, &quot;Texas&quot; carried out the familiar role of convoy escort. With New York as her home port, she made numerous transatlantic voyages to such places as Casablanca and Gibraltar, as well as frequent visits to ports in the UK. That routine continued into 1944 but ended on 22 April of that year when, at the European end of one such mission, she remained at the Clyde estuary in Scotland and began training for the invasion of Normandy.

=====Rehearsal=====
During the next twelve days, &quot;Texas&quot; carried out many 14-inch gun-firing exercises with British battleships and . The firing was done in conjunction with Royal Air Force airplanes as spotters. On 29 April, &quot;Texas&quot;, , and relocated to Belfast Lough, Northern Ireland. There, final preparations were made, including the removal of the airplane catapult and the ship&#x27;s OS2U Kingfisher observation planes. The three pilots who flew &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s Kingfishers during this period were temporarily transferred to a newly formed squadron, VOS-7, that was composed of the pilots who flew observation and scouting planes from the cruisers , , and and the battleships &quot;Arkansas&quot;, &quot;Nevada&quot;, and &quot;Texas&quot;. VOS-7 received training in defensive fighter tactics, aerobatics, navigation, formation flying and spotting procedures in Royal Air Force Spitfires; they flew spotting missions in the Spitfires because of the threat from German fighters. The pilots of VOS-7 would fly spotting missions for the U.S. warships off Omaha and Utah Beaches during D-Day. Also, during this time additional radio equipment was added, including a device to detect and jam radio-guided missiles. Final exercises were carried out to the south in Dundrum Bay and Belfast Lough. During the final preparations, General Eisenhower came aboard on 19 May to speak to the crew. On 31 May, the ship was sealed and a briefing given to the crew about the upcoming invasion. For the invasion, &quot;Texas&quot; was designated Bombardment Force Flagship for Omaha Beach, in the Western Taskforce. Her firing area of Omaha was the western half, supporting the U.S. 29th Infantry Division and the U.S. 2nd Ranger Battalion at Pointe du Hoc, and the U.S. 5th Ranger Battalion, which had been diverted to Western Omaha to support the troops at Pointe du Hoc.

The Omaha Beach bombardment force consisted of two sections with &quot;Texas&quot; and the British light cruiser responsible for the western half with &quot;Arkansas&quot;, and the French light cruisers and responsible for the east. Also assigned to Omaha Beach were the American destroyers , , , , , , , , , and the British destroyers , and . &quot;Texas&quot; was one of only three U.S. battleships (&quot;Arkansas&quot; and &quot;Nevada&quot;) that took part in Operation Neptune (D-Day).

At 02:09 on 3 June, &quot;Texas&quot; and the rest of the Western Taskforce sailed from Belfast Lough for Normandy. In sight, on a parallel course was a group of British ships, including the battleships and &quot;Ramillies&quot;. At 07:10 on 4 June, the taskforce had to reverse course due to unacceptable weather in Normandy. Later that evening, off Lundy Island, the taskforce reversed course and headed for and joined the invasion fleet gathering at Area Z. The invasion fleet then headed south toward Normandy and navigated the German minefield, through which minesweepers had cleared channels; not a single Omaha Beach vessel was lost.

=====D-Day=====
At 03:00 on 6 June 1944, &quot;Texas&quot; and the British cruiser &quot;Glasgow&quot; entered the Omaha Western fire support lane and arrived at her initial firing position offshore near Pointe du Hoc at 04:41, as part of a combined total US-British flotilla of 702 ships, including seven battleships and five heavy cruisers.
The initial bombardment commenced at 05:50, against the site of six guns, atop Pointe du Hoc. When &quot;Texas&quot; ceased firing at the Pointe at 06:24, 255 14-inch shells had been fired in 34 minutes‚Äîan average rate of fire of 7.5 shells per minute, which was the longest sustained period of firing for &quot;Texas&quot; in World War II. While shells from the main guns were hitting Pointe du Hoc, the 5-inch guns were firing on the area leading up to Exit D-1, the route to get inland from western Omaha. At 06:26, &quot;Texas&quot; shifted her main battery gunfire to the western edge of Omaha Beach, around the town of Vierville. Meanwhile, her secondary battery went to work on another target on the western end of &quot;Omaha&quot; beach, a ravine laced with strong points to defend an exit road. Later, under control of airborne spotters, she moved her major-caliber fire inland to interdict enemy reinforcement activities and to destroy batteries and other strong points farther inland.

By noon, the assault on Omaha Beach was in danger of collapsing due to stronger than anticipated German resistance and the inability of the Allies to get needed armor and artillery units on the beach. In an effort to help the infantry fighting to take Omaha, some of the destroyers providing gunfire support closed near the shoreline, almost grounding themselves to fire on the Germans. &quot;Texas&quot; also closed to the shoreline; at 12:23, &quot;Texas&quot; closed to only from the water&#x27;s edge, firing her main guns with very little elevation to clear the western exit D-1, in front of Vierville. Among other things, she fired upon snipers and machine gun nests hidden in a defile just off the beach. At the conclusion of that mission, the battleship attacked an enemy anti-aircraft battery located west of Vierville.

On 7 June, the battleship received word that the Ranger battalion at Pointe Du Hoc was still isolated from the rest of the invasion force with low ammunition and mounting casualties; in response, &quot;Texas&quot; obtained and filled two LCVPs with provisions and ammunition for the Rangers. Upon their return, the LCVPs brought thirty-five wounded Rangers to &quot;Texas&quot; for treatment of whom one died on the operating table. Along with the Rangers, a deceased Coast Guardsman and twenty-seven prisoners (twenty Germans, four Italians, and three French) were brought to the ship. The prisoners were fed, segregated, and not formally interrogated aboard &quot;Texas&quot;, due to the ship bombarding targets or standing by to bombard, before being loaded aboard an LST for transfer to England. Later in the day, her main battery rained shells on the enemy-held towns of Formigny and Tr√©vi√®res to break up German troop concentrations. That evening, she bombarded a German mortar battery that had been shelling the beach. Not long after midnight, German planes attacked the ships offshore, and one of them swooped in low on &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s starboard quarter. Her anti-aircraft batteries opened up immediately but failed to hit the intruder. On the morning of 8 June, her guns fired on Isigny, then on a shore battery, and finally on Tr√©vi√®res once more.

After that, she retired to Plymouth to rearm, returning to the French coast on 11 June. From then until 15 June, she supported the army in its advance inland. By 15 June, the troops had advanced to the edge of &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s gun range; her last fire support mission was so far inland that to get the needed range, the starboard torpedo blister was flooded with water to provide a list of two degrees which gave the guns enough elevation to complete the fire mission. With combat operations beyond the range of her guns on 16 June, &quot;Texas&quot; left Normandy for England on 18 June.

====Battle of Cherbourg====

On the morning of 25 June &quot;Texas&quot;, in company with &quot;Arkansas&quot;, &quot;Nevada&quot;, four cruisers and eleven destroyers, closed in on the vital port of Cherbourg to suppress the fortifications and batteries surrounding the town while the U.S. Army&#x27;s VII Corps attacked the city from the rear. While en route to Cherbourg, the bombardment plan was changed and Task Group 129.2 (TG 129.2), built around &quot;Arkansas&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot;, was ordered to move to the east of Cherbourg and engage the guns of Battery Hamburg, a large shore battery composed of four guns. At 12:08, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was the first to fire at the German positions, while the German gunners waited for &quot;Arkansas&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; to be well in range to return fire. At 12:33, &quot;Texas&quot; was straddled by three German shells; five minutes later &quot;Texas&quot; returned fire with a continuous stream of two-gun salvos. The battleship continued her firing runs in spite of shell geysers blossoming about her and difficulty spotting the targets because of smoke; however, the enemy gunners were just as stubborn and skilled. At 13:16, a German 24-cm shell skidded across the top of her conning tower, sheared the top of the fire control periscope off (the periscope remains fell back into the conning tower and wounded the fire control officer, Lt. Cmdr. Richard B Derickson Jr. and three others), hit the main support column of the navigation bridge and exploded. The explosion caused the deck of the pilot house above to be blown upwards approximately , wrecked the interior of the pilot house, and wounded seven. Of the eleven total casualties from the German shell hit, only one man succumbed to his wounds‚Äîthe helmsman on duty, Christen Christensen. &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s commanding officer, Captain Baker, escaped unhurt and quickly had the bridge cleared. The warship herself continued to deliver her 14-inch shells in two-gun salvos and, in spite of damage and casualties, scored a direct hit that penetrated one of the heavily reinforced gun emplacements to destroy the gun inside at 13:35.

At 14:47, an unexploded 24¬†cm shell was reported. The shell crashed through the port bow directly below the Wardroom and entered the stateroom of Warrant Officer M.A. Clark, but failed to explode. The unexploded shell was later disarmed by a Navy bomb disposal officer in Portsmouth and is currently displayed aboard the ship. Throughout the three-hour duel, the Germans straddled and near-missed &quot;Texas&quot; over sixty-five times, but she continued her mission firing 206 fourteen-inch shells at Battery Hamburg until ordered to retire at 15:01.

====Operation Dragoon====

After &quot;Texas&quot; underwent repairs at Plymouth from damage sustained at Cherbourg, she drilled in preparation for the invasion of southern France. On 16 July, she departed Belfast Lough and headed for the Mediterranean. After stops at Gibraltar and Oran, Algeria, the battleship arrived in Taranto, Italy on 27 July. Departing Taranto on 11 August, &quot;Texas&quot; rendezvoused with three French destroyers off Bizerte, Tunisia, and set a course for the French Riviera. She arrived off Saint-Tropez during the night of 14 August and was joined early the next morning by battleship &quot;Nevada&quot; and cruiser At 04:44 on 15 August, she moved into position for the pre-landing bombardment and, at 0651, opened up on her first target, a battery of five 15¬†cm guns. The beaches had been fortified and heavy resistance was expected. Due to very poor visibility that morning, &quot;Texas&quot; relied on her SG radar equipment to determine her position and track for both navigation and gunnery purposes. No landmarks were visible during the firing and for the greater part of the forenoon.

The heavy opposition that was expected never materialized, so the landing forces moved inland rapidly. As fire support from &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s guns was no longer required, she departed the southern coast of France on the early morning of 17 August. After a stop at Palermo, Sicily, she left the Mediterranean and headed for New York where she arrived on 14 September 1944.

====Operations Detachment and Iceberg====
At New York, &quot;Texas&quot; underwent a 36-day repair period during which the barrels on her main battery were replaced. She replaced all ten of her 14-inch main gun barrels for the third and final time in her career during this refit. In an incredible stroke of luck she was reunited with 9 out of 10 of her original gun barrels that served on &quot;Texas&quot; from 1914 to 1923. These nine guns served with prior to being refurbished, relined, and reinstalled on &quot;Texas&quot; in late 1944. These original guns have remained on &quot;Texas&quot; ever since. After a brief refresher cruise, she departed Maine in November and set a course, via the Panama Canal, for the Pacific. She made a stop at Long Beach, California, and then continued on to Oahu. She spent Christmas at Pearl Harbor and then conducted maneuvers in the Hawaiian Islands for about a month at the end of which she steamed to Ulithi Atoll. She departed Ulithi on 10 February 1945, stopped in the Mariana Islands for two days of invasion rehearsals, and then she set a course for Iwo Jima. She arrived off Iwo Jima on 16 February, three days before the amphibious landings began. She spent just three days pounding the Japanese defenses on Iwo Jima in preparation for the landing of three Marine Corps Divisions. After the Marines stormed the beaches on 19 February, &quot;Texas&quot; switched to providing naval gunfire support for them. &quot;On-call fire&quot; in response to requests from Marine units continued through 21 February.

Though the island of Iwo Jima was not declared to be captured until 16 March, &quot;Texas&quot; departed from the Volcano Islands on 7 March, and returned to Ulithi Atoll to prepare for the invasion of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg). She departed from Ulithi with Task Force 54, the gunfire support unit, on 21 March, and arrived in the Ryukyu Islands on the 26th. &quot;Texas&quot; moved in close to Okinawa and began her prelanding bombardment that same day. For the next six days, she fired multiple salvos from her main guns to prepare the way for several Army and Marine divisions to make their amphibious landings on 1 April.

Each evening, &quot;Texas&quot; retired from her bombardment position close to Okinawa, but returned the next morning to resume her bombardments. The enemy ashore, preparing for a defense-in-depth strategy as at Iwo Jima, made no answer. Only air units provided a response, as several kamikaze raids were sent to harass the bombardment group. &quot;Texas&quot; escaped damage during those attacks. On 1 April, after six days of aerial and naval bombardment, the ground troops went ashore, and for almost two months, &quot;Texas&quot; remained in Okinawan waters providing gunfire support for the troops and fending off the enemy aerial assault. In performing the latter mission, she claimed one kamikaze kill on her own and claimed three assists. &quot;Texas&quot; was at general quarters for over 50 days straight at Okinawa due to the threat of kamikazes. This meant that the crew were at their battle stations at all times for seven weeks and ate only crackers and K-rations for meals and their only resting time was a quick shower and change of clothes every 3 days. &quot;Texas&quot; was never damaged as a result and it is believed that this was the only U.S. ship that stayed at general quarters for such duration at any point during World War II. She fired 2,019 fourteen-inch shells, 2,643 5-inch shells, 490 3-inch shells, 3,100 rounds of 40¬†mm ammunition, and 2,205 rounds of 20¬†mm ammunition during the Okinawa campaign. On 14 May she departed Okinawa for the Philippines.

====End of the war====
On 17 May, &quot;Texas&quot; arrived at Leyte in the Philippines and remained there until after the Japanese capitulation on 15 August. She returned to Okinawa toward the end of August and stayed in the Ryukyu Islands until 23 September. On that day, she set a course for the United States with homeward bound troops embarked as part of Operation Magic Carpet. The battleship delivered her passengers to San Pedro, California on 15 October, and celebrated Navy Day there on 27 October before resuming her mission to bring American troops home. She made two round-trip voyages between California and Oahu in November and a third in late December. On 21 January 1946, &quot;Texas&quot; departed San Pedro and steamed via the Panama Canal to Norfolk where she arrived on 13 February, and soon began preparations for inactivation. On 18 June, she was placed officially in reserve at Baltimore, Maryland.

==Museum ship==
===Battleship &quot;Texas&quot; Commission===
On 17 April 1947, the Battleship &quot;Texas&quot; Commission was established by the Texas Legislature to care for the ship. The $225,000 necessary to pay for towing her from Baltimore to San Jacinto was the Commission&#x27;s first task. On 17 March 1948, &quot;Texas&quot; began her journey to her new anchorage along the busy Houston Ship Channel near the San Jacinto Monument, at San Jacinto State Park, arriving on 20 April, where she was turned over to the State of Texas the next day to serve as a permanent memorial. &quot;Texas&quot; sat just across from the monument at Battleground Park in the waters of the Port of Houston where she was ceremoniously decommissioned on the 21st, nine days later on 30 April 1948 her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. &quot;Texas&quot; was the first permanent battleship memorial museum in the US. was displayed as a floating museum in Portland, Oregon from 1925 to 1941 but was scrapped in 1956. When the battleship was presented to the State of Texas, she was commissioned as the flagship of the Texas Navy.

The funding produced by the Battleship &quot;Texas&quot; Commission was not up to the task of maintaining the ship. Consequently, years of neglect resulted in cracks and gaps in coated surfaces, water intrusion, and steel deterioration. Paint in interior spaces began to crack, then flake, exposing metal surfaces underneath, which began to rust. At the same time, pipes open to the sea ultimately failed, flooding various voids and bunkers.
By 1968, the wooden main deck of the ship was so rotted that rainwater was leaking through the deck into the interior of the ship and pooling in various compartments. The Commission found that replacing the decayed deck timbers would be prohibitively expensive. The solution at the time was to remove the wooden deck and replace it with concrete. The concrete eventually cracked, and again, rainwater began to leak through the main deck into spaces below. In 1971, three local charitable institutions, the Brown Foundation, the Moody Foundation, and the Houston Endowment, together contributed $50,000 to the ship to enable the Commission to sandblast and paint the hull. By this time, newspaper articles reported that &quot;Texas&quot; was &quot;under attack&quot; from neglect and insufficient funding.
Nevertheless, &quot;Texas&quot; was designated a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1975, and a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1976.

===Transfer to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department===
By 1983, concerns with the leadership of the Battleship &quot;Texas&quot; Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983, and TPWD assumed operational control the next day. One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship. The survey revealed that the ship&#x27;s watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing rain water. The architects determined that the ship needed to go to dry dock for major repairs to the hull and to keep rain water from coming through the porous concrete deck. As part of this plan, serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship. After a five-year-long fund-raising campaign, $15 million was collected to dry dock the ship and complete necessary repairs.

===1988‚Äì1990 dry dock period===
On 13 December 1988, &quot;Texas&quot; was pulled from her berth with great difficulty over the course of six hours by six large tugboats to begin the trip from her berth to Todd Shipyards in Galveston, Texas. Once under tow in the Houston Ship Channel she started taking on water, with a serious breach just forward of the engine rooms. The crew had three pumps and two pumps in continuous service to combat the flooding. During the nine-plus hour transit, the ship&#x27;s draft increased by in the stern.

&quot;Texas&quot; entered the yard&#x27;s floating drydock at approximately 22:30 on 13 December, at high tide with only to spare between her hull and the blocks she would sit on. She underwent a 14-month refit that sought to restore the ship to her 1945 condition. While under refit, yard workers sand-blasted paint from not only the hull but also the superstructure and replaced many tons of rusted metal from the hull. Inside the ship, welders and fabricators replaced weakened structural beams and numerous rusted-out deck plates. Topside, workers removed the concrete from the main deck in preparation for a new pinewood deck to be installed later in the refit. In total, more than of steel (amounting to about 15% of the ship&#x27;s hull) were replaced and more than 40,000 rivets were seal-welded on the underwater hull.

On 24 February 1990, tugboats moved &quot;Texas&quot; from dry dock to Brown &amp; Root&#x27;s offshore fabrication facility on Green&#x27;s Bayou for further repairs, and installation of the four mooring attachments on the starboard side of the vessel. Special diamond bit cutting blades had to be used to cut the 4&quot; thick hull steel which was made in Germany and hardened in carbonized beds to reach over 425 HB hardness values according to original blueprints. It was here that the wood deck was also installed and four of the ten mounts of quad 40¬†mm guns were installed. On 26 July, the ship was returned to her berth at San Jacinto where the final six mounts of 40¬†mm guns were installed. The original ten quad 40¬†mm guns of &quot;Texas&quot; were removed in 1948 due to the guns still being actively used by the Navy for many decades after World War II. In an amazing coincidence &quot;Missouri&quot; and other battleships of her class were recalled to active service and due to modernization had to remove all of their 40¬†mm guns in 1986. &quot;Texas&quot; took advantage of this situation to not only get a full complement of ten of the best light anti-aircraft gun mounts of World War II but also then to proceed to repaint and reinterpret the &quot;Texas&quot; to how she looked in the Pacific theater in 1945 with a Measure 21 dark blue paint scheme and no longer the Measure 22 scheme she had worn at Normandy nor the haze gray paint scheme that she later wore in the Atlantic theater and then from 1948 to 1990 before her first dry dock refit. Six to eight of the ten 40¬†mm quad gun mounts that &quot;Texas&quot; received were on &quot;Missouri&quot; until the 1980s. The four old inferior gun mounts that the Navy gave to &quot;Texas&quot; in 1948 were removed. Repairs complete, the ship officially reopened to the public on 8 September 1990. Upon returning to her slip at San Jacinto, members of the ship&#x27;s staff and volunteers worked to restore the interior spaces.

===Dry berth project===

In 2004, after many years of working with many of the stakeholders at the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site evaluating a wide range of alternative plans to address the ship&#x27;s problems, TPWD adopted a Master Plan that called for placing &quot;Texas&quot; into a permanent dry berth. The Texas Legislature was approached to secure appropriate funding. The Legislature allowed the voters of Texas to express their opinion and on 6 November 2007 Texas voters approved $25 million in funds to dry-berth the ship to prevent further deterioration from the corrosive waters of the ship channel.

One of the provisions of the bond legislation was the Battleship Texas Foundation (BTF), a non-profit support organization, raise $4 million in private funds to supplement the $25 million in bond funds. This would provide a total of $29 million to accomplish the goal.

BTF contracted a maritime engineering firm which determined that the ship&#x27;s keel and main supporting internal structure would be sufficiently strong to support the ship in a dry berth, while another maritime engineering firm was also contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives. With these and other studies complete, TPWD presented a progress report to the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) in late July 2008.

In March 2009 the LBB released the funds for the dry berthing project to commence. After a lengthy selection process and fee negotiations, TPWD signed a contract with AECOM, on 26 October 2010, to design and develop the plans for &quot;Texas&quot;‚Ä≥s dry-berth. The contract called for AECOM to have its preliminary design completed by spring 2011, with the bidding process for the construction of the dry berth and temporary mooring of &quot;Texas&quot; to begin in mid-2014, and construction completed by summer 2017. However, by February 2019, funds had not yet been secured to commence construction, with efforts instead dedicated to repairs to the ship.

On 28 May 2019, it was reported that &quot;Texas&quot; would be undergoing $35 million worth of repairs and then be moved further up the Texas coast, largely due to a decline in visitors at its current location. Later that year, &quot;Texas&quot; was closed to the public so necessary preparations could be made for the upcoming restoration process.

===Leaks===

In June 2010, a leak on the starboard side of the ship caused &quot;Texas&quot; to sink two to three feet in her mooring. The leak was precipitated by a burned out pump, which allowed the ship to take on more water than usual. Consequently, a seam separation was pulled below the waterline creating a second leak. Once the leak was discovered, the broken pump was replaced. 105,000 U.S. gal (400,000 L; 87,000 imp gal) of water had to be pumped from the ship.

On 9 June 2012 about 30 new leaks, between holes and gaps, were discovered, ultimately necessitating a three-week closure of the ship to visitors; removal of water and repair was complicated by the presence of residual oil in the ship&#x27;s fuel bunkers. In less than a month, the leaks were fixed.

On 12 June 2017, a hole about below the waterline caused the ship to list six degrees to starboard. After emergency repairs, crews pumped out about 105,000 U.S. gal (400,000 L; 87,000 imp gal) of water per minute out of the ship for more than 15 hours.

===2022 dry dock period===

On 31 August 2022, &quot;Texas&quot; was towed out of her berth to a floating dry dock at Gulf Copper Dry Dock &amp; Rig Repair in Galveston for repairs. The journey took four tugboats pulling the ship through the Houston Ship Channel and ended at around 4 pm. Gulf Copper&#x27;s old dry dock was no longer usable so, in order to find a quick affordable option for their client &quot;Texas&quot;, they found a sunken dry dock, a very large 42-year-old dry dock that sank off of the Bahamas, that they had to salvage by repairing it after raising it from the seafloor and then cutting its length in half due to heavy damage from its sinking. The first vessel to use this recycled dry dock was &quot;Texas&quot;.

Once repairs are complete, the Battleship Texas Foundation intends to berth the ship at a different city; Galveston and many other Texas cities are interested but in March 2023, Baytown and Beaumont were told by the foundation that they were no longer under consideration. As part of the conditions for receiving the $35 million from the Texas government, &quot;Texas&quot; can only be berthed in the upper coast region of Texas after she is repaired, meaning any part of the Texas coastline from the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge to the Louisiana border. &quot;Texas&quot; also received a matching $35 million federal grant from the United States government for her repairs. This $70 million can only be used to repair the battleship and cannot be used on cosmetic-related maintenance like replacing the wooden deck and painting the ship. Also, infrastructure-related projects for the new homeport such as the parking lot or museum buildings cannot be paid for by these funds. &quot;Texas&quot; later received $25 million more in funding for repairs from the Texas government in 2023.
In November 2023, the Port of Galveston board of trustees approved Galveston to become the new home for &quot;Texas&quot;. Her new home will be at Pier 20 in Galveston and rent will be $480,000 per year. She left dry dock on 5 March 2024 but will receive more repairs while afloat for the next 18 to 24 months to her superstructure, smaller guns, and interior spaces.

As of January 2025, &quot;Texas&quot; is still under repair but offering restoration tours every Sunday. The Battleship Texas Foundation expects a grand reopening sometime in 2025. 

===Commemoration===
&quot;Texas&quot; was the first and oldest of the eight U.S. battleships that became permanent floating museums; the other battleships honored in this way are &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, , , , , , and . &quot;Texas&quot; is also one of the oldest surviving modern naval ships, having turned 100 years old on 12 March 2014.

Radio commemorations occur on &quot;Texas&quot; yearly during Museum Ship Weekend and Pearl Harbor Day. Amateur radio operators from the Battleship Texas Amateur Radio operate on those two occasions under the Federal Communications Commission callsign NA5DV, similar to the original callsign NADV.

The Texas Legislature designated the battleship Texas as the official &quot;State Ship of Texas&quot; in 1995.

==Media==

&quot;Texas&quot; has appeared in several films prior to and since her retirement. Her cinema debut, though brief, was in the final scene of the 1937 film &quot;Boy of the Streets&quot; starring Jackie Cooper and Maureen O&#x27;Conner. The 1966 Steve McQueen film &quot; The Sand Pebbles&quot; shot some scenes aboard the ship, but these were removed from the final cut of the movie and subsequently lost. For the 2001 film &quot; Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot; was chosen as a filming location because she is the only surviving American battleship that was built and in service prior to 1941, and her exterior and interior components look very similar to other battleships that were built in the 1910s and 1920s and were present on Battleship Row during the attack. Numerous exterior and interior shots were filmed on &quot;Texas&quot;, with actors using the main deck and numerous interior areas. The interior scenes of the aircraft carrier were also shot inside &quot;Texas&quot;. For the 2006 films &quot; Flags of Our Fathers&quot; and &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; actual film footage of the exterior of &quot;Texas&quot; taken by the film crew were used to depict her fighting at Iwo Jima. Close-up shots of actors manning the smaller guns of &quot;Texas&quot; also were used. The only thing added in post-production was computer-generated imagery depicting the main turrets turning and firing.

&quot;Texas&quot; appears as a multiplayer map for &quot;Call of Duty: Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty: WWII&quot;. Players fight on the deck of the ship as it is at sea during World War II.

<text>The term Down Under is a colloquialism differently construed to refer to Australia and New Zealand, or the Pacific island countries collectively. The term originally referred solely to Australia and gradually expanded in scope. It comes from the fact that Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere, &quot;below&quot; almost all other countries on the usual arrangement of a map or globe which places cardinal north at the top.

The term has been in use since the late 19th century, and the persistence of the media use of the term has led to its wide acceptance and usage, especially in reference to Australia. The Men at Work song &quot;Down Under&quot; became a patriotic rallying song for Australians. The Russian-Australian boxing champion Kostya Tszyu was nicknamed &quot;The Thunder from Down Under&quot;, as is Australian snooker player Neil Robertson. When the then Miss Australia Jennifer Hawkins was crowned as Miss Universe 2004 in Quito, Ecuador, she was called by the same nickname by host Billy Bush.

According to American film critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek &quot;Glossary of Movie Terms&quot;, the &quot;Down Under Rule&quot;:
The Tour Down Under is a cycling race in and around Adelaide, South Australia, and since 2009 has been the inaugural event of the UCI World Tour Ranking calendar, which culminates in the Giro di Lombardia.

<text>John Cowan Hartford (December 30, 1937 ‚Äì June 4, 2001) was an American folk, country, and bluegrass composer and musician known for his mastery of the fiddle and banjo, as well as for his witty lyrics, unique vocal style, and extensive knowledge of Mississippi River lore. His most successful song is &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;, which won three Grammy Awards and was listed in &quot;BMI&#x27;s Top 100 Songs of the Century&quot;. Hartford performed with a variety of ensembles throughout his career, and is perhaps best known for his solo performances where he would interchange the guitar, banjo, and fiddle from song to song. He also invented his own shuffle tap dance move, and clogged on an amplified piece of plywood while he played and sang.

He was posthumously inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Early life==
Harford (he changed his name to Hartford later in life on the advice of Chet Atkins) was born on December 30, 1937, in New York City to parents Carl and Mary Harford. He spent his childhood in St.¬†Louis, Missouri, where he was exposed to the influence that shaped much of his career and music: the Mississippi River. From the time he got his first job on the river, at age 16, Hartford was on, around, or singing about the river.

His early musical influences came from the broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry and included Earl Scruggs, nominal inventor of the three-finger bluegrass style of banjo playing. Hartford said often that the first time he heard Earl Scruggs pick the banjo, it changed his life. By age 13, Hartford was an accomplished old-time fiddler and banjo player, and he soon learned to play guitar and mandolin as well. Hartford performed with his first bluegrass band while attending John Burroughs School, a local private high school.

After high school, he enrolled at Washington University in St. Louis, completed four years of a commercial arts program and dropped out to focus on music; however, he did receive a degree in 1960. He immersed himself in the local music scene, working as a DJ, playing in bands, and occasionally recording singles for local labels.

==Music career==

In 1965, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, the center of the country music industry. In 1966, he signed with RCA Victor and produced his first album, &quot;Looks at Life&quot;, in the same year.

In 1967, Hartford&#x27;s second album &quot;Earthwords &amp; Music&quot; spawned his first major songwriting hit, &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;. His recording of the song was only a modest success, but it caught the notice of Glen Campbell, who recorded his own version, which gave the song much wider publication. At the 1968 Grammys, the song netted four awards, two of which went to Hartford. It became one of the most widely recorded country songs of all time, and the royalties it brought in allowed Hartford great financial independence; Hartford later said that the song bought his freedom.

As his popularity grew, he moved to the West Coast, where he became a regular on &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;; other television appearances followed, as did recording appearances with several major country artists. Hartford played banjo and sang the vocal harmonies on the Guthrie Thomas song &quot;I&#x27;ll be Lucky&quot;. He also played with The Byrds on their album &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;.

His success on the Smothers Brothers series was enough that Hartford was offered the lead role in a TV detective series, but he turned it down to move back to Nashville and concentrate on music. He also was a regular on &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot; (as the banjo picker who would stand up from his seat in the audience to begin the theme music) and &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;.

In live performances, John Hartford was a true one-man band; he used several stringed instruments and a variety of props such as plywood squares and boards with sand and gravel for flatfoot dancing.

===Newgrass===
Hartford recorded four more albums for RCA from 1968 to 1970: &quot;The Love Album&quot;, &quot;Housing Project&quot;, &quot;John Hartford&quot;, and &quot;Iron Mountain Depot&quot;. In 1971, he moved to Warner Bros. Records, where he was given more freedom to record in his nontraditional style, fronting a band that included Vassar Clements, Tut Taylor, and Norman Blake. He recorded several albums that set the tone of his later career, including &quot;Aereo-Plain&quot; and &quot;Morning Bugle&quot;. Sam Bush said, &quot;Without &quot;Aereo-Plain&quot; (and the Aereo-Plain band), there would be no newgrass music.&quot;

He switched to the Flying Fish label several years later and continued to experiment with nontraditional country and bluegrass styles. Among his recordings were two albums in 1977 and 1980 with Doug and Rodney Dillard from The Dillards, with Sam Bush as a backing musician and featuring a diversity of songs that included &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman&quot; and &quot;Yakety Yak&quot;. Hartford&#x27;s Grammy-winning &quot;Mark Twang&quot; features Hartford playing solo, reminiscent of his live solo performances playing the fiddle, guitar, banjo, and amplified plywood for tapping his feet. At the same time, he developed a stage show, which toured in various forms from the mid 1970s until shortly before his death.

Hartford changed recording labels several more times during his career; in 1991, he inaugurated his own Small Dog a&#x27;Barkin&#x27; label. Later in the 1990s, he switched again to Rounder Records. He recorded a number of idiosyncratic records on Rounder, many of which recalled earlier forms of folk and country music. Among them was the 1999 album &quot;Retrograss&quot; recorded with Mike Seeger and David Grisman, with bluegrass versions of &quot;(Sittin&#x27; on) the Dock of the Bay&quot;, &quot;Maybellene&quot;, &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, and &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot;.

He recorded several songs for the soundtrack to the movie &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, winning another Grammy for his performance. He made his final tour in 2000 with the Down from the Mountain tour that grew out of that movie and its accompanying album. While performing in Texas in April, he found that he could no longer control his hands due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which ended his life two months later.

Hartford is considered a co-founder of the newgrass movement, although he remained deeply attached to traditional music as well. His last band and last few albums reflect his love for pre-bluegrass old-time music.

==Steamboating==
The culture of the Mississippi River and its steamboats captivated Hartford from an early age. He said that it would have been his life&#x27;s work &quot;but music got in the way&quot;, so he intertwined them whenever possible. In the &#x27;70s, Hartford earned his steamboat pilot&#x27;s license, which he used to keep close to the river he loved; for many years, he worked as a pilot on the steamboat &quot;Julia Belle Swain&quot; during the summers. He also worked as a towboat pilot on the Mississippi, Illinois, and Tennessee Rivers.

During his later years, he came back to the river every summer. &quot;Working as a pilot is a labor of love&quot;, he said. &quot;After a while, it becomes a metaphor for a whole lot of things, and I find for some mysterious reason that if I stay in touch with it, things seem to work out all right&quot;. His home in Madison, Tennessee, was situated on a bend of the Cumberland River and built to simulate the view from a steamboat deck. He used to talk to the boat captains by radio as their barges crawled along the river. That bend of the Cumberland River, known as &quot;Hartford&#x27;s Bend&quot; or &quot;John Hartford Point&quot;, is denoted on official navigational charts with the &quot;John Hartford Light&quot;.

An accomplished fiddler and banjo player, Hartford was simultaneously an innovative voice on the country scene and a reminder of a vanished era. Along with his own compositions, such as &quot;Long Hot Summer Days&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Pool&quot;, Hartford was a repository of old river songs, calls, and stories. His song &quot;Let Him Go on Mama&quot; from Mark Twang was inspired by retired Streckfus Steamers musician (and later chief engineer of the Delta Queen) Mike O&#x27;Leary. Hartford was also the author of &quot;Steamboat in a Cornfield&quot;, a children&#x27;s book that recounts the true story of the Ohio River steamboat &quot;The Virginia&quot; and its beaching in a cornfield.

==Final years and legacy==
Between 1995 and 2001, Brandon Ray Kirk and he co-authored a biography of blind fiddler Ed Haley. Hartford&#x27;s album &quot;The Speed of the Old Longbow&quot; is a collection of Haley&#x27;s tunes. Writer and arts administrator Art Menius profiled Hartford in the &quot;Academia&quot; journal article, &quot;John Hartford as I Knew Him&quot;, saying &quot;John connected not just words to music, but the old days of Nashville to its present, tradition to
innovation, new grass to bluegrass to old-time, television to radio, river to shore, aging musicians to hippies. Goethe may have been the last person to know everything worth knowing, but John Hartford tried.&quot; Hartford also provided voice acting for the Ken Burns&#x27; documentary series &quot;Baseball&quot; and &quot;The Civil War&quot;.

From the 1980s onwards, Hartford had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He died of the disease at Centennial Medical Center in Nashville, on June 4, 2001, at age 63. He is interred at Spring Hill Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee. Hartford was given a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame in honor of his work. He also was given a posthumous president&#x27;s award by the Americana Music Association in September 2005. The annual John Hartford Memorial Festival was held in southern Indiana from 2011 to 2019 and in 2022.

Hartford acknowledged that the royalties he earned from &quot;Gentle&quot; allowed him to live the life he wanted as a musician, author, folklorist and steamboat pilot. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; commented that &quot;his song about freedom ensured his own freedom.&quot;

==Personal life==
Hartford was initially married to Betty and later to Marie, who survived him. He has a son and daughter.

==Works==
Hartford recorded more than 30 albums, ranging across a broad spectrum of styles, from the traditional country of his early RCA recordings, to the new and experimental sound of his early newgrass recordings, to the traditional folk style to which he often returned later in his life. Hartford&#x27;s albums also vary widely in formality, from the stately and orderly &quot;Annual Waltz&quot; to the rougher and less cut recordings that typified many of his later albums.

&quot;Aereo-Plain&quot; and &quot;Morning Bugle&quot; are often considered to be Hartford&#x27;s most influential works, coming as they did at the beginning of a period in which artists such as Hartford and the New Grass Revival, led by Sam Bush, would create a new form of country music, blending their country backgrounds with influences from a number of other sources. His later years had a number of live albums, as well as recordings that explored the repertoire of old-time folk music. He sketched the cover art for some of his midcareer albums, drawing with both hands simultaneously.

Hartford is also a published author, including 1971&#x27;s collection of poetry &quot;Word Movies&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat in a Cornfield,&quot; a poetic retelling of a steamboat running aground along the Ohio River.

==In popular culture==
His song &quot;This Eve of Parting&quot;, from the 1968 album &quot;The Love Album&quot;, was featured in the 2017 movie &quot;Lady Bird&quot;, portions being heard at two different points in the film.

Cartoonist Jim Scancarelli was a fan, and mentioned Hartford several times in his strip &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;. In 1991, a flood washes up a steamboat carrying Hartford; in 1998, he played at Rufus and Melba&#x27;s wedding reception; and in 2002, when Skeezix and Slim are lost in a cemetery, Hartford&#x27;s gravestone is seen.

The third track on the album &quot;A Tear in the Eye Is a Wound in the Heart&quot; by the band Black Prairie, of Portland, Oregon, is entitled &quot;For the Love of John Hartford&quot;, an instrumental.

<doc id="188082" wikidata="Q1764282" url="?curid=188082" title="Balasagun">
<text>Balasagun ( or &quot;Balasagyn&quot;; ) was an ancient Sogdian city in modern-day Kyrgyzstan, located in the Ch√ºy Valley between Bishkek and the Issyk-Kul lake. Located along the Silk Road, the ruins of the city were inscribed in 2014 on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang&#x27;an-Tianshan Corridor World Heritage Site.

Balasagun was founded by the Sogdians, a people of Iranian origin and the Sogdian language was still in use in this town until the 11th century.

It was the capital of the Kara-Khanid Khanate from the 10th century until it was taken by the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty) in 1134. It was then captured by the Mongols in 1218. The Mongols called it Gobalik &quot;Pretty City&quot;. It should not be confused with Karabalghasun, now Ordu-Baliq in Mongolia, which was the capital of the Uyghur Khaganate.

Founded by the Kara-Khanid Khanate in the ninth century, Balasagun soon supplanted Suyab as the main political and economical centre of the Ch√ºy Valley; its prosperity declined after the Mongol conquest. The poet Y≈´suf Balasaguni, known for writing the &quot;Kutadgu Bilig&quot;, is thought to have been born in Balasagun in the 11th century. The city also had a sizable Nestorian Christian population; one graveyard was still in use in the 14th century. Since the 14th century, Balasagun is a village with plenty of ruins southeast of Tokmok.

The Burana zone, located at the edge of Tokmok and from the present village of Balasagun, was the west end of the ancient city. It includes the Burana Tower and a field of stone petroglyphs, the Kurgan stelae. The Burana Tower is a minaret built in the 11th century on the ruins of the ancient city Balasagun. It is in height, though when it was first built it topped . Several earthquakes through the centuries caused much damage, and the current building represents a major renovation carried out in the 1970s.

<doc id="188083" wikidata="Q85770132" url="?curid=188083" title="Islam in the African diaspora">
<text>The practice of Islam by members of the African diaspora may be a consequence of African Muslims retaining their religion after leaving Africa (as for many Muslims in Europe) or of people of African ethnicity converting to Islam, as among many African-American Muslims, where conversion is often presented as a recovery of an African heritage lost during the Atlantic slave trade. In many regions, African-diaspora Muslims are an intersectional minority, and may face both racism and anti-Islam sentiment.

== Background ==
Islam has existed in Africa for a long time. It first arrived in North Africa up until around the 8th century when the religion began to spread south and west. It spread across sub-saharan Africa since the 8th century onwards, where Islam is the majority or significant minority religion in many modern countries. The states that Islam was able to spread through and begin to influence were in West Africa (including places like Senegal, Gambia, Niger, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Nigeria). It is even seen today in many of those countries that there is still that presence and some influence of Islam. Researchers also believe that it is very likely that Islam was able to spread into Africa due to trade throughout the Mediterranean Sea and trans-Saharan routes. It is a known fact that throughout history trade has been one of the biggest forms of communication and a very useful pathway as people trade more than just goods, but also practices and religious traditions that others tend to adopt. 

Aside from just trade as the most popular way that Islam made its way into Western Africa, there were also religious teachers or even Islamic missionaries that were looking to spread their faith, often as a side effect of engaging in trade or working with local polities. Without all of this trade, Islam would not have been able to spread to the vast number of people it did in Africa and in turn not make its influence on the people and other religions of that area.

An article by the Lowcountry Digital History Initiative mentioned how some of these northern and west African kings converted to Islam themselves when the spreading happened, and those that did not convert were completely fine with allowing others to practice this newly introduced religion. The article goes on to mention that the mass number of conversions to Islam would not end up happening until much later around the 17th century. It continues on explaining how as more and more people converted, new practices were developed and some older ones were left behind. In other words, as the religion grew it began to change and evolve into one that more and more people wanted to be a part of. They were able to make some changes that made more sense to them and keep the religion intriguing and popular within the newer countries.

== History ==
It is very well known that many religious practices and other African traditions and ways of life were brought to America through the slave trade. Islam is no special case, as the religion was brought from Africa to the Caribbean and the United States in the exact same way. An article by Enslaved and Freed African Muslims: Spiritual Wayfarers in the South and Lowcount, anywhere from fifteen to thirty percent of the enslaved people that were brought to the Americas through the slave trade practiced some form of Islam and shared in their religious practices. Because of facts like this, claims can be made that this is how Islam first got the Americans and how it was able to grow and infiltrate its practices and ideas into other slaves who may not have come from those same western African countries. As stated earlier Islam spread throughout west Africa and influenced some of the other practices in those religions which would lead to even more influence from Islam once those people with their religions were forced to come to the Americas.

The slave trade would be the reason for the first strong presence of Muslims and Islam in the United States. These slaves continued to practice and preach their traditions and ways of life and pass them on to their friends and families growing the culture and religion. These same Lowcountry articles continue to go on and talk about how Americans today only picture middle eastern people and even the violent terrorist groups that come from some of those counties when thinking about Islam. But in reality, Islam had been in this country for so many years prior to these groups and stereotypes and that people tend to forget about how Islam arrived in this country in the first place. Without the first presence of Muslims coming from the slave trade, it is very unlikely that Islam would have been able to spread and have an influence as much as it does in the country today. Islam was likely an escape for these slaves as it was something from their home and roots that they could continue to practice and live through to keep their heritage and beliefs alive.

<text>USS &quot;Arizona&quot; was a standard-type battleship built for the United States Navy in the mid-1910s. Named in honor of the 48th state, she was the second and last ship in the . After being commissioned in 1916, &quot;Arizona&quot; remained stateside during World War I but escorted President Woodrow Wilson to the subsequent Paris Peace Conference. The ship was deployed abroad again in 1919 to represent American interests during the Greco-Turkish War. Two years later, she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet, under which the ship would remain for the rest of her career.

The 1920s and 1930s saw &quot;Arizona&quot; regularly deployed for training exercises, including the annual Fleet Problems, excluding a comprehensive modernization between 1929 and 1931. The ship supported relief efforts in the wake of a 1933 earthquake near Long Beach, California, and was later filmed for a role in the 1934 James Cagney film &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot; before budget cuts led to significant periods in port from 1936 to 1938. In April 1940, the Pacific Fleet&#x27;s home port was moved from California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as a deterrent to Japanese imperialism.

On 7 December 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and &quot;Arizona&quot; was hit by several air-dropped armor-piercing bombs. One detonated an explosive-filled magazine, sinking the battleship and killing 1,177 of its officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships attacked that day, &quot;Arizona&quot; was so irreparably damaged that it was not repaired for service in World War II. The shipwreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor beneath the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial. Dedicated to all those who died during the attack, the memorial is built across the ship&#x27;s remains.

== Description ==
The &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;-class ships were significantly larger than their predecessors, the . &quot;Arizona&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of (at the waterline), and a draft of at deep load. This was longer than the older ships. She displaced at standard and at deep load, over more than the older ships. The ship had a metacentric height of at deep load. Her crew numbered 56 officers and 1,031 enlisted men as built.

The ship had four direct-drive Parsons steam turbine sets, each of which drove a propeller in diameter using steam provided by twelve Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , but achieved only during &quot;Arizona&quot;‚Ä≥s sea trials, when she met her designed speed of . However, she did manage to reach during a full-power trial in September 1924. She was designed to carry enough fuel oil to steam at a speed of for with a clean bottom. She had four turbo generators.

&quot;Arizona&quot; carried twelve 45-caliber 14-inch guns in triple gun turrets. The turrets were numbered from I to IV from front to rear. Defense against torpedo boats was provided by twenty-two 51-caliber guns mounted in individual casemates in the sides of the ship&#x27;s hull. Positioned as they were they proved vulnerable to sea spray and could not be worked in heavy seas. The ship mounted four 50-caliber guns for anti-aircraft defense, although only two were fitted when completed. The other pair was added shortly afterwards on top of Turret III. &quot;Arizona&quot; also mounted two torpedo tubes underwater, one on each broadside, and carried 24 torpedoes for them.

The &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;-class design continued the all-or-nothing principle of armoring only the most important areas of the ship begun in the &quot;Nevada&quot; class. The waterline armor belt of Krupp armor measured thick and covered only the ship&#x27;s machinery spaces and magazines. It had a total height of , of which was below the waterline; beginning below the waterline, the belt tapered to its minimum thickness of . The transverse bulkheads at each end of the ship ranged from 13 to 8¬†inches in thickness. The faces of the gun turrets were thick while the sides were thick and the turret roofs were protected by of armor. The armor of the barbettes was thick. The conning tower was protected by of armor and had a roof eight inches thick.

The main armor deck was three plates thick with a total thickness of 3 inches; over the steering gear the armor increased to in two plates. Beneath it was the splinter deck that ranged from in thickness. The boiler uptakes were protected by a conical mantlet that ranged from in thickness. A three-inch torpedo bulkhead was placed inboard from the ship&#x27;s side and the ship was provided with a complete double bottom. Testing in mid-1914 revealed that this system could withstand of TNT.

== Construction and trials ==
The keel of battleship number 39 (hull number: BB-39) was laid on the morning of 16 March 1914 with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt in attendance. The builders intended to set a world-record ten months between the ship&#x27;s keel-laying and launch, for what &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared would be &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest and most powerful, both offensively and defensively, superdreadnought ever constructed,&quot; but the ship was only a little over half complete a year later. She was launched on 19 June 1915, making it about fifteen months from keel-laying to launch. In the meantime, the ship was named after the newest state in the union by Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that 75,000 people attended the launch, including John Purroy Mitchel, the mayor of New York City, George W. P. Hunt, the governor of Arizona, and many high-ranking military officials. Several warships were also nearby, including many of the new dreadnoughts which had already entered service (, , , , , and ). Esther Ross, the daughter of W. W. Ross of Prescott, Arizona, was given the honors of ship sponsor and christening. To acknowledge a ban on alcohol recently passed by the state legislature, the state&#x27;s governor decided that two bottles would be used: one full of sparkling wine from Ohio, and another filled with water from the Roosevelt Dam. After the launch, &quot;Arizona&quot; was towed to the Brooklyn Navy Yard for fitting-out.

&quot;Arizona&quot; was commissioned into the Navy on 17 October 1916 with Captain John McDonald in command. She departed New York on 10 November 1916 after the crew had cleaned the ship and the propulsion system had been tested at the dock. After declinating the ship&#x27;s magnetic compasses, the ship sailed south for her shakedown cruise. Outside Guantanamo Bay, a stripped turbine on 7 December forced the navy to order &quot;Arizona&quot; back to New York for repairs, although she was able to enter Chesapeake Bay to test her main and secondary gun batteries on 19‚Äì20 December. The turbine could not be repaired inside the ship, so the yard workers had to cut holes in the upper decks to lift the damaged casing out. It was reinstalled after almost four months of repairs at the naval yard.
== World War I ==

&quot;Arizona&quot; left the yard on 3 April 1917, and three days later, the United States declared war on Germany. Assigned to Battleship Division¬†8 operating out of the York River, &quot;Arizona&quot; was employed only as a gunnery training ship for the crewmen on armed merchant vessels crossing the Atlantic in convoys. Shortly after the war began, eight of her 5-inch guns (the four guns farthest forward and the sternmost four guns) were removed to equip merchant ships. When the ship sailed near the wreck of the old &quot;San Marcos&quot; (ex-&quot;Texas&quot;), the wreck was sometimes used as a target for the 14-inch guns. &quot;Arizona&quot; rarely ventured into the ocean for fear of U-boats, and when she did, it was only in the company of other battleships and escort ships. Four coal-fired American dreadnoughts (it was easier to obtain coal than oil in the United Kingdom) were eventually sent across the Atlantic in December 1917 as Battleship Division Nine, but &quot;Arizona&quot; was not among them. Life for &quot;Arizona&quot;‚Ä≥s crew was not all training, as the race-boat team from &quot;Arizona&quot; was able to win the Battenberg Cup in July 1918 by beating the team from by three lengths over the three-mile course.

The fighting ended on 11 November 1918 with an armistice. A week later, the ship left the United States for the United Kingdom, arriving on 30 November 1918. After two weeks berthed at Portland Harbor in Dorset, &quot;Arizona&quot; sailed for France. On 13 December 1918, &quot;Arizona&quot; joined nine battleships and twenty-eight destroyers escorting President Woodrow Wilson on the ocean liner into Brest for one day on Wilson&#x27;s journey to the Paris Peace Conference. The ten battleships departed France the next day, taking less than two weeks to cross the Atlantic, and arrived in New York on 26 December to parades, celebrations, and a full naval review by Secretary Daniels. &quot;Arizona&quot; was the first in line and rendered a nineteen-gun salute to Daniels. Along with many of the other members of the recently returned fleet, she was anchored off New York City for the next several weeks and open to the public.

== Post-war and the 1920s ==

&quot;Arizona&quot; sailed from New York for Hampton Roads on 22 January 1919; she continued south to Guantanamo Bay on 4 February and arrived on four days later. The time in Caribbean waters was mostly used in training for battles and fleet maneuvering, although it included a liberty visit to Port of Spain. In April, &quot;Arizona&quot;‚Ä≥s crew won the Battenberg Cup rowing competition for the second straight year before the ship was deployed to France once again to escort President Wilson back to the United States. While the ship was awaiting Wilson&#x27;s departure, she was redeployed to Smyrna (now ƒ∞zmir) in Turkey in response to tensions between Greece and Italy over the awarding of Smyrna to Greece in the Paris Peace Treaty. The Greek and Italian governments had each deployed a major warship to the area (&quot;Georgios Averof&quot; and &quot;Duilio&quot;, respectively) to enforce their interests. Shortly after &quot;Arizona&quot; arrived, Greek ground forces arrived in transports and were off-loaded in the port. The resultant chaos in the city caused many American citizens in the area to seek shelter on board &quot;Arizona&quot;.

When the crisis abated, &quot;Arizona&quot; was ordered to Constantinople (now Istanbul) before she sailed for home on 15 June. She put into the New York Navy Yard on 30 June for an overhaul, where six 5-inch guns were removed and the fire control system was modernized. Work was completed in January 1920 and the battleship sailed south to Guantanamo Bay for crew training. During this time, &quot;Arizona&quot; was fitted with a flying-off platform similar to the one given to &quot;Texas&quot; in March 1919. In April, &quot;Arizona&quot; lost the Battenberg Cup to &quot;Nevada&quot;, and in June she was present for the Naval Academy&#x27;s graduation ceremonies. In August she became the flagship of Battleship Division Seven, although it was only later in 1920 that the battleship was refitted to be an admiral&#x27;s flagship.
In company with six battleships and eighteen destroyers, &quot;Arizona&quot; was sent south again to transit the Panama Canal in January 1921. After meeting up with the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Arizona&quot; continued on to Peru for a week before the two fleets combined to practice battle maneuvers. After a short return to the Atlantic, which included an overhaul in New York, &quot;Arizona&quot;, under the command of Jehu V. Chase, returned to Peru in the summer before she began operating from her new home port of San Pedro, California, part of Los Angeles, where she was based until 1940.

For the rest of the 1920s, &quot;Arizona&quot;‚Ä≥s service consisted of routine training exercises. Naval historian Paul Stillwell remarked that &quot;the Pacific years included a great deal of sameness and repetition&quot;, and his chronology of the ship&#x27;s movements is filled with phrases like &quot;torpedo-defense practice&quot;, &quot;battle-practice rehearsal&quot;, &quot;gunnery practice&quot;, &quot;en route to‚Ä¶&quot;, and &quot;anchored at‚Ä¶&quot;. A recurring theme in these years were the annual Fleet Problems, which began in 1923 and simulated large fleet actions by having most of the active fleet face off against each other. The first two simulated an attack on the Panama Canal from the west, while in 1925 they attempted to defend the Hawaiian Islands. Other 1920s Fleet Problems included the Caribbean, near Central America, the West Indies, and Hawaii. On 27 July 1923 the ship, under command of John Y.R. Blakely, joined President Warren G. Harding&#x27;s naval review in Seattle. Harding died just one week later, and &quot;Arizona&quot; joined the Pacific Fleet to fire a salute in his honor on 3 August.

Sometime in early March 1924 a prostitute named Madeline Blair stowed away aboard &quot;Arizona,&quot; trading sex for a free voyage to San Pedro until she was discovered on 12 April while the ship was anchored in Balboa, Panama. She was sent back to New York City and Captain Percy Olmstead later convened courts-martial for 23 sailors once the ship began her refit in the Bremerton Navy Yard, which imposed sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment. Admiral Henry A. Wiley, commander of the Battle Fleet, issued a letter of reprimand to all officers of the ship, including future Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh Burke, then an ensign. Admiral William V. Pratt, then in command of the division to which &quot;Arizona&quot; was assigned, thought the penalties excessive, and he ordered the reprimands stricken from the officer&#x27;s records when he became Chief of Naval Operations in 1930.

== Modernization ==

Four months after Fleet Problem IX in January 1929, &quot;Arizona&quot; was modernized at the Norfolk Navy Yard. New tripod masts, surmounted by three-tiered fire-control directors for the main and secondary armament, replaced the old hyperboloid cage masts; the number of five-inch guns was reduced to 12 and the guns re-positioned one deck higher, and eight 25-caliber five-inch anti-aircraft guns replaced the three-inch guns with which she had been originally equipped. These changes increased her crew to 92 officers and 1,639 enlisted men. The ship&#x27;s main gun turrets were modified to increase the maximum elevation of their guns to 30¬∞. The compressed-air catapult on the quarterdeck was replaced by one that used black powder. Her deck armor was increased by the addition of a thickness of Special Treatment Steel, and the ship was bulged to protect her from torpedoes. An additional bulkhead was added to the sides of the boiler rooms for the same purpose. At the same stroke, her own outfit of two submerged torpedo tubes was removed during this refit in light of a new appreciation that anticipated battleship engagement ranges made their future use improbable. This alteration also permitted the large transverse flat in which the tubes had been situated to be subdivided to reduce risks of flooding in action. &quot;Arizona&quot;‚Ä≥s machinery was almost entirely replaced; her high-pressure turbines were replaced by more powerful geared turbines from the canceled battleship , and six new boilers replaced her originals. Their additional power offset the ship&#x27;s increased displacement as demonstrated during her sea trials; &quot;Arizona&quot; made with at a displacement of .

== 1930s ==
On 19 March 1931, even before &quot;Arizona&quot; was put through post-modernization sea trials, she hosted President Herbert Hoover for a brief vacation in the Caribbean. The President visited Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Returning on 29 March, &quot;Arizona&quot; conducted her sea trials at Rockland, Maine, and had another catapult fitted on the top of Turret III, before she was transferred to the West Coast in August with her sister &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. In February 1932, the ship participated in Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 in which carrier aircraft successfully attacked Pearl Harbor on Sunday morning, 7 February. After returning to the West Coast from Fleet Problem¬†XIV in 1933, the ship was anchored in San Pedro when an earthquake struck nearby Long Beach, California, on 10 March. Sailors from the ship joined the relief efforts, providing food, treating the injured, and providing security from looters.

In early 1934, the ship and her crew were filmed for the James Cagney/Warner Brothers film &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot;, which made extensive use of exterior footage as well as on-board location shots. In the early morning of 26 July, &quot;Arizona&quot; collided with a fishing trawler, &quot;Umatilla&quot;, that was under tow by another trawler off Cape Flattery. Two men aboard &quot;Umatilla&quot; were killed in the collision and the Navy convened a Court of Inquiry to investigate the incident. The court recommended that the ship&#x27;s captain, Captain MacGillivray Milne, be court-martialed. This took place at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, while the ship was participating in that year&#x27;s Fleet Problem off the East Coast. Milne was judged guilty and replaced several months later by Captain George Baum after the ship returned to the West Coast. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel W. Bryant assumed command of Battleship Division Two on 4 September, with &quot;Arizona&quot; as his flagship.

Rear Admiral George T. Pettengill relieved Bryant on 4 March 1935 and the ship participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later. &quot;Arizona&quot; made a port visit to Balboa in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain George A. Alexander relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret&#x27;s sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the released water leaked into the turret&#x27;s electrical switchboard and started a small fire that was easily put out. Due to the navy&#x27;s limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In Fiscal Year 1936‚Äì37, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship spent the rest of her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.

On 2 January 1937, Rear Admiral John Greenslade assumed command of Battleship Division Two from Bloch and transferred his flag to the battleship on 13 April. Rear Admiral Manley H. Simons, commander of Battleship Division One, transferred his flag to &quot;Arizona&quot; on 7 August. He was relieved by Rear Admiral Adolphus E. Watson on 8 November. Captain Alfred Winsor Brown relieved Baum on 11 December. The ship participated in Fleet Problem XIX off Hawaii in April‚ÄìMay 1938. Captain Brown died in his sleep on 7 September and Captain Isaac C. Kidd assumed command of the ship on 17 September 1938. That same day, Rear Admiral Chester Nimitz assumed command of Battleship Division One. Nimitz was relieved on 27 May 1939 by Rear Admiral Russell Willson. Captain Harold C. Train assumed command of the ship on 5 February 1940.

&quot;Arizona&quot;‚Ä≥s last fleet problem was off Hawaii in April‚ÄìMay 1940. At its conclusion, the United States Pacific Fleet was retained in Hawaiian waters, based at Pearl Harbor, to deter the Japanese. She was overhauled at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, from October 1940 to January 1941. During this refit, the foundation for a search radar was added atop her foremast, her anti-aircraft directors were upgraded and a platform for four water-cooled caliber M2 Browning machine guns was installed at the very top of the mainmast. Her last flag change-of-command occurred on 23 January 1941, when Willson was relieved by Isaac Kidd, by that time a rear admiral.

Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh relieved Train on 5 February 1941. On 22 October 1941, during an exercise taking place in heavy fog, the ship was hit in the bow by the . &quot;Arizona&quot; had been scheduled to depart for Bremerton Navy Yard in November to undergo an overhaul. The accident instead required her to be dry-docked at Pearl Harbor for repairs to the collision damage. As a result, she remained in Hawaii. The ship&#x27;s last sortie was a night-firing exercise on the night of 4 December as part of Battleship Division One, alongside &quot;Nevada&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. All three ships moored at quays along Ford Island on the following day. On 6 December, the repair ship came alongside to assist the ship&#x27;s crew with minor repairs.

== Attack on Pearl Harbor ==

Shortly before 08:00 local time on 7 December 1941, Japanese aircraft from six aircraft carriers struck the Pacific Fleet as it lay in port at Pearl Harbor, and wreaked devastation on the warships and installations defending Hawaii. On board &quot;Arizona&quot;, the ship&#x27;s air raid alarm went off at about 07:55, and the ship went to general quarters soon after. Shortly after 08:00, ten Nakajima B5N2 &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bombers, five each from the carriers and , attacked &quot;Arizona&quot;. All of the aircraft were carrying armor-piercing shells modified into bombs. Flying at an estimated altitude of , &quot;Kaga&quot;‚Ä≥s aircraft bombed &quot;Arizona&quot; from amidships to stern. Soon after, &quot;Hiry≈´&quot;‚Ä≥s bombers hit the bow area.

The aircraft scored four hits and three near-misses on and around &quot;Arizona&quot;. The near-miss off the port bow is thought to have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The stern-most bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain&#x27;s pantry, causing a small fire. The next forward-most hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating in the area of the anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.

=== Magazine explosion ===

The last bomb hit at 08:06 in the vicinity of Turret II, likely penetrating the armored deck near the magazines located in the forward section of the ship. While not enough of the ship is intact to judge the exact location, its effects are indisputable: about seven seconds after the hit, the forward magazines detonated in a cataclysmic explosion, mostly venting through the sides of the ship and destroying much of the interior structure of the forward part of the ship. This caused the forward turrets and conning tower to collapse downward some and the foremast and funnel to collapse forward, effectively tearing the ship in two. The explosion touched off fierce fires that burned for two days; debris showered down on Ford Island in the vicinity. The blast from this explosion also put out fires on the repair ship &quot;Vestal&quot;, which was moored alongside. The bombs and subsequent explosion killed 1,177 of the 1,512 crewmen on board at the time, approximately half of the lives lost during the attack.

Two competing hypotheses have arisen about the cause of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black-powder magazine used for the ship&#x27;s saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which were used for the ship&#x27;s main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine the cause of the magazine explosion.

=== Awards and recognition ===
After the attack, several sailors received medals for their conduct and actions under fire. Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua, the ship&#x27;s damage control officer, earned the Medal of Honor for his cool-headedness while quelling fires and getting survivors off the wrecked battleship. Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor also went to two high-ranking officers who were on board the battleship when it was destroyed: Rear Admiral Kidd, the first flag officer killed in the Pacific war, and Captain Van Valkenburgh, who reached the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the bomb that hit the onboard ammunition magazines destroyed it. &quot;Arizona&quot; was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.

== Salvage and memorial ==

&quot;Arizona&quot; was placed &quot;in ordinary&quot; (declared to be temporarily out of service) at Pearl Harbor on 29 December, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1942. She was so badly damaged by the magazine explosion that she was not thought fit for service even if she could be salvaged, unlike many of the other sunken ships nearby. Her surviving superstructure was scrapped in 1942, and her main armament was salvaged over the next year and a half. The aft main gun turrets were removed and reinstalled as United States Army Coast Artillery Corps Battery Arizona at Kahe Point on the west coast of Oahu and Battery Pennsylvania on the Mokapu Peninsula, covering Kaneohe Bay at what is now Marine Corps Base Hawaii. Battery Pennsylvania fired its guns for the first and last time on V-J Day in August 1945 while training, while the nearby Battery Arizona was never completed. Both forward turrets were left in place, although the guns from Turret II were salvaged and later installed on &quot;Nevada&quot; in the fall of 1944 after having been straightened and relined. &quot;Nevada&quot; later fired these same guns against the Japanese islands of Okinawa and Iwo Jima.

=== &quot;Arizona&quot; memorials ===
It is commonly‚Äîbut incorrectly‚Äîbelieved that &quot;Arizona&quot; remains perpetually in commission, like the . &quot;Arizona&quot; is under the control of the National Park Service, but the US¬†Navy still retains the title. &quot;Arizona&quot; retains the right, in perpetuity, to fly the United States flag as if she were an active, commissioned naval vessel.

The wreck of &quot;Arizona&quot; remains at Pearl Harbor to commemorate the men of her crew lost that December morning in 1941. On 7 March 1950, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet at that time, instituted the raising of colors over her remains. Legislation during the administrations of presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy resulted in the designation of the wreck as a national shrine in 1962. A memorial was built across the ship&#x27;s sunken remains, including a shrine room listing the names of the lost crew members on a marble wall. The national memorial was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 15 October 1966. The ship herself was designated a National Historic Landmark on 5 May 1989. Upon their death, survivors of the attack were able to have their ashes placed within the ship among their fallen comrades. Veterans who served aboard the ship at other times had the choice of scattering their ashes in the water above the ship. The last survivor of &quot;Arizona&quot;, Lou Conter, died in April 2024 at the age of 102.

While the superstructure and two of the four main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water. Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than escaping into the harbor per day. In 2004, the US Navy and the National Park Service oversaw a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being careful to honor its role as a war grave. The navy considered non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage of oil to avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor.

One of the original &quot;Arizona&quot; bells now hangs in the University of Arizona Student Union Memorial Center bell tower. The bell was rung after every home football victory over any team except other Arizona schools. , the bell is no longer rung due to the risk of damaging it. A gun, mast, and anchor from &quot;Arizona&quot; are in Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza just east of the Arizona State Capitol complex in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. The gun&#x27;s plaque states that it was not on the ship during the Pearl Harbor attack, but was being relined for mounting on the battleship &quot;Nevada&quot;. It is paired with a gun from the battleship to represent the start and end of the Pacific War for the United States. Other artifacts from the ship, such as items from the ship&#x27;s silver service, are on permanent exhibit in the Arizona State Capitol Museum.

Every two years the Navy awards &quot;The USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial Trophy&quot; to a ship that has achieved the highest combat readiness in Strike warfare, Surface Fire Support and Anti-Surface warfare, as determined by the Chief of Naval Operations. The bronze trophy on a black marble base was provided to the Navy by the citizens of the state of Arizona on 7 December 1987.

<text>Nikolaas &quot;Niko&quot; Tinbergen ( , ; 15 April 1907 ‚Äì 21 December 1988) was a Dutch biologist and ornithologist who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Karl von Frisch and Konrad Lorenz for their discoveries concerning the organization and elicitation of individual and social behavior patterns in animals. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern ethology, the study of animal behavior.

In 1951, he published &quot;The Study of Instinct&quot;, an influential book on animal behaviour.
In the 1960s, he collaborated with filmmaker Hugh Falkus on a series of wildlife films, including &quot;The Riddle of the Rook&quot; (1972) and &quot;Signals for Survival&quot; (1969), which won the Italia prize in that year and the American blue ribbon in 1971.

== Early life and education ==
Born in The Hague, Netherlands, he was one of five children of Dirk Cornelis Tinbergen and his wife Jeannette van Eek. His brother, Jan Tinbergen, won the first Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 1969. They are the only siblings to each win a Nobel Prize. Another brother, Luuk Tinbergen, was also a noted biologist.

Tinbergen&#x27;s interest in nature manifested itself when he was young. He studied biology at Leiden University and was a prisoner of war during World War II in Kamp Sint-Michielsgestel. Tinbergen&#x27;s experience as a prisoner of the Nazis led to some friction with longtime intellectual collaborator Konrad Lorenz, and it was several years before the two reconciled.

After the war, Tinbergen moved to England, where he taught at the University of Oxford and was a fellow first at Merton College, Oxford, and later at Wolfson College, Oxford. Several of his graduate students went on to become prominent biologists including Richard Dawkins, Marian Dawkins, Desmond Morris, Iain Douglas-Hamilton, and Tony Sinclair.

== &quot;The Study of Instinct&quot; ==
In 1951 Tinbergen&#x27;s The Study of Instinct was published. Behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists still recognise the contribution this book offered the field of behavioural science studies. The Study of Instinct summarises Tinbergen&#x27;s ideas on innate behavioural reactions in animals and the adaptiveness and evolutionary aspects of these behaviours. By behaviour, he means the total movements made by the intact animal; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process. The major question of the book is the role of internal and external stimuli in controlling the expression of behaviour.

In particular, he was interested in explaining &#x27;spontaneous&#x27; behaviours: those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning. He explains how behaviour can be considered a combination of these spontaneous behaviour patterns and as set series of reactions to particular stimuli. Behaviour is a reaction in that to a certain extent it is reliant on external stimuli, however it is also spontaneous since it is also dependent upon internal causal factors.

His model for how certain behavioural reactions are provoked was based on work by Konrad Lorenz. Lorenz postulated that for each instinctive act there is a specific energy which builds up in a reservoir in the brain. In this model, Lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a spring valve at its base that an appropriate stimulus could act on, much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy, an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour.

Tinbergen added complexity to this model, a model now known as Tinbergen&#x27;s hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an innate releasing mechanism that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block that needs to be removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen&#x27;s model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.

An example is in his experiments with foraging honey bees. He showed that honey bees show curiosity for yellow and blue paper models of flowers, and suggested that these were visual stimuli causing the buildup of energy in one specific centre. However, the bees rarely landed on the model flowers unless the proper odour was also applied. In this case, the chemical stimuli of the odour allowed the next link in the chain to be released, encouraging the bee to land. The final step was for the bee to insert its mouthparts into the flower and initiate suckling. Tinbergen envisioned this as concluding the reaction set for honey bee feeding behaviour.

== Nobel Prize ==
In 1973, Tinbergen, along with Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine &quot;for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns&quot;. The award recognised their studies on genetically programmed behaviour patterns, their origins, maturation and their elicitation by key stimuli. In his Nobel Lecture, Tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award the prize for Physiology or Medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as &quot;mere animal watchers&quot;. Tinbergen stated that their revival of the &quot;watching and wondering&quot; approach to studying behaviour could indeed contribute to the relief of human suffering.

The studies performed by the trio on fish, insects and birds laid the foundation for further studies on the importance of specific experiences during critical periods of normal development, as well as the effects of abnormal psychosocial situations in mammals. At the time, these discoveries were stated to have caused &quot;a breakthrough in the understanding of the mechanisms behind various symptoms of psychiatric disease, such as anguish, compulsive obsession, stereotypic behaviour and catatonic posture&quot;. Tinbergen&#x27;s contribution to these studies included the testing of the hypotheses of Lorenz/von Frisch by means of &quot;comprehensive, careful, and ingenious experiments&quot; as well as his work on supernormal stimuli. The work of Tinbergen during this time was also regarded as having possible implications for further research in child development and behaviour.

He also caused some intrigue by dedicating a large part of his acceptance speech to FM Alexander, originator of the Alexander technique, a method which investigates postural reflexes and responses in human beings.

== Other awards and honours ==
In 1950 Tinbergen became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1962. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1961, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1974, and the American Philosophical Society in 1975. He was also awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal in 1969 by the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union, and in 1973 received the Swammerdam Medal and Wilhelm B√∂lsche Medal (from the Genootschap ter bervordering van Natuur-, Genees- en Heelkunde of the University of Amsterdam and the Kosmos-Gesellschaft der Naturfreunde respectively).

== Approach to animal behaviour ==
Tinbergen described four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour, which were:

# Causation (mechanism): what are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent learning? How do behaviour and psyche &quot;function&quot; on the molecular, physiological, neuro-ethological, cognitive and social level, and what do the relations between the levels look like? (compare: Nicolai Hartmann: &quot;The laws about the levels of complexity&quot;)
# Development (ontogeny): how does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown? Which developmental steps (the ontogenesis follows an &quot;inner plan&quot;) &quot;and&quot; which environmental factors play when / which role? (compare: Recapitulation theory)
# Function (adaptation): how does the behaviour impact on the animal&#x27;s chances of survival and reproduction?
# Evolution (phylogeny): how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related species, and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny? Why did structural associations (behaviour can be seen as a &quot;time space structure&quot;) evolve in this manner and not otherwise?*

These have been long recognized in Philosophy of Biology to strongly correspond with the efficient, material, formal and final causes of Aristotelian causality, though Tinbergen does not reference Aristotle in his work. In ethology and sociobiology, causation and ontogeny are summarised as the &quot;proximate mechanisms&quot;, while adaptation and phylogeny are the &quot;ultimate mechanisms&quot;. They are still considered as the cornerstone of modern ethology, sociobiology and transdisciplinarity in Human Sciences.

== Supernormal stimulus ==
A major body of Tinbergen&#x27;s research focused on what he termed the supernormal stimulus. This was the concept that one could build an artificial object which was a stronger stimulus or releaser for an instinct than the object for which the instinct originally evolved. He constructed plaster eggs to see which a bird preferred to sit on, finding that they would select those that were larger, had more defined markings, or more saturated colour‚Äîand a dayglo-bright one with black polka dots would be selected over the bird&#x27;s own pale, dappled eggs.

Tinbergen found that territorial male three-spined stickleback (a small freshwater fish) would attack a wooden fish model more vigorously than a real male if its underside was redder. He constructed cardboard dummy butterflies with more defined markings that male butterflies would try to mate with in preference to real females. The superstimulus, by its exaggerations, clearly delineated what characteristics were eliciting the instinctual response.

Among the modern works calling attention to Tinbergen&#x27;s classic work is Deirdre Barrett&#x27;s 2010 book, &quot;Supernormal Stimuli&quot;.

== Autism ==
Tinbergen applied his observational methods to the problems of autistic children. He recommended a &quot;holding therapy&quot; in which parents hold their autistic children for long periods of time while attempting to establish eye contact, even when a child resists the embrace. However, his interpretations of autistic behaviour, and the holding therapy that he recommended, lacked scientific support and the therapy has been described as controversial and potentially abusive, particularly by individuals with autism themselves.

== Personal life ==
Tinbergen was a member of the advisory committee to the Anti-Concorde Project and was also an atheist.

Tinbergen married Elisabeth Rutten (1912‚Äì1990) and they had five children. Later in life he suffered depression and feared he might, like his brother Luuk, commit suicide. He was treated by his friend, whose ideas he had greatly influenced, John Bowlby. Tinbergen died on 21 December 1988, after suffering a stroke at his home in Oxford, England.

<text>Judith Martin (n√©e Perlman; born September 13, 1938), better known by the pen name Miss Manners, is an American columnist, author, and etiquette authority.

== Early life and career ==

Martin is the daughter of Helen and Jacob Perlman, both Jewish. Her father was born in 1898 in Bia≈Çystok, then part of the Russian Empire, now in Poland. He immigrated to the United States in 1912. In 1925, he received his doctorate from the University of Wisconsin, in economics. Jacob married Helen Aronson in 1935, and they moved to Washington, D.C., where Martin was born in 1938.

Martin spent a significant part of her childhood in Washington, where she still lives and works, graduating from Jackson-Reed High School Class of 1955. She lived in various foreign capitals as a child, as her father, a United Nations economist, was frequently transferred. Martin graduated from Wellesley College with a degree in English. Before she began the advice column, she was a journalist, covering social events at the White House and embassies; she then became a theater and film critic.

== &quot;Miss Manners&quot; ==
In 1978, Martin began writing an advice column, which was distributed three and later six times a week by Universal Uclick and carried in more than 200 newspapers worldwide. In the column, she answers etiquette questions contributed by her readers and writes short essays on problems of manners, or clarifies the essential qualities of politeness.

Martin writes about the ideas and intentions underpinning seemingly simple rules, providing a complex and advanced perspective, which she refers to as &quot;&quot;. Her columns have been collected in a number of books. In her writings, Martin refers to herself in the third person (e.g., &quot;Miss Manners hopes...&quot;).

In a 1995 interview by Virginia Shea, Martin said:

You can deny all you want that there is etiquette, and a lot of people do in everyday life. But if you behave in a way that offends the people you&#x27;re trying to deal with, they will stop dealing with you...There are plenty of people who say, &quot;We don&#x27;t care about etiquette, but we can&#x27;t stand the way so-and-so behaves, and we don&#x27;t want him around!&quot; Etiquette doesn&#x27;t have the great sanctions that the law has. But the main sanction we do have is in not dealing with these people and isolating them...

Martin identifies &quot;blatant greed&quot; as the most serious etiquette problem in the United States. The most frequently asked question she receives is how to politely demand cash from potential gift-givers (which she answers by stating that there is no polite way to do this), and the second most common question is how much potential guests must spend on a gift (determined by what the giver can afford, not by the event, relationship, related expenses or other factors).

On August 29, 2013, Martin&#x27;s children, Nicholas and Jacobina, began sharing credit for her columns.

== Other ==
Martin was the recipient of a 2005 National Humanities Medal from President George W. Bush. On March 23, 2006, she was a special guest correspondent on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, giving her analysis of the manners with which the White House Press Corps spoke to the President.

Some of Martin&#x27;s writings were collected and set to music by Dominick Argento in his song cycle &quot;Miss Manners on Music&quot;.

Judith Martin was a contributor for wowOwow, a Web site for women to talk culture, politics, and gossip.

Martin&#x27;s uncle was economist and labor historian Selig Perlman.

Martin was portrayed by Broadway theatre actress Jessie Mueller in &quot;The Post&quot;, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2017 movie about the Pentagon Papers.

<text>Jan Tinbergen ( , ; 12 April 1903 ‚Äì 9 June 1994) was a Dutch economist who was awarded the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969, which he shared with Ragnar Frisch for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes. He is widely considered to be one of the most influential economists of the 20th century and one of the founding fathers of econometrics.

His important contributions to econometrics include the development of the first macroeconometric models, the solution of the identification problem, and the understanding of dynamic models. Tinbergen was a founding trustee of Economists for Peace and Security. In 1945, he founded the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB) and was the agency&#x27;s first director.

==Biography==
Tinbergen was the eldest of five children of Dirk Cornelis Tinbergen and Jeannette van Eek. His brother Nikolaas &quot;Niko&quot; Tinbergen would also win a Nobel Prize (for physiology, during 1973) for his work in ethology, while his youngest brother Luuk would become a famous ornithologist. Jan and Nikolaas Tinbergen are the only siblings to have both won Nobel Prizes.

Between 1921 and 1925, Tinbergen studied mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden under Paul Ehrenfest. During those years at Leiden, he had numerous discussions with Ehrenfest, Kamerlingh Onnes, Hendrik Lorentz, Pieter Zeeman, and Albert Einstein.

After graduating, Tinbergen fulfilled his community service in the administration of a prison in Rotterdam and at the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in The Hague. He then returned to the University of Leiden and in 1929 defended his PhD thesis titled &quot;Minimumproblemen in de natuurkunde en de economie&quot; (Minimisation problems in Physics and Economics). This topic was suggested by Ehrenfest and allowed Tinbergen to combine his interests in mathematics, physics, economics and politics. At that time, CBS established a new department of business surveys and mathematical statistics, and Tinbergen became its first chairman, working at CBS until 1945. Access to the vast CBS data helped Tinbergen in testing his theoretical models. In parallel, starting from 1931, he was professor of statistics at the University of Amsterdam, and in 1933 he was appointed associate professor of mathematics and statistics at The Netherlands School of Economics, Rotterdam, where he stayed until 1973.

From 1929 to 1945 he worked for the Dutch statistical office and served as consultant at the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations (1936‚Äì1938). In 1945 he became the first director of the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis and left this position in 1955 to focus on education. He spent one year as a visiting professor at the Harvard University and then returned to the Dutch Economic Institute (the successor of the Netherlands School of Economics). In parallel, he provided consulting services to international organizations and governments of various developing countries, such as United Arab Republic, Turkey, Venezuela, Surinam, Indonesia and Pakistan.

Tinbergen became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946. He was also a member of the International Academy of Science, Munich. In 1956 he founded the Econometric Institute at the Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam together with Henri Theil, who also was his successor in Rotterdam. In 1960, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The Tinbergen Institute was named in his honour. The International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded its Honorary Fellowship to Jan Tinbergen in 1962. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1963. In 1968, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1974.

==Work==
For many, Jan Tinbergen became known for the so-called &#x27;Tinbergen Norm&#x27; often discussed long after his death. There is no written work of Tinbergen in which he himself states it formally. It is generally believed to be the principle that, if the ratio between the greatest and least income exceeds 5, it becomes disadvantageous for the societal unit involved. Tinbergen himself discussed some technicalities of a five-to-one income distribution ratio in an article published in 1981. Apart from specifics about a five-to-one ratio, it is true in general that Tinbergen&#x27;s grand theme was income distribution and the search for an optimal social order.

Tinbergen developed the first national comprehensive macroeconomic model, which he first developed in 1936 for the Netherlands, and later applied to the United States and the United Kingdom.

In his work on macroeconomic modelling and economic policy making, Tinbergen classified some economic quantities as &quot;targets&quot; and others as &quot;instruments&quot;. Targets are those macroeconomic variables the policy maker wishes to influence, whereas instruments are the variables that the policy maker can control directly. Tinbergen emphasized that achieving the desired values of a certain number of targets requires the policy maker to control an equal number of instruments. This is known as the Tinbergen Rule.

Tinbergen&#x27;s classification remains influential today, underlying the theory of monetary policy used by central banks. Many central banks today regard the inflation rate as their target; the policy instrument they use to control inflation is the short-term interest rate.

Tinbergen&#x27;s work on macroeconomic models was later continued by Lawrence Klein, contributing to another Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. For his cultural contributions, he was given the Gouden Ganzenveer in 1985.

Tinbergen&#x27;s econometric modelling lead to a lively debate with several known participants including J.M. Keynes, Ragnar Frisch and Milton Friedman. The debate is sometime referred to as the Tinbergen debate. (see Keynes‚ÄìTinbergen debate.)

<doc id="188103" wikidata="Q60060" url="?curid=188103" title="Karl von Frisch">
<text>Karl Ritter von Frisch, (20 November 1886 ‚Äì 12 June 1982) was a German-Austrian ethologist who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1973, along with Nikolaas Tinbergen and Konrad Lorenz.

His work centered on investigations of the sensory perceptions of the honey bee and he was one of the first to translate the meaning of the waggle dance. His theory, described in his 1927 book &quot;Aus dem Leben der Bienen&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Dancing Bees&quot;), was disputed by other scientists and greeted with skepticism at the time. Only much later was it shown to be an accurate theoretical analysis.

==Early life==

Karl Ritter von Frisch was the son of the surgeon and urologist Anton von Frisch (1849‚Äì1917), by his marriage to Marie Exner. Karl was the youngest of four sons, all of whom became university professors. Von Frisch was of partial Jewish heritage. His maternal grandmother was of Jewish origin.

Karl studied at the University of Vienna under Hans Leo Przibram and in Munich under Richard von Hertwig, initially in the field of medicine, but later turned to the natural sciences. He received his doctorate in 1910 and in the same year started work as an assistant in the zoology department of the University of Munich.

==Career==

In 1912, he became a lecturer in zoology and comparative anatomy there; and in 1919 was promoted to a professorship. His research on honeybees was continued by his student Ingeborg Beling. In 1921 he went to Rostock University as a professor of zoology and director of an institute. In 1923 he accepted the offer of a chair at Breslau University, returning in 1925 to Munich University, where he became the head of the institute of zoology.

Von Frisch attracted negative attention from the Nazi regime, among other things for employing Jewish assistants, including many women, and for practicing &quot;Jewish science&quot;. Eventually Frisch was forced into retirement, but the decision was reversed because of his research on nosema infections in bees.

The institute of zoology was destroyed in the Second World War, and in 1946, Frisch went to work at the University of Graz, remaining there until 1950, when he returned to the reopened Munich institute. He retired in 1958 but continued his research.

==Personal life==

Karl Ritter von Frisch married Margarete, n√©e Mohr, who died in 1964. Their son, Otto Ritter von Frisch, was director of the Brunswick natural history museum between 1977 and 1995.

==Research==

Frisch studied aspects of animal behaviour, including animal navigation, in the Carniolan honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera carnica&quot;), a subspecies of the European honey bee.

===Bee perception===

Frisch discovered that bees can distinguish various blossoming plants by their scent, and that each bee is &quot;flower constant&quot;. Surprisingly, their sensitivity to a &quot;sweet&quot; taste is only slightly stronger than in humans. He thought possible that a bee&#x27;s spatial sense of smell arose from the firm coupling of its olfactory sense with its tactile sense.

Frisch was the second to demonstrate that honey bees had color vision (first was Charles Henry Turner), which he accomplished by using classical conditioning. He trained bees to feed on a dish of sugar water set on a colored card. He then set the colored card in the middle of a set of gray-toned cards. If the bees see the colored card as a shade of gray, then they will confuse the blue card with at least one of the gray-toned cards; bees arriving to feed will visit more than one card in the array. On the other hand, if they have color vision, then the bees visit only the blue card, as it is visually distinct from the other cards. A bee&#x27;s color perception is comparable to that of humans, but with a shift away from the red toward the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. For that reason bees cannot distinguish red from black (colorless), but they can distinguish the colors white, yellow, blue and violet. Color pigments which reflect UV radiation expand the spectrum of colors which can be differentiated. For example, several blossoms which may appear to humans to be of the same yellow color will appear to bees as having different colors (multicolored patterns) because of their different proportions of ultraviolet.

Frisch&#x27;s experiments caused a reaction from established professor Carl von Hess, who had concluded in his 1912 book &quot;Vergleichende Physiologie des Gesichtssinnes&quot; (Comparative Physiology of Vision) that invertebrates and fish were colour-blind. He published an experimental paper in 1913 (before Frisch could publish) and disputed Frisch&#x27;s knowledge, professionalism and conclusions, and those of John Lubbock before him. Frisch highlighted the errors in Hess&#x27;s experimental method and asked him to desist.

Frisch&#x27;s investigation of a bee&#x27;s powers of orientation were significant. He discovered that bees can recognize the desired compass direction in three different ways: by the Sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, whereby the Sun is used as the main compass, with the alternatives reserved for the conditions arising under cloudy skies or within a dark beehive.

Light scattered in a blue sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which is dependent on the position of the Sun and invisible to human eyes. With a UV receptor in each of the lens units of a compound eye, and a UV filter oriented differently in each of these units, a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern. A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring over the course of a day. This provides not only directional but also temporal information.

Frisch proved that variations in the position of the Sun over the course of a day provided bees with an orientation tool. They use this capability to obtain information about the progression of the day deep inside a dark beehive comparable to what is known from the position of the Sun. This makes it possible for the bees to convey always up-to-date directional information during their waggle dance, without having to make a comparison with the Sun during long dance phases. This provides them not only with alternative directional information, but also with additional temporal information.

Bees have an internal clock with three different synchronization or timekeeping mechanisms. If a bee knows the direction to a feeding place found during a morning excursion, it can also find the same location, as well as the precise time at which this source provides food, in the afternoon, based on the position of the sun.

Based on the magnetic field, the alignment of the plane of a honeycomb under construction (e.g., the new honeycomb of a swarm) will be the same as that of the home hive of the swarm, according to Frisch. By experiment, even deformed combs bent into a circle can be produced.

The vertical alignment of the honeycomb is attributed by Frisch to the ability of bees to identify what is vertical with the help of their head used as a pendulum together with a ring of sensory cells in the neck.

===Dances as language===

Knowledge about feeding places can be relayed from bee to bee. The means of communication is a special dance of which there are two forms:

====Round dance====

The &quot;round dance&quot; provides the information that there is a feeding place in the vicinity of the beehive at a distance between 50 and 100 meters, without the particular direction being given. By means of close contact among the bees it also supplies information about the type of food (blossom scent).

The foraging bee ... begins to perform a kind of &quot;round dance&quot;. On the part of the comb where she is sitting she starts whirling around in a narrow circle, constantly changing her direction, turning now right, now left, dancing clockwise and anti-clockwise, in quick succession, describing between one and two circles in each direction. This dance is performed among the thickest bustle of the hive. What makes it so particularly striking and attractive is the way it infects the surrounding bees; those sitting next to the dancer start tripping after her, always trying to keep their outstretched feelers on close contact with the tip of her abdomen. ... They take part in each of her manoeuvrings so that the dancer herself, in her mad wheeling movements, appears to carry behind her a perpetual comet&#x27;s tail of bees.

====Waggle dance====

The &quot;waggle dance&quot; is used to relay information about more distant food sources. In order to do this, the dancing bee moves forward a certain distance on the vertically hanging honeycomb in the hive, then traces a half circle to return to her starting point, whereupon the dance begins again. On the straight stretch, the bee &quot;waggles&quot; with her posterior. The direction of the straight stretch contains the information about the direction of the food source, the angle between the straight stretch and the vertical being precisely the angle which the direction of flight has to the position of the sun. The distance to the food source is relayed by the time taken to traverse the straight stretch, one second indicating a distance of approximately one kilometer (so the speed of the dance is inversely related to the actual distance). The other bees take in the information by keeping in close contact with the dancing bee and reconstructing its movements. They also receive information via their sense of smell about what is to be found at the food source (type of food, pollen, propolis, water) as well as its specific characteristics. The orientation functions so well that the bees can find a food source with the help of the waggle dance even if there are hindrances they must detour around like an intervening mountain.

As to a sense of hearing, Frisch could not identify this perceptive faculty, but it was assumed that vibrations could be sensed and used for communication during the waggle dance. Confirmation was later provided by Dr. J√ºrgen Tautz, a bee researcher at W√ºrzburg University&#x27;s Biocenter.

====&quot;Dialects&quot;====

The linguistic findings described above were based on Frisch&#x27;s work primarily with the Carnica variety of bees. Investigations with other varieties led to the discovery that language elements were variety-specific, so that how distance and direction information is relayed varies greatly.

===Other work===

Frisch&#x27;s honey bee work included the study of the pheromones that are emitted by the queen bee and her daughters, which maintain the hive&#x27;s very complex social order. Outside the hive, the pheromones cause the male bees, or drones, to become attracted to a queen and mate with her. Inside the hive, the drones are not affected by the odor.

<text>USS &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; was a of the United States Navy during the Korean War. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33¬†planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

She was named after the Badung Strait, located between the Indonesian islands of Bali and Nusa Besar, which was the site of a World War II battle in February 1942, between American‚ÄìNetherlands and Japanese naval forces.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
===Construction and early career===
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship, originally to have been named &quot;San Alberto Bay&quot;, was laid down on 18 August 1944, at the Todd-Pacific Shipyard in Tacoma, Washington. She was renamed &quot;Baedoeng Strait&quot; and was launched on 15 February 1945, after which she was moved to the Commercial Iron Works for fitting-out work. She was commissioned into active service on 14 November 1945, by which time World War II had ended. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; then underwent additional work to modify her to serve as a flagship, after which she sailed for San Diego, California, for her shakedown cruise and initial training. There, she carried out air qualification training with her new aircrew. She got underway again in late March 1946, bound for Pearl Harbor, which she reached on 2 April. She then returned to California on 20 April, where she was temporarily placed in reserve at San Diego.

On 6 January 1947, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; was recommissioned, and she went to sea on 14 January to begin training exercises, including flight operations with her new aircraft. She made another visit to Pearl Harbor from 11 to 26 February, before resuming training exercises off California that lasted through June. During this period, she alternated between Carrier Divisions 15 and 17, serving as the flagship of the divisions. On 5 July, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; went to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for an overhaul that lasted until 11 November. She then embarked on a shakedown cruise before resuming training operations through December. The ship began a cruise to the western Pacific on 5 January 1948 to ferry aircraft to the American base at Apra Harbor, Guam. There, she picked up passengers for the voyage back to California, arriving back in San Diego on 10 February. She next ferried aircraft to Pearl Harbor in April, followed by another overhaul at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard that began on 24 May and lasted for three months. She departed for San Diego on 16 June and spent the following four months carrying out anti-submarine warfare training. The rest of the year saw the ship confined to port.

In early January 1949, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; took aboard Composite Squadron VC-21, which was equipped with TBM-3 Avenger bombers for anti-submarine exercises, which continued until 25 February. She moved north to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for another overhaul on 30 March that lasted into early July, when she returned to San Diego. She returned to anti-submarine training with VC-21 and VC-11 from July through September. In October, she went to Hawaii for a two-week training period, before returning to San Diego on 14 November. The ship remained in port for the net two months, before resuming training operations in the middle of January 1950. She operated out of San Diego for the next six months before moving to Naval Air Station Alameda on 16 June, where she took on a contingent of 223 Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps cadets for a training cruise.

===Korean War===
The Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950, when North Korea invaded the South, and the United Nations intervened two days later. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; was ordered to join the forces assembling to defeat the North Korean invasion. The ship stopped in Pearl Harbor to disembark the NROTC cadets still aboard and then returned to San Diego to take on supplies and ammunition for wartime operations. On 14 July, she departed with the Marine Corps squadrons MAG-33 and VMF-323 aboard, bound for Kobe, Japan. While cruising near the Marianas Islands on 27 July, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; came alongside the dock landing ship to refuel that vessel. The two ships collided during refueling, but neither was damaged seriously. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; arrived in Kobe on 31 July and unloaded equipment before sortieing on 4 August to begin combat operations in the Tsushima Strait. The following day, one of VMF-323&#x27;s Vought F4U Corsair fighters crashed on landing, injuring the pilot and destroying the aircraft.

Beginning on 6 August, the ship&#x27;s aircraft began attacking North Korean forces and infrastructure in south-western Korea as they advanced on South Korean and American forces in the Battle of the Pusan Perimeter. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot;‚Ä≥s pilots carried out nearly 240 raids for the next week, and during this period, they supported an attack by the 1st Marine Brigade toward Jinju. The ship lost five aircraft during these operations, though four of the pilots survived. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; then briefly left to refuel and rearm at Sasebo, Japan, before resuming operations on 15 August. She and her sister ship provided further support to the 1st Marine Brigade until 23 August. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; was then detached to cover the withdrawal of the British destroyer , which had been damaged by North Korean aircraft. The carrier&#x27;s fighters provided combat air patrol over the damaged destroyer for two days as it passed through the Yellow Sea, and on 26 August, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; returned to the Tsushima Strait for further attacks on North Korean forces.

The ship returned to Sasebo on 29 August for another round of replenishment, departing again on 5 September. Her aircraft resumed attacks on North Korean positions the next day as Allied forces began preparations for the imminent landing at Incheon. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; returned to Sasebo on 11 September, then returned to operations off Korea two days later. Her aircraft supported Allied forces as they fought their way inland from Incheon from 14 to 22 September, before stopping in Incheon to replenish fuel and ammunition. After four days, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; got underway again to take part in the operation into the Seoul area, which culminated in the liberation of the South Korean capital on 28 September. The ship then moved north to interdict North Korean supply lines for the next several days. On 2 October, the ship left the combat area to replenish at Sasebo, arriving two days thereafter. She remained there for two weeks to give her crew a rest from the near constant combat operations over the last two months.

&quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; next went to sea on 16 October, rendezvousing with &quot;Sicily&quot; in the Sea of Japan later that day. By that time, the UN offensive into North Korea was well underway, and the ships covered operations around Wonsan for the following eleven days. She assisted a marine unit south of Wonsan that came under attack on 28 October from a North Korean division that had been bypassed by the main UN offensive. The ship next provided aerial support to the US 7th Infantry Division as it advanced toward Kapsan and Pungsan near the Chinese border. The weather worsened into November, frequently preventing air operations, and on 14 November, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; departed for Sasebo, arriving two days later. The ship returned to the coast of Korea on 23 November, and on 25 November, her aircraft began heavy operations against Chinese troops that had intervened in the war. Her planes provided aerial support to the marines fighting at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in late November and into December.

The ship withdrew to the Sea of Japan on 10 December to replenish fuel, ammunition, and stores while underway. Three days later, she had returned to Wonsan to cover the Hungnam evacuation over the course of 15‚Äì24 December. The following day, she refueled at sea and then moved into the Yellow Sea by 27 December, where her aircraft operated over Seoul, which was also being evacuated by Allied forces in the face of Chinese advances. The ship operated in the area through 6 January 1951, when bad weather and the need to refuel and rearm led the ship to withdraw once again to Sasebo, arriving there on 9 January. She remained there until 29 January, when she departed to return to San Diego. After arriving there on 7 February, she moved north for an overhaul at Puget Sound that lasted until mid-July. The ship sailed back to San Diego on 20 July, where she carried out a month of flight training in preparation for another deployment to Korea.

&quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; got underway on 15 September, bound for Korean waters. She stopped briefly in Pearl Harbor on 21 September and then continued on to Yokosuka, arriving there on 2 October. There, she joined Carrier Division 17 and became its flagship. She spent the next two months participating in anti-submarine training exercises held off Okinawa with other elements of the 7th Fleet. In December, she returned to Korea to join a blockade of North Korean ports. Over the following days, her aircraft took part in a number of operations in western North Korea. She returned to Yokosuka on 28 December for replenishment and then carried out patrols in the Yellow Sea between 7 January 1952 and 6 February. The Australian carrier replaced her that month, allowing &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; to return to San Diego. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way to drop off spare aircraft and other equipment, before proceeding on to San Diego, arriving there on 1 March.

The ship underwent periodic maintenance and then began a period of pilot training for Navy squadrons VS-23 and VS-871, followed by a Marine Corps helicopter unit in early June. She returned to San Diego on 11 June and thereafter made preparations for a third deployment to Korea. The ship got underway for East Asia on 19 July. She reached Japan by August, and while in Kobe on the 10th, she embarked planes from VS-931. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; then went to sea for anti-submarine training off Okinawa, and after a week there, joined the rest of 7th Fleet for operations off Japan that lasted through September. The ship finally sortied from Sasebo for combat operations on 5 October, though this time, her activities were limited to providing anti-submarine patrols for various naval units in the area off Wonsan. She returned to Sasebo on 17 October for maintenance that lasted until 28 October. The ship spent the next three months patrolling off the coast of Korea as part of the blockade force; she contributed her fighters for combat air patrols, to sweep for enemy forces, and to support Allied forces fighting ashore. During this period, she also took part in an officer exchange program with the British carrier . She arrived at Sasebo on 5 February 1953, unloaded equipment, and then proceeded to Yokosuka on 7 February, arriving two days later. On 11 February, she left for California, ending her operations in the Korean War. She earned six battle stars for her service during the conflict.

===Later career===
&quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; reached San Diego on 27 February; the following month, she moved to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul and modernization that lasted for six months. She then returned to San Diego to be placed in limited commissioned, allocated to the reserve fleet there. She was placed in full commission again in February 1954. For the next year, she carried out anti-submarine training, including tests of the new Grumman S-2 Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and of helicopters in the anti-submarine role. The ship made another cruise to East Asia beginning in April 1955. She had aboard VS-38 and a helicopter detachment from HS-2. During the cruise, she visited Japan, patrolled off the coast of China, and took part in anti-submarine exercises with elements of 7th Fleet. She visited Taiwan and Okinawa in September before steaming back across the Pacific, arriving in San Diego on 1 October. From there, she moved back to San Francisco for another three months of mainentance.

The ship returned to San Diego in February 1956, and thereafter departed to join several ships in the Marshall Islands to participate in Operation Redwing, a series of nuclear weapons tests that involved seventeen separate detonations. These were carried out at Eniwetok and the Bikini Atoll. &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; provided air transport from the fleet to Bikini, supported the Marine helicopter unit HMH-363, and served as a radiation safety checkpoint. Her crew also assisted with construction projects ashore. ON 31 July, she got underway for San Diego, arriving on 8 August. Late the following month, she took part in extensive amphibious assault training, which lasted for fifteen weeks and included joint operations with Marine helicopters. The exercises also tested helicopter assaults and helped to develop air assault doctrine.

By the late 1950s, &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; was worn out, and was too small to accommodate new jet aircraft and assault helicopters entering service. Because the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships were not large enough to operate these new aircraft, the Navy had begun to replace them with the much larger s by the mid-1950s. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. On 14 January 1957, she left San Diego for Bremerton, Washington, where she was prepared for long-term storage in the reserve. She was decommissioned on 17 May and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet based in Bremerton. On 7 April 1959, she was reclassified as an aircraft ferry with the hull number AKV-17, but she saw no further active use. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 December 1970, and on 8 May 1972, was sold to the ship breaking firm American Ship Dismantlers, based in Portland, Oregon. She was thereafter broken up for scrap.

<text>&quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; (Hungarian: &quot;Szomor√∫ Vas√°rnap&quot;), also known as the &quot;Hungarian Suicide Song&quot;, is a popular song composed by Hungarian pianist and composer Rezs≈ë Seress and published in 1933.

The original lyrics were titled &quot;V√©ge a vil√°gnak&quot; (&quot;The world is ending&quot;) and were about despair caused by war, ending in a quiet prayer about people&#x27;s sins. Poet L√°szl√≥ J√°vor wrote his own lyrics to the song, titled &quot;Szomor√∫ vas√°rnap&quot; (&quot;Sad Sunday&quot;), in which the protagonist wants to commit suicide following his lover&#x27;s death. The latter lyrics ended up becoming more popular while the former were essentially forgotten. The song was first recorded in Hungarian by pop singer P√°l Kalm√°r in 1935.

&quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; was first recorded in English by Hal Kemp in 1936, with lyrics by Sam M. Lewis, and was recorded the same year by Paul Robeson, with lyrics by Desmond Carter. It became well known throughout much of the English-speaking world after the release of a version by jazz and swing music singer Billie Holiday in 1941. Lewis&#x27;s lyrics refer to suicide, and the record label described it as the &quot;Hungarian Suicide Song&quot;. There is a recurring urban legend which claims that many people have taken their own lives while listening to this song, particularly Hungarians.

== Writing and background ==

The song was composed by Rezs≈ë Seress while living in Paris, in an attempt to become established as a songwriter in late 1932. The original musical composition was a piano melody in C minor, with the lyrics being sung over it. Seress wrote the song at the time of the Great Depression and increasing fascist influence in his native Hungary, although sources differ as to the degree to which his song was motivated by personal melancholy rather than concerns about the future of the world. The basis of Seress&#x27;s lyrics is a reproach to the injustices of man, with a prayer to God to have mercy on the modern world and the people who perpetrate evil. There are some suggestions that the words of &quot;V√©ge a vil√°gnak&quot; were in fact not written until World War II itself and not copyrighted until 1946.

Seress initially had difficulty finding a publisher, mainly due to the unusually melancholy nature of the song. One potential publisher stated, &quot;It is not that the song is sad, there is a sort of terrible compelling despair about it. I don&#x27;t think it would do anyone any good to hear a song like that.&quot;

The song was published as sheet music in late 1933, with lyrics by poet L√°szl√≥ J√°vor, who was inspired by a recent break-up with his fianc√©e. According to most sources, J√°vor rewrote the lyrics after the song&#x27;s first publication, although he is sometimes described as the original writer of its words. His lyrics contained no political sentiments, but rather were a lament for the death of a beloved and a pledge to meet with the lover again in the afterlife. This version of the song became the best known, and most later rewritings are based around the idea of lost love.

== Urban legends ==
There have been several urban legends regarding the song over the years, mostly involving it being allegedly connected with various numbers of suicides, and radio networks reacting by purportedly banning the song. However, most of these claims are unsubstantiated.

Press reports in the 1930s associated at least 100 suicides, both in Hungary and the United States, with &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot;, but most of the deaths supposedly linked to it are difficult to verify. The urban legend appears to be, for the most part, simply an embellishment of the high number of Hungarian suicides that occurred in the decade when the song was composed due to other factors such as famine and poverty. No studies have drawn a clear link between the song and suicide.

On 11 January 1968, about 35 years after writing the song, its composer killed himself.

The BBC banned Billie Holiday&#x27;s version of the song from being broadcast, as being detrimental to wartime morale, but allowed performances of instrumental versions. However, there is little evidence of any other radio bans; the BBC&#x27;s ban was lifted by 2002.

A cover of the song appeared on the Associates&#x27; second studio album &quot;Sulk&quot;, released on 14 May 1982, and named &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; at the end of 1982. Lead vocalist Billy Mackenzie killed himself on 22 January 1997.

The song&#x27;s lyrics are featured in the bridge of the Dead Milkmen song &quot;(Theme from) Blood Orgy of the Atomic Fern&quot;, on the band&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Bucky Fellini&quot;.

A highly fictional version of the song&#x27;s origin is at the heart of the 1999 German/Hungarian film &quot;Ein Lied von Liebe und Tod&quot; (&quot;Gloomy Sunday ‚Äì A Song of Love and Death&quot;).

A cover of &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; is featured on track three of Venetian Snares&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Rossz Csillag Alatt Sz√ºletett&quot;. It also samples Billie Holiday&#x27;s vocals.

The song inspired the 2006 movie &quot;The Kovak Box&quot;, in which a writer is trapped on the island of Mallorca with people who are injected with a microchip that causes them to take their own lives when they hear &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot;. The song plays during the movie, sung by the actress Luc√≠a Jim√©nez. A music video from the cover was released as part of the movie promotion. The song also features on the soundtrack of &quot;&quot; (2006), performed by Artie Shaw.

In 2008, Belgian artist Marieke Van Wuytswinkel used a sample of &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; in her work &quot;A Natural Morning&quot;.

<text>The Qara Khitai, or Kara Khitai ( or ), also known as the Western Liao (), officially the Great Liao (), was a dynastic regime based in Central Asia ruled by the Yel√º clan of the Khitan people. Being a rump state of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty, Western Liao was culturally Sinicized to a large extent, especially among the elites consisting of Liao refugees.

The dynasty was founded by Yel√º Dashi (Emperor Dezong), who led the remnants of the Liao dynasty from Manchuria to Central Asia after fleeing from the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty conquest of northern China. The empire was usurped by the Naimans under Kuchlug in 1211; traditional Chinese, Persian, and Arab sources consider the usurpation to be the end of the dynasty, even though the empire would not fall until the Mongol conquest in 1218. Some remnants of the Qara Khitai would form the Qutlugh-Khanid dynasty in southern Iran.

The territories of the Qara Khitai corresponded to parts of modern-day China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The Anushtegin dynasty, the Karluks, Qocho kingdom, the Kankalis, and the Kara-Khanid Khanate were vassal states of the Qara Khitai at some point in history. Chinese and Muslim historiographical sources, such as the &quot;History of Liao&quot;, considered the Qara Khitai to be a legitimate Chinese dynasty.

== Names ==
The Qara Khitai took on trappings of a Chinese state and inherited the dynastic name &quot;Great Liao&quot;. Hence, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese historians generally refer to the empire as the &quot;Western Liao&quot;, emphasizing its continuation from the Liao dynasty.

The name &quot;Qara Khitai&quot;, commonly used by Central Asian tribes to refer to the dynasty, is also commonly used in Western scholarly works. The term is often translated as the &quot;Black Khitans&quot; in Mongolian, but its original meaning is unclear today. In Modern Mongolian, &quot;Kara-Khitan&quot; is rendered &quot;–•–∞—Ä –•—è—Ç–∞–Ω&quot; (Khar Khyatan). Since no direct records from the empire survive today, the only surviving historical records about the empire come from foreign sources.

&quot;Black Khitans&quot; (ÈªëÂ•ë‰∏π) has also been seen used in Chinese. &quot;Qara,&quot; which literally means &quot;black,&quot; corresponds with the Liao&#x27;s dynastic color black and its dynastic element water, according to the theory of five elements (wuxing). The Jurchens referred to the empire as &quot;Dashi&quot; or &quot;Dashi Linya&quot; (after its founder), to reduce any claims the empire may have had to the old territories of the Liao dynasty. Muslim historians initially referred to the state simply as &quot;Khitay&quot; or &quot;Khitai;&quot; they may have adopted this form of &quot;Khitan&quot; via the Uyghurs of Kocho in whose language the final -n or -≈Ñ became -y. Only after the Mongol conquest did the state begin to be referred to in the Muslim world as the &quot;Kara-Khitai&quot; or &quot;Qara-Khitai.&quot; Khitan is the origin of &quot;Cathay&quot;, a European name for China.

== History ==
===Origin===
The Qara Khitai empire, also known as the Western Liao dynasty, was the remnant offshoot of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty. From 1114 to 1125, the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty conquered the Liao. In 1122, two groups of Khitans fled westward to escape the Jin invasion. One of these groups was led by Yel√º Dashi, who joined the Liao emperor, Tianzuo, at the border of the Western Xia kingdom. Dashi was captured by the Jin in 1123 and forced to lead them to Tianzuo&#x27;s camp, resulting in the capture of the entire Liao imperial family except for Tianzuo and one of his sons. Dashi later rejoined Tianzuo but the emperor was captured in early 1125 and died at the Jin court in 1128.

=== Founding of the Qara Khitai ===
In 1124, Yel√º Dashi fled northwest and established his headquarter at the military garrison of Kedun (Zhenzhou) on the Orkhon River. Dashi secured the allegiance of the garrison forces numbering 20,000 and set himself up as &quot;gurkhan&quot; (universal khan). He conquered two Jin tribes in 1129. In 1130, Dashi led his host further west in search of new territory. Within a year, he had established himself as suzerain of Qocho and gained a foothold in Transoxiana. In 1131, he attacked the Karakhanids at Kashgar but was repelled. He later returned in 1134 and conquered the Karakhanid city of Balasaghun (in modern Kyrgyzstan), resulting in the vassalization of the nearby Kankalis, Karluks, Kyrgyz, and the Kingdom of Qocho. Kashgar, Khotan, and Beshbalik.In 1137, he defeated the Western Karakhanids near Khujand and annexed Fergana and Tashkent. Yel√º Dashi&#x27;s host was further bolstered by 10,000 Khitans who had previously been subjects of the Karakhanids. They went on to conquer Kashgar, Khotan, and Beshbalik. 

===Battle of Qatwan===
The Western Karakhanids were vassals of the Seljuk Empire and the Karakhanid ruler Mahmud II appealed to his Seljuk overlord Ahmad Sanjar for protection. In 1141, Sanjar with his army arrived in Samarkand. The Khitans were invited by the Khwarazmians (also a vassal of the Seljuks) to conquer the lands of the Seljuks and responded to an appeal to intervene by the Karluks who were involved in a conflict with the Karakhanids and Seljuks.

Khitan forces ranging from 20,000 to 700,000 depending on the source met in battle with Seljuk forces numbering 100,000. While many Muslim sources suggested that the Khitan forces greatly outnumbered the Seljuks, some contemporary Muslim authors also reported that the battle was fought between forces of equal size. The Khitans were also said to have been given a reinforcement of 30,000‚Äì50,000 Karluk horsemen.

The Battle of Qatwan took place on the Qatwan steppe, north of Samarkand, on 9 September 1141. The Khitans attacked the Seljuk forces simultaneously, encircled them, and forced the Seljuq center into a wadi called Dargham, about 12¬†km from Samarkand. Encircled from all directions, the Seljuq army was destroyed and Sanjar barely escaped. Figures of the dead ranged from 11,000 to 100,000. Among those captured at the battle were Seljuq military commanders and Sanjar&#x27;s wife. The Seljuk defeat resulted in the loss of all of Transoxiana to the Khitans.

After his victory, Yel√º Dashi spent 90 days in Samarkand, accepting the loyalty of Muslim nobles and appointing Mahmud&#x27;s brother Ibrahim as the new ruler of Samarkand. Dashi allowed the Muslim Burhan family to continue to rule Bukhara. After this battle, Khwarazm became a vassal state of the Khitans. In 1142, Dashi sent Erbuz to Khwarazm to pillage the province, which forced Atsiz to agree to pay 30,000 dinars annual tribute.

===Territorial extent===
The Qara Khitai in 1143 constituted a realm encompassing a territory roughly equivalent to modern Xinjiang, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and south Kazakhstan. Under the empire&#x27;s direct rule was the region around their capital, Balasagun. Around it were the subject kingdoms of Qocho, the eastern and western Karakhanids, Khwarazm, and the Karluk tribes. Its western border was defined by the Amu Darya, but the Khitans were active in Khorasan until the 1180s while Balkh remained under their rule until 1198. In the north they bordered the Yenisei Kyrgyz north of Lake Balkhash until 1175 when they retreated further south. The southern boundary stretched from Balkh to Khotan to Hami. The boundary of the empire in the east is hard to define but the Khitans exercised some sovereignty over the Naimans east of the Altai Mountains until 1175.

===Conflict with Jin===
Simultaneously during the invasion of Central Asia, Dashi also sent invasion forces to attack the Jin and retake Liao territory, however these efforts proved fruitless and ended in defeat. Yel√º Dashi had originally hoped to recapture northern China from the Jin dynasty and restore the territories once held by the Liao dynasty. However, he soon discovered the relative weakness of his empire vis-a-vis the Jin dynasty and gave up the idea after a disastrous attack on the Jin dynasty in 1134. The Western Liao continued to defy Jin supremacy in 1146, and continued sending scouts and small military units against the Jin in 1156, 1177, 1185, 1188. This indicates that for the first 2 generations there remained considerable interest in reconquest.

=== Xiao Tabuyan (r. 1143-1150) ===

When Yel√º Dashi died, his wife and paternal cousin, Xiao Tabuyan (1143-1150), became regent for their son. Tabuyan used the honorific titles of empress Gantian, Gurkhan, and Dashi. Her successors retained the titles of Gurkhan and Dashi. While the &quot;History of Liao&quot; states that Tabuyan was merely a regent, Muslim sources state that she held unlimited power over the realm as is implied by her titles.

Taking advantage of Dashi&#x27;s death, the Oghuz invaded Bukhara but were likely driven off sometime before 1152, when they were located in Khuttal and Balkh. In 1143, the Seljuk sultan Ahmad Sanjar attacked Khwarazm and occupied Khorasan. Although Atsiz once again became a Seljuk subject, in practice he continued to pay tribute to the Qara Khitai. According to Ibn al-Athir, Atsiz was only spared due to Sanjar&#x27;s fear of the Khitans. Sanjar may have also wielded power in Transoxiana until his death, as implied by an 1148 coin minted in Bukhara. In 1144, Qocho offered tribute to the Jin. The Jin sent a messenger named Niange Hannu to the Qara Khitai. When he met Tabuyan in 1146, he refused to dismount in her presence and proclaimed that he had come from a superior court as an emissary of the Son of Heaven and demanded her to show obeisance to the Jin court. When he threatened that the Jin were ready to send an army to invade their lands, the empress executed him. His fate only became known to the Jin in 1175 as a result of deserters from the Qara Khitai.

===Yel√º Yilie (r. 1150-1163)===

The son, Yel√º Yilie, ruled from 1150 to 1163. The only known act he was involved in according to the &quot;History of Liao&quot; during his 13 year reign was taking a census of people over 18 years old. The result was 84,500 households in total. The small number, less than Samarkand&#x27;s 100,000 households in the pre-Mongol era, was likely due to being geographically limited to only Balasagun and the surrounding area that the Khitans directly ruled. It is unknown if even the sedentary population was counted in the census.

During Yilie&#x27;s reign, the Oghuz rebelled against Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan. The Khitans were at least partly responsible for this due to displacing the Oghuz in Transoxiana and pushing them into Balkh, where they were heavily taxed by Sanjar due to his losses at Qatwan. The Oghuz rebellion was caused by the governor of Balkh, Amir Qumach, who had enlisted Oghuz support against the Ghurids in 1152. However the Oghuz defected to the Ghurids, allowing them to temporarily occupy Balkh. After retaking the city, Qumach increased the tax burdens on the Oghuz. In 1153, the Oghuz killed a Seljuk tax collector and Qumach retaliated by attacking them. In the conflict that followed, Qumach and his sons were killed, and Sanjar was defeated and captured. The Oghuz plundered Khorasan whil Sanjar escaped captivity in 1156 but failed to restore his former authority. He died the following year.

There is no evidence that the Khitans were directly involved in the conflict of Khorasan, however the Turkic leaders all paid tribute to them to gain their favor during this time. The lack of Khitan involvement may be due to conflict with the Jin to the east. In 1156, a Jin army led by Po Longdun met with a Qara Khitan raiding group several hundred strong at Kedun. The Khitan force withdrew after negotiations. Khitans under Jin rule rebelled in 1161. One of the rebel leaders, Saba, planned to defect to the Qara Khitai, but was killed by another Khitan leader, Yel√º Wowo, who proclaimed himself the new Khitan emperor. Wowo was killed by the Jurchens in 1163.

The Qara Khitai played a key role in the conflict between their vassals: the Karluks, Karakhanids, and Khwarazm. In early 1156, the Karluks killed Ibrahim Tabghach Khan, the Western Karakhanid ruler of Samarkand. Ibrahim was succeeded by his son, Mahmud, for a year before Ibrahim&#x27;s brother, Ali Chaghri Khan, took power. Ali wanted to avenge his brother and soon after his accession, killed one of the Karluk leaders. In early 1156, the Karluks fled to Khwarazm and sought the help of its ruler, Il-Arslan, who sent an army against Samarkand. Ali sent for help from his sovereign, the Qara Khitai, who instructed the ruler of the Eastern Karakhanids to come to his aid. The Eastern Karakhanids sent 10,000 riders to reinforce Samarkand, however the Khwarazmian force was too large to comfortably engage, and a truce was achieved with the help of religious dignitaries. The Karluks were reinstalled to their former posts and Il-Arslan returned to Khwarazm. The Karluks continued to cause trouble for Samarkand until the Qara Khitai ordered the Western Karakhanids to drive them from Bukhara and Samarkand to Kashgar. Mas&#x27;ud Tabghach Khan, the brother of Ibrahim, took the occasion to purge Transoxiana of the Karluks.

===Yel√º Pusuwan (r. 1164‚Äì1177)===
Yel√º Pusuwan (r. 1164‚Äì1177) was explicitly chosen for succession by her brother, Yel√º Yilie. Known as Empress Chengtian, Pusuwan refocused the Qara Khitai&#x27;s attention westward. In 1165, the Qara Khitai participated in Mas&#x27;ud Tabghach Khan&#x27;s invasion of Balkh and Andkhud, then under Oghuz domination, and incorporated Balkh under Qara Khitai rule lasting until 1198. In 1172, the Qara Khitai crossed the Amu Darya to attack Khwarazm, whose ruler Il-Arslan had neglected to pay tribute. Il-Arslan fell ill on the way to battle and let a Karluk commander lead his forces while he remained behind. The Khwarazmian army was soundly defeated and Il-Arslan returned to Khwarazm where he died in March 1172. However no new tribute collection agreement was enforced, possibly due to satisfaction from the spoils that the Qara Khitai had already collected from their victory.

Il-Arslan&#x27;s death led to a succession struggle between his two sons in which the Qara Khitai were involved. The younger son, Sultan Shah, was enthroned with the aid of his mother, Terken Khatun, who ruled in his name. The older brother, Tekish, fled to the Qara Khitai court and asked for their support in installing him as the new ruler of Khwarazm in return for a share of its treasures and annual tribute. Pusuwan sent her husband, Xiao Duolubu, with a large army to support Tekish&#x27;s claim. Sultan Shah and his mother fled Khwarazm and Tekish was enthroned on 11 December, 1172. Terken Khatun enlisted the help of Mu&#x27;ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba, a former Seljuk amir, to fight for their cause. However he was defeated and executed in Khwarazm in July 1174. Sultan Shah and his mother then fled to Dihistan, which Tekish then conquered and put to death Terken Khatun. Sultan Shah fled to Tughan Shah, the son of Mu&#x27;ayyid, in Nishapur, and then to the Ghurids.

Tekish soon fell out with the Qara Khitai. Despite owing his crown to them, Tekish found the conduct of their emissaries to be insulting and their demands exceeding the original agreement. In the mid 1170s, Tekish killed the leader of the emissaries who was part of the Qara Khitai royal family, and ordered the Khwarazmian notables (&quot;ayan&quot;) to kill every Qara Khitai who entered Khwarazm. Pusuwan summoned Sultan Shah, who had already been in contact wih the Qara Khitai court after realizing the Ghurids would not challenge Tekish for his claim, and sent a large army with him led by her husband to oust Tekish.

During the conflict with Khwarazm, the Qara Khitai also faced rebellions by tribes to the north and east. In the early 1170s, the Qara Khitai sent an imperial son-in-law named Abensi against the Yebulian and other tribes in the north. Abensi could not defeat them and the conflict lasted until 1175. In the same year, the Naimans and Kangly surrendered to the Jin. In 1177, the Qara Khitai sent spies into Jin territory and news of them reached the Jin court. In response, the Jin resettled the Khitans in the northwest to the northeast. In addition, the border market of Suide was closed due to fear that it was being used as a hub for spies.

While her husband was away, Pusuwan developed a romantic relationship with his brother, Xiao Fuguzhi. She planned to get rid of her husband in order to spend more time with his brother, however her father-in-law caught wind of her plans and conducted a coup. Xiao Wolila surrounded the palace with his troops and killed both his son and the empress.

===Yel√º Zhilugu (r. 1177-1211)===
====Khwarazm war====
Xiao Wolila installed Yel√º Zhilugu (r. 1178‚Äì1211), the second son of Yel√º Yilie, on the throne.

At the time of Zhilugu&#x27;s accession, a large Qara Khitai army under the command of the late empress&#x27;s husband, Xiao Duolubu, was accompanying Sultan Shah to Khwarazm. Tekish managed to halt the Qara Khitai advance by flooding the Amu Darya&#x27;s dikes and blocking their path. Xiao Duolubu decided to retreat but Sultan Shah offered him a large sum in return for leaving part of his troops behind. These troops accompanied Sultan Shah to fight against the Oghuz in Khorasan. In 1181, they helped him seize Merv, Sarakhs, Nasa, and Abiward.

In 1181, the Kipchaks under Qara Ozan Khan, established in a marriage alliance with Tekish, attacked Talas in Qara Khitai territory.

In 1182, Tekish attacked Bukhara. According to his own description, the city dwellers preferred the rule of non-believers to his Muslim army. Tekish captured the city but it is uncertain how long he held it. The lack of references as well as dismissive portrayal of his time there, referred to as &quot;the business in Transoxania,&quot; probably implies a short duration. By 1193, Bukhara was again ruled by the Karakhanid vassal of the Qara Khitai. Praises of Ibrahim Arslan Khan, the Karakhanid ruler, were sung by the Bukharan &quot;sadr&quot; around this time.

The conflict between Tekish and his brother Sultan Shah continued in Khorasan until 1193 when Sultan Shah died. Although Tekish took precautions to guard the Amu Darya against Qara Khitai support of his brother during the conflict, the Qara Khitai offered no further responses to the matter. It is likely that there was a rapprochement between Tekish and the Qara Khitai court before 1194 and at the very latest before 1198, when the Qara Khitai aided Tekish against the Ghurids. The cessation of hostilities was probably a financial agreement as several Muslim sources assert that Tekish dutifully paid tribute to the Qara Khitai and ordered his son to continue to do so.

====Tribal conflict====
In the east, there is some vague evidence according to Song dynasty spy reports that the Qara Khitai had tried to ally with the Tangut Western Xia dynasty to attack the Jin in 1185. Although nothing came of it, the Jin evidently took the Qara Khitai threat seriously. In 1188, Wanyan Xiang, a leading Jin official, came back from a tribute collecting mission among the northern tribes and presented to the emperor a detailed program and map to prevent their subjects from defecting to the Qara Khitai. Wanyan Xiang was promoted for his contributions. In 1190, one of the Qara Khitai subject tribes surrendered to the Jin, which may have been the result of this new policy.

In the early 1190s, the khan of the Keraites, Toghrul, fled to the Qara Khitai seeking military support after he was ousted by his own family. When no support was forthcoming, Toghrul returned to Mongolia in 1196 seeking Tem√ºjin&#x27;s help. Toghrul later made an alliance with the Jin, through which he received his other title, Ong Khan, in 1197.

====Ghurid war====
In 1198, Muhammad of Ghor, one of the Ghurid rulers, seized Balkh from the vassal of the Qara Khitai. The Qara Khitai were urged by the Khwarazm Shah Tekish (who was also in conflict with the Ghurids) not to let this slide, as the other Ghurid ruler Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad would seize Khwarazm and Transoxiana. The Qara Khitai invaded Ghurid lands around Kurzuban (around modern Taloqan). At first they were victorious, killing and capturing many Ghurid soldiers, but they were surprised by an attack in the night. When Ghiyath al-Din&#x27;s reinforcements arrived in the morning, the Qara Khitai army was badly defeated, suffering 12,000 losses. The Qara Khitai turned to Tekish for compensation for the damage incurred and sent Xiao Duolubu to Khwarazm to collect. Tekish in turn asked the Ghurids for help. Ghiyath al-Din agreed to help with the compensation on the condition that Tekish offered his obedience to the Caliph and returned territories taken earlier by the Qara Khitai. As a result, Khwarazm managed to provide some manner of compensation to the Qara Khitai for their losses incurred fighting against the Ghurids, using Ghurid funds. Tekish died in 1200 and his son Muhammad II of Khwarazm started his reign as a tributary of the Qara Khitai.

The Ghurids took advantage of Tekish&#x27;s death to conquer certain parts of Khorasan, including Merv and Sarakhs, where they installed Hindu Khan, Muhammad II&#x27;s nephew, as their subject. In September 1201, Muhammad II marched on Merv. Hindu Khan tried to escape to the Qara Khitai, but he was killed before reaching them. Muhammad II&#x27;s conflict with the Ghurids in Khorasan continued for several years. In 1204, Muhammad of Ghor attacked Khwarazm directly. Muhammad II hurried back to Khwarazm and opened the dikes and burned the meadows in an effort to slow the Ghurid advance. The Khwarazmian forces suffered a heavy defeat against the Ghurids near a canal east of Gurganj and Muhammad II fled to the Qara Khitai. The Qara Khitai sent to his aid a force of 10,000 or 40,000 led by Tayangu and the Karakhanid rulers Uthman ibn Ibrahim and his cousin Taj al-Din Bilge Khan, the ruler of Otrar. The Ghurids retreated south upon receiving news of Qara Khitai reinforcements.

The sequence of events after the Ghurid retreat is unclear. One version of events has the Ghurids being pursued by Khwarazmian forces until they fell into Qara Khitai hands. Another version states that the Ghurids first won a victory against the Qara Khitai before being overtaken from exhaustion. According to another version, the Ghurids split their forces while fleeing from the Khwarazmian army and the Qara Khitai caught them in the desert. The Qara Khitai then attacked the Ghurids with 20,000 horsemen while a strong wind blowing towards the Ghurids resulted in a Qara Khitai victory. All versions of events, however, agree that the Qara Khitai chased the Ghurids to Andkhud, a village between Merv and Balkh, where Muhammad of Ghor took refuge in a castle. As the Qara Khitai were about to capture him, Uthman intervened and negotiated the Ghurids&#x27; surrender. This act has been attributed to solidarity between Muslim leaders. According to one account, Uthman advised the Ghurids to move their forces in and out of the castle by night to create the appearance of reinforcements arriving, thereby boosting their negotiating position. Tayangu and the Qara Khitai agreed to let Muhammad of Ghor go in return for a ransom payment. According to one account, the payment was everything Muhammad of Ghor had in his possession, while another account states that the payment was much more modest, consisting of one elephant and an additional payment. The Ghurids kept Balkh and the Amu Darya was agreed upon as the border between the two realms.

Muhammad of Ghor later returned to avenge himself against the Qara Khitai. In the summer of 1205, the Ghurid viceroy in Balkh seized Tirmidh and destroyed a Qara Khitai army stationed there. Plans were underway for a bridge to be built across the Amu Darya to facilitate a Ghurid invasion of Transoxiana. However before any of this came to fruition, Muhammad of Ghor was killed on 13 March, 1206 and the Ghurid invasion came to an end.

====Rise of Khwarazm====
Muhammad II of Khwarazm convinced the governor of Tirmidh to surrender and returned it to Qara Khitai control. In return, the Qara Khitai recognized the Khwarazm Shah&#x27;s suzerainty over all of Khorasan.

Muhammad II saw the Qara Khitai&#x27;s recognition of his claims as a sign of weakness and started interfering in Transoxiana in 1207 when Sanjar, son of a shield maker, revolted against local leadership in Bukhara. Representatives of the Burhan family, who were responsible for tax collection, went to the Qara Khitai court for help. While the Qara Khitai reaffirmed the Burhan family&#x27;s position, they offered no concrete assistance. In the absence of Qara Khitai backing, the notables of Bukhara and Samarkand sought out Muhammad II for help. Before challenging the Qara Khitai, Muhammad II made preparations by compromising with the Ghurids on certain domains and enlisting the aid of the Karakhanid ruler Uthman ibn Ibrahim, who had been insulted by the Qara Khitai&#x27;s refusal to grant him a royal princess in marriage.

In 1207, Muhammad II entered Bukhara and exiled Sanjar to Khwarazm. The Qara Khitai sent an army against him and warfare continued for some time before Tort-Aba, the new Khwarazmian commissioner in Samarkand, and the &quot;isfahbad&quot; of Kabud-Jama (in Tabaristan) defected to the Qara Khitai. Both sides retreated but the Qara Khitai took many captives. There are accounts that Muhammad II was actually taken captive at one point but was not recognized and released.

During Muhammad II&#x27;s absence, his brother Ali Shah (viceroy in Tabaristan) and Kozli (commander in Nishapur) had tried to set themselves up as rulers of Khorasan. When Muhammad II returned, Kozli fled and both he and his son were killed soon after, and Ali Shah fled to Firuzkuh. Muhammad II restored his position in Khorasan by conquering Herat and Firuzkuh. In 1208-9, Ali Shah was executed. Khwarazm returned to paying tribute to the Qara Khitai in 1209-10 when Muhammad II was planning a campaign against the Kipchaks. Not wanting to sever relations with the Qara Khitai at that moment, Muhammad II left the matter of tribute to his mother, who welcomed the Qara Khitai emissaries with great respect. However Mahmud Tai, the Qara Khitai&#x27;s chief vizier, was unconvinced and reported that Muhammad II was unlikely to pay tribute again.

Late in the period it expanded far to the south as the Khwarezmian Empire until it was conquered by the Mongols in 1220, two years after the Qara Kitai. In the south the Kara-Khanid vassals were lightly held and engaged in various conflicts with each other, the Qara Kitai, Khwarezm and the Gurids.

====Rebellions in the east====
In 1204, the Qara Khitai put down a rebellion in Khotan and Kashgar. In 1209, Qocho rebelled against the Qara Khitai. The Qara Khitai commissioner was chased into a high building where he was put to death. The Uyghur ruler, Barchuq Art Tegin, reported the incident to the Qara Khitai, but at this point individuals at Qocho had already started defecting to the Mongols. When Genghis Khan&#x27;s messengers arrived at Qocho, the Uyghur ruler offered his allegiance to the Mongol khan. Genghis gave Barchuq his daughter in return for his attendance at court as well as a sizable tribute. In late 1209 or early 1210, when Merkit refugees arrived in Qocho, Barchuq attacked them and drove them off. He made haste to report his loyal behaviour to Genghis, accompanying it with tribute. In 1211, the Uyghur Idiqut had an audience with Genghis on the Kerulen River. In the same year, another vassal of the Qara Khitai, the Karluk Arslan Khan surrendered to Genghis.

=== Kuchlug&#x27;s usurpation and end of the Khanate ===
In 1208, a Naiman prince, Kuchlug, fled his homeland after being defeated by Mongols. Kuchlug was welcomed by the Qara Khitai, and was allowed to marry Zhilugu&#x27;s daughter. However, in 1211, Kuchlug revolted, and later captured Yel√º Zhilugu while the latter was hunting. Zhilugu was allowed to remain as the nominal ruler but died two years later, and many historians regarded his death as the end of the Qara-Khitai empire. In 1216, Genghis Khan dispatched his general Jebe to pursue Kuchlug; Kuchlug fled, but in 1218, he was finally captured and decapitated. The Mongols fully conquered the former territories of the Qara-Khitai in 1220.

=== Aftermath ===

The Qara Khitais became absorbed into the Mongol Empire; a segment of the Qara-Khitan troops had previously already joined the Mongol army fighting against Kuchlug. Another segment of the Qara-Khitans, in a dynasty founded by Buraq Hajib, survived in Kirman as a vassal of the Mongols, but ceased to exist as an entity during the reign of √ñljait√º of the Ilkhanate. The Qara-Khitans were dispersed widely all over Eurasia as part of the Mongol army. In the 14th century, they began to lose their ethnic identity, traces of their presence however may be found as clan names or toponyms from Afghanistan to Moldova. Today a Khitay tribe still lives in northern Kyrgyzstan.

== Administration ==
The Khitans ruled from their capital at Balasagun (in today&#x27;s Kyrgyzstan), directly controlling the central region of the empire. The rest of their empire consisted of highly autonomous vassalized states, primarily Khwarezm, the Karluks, the Kingdom of Qocho of the Uyghurs, the Kankalis, and the Western, Eastern, and Fergana Kara-Khanids. The late-arriving Naimans also became vassals, before usurping the empire under Kuchlug.

The Khitan rulers inherited many administrative elements from the Liao dynasty, including the use of Confucian administration and imperial trappings. The empire also adopted the title of &quot;Gurkhan&quot; (universal Khan). The Khitans used the Chinese calendar, maintained Chinese imperial and administrative titles, gave its emperors reign names, used Chinese-styled coins, and sent imperial seals to its vassals. Although most of its administrative titles were derived from Chinese, the empire also adopted local administrative titles, such as &quot;tayangyu&quot; (Turkic) and vizier.

The Khitans maintained their old customs, even in Central Asia. They remained nomads, adhered to their traditional dress, and maintained the religious practices followed by the Liao dynasty Khitans. The ruling elite tried to maintain the traditional marriages between the Yel√º king clan and the Xiao queen clan, and were highly reluctant to allow their princesses to marry outsiders. The Qara-Khitai Khitans followed a mix of Buddhism and traditional Khitan religion, which included fire worship and tribal customs, such as the tradition of sacrificing a gray ox with a white horse. In an innovation unique to the Qara Khitai, the Khitans paid each of their soldiers a salary.

The empire ruled over a diverse population that was quite different from its rulers. The majority of the population was sedentary, although the population suddenly became more nomadic during the end of the empire, due to the influx of Naimans. The majority of their subjects were Muslims, although a significant minority practiced Buddhism and Nestorianism. Although Chinese and Khitan were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and Uyghur.

== Association with China ==

In Chinese historiography, the Qara Khitai is most commonly called the &quot;Western Liao&quot; (Ë•øÈÅº) and is considered to be an orthodox Chinese dynasty, as is the case for the Liao dynasty. The history of the Qara Khitai was included in the &quot;History of Liao&quot; (one of the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot;), which was compiled officially during the Yuan dynasty by Toqto&#x27;a et al.

After the fall of the Tang dynasty, various dynasties of non-Han ethnic origins gained prestige by portraying themselves as the legitimate dynasty of China. Qara Khitai monarchs used the title of &quot;Chinese emperor&quot;, and were also called the &quot;Khan of Chƒ´n&quot;. The Qara Khitai used the &quot;image of China&quot; to legitimize their rule to the Central Asians. The Chinese emperor, together with the rulers of the Turks, Arabs, India and the Byzantine Romans, were known to Islamic writers as the world&#x27;s &quot;five great kings&quot;. Qara Khitai kept the trappings of a Chinese state, such as Chinese coins, Chinese imperial titles, the Chinese writing system, tablets, seals, and used Chinese products like porcelain, mirrors, jade and other Chinese customs. The adherence to Liao Chinese traditions has been suggested as a reason why the Qara Khitai did not convert to Islam. Despite the Chinese trappings, there were comparatively few Han Chinese among the population of the Qara Khitai. These Han Chinese had lived in Kedun during the Liao dynasty, and in 1124 migrated with the Khitans under Yel√º Dashi along with other people of Kedun, such as the Bohai, Jurchen, and Mongol tribes, as well as other Khitans in addition to the Xiao consort clan.

Qara Khitai&#x27;s rule over the Muslim-majority Central Asia has the effect of reinforcing the view among some Muslim writers that Central Asia was linked to China even though the Tang dynasty had lost control of the region a few hundred years before. Marwazƒ´ wrote that Transoxania was a former part of China, while Fakhr al-Dƒ´n MubƒÅrak ShƒÅh defined China as part of &quot;Turkestan&quot;, and the cities of BalƒÅsƒÅgh≈´n and Kashghar were considered part of China.

=== Legacy ===
The association of Khitai with China meant that the most enduring trace of the Khitan&#x27;s power is names that are derived from it, such as Cathay, which is the medieval Latin appellation for China. Names derived from Khitai are still current in modern usage, such as the Russian, Bulgarian, Uzbek and Mongolian names for China. However, the use of the name Khitai to mean &quot;China&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; by Turkic speakers within China, such as the Uyghurs, is considered pejorative by the Chinese authorities, who tried to ban it.

== Seals ==


In Autumn of the year 2019 a Chinese type bronze seal was discovered near a Caravanserai that was located near the Ustyurt Plateau. This seal has a weight of 330 grams and has the dimensions of 50x52x13 millimeters with a handle that is 21 millimeters in height. The inscription of the seal is written in Khitan large script and contains 20 characters. This was the first seal that could be confidently attributed to the a Western Liao period as it is attributed to have been created during the 3rd month of the year Tianxi 20 (or the year 1197 in the Gregorian calendar) during the reign of Emperor Yel√º Zhilugu. The discovery of this seal further indicated that the Qara Khitai Khanate adopted the Chinese administrative practice, as such seals were commonly used in the Imperial Chinese government apparatus. 

As of 2020 it is unclear if the same regulations on seals existed in Qara Khitai as did in imperial China and if the sizes of Western Liao seals were standardised or not.

<text>USS &quot;Bairoko&quot; was a of the United States Navy in service from 1945 to 1955. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33¬†planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Bairoko&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
===Construction and early career===
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship was originally named &quot;Portage Bay&quot;, but on 5 June 1944, before construction of the ship began, she was renamed &quot;Bairoko&quot; after the battles fought around Bairoko Harbor during the Solomon Islands campaign; American forces captured the harbor in August 1943. The ship was laid down at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington, on 25 July 1944. She was launched on 25 January 1945 and was commissioned on 16 July 1945. &quot;Bairoko&quot; then completed fitting out work before conducting her shakedown cruise in Puget Sound. She sailed for San Diego, California, in early August. After arrival, her new complement of aircraft carried out flight training for the rest of the month. She was finally ready for service on 3 September, the day after the surrender of Japan formally ended World War II. The ship then went into the shipyard at San Pedro for repairs that lasted for four weeks.

On 18 October, &quot;Bairoko&quot; left San Pedro for a lengthy cruise in the western Pacific. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way, staying there for about two weeks before departing on 7 November. While en route, her orders were changed, directing her to join her sister ships and in the Mariana Islands in the central Pacific. She arrived there on 24 November, and the three carriers, joined by four destroyer escorts, formed a task group and sailed for Hong Kong on 30 November. The carriers conducted combined air training exercises while on the way. After arriving, the ships underwent maintenance for a week and then departed on 21 December, bound for Manila, the Philippines. The group arrived two days later, and remained in port there until 30 December, when they departed for Guam. There, &quot;Bairoko&quot; left the rest of the ships and sailed back to California alone. She reached San Diego on 25 January 1946.

===1946‚Äì1949===
On 1 February, &quot;Bairoko&quot; returned to Tacoma for modifications to allow her to operate jet aircraft. Work on the ship lasted for three weeks, after which she participated in pilot qualification training in Puget Sound. She arrived back in San Diego on 3 March, where she took on sixteen Ryan FR-1 Fireball jet-and-piston fighters of VF-41 squadron. &quot;Bairoko&quot; carried out fight testing of the new aircraft until 26 April, when the ship was removed from active service due to crew shortages. She remained confined to port until 15 September, when she was reactivated. The ship went to sea next on 15 October for general training exercises. She sailed for San Pedro on 26 October for another round of modifications that lasted for three months. The ship was back in service by 24 January 1947, and she cruised in the local area until 17 February, when she departed for Pearl Harbor to take on a load of aircraft she was to ferry to other carriers participating in fleet problem 2-47, which was held between 2 and 9 March. &quot;Bairoko&quot; then returned the planes to San Diego after the maneuvers, arriving there on 20 March.

The ship next got underway on 7 April, this time to ferry aircraft to China. She stopped in Guam on 27 April and embarked Marine squadron VMF-218, which was equipped with twenty Vought F4U Corsair fighters. &quot;Bairoko&quot; stopped in Shanghai, China, on 8 May and the marines flew off their aircraft the following day. The planes were to be transferred to VMF-211, which was based in Qingdao, China. &quot;Bairoko&quot; meanwhile departed for Okinawa, thereafter proceeding home on 13 May. She stopped in Guam and Pearl Harbor on the way, before ultimately arriving in San Diego at the end of May. She spent the rest of the year participating in anti-submarine exercises off the coast of California. On 21 November, during one of the maneuvers, a land-based Lockheed P-2 Neptune accidentally crashed, prompting a search and rescue effort for the crew. &quot;Bairoko&quot;‚Ä≥s boats picked up an observer and the co-pilot, but the other ten men aboard the plane were killed in the accident.

&quot;Bairoko&quot; moved to San Pedro on 7 January 1948 for further modifications, this time receiving a decontamination center on her hangar deck and a repair facility for scientific instruments. These changes were in preparation for Operation Sandstone, a series of three nuclear weapons tests conducted in Eniwetok Atoll. The ship left San Pedro on 17 February, carrying a load of reconnaissance planes, support helicopters, and scientists from the Radiological Safety Group. The ship arrived in Eniwetok on 17 March for the tests, which were carried out on 15 April, 1 May, and 15 May. For each blast, &quot;Bairoko&quot; anchored some from the hypocenter so that observers could photograph the tests. Her helicopters and boats were then sent out to collect soil samples and radiation readings in the area. Her crew also assisted with the decontamination of equipment used in the tests. By early June, the ship had returned to San Diego.

The ship spent the rest of the year conducting, pilot qualifications, anti-submarine training exercises, and other maneuvers off the coast of California. As naval budgets were being reduced by late 1948, &quot;Bairoko&quot; was ordered to proceed to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard to be deactivated. On 14 April 1950, she was decommissioned and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===Korean War===
====First deployment====
&quot;Bairoko&quot;‚Ä≥s period in reserve proved to be short, as North Korean forces invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, and two days later, the US led the United Nations to intervene on the side of South Korea. &quot;Bairoko&quot; was recommissioned on 12 September, initially to train pilots and transport them and their aircraft to the war zone. The ship moved to Alameda, California for fitting out, after which she embarked VMF-311 to transport them to Korea. She reached Japan on 29 September, where VMF-311 left the ship, to be replaced by the anti-submarine squadron VS-21. The ship thereafter began anti-submarine patrols in the Yellow Sea to guard against a potential Soviet entrance into the war. She performed this role for the following five months, making a total of twelve week-long patrols in the area. During these operations, she also participated in anti-submarine training with American submarines.

On 10 May 1951, while in Yokosuka, Japan, an explosion rocked the ship, starting a major fire in her hangar that quickly spread to the engine room. Five men were killed in the blaze, which badly damaged the ship, destroying ventilation and electrical systems and weakening internal bulkheads. She underwent repairs in Yokosuka, which lasted until late June. By 3 July, she was ready to resume operations in the Yellow Sea. &quot;Bairoko&quot; took the sixteen TBM-3 Avengers from VS-23 the same day, though the ship remained in the region for just four more weeks, departing for California on 4 August. She arrived in San Diego on 15 August and remained there for nearly a month. She went to sea on 10 September for ten weeks of training operations with VS-25 off San Diego, including anti-submarine practice and night flight operations with Grumman AF Guardian patrol aircraft. The ship left California on 1 December to begin another deployment to Korean waters.

====Second deployment====
&quot;Bairoko&quot; arrived in Yokosuka on 16 December and then left for Okinawa on 28 December. But while leaving Yokosuka, she struck a mooring buoy and bent two of the blades on her starboard propeller. The ship had to be dry docked for repairs. She finally arrived at Okinawa on 5 January 1952, where she spent the following two weeks carrying out training for VS-25. The ship then embarked VMF-312 on 11 February in preparation for combat operations in Korea. Five days later, she arrived in her patrol area in the Yellow Sea, escorted by the British destroyers and . The ship&#x27;s fighters carried out patrols over southern North Korea over the next nine days, attacking any targets of opportunity they encountered, including bridges, gun positions, and supply vehicles. The Corsairs of VMF-312 flew some 121¬†combat sorties during the nine days. On 25 February, &quot;Bairoko&quot; returned to Sasebo to refuel and replenish ammunition and supplies.

The ship returned to the Yellow Sea for another patrol from 5 to 13 March; after refueling again, she embarked on a third patrol from 23 March to 1 April. The ship&#x27;s aircraft repeated their activities from the first patrol in February, though the operational tempo was lower; her pilots totaled 139¬†sorties between the second and third patrols. Over the course of these operations, five of her planes were shot down; one pilot was killed, another was rescued by the British frigate , and the remaining three were picked up by search and rescue helicopters. &quot;Bairoko&quot; replenished at Sasebo in early April before resuming operations in the Yellow Sea on 9 April. VMF-312 flew a total of 165¬†sorties over the following eight days, striking a variety of North Korean targets and losing only two aircraft; only one was shot down by North Korean fire. The second crashed on attempting to land on &quot;Bairoko&quot;. Both pilots survived the incidents.

On 18 April, the British aircraft carrier arrived to relieve &quot;Bairoko&quot; off the western coast of Korea, allowing the latter vessel to return to Japan. There, she received minor repairs, and on 2 May, VS-25 returned to the ship for anti-submarine exercises held off Okinawa. On 24 May, the ship sailed back to Yokosuka, where she refueled before departing for the United States. She passed through Pearl Harbor on the way to San Diego, where she arrived on 10 June. The ship was then dry docked at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for an extensive overhaul to repair her propulsion machinery, which was worn out after her long tour in East Asia. On 1 October, &quot;Bairoko&quot; emerged from the shipyard and sailed for San Diego three days later. For the rest of the year, she took part in local training exercises, including air search practice and joint anti-submarine warfare training with destroyer escorts. In late October, she was present to observe test firings of the new RIM-8 Talos guided missile then under development.

====Third deployment====
On 12 January 1953, &quot;Bairoko&quot; steamed out of San Diego to begin her third and final deployment to the Korean theater of operations. She stopped in Pearl Harbor six days later and remained there for a week before resuming her voyage. The ship also passed through Guam and Okinawa, before ultimately arriving in Yokosuka on 18 February. She initially returned to Okinawa for anti-submarine training in company with a group of destroyer escorts from 7th Fleet. &quot;Bairoko&quot; arrived in the Yellow Sea on 14 May, ready to begin air operations against North Korean forces. Once again carrying VMA-312, the carrier launched a total of 183¬†sorties during this period, which included raids on enemy positions, aerial reconnaissance, and combat air patrols. The ship then returned to Sasebo for supplies. Over the period from 30 May to 27 July, the ship made a further four patrols in the Yellow Sea, each following a similar pattern. In addition, her aircraft supported partisans fighting behind the lines, and from 17 to 26 June, they covered the evacuation effort for those partisans and their families. The ship&#x27;s combat operations in Korea ended on 27 July, the day the Korean Armistice Agreement ended the fighting. For the ship&#x27;s service during the war, &quot;Bairoko&quot; received three battle stars.

===Later career===
The ship left Japan on 7 August, bound for California. She stopped in Pearl Harbor to disembark some of her aircraft, before proceeding on to San Diego. After arriving there on 24 August, she moved once again to the Long Island Naval Shipyard for an overhaul and modifications. The work lasted some seven weeks, after which &quot;Bairoko&quot; returned to San Diego to begin preparations for her role in Operation Castle, a major nuclear weapons test at Eniwetok and Bikini Atoll that included a series of six detonations. The ship spent the rest of 1953 and early 1954 loading radiological equipment and observation aircraft, including six photo-reconnaissance Corsairs from VC-3 and twelve helicopters from HMR-362. On 9 January, the ship got underway for the Marshall Islands.

On 20 January, &quot;Bairoko&quot; arrived in Kwajalein, where she provided air transport to workers who were preparing facilities for the tests on Bikini and Eniwetok. Her aircraft flew observation missions during the blasts to conduct radiological surveys of the area, and the ship herself served as a decontamination center. On 1 March, the Castle Bravo detonation significantly exceeded expectations, showering &quot;Bairoko&quot;‚Äîwhich was some away‚Äîwith highly radioactive nuclear fallout. The ship&#x27;s ventilation system was sealed to prevent contamination, but sixteen of her crew were nevertheless exposed to the radioactive dust and received radiation burns. The fallout also reached the Japanese fishing boat &quot;Daigo Fukury≈´ Maru&quot;, which was about away, and burned 23 of her crew. &quot;Bairoko&quot; remained in the area for the remaining five tests, and on 16 May, she departed for home, arriving on 28 May.

For the next month and a half, &quot;Bairoko&quot; participated in training exercises off San Diego. On 17 July, she returned to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for the last time, to be overhauled prior to assignment to the reserve. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. She was moved to the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 8 October for additional inactivation work. She was eventually decommissioned on 18 February 1955 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, which was based in San Francisco. She was reclassified as an aircraft ferry with the hull number AKV-15 on 7 April 1959, but she saw no further active service. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory for another three years before being struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 April 1960. She was then sold to the Hyman-Michaels Company on 10 August to be broken up.

<doc id="188126" wikidata="Q1269091" url="?curid=188126" title="Samson of Dol">
<text>Samson of Dol (also Samsun; born late 5th century) was a Welsh saint, who is also counted among the seven founder saints of Brittany with Pol Aurelian, Tugdual or Tudwal, Brieuc, Malo, Patern (Paternus) and Corentin. Born in southern Wales, he died in Dol-de-Bretagne, a small town in north Brittany, and was the nephew of Athrwys ap Meurig.

==Life==
The primary source for his biography is the &quot;Vita Sancti Samsonis&quot;, written sometime between 610 and 820 and clearly based on earlier materials. It gives useful details of contacts between churchmen in Britain, Ireland and Brittany.

Samson was the son of Amon of Demetia and Anna of Gwent. His father&#x27;s brother married his mother&#x27;s sister so that their son Maglor was Samson&#x27;s cousin twice over. Due to a prophecy concerning his birth his parents placed him under the care of Illtud, Abbot of Llantwit Fawr, where he was raised and educated.

Samson later sought a greater austerity than his school provided, and so moved to Llantwit&#x27;s daughter house, the island monastery of Caldey off the coast of Dyfed (Pembrokeshire), Wales, where he became abbot after the death of Pyr. Samson abstained from alcohol ‚Äì unlike Pyr, who was killed when he fell down a well while drunk. As a cenobitic and later an eremitic monk, he travelled from Caldey to Ireland, where he is said to have founded or revived a monastery.

There is one fairly certain date recorded of Samson&#x27;s life; that he was ordained bishop by Bishop Dubricius on the Feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (22 February) at the beginning of Lent, which can be calculated to have fallen in the year 521. If, as is usual, he was 35 years old at the time then he would have been born in 486.
Iolo Morganwg was responsible for the re-discovery of the Samson Pillar at St Illtud&#x27;s Church, Llantwit, in about 1789, but his suggestion that it was erected by Samson himself was discredited by later historians with access to more reliable written sources. However, in the 20th century, genealogical studies threw further light on the subject, and the pillar is now considered by many to be &quot;one of the oldest inscribed Christian monuments in Britain&quot;. Legend has it that Saint Samson of Dol was threshing corn in Penparcau, Ceredigion on the hillside of Pen Dinas (a Celtic Hillfort) when the larger part of his flail broke and landed across the valley in the Abbey at Llanbadarn Fawr, in anger he threw the smaller part over the valley too and these were used to make the three celtic crosses which now stand in the church.

Later he travelled to Cornwall (where he founded a community in either South Hill or Golant), then the Scilly Isles (where the island of Samson is named after him), Guernsey where he is the Patron Saint and Brittany, where he founded the monastery of Dol. He organised the excommunication of King Conomor and successfully petitioned the Merovingian king Childebert I on behalf of Judael, Conomor&#x27;s estranged son (c. 540‚Äì60). He is recorded as having attended a council in Paris sometime between 556 and 573, by which time he would have been old. He was buried with his cousin Magloire in the cathedral of Dol.

The Anglo-Saxon King Athelstan (r. 924‚Äì939) obtained several relics of Samson, including an arm and a crozier, which he deposited at his monastery at Milton Abbas in Dorset.

==Roman Martyrology==
In the 2004 edition of the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; of the Catholic church, Samson is listed under 28 July. He is mentioned as follows: &quot;At Dol in Brittany (died) Samson, abbot and bishop, who having learned the Gospel and monastic discipline in Wales from Illtud, spread these in Domnon√©e.&quot; He does not appear in the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar of saints celebrated annually in Wales.

<doc id="188144" wikidata="Q485552" url="?curid=188144" title="Samguk sagi">
<text>Samguk sagi () is a historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla. Completed in 1145, it is well-known in Korea as the oldest surviving chronicle of Korean history.

The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; is written in Classical Chinese, the written language of the literati of ancient Korea. Its compilation was ordered by King Injong of Goryeo (r. 1122‚Äì1146) and undertaken by a government official and historian named Kim Bu-sik with his team of junior scholars. The document has been digitized by the National Institute of Korean History and is available online with Modern Korean translation in Hangul.

==Description==
&quot;Samguk sagi&quot; is critical to the study of Korean history during the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla periods. Not only because this work, and its Buddhist counterpart &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, are the only remaining Korean sources for the period, but also because the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; contains a large amount of information and details. For example, the translation tables given in Books 35 and 36 have been used for a tentative reconstruction of the former Goguryeo language.

=== Background ===
There were various motivating factors behind the compilation of the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; in the 12th century. These may roughly be categorized as ideological and political. The ideological factors are made manifest in the work&#x27;s preface, written by Kim Busik, where the civil historian states,

&quot;Of today&#x27;s scholars and high-ranking officials, there are those who are well-versed and can discuss in detail the Five Classics and the other philosophical treatises... as well as the histories of Qin and Han, but as to the events of our country, they are utterly ignorant from beginning to end. This is truly lamentable.&quot;

=== Sources for the text ===
The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; was written on the basis of the &quot;Gu Samguksa&quot; (Ëàä‰∏âÂúãÂè≤, Old History of the Three Kingdoms), and other earlier historical records such as the &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot; (Ëä±ÈÉû‰∏ñË®ò, Annals of Hwarang), most of which are no longer extant.

Concerning external sources, no references are made to the Japanese chronicles, like the &quot;Kojiki&quot; or the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, chronicles of Japan that were respectively released in 712 and 720. It is possible Kim Busik was ignorant of them, or scorned to quote a Japanese source. In contrast, he lifts generously from the Chinese dynastic chronicles and even unofficial Chinese records, most prominently the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, &quot;Sanguo Zhi&quot;, &quot;Jin Shu&quot;, &quot;Jiu Tangshu&quot;, &quot;Xin Tangshu&quot;, and the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;.

==Contents==

<doc id="188145" wikidata="Q1053626" url="?curid=188145" title="They Might Be Giants (album)">
<text>They Might Be Giants, sometimes called The Pink Album, is the debut studio album from Brooklyn-based band They Might Be Giants. It was released by Bar/None in 1986. The album generated two singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; and &quot;(She Was A) Hotel Detective&quot;. It is included on &quot;&quot;, a compilation of the band&#x27;s early material, in its entirety, with the exception of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot;, which is replaced with the single mix for the compilation.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s two singles, is often cited as a key track in the band&#x27;s catalogue, and its success contributed positively to the sale of the album. As a result of this prominence, when the band made the move to the major label Elektra Records, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; was reissued in Europe with alternative B-sides.

In July 2014, the band released a live version of the album at no charge on NoiseTrade. All the songs were recorded during the band&#x27;s 2013 tour.

==Recording==
&quot;They Might Be Giants&quot; was the second album to be released on the fledgling Bar/None label, with They Might Be Giants as the second group signed to the independent label. Many of the songs on the album existed in a demo form on the band&#x27;s 1985 demo tape, which was also technically self-titled, though many were re-recorded or given new mixes for the commercial album. The material from the tape was recorded at Studio PASS in New York City with the assistance of Alex Noyes, who permitted the band to use the studio after it closed each day. Additional recording and mixing was done at Dubway Studios.

Some unconventional recording techniques were used in the production of the album. The music is melodic, mostly uptempo synthesizer-and-guitar pop punctuated with odd sound samples and occasionally veering into sparse country- or folk-like arrangements. Drum and bass tracks are almost entirely synthesized, though the album prominently features the accordion. In order to record the guitar solo in &quot;Absolutely Bill&#x27;s Mood&quot;, the band telephoned Eugene Chadbourne in Greensboro, NC, from Dubway Studios. Chadbourne played the acoustic solo and it was recorded onto the studio&#x27;s answering machine, then mixed into the song.

Flansburgh and Linnell occasionally borrow from other recordings throughout the album. &quot;Rhythm Section Want Ad&quot; features an excerpt from Raymond Scott&#x27;s composition &quot;Powerhouse&quot;, played on the accordion. &quot;Boat of Car&quot; prominently samples the Johnny Cash song &quot;Daddy Sang Bass&quot;.

==Release==
The record sold 10,000 copies in its first year. After Bar/None founders Tom Prendergast and Glenn Morrow got TMBG airplay on MTV, sales dramatically increased. According to Prendergast, &quot;Within another month, we sold another 40,000 records.&quot; Total sales eventually passed 100,000, and a follow-up album, also on Bar/None, more than doubled the sales of the first. &quot;That established the label,&quot; Prendergast said.

==Promotion and packaging==
Music videos were produced for the album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; and &quot;(She Was A) Hotel Detective&quot;, both directed by Adam Bernstein. Significantly, prior to the album&#x27;s release, a music video was also created for the song &quot;Put Your Hand Inside the Puppet Head&quot;. This was the first commercial video ever shot by the band, and was also directed by Bernstein. A music video was also shot for the song &quot;Rabid Child&quot;, but it was never released and remains largely unavailable for public viewing to this day.

The album&#x27;s cover art was illustrated by Rodney Alan Greenblat, who had no prior association with the band. It extends to the back cover of the album, and shows John Linnell and John Flansburgh riding a large blue dog. John Linnell commented that the illustration caused the record to be mistaken for a children&#x27;s album. The art was pasted up by John Flansburgh.

==Reception==

The album was received with positive critical attention. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, who gave the album an A, praised the album for its wide range of variety and cleverness, saying &quot;the hits just keep on coming in an exuberantly annoying show of creative superabundance.&quot; He also made note of the unusualness of the subject matter contained in the lyrics. Jim Farber of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stressed the album&#x27;s &quot;weirdness,&quot; and also noted the diversity in style among songs that &quot;incorporate genres from art pop to country to polka.&quot;

Neither the album nor its singles saw success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, but the three music videos associated with the album generated positive attention for the band.

<doc id="188154" wikidata="Q446396" url="?curid=188154" title="Maurice Gee">
<text>Maurice Gough Gee (born 22 August 1931) is a New Zealand novelist. He is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most distinguished and prolific authors, having written over thirty novels for adults and children, and has won numerous awards both in New Zealand and overseas, including multiple top prizes at the New Zealand Book Awards, the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in the UK, the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship, the Robert Burns Fellowship and a Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement. In 2003 he was recognised as one of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest living artists across all disciplines by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand, which presented him with an Icon Award. 

Gee&#x27;s novel &quot;Plumb&quot; (1978) was described by the &quot;Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; to be one of the best novels ever written in New Zealand. He is also well-known for children&#x27;s and young adult fiction such as &quot;Under the Mountain&quot; (1979). He has won multiple top prizes at the New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults and in 2002 he was presented with the prestigious Margaret Mahy Award by the Children&#x27;s Literature Foundation in recognition of his contributions to children&#x27;s literature.

==Early life and education==
Gee was born in WhakatƒÅne, and brought up in Henderson, a suburb of Auckland, a location that frequently features in his writing. His mother, Harriet Lyndahl Gee (), was a socialist and an aspiring writer who had some of her work published, including a children&#x27;s picture book called &quot;Mihi and the Last of the Moas&quot; (1943), and his father, Leonard Gee, was a carpenter. He was the middle child of their three sons. Gee was also the grandson of controversial Presbyterian-turned-Unitarian minister James Chapple, later to be the inspiration for Gee&#x27;s character George Plumb in his &quot;Plumb&quot; trilogy (1978).

Gee attended Henderson Primary School and Avondale College, and completed BA and MA degrees at the University of Auckland, which subsequently recognised him with a Distinguished Alumni Award in 1998, and an honorary Doctorate of Literature in 2004. He also received an honorary Doctorate of Literature from Victoria University of Wellington in 1987.

==Literary career==
===Early career: 1950 to 1977===
Gee began writing at university, and had short stories published in New Zealand journals &quot;Landfall&quot; and &quot;Mate&quot;. After finishing his MA he taught in the secondary department of Paeroa District High School for about 18 months, starting in February 1955, but resigned in July 1956 to focus on his writing. In January 1960 and December 1961 he was awarded literary grants by the New Zealand Literary Fund.

His first published novel was &quot;The Big Season&quot; (1962), a novel about a rugby player who becomes interested in a burglar and the burglar&#x27;s girlfriend. It had themes of violence and tension, and was described by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; as &quot;not always pleasant, but certainly forceful and sincere&quot;. Gee himself was a keen rugby player and the games in the novel were inspired by his own experiences. In 1964, Gee was the sixth recipient of the Robert Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago, one of New Zealand&#x27;s most prestigious literary awards. During this fellowship he wrote his second novel, &quot;A Special Flower&quot; (1965). After the fellowship he trained as a librarian and in the 1960s and 1970s worked at the Alexander Turnbull Library, the Napier library and several libraries in Auckland.

His third novel, &quot;In My Father&#x27;s Den&quot;, a mystery novel, was published in 1972. This novel was later adapted into the critically acclaimed film of the same name by director Brad McGann in 2004. Gee followed this novel with a collection of short stories, &quot;A Glorious Morning, Comrade&quot; (1974), which won the prize for fiction at the 1976 New Zealand Book Awards, and a further novel &quot;Games of Choice&quot; (1976).

===&quot;Plumb&quot; and children&#x27;s fiction: 1978 to 1991===
Gee&#x27;s novel &quot;Plumb&quot;, published in 1978, is his best-known work for adults, and is considered one of the best novels ever written in New Zealand. In 2018, fifty New Zealand literary experts voted it to be the best novel of the last fifty years. Gee has described it as his &quot;grandfather novel&quot;, with the character George Plumb closely based on his mother&#x27;s father James Chapple, particularly his early life and his trials for heresy and seditious utterance. It won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in the UK, and the top prize for fiction at both the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards and the New Zealand Book Awards in 1979. The novel and its two sequels, &quot;Meg&quot; (1981) and &quot;Sole Survivor&quot; (1983), explore the impacts of history, politics and religion on one family from the perspectives of different members. &quot;Meg&quot; won the top prize for fiction at the New Zealand Book Awards in 1982.

At this time Gee also published his first children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Under the Mountain&quot; (1979), a science fiction story set in Auckland, New Zealand, about 11-year-old twins who discover aliens under volcanic Lake Pupuke. It has remained in print since it was published and is considered a New Zealand classic. It has been adapted into a 1981 television miniseries, a 2009 film and a stage show. In 2004 &quot;Under the Mountain&quot; was the recipient of the Gaelyn Gordon Award, awarded annually to a &quot;much-loved&quot; New Zealand children&#x27;s book that did not win any awards at the time of its publication. It was followed by other children&#x27;s books, including notably the science fiction trilogy beginning with &quot;The Halfmen of O&quot; (1982), which won the AIM Children&#x27;s Book Awards Book of the Year Award in 1983, and &quot;Motherstone&quot; (1985), which was awarded the Esther Glen Award by LIANZA.

In order to improve his income, Gee began working in television writing, including writing for 11 episodes of soap opera &quot;Close to Home&quot; and episodes of police drama &quot;Mortimer&#x27;s Patch&quot;. Two of his children&#x27;s books, &quot;The Fire-Raiser&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Champion&quot; (1989) originated as television projects. &quot;The Champion&quot; was shortlisted for the 1990 Esther Glen Award. In 1987 he was recognised by Victoria University of Wellington with the award of an honorary Doctorate of Literature, and in 1989 he held a Victoria University writing fellowship. Around this time he wrote two adult novels set in Nelson: &quot;Prowlers&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Burning Boy&quot; (1990). &quot;The Burning Boy&quot; was awarded the top prize for fiction at the 1991 New Zealand Book Awards.

===Later career and legacy: 1992 to present===

The publication of Gee&#x27;s tenth novel, &quot;Going West&quot; (1992), cemented his reputation as one of the best writers in New Zealand. It is the most autobiographical of Gee&#x27;s fictional novels, and the fictional town of Loomis, in which the novel is set, has many similarities to Henderson, Auckland, where Gee grew up. The novel was the inspiration for the Going West Books &amp; Writers Festival, Auckland&#x27;s first literary festival, which has been held since 1996. It won the top prize for fiction at the 1993 Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards. In 1993, Andro Linklater, writing in British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, said that &quot;Gee deserves to be regarded as one of the finest writers at work, not only in New Zealand ... but in the English speaking world&quot;.

Gee was the 1992 recipient of the Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship, a literary fellowship that enables the recipient to work in Menton, France, for part of the year, where Katherine Mansfield herself lived and worked in the early 20th century. During his time in Menton, Gee wrote the novel &quot;Crime Story&quot;, which was published in 1994. A decade later it was adapted by Larry Parr into the 2004 film &quot;Fracture&quot;. The film was praised by Christchurch newspaper &quot;The Press&quot; as &quot;competent, confident and complex&quot;.

&quot;The Fat Man&quot; (1994) won the AIM Children&#x27;s Book of the Year award and the Esther Glen Award. It was controversial for its content and portrayal of violence, with Gee himself describing it as a &quot;psychological thriller for children&quot;. In 1998 he published &quot;Live Bodies&quot;, a novel for adults that was awarded both the top prize for fiction and the Deutz Medal at the Montana New Zealand Book Awards that year. Other notable works in the late 1990s included the children&#x27;s books &quot;Orchard Street&quot; (1998) and &quot;Hostel Girl&quot; (1999). His contributions to New Zealand children&#x27;s literature were recognised by the Children&#x27;s Literature Foundation in 2002 which presented him with the prestigious Margaret Mahy Award.

In the early 2000s, Gee&#x27;s novels included &quot;Ellie and the Shadow Man&quot; (2001), which was short-listed for the Montana New Zealand Book Awards in 2002, and &quot;The Scornful Moon&quot; (2003), which was short-listed for Best Book in the South Pacific &amp; South East Asian Region of the 2004 Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize and a runner-up in the fiction category at the 2004 Montana New Zealand Book Awards. Gee also received two prestigious awards: in 2003 he was named as one of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest living artists by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand through the presentation of an Icon Award (recipients being limited to a living circle of 20), and in 2004 he received a 60,000 Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement for fiction. His 2005 novel &quot;Blindsight&quot; won the Deutz Medal, the top prize for fiction and (jointly) the Readers&#x27; Choice Award at the 2006 Montana New Zealand Book Awards. His 2007 novel &quot;Salt&quot; won the award for young adult fiction at the New Zealand Post Children&#x27;s Book Awards. &quot;Salt&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Gool&quot;, were both listed as Storylines Notable Young Adult Fiction Books. The third novel in the trilogy, &quot;The Limping Man&quot; (2010), was a finalist in the young adult fiction category at the New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults. In 2012, he was the inaugural Honoured New Zealand Writer at the Auckland Writers &amp; Readers Festival.

In 2015, Rachel Barrowman&#x27;s biography of Gee, &quot;Maurice Gee: Life and Work&quot;, was published by Victoria University Press. The book was critically well-received, and Gee said Barrowman&#x27;s research was &quot;thorough, unrelenting, illuminating ‚Äî illuminating even for me&quot;. Although Gee said in 2012 that he did not expect to write another novel, &quot;The Severed Land&quot; was published in 2017, and received the top award for young adult fiction at the New Zealand Book Awards for Children and Young Adults in that same year. 

In 2018 Gee published his memoir &quot;Memory Pieces&quot;. The memoir is in three parts: the first about his parents&#x27; lives, the second about his own childhood and adolescent years, and the third about his wife. He said it is &quot;almost certainly&quot; going to be his last book. It was shortlisted for the Royal Society Te ApƒÅrangi Award for General Non-Fiction at the 2019 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards.

==Style and themes==
Gee&#x27;s novels are commonly set in New Zealand, often in fictitious versions of Henderson, where he grew up. His adult novels tend to be realistic portrayals of New Zealand life, often featuring dysfunctional families and relationships, while his children&#x27;s and young adult novels tend to be fantasies or science fiction. Even in his children&#x27;s novels, his writing often features bleak or tragic moments. The &quot;Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; (2006) said that each of Gee&#x27;s novels &quot;bountifully gives us a rich vision of some region and aspect of New Zealand life, and of human life in general ... Yet there is always an awareness of living at the edge of an abyss: one false move and we shall leave this abundance for nothingness.&quot;

==Personal life==
Gee had a seven-year relationship with Hera Smith, with whom he had a son, Nigel, in September 1959. They separated in the 1960s.

Gee married his wife Margareta in 1970, having met in 1966 at the Alexander Turnbull Library where she worked. They have two adult daughters together, Abigail and Emily. Abigail works as an animator, and Emily is a writer who has published fantasy and historical novels. Gee said in 2018 that meeting Margareta changed his life: &quot;I was 38 when we got together and was drifting and wasting my time and only pretending to be a writer. She brought stability of every kind into my life ‚Äì and as I point out in &quot;Running on the Stairs&quot;, two novels and a handful of stories before meeting her, more than 30 novels since.&quot;

 he lives in Nelson with his wife and considers himself to be retired from writing.
Gee considers himself an evolutionary humanist. He is an Honorary Associate of the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists.

<text>The is the central bank of Japan. The bank is often called for short. It is headquartered in Nihonbashi, Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo.

The bank is a corporate entity independent of the Japanese government, and while it is not an administrative organisation of the state, its monetary policy falls within the scope of administration. From a macroeconomic perspective, long-term stability of prices is deemed crucial. However, the political sector tends to favour short-term measures. Thus, the bank&#x27;s autonomy and independence are granted from the standpoint of ensuring long-term public welfare and political neutrality.

==History==

===Background===
Like most modern Japanese institutions, the Bank of Japan was founded after the Meiji Restoration. Prior to the Restoration, Japan&#x27;s feudal fiefs all issued their own money, &quot;hansatsu&quot;, in an array of incompatible denominations, but the &quot;New Currency Act&quot; of Meiji 4 (1871) did away with these and established the yen as the new decimal currency, which had parity with the Mexican silver dollar. The former han (fiefs) became prefectures and their mints became private chartered banks which, however, initially retained the right to print money. For a time both the central government and these so-called national banks issued money. 

===Foundation and early development===

Finance minister Matsukata Masayoshi initially proposed the creation of the bank of Japan in March 1882, soon enacted in the Bank of Japan Act (Imperial Ordinance) of and formally founded on . The primary source of inspiration for the bank&#x27;s design was the National Bank of Belgium (est. 1850) which was viewed as one of the best-designed European central banks of its era. Since then, the Bank of Japan has been partly privately owned. Its stock is traded over the counter, hence the stock number. A number of modifications based on other national banks were encompassed within the regulations under which the bank was founded. In 1883, all national banks were stripped of their banknote issuance privilege, and the Bank of Japan was given a monopoly on controlling the money supply in 1884. Still, it would be another 20 years before all previously issued notes were retired.

Following the passage of the Convertible Bank Note Regulations (May 1884), the Bank of Japan issued its first banknotes in 1885 (&quot;Meiji 18&quot;). Despite some small glitches‚Äîfor example, it turned out that the konjac powder mixed in the paper to prevent counterfeiting made the bills a delicacy for rats‚Äîthe run was largely successful. In 1897, Japan joined the gold standard, and in 1899 the former &quot;national&quot; banknotes were formally phased out.

In the early 20th century the Bank of Japan, while a private-sector institution, worked in close coordination with the Japanese government and took direction from the minister of Finance. Its governor, as Takahashi Korekiyo put it, was considered &quot;the number-one representative of the business world&quot; in Japan&#x27;s institutional system.

===World War II and aftermath===

The Bank of Japan was reorganized in 1942 (fully only after 1 May 1942), under the , promulgated on 24 February 1942. There was a brief post-war period during the Occupation of Japan when the bank&#x27;s functions were suspended, and military currency was issued. In 1949, the bank was again restructured.

In the 1970s, the bank&#x27;s operating environment evolved along with the transition from a fixed foreign currency exchange rate and a rather closed economy to a large open economy with a variable exchange rate.

During the entire post-war era, until at least 1991, the Bank of Japan&#x27;s monetary policy has primarily been conducted via its &#x27;window guidance&#x27; (Á™ìÂè£ÊåáÂ∞é) credit controls (which are the model for the Chinese central bank&#x27;s primary tool of monetary policy implementation), whereby the central bank would impose bank credit growth quotas on the commercial banks. The tool was instrumental in the creation of the &#x27;bubble economy&#x27; of the 1980s. It was implemented by the Bank of Japan&#x27;s then &quot;Business Department&quot; (Âñ∂Ê•≠Â±Ä), which was headed during the &quot;bubble years&quot; from 1986 to 1989 by Toshihiko Fukui (who became deputy governor in the 1990s and governor in 2003).

A major 1997 revision of the Bank of Japan Act was designed to give it greater independence; however, the Bank of Japan has been criticized for already possessing excessive independence and lacking in accountability before this law was promulgated. A certain degree of dependence might be said to be enshrined in the new Law, article 4 of which states:
: &quot;In recognition of the fact that currency and monetary control is a component of overall economic policy, the Bank of Japan shall always maintain close contact with the government and exchange views sufficiently, so that its currency and monetary control and the basic stance of the government&#x27;s economic policy shall be mutually harmonious.&quot;

However, since the introduction of the new law, the Bank of Japan has rebuffed government requests to stimulate the economy.

===Boom and bust cycles===

When the Nixon shock happened in August 1971, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) could have appreciated the currency in order to avoid inflation. However, they still kept the fixed exchange rate as 360Yen/$ for two weeks, so it caused excess liquidity. In addition, they persisted with the Smithsonian rate (308Yen/$), and continued monetary easing until 1973. This created a greater-than-10% inflation rate at that time. In order to control stagflation, they raised the official bank rate from 7% to 9% and skyrocketing prices gradually ended in 1978.

In 1979, when the energy crisis happened, the BOJ raised the official bank rate rapidly. The BOJ succeeded in a quick economic recovery. After overcoming the crisis, they reduced the official bank rate. In 1980, the BOJ reduced the official bank rate from 9.0% to 8.25% in August, to 7.25% in November, and to 5.5% in December in 1981. &quot;Reaganomics&quot; was in vogue in America and USD became strong. However, Japan tried to implement fiscal reconstruction at that time, so they did not stop their financial regulation.

In 1985, the agreement of G5 nations, known as the Plaza Accord, USD slipped down and Yen/USD changed from 240yen/$ to 200yen/$ at the end of 1985. Even in 1986, USD continued to fall and reached 160yen/$. In order to escape deflation, the BOJ cut the official bank rate from 5% to 4.5% in January, to 4.0% in March, to 3.5% in April, 3.0% in November. At the same time, the government tried to raise demand in Japan in 1985, and did economy policy in 1986. However, the market was confused about the rapid fall of USD. After the Louvre Accord in February 1987, the BOJ decreased the official bank rate from 3% to 2.5%, but JPY/USD was 140yen/$ at that time and reached 125yen/$ in the end of 1987. The BOJ kept the official bank rate at 2.5% until May in 1989. Financial and fiscal regulation led to a widespread over-valuing of real estate and investments and Japan faced a bubble at that time.

After 1990, the stock market and real asset market fell. At that time BOJ regulated markets until 1991 in order to end the bubble.

In January 1995, the Great Hanshin earthquake occurred and the Japanese yen became stronger. JPY/USD reached 80yen/$, so the BOJ reduced the office bank rate to 0.5% and the yen recovered. The period of deflation started at that time.

In 1999, the BOJ started zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP), but they ended it despite government opposition when the IT bubble happened in 2000. However, Japan&#x27;s economic bubble burst in 2001 and the BOJ adopted the balance of current account as the main operating target for the adjustment of the financial market in March 2001 (quantitative relaxation policy), shifting from the zero-interest-rate policy. From 2003 to 2004, Japanese government did exchange intervention operation in huge amount, and the economy recovered a lot. In March 2006, BOJ finished quantitative easing, and finished the zero-interest-rate policy in June and raised to 0.25%.

In 2008, the financial crisis happened, and Japanese economy turned bad again. BOJ reduced the uncollateralized call rate to 0.3% and adopted the supplemental balance of current account policy. In December 2008, BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate again to 0.1% and they started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB) along with commercial paper (CP) and corporate bonds.


In 2013, the head of the BOJ (Kuroda) announced a new quantitative easing program (QE). This program would be very large in terms of quantity, but it would also be different in terms of quality‚Äîqualitative easing (QQE). In other words, the BOJ would (and did) also purchase riskier assets like stocks and REITs. In 2016, the BOJ initiated yield curve control (YCC), and started its negative interest rates policy (NIRP). The BOJ is also the largest owner of Japanese stocks. In 2024, following announcements of about 5% wage growth by Japan&#x27;s largest companies, the BOJ ended eight year of negative interest rates by setting new short term targets of 0 to 0.1%.

BOJ board member Hajime Takata indicates further interest rate hikes to address inflation concerns, though he remains cautious about their timing and scale. Markets are now anticipating a potential rate increase in the latter half of 2025.

===Curbing deflation===

Following the election of Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe in December 2012, the Bank of Japan, with Abe&#x27;s urging, took proactive steps to curb deflation in Japan. On 30 October 2012, the Bank of Japan announced that it would undertake further monetary-easing action for the second time in a month. Under the leadership of new Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, the Bank of Japan released a statement on 5 April 2013 announcing that it would be purchasing securities and bonds at a rate of 60-70 trillion yen a year in an attempt to double Japan&#x27;s money base in two years.
But by 2016, it was apparent that three years of monetary easing had had little effect on deflation so the Bank of Japan instigated a review of its monetary stimulus program.

==Operations==

=== Objectives ===
The comprehensive revision of the Bank of Japan Act in 1998 clearly defined the objectives of the Bank of Japan as &#x27;price stability&#x27; and &#x27;financial system stability&#x27;. This revision affirmed the Bank&#x27;s operation independent from the government (primarily the Ministry of Finance), and removed the provisions established in 1942, which had been problematic. The 1942 provision, enacted during the Second World War, stated the objective of the bank was to &#x27;Ensure the Appropriate Exertion of the Nation&#x27;s Total Economic Power, by Regulating Currency, Adjusting Finance, and Maintaining and Fostering the Credit System in Accordance with the Policies of the State (ÂõΩÂÆ∂ÁµåÊ∏àÁ∑èÂäõ„ÉéÈÅ©Âàá„Éä„É´Áô∫ÊèÆ„É≤Âõ≥„É´ÁÇ∫ÂõΩÂÆ∂„ÉéÊîøÁ≠ñ„ÉãÂç≥„Ç∑ÈÄöË≤®„ÉéË™øÁØÄ„ÄÅÈáëËûç„ÉéË™øÊï¥Âèä‰ø°Áî®Âà∂Â∫¶„Éé‰øùÊåÅËÇ≤Êàê„Éã‰ªª„Ç∫„É´„ÄÇ)&#x27;.

BoJ&#x27;s policies are decided at Monetary Policy Meetings (MPM, &quot;Kinyu Seisaku Kettei Kaigo&quot;, ÈáëËûçÊîøÁ≠ñÊ±∫ÂÆö‰ºöÂêà), which are attended by the Policy Board and held every other month.

==== Price stability ====
Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the inflation target. The bank aims to meet this target primarily by adjusting the base interest rate (known as the bank rate), which is decided by the Policy Board.

As of 2024 the inflation target is 2%. Japan has long suffered deflation and disinflation since the 1990s, which has been blamed as one of the main causes of the long-term economic downturn of the once world&#x27;s second largest economy. For the past two decades, the primary focus of BOJ policies has been to achieve a stable inflation.

==== Financial system stability ====
Financial system is defined as the overall structure of receipt and payment as well as lending and borrowing of money, and its stability refers to &#x27;a state in which the financial system functions properly, and participants, such as firms and individuals, have confidence in the system&#x27;.

=== Functions ===
The aforementioned objectives are realised through the exertion of the functions mentioned below.

* As the sole issuer of banknotes of Japan, BoJ carries out the issuance and management of Bank of Japan notes.
* BoJ implements monetary policy through methods such as policy interest rate (formerly known as the official discount rate) operations, open market operations, and reserve requirement ratio operations, thereby adjusting the volume of money in circulation to stabilise prices and the national economy.
* BoJ facilitates transactions among financial institutions using its current accounts, effectively acting as a &#x27;bank for banks&#x27;. (Individuals and corporations (such as general businesses) are not allowed to open accounts with BoJ.)
* BoJ serves as the government&#x27;s bank for the disbursement and receipt of public funds.
* As a &#x27;bank of banks&#x27;, BoJ ensures the stability of the financial order through smooth fund settlements via domestic exchange transactions and providing system collateral (acting as the &quot;lender of last resort&quot;) through facilities such as BoJ&#x27;s special lending programme (&quot;Nichigin Tokuyu&quot;, Êó•ÈäÄÁâπËûç). Transactions in deposits and loans are restricted to financial institutions designated in accordance with the Bank of Japan Act.
* BoJ conducts international relations activities, including interventions in the foreign exchange market, with other central banks and public institutions worldwide.
* BoJ collects and researches financial and economic information, and compiles and publishes economic statistics.

===Financial holdings===

Bank of Japan owns 4.7% of Japanese public stocks. Since 2020 it has owned more domestic stock than any other body.

==Location and branches==

The Bank of Japan is headquartered in Nihonbashi, Ch≈´≈ç, Tokyo, on the site of a former gold mint (the Kinza) and, not coincidentally, near the famous Ginza district, whose name means &quot;silver mint&quot;. The neo-baroque Bank of Japan building in Tokyo was designed by Tatsuno Kingo in 1896 and built under the direction of entrepreneur Shibusawa Eiichi. Tatsuno also designed the Bank of Japan&#x27;s branch on Nakanoshima Island in Osaka, which was completed in 1903 (and expanded in 1982). Tatsuno had been influenced by the architecture of the Bank of England and especially of the National Bank of Belgium (NBB)&#x27;s buildings in Brussels and Antwerp, paralleling the NBB&#x27;s influence on the institutional design of the Bank of Japan.

==Leadership==
The has considerable influence on the economic policy of the Japanese government.

<text>Jos√© Juli√°n Mart√≠ P√©rez (; January 28, 1853 ‚Äì May 19, 1895) was a Cuban nationalist, poet, philosopher, essayist, journalist, translator, professor, and publisher, who is considered a Cuban national hero because of his role in the liberation of his country from Spain. He was also an important figure in Latin American literature. He was very politically active and is considered an important philosopher and political theorist. Through his writings and political activity, he became a symbol of Cuba&#x27;s bid for independence from the Spanish Empire in the 19th century, and is referred to as the &quot;Apostle of Cuban Independence&quot;. From adolescence on, he dedicated his life to the promotion of liberty, political independence for Cuba, and intellectual independence for all Spanish Americans; his death was used as a cry for Cuban independence from Spain by both the Cuban revolutionaries and those Cubans previously reluctant to start a revolt.

Born in Havana, Spanish Empire, Mart√≠ began his political activism at an early age. He traveled extensively in Spain, Latin America, and the United States, raising awareness and support for the cause of Cuban independence. His unification of the Cuban √©migr√© community, particularly in Florida, was crucial to the success of the Cuban War of Independence against Spain. He was a key figure in the planning and execution of this war, as well as the designer of the Cuban Revolutionary Party and its ideology. He died in military action during the Battle of Dos R√≠os on May 19, 1895. Mart√≠ is considered one of the great turn-of-the-century Latin American intellectuals. His written works include a series of poems, essays, letters, lectures, a novel, and a children&#x27;s magazine.

He wrote for numerous Latin American and American newspapers; he also founded a number of newspapers. One of those newspapers, &quot;Patria&quot;, was an important instrument in his campaign for Cuban independence. After his death, many of his verses from the book &quot;Versos Sencillos&quot; (&quot;Simple Verses&quot;) were adapted to the patriotic song &quot;Guantanamera&quot;, which has become a prominent representative song of Cuba. The concepts of freedom, liberty and democracy are prominent themes in all of his works, which were influential on Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o and Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution, Mart√≠&#x27;s ideology became a major driving force in Cuban politics. He is also regarded as Cuba&#x27;s &quot;martyr&quot;.

==Life==

===Early life, Cuba: 1853‚Äì70===
Jos√© Juli√°n Mart√≠ P√©rez was born on January 28, 1853, in Havana, at 41 Paula Street, to Spanish parents, a Valencian father, Mariano Mart√≠ Navarro, and Leonor P√©rez Cabrera, a native of the Canary Islands. Mart√≠ was the older brother to seven sisters: Leonor, Mariana, Mar√≠a del Carmen, Mar√≠a del Pilar, Rita Amelia, Antonia and Dolores. He was baptized on February 12 in Santo √Ångel Custodio church. When he was four, his family moved from Cuba to Valencia, Spain, but two years later they returned to the island where they enrolled Jos√© at a local public school, in the Santa Clara neighborhood where his father worked as a prison guard.
In 1865, he enrolled in the Escuela de Instrucci√≥n Primaria Superior Municipal de Varones that was headed by . Mendive was influential in the development of Mart√≠&#x27;s political philosophies. Also instrumental in his development of a social and political conscience was his best friend Ferm√≠n Vald√©s Dom√≠nguez, the son of a wealthy slave-owning family. In April the same year, after hearing the news of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Mart√≠ and other young students expressed their pain‚Äîthrough group mourning‚Äîfor the death of a man who had decreed the abolition of slavery in the United States. In 1866, Mart√≠ entered the Instituto de Segunda Ense√±anza where Mendive financed his studies.

Mart√≠ signed up at the Escuela Profesional de Pintura y Escultura de La Habana (Professional School for Painting and Sculpture of Havana) in September 1867, known as Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes San Alejandro, to take drawing classes. He hoped to flourish in this area but did not find commercial success. In 1867, he also entered the school of San Pablo, established and managed by Mendive, where he enrolled for the second and third years of his bachelor&#x27;s degree and assisted Mendive with the school&#x27;s administrative tasks. In April 1868, his poem dedicated to Mendive&#x27;s wife, &quot;A Micaela. En la Muerte de Miguel √Ångel&quot; appeared in Guanabacoa&#x27;s newspaper &quot;El √Ålbum&quot;.

When the Ten Years&#x27; War broke out in Cuba in 1868, clubs of supporters for the Cuban nationalist cause formed all over Cuba, and Jos√© and his friend Ferm√≠n joined them. Mart√≠ had a precocious desire for the independence and freedom of Cuba. He started writing poems about this vision, while, at the same time, trying to do something to achieve this dream. In 1869, he published his first political writings in the only edition of the newspaper &quot;El Diablo Cojuelo&quot;, published by Ferm√≠n Vald√©s Dom√≠nguez. That same year he published &quot;Abdala&quot;, a patriotic drama in verse form in the one-volume &quot;La Patria Libre&quot; newspaper, which he published himself. &quot;Abdala&quot; is about a fictional country called Nubia which struggles for liberation. His sonnet &quot;10 de Octubre&quot;, later to become one of his most famous poems, was also written during that year, and was published later in his school newspaper.
In March of that year, colonial authorities shut down the school, interrupting Mart√≠&#x27;s studies. He came to resent Spanish rule of his homeland at an early age; likewise, he developed a hatred of slavery, which was still practiced in Cuba.

On October 21, 1869, aged 16, he was arrested and incarcerated in the national jail, following an accusation of treason and bribery from the Spanish government upon the discovery of a &quot;reproving&quot; letter, which Mart√≠ and Ferm√≠n had written to a friend when the friend joined the Spanish army. More than four months later, Mart√≠ confessed to the charges and was condemned to six years in prison. His mother tried to free her son (who at 16 was still a minor) by writing letters to the government, and his father went to a lawyer friend for legal support, but these efforts failed. Eventually, Mart√≠ fell ill; his legs were severely lacerated by the chains that bound him. As a result, he was transferred to another part of Cuba known as Isla de Pinos instead of further imprisonment. Following that, the Spanish authorities decided to exile him to Spain. In Spain, Mart√≠, who was 18 at the time, was allowed to continue his studies with the hopes that studying in Spain would renew his loyalty to Spain.
===Spain: 1871‚Äì74===

In January 1871, Mart√≠ embarked on the steam ship &quot;Guipuzcoa&quot;, which took him from Havana to C√°diz. He settled in Madrid in a guesthouse in Desenga√±o St. #10. Arriving at the capital he contacted fellow Cuban Carlos Sauvalle, who had been deported to Spain a year before Mart√≠ and whose house served as a center of reunions for Cubans in exile. On March 24, C√°diz&#x27;s newspaper &quot;La Soberania Nacional&quot;, published Mart√≠&#x27;s article &quot;Castillo&quot; in which he recalled the sufferings of a friend he met in prison. This article would be reprinted in Sevilla&#x27;s &quot;La Cuesti√≥n Cubana&quot; and New York&#x27;s &quot;La Rep√∫blica&quot;. At this time, Mart√≠ registered himself as a member of independent studies in the law faculty of the Central University of Madrid. While studying here, Mart√≠ openly participated in discourse on the Cuban issue, debating through the Spanish press and circulating documents protesting Spanish activities in Cuba.
Mart√≠&#x27;s maltreatment at the hands of the Spaniards and consequent deportation to Spain in 1871 inspired a tract, &quot;Political Imprisonment in Cuba&quot;, published in July. This pamphlet&#x27;s purpose was to move the Spanish public to do something about its government&#x27;s brutalities in Cuba and promoted the issue of Cuban independence. In September, from the pages of &quot;El Jurado Federal&quot;, Mart√≠ and Sauvalle accused the newspaper &quot;La Prensa&quot; of having calumniated the Cuban residents in Madrid. During his stay in Madrid, Mart√≠ frequented the Ateneo and the National Library, the Caf√© de los Artistas, and the British, Swiss and Iberian breweries. In November he became sick and had an operation, paid for by Sauvalle.

On November 27, 1871, eight medical students, who had been accused (without evidence) of the desecration of a Spanish grave, were executed in Havana. In June 1872, Ferm√≠n Vald√©s was arrested because of the November 27 incident. His sentence of six years of jail was pardoned, and he was exiled to Spain where he reunited with Mart√≠. On November 27, 1872, the printed matter &quot;Dia 27 de Noviembre de 1871&quot; (27 November 1871) written by Mart√≠ and signed by Ferm√≠n Vald√©s Dom√≠nguez and Pedro J. de la Torre circulated Madrid. A group of Cubans held a funeral in the Caballero de Gracia church, the first anniversary of the medical students&#x27; execution.

In 1873, Mart√≠&#x27;s &quot;A mis Hermanos Muertos el 27 de Noviembre&quot; was published by Ferm√≠n Vald√©s. In February, for the first time, the Cuban flag appeared in Madrid, hanging from Mart√≠&#x27;s balcony in Concepci√≥n Jer√≥nima, where he lived for a few years. In the same month, the Proclamation of the First Spanish Republic by the Cortes on February 11, 1873, reaffirmed Cuba as inseparable to Spain, Mart√≠ responded with an essay, &quot;The Spanish Republic and the Cuban Revolution&quot;, and sent it to the Prime Minister, pointing out that this new freely elected body of deputies that had proclaimed a republic based on democracy had been hypocritical not to grant Cuba its independence. He sent examples of his work to Nestor Ponce de Leon, a member of the Junta Central Revolucionaria de Nueva York (Central revolutionary committee of New York), to whom he would express his will to collaborate on the fight for the independence of Cuba.

In May, he moved to Zaragoza, accompanied by Ferm√≠n Vald√©s to continue his studies in law at the Universidad Literaria. The newspaper &quot;La Cuesti√≥n Cubana of Sevilla&quot;, published numerous articles from Mart√≠.

In June 1874, Mart√≠ graduated with a degree in Civil Law and Canon Law. In August he signed up as an external student at the Facultad de Filosofia y Letras de Zaragoza, where he finished his degree by October. In November he returned to Madrid and then left to Paris. There he met Auguste Vacquerie, a poet, and Victor Hugo. In December 1874, when prevented to return to Cuba, Marti went instead to Mexico, via Le Havre. During these travels, he taught and wrote, advocating continuously for Cuba&#x27;s independence.

===M√©xico and Guatemala: 1875‚Äì78===
In 1875, Mart√≠ lived on Calle Moneda in Mexico City near the Z√≥calo, a prestigious address of the time. One floor above him lived Manuel Antonio Mercado, Secretary of the Distrito Federal, who became one of Mart√≠&#x27;s best friends. On March 2, 1875, he published his first article for Vicente Villada&#x27;s &quot;Revista Universal&quot;, a broadsheet discussing politics, literature, and general business commerce. On March 12, his Spanish translation of Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Mes Fils&quot; (1874) began serialization in &quot;Revista Universal&quot;. Mart√≠ then joined the editorial staff, editing the &quot;Bolet√≠n&quot; section of the publication.

In these writings, he expressed his opinions about current events in Mexico. On May 27, in the newspaper &quot;Revista Universal&quot;, he responded to the anti-Cuban-independence arguments in &quot;La Colonia Espa√±ola&quot;, a newspaper for Spanish citizens living in Mexico. In December, Sociedad Gorostiza (Gorostiza Society), a group of writers and artists, accepted Mart√≠ as a member, where he met his future wife, Mar√≠a del Carmen Zayas-Baz√°n e Hidalgo, during his frequent visits to her Cuban father&#x27;s house to meet with the Gorostiza group.

On January 1, 1876, in Oaxaca, elements opposed to Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada&#x27;s government, led by Gen. Porfirio D√≠az, proclaimed the Plan de Tuxtepec, which instigated a bloody civil war. Mart√≠ and Mexican colleagues established the Sociedad Alarc√≥n, composed of dramatists, actors, and critics. At this point, Mart√≠ began collaborating with the newspaper &quot;El Socialista&quot; as leader of the Gran C√≠rculo Obrero (Great Labor Circle) organization of liberals and reformists who supported Lerdo de Tejada. In March, the newspaper proposed a series of candidates as delegates, including Mart√≠, to the first Congreso Obrero, or congress of the workers. On June 4, La Sociedad Esperanza de Empleados (Employees&#x27; Hope Society) designated Mart√≠ as delegate to the Congreso Obrero. On December 7, Mart√≠ published his article &quot;Alea Jacta Est&quot; in the newspaper &quot;El Federalista&quot;, bitterly criticizing the Porfiristas&#x27; armed assault upon the constitutional government in place. On December 16, he published the article &quot;Extranjero&quot; (foreigner; abroad), in which he repeated his denunciation of the Porfiristas and bade farewell to Mexico.

In 1877, using his second name and second surname Juli√°n P√©rez as pseudonym, Mart√≠ embarked for Havana, hoping to arrange to move his family away to Mexico City from Havana. He returned to Mexico, however, entering at the port of Progreso from which, via Isla de Mujeres and Belize, he travelled south to progressive Guatemala City. He took residence in the prosperous suburb of Ciudad Vieja, home of Guatemala&#x27;s artists and intelligentsia of the day, on Cuarta Avenida (Fourth Avenue), 3¬†km south of Guatemala City. While there, he was commissioned by the government to write the play &quot;Patria y Libertad (Drama Indio)&quot; (Country and Liberty (an Indian Drama)). He met personally the president, Justo Rufino Barrios, about this project. On April 22, the newspaper &quot;El Progreso&quot; published his article &quot;Los c√≥digos Nuevos&quot; (The New Laws) pertaining to the then newly enacted Civil Code. On May 29, he was appointed head of the Department of French, English, Italian and German Literature, History and Philosophy, on the faculty of philosophy and arts of the Universidad Nacional. On July 25, he lectured for the opening evening of the literary society &#x27;Sociedad Literaria El Porvenir&#x27;, at the Teatro Col√≥n (the since-renamed Teatro Nacional), at which function he was appointed vice-president of the Society, and acquiring the moniker &quot;el doctor torrente,&quot; or Doctor Torrent, in view of his rhetorical style. Mart√≠ taught composition classes free at the A&quot;cademia de Ni√±as de Centroam√©rica&quot; girls&#x27; academy, among whose students he enthralled young Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Granados y Sabor√≠o, daughter of Guatemalan president Miguel Garc√≠a Granados. The schoolgirl&#x27;s crush was unrequited, however, as he went again to M√©xico, where he met Mar√≠a del Carmen Zayas-Baz√°n e Hidalgo and whom he later married.

In 1878, Mart√≠ returned to Guatemala and published his book &quot;Guatemala&quot;, edited in Mexico. On May 10, socialite Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Granados died of lung disease; her unrequited love for Mart√≠ branded her, poignantly, as &#x27;la ni√±a de Guatemala, la que se muri√≥ de amor&#x27; (the Guatemalan girl who died of love). Following her death, Mart√≠ returned to Cuba. There, he resigned signing the Pact of Zanj√≥n which ended the Cuban Ten Years&#x27; War, but had no effect on Cuba&#x27;s status as a colony. He met Afro-Cuban revolutionary Juan Gualberto G√≥mez, who would be his lifelong partner in the independence struggle and a stalwart defender of his legacy during this same journey. He married Carmen Zayas Baz√°n on Havana&#x27;s Calle Tulip√°n Street at this time. In October, his application to practice law in Cuba was refused, and thereafter he immersed himself in radical efforts, such as for the Comit√© Revolucionario Cubano de Nueva York (Cuban Revolutionary Committee of New York). On November 22, 1878, his son Jos√© Francisco, known fondly as &quot;Pepito&quot;, was born.

===United States and Venezuela: 1880‚Äì90===
In 1881, after a brief stay in New York, Mart√≠ travelled to Venezuela and founded in Caracas the &quot;Revista Venezolana&quot;, or Venezuelan Review. The journal incurred the wrath of Venezuela&#x27;s dictator, Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, and Mart√≠ was forced to return to New York. There, Mart√≠ joined General Calixto Garc√≠a&#x27;s Cuban revolutionary committee, composed of Cuban exiles advocating independence. Here Mart√≠ openly supported Cuba&#x27;s struggle for liberation, and worked as a journalist for &quot;La Naci√≥n&quot; of Buenos Aires and for several Central American journals, especially &quot;La Opinion Liberal&quot; in Mexico City. The article &quot;El ajusticiamiento de Guiteau,&quot; an account of President Garfield&#x27;s murderer&#x27;s trial, was published in &quot;La Opinion Liberal&quot; in 1881, and later selected for inclusion in The Library of America&#x27;s anthology of American True Crime writing. In addition, Mart√≠ wrote poems and translated novels to Spanish. He worked for Appleton and Company and, &quot;on his own, translated and published Helen Hunt Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Ramona&quot;. His repertory of original work included plays, a novel, poetry, a children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;La Edad de Oro&quot;, and a newspaper, &quot;Patria&quot;, which became the official organ of the Cuban Revolutionary party&quot;. He also served as a consul for Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay. Throughout this work, he preached the &quot;freedom of Cuba with an enthusiasm that swelled the ranks of those eager to strive with him for it&quot;.

Tension existed within the Cuban revolutionary committee between Mart√≠ and his military compatriots. Mart√≠ feared a military dictatorship would be established in Cuba upon independence, and suspected Dominican-born General M√°ximo G√≥mez of having these intentions. Mart√≠ knew that the independence of Cuba needed time and careful planning. Ultimately, Mart√≠ refused to cooperate with M√°ximo G√≥mez and Antonio Maceo Grajales, two Cuban military leaders from the Ten Years&#x27; War, when they wanted to invade immediately in 1884. Mart√≠ knew that it was too early to attempt to win back Cuba, and later events proved him right.

===United States, Central America and the West Indies: 1891‚Äì94===
On January 1, 1891, Mart√≠&#x27;s essay &quot;Nuestra America&quot; was published in New York&#x27;s &quot;Revista Ilustrada&quot;, and on the 30th of that month in Mexico&#x27;s &quot;El Partido Liberal&quot;. He actively participated in the Conferencia Monetaria Internacional (The International Monetary Conference) in New York during that time as well. On June 30 his wife and son arrived in New York. After a short time, during which Carmen Zayas Baz√°n realized that Mart√≠&#x27;s dedication to Cuban independence surpassed that of supporting his family, she returned to Havana with her son on August 27. Mart√≠ would never see them again. The fact that his wife never shared the convictions central to his life was an enormous personal tragedy for Mart√≠. He turned for solace to Carmen Miyares de Mantilla, a Venezuelan who ran a boarding house in New York, and he is presumed to be the father of her daughter Mar√≠a Mantilla, who was in turn the mother of the actor Cesar Romero, who proudly claimed to be Mart√≠&#x27;s grandson. In September Mart√≠ became sick again. He intervened in the commemorative acts of The Independents, causing the Spanish consul in New York to complain to the Argentine and Uruguayan governments. Consequently, Mart√≠ resigned from the Argentinean, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan consulates. In October he published his book &quot;Versos Sencillos&quot;.
On November 26 he was invited by the &quot;Club Ignacio Agramonte&quot;, an organization founded by Cuban immigrants in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, to a celebration to collect funding for the cause of Cuban independence. There he gave a lecture known as &quot;Con Todos, y para el Bien de Todos&quot;, which was reprinted in Spanish language newspapers and periodicals across the United States. The following night, another lecture, &quot; Los Pinos Nuevos&quot;, was given by Mart√≠ in another Tampa gathering in honor of the medical students killed in Cuba in 1871. In November artist Herman Norman painted a portrait of Jos√© Mart√≠.

On January 5, 1892, Mart√≠ participated in a reunion of the emigration representatives, in Cayo Hueso (Key West), the Cuban community where the &quot;Bases del Partido Revolucionario&quot; (Basis of the Cuban Revolutionary Party) was passed. He began the process of organizing the newly formed party. To raise support and collect funding for the independence movement, he visited tobacco factories, where he gave speeches to the workers and united them in the cause. In March 1892 the first edition of the &quot;Patria&quot; newspaper, related to the Cuban Revolutionary Party, was published, funded and directed by Mart√≠. During Mart√≠&#x27;s Key West years, his secretary was Dolores Castellanos (1870‚Äì1948), a Cuban-American woman born in Key West, who also served as president of the Protectoras de la Patria: Club Pol√≠tico de Cubanas, a Cuban women&#x27;s political club in support of Mart√≠&#x27;s cause, and for whom Mart√≠ wrote a poem titled &quot;josemarti.cu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/0110_A_DOLORES _CASTELLANOS.pdf A Dolores Castellanos.&quot;

On April 8, he was elected delegate of the Cuban Revolutionary Party by the Cayo Hueso Club in Tampa and New York. From July to September 1892 he traveled through Florida, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica on an organization mission among the exiled Cubans. On this mission, Mart√≠ made numerous speeches and visited various tobacco factories. In 1893, Mart√≠ traveled through the United States, Central America and the West Indies, visiting different Cuban clubs. His visits were received with a growing enthusiasm and raised badly needed funds for the revolutionary cause. On May 24 he met Rub√©n Dar√≠o, the Nicaraguan poet in a theatre act in Hardman Hall, New York City. On June 3 he had an interview with M√°ximo G√≥mez in Montecristi, Dominican Republic, where they planned the uprising. In July he met with General Antonio Maceo Grajales in San Jose, Costa Rica.

In 1894 he continued traveling for propagation and organizing the revolutionary movement. On January 27 he published &quot;A Cuba!&quot; in the newspaper &quot;Patria&quot; where he denounced collusion between the Spanish and American interests. In July he visited the president of the Mexican Republic, Porfirio D√≠az, and travelled to Veracruz. In August he prepared and arranged the armed expedition that would begin the Cuban revolution.

===Return to Cuba: 1895===
On January 12, 1895, the North American authorities stopped the steamship &quot;Lagonda&quot; and two other suspicious ships, &quot;Amadis&quot; and &quot;Baracoa&quot;, at the port of Fernandina in Florida, confiscating weapons and ruining Plan de Fernandina (Fernandina Plan). On January 29, Mart√≠ drew up the order of the uprising, signing it with general Jose Maria Rodriguez and Enrique Collazo. Juan Gualberto G√≥mez was assigned to orchestrate war preparations for La Habana Province, and was able to work right under the noses of the relatively unconcerned Spanish authorities. Mart√≠ decided to move to Montecristi, Dominican Republic to join M√°ximo G√≥mez and to plan out the uprising.

The uprising finally took place on February 24, 1895. A month later, Mart√≠ and M√°ximo G√≥mez declared the Manifesto de Montecristi, an &quot;exposition of the purposes and principles of the Cuban revolution&quot;. Mart√≠ had persuaded G√≥mez to lead an expedition into Cuba.

Before leaving for Cuba, Mart√≠ wrote his &quot;literary will&quot; on April 1, 1895, leaving his personal papers and manuscripts to Gonzalo de Quesada, with instructions for editing. Knowing that the majority of his writing in newspapers in Honduras, Uruguay, and Chile would disappear over time, Mart√≠ instructed Quesada to arrange his papers in volumes. The volumes were to be arranged in the following way: volumes one and two, North Americas; volume three, Hispanic Americas; volume four, North American Scenes; volume five, Books about the Americas (this included both North and South America); volume six, Literature, education and painting. Another volume included his poetry.

The expedition, composed of Mart√≠, G√≥mez, √Ångel Guerra, Francisco Borreo, Cesar Salas and Marcos del Rosario, left Montecristi for Cuba on April 1, 1895. Despite delays and desertion by some members, they got to Cuba, landing at Playitas, near Cape Mais√≠ and Im√≠as, Cuba, on April 11. Once there, they made contact with the Cuban rebels, who were headed by the Maceo brothers, and started fighting against Spanish troops. The revolt did not go as planned, &quot;mainly because the call to revolution received no immediate, spontaneous support from the masses.&quot; By May 13, the expedition reached Dos Rios. On May 19, Gomez faced Ximenez de Sandoval&#x27;s troops and ordered Mart√≠ to stay with the rearguard, but Mart√≠ became separated from the bulk of the Cuban forces, and entered the Spanish line.

===Death===

Mart√≠ was killed in battle against Spanish troops at the Battle of Dos R√≠os, near the confluence of the rivers Contramaestre and Cauto, on May 19, 1895. G√≥mez had recognized that the Spaniards had a strong position between palm trees, so he ordered his men to disengage. Mart√≠ was alone and seeing a young courier ride by said, &quot;Joven, ¬°a la carga!&quot; () This was around midday, and he was dressed in a black jacket while riding a white horse, which made him an easy target for the Spanish. After Mart√≠ was shot, the young trooper, √Ångel de la Guardia, lost his horse and returned to report the loss. The Spanish took possession of the body, buried it close by, then exhumed the body upon realization of its identity. He was buried in Santa Ifigenia Cemetery in Santiago de Cuba.

The death of Mart√≠ was a blow to the &quot;aspirations of the Cuban rebels, inside and outside of the island, but the fighting continued with alternating successes and failures until the entry of the United States into the war in 1898&quot;.

==Political ideology==
===Liberalism===
Mart√≠&#x27;s political ideas were shaped by his early encounter with Krausist liberalism and its defense of spirituality and solidarity. Radical liberalism in Latin America during this time period often took on a nationalist and anti-imperialist cast, as shown by the examples of Francisco Bilbao in Chile, Benito Ju√°rez in Mexico, Jos√© Santos Zelaya in Nicaragua, and Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances in Puerto Rico, whom Mart√≠ deeply admired and considered one of his teachers. An increasingly radicalized liberalism emphasizing democratic participation, economic equality, national sovereignty, and supplemented by his exposure to doctrines such as Georgism, remained the dominant basis of Mart√≠&#x27;s outlook.

===Cuban independence===
Mart√≠ wrote extensively about Spanish colonial control and the threat of US expansionism into Cuba. To him, it was unnatural that Cuba was controlled and oppressed by the Spanish government, when it had its own unique identity and culture. In his pamphlet from February 11, 1873, called &quot;The Spanish Republic and the Cuban Revolution&quot;, he argued that &quot;Cubans do not live as Spaniards live... They are nourished by a different system of trade, have links with different countries, and express their happiness through quite contrary customs. There are no common aspirations or identical goals linking the two peoples, or beloved memories to unite them. ... Peoples are only united by ties of fraternity and love.&quot;.

===Slavery===
Mart√≠ opposed slavery and criticized Spain for upholding it. In a speech to Cuban immigrants in Steck Hall, New York, on January 24, 1879, he stated that the war against Spain needed to be fought, recalled the heroism and suffering of the Ten Years&#x27; War, which, he declared, had qualified Cuba as a real nation with a right to independence. Spain had not ratified the conditions of the peace treaty, had falsified elections, continued excessive taxation, and had failed to abolish slavery. Cuba needed to be free.

===Revolutionary tactics===
Mart√≠ proposed in a letter to M√°ximo G√≥mez in 1882 the formation of a revolutionary party, which he considered essential in the prevention of Cuba falling back on the Home Rule Party (&quot;Partido Autonomista&quot;) after the Pact of Zanj√≥n. The Home Rule Party was a peace-seeking party that would stop short of the outright independence that Mart√≠ thought Cuba needed. But he was aware that there were social divisions in Cuba, especially racial divisions, that needed to be addressed as well. He thought war was necessary to achieve Cuba&#x27;s freedom, despite his basic ideology of conciliation, respect, dignity, and balance. The establishment of the &quot;patria&quot; (fatherland) with a good government would unite Cubans of all social classes and colours in harmony. Together with other Cubans resident in New York, Mart√≠ started laying the grounds for the Revolutionary Party, stressing the need for a democratic organization as the basic structure before any military leaders were to join. The military would have to subordinate themselves to the interests of the fatherland. G√≥mez later rejoined Mart√≠&#x27;s plans, promising to comply.

Mart√≠&#x27;s consolidation of support among the Cuban expatriates, especially in Florida, was key in the planning and execution of the invasion of Cuba. His speeches to Cuban tobacco workers in Tampa and Key West motivated and united them; this is considered the most important political achievement of his life. At this point he refined his ideological platform, basing it on a Cuba held together by pride in being Cuban, a society that ensured &quot;the welfare and prosperity of all Cubans&quot; independently of class, occupation or race. Faith in the cause could not die, and the military would not try for domination. All pro-independence Cubans would participate, with no sector predominating. From this he established the Cuban Revolutionary Party in early 1892.

Mart√≠ and the CRP were devoted to secretly organizing the anti-Spanish war. Mart√≠&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Patria&quot;, was a key instrument of this campaign, where Mart√≠ delineated his final plans for Cuba. Through this medium he argued against the exploitative colonialism of Spain in Cuba, criticized the Home Rule (&quot;Autonomista&quot;) Party for having aims that fell considerably short of full independence, and warned against U.S. annexationism which he felt could only be prevented by Cuba&#x27;s successful independence. He specified his plans for the future Cuban Republic, a multi-class and multi-racial democratic republic based on universal suffrage, with an egalitarian economic base to develop fully Cuba&#x27;s productive resources and an equitable distribution of land among citizens, with enlightened and virtuous politicians.

From Mart√≠&#x27;s &#x27;Campaign Diaries&#x27;, written during the final expedition in Cuba, it seems evident that Mart√≠ would have reached the highest position in the future Republic of Arms. This was not to be; his death occurred before the Assembly of Cuba was set up. Until his last minute, Mart√≠ dedicated his life to achieve full independence for Cuba. His uncompromising belief in democracy and freedom for his fatherland is what characterized his political ideology.

===United States===
Mart√≠ demonstrated an anti-imperialist attitude from an early age, and was convinced that the United States posed a danger for Latin America. While critiquing the United States for its stereotypes of Latin Americans and preoccupation with capitalism, Mart√≠ also drew parallels with the American Revolution and the nationalist movement in Cuba. At the same time, he recognized the advantages of the civilizations of Western Europe and the United States, which were open to the reforms that Latin American countries needed in order to detach themselves from the colonial heritage of Spain. Mart√≠&#x27;s distrust of U.S. politics had developed during the 1880s, due to the intervention threats that loomed on Mexico and Guatemala, and indirectly on Cuba&#x27;s future. Over time Mart√≠ became increasingly alarmed about the United States&#x27; intentions for Cuba. The United States desperately needed new markets for its industrial products because of the economic crisis it was experiencing, and the media was talking about the purchase of Cuba from Spain. Cuba was a profitable, fertile country with an important strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico. Mart√≠ felt that the interests of Cuba&#x27;s future lay with its sister nations in Latin America, and were opposite to those of the United States.

Another trait that Mart√≠ admired was the work ethic that characterized U.S. society. On various occasions Mart√≠ conveyed his deep admiration for the immigrant-based society, &quot;whose principal aspiration he interpreted as being to construct a truly modern country, based upon hard work and progressive ideas.&quot; Mart√≠ stated that he was &quot;never surprised in any country of the world [he had] visited. Here [he] was surprised... [he] remarked that no one stood quietly on the corners, no door was shut an instant, no man was quiet. [He] stopped [him]self, [he] looked respectfully on this people, and [he] said goodbye forever to that lazy life and poetical inutility of our European countries&quot;.

Although Mart√≠ opposed US intervention in Cuba, he found American society to be so great that he believed Latin America should consider imitating the United States. Mart√≠ argued that if the US &quot;could reach such a high standard of living in so short a time, and despite, too, its lack of unifying traditions, could not the same be expected of Latin America?&quot; However, Mart√≠ believed US expansionism represented Spanish American republics&#x27; &quot;greatest danger.&quot; Mart√≠ was amazed at how education was directed towards helping the development of the nation and once again encouraged Latin American countries to follow the example set by U.S. society. At the same time, he criticized the elitist educational systems of Cuba and the rest of Latin America. Often, Mart√≠ recommended countries in Latin America to &quot;send representatives to learn more relevant techniques in the United States&quot;. Once this was done, Mart√≠ hoped that this representatives would bring a &quot;much-needed modernization to the Latin American agricultural policies&quot;.

However, not everything in the United States was to be admired by Mart√≠. When it came to politics Mart√≠ wrote that politics in the US had &quot;adopted a carnival atmosphere... especially during election time&quot;. He saw acts of corruption among candidates, such as bribing &quot;the constituents with vast quantities of beer, while impressive parades wound their way through New York&#x27;s crowded streets, past masses of billboards, all exhorting the public to vote for the different political candidates&quot;. Mart√≠ criticized and condemned the elites of the United States as they &quot;pulled the main political strings behind the scenes&quot;. According to Mart√≠, the elites &quot;deserved severe censure&quot; as they were the biggest threat to the &quot;ideals with which the United States was first conceived&quot;.

Mart√≠ started to believe that the US had abused its potential. Racism was abundant. Different races were being discriminated against; political life &quot;was both cynically regarded by the public at large and widely abused by &#x27;professional politicians&#x27;; industrial magnates and powerful labor groups faced each other menacingly&quot;. All of this convinced Mart√≠ that a large-scale social conflict was imminent in the United States.

On the positive side, Mart√≠ was astonished by the &quot;inviolable right of freedom of speech which all U.S. citizens possessed&quot;. Mart√≠ applauded the United States&#x27; Constitution which allowed freedom of speech to all its citizens, no matter what political beliefs they had. In May 1883, while attending political meetings he heard &quot;the call for revolution ‚Äì and more specifically the destruction of the capitalist system&quot;. Mart√≠ was amazed that the country maintained freedom of speech even with respect to calls that &quot;could have led to its own destruction&quot;. Mart√≠ also gave his support to the women&#x27;s suffrage movements, and was &quot;pleased that women here [took] advantage of this privilege in order to make their voices heard&quot;. According to Mart√≠, free speech was essential if any nation was to be civilized and he expressed his &quot;profound admiration for these many basic liberties and opportunities open to the vast majority of U.S. citizens&quot;.

The works of Mart√≠ contain many comparisons between the ways of life of North and Latin America. The former was seen as &quot;hardy, &#x27;soulless&#x27;, and, at times, cruel society, but one which, nevertheless, had been based upon a firm foundation of liberty and on a tradition of liberty&quot;. Although U.S. society had its flaws, they tended to be &quot;of minor importance when compared to the broad sweep of social inequality, and to the widespread abuse of power prevalent in Latin America&quot;.

Once it became apparent that the United States were actually going to purchase Cuba and intended to Americanize it, Mart√≠ &quot;spoke out loudly and bravely against such action, stating the opinion of many Cubans on the United States of America.&quot;

===Latin American identity===

Jos√© Mart√≠ as a liberator believed that the Latin American countries needed to know the reality of their own history. Mart√≠ also saw the necessity of a country having its own literature. These reflections started in Mexico from 1875 and are connected to the Mexican Reform, where prominent liberals like Ignacio Manuel Altamirano and Guillermo Prieto had situated themselves in front of a cultural renovation in Mexico, taking on the same approach as Esteban Echeverr√≠a thirty years before in Argentina. In the second &quot;Boletin&quot; that Mart√≠ published in the &quot;Revista Universal&quot; (May 11, 1875) one can already see Mart√≠&#x27;s approach, which was fundamentally Latin American. His wish to build a national or Latin American identity was nothing new or unusual in those days; however, no Latin-American intellectual of that time had approached as clearly as Mart√≠ the task of building a national identity. He insisted on the necessity of building institutions and laws that matched the natural elements of each country, and recalled the failure of the applications of French and American civil codes in the new Latin American republics. Mart√≠ believed that &quot;el hombre del sur&quot;, the man of the South, should choose an appropriate development strategy matching his character, the peculiarity of his culture and history, and the nature that determined his being.

==Writings==

Mart√≠ as a writer covered a range of genres. In addition to producing newspaper articles and keeping up an extensive correspondence (his letters are included in the collection of his complete works), he wrote a serialized novel, composed poetry, wrote essays, and published four issues of a children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;La Edad de Oro&quot;(The Golden Age, 1889). His essays and articles occupy more than fifty volumes of his complete works. His prose was extensively read and influenced the modernist generation, especially the Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o, whom Mart√≠ called &quot;my son&quot; when they met in New York in 1893.

Mart√≠ did not publish any books: only two notebooks (&quot;Cuadernos&quot;) of verses, in editions outside of the market, and a number of political tracts. The rest (an enormous amount) was left dispersed in numerous newspapers and magazines, in letters, in diaries and personal notes, in other unedited texts, in frequently improvised speeches, and some lost forever. Five years after his death, the first volume of his &quot;Obras&quot; was published. A novel appeared in this collection in 1911: &quot;Amistad funesta&quot;, which Mart√≠ had made known was published under a pseudonym in 1885. In 1913, also in this edition, his third poetic collection that he had kept unedited: &quot;Versos Libres&quot;. His &quot;Diario de Campa√±a&quot; (Campaign Diary) was published in 1941. Later still, in 1980, Nicaraguan poet Ernesto Mej√≠a S√°nchez produced a set of about thirty of Mart√≠&#x27;s articles written for the Mexican newspaper &quot;El Partido Liberal&quot; that weren&#x27;t included in any of his so-called &quot;Obras Completas&quot; editions. From 1882 to 1891, Mart√≠ collaborated in &quot;La Naci√≥n&quot;, a Buenos Aires newspaper. His texts from &quot;La Naci√≥n&quot; have been collected in &quot;Anuario del centro de Estudios Mart√≠anos&quot;.

Over the course of his journalistic career, he wrote for numerous newspapers, starting with &quot;El Diablo Cojuelo&quot; (The Limping Devil) and &quot;La Patria Libre&quot; (The Free Fatherland), both of which he helped to found in 1869 in Cuba and which established the extent of his political commitment and vision for Cuba. In Spain he wrote for &quot;La Colonia Espa√±ola&quot;,in Mexico for &quot;La Revista Universal&quot;, and in Venezuela for &quot;Revista Venezolana&quot;, which he founded. In New York he contributed to Venezuelan periodical &quot;La Opini√≥n Nacional&quot;, Buenos Aires newspaper &quot;La Naci√≥n&quot;, Mexico&#x27;s &quot;La Opinion Liberal&quot;, and &quot;The Hour&quot; from the U.S.

The first critical edition of Mart√≠&#x27;s complete works began to appear in 1983 in &quot;Jos√© Mart√≠: Obras completas. Edici√≥n cr√≠tica&quot;. The critical edition of his complete poems was published in 1985 in &quot;Jos√© Mart√≠: Poes√≠a completa. Edici√≥n critica.&quot;

Volume two of his &quot;Obras Completas&quot; includes his famous essay &#x27;Nuestra America&#x27; which &quot;comprises a variety of subjects relating to Spanish America about which Mart√≠ studied and wrote. Here it is noted that after Cuba his interest was directed mostly to Guatemala, Mexico and Venezuela. The various sections of this part are about general matters and international conferences; economic, social and political questions; literature and art; agrarian and industrial problems; immigration; education; relations with the United States and Spanish America; travel notes&quot;.

According to Mart√≠, the intention behind the publication of &quot;La edad de oro&quot; was &quot;so that American children may know how people used to live, and how they live nowadays, in the United States and in other countries; how many things are made, such as glass and iron, steam engines and suspension bridges and electric light; so that when a child sees a coloured stone he will know why the stone is coloured. ... We shall tell them about everything which is done in factories, where things happen which are stranger and more interesting than the magic in fairy stories. These things are real magic, more marvelous than any. ... We write for children because it is they who know how to love, because it is children who are the hope for the world&quot;.

Mart√≠&#x27;s &quot;Versos Sencillos&quot; was written &quot;in the town of Haines Falls, New York, where his doctor has sent [him] to regain his strength &#x27;where streams flowed and clouds gathered in upon themeselves&#x27;&quot;. The poetry encountered in this work is &quot;in many [ways] autobiographical and allows readers to see Mart√≠ the man and the patriot and to judge what was important to him at a crucial time in Cuban history&quot;.

Mart√≠&#x27;s writings reflected his own views both socially and politically. &quot;Cultivo Una Rosa Blanca&quot; is one of his poems that emphasize his views in hopes of betterment for society:

This poem is a clear description of Mart√≠&#x27;s societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he talks about how regardless of the person, whether kind or cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and racial differences. This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The kindness of one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within &quot;Cultivo Rosa Blanca&quot;, Mart√≠&#x27;s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.

After his breakthrough in Cuba literature, Jos√© Mart√≠ went on to contribute his works to newspapers, magazines, and books that reflected his political and social views. Because of his early death, Mart√≠ was unable to publish a vast collection of poetry; even so, his literary contributions have made him a renowned figure in literature, influencing many writers, and people in general, to aspire to follow in the footsteps of Mart√≠.

===Style===
Mart√≠&#x27;s style of writing is difficult to categorize. He used many aphorisms‚Äîshort, memorable lines that convey truth and/or wisdom‚Äîand long complex sentences. He is considered a major contributor to the Spanish American literary movement known as Modernismo and has been linked to Latin American consciousness of the modern age and modernity. His chronicles combined elements of literary portraiture, dramatic narration, and a dioramic scope. His poetry contained &quot;fresh and astonishing images along with deceptively simple sentiments&quot;. As an orator (for he made many speeches) he was known for his cascading structure, powerful aphorisms, and detailed descriptions. More important than his style is how he uses that style to put into service his ideas, making &quot;advanced&quot; convincing notions. Throughout his writing he made reference to historical figures and events, and used constant allusions to literature, current news and cultural matters. For this reason, he may be difficult to read and translate.

His didactic spirit encouraged him to establish a magazine for children, &quot;La Edad de Oro&quot; (1889) which contained a short essay titled &quot;Tres Heroes&quot; (three heroes), representative of his talent to adapt his expression to his audience; in this case, to make the young reader conscious of and amazed by the extraordinary bravery of the three men, Bolivar, Hidalgo, and San Mart√≠n. This is his style to teach delightfully.

===Translation===
Jos√© Mart√≠ is universally honored as a great poet, patriot and martyr of Cuban Independence, but he was also a translator of some note. Although he translated literary material for the sheer joy of it, much of the translating he did was imposed on him by economic necessity during his many years of exile in the United States. Mart√≠ learned English at an early age, and had begun to translate at thirteen. He continued translating for the rest of his life, including his time as a student in Spain, although the period of his greatest productivity was during his stay in New York from 1880 until he returned to Cuba in 1895.
In New York he was what is known today as a &quot;freelancer,&quot; as well as an &quot;in house&quot; translator. He translated several books for the publishing house of D. Appleton, and did a series of translations for newspapers. As a revolutionary activist in Cuba&#x27;s long struggle for independence he translated into English a number of articles and pamphlets supporting that movement. In addition to fluent English, Mart√≠ also spoke French, Italian, Latin and Classical Greek fluently, the latter learned so he could read the Greek classical works in the original.

There was clearly a dichotomy in Mart√≠&#x27;s feeling about the kind of work he was translating. Like many professionals, he undertook for money translation tasks which had little intellectual or emotional appeal for him. Although Mart√≠ never presented a systematic theory of translation nor did he write extensively about his approach to translation, he did jot down occasional thoughts on the subject, showcasing his awareness of the translator&#x27;s dilemma of the faithful versus the beautiful and stating that &quot;translation should be natural, so that it appears that the book were written in the language to which it has been translated&quot;.

===Modernism===
Modernists, in general, use a subjective language. Mart√≠&#x27;s stylistic creed is part of the necessity to de-codify the logic rigor and the linguistic construction and to eliminate the intellectual, abstract and systematic expression. There is the deliberate intention and awareness to expand the expressive system of the language. The style changes the form of thinking. Without falling into unilateralism, Mart√≠ values the expression because language is an impression and a feeling through the form. Modernism mostly searches for visions and realities, the expression takes in the impressions, the state of mind, without reflection and without concept. This is the law of subjectivity. We can see this in works of Mart√≠, one of the first modernists, who conceives the literary task like an invisible unity, an expressive totality, considering the style like &quot;a form of the content&quot; (forma del contenido).

The difference that Mart√≠ established between prose and poetry are conceptual. Poetry, as he believes, is a language of the permanent subjective: the intuition and the vision. The prose is an instrument and a method of spreading the ideas, and has the goal of elevating, encouraging and animating these ideas rather than having the expression of tearing up the heart, complaining and moaning. The prose is a service to his people.

Mart√≠ produces a system of specific signs &quot;an ideological code&quot; (c√≥digo ideol√≥gico). These symbols claim their moral value and construct signs of ethic conduct. Mart√≠&#x27;s modernism was a spiritual attitude that was reflected on the language. All his writing defines his moral world. One could also say that his ideological and spiritual sphere is fortified in his writing.

The difference between Mart√≠ and other modernist initiators such as Manuel Guti√©rrez N√°jera, Juli√°n del Casal, and Jos√© Asunci√≥n Silva (and the similarity between him and Manuel Gonz√°lez Prada) lies in the profound and transcendent value that he gave to literature, converting prose into an article or the work of a journalist. This hard work was important in giving literature authentic and independent value and distancing it from mere formal amusement. Manuel Guti√©rrez N√°jera, Rub√©n Dar√≠o, Miguel de Unamuno and Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥ saved the Mart√≠nian articles, which will have an endless value in the writings of the American continent.

Apart from Mart√≠nian articles, essay writing and literature starts to authorize itself as an alternative and privileged way to talk about politics. Literature starts to apply itself the only hermeneutics able to resolve the enigmas of a Latin American identity.

==Legacy==
===Symbol of Cuban independence===

Mart√≠&#x27;s dedication to the cause of Cuban independence and his passionate belief in democracy and justice has made him a hero for all Cubans, a symbol of unity, the &quot;Apostle&quot;, a great leader. His writings have created a platform for all that he went through during the duration of this period in time. His ultimate goal of building a democratic, just, and stable republic in Cuba and his obsession with the practical execution of this goal led him to become the most charismatic leader of the 1895 colonial revolution. His work haranguing the Cuban community, raising funds, resolving the disagreements of important revolutionary leaders, and creating the Cuban Revolutionary Party to organize this effort, put into motion the Cuban war of independence. His foresight into the future, shown in his warnings against American political interests for Cuba, was confirmed by the swift occupation of Cuba by the United States following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. His belief in the inseparability of Cuban and Latin American sovereignty and the expression thereof in his writings have contributed to the shape of the modern Latin American Identity. Through his beliefs for Cuban and Latin American sovereignty, Cuba revolted on former allies. This is why Cuba became an independent nation. His works are a cornerstone of Latin American and political literature and his prolific contributions to the fields of journalism, poetry, and prose are highly acclaimed.
===Influence on Cuban politics===
Mart√≠ was a Classical liberal whose major goal was the liberation of Cuba from Spain and the establishment of a democratic republican government. His writings on the concepts of Cuban nationalism fuelled the 1895 revolution, and have continued to inform conflicting visions of the Cuban nation.

Due to the great admiration of the Cuban people for Mart√≠, the communist government and Castro himself have tried to associate themselves with Mart√≠ as much as possible, endorsing his anti-imperialist positions, and downplaying his views that conflict with Cuban communist doctrine. Despite Mart√≠ never having supported communism or single party systems, Cuban leaders repeatedly cited Mart√≠ as an inspiration, and claimed that Mart√≠&#x27;s Partido Revolucionario Cubano was a &quot;forerunner of the Communist Party&quot;. A clear example of this forced association, is that following his death in 2016, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro was buried next to Mart√≠ in Santiago.

Regarded as Cuba&#x27;s &quot;martyr&quot; and &quot;apostle,&quot; several landmarks in Cuba are dedicated to Mart√≠. During Castro&#x27;s tenure, the politics and death of Mart√≠ were used to justify certain actions of the state. The Cuban government claimed that Mart√≠ had supported a single party system, creating a precedent for a communist government. However, such claims are due more to the communist administration&#x27;s desire to justify its actions by attributing them to the thinking of the national hero, than to concrete evidence. There is no proof that Mart√≠ wanted a one-party system for Cuba. On the contrary, he was an admirer of democracy and the American republican system, and throughout his life he fiercely criticized any type of dictatorial government. In addition, he also criticized Marx, and warned on several occasions about the dangers of socialism.

Mart√≠&#x27;s nuanced, often ambivalent positions on the most important issues of his day have led Marxist interpreters to see a class conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie as the main theme of his works, while others have identified a liberal-capitalist emphasis. Cubans who oppose the communist government honor Mart√≠ as a defender of freedom and democracy, and a figure of hope for the Cuban nation, and condemn Castro&#x27;s government for manipulating his works and creating a &quot;Castroite Mart√≠&quot; to justify its &quot;intolerance and abridgments of human rights&quot;. His writings thus remain a key ideological weapon in the battle over the fate of the Cuban nation.

===Memorials and tributes===

Jos√© Mart√≠ International Airport, Havana&#x27;s international airport, is named after Mart√≠. A statue of Mart√≠ was unveiled in Havana on his 123rd birth anniversary, with President Ra√∫l Castro attending the ceremony. The Jos√© Mart√≠ Memorial in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana includes a 109-m tower and is the largest monument in the world dedicated to a writer.

The National Association of Hispanic Publications, a non-profit organization to promote Hispanic publications, each year designates the Jos√© Mart√≠ Awards for excellence in Hispanic media.

On the waterfront of Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti, a city that Jos√© Mart√≠ visited three times, a power station is named after him. The home where he resided during his final visit in 1895 bears a marble plaque. Place Jos√© Mart√≠ (Jos√© Mart√≠ Square), featuring a bust of the poet, was inaugurated in 2014.

Parque Amigos de Jos√© Mart√≠ is a small park located in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa, FL. In 1956, the land was gifted to Cuba and the park was officially dedicated in 1960. The park prominently features a statue of Mart√≠ and a plaque erected in 1998. Near the park&#x27;s entrance is a plaque commemorating the site of La Casa De Pedroso, a boarding house where Mart√≠ convalesced following an attempted poisoning. About a block away is another historical marker commemorating his impromptu speech to Cuban cigar workers from the steps of the Ybor Factory Building in 1893. The parks and markers are inside the Ybor City Historic District.

The &quot;White Rose&quot; name of Germany&#x27;s Anti Nazi resistance group led by Sophie and Hans Scholl of Munich university was apparently inspired by Jose Marti&#x27;s verse &quot;Cultivo Una Rosa Blanca&quot; (Versos Sencillos). 
In Bucharest Romania a public school and the Romanian-Cuban Friendship Association from Targoviste are both named &quot;Jose Mart√≠&quot;.

In Shively, Kentucky, a bronze bust atop a marble monument pays tribute to Jos√© Mart√≠.

<text>WPIX (channel 11) is a television station in New York City, serving as the &quot;de facto&quot; flagship of The CW Television Network. Owned by Mission Broadcasting, the station is operated by CW majority owner Nexstar Media Group under a local marketing agreement (LMA). Since its inception in 1948, WPIX&#x27;s studios and offices have been located in the Daily News Building on East 42nd Street (also known as &quot;11 WPIX Plaza&quot;) in Midtown Manhattan. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located at the Empire State Building.

WPIX is also available as a regional superstation via satellite and cable in the United States and Canada. It is the largest Nexstar-operated station by population of market size.

==History==

===As an independent station (1948‚Äì1995)===
The station first signed on the air on June 15, 1948; it was the fifth television station to sign on in New York City and was the market&#x27;s second independent station. It was also the second of three stations to launch in the New York market during 1948, debuting one month after Newark, New Jersey‚Äìbased independent WATV (channel 13, now WNET) and two months before WJZ-TV (channel 7, now WABC-TV). WPIX&#x27;s call letters come from the slogan of the newspaper which founded the station, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, whose slogan was &quot;New York&#x27;s Picture Newspaper&quot;. The &quot;Daily News&quot;‚Ä≥s partial corporate parent was the Chicago-based Tribune Company, publishers of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

Until becoming owned outright by Tribune in 1991, WPIX operated separately from the company&#x27;s other television and radio outlets (including WGN-TV in Chicago, which signed-on two months before WPIX in April 1948) through the &quot;News&quot;-owned license holder, WPIX, Incorporated ‚Äì which in 1963, purchased New York radio station, WBFM (101.9 FM) and soon changed that station&#x27;s call letters to WPIX-FM. British businessman Robert Maxwell bought the &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1991. Tribune retained WPIX and WQCD; the radio station was sold to Emmis Communications in 1997 (it is now WFAN-FM). WPIX initially featured programming that was standard among independents: children&#x27;s programs, movies, syndicated reruns of network programs, public affairs programming, religious programs and sports ‚Äì specifically, the New York Yankees, whose baseball games WPIX carried from 1951 to 1998.

To generations of New York children, channel 11 was also the home of memorable personalities. In 1955, original WPIX staffer and weather forecaster Joe Bolton, donned a policeman&#x27;s uniform and became &quot;Officer Joe&quot;, hosting several programs based around &quot;Little Rascals&quot;, &quot;Three Stooges&quot;, and later &quot;Popeye&quot; shorts. Another early WPIX personality, Jack McCarthy, also hosted &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; cartoons as &quot;Captain Jack&quot; in the early 1960s, though he was also the longtime host of channel 11&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade coverage from 1949 to 1992. WPIX aired a local version of &quot;Bozo the Clown&quot; (with Bill Britten in the role) from 1959 to 1964; comic performers Chuck McCann and Allen Swift also hosted programs on WPIX during the mid-1960s before each moved to other entertainment work in Hollywood. Jazz singer Joya Sherrill hosted a weekday children&#x27;s show, &quot;Time for Joya&quot; (later known as &quot;Joya&#x27;s Fun School&quot;). Channel 11 produced the &quot;Magic Garden&quot; series, which ran on the station from 1972 to 1984. Beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through spring 1982, the station aired &quot;TV PIXX&quot;, a television video game show played during commercial breaks of afternoon programs. Kids would call into the station for the chance to control a video game via telephone in hopes of winning prizes.

Another staple of WPIX&#x27;s programming was its selection of movies; unlike many independent stations, WPIX&#x27;s library went beyond the usual offerings from major studios and low-budget B-movies, to movies produced by Samuel Goldwyn and imports from Britain. The station also became famous to many area viewers for their various holiday broadcasts of films that became traditions at the station, such as the broadcast of the 1934 movie &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot; on Thanksgiving Day. This reputation for film programming (for much of the station&#x27;s history, a movie ran at 8 p.m. every night in prime time; movies also made up much of the schedule on weekends) became so ingrained that the station frequently promoted itself as being &quot;New York&#x27;s Movie Station&quot; during the late 1980s and 1990s. Another notable programming stunt was &quot;Shocktober&quot;, where for the entire month of October, various horror and thriller films were played; this occurred for several years in the early 1990s, and became a cult favorite among area viewers.

From its early years through the 1960s, WPIX, like the other two major independents in New York, WOR-TV (channel 9, now WWOR) and WNEW-TV (channel 5, now WNYW), struggled to acquire other programming. In 1966, WPIX debuted &quot;The Yule Log&quot;, which combines Christmas music with a film loop of logs burning inside a fireplace. Airing on Christmas Eve and/or Christmas morning initially until 1989, the film was made in 1966 and was shot at Gracie Mansion, with the cooperation of then Mayor John V. Lindsay. WPIX revived the &quot;Yule Log&quot; due to viewer demand in 2001, and has proven to be just as popular. Several of Tribune&#x27;s other television stations (as well as WGN America and Antenna TV) have carried the WPIX version, complete with its audio soundtrack, on Christmas morning since the late 2000s, and is also streamed online on WPIX&#x27;s website. Since 1977, Channel 11 has aired a live broadcast of Midnight Mass from St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral every Christmas Eve.
The station&#x27;s &quot;Circle 11&quot; logo ‚Äì predating the existence of the World Trade Center (which was not completed until 1973), which it closely resembled ‚Äì was first unveiled in 1969 (an advertising billboard for WPIX with the &quot;Circle 11&quot; logo began appearing that year at Yankee Stadium). By the mid-1970s, WPIX emerged as the second highest-rated independent station in the area, behind WNEW-TV. WPIX dropped the &quot;Circle 11&quot; when it rebranded as &quot;11 Alive&quot; in September 1976, though it continued to appear during station editorials until around 1982 (the &quot;Alive&quot; slogan was popularized by such stations as Atlanta&#x27;s WXIA-TV, which itself has branded as &quot;11 Alive&quot; ever since that point, with the exception of a brief removal in 1995); the &quot;Circle 11&quot; logo returned as part of the &quot;11 Alive&quot; branding in 1984, before being restored full-time in the fall of 1986. Its relaunch featured a series of humorous promos in which a fictional station employee, &quot;Henry Tillman&quot;, was searching for a &quot;big idea&quot; for something uniquely New York in nature to serve as the perfect WPIX symbol. The running gag in these ads was the fact that Tillman was constantly surrounded by ‚Äì but never noticed ‚Äì objects resembling a giant &quot;11&quot;, most notably the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.
In 1978, WPIX was uplinked to satellite and became a superstation that was distributed to cable providers throughout the U.S. (many providers carried WPIX&#x27;s signal until the early 1990s, when most systems outside of the Northeastern United States began replacing WPIX with the superstation feed of WGN-TV, though the station continues to be distributed through Dish Network domestically (which since it halted sales of the package to new subscribers in September 2013, is available only to grandfathered subscribers of its a la carte superstation tier) and on most cable and satellite providers throughout Canada). Two years later, WPIX began operating on a 24-hour programming schedule.

During the late 1980s, WPIX fell to sixth place in the ratings among New York&#x27;s VHF stations, behind WNYW (which was now owned by Fox) and a resurgent WWOR (then owned by MCA‚ÄìUniversal). After president Leavitt Pope stepped down as general manager (though he remained as president and CEO of WPIX), Michael Eigner was transferred from Los Angeles sister station KTLA to become WPIX&#x27;s general manager in August 1989.

Over the next few years the station engineered a slow turnaround that eventually resulted in WPIX becoming the leading independent station in the market. In 1994, the station became the exclusive home of the New York City Marathon, carrying the event for the next five years. It was during the initial broadcast of that event that WPIX unveiled a stylized serifed &quot;11&quot; logo; the new numerical look eventually became the full-time logo, augmented with The WB&#x27;s logo after the station affiliated with that network in 1995.

In mid-January 1994, the station began airing the &quot;Action Pack&quot; programming block with the TV movie &quot;TekWar&quot;. WPIX earned the biggest ratings of all the stations airing the program, with an 11.7/17 rating.

===WB affiliation (1995‚Äì2006)===

On November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. Television division of Time Warner and the Tribune Company announced the formation of The WB Television Network. Due to the company&#x27;s ownership interest in the network (initially a 12.5% stake, before expanding to 22%), Tribune signed the majority of its independent stations to serve as The WB&#x27;s charter affiliates, resulting in WPIX becoming a network affiliate for the first time upon its January 11, 1995, debut.

The station was verbally branded as &quot;The WB, Channel 11&quot; (simply adding The WB name to the &quot;Channel 11&quot; branding in use since 1986), until it was simplified to &quot;The WB 11&quot; in 1997, and further to &quot;WB11&quot; in 2000. Initially, WPIX&#x27;s programming remained unchanged, as The WB had broadcast only prime time shows on Wednesday nights at its launch. As with other WB-affiliated stations during the network&#x27;s first four years, WPIX ran feature films and select first-run scripted series prior to its 10¬†p.m. newscast on nights when The WB did not offer network programming.

WB network and syndicated daytime programs (such as &quot;Maury&quot; and &quot;Jerry Springer&quot;) became more prominent on channel 11&#x27;s schedule starting in 1996 at the expense of most of its local-interest programming outside of news. By September 1999, when The WB completed its prime time expansion and the network began running its programming Sunday through Friday nights, movies were limited to Saturday evenings and weekend afternoons.

====September 11 attacks====

On September 11, 2001, the transmitter facilities of WPIX, and several other New York City area television and radio stations were destroyed when two hijacked airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center; both of the complex&#x27;s main towers collapsed due to fires caused by the impact. WPIX lead engineer Steven A. Jacobson was among those who were killed in the terrorist attack. WPIX&#x27;s satellite feed froze on the last video frame received from the WTC mast, a replay of the North Tower burning and the start of the impact of the South Tower; the image remained on-screen for much of the day until WPIX was able to set up alternate transmission facilities (the microwave relay for WPIX&#x27;s satellite feed was also located at the World Trade Center). WPIX also broadcast on W64AA in the interim. Since then, WPIX has transmitted its signal from the Empire State Building.

The station&#x27;s coverage of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack was notable in that WPIX&#x27;s helicopter was the last to land following an FAA directive that grounded all aircraft. WPIX was given special permission to continue airing aerial video from its helicopter after the collapse of the World Trade Center, though that permission wasn&#x27;t conditioned on WPIX distributing the footage as a pool camera. Footage from WPIX&#x27;s helicopter was one of many videos used by the NIST in its investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center complex.

===CW affiliation (2006‚Äìpresent)===

On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. Entertainment unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the two networks&#x27; respective programming to create a new &quot;fifth&quot; network called The CW. As part of the announcement, Tribune signed ten-year affiliation agreements with the network for 16 of its 19 WB-affiliated stations, including WPIX. Tribune chose not to exercise an ownership interest in The CW. At the time, WPIX was the largest CW affiliate that was not owned by either CBS Corporation or Time Warner, and the largest English-language network-affiliated station that was not an owned-and-operated station of its respective network.

WPIX began transitioning its on-air branding to &quot;CW 11&quot; during the summer of 2006; prior to the start of the station&#x27;s 10¬†p.m. newscast on September 17, 2006 (which aired following The WB&#x27;s final night of programming and the night prior to The CW&#x27;s official launch), shortly after airing the WB&#x27;s final sign off bumper featuring stars from the WB&#x27;s shows, the station aired a video montage of past WPIX logos, starting with a 1948 test pattern and concluding with the official unveiling of the new &quot;CW11&quot; logo.

On April 2, 2007, investor Sam Zell announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company, with intentions to take the publicly traded firm private. The deal was completed on December 20, 2007. Prior to the sale&#x27;s closure, WPIX had been the only commercial television station in New York City to have never been involved in an ownership transaction (Tribune subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2008, due to debt accrued from Zell&#x27;s leveraged buyout and costs from the company&#x27;s privatization; it emerged from bankruptcy in December 2012 under the control of its senior debt holders Oaktree Capital Management, Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co. and JPMorgan Chase). The station began gradually adopting a modernized &quot;Circle 11&quot; logo in mid-October 2008, featuring a slimmer version of the WB-era &quot;11&quot; (the CW logo is sometimes used next to the &quot;Circle 11&quot;, primarily in station promos for CW programs). The station&#x27;s branding was then changed to &quot;PIX 11&quot; on December 1, 2008 (the &quot;PIX&quot; in the call letters are pronounced phonetically, similar to the word &quot;picks&quot;).

On August 17, 2012, Cablevision removed the station from its New York area systems, part of a carriage dispute with Tribune in which WPIX&#x27;s Hartford, Philadelphia and Denver sister stations were removed from Cablevision&#x27;s systems in those markets. Cablevision accused Tribune of demanding higher carriage fees (claiming to total in the tens of millions of dollars) for use to help pay off debt, and alleged that it illegally bundled carriage agreements for WPIX and Hartford&#x27;s WTIC-TV (which was later pulled as well, but unlike co-owned WCCT, was initially unaffected due to a separate carriage agreement); the company denied the claims, stating its approach complied with FCC regulations. The stations and WGN America were restored in an agreement reached on October 26, following a plea by Connecticut State Senator Gayle Slossberg for the FCC to intervene in the dispute.

On May 23, 2016, WPIX owner Tribune Broadcasting and The CW reached a five-year affiliation agreement that renewed the network&#x27;s affiliations with twelve of Tribune&#x27;s CW-affiliated stations (including WPIX) through the 2020‚Äì21 television season; the deal came after a year-long disagreement between The CW&#x27;s managing partner CBS Corporation and Tribune concerning financial terms, specifically the amount of reverse compensation that The CW had sought from the group&#x27;s CW affiliates.

==== Sinclair acquisition attempt and subsequent transactions ====

Sinclair Broadcast Group announced plans to acquire Tribune Media for $3.9¬†billion on May 8, 2017, plus the assumption of $2.7¬†billion in Tribune debt. To meet regulatory approval, WPIX was one of several stations identified by Sinclair for divestitures to a third party; Sinclair partner licensee Cunningham Broadcasting was later revealed as the buyer for WPIX-TV with a below market-value $15¬†million purchase price. Several weeks after that divestment was announced, Sinclair withdrew the resale with intentions to retain WPIX outright. The attempted sale of WPIX‚Äîalong with Tribune stations in Dallas and Houston‚Äîto Cunningham, and in particular a planned sale of WGN-TV to an LLC controlled by a friend of Sinclair executive chairman David D. Smith, resulted in FCC chairman Ajit Pai publicly rejecting the merger. Despite Sinclair abandoning the divestments, the FCC voted to send the merger up for an evidentiary review. Tribune Media moved to terminate the merger outright on August 9, 2018, and filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the process.

Following the Sinclair deal&#x27;s collapse, Nexstar Media Group agreed to acquire Tribune Media&#x27;s assets on December 3, 2018, for $6.4¬†billion in cash and debt. WPIX-TV was then sold by Nexstar to the E. W. Scripps Company for $75¬†million as part of a series of divestitures totaling $1.32¬†billion; both transactions were completed on September 19, 2019. Under the terms of the deal, Nexstar was granted an option by Scripps to repurchase WPIX between March 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Nexstar partner licensee Mission Broadcasting exercised said option to buy WPIX on July 13, 2020‚ÄîNexstar had previously transferred to Mission said repurchase option‚Äîfor $75¬†million plus accrued interest. This coincided with Scripps&#x27;s eventual merger with Ion Media, owner of WPXN-TV. The sale to Mission was approved by the FCC on December 1 and completed on December 30.

On May 20, 2021, Nexstar announced that they renewed affiliations for The CW in 37 media markets, which includes WPIX.

On March 21, 2024, the FCC ruled Mission&#x27;s ownership of WPIX to be an illegal circumvention of its ownership limits, due to Nexstar treating the station like its own, and ordered Nexstar to either sell it to an independent third party or sell off some of its other stations to buy WPIX outright. The decision came as local marketing agreements and similar licensing deals came under increased scrutiny by the FCC. Nexstar stated its intent to dispute the ruling, claiming that it had always complied with FCC regulations.

==Programming==
===News operation===
As most stations did in the late 1940s and early 1950s, WPIX aired filmed coverage of news events. The station&#x27;s first news program, &quot;TelePIX Newsreel&quot;, was the first in New York City to consist entirely of filmed coverage. From 1948 to 1965, WPIX produced &quot;Three Star News&quot;, a 6:30¬†p.m. newscast which employed a three-anchor format‚Äîwith Kevin Kennedy reading world and national news, John Tillman reporting local stories and Joe Bolton as the weatherman. Bolton was later assigned to host children&#x27;s programming and was replaced by Gloria Okon. The program was canceled after an FCC complaint that some of Tillman&#x27;s &quot;man on the street&quot; interviews were staged with paid actors, most notable of which was a &quot;pro-Castro sympathizer&quot;, who was &quot;interviewed&quot; with a copy of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; newspaper conveniently tucked under his arm.

WPIX produced the &quot;Independent Network News&quot;, a national newscast that was syndicated to independent stations from June 1980 to June 1990. The program ‚Äì whose live feed was transmitted nationally weeknights at 9:30¬†p.m. (ET) ‚Äì featured the same on-air staff as channel 11&#x27;s newscasts and was broadcast from the same news studio, with &quot;INN&quot; logos covering the station&#x27;s own logo on various set pieces. In New York City, WPIX paired a 10 p.m. replay of the national news with a live local newscast at 10:30¬†pm, called the &quot;Action News Metropolitan Report&quot;. As part of a midday expansion of &quot;INN&quot;, starting in 1981, channel 11 also launched a newscast at 12:30¬†pm. During the decade, WPIX also produced two other programs syndicated to stations that carried the &quot;INN&quot; program: the business-oriented &quot;Wall Street Journal Report&quot;; and &quot;From the Editor&#x27;s Desk&quot;, a Sunday news discussion program hosted by Richard D. Heffner, host of the long-running public-affairs program &quot;The Open Mind&quot;.

WPIX was also noted for the many post‚Äìnews editorials that were delivered by Richard N. Hughes, vice president of news operations from 1969 to 1995. His editorials ended with the tagline &quot;What&#x27;s your opinion? We&#x27;d like to know.&quot; Periodically, he would read excerpts from viewers&#x27; letters in response to the editorials, invariably closing each excerpt by saying, &quot;And that ends that quote.&quot; In 1984, the station renamed its local and syndicated news programs as &quot;The Independent News&quot;. In 1986, the national &quot;INN&quot; newscast was renamed &quot;USA Tonight&quot; and aired at 10¬†pm, while the 7:30¬†p.m. program retained the &quot;Independent News&quot; title and the 10:30¬†p.m. local newscast was renamed &quot;New York Tonight&quot;. When &quot;INN&quot; was canceled, the 7:30¬†p.m. program ended as well, and WPIX focused its efforts on the 10¬†p.m. newscast.

Over the years, channel 11 has won many news awards and was the first independent station to win a New York area Emmy award for outstanding newscast, first earning the statuette in 1979 and again in 1983. It was a significant comeback for a news operation that was accused of falsifying news reports in the late 1960s, such as labeling stock footage as being shown &quot;via satellite&quot;, and claiming a voice report was live from Prague when it had actually been made from a pay telephone in Manhattan. As a result, Forum Communications ‚Äì led by future PBS and NBC News president Lawrence K. Grossman ‚Äì approached the Federal Communications Commission to challenge WPIX Inc.&#x27;s license to operate channel 11. WPIX and the &quot;Daily News&quot; prevailed in 1979 after years of litigation. Concurrent with the challenge to its license, WPIX began airing nine public-service programs in mid-1969, including &quot;Puerto Rican New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Black Pride&quot;, &quot;Suburban Closeup&quot;, &quot;Focus New Jersey&quot;, &quot;Everywoman&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, &quot;Jewish Dimension&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;The Green Thumb&quot;.

On June 5, 2000, WPIX launched a weekday morning newscast, the &quot;WB11 Morning News&quot; (now the &quot;PIX 11 Morning News&quot;), which has grown to challenge the established network morning programs as well as its more direct competitor, WNYW&#x27;s &quot;Good Day New York&quot;.

On April 26, 2008, WPIX became the fourth television station in New York City to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The station resumed a half-hour early evening newscast on September 14, 2009, that ran nightly at 6:30¬†pm, until it was replaced by syndicated reruns on June 27, 2010. Three months later, on September 11, the station launched a weekend evening 6 p.m. newscast (making WPIX one of the few U.S. television stations to carry an early evening newscast on weekends, without an existing weekday news program in that daypart). On September 20, 2010, WPIX expanded its weekday morning newscast to five hours, with the addition of an hour at 4¬†am.

On October 11, 2010, newly appointed news director Bill Carey instituted controversial format changes for the newscasts in an attempt to boost the station&#x27;s ratings. Carey made the newscasts flashier than they had previously been; Kaity Tong and Jim Watkins were replaced as anchors of the weeknight 10 p.m. broadcasts by Jodi Applegate, and multiple commentators and an edgy graphics and music package were introduced. The revamped newscast&#x27;s first week was not well received by most viewers or critics, with the station fielding numerous complaints through phone calls, emails and Facebook comments, as well as a scathing review in the &quot;Daily News&quot;. A Facebook page was created calling for Tong and Watkins&#x27;s return to the 10¬†pm news. WPIX&#x27;s sports department was shut down in March 2011, with sports segments being reduced to a two-minute feature presented by the station&#x27;s news anchors. In September 2011, WPIX relieved Watkins of his duties as weekend anchor, replacing him with Tong (who now solo anchors the 5 and 10 p.m. newscasts on Saturdays and Sundays). By late 2011, the station&#x27;s newscast ratings would fall to last place. Carey, who stepped down on October 3, 2012, was replaced as news director by Mark Effron in April 2013.

On September 12, 2011, WPIX restored an early evening newscast to its weeknight schedule with the debut of an hour-long 5 p.m. broadcast, which was originally aimed at women between the ages of 18 and 49. On December 19, 2012, Jodi Applegate left WPIX, to prepare for the birth of her child through a gestational surrogate. Morning anchor Tamsen Fadal was later named her replacement; the station later restored a two-anchor format with the hiring of WNBC sports anchor Scott Stanford as Fadal&#x27;s co-anchor on the 5¬†pm and 10¬†pm newscasts in September 2013. In March 2014, WPIX hired consumer reporter Arnold Diaz (who was fired by WNYW two months earlier due to the shutdown of its consumer investigative unit) to head up a new four-person investigative unit. On April 5, 2014, WPIX moved its weekend early evening newscast one hour earlier, from 6 to 5¬†pm.

On April 23, 2014, the station debuted a new graphics package during its 5 p.m. newscast (the opening sequences used in this package had previously debuted in January 2014, but were updated with the revamp); along with the change, the station brought back Non-Stop Music&#x27;s &quot;WPIX Custom News Package&quot;, which had previously been used as the theme for WPIX&#x27;s evening newscasts from 1993 until the 2010 format change. On June 9, the station reduced the morning newscast to four hours (with the 4 a.m. hour replaced with syndicated programs) to allow the station &quot;the flexibility to invest more resources into the key morning hours&quot;. On July 14, 2014, John Muller (who joined WPIX in 1999 and served as anchor of the morning newscast from its launch until he left for ABC News in 2011) returned to the station as evening co-anchor; Scott Stanford was reassigned to lead sports anchor (as part of a gradual reformation of the sports department that included the launch of the highlight program &quot;PIX11 Sports Desk&quot;).

During the July 2014 ratings period and again during the August 2014 ratings period, WPIX beat WNYW and WNBC, earning 3rd place in ratings only behind WABC and WCBS in the 5 p.m. timeslot among adults 25‚Äì54 (as well as in certain other demographics) for the first time since 2011; it was the only newscast in the market to make year-to-year gains in key demographics. WPIX&#x27;s newscasts also saw increases in the morning and at 10¬†pm in the 25‚Äì54 demographic.

On April 20, 2015, WPIX debuted a 6 p.m. newscast on weekdays with current evening anchors John Muller and Tamsen Fadal. On December 8, 2015, WPIX announced the hiring of former WWOR anchor Brenda Blackmon, and the addition of a new 6:30¬†p.m. program, to rival the network news on the other main stations. Kaity Tong and Blackmon began anchoring the broadcast on January 11, 2016. The 6:30¬†p.m. newscast was cancelled in September 2016.

On April 13, 2016, WPIX made an announcement of more anchor changes preceding May Sweeps. This includes Scott Stanford moving from evening sports anchor to morning news anchor with Sukanya Krishnan. Kori Chambers, formerly on the morning show, and weekend evenings, will co-anchor with Tamsen Fadal on the weekday 5 p.m. version and handle political coverage for the station. Andy Adler, who handled weekend sports duties, will become the primary sports anchor. In addition, Kala Rama and Craig Treadway, who anchored on the weekends, will now anchor the first portion of the morning news (5‚Äì6 a.m.).

In May 2017, WPIX once again revamped its anchor lineup. The station announced that former &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; and &quot;Early Today&quot; anchor Betty Nguyen would become part of the morning news team along with a returning Dan Mannarino, with Scott Stanford once again returned to anchoring sports for the evening broadcasts. In addition, WPIX announced that it would begin featuring traffic reports from WCBS radio&#x27;s Tom Kaminski, who reports from the radio station&#x27;s helicopter as he does every weekday; when he files his television reports the helicopter is referred to as &quot;Air 11&quot;.

Until the show&#x27;s cancellation in spring 2022, WPIX&#x27;s news studio was the home base for the daily syndicated entertainment news series &quot;Daily Mail TV&quot; from CBS Media Ventures, which WPIX carried locally. This was done to avert a costly remodeling of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; New York bureau for television operations. WPIX only contributed technical staff to the series, and &quot;Daily Mail TV&quot; was taped using removable logos which overlay WPIX&#x27;s logos on the set during &#x27;dark&#x27; time for the studio (in breaking news situations during &quot;Daily Mail TV&quot; tapings, WPIX originated coverage from its newsroom instead).

In January 2020, WPIX expanded its morning newscast to include the 9a.m. hour. On September 14, 2020, WPIX added an hour-long 10a.m. newscast, becoming New York&#x27;s only 10a.m. newscast; the newscast now runs from 4a.m. to 10a.m.

===Sports programming===
Since 1999, the station has been the over-the-air broadcast partner of the New York Mets. Prior to 1999, the Mets had spent their entire televised history (since 1962) with (W)WOR. WPIX, since 2013, has also simulcast some ESPN &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; telecasts involving the Giants or Jets by arrangement with WABC-TV, the main local rightsholder for the over-the-air simulcasts. WPIX has also carried NFL Network &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; telecasts involving the Giants or Jets (mostly prior to the NFL&#x27;s decision to simulcast most Thursday night games on CBS, NBC, or Fox).

WPIX served as the longtime over-the-air television broadcaster of New York Yankees baseball from 1951 to 1998. Mel Allen served as the primary announcer for the broadcasts, Red Barber from 1954 to 1966, Phil Rizzuto from 1957 to 1996, and Bobby Murcer from 1997 to 1998. With his &quot;Holy Cow!&quot; catchphrase, Rizzuto became popular especially through the 1970s. WPIX lost the broadcast rights for the Yankees to WNYW in 1998, more so the result of regional cable sports networks (in this case, MSG) gaining team broadcast rights, leaving broadcast stations with fewer games to air. In 2015, the Yankees returned to WPIX after a 17-year absence, having picked up YES Network&#x27;s package of over-the-air Yankees broadcasts, replacing WWOR-TV. These games co-existed with WPIX&#x27;s existing Mets broadcasts (produced by SportsNet New York). In 2022, these games left WPIX for Amazon Prime Video.

At various points, WPIX also aired Major League Baseball&#x27;s New York Giants, the New York Football Giants and New York Jets, professional wrestling from 1984 to 1991 from various companies such as Pro Wrestling USA, AWA All Star Wrestling, UWF, NWA/WCW Worldwide and Pro, GLOW and briefly WWF (now WWE) from late 1998 to early 1999, the NHL&#x27;s New York Rangers, the MISL&#x27;s New York Arrows and local college basketball. However, it was through its coverage of Yankees baseball that WPIX gained perhaps its greatest fame and identity.

In March 2017, it was announced that WPIX would air selected New York Cosmos soccer games beginning in the 2017 season.

In 2021, WPIX aired two Brooklyn Nets playoff games. The Nets&#x27; usual network, YES, was airing a Yankees game instead.

===Public affairs and special events===
WPIX specialized in public affairs and special event programming, inspired by its roots under the ownership of the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Early on, it offered the first in-depth program to look at New York City government, &quot;City Hall&quot;. WPIX children&#x27;s show personality Jack McCarthy anchored the station&#x27;s coverage of the annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade; the station later added the Columbus Day and National Puerto Rican Day Parade to its stable of events. Later on, the station produced &quot;Essence&quot;, a series inspired by &quot;Essence&quot; magazine and hosted by the magazine&#x27;s chief editor, Susan L. Taylor. The station also aired the Macy&#x27;s 4th of July Fireworks event. Along with the New York City Marathon, these events moved to WNBC (channel 4) after the station joined The WB. Since 2000, the Macy&#x27;s fireworks event has been carried nationally on NBC, while WABC-TV (locally) and ESPN2 (nationally outside the New York City area) broadcast the Marathon.

Special guest Coby Kranz was invited onto the daily news segment on his 11th birthday, because he was one of the only people to turn 11 on 11/11/11.

&quot;Editor&#x27;s Desk&quot; host Richard D. Heffner served as host of &quot;The Open Mind&quot;, which was produced by WPIX (and was concurrently aired on PBS member stations), before moving to other New York studios. Since 1992, WPIX has produced &quot;PIX News Closeup&quot; (hosted by WPIX senior correspondent Marvin Scott since its debut), a half-hour public affairs and interview program on Sunday mornings that focuses on domestic and international issues in the news, and discussions on political issues.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other New York City television stations:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WPIX ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, at 12:30¬†p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 33 to VHF channel 11. WCBS-TV took over the channel 33 allocation as it moved its digital signal from channel 56 as a result of the phaseout of channels 52‚Äì69.

On January 1, 2011, Tribune launched its new digital broadcast network, Antenna TV, which affiliated with WPIX through a new fourth digital subchannel. In May 2012, WPIX moved Antenna TV to digital subchannel 11.2, while digital channel 11.4 was removed (Estrella TV, which was carried on 11.2 at the time, is now affiliated with Port Jervis low-power station WASA-LD, which is owned by the network&#x27;s parent company Estrella Media). 11.4 returned to the air in 2018 as an affiliate of TBD. On September 1, 2021, 11.4 switched to Nexstar‚Äìowned classic network Rewind TV. On October 28, 2019, Court TV launched on 11.3, replacing This TV. On April 1, 2023, 11.3 switched to Grit.

<text>The Hirohito surrender broadcast, occasionally mistranslated as Jewel Voice Broadcast (), was a radio broadcast of surrender given by Hirohito, the emperor of Japan, on August 15, 1945.

It announced to the Japanese people that the Japanese government had accepted the Potsdam Declaration, which demanded the unconditional surrender of the Japanese military at the end of World War II. Following the Hiroshima bombing on August 6, and the Soviet declaration of war and Nagasaki bombing on August 9, the Emperor&#x27;s speech was broadcast at noon Japan Standard Time on August 15, 1945, and referred to the atomic bombs as a reason for the surrender.

The speech is the first known instance of a Japanese emperor speaking to the common people (albeit via a phonograph record). It was delivered in formal Classical Japanese, with much pronunciation unfamiliar to ordinary Japanese. The speech made no direct reference to a surrender of Japan, instead stating that the government had been instructed to accept the &quot;joint declaration&quot; (the Potsdam Declaration) of the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and the Soviet Union. This confused many listeners not familiar with the declaration about whether Japan had actually surrendered. Both the poor audio quality of the radio broadcast and the formal courtly language worsened the confusion.

== Recording ==
The speech was not broadcast directly, but replayed from a phonograph recording. On August 14, 1945, the NHK dispatched sound technicians to the Imperial Palace to record the broadcast. Microphones were set up in an office bunker under the Imperial Household Ministry, and Emperor Hirohito proceeded in between 11:25p.m. and 11:30p.m. During the first recording he spoke too softly, and upon the advice of the technicians, offered to rerecord it. On the second attempt, his voice was considered too high-pitched, with occasional characters being skipped. Nevertheless, the second version was deemed the official one, with the first serving as a backup.

== Broadcast ==

Many elements of the Imperial Japanese Army refused to accept that Hirohito was going to end the war, believing it dishonourable. As many as 1,000 officers and army soldiers raided the Imperial Palace on the evening of August 14, 1945 to destroy the recording. The rebels were confused by the layout of the palace and unable to find the recordings, which had been hidden in a pile of documents. The two phonographs were labelled &quot;original&quot; and &quot;copy&quot; and successfully smuggled out of the palace, the original in a lacquer box and the copy in a lunch bag. Major Kenji Hatanaka attempted to halt the broadcast at the NHK station, but was ordered to desist by the Eastern District Army.

On the morning of August 15, 1945, all NHK stations announced that the Emperor would address the nation at noon. Many people wore formal clothes for the occasion. At precisely noon that day, an NHK announcer instructed the nation to stand for an announcement &quot;of the highest importance.&quot; The national anthem, , was played, followed by the Emperor&#x27;s speech. Reportedly, this was the first time that common Japanese had heard the voice of any Japanese Emperor and the first radio address by the Emperor.

To ease the anticipated confusion, after the conclusion of the speech, a radio announcer clarified that the Emperor&#x27;s message had meant that Japan was surrendering. According to French journalist Robert Guillain, who then lived in Tokyo, upon the announcement&#x27;s conclusion, most Japanese retreated to their homes or places of business for several hours to quietly absorb and contemplate the significance of the announcement. A digitally remastered version of the broadcast was released in June 2015.

Though the word &quot;surrender&quot; was not explicitly stated, Emperor Sh≈çwa instructed Prime Minister Kantar≈ç Suzuki and his administration to communicate to the Allies that the &quot;Empire accepts the provisions of their joint declaration&quot;, which amounted to an acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. He justified Japan&#x27;s decision to go to war as an act of &quot;self-preservation and the stabilization of East Asia&quot; and referenced the setbacks and defeats of recent years, saying &quot;the war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan&#x27;s advantage&quot;. He mentioned the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that had occurred days earlier, calling the atomic bomb a &quot;new and most cruel bomb&quot;. The Emperor ended with a call on the Japanese people &quot;to be devoted to construction for the future&quot;.

The broadcast was translated into English and broadcast internationally by radio presenter Tadaichi Hirakawa at the same time. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recorded the broadcast, and its entire text appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

<doc id="188163" wikidata="Q939560" url="?curid=188163" title="The Rumble in the Jungle">
<text>George Foreman vs. Muhammad Ali, billed as The Rumble in the Jungle, was a heavyweight championship boxing match on October 30, 1974, at the 20th of May Stadium (now Stade Tata Rapha√´l) in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo), between undefeated and undisputed heavyweight champion George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. The event had an attendance of 60,000 people and was one of the most watched televised events at the time. Ali won by knockout in the eighth round.

It has been called &quot;arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century&quot; and was a major upset, with Ali coming in as a 41 underdog against the unbeaten, heavy-hitting Foreman. The fight is famous for Ali&#x27;s introduction of the rope-a-dope tactic.

Some sources estimate that the fight was watched by as many as one billion television viewers around the world, becoming the world&#x27;s most-watched live television broadcast at the time. This included a record estimated 50 million viewers watching the fight on pay-per-view or closed-circuit theatre TV. The fight grossed an estimated (inflation-adjusted ) in worldwide revenue. Decades later, the bout would be the subject of the Academy Award winning documentary film &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;.

==Inception==

Don King arranged the fight with music businessman Jerry Masucci, who took his record label&#x27;s showcase group, the Fania All-Stars, to play at the venue. King managed to get Ali and Foreman to sign separate contracts saying they would fight for him if he could get a $5 million purse. Such an amount of money, quite enormous for those days, was purported to prevent other top boxing promoters from attempts to arrange a Foreman vs. Ali match. However, as King did not have the money, and was not welcomed to stage an event of such a profile in the United States, he began seeking an outside country to stage and sponsor the event. Fred Weymar, an American advisor to Zaire&#x27;s dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, persuaded Mobutu that the publicity such a high-profile event would generate would help his regime, and Mobutu agreed for the fight to be held in his country. In a TV interview, King stated that Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi was involved in making the payment for the purse money for the athletes and other major expenses, although the precise process was not made clear.

King had pulled together a consortium that included Risnelia Investment from Panama; the Hemdale Film Corporation, a British company founded by film producer John Daly and the actor David Hemmings; Video Techniques Incorporated of New York; and Don King Productions. Although King is most closely associated with the fight, Hemdale and Video Techniques Inc., with whom King was a director, were the bout&#x27;s official co-promoters. The fight was broadcast on closed-circuit television in theaters in the United States and on over-the-air television throughout the world. The play-by-play commentary was done by &quot;Colonel&quot; Bob Sheridan. Color commentary was done by Jim Brown, David Frost, and Joe Frazier.

==Build-up and delay due to injury ==
In 1967, then-champion Ali was stripped of his title and suspended from boxing for years for his refusal to comply with the draft and enter the U.S. Army. In 1970, he first regained a boxing license and promptly fought comeback fights against Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena in an attempt to regain the heavyweight championship from the then-undefeated Joe Frazier. In a bout dubbed the Fight of the Century, Frazier won a unanimous decision, leaving Ali fighting other contenders for years in an attempt at a new title shot.

Meanwhile, the heavily muscled Foreman had quickly risen from a gold-medal victory at the 1968 Olympics to the top ranks of the heavyweight division. Greatly feared for his punching power, size, and sheer physical dominance, Foreman was nonetheless underestimated by Frazier and his promoters, and knocked the champion down six times in two rounds before the bout was stopped. He further solidified his hold over the heavyweight division by demolishing the only man besides Frazier at the time to defeat Ali, Ken Norton, in two rounds. At 25, the younger and stronger Foreman seemed an overwhelming favorite against the well-worn 32-year-old Ali.

Foreman and Ali spent much of the middle of 1974 training in Zaire, getting acclimated to its tropical African climate. The fight was originally set to happen on September 25 (September 24 in the United States due to the difference in time zones). However, eight days prior, Foreman was cut above his right eye by an accidental elbow thrown by his sparring partner Bill McMurray in a sparring session. Foreman&#x27;s cut required 11 stitches, and the date of the fight was pushed back five weeks to October 30.

A three-night-long music festival to hype the fight, Zaire 74, took place as scheduled, September 22‚Äì24, including performances by James Brown, Celia Cruz and the Fania All-Stars, B.B. King, Miriam Makeba, The Spinners, Bill Withers, The Crusaders, and Manu Dibango, as documented in the 2008 film &quot;Soul Power&quot;. The championship was scheduled for 4 am local time to appear on live closed-circuit television in the Eastern Time Zone of the US at 10 pm. Zack Clayton was selected as referee for the fight.

==Undercard==
The undercard was broadcast live for the American viewers from Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The original undercard, consisting of three bouts, was scheduled for September 24, it featured several Cus D&#x27;Amato fighters with notable amateur accomplishments:

*Middleweight: Dornell Wigfall of Brockton, Massachusetts, vs. Roland Cousins of New York City (scheduled for 6 rounds)
*Middleweight: Joey Hadley of Catskill, New York, vs. Cove Green of Bridgeport, Connecticut (scheduled for 4 rounds)
*Light heavyweight: Bobby Stewart of Amsterdam, New York, vs. Charley Scott of New York City (scheduled for 6 rounds)

However, it was cancelled after the fight was rescheduled due to Foreman&#x27;s cut.

The rescheduled undercard took place on October 29:

*Featherweight: Terry Rondeau of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, former New England featherweight champion, was introduced in the ring before the Osborne vs. Romano fight.
*Junior middleweight (for the New England Junior middleweight title): Paul Osborne of Lowell, Massachusetts, won by a fourth-round technical knockout over Al Romano of North Adams, Massachusetts.
*Middleweight: Joey Hadley (160 lbs) of Catskill, New York, won by a first-round technical knockout (scheduled for four) over Gene Orten (164) of Springfield, Massachusetts.
*Light heavyweight: Bobby Stewart (174 lbs) of Amsterdam, New York, won by unanimous decision (sixth) over Ken Jones (168) of Somers, Connecticut.

==Fight==
Ali was famed for his speed and technical skills, while Foreman&#x27;s raw power was his greatest strength. Defying convention, Ali began by attacking Foreman with disorienting right-hand leads. This was notable as it seemed that close-range fighting would inevitably favor Foreman and leave too great a chance that Ali would be stunned by Foreman&#x27;s powerful haymakers. Ali made use of the right-hand lead punch (striking with the right hand without setting up the left) in a further effort to disorient Foreman. However, while this aggressive tactic may have surprised Foreman and allowed Ali to punch him several times in the head, it failed to significantly hurt him. Before the end of the first round, Foreman began to catch up to Ali, landing punches of his own. Foreman had been trained to cut off the ring and prevent escape. Ali realized that he would tire if Foreman could keep making one step to Ali&#x27;s two, so he changed tactics.

Ali had told his trainer, Angelo Dundee, and his fans that he had a secret plan for Foreman. As the second round commenced, Ali began to lean on the ropes and cover up, letting Foreman punch him on the arms and body (a strategy Ali later dubbed the rope-a-dope). As a result, Foreman spent his energy throwing punches (without earning points) that either did not hit Ali or were deflected in a way that made Foreman hitting Ali&#x27;s head difficult, while sapping Foreman&#x27;s strength due to the large number of punches he threw. This loss of energy was key to Ali&#x27;s rope-a-dope tactic.

Meanwhile, Ali took every opportunity to shoot straight punches to Foreman&#x27;s face (which was soon visibly puffy). When the two fighters were locked in clinches, Ali consistently out-wrestled Foreman, using tactics such as leaning on Foreman to make Foreman support Ali&#x27;s weight, and holding down Foreman&#x27;s head by pushing on his neck. He constantly taunted Foreman in these clinches, telling him to throw more punches, and an enraged Foreman responded by doing just that.

After several rounds of this, Foreman began to tire. His face became increasingly damaged by hard, fast jabs and crosses by Ali. The effects were visible as Foreman was staggered by an Ali combination at the start of the fourth round, and again several times near the end of the fifth, after Foreman had seemed to dominate that round. Although Foreman kept throwing punches and coming forward, after the fifth round, he looked increasingly worn out. Ali continued to taunt him by saying, &quot;They told me you could punch, George!&quot; and &quot;They told me you could punch as hard as Joe Louis.&quot; According to Foreman: &quot;I thought he was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: &#x27;That all you got, George?&#x27; I realized that this ain&#x27;t what I thought it was.&quot;
As the fight drew into the eighth round, Foreman&#x27;s punching and defense became ineffective as the strain of throwing so many wild shots took its toll. Ali pounced as Foreman tried to pin Ali on the ropes, landing several right hooks over Foreman&#x27;s jab, followed by a five-punch combination, culminating in a left hook that brought Foreman&#x27;s head up into position and a hard right straight to the face that caused Foreman to stumble to the canvas. Foreman rose to one knee but referee Zack Clayton signaled the end of the fight before Foreman got to his feet. At the stoppage, Ali led on all three scorecards by 68‚Äì66, 70‚Äì67, and 69‚Äì66.

The fight showed that Ali was capable of taking a punch and highlighted his tactical genius, changing his fighting style by adopting the rope-a-dope, instead of his former style that emphasized movement to counter his opponent. The film of the Zaire fight shows Foreman striking Ali with hundreds of thunderous blows, many blocked, but many others getting through. Foreman mostly struck to the sides and kidney region, but also landed some vicious shots to the head, seemingly with no effect. 

Despite repeatedly calling Ali out, Foreman was unable to secure a rematch with the champion before Foreman abruptly decided to retire after a loss to Jimmy Young in 1977. Ali did not hurry to set up a rematch, making title defenses against unheralded opponents such as Jean Pierre Coopman and Richard Dunn. However, he repeatedly stated that his rematch with Foreman was one of the major fights he wanted to get to before retiring.

==Foreman and Ali==
Foreman and Ali became friends after the fight. Ali had trouble walking to the stage at the 1996 Oscars to be part of the group receiving the Oscar for &quot;When We Were Kings&quot; (1996), a documentary of the fight in Zaire, due to his Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome. Foreman helped him up the steps to receive the Oscar.

Over the years, Foreman revised his opinions on Ali and on The Rumble in the Jungle, on several accounts. In 2012, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported Foreman&#x27;s declaration: &quot;We fought in 1974, that was a long time ago. After 1981, we became the best of friends. By 1984, we loved each other. I am not closer to anyone else in this life than I am to Muhammad Ali.&quot; Foreman also stated: &quot;Then, in 1981, a reporter came to my ranch and asked me: &#x27;What happened in Africa, George?&#x27; I had to look him in the eye and say, &#x27;I lost. He beat me.&#x27; Before that I had nothing but revenge and hate on my mind, but from then on it was clear. I&#x27;ll never be able to win that match, so I had to let it go.&quot;

==Viewership and revenue==
The fight was broadcast live on pay-per-view on closed-circuit television, also known as theatre television, to venues across the world. The fight had a record estimated 50 million viewers on closed-circuit television worldwide, grossing an estimated $100million (inflation-adjusted $million) in revenue.

In the United States, the fight had an estimated three million closed-circuit viewers in 400 venues, with tickets sold at $20 (inflation-adjusted $), grossing $60million (inflation-adjusted $million) in the United States. The promoters and fighters received over half of the US closed-circuit revenue, generating an income of at least $30 million for the promoters and fighters; Ali and Foreman were paid a record $5 million each.

It had a large television audience in the United Kingdom, where the fight was watched by 26 million viewers on BBC One, nearly half of the UK&#x27;s 56 million population in 1974.

In total, including closed-circuit and free television, the fight was reported to have been watched by a record estimated television audience of one billion viewers worldwide, about a quarter of the world&#x27;s four billion population in 1974, as the world&#x27;s most-watched live television broadcast at the time. However, caution should be exercised here, as the only officially confirmed event with a billion viewers before 2011 was the 2008 Summer Olympics, with most such claims otherwise being highly exaggerated.

==Legacy==
The Rumble in the Jungle is one of Ali&#x27;s most famous fights, ranking alongside 1971&#x27;s Fight of the Century between the unbeaten former champion Ali and the unbeaten then-heavyweight champion Joe Frazier, and the pair&#x27;s final match, the Thrilla in Manila in 1975.

===Controversy ===
Immediately after the fight, Foreman called into question the legitimacy of the fight and its result. Foreman made several allegations against Ali, his trainer, and the referee. Foreman claimed first that Ali&#x27;s trainer, Angelo Dundee, had deliberately loosened the ropes of the ring days prior to the fight to aid in Ali&#x27;s rope-a-dope strategy, though this has never been confirmed. Foreman further insisted that his water had been drugged, and that it tasted like medicine. He went on to say that the water he was given in between rounds made him dizzy and droopy throughout the fight, a claim that was lost to time and ultimately never confirmed. Lastly, Foreman claimed that he had been given a quick count by the referee; this would ultimately be disproven as, when later timed, Foreman was on the canvas for approximately 11‚Äì12 seconds.

===Fan reactions===

When Ali arrived in Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he was greeted with adoration. In the eyes of the people of Zaire, Ali was like a representation of the struggles of their country, which only 12 years ago had gained independence after Belgian colonial rule followed by long-lasting turmoil. A chant for Ali took little time to form. They chanted &quot;Ali boma ye&quot;, translating &quot;Ali, kill him&quot;.

Foreman was unable to connect with the people of Zaire the way Ali did. When arriving in Zaire, Foreman exited the plane walking his two German Shepherds, the same dogs used by the Belgians during the colonization, as described in the film &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;.

In addition, the events surrounding the fight, such as its musical acts (B.B. King, the Fania All Stars, and James Brown, among others), added to its cultural impact. The concert portion of the event would later be featured in the documentary &quot;Soul Power&quot;.

In a 2002 UK poll conducted by Channel 4, the British public voted the fight as number seven in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.

===Film===
*&quot;Muhammad Ali: Skills, Brains and Guts&quot; (1975) This film produced by Big Fights Inc. was produced instantly after Ali beat Foreman to become once again heavyweight champion.

<doc id="188166" wikidata="Q909085" url="?curid=188166" title="Japan Standard Time">
<text>, or , is the standard time zone in Japan, 9 hours ahead of UTC (UTC+09:00). Japan does not observe daylight saving time, though its introduction has been debated on several occasions. During World War II, the time zone was often referred to as Tokyo Standard Time.

Japan Standard Time is equivalent to Korean Standard Time, Pyongyang Time (North Korea), Eastern Indonesia Standard Time, East-Timorese Standard Time, Palau Time, and Yakutsk Time (Russia).

==History==
Before the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), each local region had its own time zone in which noon was when the sun was exactly at its culmination. As modern transportation methods, such as trains, were adopted, this practice became a source of confusion. For example, there is a difference of about 5 degrees longitude between Tokyo and Osaka and because of this, a train that departed from Tokyo would arrive at Osaka 20 minutes behind the time in Tokyo. In 1886, Ordinance 51 was issued in response to this problem, which stated:

According to this, the was set 9 hours ahead of GMT (UTC had not been established yet). In the ordinance, the first clause mentions GMT, the second defines east longitude and west longitude and the third says the standard time zone would be in effect from 1888. The city of Akashi in Hy≈çgo Prefecture is located exactly on 135 degrees east longitude and subsequently became known as &quot;Toki no machi&quot; (Town of Time).

With the annexation of Taiwan in 1895, Ordinance 167 (pictured on the right) was issued to rename the previous Standard Time to and establish a new at 120¬∞ longitude as the time zone for the Japanese Miyako and Yaeyama Islands, as well as Taiwan and its Penghu Islands. While Korea came under Japanese rule in 1910, Korea Standard Time of GMT+08:30 continued to be used until 1912, when it was changed to Central Standard Time.

Western Standard Time, which was used in Taiwan and some parts of Okinawa, was abolished by Ordinance 529 in 1937 and replaced by Central Standard Time in those areas. Territories occupied by Japan during World War II, including Singapore and Malaya, adopted Japan Standard Time for the duration of their occupation, but reverted after Japan&#x27;s surrender.

Between 1948 and 1951 occupied Japan observed daylight saving time (DST) from the first Saturday in May at 24:00 to the second Saturday in September at 24:00 (with the exception of 1949, when the spring forward transition was the first Saturday in April at 24:00). More recently there have been efforts to restore daylight saving time in Japan but these have not succeeded.

In May 2013, former Tokyo governor Naoki Inose proposed permanently moving the country&#x27;s time zone ahead by 2 hours to better align global markets and make Japan&#x27;s stock market to be the first to open in the world at any given time.

==Time zones of the Japanese Empire==
The two-time-zone system was implemented in Japan between January 1896 and September 1937:

From October 1937, Central Standard Time was also used in western Okinawa and Taiwan.

==IANA time zone database==
The IANA time zone database contains one zone for Japan in the file zone.tab, named Asia/Tokyo.

==Daylight saving time in Japan==
From 1948 to 1952, Japan observed daylight saving time (DST) between May and September every year. The United States imposed this policy as part of the Allied occupation of Japan. In 1952, three weeks before the occupation ended, the Japanese government, which had been granted increased powers, abolished daylight saving time, and the Allied occupation authorities did not interfere. Since then, DST has never been officially implemented nationwide in Japan.

Starting in the late 1990s, a movement to reinstate DST in Japan gained some popularity, aiming at saving energy and increasing recreational time. The Hokkaido region is particularly in favour of this movement because daylight starts as early as 03:30 (in standard time) there in summer due to its high latitude and its location near the eastern edge of the time zone, with much of the region&#x27;s solar time actually closer to UTC+10:00. Because of this, the sun sets shortly after 19:00 in much of the eastern part of the country (in Tokyo, the latest sunset of the entire year is 19:01, from 26 June to 1 July, despite being at 35¬∞41&#x27;N latitude). Since 2000, a few local governments and commerce departments have promoted unmandated hour-earlier work schedule experiments during the summer without officially resetting clocks.

The Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy of the Cabinet Office is expected(written October 2013) to propose that the Japanese government begin studying DST in an attempt to help combat global warming. Japanese former Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe made a significant effort to introduce daylight saving time, but was ultimately unsuccessful. However, it is not clear that DST would conserve energy in Japan. A 2007 simulation estimated that introducing DST to Japan would increase energy use in Osaka residences by 0.13%, with a 0.02% saving due to lighting more than outweighed by a 0.15% increase due to cooling costs; the simulation did not examine non-residential buildings.

==Possibility of adjusting the time zone==

On May 22, 2013, the Governor of Tokyo (then) Naoki Inose proposed a two-hour advance (UTC+11) Japan Standard Time at an industry competitiveness conference. Its purpose is to enhance the influence of the Japanese financial market by starting early in the Tokyo financial market. The Japanese government has decided to consider this proposal. However, there has been no specific discussion of this proposal for more than ten years.

<text>The Shiji, also known as Records of the Grand Historian or The Grand Scribe&#x27;s Records, is a Chinese historical text that is the first of the Twenty-Four Histories of imperial China. It was written during the late 2nd and early 1st centuries¬†BC by the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian, building upon work begun by his father Sima Tan. The work covers a 2,500-year period from the age of the legendary Yellow Emperor to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han in the author&#x27;s own time, and describes the world as it was known to the Chinese of the Western Han dynasty.

The &quot;Shiji&quot; has been called a &quot;foundational text in Chinese civilization&quot;. After Confucius and Qin Shi Huang, &quot;Sima Qian was one of the creators of Imperial China, not least because by providing definitive biographies, he virtually created the two earlier figures.&quot; The &quot;Shiji&quot; set the model for all subsequent dynastic histories of China. In contrast to Western historiographical conventions, the &quot;Shiji&quot; does not treat history as &quot;a continuous, sweeping narrative&quot;, but rather breaks it up into smaller, overlapping units dealing with famous leaders, individuals, and major topics of significance.

==History==
===Title===
The original title of the work, as given by the author in the postface, is &quot;Taishigongshu&quot; (), or &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. However, the book was also known by a variety of other titles, including &quot;Taishigongji&quot; () and &quot;Taishigongzhuan&quot; () in ancient times. Eventually, &quot;Shiji&quot; (), or &quot;Historical Records&quot; became the most commonly used title in Chinese. This title was originally used to refer to any general historical text, although after the Three Kingdoms period, &quot;Shiji&quot; gradually began to be used exclusively to refer to Sima Qian&#x27;s work. In English, the title is variously translated as &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, &quot;Historical Records&quot;, &quot;The Grand Scribe&#x27;s Records&quot;, or &quot;Records of the Historian&quot;, although other titles are sometimes used.

===Textual history===
The work that became the &quot;Shiji&quot; was begun by Sima Tan, who was Grand Historian ( , also translated &quot;Grand Scribe&quot;) of the Han dynasty court during the late 2nd Sima Tan drafted plans for the ambitious work and left behind some fragments and notes that may have been incorporated into the final text. After Sima&#x27;s death in the &quot;Shiji&quot; was continued and completed by his son and successor Sima Qian, who is generally credited as the work&#x27;s author. The exact date of the &#x27;s completion is unknown. It is certain that Sima Qian completed it before his death in approximately with one copy residing in the imperial capital of Chang&#x27;an (present-day Xi&#x27;an) and the other copy probably being stored in Sima&#x27;s home.

Little is known about the &quot;Shiji&quot;‚Ä≥s early reception and circulation. Several 1st-century BC authors, such as the scholar Chu Shaosun (; 32‚Äì7¬†BC), added interpolations to it. Ten of the &quot;Shiji&quot; original 130 chapters were lost in the Eastern Han period (AD 25‚Äì220) and seem to have been reconstructed later.

The first commentaries to the &quot;Shiji&quot; date from the Northern and Southern dynasties (420589) and the early Tang dynasty (618907). Most historical editions of the &quot;Shiji&quot; included the commentaries of Pei Yin (, 5th century), Sima Zhen (early 8th century), and Zhang Shoujie (, early 8th century). The primary modern edition of the &quot;Shiji&quot; is the ten-volume Zhonghua Book Company edition published in 1959 (revised in 1982), which is based on an edition created in the early 1930s by the Chinese historian Gu Jiegang.

===Manuscripts===
Only two fragments of pre-Tang dynasty &quot;Shiji&quot; manuscripts have survived to the present, and both are held by the Ishiyama-dera temple in ≈åtsu, Japan. Portions of nine Tang dynasty manuscripts survive: three fragments discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century, and six manuscripts preserved in Japanese temples and museums such as the K≈çzan-ji temple in Kyoto and the T≈çy≈ç Bunko museum in Tokyo. Several woodblock printed editions of the &quot;Shiji&quot; survive, the earliest of which date to the Song dynasty (9601279).

==Contents==

The &quot;Shiji&quot; is around 526,500 Chinese characters in length, making it four times longer than Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; and longer than the Old Testament. Sima Qian conceived and composed his work in self-contained units, with a good deal of repetition between them. His manuscript was written on bamboo slips, with 24 to 36 characters each, and assembled into bundles of around 30 slips. Even after the manuscript was allowed to circulate or be copied, the work would have circulated as bundles of bamboo slips or small groups. Endymion Wilkinson calculates that there were probably between 466 and 700 bundles, whose total weight would have been , which would have been difficult to access and hard to transport. Later copies on silk would have been much lighter, but also expensive and rare. Until the work was transferred to paper many centuries later, circulation would have been difficult and piecemeal, which accounts for many of the errors and variations in the text.

Sima Qian organized the chapters of the &quot;Shiji&quot; into five categories, which each comprise a section of the book.

===&quot;Basic Annals&quot;===
The &quot;Basic Annals&quot; (&quot;bƒõnj√¨&quot; ) make up the first 12 chapters of the &quot;Shiji&quot;, and are largely similar to records from the ancient Chinese court chronicle tradition, such as the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;. The first five cover either periods, such as the Five Emperors, or individual dynasties, such as the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. The last seven cover individual rulers, starting with the First Emperor of Qin and progressing through the first emperors of the Han dynasty. In this section, Sima chose to also include &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of China, such as Xiang Yu and Empress Dowager L√º, while excluding rulers who never held any real power, such as Emperor Yi of Chu and Emperor Hui of Han.

===&quot;Tables&quot;===
Chapters 13 to 22 are the &quot;Tables&quot; (&quot;bi«éo&quot; ), which comprise one genealogical table and nine other chronological tables. They show reigns, important events, and royal lineages in table form, which Sima Qian stated that he did because &quot;the chronologies are difficult to follow when different genealogical lines exist at the same time.&quot; Each table except the last one begins with an introduction to the period it covers.

===&quot;Treatises&quot;===
The &quot;Treatises&quot; (&quot;sh≈´&quot; , sometimes called &quot;Monographs&quot;) is the shortest of the five &quot;Shiji&quot; sections, and contains eight chapters (23‚Äì30) on the historical evolution of ritual, music, pitch pipes, the calendar, astronomy, sacrifices, rivers and waterways, and financial administration.

===&quot;Hereditary Houses&quot;===
The &quot;Hereditary Houses&quot; (&quot;sh√¨jiƒÅ&quot; ) is the second largest of the five &quot;Shiji&quot; sections, and spans chapters 31 to 60. Within this section, the earlier chapters are very different in nature than the later chapters. Many of the earlier chapters are chronicle-like accounts of the leading states of the Zhou dynasty, such as the states of Qin and Lu, and two of the chapters go back as far as the Shang dynasty. The later chapters, which cover the Han dynasty, contain biographies.

===&quot;Ranked Biographies&quot;===
The &quot;Ranked Biographies&quot; (&quot;li√®zhu√†n&quot; , usually shortened to &quot;Biographies&quot;) is the largest of the five &quot;Shiji&quot; sections, covering chapters 61 to 130, and accounts for 42% of the entire work. The 69 &quot;Biographies&quot; chapters mostly contain biographical profiles of about 130 outstanding ancient Chinese men, ranging from the moral paragon Boyi from the end of the Shang dynasty to some of Sima Qian&#x27;s near contemporaries. About 40 of the chapters are dedicated to one particular man, but some are about two related figures, while others cover small groups of figures who shared certain roles, such as assassins, caring officials, or Confucian scholars. Unlike most modern biographies, the accounts in the &quot;Biographies&quot; give profiles using anecdotes to depict morals and character, with &quot;unforgettably lively impressions of people of many different kinds and of the age in which they lived.&quot; The &quot;Biographies&quot; have been popular throughout Chinese history, and have provided a large number of set phrases still used in modern Chinese.

==Style==
Unlike subsequent official historical texts that adopted Confucian doctrine, proclaimed the divine rights of the emperors, and degraded any failed claimant to the throne, Sima Qian&#x27;s more liberal and objective prose has been renowned and followed by poets and novelists. Most volumes of &quot;Liezhuan&quot; are vivid descriptions of events and persons. Sima Qian sought out stories from those who might have closer knowledge of certain historical events, using them as sources to balance the reliability and accuracy of historical records. For instance, the material on Jing Ke&#x27;s attempt at assassinating the King of Qin incorporates an eye-witness account by Xia Wuju (), a physician to the king of Qin who happened to be attending the diplomatic ceremony for Jing Ke, and this account was passed on to Sima Qian by those who knew Xia.

It has been observed that the diplomatic Sima Qian has a way of accentuating the positive in his treatment of rulers in the Basic Annals, but slipping negative information into other chapters, and so his work must be read as a whole to obtain full information. For example, the information that Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu of Han), in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu&#x27;s men, pushed his own children off his carriage to lighten it, is not given in the emperor&#x27;s biography, but in the biography of Xiang Yu. He is also careful to balance the negative with the positive, for example, in the biography of Empress Dowager Lu which contains startling accounts of her cruelty, he points out at the end that, despite whatever her personal life may have been, her rule brought peace and prosperity to the country.

==Source materials==
Sima&#x27;s family were hereditary historians to the Han emperor. Sima Qian&#x27;s father Sima Tan served as Grand Historian, and Sima Qian succeeded to his position. Thus he had access to the early Han dynasty archives, edicts, and records. Sima Qian was a methodical, skeptical historian who had access to ancient books, written on bamboo and wooden slips, from before the time of the Han dynasty. Many of the sources he used did not survive. He not only used archives and imperial records, but also interviewed people and traveled around China to verify information. In his first chapter, &quot;Annals of the Five Emperors&quot;, he writes,

The Grand Historian used &quot;The Annals of the Five Emperors&quot; () and the &quot;Classic of History&quot; as source materials to make genealogies from the time of the Yellow Emperor until that of the Gonghe regency (841‚Äì828 BC). Sima Qian often cites his sources. For example, in the first chapter, &quot;Annals of the Five Emperors&quot;, he writes, &quot;I have read the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; and the &quot;Guoyu&quot;.&quot; In his 13th chapter, &quot;Genealogical Table of the Three Ages&quot;, Sima Qian writes, &quot;I have read all the genealogies of the kings (&quot;dieji&quot; ) that exist since the time of the Yellow Emperor.&quot; In his 14th chapter, &quot;Yearly Chronicle of the Feudal Lords&quot;, he writes, &quot;I have read all the royal annals (&quot;chunqiu li pudie&quot; ) up until the time of King Li of Zhou.&quot; In his 15th chapter, &quot;Yearly Chronicle of the Six States&quot;, he writes, &quot;I have read the Annals of Qin (&quot;qin ji&quot; ), and they say that the Quanrong [a barbarian tribe] defeated King You of Zhou [ca 771 BC].&quot;

In the 19th chapter, he writes, &quot;I have occasion to read over the records of enfeoffment and come to the case of Wu Qian, the marquis of Bian...&quot; (The father of Marquis Bian, Wu Rui, was named prince () of Changsha for his loyalty to Gaozu.) In his chapter on the patriotic minister and poet Qu Yuan, Sima Qian writes, &quot;I have read [Qu Yuan&#x27;s works] &quot;Li Sao&quot;, &quot;Tianwen&quot; (&quot;Heaven Asking&quot;), &quot;Zhaohun&quot; (summoning the soul), and &quot;Ai Ying&quot; (Lament for Ying)&quot;. In the 62nd chapter, &quot;Biography of Guan and of Yan&quot;, he writes, &quot;I have read Guan&#x27;s &quot;Mu Min&quot; ( - &quot;Government of the People&quot;, a chapter in the &quot;Guanzi&quot;), &quot;Shan Gao&quot; (&quot;The Mountains Are High&quot;), &quot;Chengma&quot; (chariot and horses; a long section on war and economics), &quot;Qingzhong&quot; (Light and Heavy; i.e. &quot;what is important&quot;), and &quot;Jiufu&quot; (Nine Houses), as well as the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals of Yanzi&quot;.&quot; In his 64th chapter, &quot;Biography of Sima Rangju&quot;, the Grand Historian writes, &quot;I have read Sima&#x27;s Art of War.&quot; In the 121st chapter, &quot;Biographies of Scholars&quot;, he writes, &quot;I read the Imperial Decrees that encouraged education officials.&quot;
Sima Qian wrote of the problems with incomplete, fragmentary and contradictory sources. For example, he mentioned in the preface to chapter 15 that the chronicle records of the Zhou dynasty states kept in the royal archive were burnt by Qin Shi Huang because they contained criticisms and ridicule of the Qin state, and that the Qin annals were brief and incomplete. In the 13th chapter he mentioned that the chronologies and genealogies of different ancient texts &quot;disagree and contradict each other throughout&quot;. In his 18th chapter, Sima Qian writes, &quot;I have set down only what is certain, and in doubtful cases left a blank.&quot;

==Reliability and accuracy==
Scholars have questioned the historicity of legendary kings of the ancient periods given by Sima Qian. Sima Qian began the &quot;Shiji&quot; with an account of the five rulers of supreme virtue, the Five Emperors, who modern scholars, such as those from the Doubting Antiquity School, believe to be originally local deities of the peoples of ancient China. Sima Qian sifted out elements of the supernatural and fantastic which seemed to contradict their existence as actual human monarchs, and was therefore criticized for turning myths and folklore into sober history.

However, according to Joseph Needham, who wrote in 1954 on Sima Qian&#x27;s accounts of the kings of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 ‚Äì c. 1050 BC): 

While the king names in Sima Qian&#x27;s history of the Shang dynasty are supported by inscriptions on the oracle bones, there is, as yet, no archaeological corroboration of Sima Qian&#x27;s history of the Xia dynasty.

There are also discrepancies of fact such as dates between various portions of the work. This may be a result of Sima Qian&#x27;s use of different source texts.

==Transmission and supplementation by other writers==
After ca. 91 BC, the more-or-less completed manuscript was hidden in the residence of the author&#x27;s daughter, Sima Ying (), to avoid destruction under Emperor Wu and his immediate successor Emperor Zhao. The &quot;Shiji&quot; was finally disseminated during the reign of Emperor Xuan by Sima Qian&#x27;s grandson (through his daughter), Yang Yun (), after a hiatus of around twenty years.

The changes in the manuscript of the &quot;Shiji&quot; during this hiatus have always been disputed among scholars. That the text was more or less complete by ca. 91 BC is established in the Letter to Ren An (), composed in the Zhenghe () era of Emperor Wu&#x27;s reign. In this letter, Sima Qian describes his work as &quot;spanning from the time of the Yellow Emperor to the present age and consisting of ten tables, twelve basic annals, eight treatises, thirty chapters on hereditary houses, and seventy biographies, together totaling 130 chapters.&quot; These numbers are likewise given in the postface to &quot;Shiji&quot;.

After his death (presumably only a few years later), few people had the opportunity to see the whole work. However, various additions were still made to it. The historian Liu Zhiji reported the names of a total of fifteen scholars supposed to have added material to the &quot;Shiji&quot; during the period after the death of Sima Qian. Only the additions by Chu Shaosun (, c. 105 ‚Äì c. 30 BC) are clearly indicated by adding &quot;Mr Chu said,&quot; (Chu xiansheng yue, ). Already in the first century AD, Ban Biao and Ban Gu claimed that ten chapters in &quot;Shiji&quot; were lacking. A large number of chapters dealing with the first century of the Han dynasty (i.e. the 2nd century BC) correspond exactly to the relevant chapters from the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (&quot;Hanshu&quot;). It is unclear whether those chapters initially came from the &quot;Shiji&quot; or from the &quot;Hanshu&quot;. Researchers Yves Hervouet (1921‚Äì1999) and A. F. P. Hulsew√© argued that the originals of those chapters of the &quot;Shiji&quot; were lost and they were later reconstructed using the corresponding chapters from the &quot;Hanshu&quot;.

==Editions==
The earliest extant copy of the &quot;Shiji&quot;, handwritten, was made during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420‚Äì589 AD). The earliest printed edition, called &quot;Shiji jijie&quot; (, literally &quot;Scribal Records, Collected Annotations&quot;), was published during the Northern Song dynasty. Huang Shanfu&#x27;s edition, printed under the Southern Song dynasty, is the earliest collection of the &quot;Sanjiazhu&quot; commentaries on the &quot;Shiji&quot; (, literally: &quot;The Combined Annotations of the Three Experts&quot;).

In modern times, the Zhonghua Book Company in Beijing has published the book in both simplified Chinese for mass consumption and traditional Chinese for scholarly study. The 1959 (2nd ed., 1982) &quot;Sanjiazhu&quot; edition in traditional Chinese (based upon the Jinling Publishing House edition, see below) contains commentaries interspersed among the main text and is considered to be an authoritative modern edition.

The most well-known editions of the &quot;Shiji&quot; (all woodblock printed) are:

<text>David Mason (2 April 1926 ‚Äì 29 April 2011) was an English orchestral, solo and session trumpet player. He played the flugelhorn for the premiere of Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s ninth symphony and the piccolo trumpet solo on the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Penny Lane&quot;.

==Career==
Mason was born in London, and educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital and the Royal College of Music where he studied with Ernest Hall. His early playing career benefited from the timing of the Second World War: as a sixteen-year-old he was ineligible for call-up where many older players had already been recruited, and was thus able to pick up a lot of work in London before and during his time as a student at the Royal College of Music, which was itself interrupted by his own call-up into the Band of the Scots Guards. Before call-up he was the youngest member of the then National Symphony Orchestra.

After leaving the Royal College of Music, Mason became a member of the orchestra of the Royal Opera House, moving on later to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra where he eventually became principal trumpet. After seven years in that role he moved to the Philharmonia, where he remained for most of the rest of his orchestral career. He was a professor of trumpet at the Royal College of Music for thirty years and thus taught many of the trumpet players who now make up the core of the profession in the UK.

The Royal College of Music has awarded a David Mason Prize for Orchestral Trumpet Playing.

Mason was the flugelhorn soloist for the world premiere of Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 on 2 April 1958. The novelty of the flugelhorn (often seen as a jazz or brass band instrument) being used in such a significant mainstream classical work attracted much press comment at the time, perhaps to the detriment of the symphony&#x27;s overall coverage and consideration.

==Penny Lane==

On 17 January 1967 at Abbey Road Studios Mason recorded the piccolo trumpet solo which is a prominent part of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. The solo, inspired by Mason&#x27;s performance of Bach&#x27;s 2nd Brandenburg Concerto with the English Chamber Orchestra, is in a mock-Baroque style for which the piccolo trumpet is particularly suited, having a clean and clear sound which penetrates well through thicker midrange textures.

Mason recorded the solo using a piccolo trumpet in A (this uses a slightly longer leadpipe than the piccolo trumpet in B-flat, which itself is an octave higher than a standard B-flat trumpet). Although such piccolo trumpet solos became almost commonplace in some types of pop, this was innovative at the time and was among the first such uses: George Martin later wrote, &quot;The result was unique, something which had never been done in rock music before&quot;.

Mason also contributed to several other Beatles songs, including &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s All Too Much&quot;.

==Death==
Mason died of leukaemia in April 2011, at the age of 85.

<text>Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya (), is a country in East Africa. With an estimated population of more than 52.4 million as of mid-2024, Kenya is the 27th-most-populous country in the world and 7th most populous in Africa. Kenya&#x27;s capital and largest city is Nairobi, while its oldest and second-largest city, is the major port city of Mombasa, situated on Mombasa Island in the Indian Ocean and the surrounding mainland. Mombasa was the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate, which included most of what is now Kenya and southwestern Somalia, from 1889 to 1907. Other important cities include Kisumu and Nakuru. Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest, Ethiopia to the north, Somalia to the east, Uganda to the west, Tanzania to the south, and the Indian Ocean to the southeast. 

Kenya&#x27;s geography, climate and population vary widely, ranging from cold snow-capped mountaintops (Batian, Nelion and Point Lenana on Mount Kenya) with vast surrounding forests, wildlife and fertile agricultural regions to temperate climates in western and rift valley counties and further on to dry less fertile arid and semi-arid areas and absolute deserts (Chalbi Desert and Nyiri Desert). 

Kenya&#x27;s earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers, like the present-day Hadza people. According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, Cushitic speakers first settled in Kenya&#x27;s lowlands between 3,200 and 1,300 BC, a phase known as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. Nilotic-speaking pastoralists (ancestral to Kenya&#x27;s Nilotic speakers) began migrating from present-day South Sudan into Kenya around 500 BC. Bantu people settled at the coast and the interior between 250 BC and 500 AD.

European contact began in 1500 AD with the Portuguese Empire, and effective colonisation of Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of Africa. Modern-day Kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya Colony, which began in 1920. Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the Mau Mau revolution, which began in 1952, and the declaration of independence in 1963. After independence, Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The current constitution was adopted in 2010 and replaced the 1963 independence constitution.

Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic, in which elected officials represent the people and the president is the head of state and government. 
Kenya is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, COMESA, International Criminal Court, as well as other international organisations. It is also a major non-NATO ally of the United States. With a GNI of 1,840, Kenya is a lower-middle-income economy. Kenya&#x27;s economy is the second largest in eastern and central Africa, after Ethiopia, with Nairobi serving as a major regional commercial hub. Agriculture is the largest sector; tea and coffee are traditional cash crops, while fresh flowers are a fast-growing export. The service industry is also a major economic driver, particularly tourism. Kenya is a member of the East African Community trade bloc, though some international trade organisations categorise it as part of the Greater Horn of Africa. Africa is Kenya&#x27;s largest export market, followed by the European Union.

==Etymology==
The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya. The earliest recorded version of the modern name was written by German explorer Johann Ludwig Krapf in the 19th century. While travelling with a Kamba caravan led by the long-distance trader Chief Kivoi, Krapf spotted the mountain peak and asked what it was called. Kivoi told him &quot;&quot;Kƒ©-Nyaa&quot; or &quot;Kƒ©lƒ©ma- Kƒ©inyaa&quot;&quot;, probably because the pattern of black rock and white snow on its peaks reminded him of the feathers of the male ostrich. In archaic Kikuyu, the word &#x27;nyaga&#x27; or more commonly &#x27;manyaganyaga&#x27; is used to describe an extremely bright object. The Agikuyu, who inhabit the slopes of Mt. Kenya, call it Kƒ©rƒ©ma Kƒ©rƒ©nyaga (literally &#x27;the mountain with brightness&#x27;) in Kikuyu, while the Embu call it &quot;Kirinyaa&quot;. All three names have the same meaning.

Ludwig Krapf recorded the name as both &quot;Kenia&quot; and &quot;Kegnia&quot;. Some have said that this was a precise notation of the African pronunciation . An 1882 map drawn by Joseph Thompsons, a Scottish geologist and naturalist, indicated Mt. Kenya as Mt. Kenia. The mountain&#x27;s name was accepted, &quot;pars pro toto&quot;, as the name of the country. It did not come into widespread official use during the early colonial period, when the country was referred to as the East African Protectorate. The official name was changed to the Colony of Kenya in 1920.

==History==

===Human prehistory===
Hominids such as &quot;Homo habilis&quot; (1.8 to 2.5 million years ago) and &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (1.9 million to 350,000 years ago) are possible direct ancestors of modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, and lived in Kenya in the Pleistocene epoch. During excavations at Lake Turkana in 1984, palaeoanthropologist Richard Leakey, assisted by Kamoya Kimeu, discovered the Turkana Boy, a 1.6-million-year-old &quot;Homo erectus&quot; fossil. East Africa, including Kenya, is one of the earliest regions where modern humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) are believed to have lived. Evidence was found in 2018, dating to about 320,000 years ago, of the early emergence of modern behaviours, including long-distance trade networks (involving goods such as obsidian), the use of pigments, and the possible making of projectile points. The authors of three 2018 studies on the site suggest that complex and modern behaviours had already begun in Africa around the time of the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

===Neolithic===
The first inhabitants of present-day Kenya were hunter-gatherer groups, akin to the modern Khoisan speakers. These people were later largely replaced by agropastoralist Cushitic (ancestral to Kenya&#x27;s Cushitic speakers) from the Horn of Africa. During the early Holocene, the regional climate shifted from dry to wetter conditions, providing an opportunity for the development of cultural traditions such as agriculture and herding, in a more favourable environment.

Around 500 BC, Nilotic-speaking pastoralists (ancestral to Kenya&#x27;s Nilotic speakers) started migrating from present-day southern Sudan into Kenya. Nilotic groups in Kenya include the Kalenjin, Samburu, Luo, Turkana, and Maasai.

By the first millennium AD, Bantu-speaking farmers had moved into the region, initially along the coast. The Bantus originated in West Africa along the Benue River in what is now eastern Nigeria and western Cameroon. The Bantu migration brought new developments in agriculture and ironworking to the region. Bantu groups in Kenya include the Kikuyu, Luhya, Kamba, Kisii, Meru, Kuria, Aembu, Ambeere, Wadawida-Watuweta, Wapokomo, and Mijikenda, among others.

Notable prehistoric sites in the interior of Kenya include the (possibly archaeoastronomical) site Namoratunga on the west side of Lake Turkana and the walled settlement of Thimlich Ohinga in Migori County.

===Swahili trade period===

The Kenyan coast had served as host to communities of ironworkers and Bantu subsistence farmers, hunters, and fishers who supported the economy with agriculture, fishing, metal production, and trade with foreign countries. These communities formed the earliest city-states in the region, which were collectively known as Azania.

By the 1st century CE, many of the city-states such as Mombasa, Malindi, and Zanzibar began to establish trading relations with Arabs. This led to the increased economic growth of the Swahili states, the introduction of Islam, Arabic influences on the Swahili Bantu language, cultural diffusion, as well as the Swahili city-states becoming members of a larger trade network. Many historians had long believed that the city-states were established by Arab or Persian traders, but archaeological evidence has led scholars to recognise the city-states as an indigenous development which, though subjected to foreign influence due to trade, retained a Bantu cultural core.

DNA evidence has found that the Swahili people were of mixed African and Asian (particularly Persian) ancestry. The Kilwa Sultanate was a medieval sultanate centred at Kilwa, in modern-day Tanzania. At its height, its authority stretched over the entire length of the Swahili Coast, including Kenya. Since the 10th century, rulers of Kilwa would go on to build elaborate coral mosques and introduce copper coinage.

Swahili, a Bantu language with Arabic, Persian, and other Middle-Eastern and South Asian loanwords, later developed as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for trade between the different peoples. Since the turn of the 20th century, Swahili has adopted numerous loanwords and calques from English, many of them originating during English colonial rule.

===Early Portuguese presence===

The Swahili built Mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city-states, as well as commercial centres in Persia, Arabia, and even India. By the 15th century, Portuguese voyager Duarte Barbosa claimed that &quot;Mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships, both of which are bound from Sofala and others which come from Cambay and Melinde and others which sail to the island of Zanzibar.&quot;

In the 17th century, the Swahili coast was conquered and came under the direct rule of the Omani Arabs, who expanded the slave trade to meet the demands of plantations in Oman and Zanzibar. Initially, these traders came mainly from Oman, but later many came from Zanzibar (such as Tippu Tip). In addition, the Portuguese started buying slaves from the Omani and Zanzibari traders in response to the interruption of the transatlantic slave trade by British abolitionists.

Throughout the centuries, the Kenyan coast has played host to many merchants and explorers. Among the cities that line the Kenyan coast is Malindi. It has remained an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the African Great Lakes region. Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers. In 1414, the Chinese trader and explorer Zheng He, representing the Ming Dynasty, visited the East African coast on one of his last &#x27;treasure voyages&#x27;. Malindi authorities also welcomed the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.

===18th and 19th centuries===

During the 18th and 19th century C.E, the Masai people moved into central and southern Rift Valley plains of Kenya, from a region north of Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana). Although there were not many, they managed to conquer a great amount of land, in the plains where people did not put up much resistance. The Nandi peoples managed to oppose the Masai, while the Taveta peoples fled to the forests on the eastern edge of Mount Kilimanjaro, although they later were forced to leave the land due to the threat of smallpox. An outbreak of either rinderpest or pleuropneumonia greatly affected the Masai&#x27;s cattle, while an epidemic of smallpox affected the Masai themselves. After the death of the Masai Mbatian, the chief &quot;laibon&quot; (medicine man), the Masai split into warring factions. The Masai caused much strife in the areas they conquered; however, cooperation between such groups as the Luo people, Luhya people, and Gusii people is evidenced by shared vocabulary for modern implements and similar economic regimes. Although Arab traders remained in the area, trade routes were disrupted by the hostile Masai, though there was trade in ivory between these factions. The first foreigners to successfully get past the Masai were Johann Ludwig Krapf and Johannes Rebmann, two German missionaries who established a mission in Rabai, not too far from Mombasa. The pair were the first Europeans to sight Mount Kenya.

===German Protectorate (1885‚Äì1890)===
The colonial history of Kenya dates from the establishment of a German Empire protectorate over the Sultan of Zanzibar&#x27;s coastal possessions in 1885, followed by the arrival of the Imperial British East Africa Company in 1888. Imperial rivalry was prevented by the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty, Germany handed its East African coastal holdings to Britain in 1890.

===British Kenya (1888‚Äì1962)===
The transfer by Germany to Britain was followed by the building of the Uganda Railway passing through the country.

The building of the railway was resisted by some ethnic groups‚Äînotably the Nandi, led by &quot;Orkoiyot&quot; Koitalel Arap Samoei from 1890 to 1900‚Äîbut the British eventually built it. The &quot;Nandi&quot; were the first ethnic group to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway.

During the railway construction era, there was a significant influx of Indian workers, who provided the bulk of the skilled labour required for construction. They and most of their descendants later remained in Kenya and formed the core of several distinct Indian communities, such as the Ismaili Muslim and Sikh communities. While building the railway through Tsavo, a number of the Indian railway workers and local African labourers were attacked by two lions known as the Tsavo maneaters.

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the governors of British East Africa (as the protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa initially agreed on a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. But Lieutenant Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, the German military commander, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from Germany, Lettow-Vorbeck conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia) 14 days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.
To chase von Lettow, the British deployed the British Indian Army troops from India but needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior on foot. The Carrier Corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400,000 Africans, contributing to their long-term politicisation.

In 1920, the East Africa Protectorate was turned into a colony and renamed Kenya after its highest mountain.

During the early part of the 20th century, the interior central highlands were settled by British and other European farmers, who became wealthy farming coffee and tea. One depiction of this period of change from a colonist&#x27;s perspective is found in the memoir &quot;Out of Africa&quot; by Danish author Baroness Karen von Blixen-Finecke, published in 1937. By the 1930s, approximately 30,000 white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy.

The central highlands were already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu people, most of whom had no land claims in European terms and lived as itinerant farmers. To protect their interests, the settlers banned the growing of coffee and introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to make a living from the land dwindled. By the 1950s, there were 80,000 white settlers living in Kenya.

Throughout World War II, Kenya was an important source of manpower and agriculture for the United Kingdom. Kenya itself was the site of fighting between Allied forces and Italian troops in 1940‚Äì41, when Italian forces invaded. Wajir and Malindi were bombed as well.

===Mau Mau Uprising===

From October 1952 to December 1959, Kenya was in a state of emergency arising from the Mau Mau rebellion against British rule. The Mau Mau, also known as the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, were primarily Kikuyu people. During the colonial administration&#x27;s crackdown, over 11,000 freedom fighters had been killed, along with 100 British troops and 2,000 Kenyan loyalist soldiers. War crimes were committed on both sides of the conflict, including the publicised Lari massacre and the Hola massacre. The governor requested and obtained British and African troops, including the King&#x27;s African Rifles. The British began counter-insurgency operations. In May 1953, General Sir George Erskine took charge as commander-in-chief of the colony&#x27;s armed forces, with the personal backing of Winston Churchill.

The capture of Waruhiu Itote (nom de guerre &quot;General China&quot;) on 15 January 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure for the British. Operation Anvil opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege. Nairobi&#x27;s occupants were screened and suspected Mau Mau supporters moved to detention camps. More than 80,000 Kikuyu were held in detention camps without trial, often subject to brutal treatment. The Home Guard formed the core of the government&#x27;s strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces such as the British Army and King&#x27;s African Rifles.

The capture of Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 in Nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive. During this period, substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred. The most important of these was the Swynnerton Plan, which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau. This left roughly 1/3rd of Kikuyu bereft of any tenancy land arrangement and thus propertyless at the time of independence.

===Somalis of Kenya referendum, 1962===

Before Kenya got its independence, Somali ethnic people in present-day Kenya in the areas of Northern Frontier Districts petitioned Her Majesty&#x27;s Government not to be included in Kenya. The colonial government decided to hold Kenya&#x27;s first referendum in 1962 to check the willingness of Somalis in Kenya to join Somalia.

The result of the referendum showed that 86% of Somalis in Kenya wanted to join Somalia, yet the British colonial administration rejected the result and the Somalis remained in Kenya.

===Independence===
The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957.

Despite British hopes of handing power to &quot;moderate&quot; local rivals, it was the Kenya African National Union (KANU) of Jomo Kenyatta that formed a government. The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963, with independence conferred on all of Kenya. The U.K. ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya. The Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the colony, he would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would become one sovereign state. In this way, Kenya became an independent country under the Kenya Independence Act 1963 of the United Kingdom. On 12 December 1964, Kenya became a republic under the name &quot;Republic of Kenya&quot;.

Concurrently, the Kenyan army fought the Shifta War against ethnic Somali rebels inhabiting the Northern Frontier District who wanted to join their kin in the Somali Republic to the north. A ceasefire was eventually reached with the signing of the Arusha Memorandum in October 1967, but relative insecurity prevailed through 1969. To discourage further invasions, Kenya signed a defence pact with Ethiopia in 1969, which is still in effect.

===First presidency===

On 12 December 1964, the Republic of Kenya was proclaimed, and Jomo Kenyatta became Kenya&#x27;s first president. Under Kenyatta, corruption became widespread throughout the government, civil service, and business community. Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963. Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans. His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, with Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel.

Kenyatta&#x27;s mixed legacy was highlighted at the 10-year anniversary of Kenya&#x27;s independence. A December 1973 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Kenyatta&#x27;s leadership and Kenya for emerging as a model of pragmatism and conservatism. Kenya&#x27;s GDP had increased at an annual rate of 6.6%, higher than the population growth rate of more than 3%. But Amnesty International responded to the article by stating the cost of the stability in terms of human rights abuses. The opposition party started by Oginga Odinga‚ÄîKenya People&#x27;s Union (KPU)‚Äîwas banned in 1969 after the Kisumu Massacre and KPU leaders were still in detention without trial in gross violation of the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. The Kenya Students Union, Jehovah Witnesses and all opposition parties were outlawed. Kenyatta ruled until his death on 22 August 1978.

===Moi era===
After Kenyatta died, Daniel arap Moi became president. He retained the presidency, running unopposed in elections held in 1979, 1983 (snap elections), and 1988, all of which were held under the single-party constitution. The 1983 elections were held a year early, and were a direct result of a failed military coup on 2 August 1982.

The 1982 coup was masterminded by a low-ranking Air Force serviceman, Senior Private Hezekiah Ochuka, and was staged mainly by enlisted men of the Air Force. It was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff Mahamoud Mohamed, a veteran Somali military official. They included the General Service Unit (GSU)‚Äîa paramilitary wing of the police‚Äîand later the regular police.

On the heels of the Garissa Massacre of 1980, Kenyan troops committed the Wagalla massacre in 1984 against thousands of civilians in Wajir County. An official probe into the atrocities was later ordered in 2011.

The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the &quot;mlolongo&quot; (queuing) system, where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of casting a secret ballot. This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform. Several contentious clauses, including the one that allowed for only one political party, were changed in the following years.

=== Transition to multiparty democracy ===
In 1991, Kenya transitioned to a multiparty political system after 26 years of single-party rule. On 28 October 1992, Moi dissolved parliament, five months before the end of his term. As a result, preparations began for all elective seats in parliament as well as the president. The election was scheduled to take place on 7 December 1992, but delays led to its postponement to 29 December. Apart from KANU, the ruling party, other parties represented in the elections included FORD Kenya and FORD Asili. This election was marked by large-scale intimidation of opponents and harassment of election officials. It resulted in an economic crisis propagated by ethnic violence as the president was accused of rigging electoral results to retain power. This election was a turning point for Kenya as it signified the beginning of the end of Moi&#x27;s leadership and the rule of KANU. Moi retained the presidency and George Saitoti became vice president. Although it held on to power, KANU won 100 seats and lost 88 seats to the six opposition parties.

The 1992 elections marked the beginning of multiparty politics after more than 25 years of KANU rule. Following skirmishes in the aftermath of the elections, 5,000 people were killed and another 75,000 displaced from their homes. In the next five years, many political alliances were formed in preparation for the next elections. In 1994, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga died and several coalitions joined his FORD Kenya party to form a new party, United National Democratic Alliance. This party was plagued with disagreements. In 1995, Richard Leakey formed the Safina party, but it was denied registration until November 1997.

In 1996, KANU revised the constitution to allow Moi to remain president for another term. Subsequently, Moi stood for reelection and won a 5th term in 1997. His win was strongly criticised by his major opponents, Kibaki and Odinga, as fraudulent. Following this win, Moi was constitutionally barred from another presidential term. Beginning in 1998, he attempted to influence the country&#x27;s succession politics to have Uhuru Kenyatta elected in the 2002 elections.

===President Kibaki and the road to a new constitution===

Moi&#x27;s plan to be replaced by Uhuru Kenyatta failed, and Mwai Kibaki, running for the opposition coalition &quot;National Rainbow Coalition&quot; (NARC), was elected president. David Anderson (2003) reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers, and seemed to mark a turning point in Kenya&#x27;s democratic evolution.

In 2005, Kenyans rejected a plan to replace the 1963 independence constitution with a new one. As a result, the elections of 2007 took place following the procedure set by the old constitution. Kibaki was reelected in highly contested elections marred by political and ethnic violence. The main opposition leader, Raila Odinga, claimed the election was rigged and that he was the rightfully elected president. In the ensuing violence, 1,500 people were killed and another 600,000 internally displaced, making it the worst post-election violence in Kenya. To stop the death and displacement of people, Kibaki and Odinga agreed to work together, with the latter taking the position of a prime minister. This made Odinga the second prime minister of Kenya.

In July 2010, Kenya partnered with other East African countries to form the new East African Common Market within the East African Community. In 2011, Kenya began sending troops to Somalia to fight the terror group Al-Shabaab. In mid-2011, two consecutive missed rainy seasons precipitated the worst drought in East Africa in 60 years. The northwestern Turkana region was especially affected, with local schools shut down as a result. The crisis was reportedly over by early 2012 because of coordinated relief efforts. Aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery initiatives, including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds.

In August 2010, Kenyans held a referendum and passed a new constitution, which limited presidential powers and devolved the central government. Following the passage of the new constitution, Kenya became a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Kenya is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. The new constitution also states that executive powers are exercised by the executive branch of government, headed by the president, who chairs a cabinet composed of people chosen from outside parliament. Legislative power is vested exclusively in Parliament. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.

===Kenyatta presidency===

After Kibaki&#x27;s tenure ended in 2013, Kenya held its first general elections after the 2010 constitution had been passed. Uhuru Kenyatta won in a disputed election result, leading to a petition by the opposition leader, Raila Odinga. The supreme court upheld the election results and Kenyatta began his term with William Ruto as deputy president. Despite this ruling, the Supreme Court and the head of the Supreme Court were seen as powerful institutions that could check the powers of the president.

In 2017, Kenyatta won a second term in office in another disputed election. Odinga again petitioned the results in the Supreme Court, accusing the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of mismanagement of the elections and Kenyatta and his party of rigging. The Supreme Court overturned the election results in what became a landmark ruling in Africa and one of the very few in the world in which the results of a presidential elections were annulled. This ruling solidified the position of the Supreme Court as an independent body. Consequently, Kenya had a second round of elections for the presidential position, in which Kenyatta emerged the winner after Odinga refused to participate, citing irregularities.

In March 2018, a historic handshake between Kenyatta and his longtime opponent Odinga signalled a period of reconciliation followed by economic growth and increased stability. Between 2019 and 2021, Kenyatta and Odinga combined efforts to promote major changes to the Kenyan constitution, labelled the &quot;Building Bridges Initiative&quot; (BBI), saying that their efforts were to improve inclusion and overcome the country&#x27;s winner-take-all election system that often resulted in post-election violence. The BBI proposal called for broad expansion of the legislative and executive branches, including the creation of a prime minister with two deputies and an official leader of the opposition, reverting to selecting cabinet ministers from among the elected Members of Parliament, establishment of up to 70 new constituencies, and addition of up to 300 unelected members of Parliament (under an &quot;affirmative action&quot; plan).

Critics saw this as an unnecessary attempt to reward political dynasties and blunt the efforts of Deputy President Willian Ruto (Odinga&#x27;s rival for the next presidency) and bloat the government at an exceptional cost to the debt-laded country. Ultimately, in May 2021, the Kenyan High Court ruled that the BBI constitutional reform effort was unconstitutional, because it was not truly a popular initiative, but rather an effort of the government. The court sharply criticized Kenyatta for the attempt, laying out grounds for his being sued, personally, or even impeached (though the Parliament, which had passed the BBI, was unlikely to do that). The ruling was seen as a major defeat for both Kenyatta (soon to leave office), and Odinga (expected to seek the presidency), but a boon to Odinga&#x27;s future presidential-election rival, Ruto. On 20 August 2021, Kenya&#x27;s Court of Appeal again upheld the High Court Judgment of May 2021, which was appealed by the BBI Secretariat.

=== Ruto presidency ===

In August 2022, Deputy President William Ruto narrowly won the presidential election. He took 50.5% of the vote. His main rival, Raila Odinga, got 48.8% of the vote. On 13 September 2022, William Ruto was sworn in as Kenya&#x27;s fifth president. In 2024, Ruto and the Kenya Kwanza coalition faced popular protests over the Kenyan Finance Bill 2024.

==Geography==


At , Kenya is the world&#x27;s 47th-largest country (after Madagascar). It lies between latitudes 5¬∞N and 5¬∞S, and longitudes 34¬∞ and 42¬∞E. From the coast on the Indian Ocean, the low plains rise to central highlands which are bisected by the Great Rift Valley, and fertile plateaus lie on either side, around Lake Victoria and to the east.

The Kenyan Highlands are one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. The highlands are the site of the highest point in Kenya and the second highest peak on the continent: Mount Kenya, which reaches a height of and is the site of glaciers. Mount Kilimanjaro () can be seen from Kenya to the south of the Tanzanian border.

===Climate===
Kenya&#x27;s climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate inland to arid in the north and northeast parts of the country. The area receives a great deal of sunshine every month. It is usually cool at night and early in the morning inland at higher elevations.

The &quot;long rains&quot; season occurs from March/April to May/June. The &quot;short rains&quot; season occurs from October to November/December. The rainfall is sometimes heavy and often falls in the afternoons and evenings. Climate change is altering the natural pattern of the rainfall period, causing an extension of the short rains, which has begat floods, and reducing the drought cycle from every ten years to annual events, producing strong droughts such as the 2008‚Äì09 Kenya Drought.

The temperature remains high throughout these months of tropical rain. The hottest period is February and March, leading into the season of the long rains, and the coldest is in July, until mid-August.
===Wildlife===
Kenya has considerable land area devoted to wildlife habitats, including the Masai Mara, where blue wildebeest and other bovids participate in a large-scale . More than one million wildebeest and 200,000 zebras participate in the migration across the Mara River.

The &quot;Big Five&quot; game animals of Africa, that is the lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant, can be found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular. A significant population of other wild animals, reptiles, and birds can be found in the national parks and game reserves in the country. The annual animal migration occurs between June and September, with millions of animals taking part, attracting valuable foreign tourism. Two million wildebeest migrate a distance of from the Serengeti in neighbouring Tanzania to the Masai Mara in Kenya, in a constant clockwise fashion, searching for food and water supplies. This Serengeti Migration of the wildebeest is listed among the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa.

Kenya had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.2/10, ranking it 133rd globally out of 172 countries.
==Government and politics==

Kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic with a multi-party system. The president is both the head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly and the Senate. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. There has been growing concern, especially during former president Daniel arap Moi&#x27;s tenure, that the executive was increasingly meddling with the affairs of the judiciary.

Kenya has high levels of corruption according to Transparency International&#x27;s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), a metric which attempts to gauge the prevalence of public-sector corruption in various countries. In 2019, the nation placed 137th out of 180 countries in the index, with a score of 28 out of 100. But there are several rather significant developments with regard to curbing corruption from the Kenyan government, for instance the establishment of a new and independent Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).
Following general elections held in 1997, the Constitution of Kenya Review Act, designed to pave the way for more comprehensive amendments to the Kenyan constitution, was passed by the national parliament.

In December 2002, Kenya held democratic and open elections, which were judged free and fair by most international observers. The 2002 elections marked an important turning point in Kenya&#x27;s democratic evolution in that power was transferred peacefully from the Kenya African National Union (KANU), which had ruled the country since independence, to the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC), a coalition of political parties.

Under the presidency of Mwai Kibaki, the new ruling coalition promised to focus its efforts on generating economic growth, combating corruption, improving education, and rewriting its constitution. A few of these promises have been met. There is free primary education. In 2007, the government issued a statement declaring that from 2008, secondary education would be heavily subsidised, with the government footing all tuition fees.

===2013 elections and new government===
Under the new constitution and with President Kibaki prohibited by term limits from running for a third term, Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta ran for office. He won with 50.51% of the vote in March 2013.

In December 2014, President Kenyatta signed a Security Laws Amendment Bill, which supporters of the law suggested was necessary to guard against armed groups. Opposition politicians, human rights groups, and nine Western countries criticised the security bill, arguing that it infringed on democratic freedoms. The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France also collectively issued a press statement cautioning about the law&#x27;s potential impact. Through the Jubilee Coalition, the Bill was later passed on 19 December in the National Assembly under acrimonious circumstances.

===Foreign relations===
Kenya has close ties with its fellow Swahili-speaking neighbours in the African Great Lakes region. Relations with Uganda and Tanzania are generally strong, as the three nations work toward economic and social integration through common membership in the East African Community.

Relations with Somalia have historically been tense, although there has been some military co-ordination against Islamist insurgents. Kenya has good relations with the United Kingdom. Kenya is one of the most pro-American nations in Africa, and the wider world.

With International Criminal Court trial dates scheduled in 2013 for both President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto related to the 2007 election aftermath, US president Barack Obama, who is half-Kenyan, chose not to visit the country during his mid-2013 African trip. Later in the summer, Kenyatta visited China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping after a stop in Russia and not having visited the United States as president. In July 2015, Obama visited Kenya, the first American president to visit the country while in office.

The British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) is used for the training of British infantry battalions in the arid and rugged terrain of the Great Rift Valley.

===Armed forces===
The Kenya Defence Forces are the armed forces of Kenya. The Kenya Army, Kenya Navy, and Kenya Air Force compose the National Defence Forces. The current Kenya Defence Forces were established, and its composition laid out, in Article 241 of the 2010 Constitution of Kenya; the KDF is governed by the Kenya Defence Forces Act of 2012. The President of Kenya is the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces.

The armed forces are regularly deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world. Further, in the aftermath of the national elections of December 2007 and the violence that subsequently engulfed the country, a commission of inquiry, the Waki Commission, commended its readiness and adjudged it to &quot;have performed its duty well.&quot; Nevertheless, there have been serious allegations of human rights violations, most recently while conducting counter-insurgency operations in the Mt Elgon area and also in the district of Mandera central.

Kenya&#x27;s armed forces, like many government institutions in the country, have been tainted by corruption allegations. Because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of &quot;state security&quot;, the corruption has been hidden from public view, and thus less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety. This has changed recently. In what are by Kenyan standards unprecedented revelations, in 2010, credible claims of corruption were made with regard to recruitment and procurement of armoured personnel carriers. Further, the wisdom and prudence of certain decisions of procurement have been publicly questioned.

===Administrative divisions=== 

Kenya is divided into 47 semi-autonomous counties that are headed by governors. These 47 counties form the first-order divisions of Kenya.

The smallest administrative units in Kenya are called locations. Locations often coincide with electoral wards. Locations are usually named after their central villages/towns. Many larger towns consist of several locations. Each location has a chief, appointed by the state.

Constituencies are an electoral subdivision, with each county comprising a whole number of constituencies. An interim boundaries commission was formed in 2010 to review the constituencies and in its report, it recommended the creation of an additional 80 constituencies. Previous to the 2013 elections, there were 210 constituencies in Kenya.

===Human rights===

Homosexual acts are illegal in Kenya and typically punishable by up to 14 years in prison. According to a 2020 survey by the Pew Research Center, 83% of Kenyans believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society. While addressing a joint press conference together with President Barack Obama in 2015, President Kenyatta declined to assure Kenya&#x27;s commitment to gay rights, saying that &quot;the issue of gay rights is really a non-issue... But there are some things that we must admit we don&#x27;t share. Our culture, our societies don&#x27;t accept.&quot;

In November 2008, WikiLeaks brought wide international attention to &quot;The Cry of Blood&quot; report, which documents the extrajudicial killing of gangsters by the Kenyan police. In the report, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) reported these in their key finding &quot;e)&quot;, stating that the forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings appeared to be official policy sanctioned by the political leadership and the police.

==Economy==

Kenya&#x27;s macroeconomic outlook has steadily posted robust growth over the past few decades mostly from road, rail, air and water transport infrastructure projects as well as massive investments in Information and Communication Technology. The Kenyan economy is the largest in East Africa. After independence, Kenya promoted rapid economic growth through public investment, encouraged smallholder agricultural production and provided incentives for private industrial investment. Kenya is East Africa&#x27;s regional transportation and financial hub. Kenya&#x27;s financial sector is vibrant, well developed and diversified boasting the highest financial inclusion in the region and globally.

Foreign investments in Kenya remain relatively weak considering the size of its economy and its level of development. As of 2022, Kenya&#x27;s total FDI stock stood at US$10.4 billion, accounting for a mere 9.5% of the country&#x27;s GDP.

Kenya has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.555 (medium), ranked 145 out of 186 in the world. , 17.7% of Kenyans lived on less than $1.25 a day. Based on the most recent data from 2014, 37.5% of the population is affected by multidimensional poverty and an additional 35.8% vulnerable to it. In 2017, Kenya ranked 92nd in the World Bank ease of doing business rising from 113rd in 2016 (of 190 countries). The important agricultural sector is one of the least developed and largely inefficient, employing 75% of the workforce compared to less than 3% in the food secure developed countries. Kenya is usually classified as a frontier market or occasionally an emerging market, but it is not one of the least developed countries.

The economy has seen much expansion, seen by strong performance in tourism, higher education and telecommunications and decent post-drought results in agriculture, especially the vital tea sector. Kenya&#x27;s economy grew by more than 7% in 2007, and its foreign debt was greatly reduced. This changed immediately after the disputed presidential election of December 2007, following the chaos which engulfed the country.

Telecommunications and financial activity over the last decade now comprise 62% of GDP. 22% of GDP still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75% of the labour force (a characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained food security). A small portion of the population relies on food aid. Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector, accounting for 16% of GDP. The services, industry and manufacturing sectors only employ 25% of the labour force but contribute 75% of GDP.
Kenya also exports textiles worth over $400 million under AGOA.

Privatisation of state corporations like the defunct Kenya Post and Telecommunications Company, which resulted in East Africa&#x27;s most profitable company‚ÄîSafaricom, has led to their revival because of massive private investment.

, economic prospects are positive with 4‚Äì5% GDP growth expected, largely because of expansions in tourism, telecommunications, transport, construction, and a recovery in agriculture. The World Bank estimated growth of 4.3% in 2012.

In March 1996 the presidents of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda re-established the East African Community (EAC). The EAC&#x27;s objectives include harmonising tariffs and customs regimes, free movement of people and improving regional infrastructures. In March 2004, the three East African countries signed a Customs Union Agreement.

Kenya has a more developed financial services sector than its neighbours. The Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) is ranked 4th in Africa in terms of market capitalisation. The Kenyan banking system is supervised by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). As of late July 2004, the system consisted of 43 commercial banks (down from 48 in 2001) and several non-bank financial institutions including mortgage companies, four savings and loan associations and several core foreign-exchange bureaus.

The inaugural Kenya Innovation Week (KIW) was started in 2021, from December 6th to 10th, 2021, at the Kenya School of Government in Lower Kabete, Nairobi.

===Tourism===

Tourism in Kenya is the third-largest source of foreign exchange revenue following diaspora remittances and agriculture. The Kenya Tourism Board is responsible for maintaining information pertaining to tourism in Kenya.
The main tourist attractions are photo safaris through the 60 national parks and game reserves. Other attractions include the wildebeest migration at the Masaai Mara, which is considered to be the 7th wonder of the world; historical mosques, and colonial-era forts at Mombasa, Malindi, and Lamu; renowned scenery such as the white-capped Mount Kenya and the Great Rift Valley; tea plantations at Kericho; coffee plantations at Thika; a splendid view of Mount Kilimanjaro across the border into Tanzania; and the beaches along the Swahili Coast, in the Indian Ocean. Tourists, the largest number being from Germany and the United Kingdom, are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves, notably, the expansive East and Tsavo West National Park, to the southeast.

===Agriculture===

Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) after the service sector. In 2005, agriculture, including forestry and fishing, accounted for 24% of GDP, as well as for 18% of wage employment and 50% of revenue from exports. The principal cash crops are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee. Horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya&#x27;s exports. The production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations. Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid‚Äîfor example in 2004, due to one of Kenya&#x27;s intermittent droughts.

A consortium led by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties instead of maize, in particularly dry areas. Pigeon peas are very drought-resistant, so can be grown in areas with less than annual rainfall. Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20‚Äì25% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.

Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. Coconuts, pineapples, cashew nuts, cotton, sugarcane, sisal, and corn are grown in the lower-lying areas. Kenya has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security, and coupled with resulting poverty (53% of the population lives below the poverty line), a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid. Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport, and expensive air transport have isolated mostly arid and semi-arid areas, and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets. This was last seen in August and September 2011, prompting the Kenyans for Kenya initiative by the Red Cross.
Kenya&#x27;s irrigation sector is categorised into three organizational types: smallholder schemes, centrally-managed public schemes, and private/commercial irrigation schemes.

The smallholder schemes are owned, developed, and managed by individuals or groups of farmers operating as water users or self-help groups. Irrigation is carried out on individual or on group farms averaging 0.1‚Äì0.4 ha. There are about 3,000 smallholder irrigation schemes covering a total area of 47,000 ha.
The country has seven large, centrally managed irrigation schemes, namely Mwea, Bura, Hola, Perkera, West Kano, Bunyala, and Ahero, covering a total area of 18,200 ha and averaging 2,600 ha per scheme. These schemes are managed by the National Irrigation Board and account for 18% of irrigated land area in Kenya.
Large-scale private commercial farms cover 45,000 hectares, accounting for 40% of irrigated land. They utilise high technology and produce high-value crops for the export market, especially flowers and vegetables.

Kenya is the world&#x27;s 3rd largest exporter of cut flowers. Roughly half of Kenya&#x27;s 127 flower farms are concentrated around Lake Naivasha, 90 kilometres northwest of Nairobi. To speed their export, Nairobi airport has a terminal dedicated to the transport of flowers and vegetables.

===Industry and manufacturing===

Although Kenya is a low middle-income country, manufacturing accounts for 14% of the GDP, with industrial activity concentrated around the three largest urban centres of Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu, and is dominated by food-processing industries such as grain milling, beer production, sugarcane crushing, and the fabrication of consumer goods, e.g., vehicles from kits.

Kenya also has a cement production industry. Kenya has an oil refinery that processes imported crude petroleum into petroleum products, mainly for the domestic market. In addition, a substantial and expanding informal sector commonly referred to as &quot;jua kali&quot; engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods, auto parts, and farm implements.

Kenya&#x27;s inclusion among the beneficiaries of the US Government&#x27;s African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) has given a boost to manufacturing in recent years. Since AGOA took effect in 2000, Kenya&#x27;s clothing sales to the United States increased from US$44¬†million to US$270¬†million (2006). Other initiatives to strengthen manufacturing have been the new government&#x27;s favourable tax measures, including the removal of duty on capital equipment and other raw materials.

In 2023, Kenya is in the process of constructing five industrial parks that will operate tax-free, with an anticipated completion date set for 2030. Additionally, there are intentions to develop an additional 20 industrial parks in the future.

===Transport===

Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Kenya: the Cairo-Cape Town Highway and the Lagos-Mombasa Highway, so the country has an extensive road network of paved and unpaved roads. Kenya&#x27;s railway system links the nation&#x27;s ports and major cities, connecting it with neighbouring Uganda. There are 15 airports which have paved runways.

===Energy===
The largest share of Kenya&#x27;s electricity supply comes from geothermal energy, followed by hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper Tana River, as well as the Turkwel Gorge Dam in the west. A petroleum-fired plant on the coast, geothermal facilities at Olkaria (near Nairobi), and electricity imported from Uganda make up the rest of the supply. A 2,000 MW powerline from Ethiopia is nearing completion.

Kenya&#x27;s installed capacity increased from 1,142 megawatts between 2001 and 2003 to 2,341 in 2016. The state-owned Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), established in 1997 under the name of Kenya Power Company, handles the generation of electricity, while Kenya Power handles the electricity transmission and distribution system in the country. Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically, when drought reduces water flow. To become energy sufficient, Kenya has installed wind power and solar power (over 300 MW each), and aims to build a nuclear power plant by 2027.

Kenya has proven deposits of oil in Turkana. Tullow Oil estimates the country&#x27;s oil reserves to be around one billion barrels. Exploration is still continuing to determine whether there are more reserves. Kenya currently imports all crude petroleum requirements. It has no strategic reserves and relies solely on oil marketers&#x27; 21-day oil reserves required under industry regulations. Petroleum accounts for 20% to 25% of the national import bill.

===Chinese investment and trade===
Published comments on Kenya&#x27;s Capital FM website by Liu Guangyuan, China&#x27;s ambassador to Kenya, at the time of President Kenyatta&#x27;s 2013 trip to Beijing, said, &quot;Chinese investment in Kenya ... reached $474 million, representing Kenya&#x27;s largest source of foreign direct investment, and ... bilateral trade ... reached $2.84 billion&quot; in 2012. Kenyatta was &quot;[a]ccompanied by 60 Kenyan business people [and hoped to] ... gain support from China for a planned $2.5 billion railway from the southern Kenyan port of Mombasa to neighbouring Uganda, as well as a nearly $1.8 billion dam&quot;, according to a statement from the president&#x27;s office, also at the time of the trip.

Base Titanium, a subsidiary of Base resources of Australia, shipped its first major consignment of minerals to China. About 25,000 tonnes of ilmenite was flagged off the Kenyan coastal town of Kilifi. The first shipment was expected to earn Kenya about KSh.1520 billion/= in earnings. In 2014, the Chinese contracted railway project from Nairobi to Mombasa was suspended due to a dispute over compensation for land acquisition.

===Vision 2030===
In 2007, the Kenyan government unveiled Vision 2030, an economic development programme it hopes will put the country in the same league as the Asian Economic Tigers by 2030. In 2013, it launched a National Climate Change Action Plan, having acknowledged that omitting climate as a key development issue in Vision 2030 was an oversight failure. The 200-page Action Plan, developed with support from the Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network, sets out the Government of Kenya&#x27;s vision for a &#x27;low-carbon climate resilient development pathway&#x27;. At the launch in March 2013, the Secretary of the Ministry of Planning, National Development, and Vision 2030 emphasized that climate would be a central issue in the renewed Medium-Term Plan that would be launched in the coming months. This would create a direct and robust delivery framework for the Action Plan and ensure climate change is treated as an economy-wide issue. Furthermore, Kenya submitted an updated, more ambitious NDC on 24 December 2020, with a commitment to abate greenhouse gases by 32 percent by 2030 relative to the business-as-usual scenario and in line with its sustainable development agenda and national circumstances.

===Oil exploration===

Kenya has proven oil deposits in Turkana County. President Mwai Kibaki announced on 26 March 2012 that Tullow Oil, an Anglo-Irish oil exploration firm, had struck oil, but its commercial viability and subsequent production would take about three years to confirm.

Early in 2006, Chinese president Hu Jintao signed an oil exploration contract with Kenya, part of a series of deals designed to keep Africa&#x27;s natural resources flowing to China&#x27;s rapidly expanding economy.

The deal allowed for China&#x27;s state-controlled offshore oil and gas company, CNOOC, to prospect for oil in Kenya, which is just beginning to drill its first exploratory wells on the borders of Sudan and the disputed area of North Eastern Province, on the border with Somalia and in coastal waters. There are formal estimates of the possible reserves of oil discovered.

=== Action against pollution ===
In 2017, Kenya banned single-use plastic bags. According to the national environmental authority, 80% of the public has adhered to this ban. Subsequently, in 2020, the prohibition of single-use plastics was extended to protected areas, including parks and forests.

A law passed in July 2023 mandates companies to actively reduce the pollution and environmental impact caused by the products they introduce into the Kenyan market, either individually or through collective schemes. Unlike previous practices, businesses are now obligated to participate in waste collection and recycling initiatives, such the Petco initiative established by the government in 2018.

===Labour and human capital ===
Kenya has a labour force of around 24 million and a total labour force participation rate of 74%, the unemployment rate in 2022 was estimated at 5.6%

According to the World Bank&#x27;s 2019 Human Capital Index (HCI), which measured human capital of the next generation, Kenya ranked first in sub-Saharan Africa with an HCI score of 0.52. The index combined several key indicators, which are school enrolment, child survival, quality of learning, healthy growth and adult survival into a single index ranging between 0‚Äì1.

===Microfinance===
More than 20 institutions offer business loans on a large scale, specific agriculture loans, education loans, and loans for other purposes. Additionally, there are:
* emergency loans, which are more expensive in respect to interest rates, but are quickly available
* group loans for smaller groups (four to five members) and larger groups (up to 30 members)
* women&#x27;s loans, which are also available to groups of women

Out of approximately 40 million Kenyans, about 14 million are unable to receive financial service through formal loan application services, and an additional 12 million have no access to financial service institutions at all. Further, one million Kenyans are reliant on informal groups for receiving financial aid.

To mitigate this problem, the mobile banking service M-Pesa was launched in 2007 by Vodafone and Safaricom, in collaboration from the Financial Deepening Challenge Fund competition established by the UK government&#x27;s Department for International Development. M-Pesa allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money, pay for goods and services (Lipa na M-Pesa), access credit and savings, all with a mobile device, has provided access to digital transactions to millions of Kenyans in poverty situation.

==Demographics==


The census carried out by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in 2019 reported Kenya&#x27;s population as 47,564,296. The country has a young population, with 73% of residents under 30 because of rapid population growth, from 2.9 million to 40 million inhabitants over the last century.

Nairobi is home to Kibera, one of the world&#x27;s largest slums. The shantytown is believed to house between 170,000 and one million people. The UNHCR base in Dadaab in the north houses around 500,000.

===Ethnic groups===

Kenya has a diverse population that includes many of Africa&#x27;s major ethnoracial and linguistic groups. Although there is no official list of Kenyan ethnic groups, the number of ethnic categories and sub-categories recorded in the country&#x27;s census has changed significantly over time, expanding from 42 in 1969 to more than 120 in 2019. Most residents are Bantus (60%) or Nilotes (30%). Cushitic groups also form a small ethnic minority, as do Arabs, Indians, and Europeans.

According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), in 2019, the largest native ethnic groups were the Kikuyu (8,148,668), Luhya (6,823,842), Kalenjin (6,358,113), Luo (5,066,966), Kamba (4,663,910), Somali (2,780,502), Kisii (2,703,235), Mijikenda (2,488,691), Meru (1,975,869), Maasai (1,189,522), and Turkana (1,016,174). The North Eastern Province of Kenya, formerly known as NFD, is predominantly inhabited by the indigenous ethnic Somalis. Foreign-rooted populations include Arabs, Asians, and Europeans.

===Languages===
Kenya&#x27;s ethnic groups typically speak their mother tongues within their own communities. The two official languages, English and Swahili, are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations. English is widely spoken in commerce, schooling, and government. Peri-urban and rural dwellers are less multilingual, with many in rural areas speaking only their native languages.

British English is primarily used in Kenya. Additionally, a distinct local dialect, Kenyan English, is used by some communities and individuals in the country, and contains features unique to it that were derived from local Bantu languages such as Kiswahili and Kikuyu. It has been developing since colonisation and also contains certain elements of American English. Sheng is a Kiswahili-based cant spoken in some urban areas. Primarily a mixture of Swahili and English, it is an example of linguistic code-switching.

69 languages are spoken in Kenya. Most belong to two broad language families: Niger-Congo (Bantu branch) and Nilo-Saharan (Nilotic branch), spoken by the country&#x27;s Bantu and Nilotic populations respectively. The Cushitic and Arab ethnic minorities speak languages belonging to the separate Afroasiatic family, with the Indian and European residents speaking languages from the Indo-European family.

===Urban centres===

===Religion===

Most Kenyans are Christian (85.5%), with 33.4% Protestant, 20.6% Roman Catholic and 20.4% Evangelical. Roman Catholicism is the largest single Christian denomination in Kenya with about 10 million members. The Presbyterian Church of East Africa has 3 million followers in Kenya and surrounding countries. There are smaller conservative Reformed churches, the Africa Evangelical Presbyterian Church, the Independent Presbyterian Church in Kenya, and the Reformed Church of East Africa. Orthodox Christianity has 621,200 adherents. Kenya has by far the highest number of Quakers of any country in the world, with around 146,300. The only Jewish synagogue in the country is in Nairobi.

Islam is the second largest religion, comprising 11% of the population. 60% of Kenyan Muslims live in the Coastal Region, comprising 50% of the total population there, while the upper part of Kenya&#x27;s Eastern Region is home to 10% of the country&#x27;s Muslims, where they are the majority religious group. Indigenous beliefs are practised by 0.7% of the population, although many self-identifying Christians and Muslims maintain some traditional beliefs and customs. Nonreligious Kenyans are 1.6% of the population.

Some Hindus also live in Kenya. The numbers are estimated to be around 60,287, or 0.13% of the population.

===Health===

Health care is one of the low-priority sectors in Kenya and was allocated 4.8% of the national budget in 2019/2020 or just 4.59% of GDP compared to high-priority sectors such as education which was allocated more than 25%. This is below the 4.98% average in Sub-Saharan Africa and 9.83% spent globally.

According to the National and County Health Budget Analysis FY 2020/21, the breakdown of county health expenditure was 58% on Policy Planning and Administrative Support Services, 28% on Curative and Rehabilitative Health Services, 8% on Preventive and Promotive Health Services and 7% on Other Programmes.

Health care is largely funded by private individuals and their families or employers through direct payments to health care providers, to the National Health Insurance Fund or to medical insurance companies. Additional funding comes from local, international and some government social safety net schemes. Public hospitals are fee-for-service establishments that generate large amounts of county and national government revenues making them highly political and corrupt enterprises.

Private health facilities are diverse, highly dynamic, and difficult to classify, unlike public health facilities, which are easily grouped in classes that consist of community-based (level I) services, run by community health workers; dispensaries (level II facilities) run by nurses; health centres (level III facilities), run by clinical officers; sub-county hospitals (level IV facilities), which may be run by a clinical officer or a medical officer; county hospitals (level V facilities), which may be run by a medical officer or a medical practitioner; and national referral hospitals (level VI facilities), which are run by fully qualified medical practitioners.

 Nurses are by far the largest group of front-line health care providers in all sectors, followed by clinical officers, medical officers, and medical practitioners. These are absorbed and deployed into government service in accordance with the Scheme of Service for Nursing Personnel (2014), the Revised Scheme of Service for Clinical Personnel (2020) and the Revised Scheme of Service for Medical Officers and Dental Officers (2016).

Traditional healers (herbalists, witch doctors, and faith healers) are readily available, trusted, and widely consulted as practitioners of first or last choice by both rural and urban dwellers.

Despite major achievements in the health sector, Kenya still faces many challenges. The estimated life expectancy dropped in 2009 to approximately 55 years ‚Äî five years below the 1990 level. The infant mortality rate was high at approximately 44 deaths per 1,000 children in 2012. The WHO estimated in 2011 that only 42% of births were attended by a skilled health professional.

Diseases of poverty directly correlate with a country&#x27;s economic performance and wealth distribution: In 2015/16, 35.6% of Kenyans lived below the poverty line. Preventable diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea, and malnutrition are the biggest burden, major child-killers, and responsible for much morbidity; weak policies, corruption, inadequate health workers, weak management, and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame. According to 2009 estimates, HIV/AIDS prevalence is about 6.3% of the adult population. However, the 2011 UNAIDS Report suggests that the HIV epidemic may be improving in Kenya, as HIV prevalence is declining among young people (ages 15‚Äì24) and pregnant women. Kenya had an estimated 15 million cases of malaria in 2006. Tuberculosis is a major public health problem. The per capita incidence of TB in Kenya more than quadrupled between 1990 and 2015.

The 2024 Global Hunger Index gave Kenya a 25.0 score, indicating that the severity of hunger is &quot;serious&quot;.

The total fertility rate in Kenya was estimated to be 4.49 children per woman in 2012. According to a 2008‚Äì09 survey by the Kenyan government, the total fertility rate was 4.6% and the contraception usage rate among married women was 46%. Maternal mortality is high, partly because of female genital mutilation, with about 27% of women having undergone it.
This practice is however on the decline as the country becomes more modernised, and in 2011 it was banned in Kenya.
Women were economically empowered before colonialisation.
By colonial land alienation, women lost access and control of land. They became more economically dependent on men. A colonial order of gender emerged where males dominated females.
Median age at first marriage increases with increasing education.
Rape, defilement, and battering are not always seen as serious crimes.
Reports of sexual assault are not always taken seriously.

=== Youth ===
Article 260 of the Kenyan Constitution of 2010 defines youth as those between the ages of 18 and 34. According to the 2019 Population and Census results, 75 percent of the 47.6 million population is under the age of 35, making Kenya a country of the youth. Youth unemployment and underemployment in Kenya has become a problem. According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), approximately 1.7 million people lost their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which eliminated some informal jobs and caused the economy to slow. The Kenyan government has made progress in addressing the high youth unemployment by implementing various affirmative action programs and projects which include: the National Youth Service, The National Youth Enterprise Development Fund, The Women Enterprise Fund, Kazi Mtaani, Ajira Digital, Kikao Mtaani, Uwezo fund, Future Bora and Studio mashinani that empower youth, offer job opportunities and to raise one&#x27;s standard of living.

===Education===

Children attend nursery school, or kindergarten in the private sector until they are five years old. This lasts one to three years (KG1, KG2 and KG3) and is financed privately because there has been no government policy on pre-schooling until recently.

Basic formal education starts at age six and lasts 12 years, consisting of eight years in primary school and four in high school or secondary. Primary school is free in public schools and those attending can join a vocational youth/village polytechnic, or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring, carpentry, motor vehicle repair, brick-laying and masonry for about two years.

Those who complete high school can join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years, or proceed directly to university and study for four years. Graduates from the polytechnics and colleges can then join the workforce and later obtain a specialised higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training, or join the university‚Äîusually in the second or third year of their respective course. The higher diploma is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor&#x27;s degree and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities.

Public universities in Kenya are highly commercialised institutions and only a small fraction of qualified high school graduates are admitted on limited government-sponsorship into programs of their choice. Most are admitted into the social sciences, which are cheap to run, or as self-sponsored students paying the full cost of their studies. Most qualified students who miss out opt for middle-level diploma programs in public or private universities, colleges, and polytechnics.

In 2018, 18.5 percent of the Kenyan adult population was illiterate, which was the highest rate of literacy in East Africa. There are very wide regional disparities: for example, Nairobi had the highest level of literacy at 87.1 per cent, compared to North Eastern Province, the lowest, at 8.0 per cent. Preschool, which targets children from age three to five, is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade). At the end of primary education, pupils sit the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE), which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training. The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school.

Primary school is for students aged 6/7-13/14 years. For those who proceed to the secondary level, there is a national examination at the end of Form Four¬†‚Äì the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), which determines those proceeding to the universities, other professional training, or employment. Students sit examinations in eight subjects of their choosing. However, English, Kiswahili, and mathematics are compulsory subjects.

The Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS), formerly the Joint Admissions Board (JAB), is responsible for selecting students joining the public universities. Other than the public schools, there are many private schools, mainly in urban areas. Similarly, there are a number of international schools catering to various overseas educational systems.

Kenya was ranked 96th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

==Culture==

The culture of Kenya comprises multiple traditions. Kenya has no single prominent culture. It instead consists of the various cultures of the country&#x27;s different communities.

Notable populations include the Swahili on the coast, several other Bantu communities in the central and western regions, and Nilotic communities in the northwest. The Maasai culture is well known to tourism, despite constituting a relatively small part of Kenya&#x27;s population. They are renowned for their elaborate upper-body adornment and jewellery.

Additionally, Kenya has an extensive music, television, and theatre scene.

===Literature===

Ng≈©gƒ© wa Thiong&#x27;o is one of Kenya&#x27;s best-known writers. His novel &quot;Weep Not, Child depicts&quot; life in Kenya during the British occupation. The story details the effects of the Mau Mau on the lives of Kenyans. Its combination of themes‚Äîcolonialism, education, and love‚Äîhelped make it one of the best-known African novels.

M.G. Vassanji&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The In-Between World of Vikram Lall&quot; won the Giller Prize in 2003. It is the fictional memoir of a Kenyan of Indian heritage and his family as they adjust to the changing political climates in colonial and post-colonial Kenya.

Since 2003, the literary journal &quot;Kwani?&quot; has been publishing Kenyan contemporary literature. Kenya has also nurtured emerging versatile authors such as Paul Kipchumba (Kipwendui, Kibiwott) who demonstrate a pan-African outlook.

===Music===

Kenya has a diverse assortment of popular music forms, in addition to multiple types of folk music based on the variety of over 40 regional languages.

Drums are the most dominant instrument in popular Kenyan music. Drum beats are very complex and include both native rhythms and imported ones, especially the Congolese cavacha rhythm. Popular Kenyan music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts, and more recently, showy guitar solos as well. There are also a number of local hip-hop artists, including Jua Cali; Afro-pop bands such as Sauti Sol; and musicians who play local genres like Benga, such as Akothee.

Lyrics are most often in Kiswahili or English. There is also some emerging aspect of Lingala borrowed from Congolese musicians. Lyrics are also written in local languages. Urban radio generally only plays English music, though there also exist a number of vernacular radio stations.

Zilizopendwa is a genre of local urban music that was recorded in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s by musicians such as Daudi Kabaka, Fadhili William, and Sukuma Bin Ongaro, and is particularly enjoyed by older people‚Äîhaving been popularised by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Kiswahili service (formerly called Voice of Kenya or VOK).

The Isukuti is a vigorous dance performed by the Luhya sub-tribes to the beat of a traditional drum called the Isukuti during many occasions such as the birth of a child, marriage, or funeral. Other traditional dances include the Ohangla among the Luo, Nzele among the Mijikenda, Mugithi among the Kikuyu, and Taarab among the Swahili.

Additionally, Kenya has a growing Christian gospel music scene. Prominent local gospel musicians include the Kenyan Boys Choir.

Benga music has been popular since the late 1960s, especially in the area around Lake Victoria. The word &quot;benga&quot; is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music. Bass, guitar, and percussion are the usual instruments.

===Sports===

Kenya is active in several sports, among them cricket, rallying, football, rugby, field hockey, and boxing. The country is known chiefly for its dominance in middle-distance and long-distance athletics, having consistently produced Olympic and Commonwealth Games champions in various distance events, especially in 800¬†m, 1,500¬†m, 3,000¬†m steeplechase, 5,000¬†m, 10,000¬†m, and the marathon. Kenyan athletes (particularly Kalenjin), continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from Morocco and Ethiopia has reduced this supremacy. Some of Kenya&#x27;s best-known athletes include the four-time women&#x27;s Boston Marathon winner and two-time world champion Catherine Ndereba, 800m world record holder David Rudisha, former marathon world record-holder Paul Tergat, and 5000m Olympic gold medalist John Ngugi. Kenya&#x27;s most decorated athlete is three-time Olympic gold medalist and eleven-time world marathon major champion, Eliud Kipchoge.

Kenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics: six gold, four silver, and four bronze, making it Africa&#x27;s most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics. New athletes gained attention, such as Pamela Jelimo, the women&#x27;s 800m gold medalist who went on to win the IAAF Golden League jackpot, and Samuel Wanjiru, who won the men&#x27;s marathon. Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion Kipchoge Keino helped usher in Kenya&#x27;s ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion Henry Rono&#x27;s spectacular string of world record performances. Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly Bahrain and Qatar. The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with Bernard Lagat being the latest, choosing to represent the United States. Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors. Decisions by the Kenyan government to tax athletes&#x27; earnings may also be a motivating factor. Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country&#x27;s strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries.
Kenya has been a dominant force in women&#x27;s volleyball within Africa, with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade. The women&#x27;s team has competed at the Olympics and World Championships, though without any notable success. Cricket is another popular sport, also ranking as the most successful team sport. Kenya has competed in the Cricket World Cup since 1996. They upset some of the world&#x27;s best teams and reached the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament. They won the inaugural World Cricket League Division 1 hosted in Nairobi and participated in the World T20. They also participated in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. Their current captain is Rakep Patel.

Rugby is increasing in popularity, especially with the annual Safari Sevens tournament. The Kenya Sevens team ranked 9th in the IRB Sevens World Series for the 2006 season. In 2016, the team beat Fiji at the Singapore Sevens finals, making Kenya the second African nation after South Africa to win a World Series championship. Kenya was once also a regional powerhouse in football. However, its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the now defunct Kenya Football Federation, leading to a suspension by FIFA which was lifted in March 2007.

In the motor rallying arena, Kenya is home to the world-famous Safari Rally, commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world. First held in 1953, it was a part of the World Rally Championship for many years until its exclusion after the 2002 event owing to financial difficulties. Some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally, such as Bj√∂rn Waldeg√•rd, Hannu Mikkola, Tommi M√§kinen, Shekhar Mehta, Carlos Sainz, and Colin McRae. The Safari Rally returned to the world championship in 2021, after the 2003‚Äì2019 events ran as part of the African Rally Championship.

Nairobi has hosted several major continental sports events, including the FIBA Africa Championship 1993, where Kenya&#x27;s national basketball team finished in the top four, its best performance to date.

Kenya also has its own ice hockey team, the Kenya Ice Lions. The team&#x27;s home ground is the Solar Ice Rink at the Panari Sky Centre in Nairobi, which is the first and largest ice rink in all of Africa.

Kenya men&#x27;s national field hockey team was considered one of the good teams in the world during 1960s and 1970s.

Kenya was got 6th position in 1964 Summer Olympics hockey tournament and 4th in 1971 Men&#x27;s FIH Hockey World Cup.

===Cuisine===
Kenyans generally have three meals in a day‚Äîbreakfast (&quot;kiamsha kinywa&quot;), lunch (&quot;chakula cha mchana&quot;), and supper (&quot;chakula cha jioni&quot; or simply &quot;chajio&quot;). In between, they have the 10-o&#x27;clock tea (&quot;chai ya saa nne&quot;) and 4 p.m. tea (&quot;chai ya saa kumi&quot;). Breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread, chapati, mahamri, boiled sweet potatoes, or yams. Githeri is a common lunchtime dish in many households, while Ugali with vegetables, sour milk (mursik), meat, fish, or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper. Regional variations and dishes also exist.

In western Kenya, among the Luo, fish is a common dish; among the Kalenjin, who dominate much of the Rift Valley Region, mursik‚Äîsour milk‚Äîis a common drink.

In cities such as Nairobi, there are fast-food restaurants, including Steers, KFC, and Subway. There are also many fish-and-chips shops.

Cheese is becoming more popular in Kenya, with consumption increasing particularly among the middle class.

<text>Hans Enoksen (born 7 August 1956) is a Greenlandic politician who served as the third prime minister of Greenland from 2002 to 2009.

A Greenlandic monoglot, he has been a member of the Parliament of Greenland since 1995. He became Minister for Fisheries, Hunting and Settlements and chairman of the political party Siumut in 2001.

He was elected prime minister on 14 December 2002, his party winning a mere 28%, a 7% drop from the previous election in 1999, but still enough to win.

After his election he began an alliance with left wing party Inuit Ataqatigiit. The two parties began discussing how to change the agreement with Denmark and the U.S. about how much Greenland should receive in compensation for the U.S. airbase situated outside the town of Thule, in the north of the country. In the 2009 election, the IA beat him with 43% of the vote compared to Enoksen&#x27;s party&#x27;s 26%.

After the 2009 defeat, Hans Enoksen retired as leader of Siumut.

At the elections 2013 he was re-elected, but in January 2014 he was so unsatisfied with Siumut‚Ä≤s politics that he left the party and established a new political party, Partii Naleraq. The new party won 11.6% of the valid votes at the elections on 28 November 2014, and got three members elected for the Greenlandic parliament. Enoksen got 2,425 personal votes.

He was Speaker of the Inatsisartut in 2018.

<text>In the context of gene regulation: transactivation is the increased rate of gene expression triggered either by biological processes or by artificial means, through the expression of an intermediate transactivator protein. 

In the context of receptor signaling, transactivation occurs when one or more receptors activate yet another; receptor transactivation may result from the crosstalk of signaling cascades or the activation of G protein‚Äìcoupled receptor hetero-oligomer subunits, among other mechanisms.

== Natural transactivation ==
Transactivation can be triggered either by endogenous cellular or viral proteins, also called transactivators. These protein factors act in trans (&quot;i.e.&quot;, intermolecularly). HIV and HTLV are just two of the many viruses that encode transactivators to enhance viral gene expression. These transactivators can also be linked to cancer if they start interacting with, and increasing expression of, a cellular proto-oncogene. HTLV, for instance, has been associated with causing leukemia primarily through this process. Its transactivator, &quot;Tax&quot;&quot;,&quot; can interact with p40, inducing overexpression of interleukin 2, interleukin receptors, GM-CSF and the transcription factor c-Fos. HTLV infects T-cells and via the increased expression of these stimulatory cytokines and transcription factors, leads to uncontrolled proliferation of T-cells and hence lymphoma.

== Artificial transactivation ==
Artificial transactivation of a gene is achieved by inserting it into the genome at the appropriate area as transactivator gene adjoined to special promoter regions of DNA. The transactivator gene expresses a transcription factor that binds to specific promoter region of DNA. By binding to the promoter region of a gene, the transcription factor causes that gene to be expressed. The expression of one transactivator gene can activate multiple genes, as long as they have the same, specific promoter region attached. Because the expression of the transactivator gene can be controlled, transactivation can be used to turn genes on and off. If this specific promoter region is also attached to a reporter gene, we can measure when the transactivator is being expressed.

<text>West Warwick is a town in Kent County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 31,012 at the 2020 census.

West Warwick was incorporated in 1913, making it the youngest town in the state. Prior to 1913, the town, situated on the western bank of the Pawtuxet River, was the population and industrial center of the larger town of Warwick. The town split because local Democratic politicians wanted to consolidate their power and isolate their section of town from the Republican-dominated farmland in the east.

==History==
The area that is now the town of West Warwick was the site of some of the earliest textile mills in the United States situated along the banks of the north and south branches of the Pawtuxet River. These small mill villages of the would play an important role in the early development of the textile industry in North America. Lippitt Mill, founded in 1809 by Revolutionary War hero Christopher Lippitt, was one of the first mills in the area.

The 1810 Lippitt Mill is on the National Register of Historic Places, and is one of the earliest textile mills in Rhode Island. It was founded in 1809 and the current dam was constructed in 1889. The Mill is one of the earliest textile mills in Rhode Island and is one of the oldest American textile mills still used for manufacturing. Another mill center, River Point, is located at the junction of the North and South branches of the Pawtuxet River, and is home to several mills which have been converted to residences, and which make up the Royal Mill Complex. The Original Bradford Soap Works, located in the Valley Queen Mill, dates back to the 1800s and is still in use today.

The Station, a nightclub and music venue on Cowesett Avenue, was destroyed in a fire on February 20, 2003, that killed 100 people and injured 230 others. The fire occurred during a concert by the rock band Great White, when a pyrotechnic display ignited packing foam that had been used to soundproof the building. The site where the Station once stood was turned into a permanent memorial, Station Fire Memorial Park, which was opened in May 2017.

In 2010, a massive rainfall caused the Pawtuxet River to rise to 21 feet, which is 12 feet above flood stage which caused flooding through much of the town.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (2.22%) is water.

The following villages are located in West Warwick:
* Arctic, found in the center of West Warwick where most of the town municipal buildings are located
* Birch Hill, originally an independent village, it stopped identifying as Birch Hill around the end of the nineteenth century, and is considered a part of Clyde. It was located in northern West Warwick on the opposite side of the river from Clyde Printworks. 
* Centerville, home to the second ever mill erected in the United States, and the first textile mill in West Warwick (while it was still a part of Warwick). It is found in the center of West Warwick at the crossroads of Legris Avenue, Main Street, and West Warwick Avenue.
* Clyde
* Crompton
* Harris, located on the north branch of the Pawtuxet River, it has sections in both West Warwick and Coventry. It was named for Elisha Harris, who in 1822 built a new mill opposite the original wooden mill. It was also once known as Harrisville.
* Jericho is now considered a part of Arctic
* Lippitt, home to the historic Lippitt Mill, which was constructed in 1809
* Natick, a neighborhood in the northeast section of the town.
* Phenix, in the northwest corner of the town, is the site of the William B. Spencer home, built in the early 1870s, and now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The area became in later years a mainly Portuguese area.
* River Point, home to the historic Royal Mills and to Horgan Elementary School
* Westcott, one of the only villages that did not grow up around a factory, it provided housing for the mill workers in neighboring Riverpoint. It is located in northern West Warwick, at the juncture of New London Avenue, Tollgate Road, and Providence Street.

The town is bordered by the city of Warwick on the east, the town of Coventry on the west, the city of Cranston on the North, and town of East Greenwich on the south.
