<text>USS &quot;Iowa&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the United States Navy in the mid-1890s. The ship was a marked improvement over the previous s, correcting many of the defects in the design of those vessels. Among the most important improvements were significantly better seaworthiness owing to her greater freeboard and a more efficient arrangement of the armament. &quot;Iowa&quot; was designed to operate on the high seas, which had been the impetus to increase the freeboard. She was armed with a battery of four guns in two twin-gun turrets, supported by a secondary battery of eight guns.

Upon entering service in June 1897, &quot;Iowa&quot; conducted training operations in the Atlantic Ocean before moving to the Caribbean in early 1898 as tensions between the United States and Spain over Cuba grew, leading to the Spanish–American War. The ship took part in the bombardment of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then participated in the blockade of Cuba during the war, and after the Spanish cruiser squadron was found in Santiago de Cuba, she patrolled off the harbor to block their escape. In the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July, &quot;Iowa&quot; assisted in the destruction of three of the four Spanish cruisers. After the war, &quot;Iowa&quot; spent the next several years conducting routine training exercises, serving with the Pacific Squadron from 1898 to 1902, the South Atlantic Squadron until 1904, and the North Atlantic Squadron until 1906, when the latter two units were merged to form the Atlantic Fleet.

&quot;Iowa&quot; was modernized between 1908 and 1910; she thereafter served as a training ship for naval cadets from the United States Naval Academy and for naval militia crews. Removed from service in 1913 and decommissioned in 1914, she was reactivated after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, initially serving as a receiving ship and then as a training vessel and guard ship. She was decommissioned again in 1919, renamed Coast Battleship No. 4, and converted into a radio-controlled target ship. She was used in bombing experiments off the Virginia Capes in 1921 before being sunk as part of Fleet Problem I off the coast of Panama in March 1923 by the battleship .

==Design==
In the early 1880s, the United States Navy began to grapple with the question of coastal defense; the United States at that time had a significant isolationist streak and naval strategy had historically been grounded in commerce raiding. After building the interim armored vessels and , the navy requested funding for additional ships in 1887, and one vessel was authorized for the following year. Conflicting ideas about the vessel that would be built delayed construction and led the Secretary of the Navy, Benjamin F. Tracy, to convene a Policy Board in January 1890. Tracy wanted to build sea-going battleships that could project American naval power overseas, though significant elements in the Navy and the United States Congress preferred shallow-draft coastal-defense ships.

The Board concluded that the distance between Europe and North America would hamper European naval attacks, but the power of the British Royal Navy and the possibility of future political developments warranted the construction of a powerful American battle fleet. The Policy Board issued a call for a fleet that would consist of eight first-class battleships, ten slightly smaller second-class battleships, and five third-class ships, along with substantial numbers of lesser craft to support them. The fleet would be tasked with defending the East Coast of the United States, which required an operational range that could cover as far south as the Caribbean Sea, as the Board had determined that any hostile power would need to seize advance bases there to effectively operate against the United States. The three vessels already authorized—&quot;Maine&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;, and what became the armored cruiser fit in the third category, so larger and more powerful vessels would have to be built to meet the Board&#x27;s recommendations.

Congress, dismayed by the Board&#x27;s conclusions, nevertheless approved funding for three of the first-class battleships in April 1890, which became the s. These were low-freeboard vessels intended for local, coastal defense. They were badly overweight when completed, and as a result suffered from serious problems, including belt armor that was fully submerged when the ships were fully loaded, a tendency to ship excessive amounts of water, and poor handling characteristics. Changes in the control of Congress in late 1890 led to delays for the next ship to be authorized until 19 July 1892, when funds were allocated for a &quot;seagoing coastline battleship&quot;. The vessel was to be built with a displacement of around .

The Policy Board had intended in its original plan that the seagoing ship would trade armor for greater range, but the Bureau of Construction and Repair, responsible for the design of the vessel, decided to reduce the gun armament compared to the &quot;Indiana&quot;s to free up displacement for greater fuel storage. The main battery of the &quot;Indiana&quot; class would be replaced with guns, while some of the secondary guns would be replaced with faster-firing quick-firing guns. Weight would also be saved by the adoption of Harvey armor, which was significantly more effective than compound armor; a thinner belt could thus be used to achieve the same level of protection. The intention to use the new ship for long-range deployments required other changes, in addition to increased coal storage. Since the vessel would necessarily have to operate on the high seas, seaworthiness would have to be improved. This required a greater freeboard, so the ship that was to become &quot;Iowa&quot; was given a raised forecastle deck that extended from the bow to amidships. The hull was lengthened and displaced more than the &quot;Indiana&quot;s. In addition, the heavy 8-inch gun turrets were moved closer together amidships, which reduced the amount of weight toward the ends of the ship, also contributing to improved sea-keeping. The arrangement also reduced blast interference between the 8-inch and the 12-inch guns.

===General characteristics and machinery===
&quot;Iowa&quot; had a length at the waterline of and an overall length of . Her beam measured and she had an average draft of . She had a metacentric height of and a righting arm of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Steering was controlled with a single rudder; while steaming at , she could make a 180-degree turn in , and at a speed of , she could make the turn in .

Her hull featured a tumblehome shape, the only time an American battleship was designed that way. She was fitted with a ram bow, a customary feature of capital ships of the period. It had much greater freeboard than the &quot;Indiana&quot;s, providing her with significantly better sea-keeping qualities. She was completed with a single heavy military mast fitted with fighting tops, which was placed atop the forward conning tower. A large derrick was placed abreast the aft funnel to handle the boats carried aboard. She had a crew of 36 officers and 540 enlisted men.

The ship was powered by a pair of 3-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion steam engines that each drove a screw propeller. Steam was provided by five coal burning fire-tube boilers; three were double-ended boilers while the other two were single-ended versions. The boilers produced steam at . They were ducted into a pair of very tall funnels; these were adopted to improve draft to the boilers. Like the &quot;Indiana&quot; class, &quot;Iowa&quot; was fitted for forced draft, and she had mechanical hoists to remove ash from the boiler rooms. The propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of , though on speed trials she reached and a maximum speed of . Coal storage amounted to . At a speed of 10 knots, she could steam for .

===Armament===
&quot;Iowa&quot; was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets that were mounted on the centerline, one forward and the other aft of the superstructure. The built-up guns were the Mark II type, which were placed in elliptical Mark III turrets. The training gear was hydraulically operated, but elevation was hand-operated only. The gun mounts allowed elevation to 14 degrees and depression to −5 degrees; to reload the guns, they had to be returned to 3 degrees elevation. The ammunition hoists that retrieved shells and propellant charges from the magazines were also hydraulically operated. The guns fired an shell with a charge of brown powder. Muzzle velocity was , and at the muzzle, the shells could penetrate up to of mild steel; at a range of , their penetration capability fell to . The average rate of fire was one shot every five minutes, though fresh, well-trained crews could achieve rates as fast as one shot every three minutes.

The primary armament was supported by a secondary battery of eight /35 cal guns that were carried in four twin-gun wing turrets. Two were placed on either side of the ship, abreast of the funnels. Since the 12-inch guns had a long reloading time, the 8-inch guns were incorporated to increase the number of weapons that could defeat light armor. The 8-inch guns were the Mark IV version, which had a rate of fire of one shot per minute. They had a muzzle velocity of , firing armor-piercing shells. They were initially supplied with brown powder charges, but after the advent of smokeless powder, new, smokeless charges were adopted that increased the rate of fire by twenty seconds. Mounted in Mark VIII turrets with a range of elevation from −7 to 13 degrees, reloading was fixed at 0 degrees.

Six /40 cal quick-firing guns rounded out the secondary battery; these were intended to use their high rate of fire, coupled with high-explosive shells to damage unarmored parts of enemy warships. Four of these were placed in individual casemates in the forecastle deck, two in sponsons in the bow and the other two located amidships. The remaining two guns were in open shielded mounts on the aft superstructure, superfiring over the rear main battery turret. They fired a high-explosive shell at a muzzle velocity of . For defense against torpedo boats, the ship carried a battery of twenty 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and four 1-pounder guns These guns were dispersed around the ship in a variety of individual mounts, including in the fighting top of the military mast, the superstructure, and in sponsons in the hull. She also carried four M1895 Colt–Browning machine guns chambered in 6mm Lee Navy.

As was standard practice for capital ships of the era, &quot;Iowa&quot; carried four above-water, torpedo tubes in her hull, two on each broadside. These launched the Howell torpedo, which had a range of and traveled at a speed of . They carried a warhead.

===Armor===
&quot;Iowa&quot; was protected with Harvey armor, which was fabricated with a new type of process that produced steel that was significantly stronger than traditional compound armor. The main armor belt was 14 in thick in the central portion, where it protected the magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. It extended from above the waterline and below the line, and it extended for a length of of the hull. The belt tapered to at the lower edge. At either end of the belt, angled bulkheads that were 12 in thick connected the belt to the barbettes for the main battery turrets. She had a thick armor deck that was level with the top edge of the belt. On either end of the belt, the deck sloped down on the sides and was increased slightly to to provide the bow and stern with a measure of protection against light guns. Above the belt was a thinner strake of armor that was thick where it protected the 4-inch guns and reduced to where it covered the 57 mm and 37 mm guns.

&quot;Iowa&quot;″s main battery turrets were protected with on the sides and 2 in thick crowns; the rears of the turrets were thick, with the greater weight being used to balance the turret. Their barbettes were also 15 in thick on the exposed sides and reduced to where it was protected by the belt. The secondary turrets had 8 in on the outboard sides and on the inboard sides, where they were less vulnerable. They also had 2-inch roofs. Their barbettes were 8 in thick. Her conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

The keel for &quot;Iowa&quot; was laid down on 5 August 1893 at the William Cramp &amp; Sons shipyard in Philadelphia. Her completed hull was launched on 28 March 1896, and after completing fitting out, the vessel was commissioned into service on 16 June 1897. Captain William T. Sampson served as the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. &quot;Iowa&quot; got underway to begin her shakedown cruise on 13 July, steaming first to Newport, Rhode Island from 16 July to 11 August, moving to Provincetown, Massachusetts the next day. She next departed on 14 August for Portland, Maine, where she stayed from 16 to 23 August, before sailing for Bar Harbor, Maine the next day, where she spent the rest of the month. She then steamed south to Virginia, visiting Hampton Roads from 12 to 16 September, Newport News from 16 to 19 September, a second stop at Hampton Roads from the 16th to the 19th, and finally Yorktown from 27 September to 4 October. &quot;Iowa&quot; then sailed back north for a second visit to Provincetown that lasted from 12 to 14 October and then moved to Boston, staying there from 15 to 22 October.

She made one last port call, in Tompkinsville, New York, from 24 to 29 October, before entering the New York Navy Yard for repairs that lasted from 29 October to 5 January 1898. After emerging from the dry dock, &quot;Iowa&quot; sailed for Virginia, alternating between Hampton Roads and Newport News through mid-January, before departing for Key West, Florida. She then spent the next month and a half cruising between Key West and the Dry Tortugas to the west. During this period, &quot;Maine&quot; exploded and sank in Havana, Cuba; the accidental explosion was initially blamed on a deliberately detonated Spanish naval mine. Sampson was appointed to serve as President of the Board of Inquiry that was sent to investigate the sinking, so Captain Robley D. Evans took his place as &quot;Iowa&quot;″s commander on 24 March. The ship remained in the Florida Keys through 22 April, by which time the Spanish–American War had broken out.

===Spanish–American War===
On 22 April, President William McKinley declared a blockade of western Cuba and three days later, Congress declared war on Spain, retroactively effective as of 21 April. Sampson had by this time taken command of the North Atlantic Squadron, which &quot;Iowa&quot; joined; she took part in the blockade operation from 22 April to 1 May before returning to Key West to replenish fuel. By that time, Sampson had been informed that a Spanish squadron of four armored cruisers and three torpedo boats commanded by Rear Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete had crossed the Atlantic to attack the blockade squadron; he gathered his ships on 4 May to search for them. Sampson had at his disposal his flagship, &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Iowa&quot;, , and the unprotected cruiser , and these ships were soon reinforced by the unprotected cruiser and the monitors and , and later the armored cruiser .

The Americans searched the harbor at Puerto Rico on 12 May, but found no Spanish warships, and so bombarded the port, focusing their fire on Castillo San Felipe del Morro, an old coastal fortress. &quot;Iowa&quot; led the American line of battle on several passes in front of the fort, and she was struck once by a Spanish shell that wounded three men and inflicted minor splinter damage to the ship. During her last 12-inch salvo, one of her forward guns inflicted blast damage to the deck and parts of the superstructure. One man was killed aboard &quot;Brooklyn&quot; and three more were wounded aboard other vessels, but none of the ships was seriously damaged by Spanish fire; American shelling was equally ineffective. Assuming that Cervera was headed for Havana, Sampson took his squadron there, but while en route he learned that the Spanish had been coaling in Saint Thomas in the Danish West Indies. Sampson instead decided to take his ships back to Key West, arriving there on 18 May, while Cervera reached Santiago de Cuba the following day. Sampson detached &quot;Iowa&quot; to reinforce the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley, which was conducting the blockade of Cuba. She joined the squadron off Cienfuegos on 22 May.

The Flying Squadron, which by then consisted of &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;, the battleship , &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, the unprotected cruiser , and several gunboats, auxiliary cruisers, and supporting vessels, spent the next week patrolling off the coast of Cuba, searching for Cervera&#x27;s squadron. On the morning of 29 May, lookouts aboard &quot;Marblehead&quot; reported spotting the Spanish cruiser in the roadstead outside Santiago de Cuba. The American squadron converged on the port over the next two days and prepared for action; &quot;Iowa&quot; coaled at sea on 30 May during this period. Schley made an initial attack on the afternoon of 31 May; he led the line with his flagship &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, followed by the protected cruiser , and then &quot;Iowa&quot; on a pass in front of Cervera&#x27;s ships, opening fire at long range at 14:05. The American shells fell short and they gradually shifted their fire, but they failed to score any hits, though Evans noted that he believed they had inflicted splinter damage. Spanish return fire was similarly inaccurate, and both sides had checked fire by 15:10, by which time the American ships had broken off.

The next day, Sampson arrived on the scene and boarded &quot;New York&quot; to take command of the blockade. The approach to Santiago de Cuba was guarded by coastal artillery and mines, which prevented Sampson&#x27;s ships from breaking into the inner harbor without taking serious damage. But the American squadron was too powerful for the Spanish to attempt to break out. Both sides spent the next month in the resulting stalemate; the Americans preferred to wait until ground forces could attack the port from the land side and seize the coastal batteries. During this period, &quot;Iowa&quot; withdrew to Guantánamo Bay from 18 to 28 June, which had been seized by American forces by that time. She returned to bombard the coastal fortifications on 1 and 2 July in company with &quot;Indiana&quot; and the battleship . By early July, American troops were beginning to approach the hills outside Santiago de Cuba, threatening the coastal batteries that protected Cervera&#x27;s ships, and prompting the Spanish command to order him to attempt a break out. Cervera did not believe he possessed a significant chance of success, as his ships were in poor condition by that time and most of his ships&#x27; crews were poorly trained. He nevertheless complied with the directive and sent a gunboat to surreptitiously clear a path in the minefield on the night of 2 July.

====Battle of Santiago de Cuba====


At 08:45 on 3 July, Cervera sortied with his flag aboard the cruiser , followed by &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;, and and the destroyers and . &quot;Iowa&quot; was in her blockade station, steaming at about when her men were called from their quarters for the morning inspection at 09:15. The Spaniards cleared the roadstead at 09:35; luckily for the Spanish, &quot;New York&quot; was out of position at the time and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was replenishing her coal at Guantánamo Bay. Toward the end of inspection aboard &quot;Iowa&quot;, lookouts aboard &quot;Brooklyn&quot; spotted Cervera approaching and fired one of her guns to warn the other American ships, which quickly ordered their crews to general quarters. As the Spanish ships attempted to break out to the west, Cervera charged at &quot;Brooklyn&quot; with &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; to delay the American pursuit and give his other ships time to escape. The Spanish coastal batteries also contributed their fire in the first stage of the battle but had little effect.

&quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, and &quot;Texas&quot; opened fire at about 09:40 at a range of about . &quot;Iowa&quot; quickly got steam in her boilers up to increase speed to close with the fleeing cruisers; the range fell steadily until she was just away from &quot;Infanta Maria Theresa&quot;. &quot;Iowa&quot; fired a broadside at the cruiser and then turned to port to cross the t of &quot;Vizcaya&quot;, though the Spanish cruiser turned to avoid the maneuver. &quot;Iowa&quot; nevertheless fired a broadside at a range of before turning to port and then back to starboard to come alongside &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot;. The two ships were about apart and &quot;Iowa&quot;″s entire battery opened fire, enveloping her in thick black smoke and hampering her gunners&#x27; ability to spot targets. &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; and &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; engaged &quot;Iowa&quot;, and one of the vessels struck her with what was estimated to be a shell. It failed to explode, but still tore a large hole in the side of her hull. A second shell from one of the cruisers struck &quot;Iowa&quot; and exploded, causing relatively minor damage and starting a fire that was quickly put out. Several small shells struck her upper works, including her bridge and funnels, but the damage inflicted was minimal.

By this point in the battle, heavy American gunfire had set &quot;Infanta Maria Theresa&quot; on fire, and, fearing a magazine explosion, Cervara ordered her run aground at 10:25. &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot;″s captain issued similar instructions five minutes later, as his ship, too, was burning badly. &quot;Vizcaya&quot; was also forced ashore shortly thereafter, but her flag remained flying, so &quot;Iowa&quot; continued to bombard the vessel until she hauled it down at 10:36, a sign of surrender. Meanwhile, the two Spanish destroyers had also been badly damaged by the American battleships; &quot;Indiana&quot; had nearly cut &quot;Plutón&quot; in half with a 13-inch shell, forcing her to run aground, where she exploded. And &quot;Furor&quot; had been savaged by &quot;Iowa&quot;″s, &quot;Oregon&quot;″s, and &quot;Indiana&quot;″s secondary batteries, leading her crew to surrender to the gunboat . &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; managed to break away from the American fleet for a time, but she also ran aground later in the day.

At around 11:00, &quot;Iowa&quot; lowered five of her cutters to pick up the crews of the wrecked cruisers. Among the men rescued was Captain Antonio Eulate, &quot;Vizcaya&quot;″s commander; he attempted to surrender his sword to Evans, but he returned it to Eulate. In total, &quot;Iowa&quot; picked up 23 officers and 248 enlisted men, of whom 32 were wounded. Her crew also recovered the bodies of five men who were then buried with military honors. In addition, &quot;Iowa&quot;″s boats also transferred men to other vessels in the American fleet. On 20 July, four days after the Spanish garrison at Santiago de Cuba surrendered, &quot;Iowa&quot; suffered a boiler accident while she was patrolling off the city. The manhole gasket on one of her boilers blew out, sending boiling water out into the boiler room. The crew set a board across a bucket and Fireman 2nd Class Robert Penn climbed across to shut off the boiler, risking being badly burned, and he was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions.

===1898–1904===
&quot;Iowa&quot; left Cuban waters after Spain surrendered in August, arriving in New York on 20 August. Captain Silas Terry took command of the ship on 24 September and on 12 October, she departed for the West Coast of the United States, where she was to join the Pacific Squadron. The next year passed uneventfully and &quot;Iowa&quot; put into the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul that began on 11 June 1899. She took part in training exercises off San Diego, California from 20 December to 15 January 1900. On the first day of the exercises, &quot;Iowa&quot; lost one of her Howell torpedoes after the practice warhead likely detached after it was launched. In March 2012, a pair of dolphins that were part of the Navy&#x27;s Marine Mammal Program recovered the torpedo, which was missing the practice warhead; the section recovered was later transferred to the Underwater Archaeology Branch for preservation. The torpedo is one of three Howell torpedoes known to exist. During the period in San Diego, she received a pair of 3-inch field guns and four M1895 Colt-Brownings that were chambered in .30-40 Krag for use by landing parties ashore. After the training exercises, &quot;Iowa&quot; underwent a refit, after which she resumed her peacetime routine of training exercises, shooting practice, and cruises in the eastern Pacific. Captain Philip H. Cooper took command of the ship on 9 June, serving as her commander until 1 April 1901. On 8 September, the sailing ship collided with her while she was at anchor in San Francisco Bay and then collided with a barque and sank.

In early February 1902, she was transferred to the South Atlantic Squadron to serve as its flagship. During this period, she visited a number of foreign ports, including Montevideo, Uruguay from late July to 2 August, Santos, Brazil from 6 to 7 August, Salvador, Brazil from 11 August to 8 September, Trade Island from 8 to 14 September, Montevideo again from 22 to 28 September, Puerto Belgrano, Argentina from 28 September to 19 October, Montevideo a third time from 22 October to 6 November, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from 10 to 18 November. From there, she steamed north to the West Indies, stopping in the Gulf of Paria from 29 November to 4 December. She then took part in a search exercise off Mayagüez, Puerto Rico from 9 to 10 December. She then joined maneuvers off Culebra, Puerto Rico between 11 and 19 December, before steaming to visit Saint Lucia on 21 December. The next day, she traveled to Port of Spain, Trinidad, where she stayed until 28 December. &quot;Iowa&quot; returned to Culebra on 30 December and lay there through 1 February 1903. The ship visited St. Kitts from 2 to 6 February and Ponce, Puerto Rico from 6 to 11 February before turning north for New York the next day. She took an indirect route, visiting Galveston, Texas, from 18 to 26 February and Pensacola, Florida, from 28 February to 1 April. She took part in shooting practice there from 1 to 9 April, during which one of her main battery guns exploded. She underwent repairs at the Pensacola Navy Yard from 9 to 23 April, and then resumed her voyage northward. She reached Cape Henry, Virginia, staying there from 28 to 30 April, then Tompkinsville from 1 to 7 May; she finally reached the New York Navy Yard later on 7 May. She was decommissioned there on 30 June.

On 23 December, &quot;Iowa&quot; was recommissioned and underwent a refit that included replacing the 4-inch guns on her aft superstructure with a pair of 6-pounder guns in early January 1904. She then joined the North Atlantic Squadron, which was then in European waters. She visited Piraeus, Greece, from 30 June to 6 July, the island of Corfu from 8 to 9 July, and then Trieste and Fiume in Austria-Hungary for the rest of the month. On 2 August, she crossed the Adriatic to Palermo, Italy, staying there for three days before getting underway for Gibraltar, which she visited from 9 to 13 August. She then re-crossed the Atlantic, stopping in Horta in the Azores from 18 to 20 August. The ship reached Menemsha, Massachusetts on 29 August and stayed there until 5 September, waiting for her turn at the Navy&#x27;s target range off Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. She conducted gunnery practice there from 5 to 19 September before returning to Tompkinsville from 30 September to 5 October and then moved to New York City, anchoring in the Hudson River from 5 to 20 October, while she waited for a dry dock to open up at the Norfolk Navy Yard. She then sailed south to Norfolk and arrived on 22 October, where she was docked from 24 October to 24 December for periodic maintenance; she was then moved to Newport News Shipbuilding for dry-docking from 24 to 30 December.

===1905–1908===

After emerging from dry dock, &quot;Iowa&quot; rejoined the fleet on 3 January 1905 at Hampton Roads and Captain Benjamin Franklin Tilley took command of the vessel on 14 January. The ship then took part in a series of maneuvers with the rest of the squadron off Culebra in mid January, Guantánamo Bay from 19 February to 22 March, and then Pensacola from 27 March to 3 May. She then returned to Hampton Roads on 7 May for repairs at Norfolk that lasted from 9 May to 24 June. She helped to test the new floating dry dock from 25 to 30 June, thereafter returning to Newport News for periodic maintenance from 30 June to 3 July. &quot;Iowa&quot; then sailed north to New England, visiting several ports, including Provincetown, Newport, Bar Harbor, Boston, and New York over the course of the next four months. She arrived back in Hampton Roads on 13 October, where she remained until the end of the month, when she sailed to visit Annapolis, Maryland, from 30 October to 7 November.

&quot;Iowa&quot; then steamed to North River, New York, staying there from 8 to 20 November, before returning to Hampton Roads for another refit at the Norfolk Navy Yard from 22 November to 23 December. She then returned to New York for a short dry-docking from 26 to 28 December before sailing back south to Hampton Roads on the last day of the year. She lay there through 17 January 1906 before getting underway for the Caribbean, stopping in Culebra from 22 January to 6 February, Barbados from 8 to 15 February, and then Guantánamo Bay from 19 February to 31 March. Shooting practice followed from 1 to 10 April off Cape Cruz, Cuba. &quot;Iowa&quot; then steamed north to Annapolis to participate in the ceremonial return of John Paul Jones after his remains had been exhumed from his original grave in Paris so they could be re-interred at the US Naval Academy. The battleship then operated off the East Coast, stopping in Hampton Roads, Newport News, and New York between late April and mid-May. While in New York in early May, she had two of her torpedo tubes removed. She then underwent an overhaul in Norfolk from 14 May to 30 June.

The ship next moved to Tompkinsville in early July, coaling there before being dry-docked at the New York Navy Yard for repairs from 6 to 15 July. She then joined the ships of the Second Division of what was now the Atlantic Fleet for a tour of New England, stopping in a series of ports in the region through the end of August. She was present for a fleet review held on 1–2 September, which was observed by President Theodore Roosevelt. She then returned to New England waters for shooting practice in late September and early October, after which she steamed south to Norfolk for repairs. She took part in tests with equipment that would allow the ship to replenish coal while underway in mid-December. The ship ended the year cruising with the rest of the fleet off the central East Coast, putting in at Hampton Roads on 31 December. The fleet steamed south to Cuba in early January 1907 for maneuvers that were held off Guantánamo Bay from 7 January to 10 February. &quot;Iowa&quot; then visited Cienfuegos in mid February and Guantánamo from mid-February to mid-March. Further gunnery practice was held from 16 March to 6 April.

&quot;Iowa&quot; was present for the Jamestown Exposition later in April, which marked the 300th anniversary of the foundation of the Jamestown Colony. The ship rejoined the fleet for a visit to North River from 16 May to 5 June, after which she operated with the Fourth Division for maneuvers off the coast of Virginia. After returning to Hampton Roads on 28 June, she was reduced to reserve on 6 July at the Norfolk Navy Yard. That day, Lieutenant Commander Clarence Stewart Williams took command of the vessel. The ship was moved to Philadelphia and was decommissioned there on 23 July 1908. While out of service, the ship had a series of improvements made, including the installation of new hydraulic equipment for her 12-inch turrets and a lattice mast aft of her funnels. The magazines and shell hoists for her 4-inch guns were modified to improve shell handling.

===1910–1919===
&quot;Iowa&quot; was moved to the New York Navy Yard, where she was recommissioned on 2 May 1910, with Commander William H. G. Bullard serving as her captain. She got underway on 23 May, joining the Naval Academy Practice Squadron the next day. After embarking contingents of midshipmen from the Naval Academy, the ships in the squadron began a training cruise to Europe. Stops on the tour included Plymouth, Great Britain, from 23 to 30 June; Marseille, France, from 8 to 15 July; Gibraltar from 19 to 24 July; Funchal, Madeira, from 27 July to 2 August; and Horta, Azores from 5 to 12 August. The ships then returned to the United States, disembarking the midshipmen at the end of the month. From 6 to 19 September, she was in dock at the New York Navy Yard to have another coaling-at-sea apparatus installed; she conducted tests with the collier on 22 September. &quot;Iowa&quot; then returned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard four days later, where she was again reduced to reserve.

On 3 May 1911, &quot;Iowa&quot; returned to active service for another cruise with the Naval Academy Practice Squadron from 13 May to 5 June. While en route to join the squadron on 12 May, she and rescued passengers from the sinking Ward liner after she collided with the United Fruit Company&#x27;s steamship &quot;Admiral Farragut&quot; some east of Cape Charles, Virginia in dense fog; all 319 passengers on &quot;Merida&quot; remained alive. The ships then took on midshipmen for another voyage to Europe, stopping at Queenstown, Ireland from 18 to 27 June; Kiel, Germany from 2 to 12 July; Bergen, Norway from 14 to 24 July; and Gibraltar from 2 to 8 August. After returning to the United States, the ships disembarked their cadets at Annapolis on 28–29 August. &quot;Iowa&quot; was again decommissioned in Philadelphia on 1 September. She was briefly mobilized between 28 October and 2 November as part of a mobilization exercise, during which she was moved to New York and then returned to Philadelphia.

&quot;Iowa&quot; was recommissioned in July 1912 for a training cruise for naval militia members. The cruise, conducted between 2 and 21 July, included stops in Newport, Tangier Sound, Chesapeake Bay, Baltimore, Maryland, New York, and Annapolis. The next day, she was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, based in Philadelphia. She was detached on 8 October to take part in a fleet review held in Philadelphia from 10 to 15 October. She was placed in ordinary on 30 April 1913 in Philadelphia and was formally decommissioned on 23 May 1914.

After the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;Iowa&quot; was placed in limited commission on 23 April for use as a receiving ship for naval recruits. She remained in Philadelphia for six months before being moved to Hampton Roads, where she spent the rest of the conflict. While there, she was employed as a training vessel for new recruits and a guard ship defending the entrance to Chesapeake Bay through the end of the war in November 1918. On 31 March 1919, &quot;Iowa&quot; was decommissioned for the last time, and on 30 April, she was renamed &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; so that her name could be reused for the . The new ship was laid down the next year, but was cancelled before completion as a result of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty.

===Target ship===
With no further use for the ship by 1919, the Navy decided to convert &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; into a radio-controlled target ship. She was briefly struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 4 February 1920 before the order was reversed six days later. She was subsequently turned over to the captain of the battleship on 2 August. &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; was converted for radio control in Philadelphia, with a wireless receiver that could control both the steering and speed of the ship as well as pumps to control the boilers, which were replaced with oil-fired versions. She was then moved from Philadelphia to Hampton Roads under radio control, departing on 17 August without any crew aboard, her speed and course being directed from the deck of &quot;Ohio&quot;. Tests to determine the effectiveness of control from &quot;Ohio&quot; were conducted there through 10 September, when the Navy was informed of their success.

In June 1921, the Navy and Army conducted a series of bombing tests off the Virginia Capes to evaluate the effectiveness of aircraft against warships. The Navy also sought to determine the ability of internal compartmentalization to resist flooding from bomb attacks. &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; was used as part of these experiments on 29 June as a moving target. It took Navy aircraft nearly two hours to locate her after being informed of her presence in a area; she was then attacked with dummy bombs. The aircraft scored two hits, out of eighty bombs dropped. The Army refused to participate in the attacks on &quot;Iowa&quot;, as General Billy Mitchell complained that attacking with simulated bombs had little merit. The ability of the ship to maneuver significantly hindered the aircrews&#x27; ability to locate and attack the vessel, and the Navy called off further attempts with live munitions that the Army requested.

&quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; was then laid up in Philadelphia, where she was reclassified as an &quot;unclassified miscellaneous auxiliary&quot; with the hull number of IX-6 on 21 July. She next went to sea in April 1922 for shooting practice off the Virginia Capes with now serving as her control ship, but the exercises were cancelled and she returned to port. The ship was moved to the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal for shooting practice with the new battleship as part of Fleet Problem I in February 1923, which was to simulate an attack on the Canal Zone. &quot;Shawmut&quot; reprised her role as command ship. The first set of drills consisted of 5-inch fire from &quot;Mississippi&quot;″s secondary battery at a range of around . Two further sets of practice shoots involved her 14-inch main guns at longer ranges. The second of these was conducted on 23 March, and &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; was struck by three of the projectiles, which inflicted serious damage and sank her. The battleship fired a 21-gun salute as the old battleship sank. She was formally stricken from the register on 27 March, and her wreck was sold to marine salvors on 8 November.

<doc id="189610" wikidata="Q671602" url="?curid=189610" title="USS Maine (1889)">
<text>Maine was a United States Navy ship that sank in Havana Harbor on 15 February 1898, contributing to the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April. U.S. newspapers, engaging in yellow journalism to boost circulation, claimed that the Spanish were responsible for the ship&#x27;s destruction. The phrase, &quot;Remember the &quot;Maine!&quot; To hell with Spain!&quot; became a rallying cry for action. Although the &quot;Maine&quot; explosion was not a direct cause, it served as a catalyst that accelerated the events leading up to the war.

&quot;Maine&quot; is described as an armored cruiser or second-class battleship, depending on the source. Commissioned in 1886, she was the first U.S. Navy ship to be named after the state of Maine. &quot;Maine&quot; and its contemporary the battleship were both represented as an advance in American warship design, reflecting the latest European naval developments. Both ships had two-gun turrets staggered &quot;en échelon&quot;, and full sailing masts were omitted due to the increased reliability of steam engines. Due to a protracted 9-year construction period, &quot;Maine&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot; were obsolete by the time of completion. Far more advanced vessels were either in service or nearing completion that year.

&quot;Maine&quot; was sent to Havana Harbor to protect U.S. interests during the Cuban War of Independence. She exploded and sank on the evening of 15 February 1898, killing 268 sailors, or three-quarters of her crew. In 1898, a U.S. Navy board of inquiry ruled that the ship had been sunk by an external explosion from a mine. However, some U.S. Navy officers disagreed with the board, suggesting that the ship&#x27;s magazines had been ignited by a spontaneous fire in a coal bunker. The coal used in &quot;Maine&quot; was bituminous, which is known for releasing firedamp, a mixture of gases composed primarily of flammable methane that is prone to spontaneous explosions. An investigation by Admiral Hyman Rickover in 1974 agreed with the coal fire hypothesis, penning a 1976 monograph that argued for this conclusion. The cause of her sinking remains a subject of debate.

The ship lay at the bottom of the harbor until 1911, when a cofferdam was built around it. The hull was patched up until the ship was afloat, then she was towed to sea and sunk. &quot;Maine&quot; now lies on the seabed below the surface. The ship&#x27;s main mast is now a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery.

== Background ==

In response to the delivery of the in 1883 and the acquisition of other modern armored warships from Europe by Brazil, Argentina and Chile, the head of the House Naval Affairs Committee, Hilary A. Herbert, stated to Congress: &quot;if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by &quot;Riachuelo&quot; it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port.&quot; These developments helped bring to a head a series of discussions that had been taking place at the Naval Advisory Board since 1881. The board knew at that time that the U.S. Navy could not challenge any major European fleet; at best, it could wear down an opponent&#x27;s merchant fleet and hope to make some progress through general attrition. Moreover, projecting naval force abroad through the use of battleships ran counter to the government policy of isolationism. While some on the board supported a strict policy of commerce raiding, others argued it would be ineffective against the potential threat of enemy battleships stationed near the American coast. The two sides remained essentially deadlocked until &quot;Riachuelo&quot; manifested.

The board, now confronted with the concrete possibility of hostile warships operating off the American coast, began planning for ships to protect it in 1884. The ships had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major American ports and bases. The maximum beam was similarly fixed, and the board concluded that at a length of about , the maximum displacement would be about 7,000 tons. A year later the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C &amp; R) presented two designs to Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney, one for a 7,500-ton battleship and one for a 5,000-ton armored cruiser. Whitney decided instead to ask Congress for two 6,000-ton warships, and they were authorized in August 1886. A design contest was held, asking naval architects to submit designs for the two ships: armored cruiser &quot;Maine&quot; and battleship . It was specified that &quot;Maine&quot; had to have a speed of , a ram bow, and a double bottom, and be able to carry two torpedo boats. Her armament was specified as: four guns, six guns, various light weapons, and four torpedo tubes. It was specifically stated that the main guns &quot;must afford heavy bow and stern fire.&quot; Armor thickness and many details were also defined. Specifications for &quot;Texas&quot; were similar but demanded a main battery of two guns and slightly thicker armor.

The winning design for &quot;Maine&quot; was from Theodore D. Wilson, who served as chief constructor for C &amp; R and was a member on the Naval Advisory Board in 1881. He had designed a number of other warships for the navy. The winning design for &quot;Texas&quot; was from a British designer, William John, who was working for the Barrow Shipbuilding Company at that time. Both designs resembled the Brazilian battleship &quot;Riachuelo&quot;, having the main gun turrets positioned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned. The winning design for &quot;Maine&quot;, though conservative and inferior to other contenders, may have received special consideration due to a requirement that one of the two new ships be American–designed.

Congress authorized construction of &quot;Maine&quot; on 3 August 1886, and her keel was laid down on 17 October 1888, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. She was the largest vessel built in a U.S. Navy yard up to that time.

== Design ==

&quot;Maine&quot;″s building time of nine years was unusually protracted as a result of the limits of American industry at the time. (The delivery of her armored plating took three years, and a fire in the drafting room of the building yard, where &quot;Maine&quot;″s working set of blueprints were stored, caused further delay.) During the nine-year construction span, naval tactics and technology changed radically and left &quot;Maine&quot;″s role in the navy ill-defined. At the time when she was laid down, armored cruisers such as &quot;Maine&quot; were intended to serve as small battleships on overseas service and were built with heavy belt armor. Great Britain, France and Russia had constructed such ships to serve this purpose and sold others of this type, including &quot;Riachuelo&quot;, to second-rate navies. Within a decade, this role had changed to one of commerce raiding, for which fast, long-range vessels, with only limited armor protection, were needed. The advent of lightweight armor, such as Harvey steel, made this transformation possible.

As a result of these changing priorities, &quot;Maine&quot; was caught between two separate positions and could not perform either one adequately. She lacked both the armor and firepower to serve as a ship-of-the-line against enemy battleships and the speed to serve as a cruiser. Nevertheless, she was expected to fulfill more than one tactical function. In addition, because of the potential of a warship sustaining blast damage to herself from cross-deck and end-on fire, &quot;Maine&quot;″s main-gun arrangement was obsolete by the time she entered service.

=== General characteristics ===
&quot;Maine&quot; was long overall, with a beam of , a maximum draft of and a displacement of . She was divided into 214 watertight compartments. A centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separated the engines and a double bottom covered the hull only from the foremast to the aft end of the armored citadel, a distance of . She had a metacentric height of as designed and was fitted with a ram bow.
&quot;Maine&quot;″s hull was long and narrow, more like that of a cruiser than that of &quot;Texas&quot;, which was wide-beamed. Normally, this would have made &quot;Maine&quot; the faster ship of the two, but &quot;Maine&quot;″s weight distribution was ill-balanced, which slowed her considerably. Her main turrets, awkwardly situated on a cutaway gundeck, were nearly awash in bad weather. Because they were mounted toward the ends of the ship, away from its center of gravity, &quot;Maine&quot; was also prone to greater motion in heavy seas. While she and &quot;Texas&quot; were both considered seaworthy, the latter&#x27;s high hull and guns mounted on her main deck made her the drier ship.

The two main gun turrets were sponsoned over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow both to fire fore and aft. The practice of &quot;en echelon&quot; mounting had begun with Italian battleships designed in the 1870s by Benedetto Brin and followed by the British Navy with , which was laid down in 1874 but not commissioned until October 1881. This gun arrangement met the design demand for heavy end-on fire in a ship-to-ship encounter, tactics that involved ramming the enemy vessel. The wisdom of this tactic was largely theoretical at the time when it was implemented. A drawback of an &quot;en echelon&quot; layout limited the ability for a ship to fire broadside, a key factor when employed in a line of battle. To allow for at least partial broadside fire, &quot;Maine&quot;″s superstructure was separated into three structures. This allowed both turrets to fire across the ship&#x27;s deck (cross-deck fire), between the sections. This ability was limited as the superstructure restricted each turret&#x27;s arc of fire.

This profile view and plan show &quot;Maine&quot; with eight six-pounder guns. Another early published plan shows the same. In both cases, the photographs show a single extreme bow mounted six-pounder and confirm that she did not carry that gun. &quot;Maine&quot;″s armament setup in the bow was not identical to that of the stern, which had a single six-pounder mounted at extreme aft of the vessel. &quot;Maine&quot; carried two six-pounders forward, two on the bridge and three on the stern section, all one level above the abbreviated gun deck that permitted the ten-inch guns to fire across the deck. The six-pounders located in the bow were positioned more forward than were the pair mounted aft, which necessitated the far aft single six-pounder.

=== Propulsion ===

&quot;Maine&quot; was the first American capital ship for which its power plant was afforded as high a priority as was its fighting strength. Her machinery, built by the N. F. Palmer Jr. &amp; Company&#x27;s Quintard Iron Works of New York, was the first designed for a major ship under the direct supervision of Arctic explorer and future commodore George Wallace Melville. She had two inverted vertical triple-expansion steam engines, mounted in watertight compartments and separated by a fore-to-aft bulkhead, with a total designed output of . Cylinder diameters were (high-pressure), (intermediate pressure) and (low-pressure). Stroke for all three pistons was .

Melville mounted &quot;Maine&quot;″s engines with the cylinders in vertical mode, a departure from conventional practice. Previous ships had had their engines mounted in horizontal mode so that they would be completely protected below the waterline. Melville believed that a ship&#x27;s engines needed ample room to operate and that any exposed parts could be protected by an armored deck. He therefore opted for the greater efficiency, lower maintenance costs and higher speeds offered by the vertical mode. The engines were constructed with the high-pressure cylinder aft and the low-pressure cylinder forward. According to the ship&#x27;s chief engineer A. W. Morley, this was done so that the low-pressure cylinder could be disconnected when the ship was under low power. This allowed the high and intermediate-power cylinders to be run together as a compound engine for efficient running.

Eight single-ended Scotch marine boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of at a temperature . On trials, she reached a speed of , failing to meet her contract speed of . She carried a maximum load of of coal in 20 bunkers, 10 on each side, which extended below the protective deck. Wing bunkers at each end of each fire room extended inboard to the front of the boilers. This was a very low capacity for a ship of &quot;Maine&quot;″s rating, which limited her time at sea and her ability to run at flank speed, when coal consumption increased dramatically. &quot;Maine&quot;″s overhanging main turrets also prevented coaling at sea, except in the calmest of waters; otherwise, the potential for damage to a collier, herself or both vessels was extreme.

&quot;Maine&quot; also carried two small dynamos to power her searchlights and provide interior lighting.

&quot;Maine&quot; was designed initially with a three-mast barque rig for auxiliary propulsion in case of engine failure and to aid long-range cruising. This arrangement was limited to &quot;two-thirds&quot; of full sail power, determined by the ship&#x27;s tonnage and immersed cross-section. The mizzen mast was removed in 1892, after the ship had been launched, but before her completion. &quot;Maine&quot; was completed with a two-mast military rig and the ship never spread any canvas.

=== Armament ===

==== Main guns ====
&quot;Maine&quot;″s main armament consisted of four /30 caliber Mark II guns, which had a maximum elevation of 15° and could depress to −3°. Ninety rounds per gun were carried. The ten-inch guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of at maximum elevation. These guns were mounted in twin hydraulically powered Mark 3 turrets, the fore turret sponsoned to starboard and the aft turret sponsoned to port.

The 10-inch guns were initially to be mounted in open barbettes (the C &amp; R proposal blueprint shows them as such). During &quot;Maine&quot;″s extended construction, the development of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns, which could fire high-explosive shells, became a serious threat and the navy redesigned &quot;Maine&quot; with enclosed turrets. Because of the corresponding weight increase, the turrets were mounted one deck lower than planned originally. Even with this modification, the main guns were high enough to fire unobstructed for 180° on one side and 64° on the other side. They could also be loaded at any angle of train; initially the main guns of &quot;Texas&quot;, by comparison, with external rammers, could be loaded only when trained on the centerline or directly abeam, a common feature in battleships built before 1890. By 1897, &quot;Texas&quot;″ turrets had been modified with internal rammers to permit much faster reloading.

The &quot;en echelon&quot; arrangement proved problematic. Because &quot;Maine&quot;″s turrets were not counterbalanced, she heeled over if both were pointed in the same direction, which reduced the range of the guns. Also, cross-deck firing damaged her deck and superstructure significantly due to the vacuum from passing shells. Because of this, and the potential for undue hull stress if the main guns were fired end-on, the &quot;en echelon&quot; arrangement was not used in U.S. Navy designs after &quot;Maine&quot; and &quot;Texas&quot;.

==== Secondary and light guns ====

The six /30 caliber Mark 3 guns were mounted in casemates in the hull, two each at the bow and stern and the last two amidships. Data is lacking, but they could probably depress to −7° and elevate to +12°. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of about . They had a maximum range of at full elevation.

The anti-torpedo boat armament consisted of seven Driggs-Schroeder six-pounder guns mounted on the superstructure deck. They fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a maximum range of . The lighter armament comprised four each Hotchkiss and Driggs-Schroeder one-pounder guns. Four of these were mounted on the superstructure deck, two were mounted in small casemates at the extreme stern and one was mounted in each fighting top. They fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about at a rate of 30 rounds per minute to a range about .

&quot;Maine&quot; had four above-water torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. In addition, she was designed to carry two steam-powered torpedo boats, each with a single torpedo tube and a one-pounder gun. Only one was built, but it had a top speed of only a little over so it was transferred to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, as a training craft.

=== Armor ===
The main waterline belt, made of nickel steel, had a maximum thickness of and tapered to at its lower edge. It was long and covered the machinery spaces and the 10-inch magazines. It was high, of which was above the design waterline. It angled inwards for at each end, thinning to , to provide protection against raking fire. A 6-inch transverse bulkhead closed off the forward end of the armored citadel. The forward portion of the protective deck ran from the bulkhead all the way to the bow and served to stiffen the ram. The deck sloped downwards to the sides, but its thickness increased to . The rear portion of the protective deck sloped downwards towards the stern, going below the waterline, to protect the propeller shafts and steering gear. The sides of the circular turrets were 8 inches thick. The barbettes were 12 inches thick, with their lower portions reduced to 10 inches. The conning tower had 10-inch walls. The ship&#x27;s voicepipes and electrical leads were protected by an armored tube thick.

Two flaws emerged in &quot;Maine&quot;″s protection, both due to technological developments between her laying-down and her completion. The first was a lack of adequate topside armor to counter the effects of rapid-fire intermediate-caliber guns and high-explosive shells. This was a flaw she shared with &quot;Texas&quot;. The second was the use of nickel-steel armor. Introduced in 1889, nickel steel was the first modern steel alloy armor and, with a figure of merit of 0.67, was an improvement over the 0.6 rating of mild steel used until then. Harvey steel and Krupp armors, both of which appeared in 1893, had merit figures of between 0.9 and 1.2, giving them roughly twice the tensile strength of nickel steel. Although all three armors shared the same density (about 40 pounds per square foot for a one-inch-thick plate), six inches of Krupp or Harvey steel gave the same protection as 10 inches of nickel. The weight thus saved could be applied either to additional hull structure and machinery or to achieving higher speed. The navy would incorporate Harvey armor in the s, designed after &quot;Maine&quot;, but commissioned at roughly the same time.

== Launching and delay ==

&quot;Maine&quot; was launched on 18 November 1889, sponsored by Alice Tracy Wilmerding, the granddaughter of Navy Secretary Benjamin F. Tracy. Not long afterwards, a reporter wrote for &quot;Marine Engineer and Naval Architect&quot; magazine, &quot;it cannot be denied that the navy of the United States is making rapid strides towards taking a credible position among the navies of the world, and the launch of the new armoured battleship &quot;Maine&quot; from the Brooklyn Navy Yard ... has added a most powerful unit to the United States fleet of turret ships.&quot; In his 1890 annual report to congress, the Secretary of the Navy wrote, &quot;the &quot;Maine&quot; ... stands in a class by herself&quot; and expected the ship to be commissioned by July 1892.

A three-year delay ensued, while the shipyard waited for nickel steel plates for &quot;Maine&quot;″s armor. Bethlehem Steel had promised the navy 300 tons per month by December 1889 and had ordered heavy castings and forging presses from the British firm of Armstrong Whitworth in 1886 to fulfil its contract. This equipment did not arrive until 1889, pushing back Bethlehem&#x27;s timetable. In response, Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy secured a second contractor, the newly expanded Homestead mill of Carnegie, Phipps &amp; Company. In November 1890, Tracy and Andrew Carnegie signed a contract for Homestead to supply 6000 tons of nickel steel. Homestead was, what author Paul Krause calls, &quot;the last union stronghold in the steel mills of the Pittsburgh district.&quot; The mill had already weathered one strike in 1882 and a lockout in 1889 in an effort to break the union there. Less than two years later, came the Homestead Strike of 1892, one of the largest, most serious disputes in U.S. labor history.

A photo of the christening shows Wilmerding striking the bow near the plimsoll line depth of 13, which caused speculation that the ship was &quot;unlucky&quot; from the launching.

== Operations ==

&quot;Maine&quot; was commissioned on 17 September 1895, under the command of Captain Arent S. Crowninshield. On 5 November 1895, &quot;Maine&quot; steamed to Sandy Hook Bay, New Jersey. She anchored there two days, then proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, for fitting out and test firing of her torpedoes. After a trip, later that month, to Portland, Maine, she reported to the North Atlantic Squadron for operations, training maneuvers and fleet exercises. &quot;Maine&quot; spent her active career with the North Atlantic Squadron, operating from Norfolk, Virginia, along the East Coast of the United States and the Caribbean. On 10 April 1897, Captain Charles Dwight Sigsbee relieved Captain Crowninshield as commander of &quot;Maine&quot;.

== Sinking ==
In January 1898, &quot;Maine&quot; was sent from Key West, Florida, to Havana, Cuba to protect American interests during the Cuban War of Independence. She arrived at 11:00 local time on 25 January. At 21:40 on 15 February, an explosion on the &quot;Maine&quot; occurred in the Havana harbor (). Later investigations revealed that more than of powder charges for the vessel&#x27;s six- and ten-inch guns had detonated, obliterating the forward third of the ship. The remaining wreckage rapidly settled to the bottom of the harbor.

Most of &quot;Maine&quot;″s crew were sleeping or resting in the enlisted quarters, in the forward part of the ship, when the explosion occurred. The ship&#x27;s crew consisted of 355 men: 26 officers, 290 enlisted sailors and 39 marines. Of these, there were 261 fatalities:
* Two officers and 251 enlisted sailors or marines were killed by the explosion or drowned
* Seven others were rescued but soon died of their injuries
* One officer later died of &quot;cerebral affection&quot; (shock)
Of the 94 survivors, 16 were uninjured. Captain Sigsbee and most of the officers survived because their quarters were in the aft portion of the ship. The &quot;City of Washington&quot;, an American merchant steamship, aided in rescuing the crew.

The cause of the accident was immediately debated. Waking President McKinley to break the news, commander Francis W. Dickins called it an &quot;accident&quot;. Commodore George Dewey, commander of the Asiatic Squadron, &quot;feared at first that she had been destroyed by the Spanish, which of course meant war, and I was getting ready for it when a later dispatch said it was an accident.&quot; Navy captain Philip R. Alger, an expert on ordnance and explosives, posted a bulletin at the Navy Department the next day communicating that the explosion had been caused by a spontaneous fire in the coal bunkers. Assistant Navy secretary Theodore Roosevelt wrote a letter protesting this statement, which he viewed as premature. Roosevelt argued that Alger should not have commented on an ongoing investigation, saying, &quot;Mr. Alger cannot possibly know anything about the accident. All the best men in the Department agree that, whether probable or not, it certainly is possible that the ship was blown up by a mine.&quot;

=== Yellow journalism ===
The &quot;New York Journal&quot; and &quot;New York World&quot;, owned respectively by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, sensationalized the &quot;Maine&quot; incident with intense press coverage, employing tactics that would later be labeled &quot;yellow journalism&quot;. Both newspapers exaggerated and distorted much of the information they obtained, sometimes even fabricating news to fit their agendas. For a week following the sinking, the &quot;Journal&quot; devoted a daily average of eight and a half pages of news, editorials and pictures to the event. Its editors sent a full team of reporters and artists to Havana, including Frederic Remington, and Hearst announced a reward of $50,000 &quot;for the conviction of the criminals who sent 258 American sailors to their deaths.&quot;

The &quot;World,&quot; while overall not as lurid or shrill in tone as the &quot;Journal,&quot; nevertheless indulged in similar theatrics, insisting continuously that &quot;Maine&quot; had been bombed or mined. Privately, Pulitzer felt that &quot;nobody outside a lunatic asylum&quot; really believed that Spain sanctioned &quot;Maine&quot;″s destruction. However, his &quot;New York&quot; &quot;World&quot; insisted that the only &quot;atonement&quot; that Spain could offer the U.S. for the loss of ship and life was the granting of complete Cuban independence. The paper accused Spain of &quot;treachery, willingness, or laxness&quot; for failing to ensure the safety of Havana Harbor. Many members of the American public, already agitated over reported Spanish atrocities in Cuba, were driven to increased hysteria.

Hearst&#x27;s reporting on the &quot;Maine&quot; incident generated support for military action against the Spanish in Cuba regardless of their actual involvement in the sinking. He frequently cited various naval officers saying that the explosion could not have been an on-board accident. He quoted an &quot;officer high in authority&quot; as saying: &quot;The idea that the catastrophe resulted from an internal accident is preposterous. In the first place, such a thing has never occurred before that I have ever heard of either in the British navy or ours.&quot;

=== Spanish–American War ===


&quot;Maine&quot;″s destruction did not result in an immediate declaration of war with Spain, but the event created an atmosphere that endangered a peaceful solution. The Spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers, but the Sampson Board ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo.

The episode focused national attention on the crisis in Cuba. The McKinley administration did not cite the explosion as a &quot;casus belli&quot;, but others were already inclined to wage war with Spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in Cuba. Advocates of war used the rallying cry, &quot;Remember the &quot;Maine!&quot; To hell with Spain!&quot; The Spanish–American War began on 21 April 1898, two months after the sinking.

== Investigations ==
In addition to the inquiry commissioned by the Spanish government to naval officers Del Peral and De Salas, two naval courts of inquiry were ordered: the Sampson Board in 1898 and the Vreeland board in 1911. In 1976, Admiral Hyman G. Rickover commissioned a private investigation, and the National Geographic Society investigated in 1998, using computer simulations. All investigations agreed that an explosion of the forward magazines caused the destruction of the ship, but different conclusions were reached regarding the exact cause of the explosion.

=== 1898 Del Peral and De Salas inquiry ===
The Spanish inquiry, conducted by Del Peral and De Salas, collected evidence from officers of naval artillery, who had examined the remains of the &quot;Maine&quot;. Del Peral and De Salas identified the spontaneous combustion of the coal bunker, located adjacent to the munition stores in &quot;Maine&quot;, as the likely cause of the explosion. The possibility that other combustibles, such as varnish, drier or alcohol products, had caused the explosion was not discounted. Additional observations included that:
* Had a mine been the cause of the explosion, a column of water would have been observed.
* The wind and the waters were calm and hence a mine could have only been detonated by electricity, but no cables had been found.
* No dead fish were found in the harbor, as would be expected following an explosion in the water.
* Munition stores do not usually explode when a ship is sunk by a mine.
The conclusions of the report were not reported at the time by the American press.

=== 1898 Sampson Board&#x27;s Court of Inquiry ===
A naval inquiry was ordered by the United States shortly after the incident, headed by Captain William T. Sampson. Ramón Blanco y Erenas, Spanish governor of Cuba, had instead proposed a joint Spanish-American investigation. Captain Sigsbee had written that &quot;many Spanish officers, including representatives of General Blanco, now with us to express sympathy.&quot; In a cable, the Spanish minister of colonies Segismundo Moret had advised Blanco &quot;to gather every fact you can, to prove the &quot;Maine&quot; catastrophe cannot be attributed to us.&quot;

According to Dana Wegner, who worked with Rickover on his 1974 investigation of the sinking, the Secretary of the Navy had the option of personally selecting a board of inquiry. Instead, he resorted to protocol and assigned the commander-in-chief of the North Atlantic squadron to do so. The commander produced a list of junior line officers for the board. The fact that the officer proposed to be court president was junior to the captain of &quot;Maine&quot;, Wegner writes, &quot;would indicate either ignorance of navy regulations or that, in the beginning, the board did not intend to examine the possibility that the ship was lost by accident and the negligence of her captain.&quot; Eventually, navy regulations prevailed in leadership of the board, Captain Sampson being senior to Captain Sigsbee.

The board arrived on 21 February and took testimony from survivors, witnesses and divers who investigated the wreck underwater. The Sampson Board produced its findings in two parts: the proceedings, which consisted mainly of testimonies, and the findings, which were the facts as determined by the court. Between the proceedings and the findings, there was what Wegner calls &quot;a broad gap&quot; in which the court &quot;left no record of the reasoning that carried it from the often-inconsistent witnesses to [its] conclusion.&quot; Another inconsistency, according to Wegner, was that the board summoned only one technical witness, Commander George Converse, from the Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island. Captain Sampson read Commander Converse a hypothetical situation of a coal-bunker fire igniting the reserve six-inch ammunition, with a resulting explosion sinking the ship. He then asked Commander Converse about the feasibility of such a scenario. Commander Converse &quot;simply stated, without elaboration, that he could not realize such an event happening.&quot;

The board concluded that &quot;Maine&quot; had been destroyed by a mine, which, in turn, caused the explosion of her forward magazines. They reached this conclusion based on the fact that the majority of witnesses stated that they had heard two explosions and that part of the keel was bent inward. The official report from the board, which was presented to the Navy Department in Washington on 21 March, specifically stated the following:

=== 1911 Vreeland Board&#x27;s Court of Inquiry ===
In 1910, the decision was made to conduct a second court of inquiry. Doing so would also facilitate the recovery of bodies so they could be buried in the United States. The fact that the Cuban government wanted the wreck removed from Havana Harbor might also have played a role; it at least offered the opportunity to examine the wreck in greater detail than had been possible in 1898, while simultaneously obliging the newly independent Cubans. Wegner suggests that the fact that this inquiry could be held without the threat of war, which had been the case in 1898, lent it the potential for greater objectivity than had been possible previously. Moreover, as several of the members of the 1910 board would be certified engineers, they would be better qualified to evaluate their findings than had been the line officers of the 1898 board.

Beginning in December 1910, a cofferdam was built around the wreck and water was removed, exposing the wreck by late 1911. Between 20 November and 2 December 1911, a court of inquiry headed by Rear Admiral Charles E. Vreeland inspected the wreck. They concluded that an external explosion had triggered the explosion of the magazines. This explosion was farther aft and lower-powered than had been concluded by the Sampson Board. The Vreeland Board also found that the bending of frame 18 was caused by the explosion of the magazines, not by the external explosion. After the investigation, the newly located dead were buried in Arlington National Cemetery and the hollow, intact portion of the hull of &quot;Maine&quot; was refloated and ceremoniously scuttled at sea on 16 March 1912.

=== 1974 Rickover investigation ===
Rickover became intrigued with the disaster and began a private investigation in 1974, using information from the two official inquiries, newspapers, personal papers, and information on the construction and ammunition of &quot;Maine&quot;. He concluded that the explosion was not caused by a mine, and speculated that spontaneous combustion was the most likely cause, from coal in the bunker next to the magazine. He published a book about this investigation in 1976 entitled &quot;How the Battleship &quot;Maine&quot; Was Destroyed&quot;.

In the 2001 book &quot;Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. Navy and the Spanish–American War&quot;, Wegner revisits the Rickover investigation and offers additional details. According to Wegner, Rickover interviewed naval historians at the Energy Research and Development Agency after reading an article in the &quot;Washington Star-News&quot; by John M. Taylor. The author claimed that the U.S. Navy &quot;made little use of its technically trained officers during its investigation of the tragedy.&quot; The historians were working with Rickover on a study of the Navy&#x27;s nuclear propulsion program, but they said that they knew no details of &quot;Maine&quot;″s sinking. Rickover asked whether they could investigate the matter, and they agreed. Wegner says that all relevant documents were obtained and studied, including the ship&#x27;s plans and weekly reports of the unwatering of &quot;Maine&quot; in 1912 (the progress of the cofferdam) written by William Furgueson, chief engineer for the project. These reports included numerous photos annotated by Furgueson with frame and strake numbers on corresponding parts of the wreckage. Two experts were brought in to analyze the naval demolitions and ship explosions. They concluded that the photos showed &quot;no plausible evidence of penetration from the outside,&quot; and they believed that the explosion originated inside the ship.

Wegner suggests that a combination of naval ship design and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of the &quot;Maine&quot;″s building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers, and American naval ships burned smokeless anthracite coal. With an increase in the number of steel ships, the Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal and allowed ships to steam faster. Wegner explains that anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, but bituminous coal is considerably more volatile and is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal: iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors, the first involving oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally experienced spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, which exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, meaning &quot;fire&quot;, as they can cause sparks when struck by steel or other hard surfaces. Pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in wheellock guns, for example. The pyrites could have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had been reported aboard warships before the &quot;Maine&quot;″s explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study that concluded that a coal bunker fire could have taken place and ignited the ship&#x27;s ammunition.

=== 1998 &quot;National Geographic&quot; investigation ===
In 1998, &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine commissioned an analysis by Advanced Marine Enterprises (AME). This investigation, done to commemorate the centennial of the sinking of USS &quot;Maine&quot;, was based on computer modeling, a technique unavailable for previous investigations. The results reached were inconclusive. &quot;National Geographic&quot; reported that &quot;a fire in the coal bunker could have generated sufficient heat to touch off an explosion in the adjacent magazine [but] on the other hand, computer analysis also shows that even a small, handmade mine could have penetrated the ship&#x27;s hull and set off explosions within.&quot; The AME investigation noted that &quot;the size and location of the soil depression beneath the &quot;Maine&quot; &#x27;is more readily explained by a mine explosion than by magazine explosions alone&#x27;.&quot; The team noted that this was not &quot;definitive in proving that a mine was the cause of the sinking&quot; but it did &quot;strengthen the case.&quot;

Some experts, including Rickover&#x27;s team and several analysts at AME, do not agree with the conclusion. Wegner claims that technical opinion among the &quot;Geographic&quot; team was divided between its younger members, who focused on computer modeling results, and its older ones, who weighed their inspection of photos of the wreck with their own experience. He adds that AME used flawed data concerning the &quot;Maine&quot;″s design and ammunition storage. Wegner was also critical of the fact that participants in the Rickover study were not consulted until AME&#x27;s analysis was essentially complete, far too late to confirm the veracity of data being used or engage in any other meaningful cooperation.

=== 2002 Discovery Channel &quot;Unsolved History&quot; investigation ===
In 2002, the Discovery Channel produced an episode of the &quot;Unsolved History&quot; documentaries, entitled &quot;Death of the U.S.S. &quot;Maine&quot;&quot;. It used photographic evidence, naval experts, and archival information to argue that the cause of the explosion was a coal bunker fire, and it identified a weakness or gap in the bulkhead separating the coal and powder bunkers that allowed the fire to spread from the former to the latter.

=== False flag operation conspiracy theories ===
Several claims have been made in Spanish-speaking media that the sinking was a false flag operation conducted by the U.S. and those claims are the official view in Cuba. The &quot;Maine&quot; monument in Havana describes &quot;Maine&quot;″s sailors as &quot;victims sacrificed to the imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of Cuba&quot; and claims that American agents deliberately blew up their own ship.

Eliades Acosta was the head of the Cuban Communist Party&#x27;s Committee on Culture and a former director of the José Martí National Library in Havana. He offered the standard Cuban interpretation in an interview to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but he adds that &quot;Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, and that should be recognized.&quot; This claim has also been made in Russia by Mikhail Khazin, a Russian economist who once ran the cultural section at &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot;, and in Spain by Eric Frattini, a Spanish Peruvian journalist in his book &quot;Manipulando la historia. Operaciones de Falsa Bandera. Del Maine al Golpe de estado de Turquía&quot;.

Operation Northwoods was a series of proposals prepared by Pentagon officials for the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962, setting out a number of proposed false flag operations that could be blamed on the Cuban Communists in order to rally support against them. One of these suggested that a U.S. Navy ship be blown up in Guantanamo Bay deliberately. In an echo of the yellow press headlines of the earlier period, it used the phrase &quot;A &#x27;Remember the &quot;Maine&quot;&#x27; incident&quot;.

== Raising and final sinking ==
For several years, the &quot;Maine&quot; was left where she sank in Havana harbor, but it was evident she would have to be removed sometime. It took up valuable space in the harbor, and the buildup of silt around her hull threatened to create a shoal. In addition, various patriotic groups wanted mementos of the ship. On 9 May 1910, Congress authorized funds for the removal of the &quot;Maine&quot;, the proper interment in Arlington National Cemetery of the estimated 70 bodies still inside, and the removal and transport of the main mast to Arlington. Congress did not demand a new investigation into the sinking at that time.

The Army Corps of Engineers built a cofferdam around the &quot;Maine&quot; and pumped water out from inside it. By 30 June 1911, the &quot;Maine&quot;″s main deck was exposed, revealing just how damaged the ship was: Forward of frame 41 was completely destroyed, leaving only a twisted mass of steel that bore no resemblance to a bow, and the rest of the wreck was severely corroded. When the water was fully drained, army engineers used oxyacetylene torches to cut away the damaged superstructure and decks. Then, midway through the wreck, they cut away what was left of the forward portion of the ship and built a concrete and wooden bulkhead to seal the after-section. Holes were cut in the bottom of the after-section, through which jets of water were pumped, to break the mud seal holding the ship, then plugged, with flood cocks, which would later be used for sinking the ship. The &quot;Maine&quot; had been outfitted with Worthington steam pumps. After lying on the bottom of Havana harbor for fourteen years these pumps were found to be still operational; they were subsequently cleaned and used by the Army Corps of Engineers to aid them in their work on the wreck.

During the salvage, the remains of 66 men were found, of whom only one, Harry J. Keys (an engineering officer), was identified and returned to his home town; the rest were reburied at Arlington National Cemetery, making a total of 229 &quot;Maine&quot; crew buried there. All recovered bodies were removed to the armored cruiser for repatriation. Finally, on 13 February 1912, the engineers let water back into the interior of the cofferdam. Three days later, the interior of the cofferdam was full and the extant after-section of the &quot;Maine&quot; was refloated. Two days after that, the &quot;Maine&quot; was towed out by the tug On 16 March, the &quot;Maine&quot; was towed four miles from the Cuban coast by &quot;Osceola&quot;, escorted by &quot;North Carolina&quot; and the light cruiser . She was loaded with dynamite as a possible aid to her sinking. Flowers adorned &quot;Maine&quot;&#x27;s deck, and an American flag was strung from her jury mast. At 5pm local time, with a crowd of over 100,000 persons watching from the shore, her sea cocks were opened, and just over twenty minutes later, &quot;Maine&quot; sank, bow first, in of water, to the sound of Taps and a twenty-one gun salute, courtesy of the men on the &quot;Birmingham&quot; and &quot;North Carolina&quot;.

== Rediscovery ==

On 18 October 2000, the wreck of &quot;Maine&quot; was rediscovered in about 3,770 feet (1,150 m) of water roughly 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of Havana Harbor by Advanced Digital Communications, a Toronto-based expedition company. The team, led by marine engineer Paulina Zelitsky, accidentally stumbled across the ship while working with Cuban scientists and oceanographers from the University of South Florida College of Marine Science to test underwater exploration technology. The researchers, who referred to the wreck as the &quot;square&quot; due to its unique shape, did not initially believe it to be the &quot;Maine&quot;, since the ship was discovered east of where it was reportedly scuttled. (This displacement was likely due to currents pushing the ship as it sank.) Once the team began to explore the wreck with a Remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), they discovered that the hull had not overly oxidized, allowing them to &quot;see all of [the ship&#x27;s] structural parts.&quot; The researchers confirmed the ship&#x27;s identity both by scrutinizing the design of its doors, hatches, anchor chain, and propellers, and by identifying the telltale bulkhead that had been created when the bow was removed in 1912. Near the wreck, the team also located a boiler and a debris field of coal.

== Memorials ==

=== Arlington, Annapolis, Havana, Key West ===

In February 1898, the recovered bodies of sailors who died on &quot;Maine&quot; were interred in the Colon Cemetery, Havana. Some injured sailors were sent to hospitals in Havana and Key West, Florida. Those who died in hospitals were buried in Key West. In December 1899, the bodies in Havana were disinterred and brought back to the United States for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. In 1915, President Woodrow Wilson dedicated the USS &quot;Maine&quot; Mast Memorial to those who died. The memorial includes the ship&#x27;s main mast. Roughly 165 were buried at Arlington, although the remains of one sailor were exhumed for his home town, Indianapolis, Indiana. Of the rest, only 62 were known. Nine bodies were never recovered and 19 crewmen, several unidentified, are buried in Key West Cemetery under a statue of a U.S. sailor holding an oar.

The explosion-bent fore mast of &quot;Maine&quot; is located at the United States Naval Academy.

In 1926, the Cuban government erected a memorial to the victims of &quot;Maine&quot; on the Malecon, near the Hotel Nacional, to commemorate United States assistance in acquiring Cuban independence from Spain. The monument features two of &quot;Maine&quot;″s four 10-inch guns. In 1961, the memorial was damaged by crowds, following the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the eagle on top was broken and removed. The Communist government then added its own inscription blaming &quot;imperialist voracity in its eagerness to seize the island of Cuba&quot; for &quot;Maine&quot;″s sinking. The monument was cleaned and restored in 2013. The eagle&#x27;s head was retained by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, and the body by the city&#x27;s museum.

<text>The Battle of Bir Hakeim () took place at Bir Hakeim, an oasis in the Libyan desert south and west of Tobruk, during the Battle of Gazala (26 May – 21 June 1942). The 1st Free French Brigade under Marie-Pierre Kœnig defended the position from against Axis forces of &quot;Panzerarmee Afrika&quot; commanded by Erwin Rommel. The captured Tobruk ten days later.

The delay imposed on the Axis offensive by the defence of Bir Hakeim influenced the cancellation of Operation Herkules, the Axis invasion of Malta. Rommel invaded Egypt, slowed by British delaying actions until the First Battle of El Alamein in July, where the Axis advance was stopped. Both sides used the battle for propaganda, Winston Churchill declared the Free French to be the &quot;Fighting French&quot;.

==Background==

===Eighth Army===
At the beginning of 1942, after its defeat in western Cyrenaica during , the British Eighth Army under Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie faced the Axis troops in Libya roughly west of the port of Tobruk, along a line running from the coast at Gazala, southwards for about . Both sides accumulated supplies for an offensive to forestall their opponent and General Claude Auchinleck, Commander in Chief of Middle East Command, hoped for the Eighth Army to be ready by May. British code-breakers tracked the dispatch of convoys to Libya as the British offensive on Axis shipping to North Africa was neutralised by Axis bombing of Malta and forecast that the Axis would attack first.

As the Eighth Army was not ready to take the offensive, Ritchie planned to fight a defensive battle on the Gazala line. Auchinleck&#x27;s appreciation of the situation to Ritchie in mid-May expected either a frontal attack in the centre of the Gazala line, followed by an advance on Tobruk or a flanking move to the south, looping around the Gazala line towards Tobruk. Auchinleck saw the former as more likely (with a feint on the flank to draw away the Eighth Army tanks) while Ritchie favoured the latter. Auchinleck suggested that British armour be concentrated near El Adem, where it would be well placed to meet either threat.

Since Operation Crusader in late 1941, the Eighth Army had received American M3 Grant medium tanks with a in a turret and a in a hull sponson, which could penetrate the armour of the opposing and &quot;J&quot; and the tank models at . The frontal armour of the Grant was thick enough to withstand the 50 mm Pak 38 anti-tank gun at and the short-barrelled 50 mm KwK 38 gun of the at . The first 112 of the new British 6-pounder (57 mm) anti-tank guns had arrived and been allotted to the motor brigades of the armoured divisions.


At the meeting of Axis leaders at Berchtesgaden on 1 May, it was agreed that Rommel should attack at the end of the month to capture Tobruk. The Panzer Army Africa (/) was to pause at the Egyptian border, while the Axis captured Malta in Operation Herkules and then Rommel was to invade Egypt. The had finished converting to the up-armoured and had , known to the British as Mark III Specials, with long-barrelled 5 cm KwK 39 guns. Four (Mark IV Specials) with long-barrelled 7.5 cm KwK 40 guns had also arrived. (German military intelligence) had broken British codes and in late 1941 penetrated Black, the code used by Bonner Fellers, a US military attaché in Egypt. The British divulged much tactical information to Fellers, who unwittingly reported it to the Axis as well as the US government.

Air attacks by the and on Malta reduced its offensive capacity and supply convoys from Italy reached the Axis forces in Africa with fewer losses. Until May, Axis monthly deliveries to Libya averaged , less than a smaller Axis force received from June to October 1941 but sufficient for an offensive. The advance to Gazala succeeded because the port of Benghazi was open, reducing the transport distance for about of the supplies of the to . The capture of Malta would not alter the constraints of port capacity and distance; protecting convoys and the use of a large port close to the front would still be necessary.

 (Operation Venice), the Axis plan, was for tanks to advance around the brigade forming the Bir Hakeim &quot;box&quot; at the southern extremity of the Gazala line. On the left side of the manoeuvre, the Italian 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; would neutralise the Bir Hakeim box. Further south, the 21st Panzer Division and 15th Panzer Division would advance through the desert, move east, then turn north behind the Gazala line to destroy the British armour and cut off the infantry divisions in the line. The most southerly part of the attacking formation, a (battle group) of the 90th Light &quot;Afrika&quot; Division (, Ulrich Kleemann), was to advance to El Adem south of Tobruk, cut the supply routes from the port to the Gazala line and hold British troops at Tobruk by a ruse; aircraft-engines mounted on trucks were to raise dust, simulating the presence of a big armoured force. The Germans had combed the French Foreign Legion in French North Africa and press-ganged some 2,000 German into the 90th Light &quot;Afrika&quot; Division.

The rest of the Italian XX Motorised Corps, the 101st Motorized Division &quot;Trieste&quot;, would gap the minefield north of Bir Hakeim, near the Sidi Muftah box, to create a supply route to the panzers. Rommel anticipated that having dealt with the British tanks, he would have captured El Adem, Ed Duda and Sidi Rezegh by nightfall and later the Knightsbridge defensive box, about north-east of Bir Hakeim. The Axis tanks would be in a position next day to thrust westwards against the Eighth Army defensive boxes between Gazala and Alem Hamza, meeting the eastwards attack by the Italian X Corps and XXI corps. By late May, the Axis forces comprised and 

==Prelude==

===Gazala line===
Between Gazala and Timimi (just west of Tobruk), the Eighth Army was able to concentrate its forces sufficiently to turn and fight. By 4 February, the Axis advance had been halted and the front line had been stabilised, from Gazala on the coast west of Tobruk, to the old Ottoman fortress of Bir Hakeim, to the south. The Gazala line was a series of defensive boxes accommodating a brigade each, laid out across the desert behind minefields and wire, watched by regular patrols between the boxes. The Free French were in the south at the Bir Hakeim box, south of the 150th Infantry Brigade box, which was south of the 69th Infantry Brigade box. The line was not evenly manned, with a greater number of troops covering the coast road, leaving the south less protected but deep minefields had been laid in front of the boxes.

The longer line made an attack around the southern flank harder to supply. Behind the Gazala line were the Commonwealth Keep, Acroma, Knightsbridge and El Adem boxes, sited to block tracks and junctions. The box at Retma was finished just before the Axis offensive but work on the Point 171 and Bir el Gubi boxes did not begin until 25 May. By late May, the 1st South African Division was dug in nearest the coast, with the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division to the south and 1st Free French Brigade furthest left at Bir Hakeim. The British 1st and 7th Armoured divisions waited behind the main line as a mobile counter-attack force, the 2nd South African Division garrisoned Tobruk and 5th Indian Infantry Division was in reserve. The British had and 

===Bir Hakeim===
The fortress at Bir Hakeim (Old Man&#x27;s Well) had been built by the Ottomans and later used as a station by the Italian (Camel Corps) to control movement at the crossroads of two Bedouin paths. The wells had long been dry and had been abandoned but Indian troops re-occupied the site to build a strongpoint surrounded by The fortification was a rough pentagon pointing north, about wide. On 14 February, the 150th Infantry Brigade was relieved at the box by the 1st Free French Brigade ( Marie Pierre Kœnig), part of XXX Corps (Lieutenant-General Willoughby Norrie). With a fighting strength of 3,000 men and a rear echelon of about 600 men based to the east behind the line, the brigade comprised the 13th &quot;Demi-Brigade&quot; of the Foreign Legion (13e DBLE), an established unit and the backbone of the Free French, with the 2nd Colonial Demi-Brigade.

The 13e DBLE had been formed to fight in Finland but was used in the Norwegian campaign and was the first unit to join the Free French in England. It was a veteran of the fighting in Italian Eritrea and French Syria against Vichy; the half-brigade was reinforced by and two officers of the defeated 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment (6e REI), which now formed a third battalion. By mid-May the perimeter and central areas were honeycombed with foxholes, gun emplacements and underground bunkers, deep camouflaged hides for vehicles and supply dumps. The interior of the fort was divided into zones, each the responsibility of a unit, with Kœnig&#x27;s headquarters near the centre, at the crossroads. The V-shaped anti-tank and anti-personnel minefields were patrolled by the 3rd Foreign Legion Battalion (Lamaze), in 63 Bren Gun Carriers divided into three squadrons. The patrols moved along lanes in the minefields, paying particular attention to the area north to the Sidi Muftah box at Got el Ualeb, held by the 150th Brigade.

===Battle of Gazala===


At on 26 May, the Italian X and XXI Corps began a frontal attack on the central Gazala line. A few elements of the and the Italian XX Motorised Corps participated and during the day the bulk of the moved north, to give the impression that it was the main attack. After dark, the armoured formations turned south in a sweeping move around the southern end of the Gazala line. Early on 27 May, the main force of , the , XX Motorised Corps and the 90th Light Division, went round the southern end of the Gazala line, using the British minefields to protect the Axis flank and rear. The &quot;Ariete&quot; Division was held up for about an hour by the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade (7th Armoured Division), dug in about south-east of Bir Hakeim.

The 15th Panzer Division engaged the 4th Armoured Brigade, which had come south to support the 3rd Indian and 7th Motorised brigades. The Germans were surprised by the range and power of the on the new M3 Grants but by late morning, the 4th Armoured Brigade had withdrawn toward El Adem and Axis armoured units had advanced more than north. Their advance was stopped around noon by the 1st Armoured Division, in mutually-costly fighting. On the right, the 90th Light Division forced the 7th Motorised Brigade out of Retma eastwards on Bir el Gubi. Advancing toward El Adem at mid-morning, armoured cars of the 90th Light Division overran and scattered the advanced HQ of the 7th Armoured Division (Major-General Frank Messervy), near Bir Beuid. Messervy was captured and removed his insignia, persuading the Germans that he was a batman; he escaped with several other men to rejoin the division. The 90th Light Division reached the El Adem area by mid-morning and captured several supply bases. The following day, the 4th Armoured Brigade moved on El Adem and forced the 90th Light Division to retire to the south-west.

==Siege==

===27 May===
Baldassarre&#x27;s XX Corps was to attack the Bir Hakeim box to prevent the French Brigade interfering to the main attack together with the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; (&quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Walter Nehring). The 15th and 21st Panzer divisions, the rest of the 90th Light Division and the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division began their large encircling move south of Bir Hakeim as planned. While some german tanks were in the area at the start of the battle none participated as they were ordered to go south by Rommel. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade was surprised at on 27 May and overrun at Point 171, south-east of Bir Hakeim, by the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment of the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division, losing about and most of its equipment. The 7th Motor Brigade was then attacked at Retma and forced back to Bir el Gubi. The 4th Armoured Brigade advanced in support and collided with the 15th Panzer Division; the 8th Hussars were destroyed and the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment (3rd RTR) lost many tanks. The British inflicted considerable losses in return but then retired to El Adem.

After over-running the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, the VIII Tank Battalion M13/40, IX Tank Battalion M13/40 and X Tank Battalion M13/40 of the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment moved to the north-east of Bir Hakeim and the IX Battalion (Colonel Prestisimone) with 60 tanks, changed direction towards the fort. The IX Battalion arrived before the Bir Hakeim minefield and barbed wire at charged and lost and a self-propelled gun. Ten tanks got through the minefield and were knocked out by guns, causing casualties. The remnants of the IX Battalion retired to the main body of the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division, which moved north towards Bir el Harmat around noon, following Rommel&#x27;s original plan.

===28–30 May===
On 28 May, the Desert Air Force (DAF) made a maximum effort to attack Axis columns around El Adem and Bir Hakeim but in the poor visibility, bombed Bir Hakeim and its surroundings, misled by the Italian tank wrecks around the position and Kœnig sent a detachment to destroy the wrecks to avoid any more mistakes. A French column was sent to make contact with the 150th Infantry Brigade, stationed further to the north. After a few hours, Italian artillery forced them to retire but the French column destroyed seven half-tracks. On 29 May, the detachment of Gabriel de Sairigné destroyed three German tanks, British air attacks intercepted two raids by Junkers Ju 87 () dive-bombers and fighter-bombers attacked Axis supply lines south and east of Bir Hakeim. On 30 May, from the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, captured by the Axis and then released in the desert, reached the fort and added to the already there, making the water shortage worse. The detachment of Lamaze, at the request of the 7th Armoured Division, sealed off the breach opened the day before by the Axis tanks in the minefields. Led by Colonel Dimitri Amilakhvari, the legionnaires were ambushed but managed to retreat with the help of the Bren carriers of the 9th Company ().

===31 May–1 June===

On 31 May, during a two-day sandstorm, fifty supply trucks of the 101st Transport Company ( Dulau), reached Bir Hakeim with water and took the Indians, prisoners and seriously wounded back to the British lines. A raid by the detachments , and , led by Amilakhvari, destroyed five tanks and an armoured vehicle repair workshop. The had been forced to retreat westwards, to an area north of Bir Hakeim, which became known as the Cauldron, having attacked the 150th Infantry Brigade box since 28 May. During the day, the DAF lost fifteen fighters and a bomber, combat with Axis fighters and one to flak, the worst daily loss of the battle; the lost nine aircraft. On the west side of the Cauldron, the 150th Infantry Brigade was overrun late on 1 June, despite British relief attempts. The Axis troops that had been trapped gained a supply route through the Eighth Army minefields north of Bir Hakeim and next morning the encirclement of the fort was resumed by the 90th Light Division, &quot;Trieste&quot; Division and three armoured reconnaissance companies from the 17th Infantry Division &quot;Pavia&quot;. At German troops approached from the south and Italian forces advanced from the north. Two Italian officers presented themselves at to the 2nd Foreign Legion Battalion lines, asking for the capitulation of the fort, which Kœnig refused.

===2–4 June===
From on 2 June, both sides exchanged artillery fire but the French field guns were out-ranged by German medium artillery and the fort was bombed by German and Italian aircraft. dive bombers raided Bir Hakeim more than twenty times but the French positions were so well built as to be almost invulnerable. The British were unable to reinforce the French, who repulsed the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division attack but on 2 June, the DAF had an easily observed bomb line around the fort and concentrated on the area with fighter patrols and fighter-bomber attacks. The sight of scores of burning vehicles helped to maintain the morale of the defenders, who harassed Axis communications around the fort, as did the 7th Motor Brigade and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade which were in the vicinity. On 4 June, DAF fighters and fighter-bombers disrupted Stuka attacks and bombed Axis vehicles, blowing up an ammunition wagon in view of the French but losing seven aircraft. Kœnig signalled Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Coningham. &quot; which brought the reply &quot;.

===5–7 June===

From 5 to 6 June, the DAF flew fewer sorties at Bir Hakeim, concentrating on the Knightsbridge Box and around on 6 June, the 90th Light Division attacked with the support of pioneers to try to clear a passage through the minefield. The pioneers got within of the fort, having breached the outer minefield and during the night they managed to clear several passages into the inner perimeter. German infantry gained a foothold but the French troops in foxholes, dug outs and blockhouses, maintained a great volume of small-arms fire, which forced the Germans under cover. Operation Aberdeen, an attempt to destroy Axis forces in the Cauldron, which had begun on the night of was a . Ritchie considered withdrawing the French from the fort to release the 7th Motor Brigade but decided to keep possession and on 7 June, four DAF raids were made against the Germans in the minefields. That night, a last convoy approached the fort and Bellec got through the German lines, in thick fog, to guide the convoy in. The Germans used the fog to prepare a final assault; tanks, 88 mm guns and the pioneers of formed up in front of the fort.

===8–9 June===

On the morning of 8 June, after the defeat of Operation Aberdeen, Rommel had released part of the 15th Panzer Division and for the siege. Rommel commanded an attack from the north, approaching as close as possible in thick fog, with artillery firing directly against the fortifications. The made constant attacks, including a raid by &quot;Stukas&quot;, three ten Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin-engined fighters escorted by Just before the attack began, aiming at a low rise which would overlook the French defences. The Chadian and Congolese defenders held on despite many casualties and in the afternoon another 60 bombed the perimeter and an attack was made all round the northern defences. An ammunition dump was blown up and the perimeter forced back. Kœnig reported that the garrison was exhausted, had suffered many casualties and was down to its reserve supplies; he asked for more air support and a relief operation. The DAF made another maximum effort, flew a record and during the night, Hawker Hurricane fighters and Douglas Boston bombers dropped supplies to the garrison. The DAF lost eight fighters (three to Italian Macchi C.202s) and two bombers; the lost two aircraft and the one.

On the morning of 9 June, 20 40 escorted by 50 Bf 110 and Bf 109 fighters, attacked Bir Hakeim. The Germans waited for the rest of the 15th Panzer Division to arrive as German artillery and aircraft bombarded the fort, then a two-pronged attack struck the perimeter. Italian infantry fought alongside , the German and Libyan infantry of (Special Commando 288) from the 90th Light Division, elements of the reconnaissance and infantry units of 15th and 21st Panzer Divisions and a company of 11 tanks. The objective was Point 186, the top of a gentle rise in the ground which acted as a fire-control position for the garrison. A few skirmishes occurred between the 66th Infantry Regiment &quot;Trieste&quot; of the &quot;Trieste&quot; Division and the men commanded by Lieutenant Bourgoin, whose unit was down only to hand grenades. The made a determined defence but was forced back, despite reinforcements of the 22nd North African Company.

In the afternoon, to the south, near the old fort, Ernst-Günther Baade led two battalions of Rifle Regiment 115 into the assault and in a costly advance, it established a position of the fort by nightfall. At as bombed the north face of the fort, the German infantry and the 15th Panzer Division attacked behind an artillery barrage. The attackers breached the 9th Company lines and the central position of Morvan but the situation was restored with a Bren carrier counter-attack. Many DAF aircraft were unserviceable and the effort for the day was much reduced but two Hurricanes dropped medical supplies; diversions attempted by columns from the 7th Motor Brigade and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade were too small to have much effect. In the afternoon Messervy, the commander of the 7th Armoured Division, signalled that a break-out might be necessary and Kœnig asked for DAF protection for an evacuation at that night. The request was made at too short notice and the garrison had to wait until the night of 10/11 June for a rendezvous to be arranged by the British to the south.

===Retreat, 10–11 June===
During 10 June, the French hung on and suffered many casualties; with only two hundred and rounds left, another attack on the northern sector against the Oubangui-Chari and 3rd Foreign Legion Battalion lines was contained by a counter-attack by the Messmer and Lamaze units, supported by Bren carriers and the last mortar rounds. In the afternoon, the biggest air attack of the siege, a raid by 100 dropped of bombs. The last rounds of ammunition were issued and bodies searched for more; Rommel predicted that Bir Hakeim would fall the next day but resisted pressure to attack with tanks, fearing that many would be lost in the minefields.

As darkness fell, sappers began to clear mines from the western face of the fortress, heavy equipment was prepared for demolition and two companies were detailed to stay behind to disguise the retirement. A rendezvous was arranged with the 7th Motor Brigade, which ran a convoy of lorries and ambulances to a point south of the fort. Mine clearance by the sappers took longer than expected and they were only able to clear a narrow passage, rather than a corridor. Vehicles went astray and the ambulances and walking-wounded left the perimeter late at Kœnig put the fort under the command of Amilakhvari, the Foreign Legion commander and left the fort at the head of the column in his Ford, driven by Susan Travers, an Englishwoman, the only female member of French Foreign Legion (and one of several women, mostly British, present at the siege).

A flare rose and the Axis troops nearby opened fire. The guide of the HQ column got lost and during the retirement was blown up three times by mines. When Kœnig caught up with the main column, it was blocked by troops of the 90th Light Division and he ordered a rush, regardless of the mines; Lamaze, Charles Bricogne and Lieutenant Dewey were killed in the . The reception was organised by Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) which drove lorries and guided extra field ambulances, with inexperienced rear-area crews, escorted by the 2nd King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) and the 2nd Rifle Brigade on either side. The ambulances became separated in the dark but were found and guided to the rendezvous. The commander of the 3rd Battalion was captured but most of the brigade managed to break out, reach Bir el Gubi, then withdraw to Gasr-el-Arid by on 11 June. About of the original escaped, including during the day British patrols picked up stragglers.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The Free French occupation of Bir Hakeim had lengthened the Axis supply route around the south end of the Gazala line, caused them losses and gave the British more time to recover in the wake of their defeat at the Cauldron. From 2 to 10 June the DAF had flown about and lost over the fort, against about sorties in which and five Italian aircraft were shot down; the 7th Motor Brigade ran four supply convoys into Bir Hakeim from 31 May to 7 June. Free French morale was raised by its performance in the battle; a victory had been badly needed to show the Allies that they were a serious force, which could contribute to the war against Germany. The term Free French was replaced by &quot;Fighting French&quot;, because the battle had shown the world that a revival after the defeat in 1940 was under way; De Gaulle used it to undermine co-operation with the Vichy regime. In 1960, the British official historian Ian Playfair wrote

and Auchinleck said on 12 June 1942, &quot;The United Nations need to be filled with admiration and gratitude in respect of these French troops and their brave General Kœnig&quot;. After the war, Friedrich von Mellenthin wrote, &quot;Some British officers have insinuated that French morale gave way but in the whole course of the desert war, we never encountered a more heroic and well-sustained defence&quot;.

===Casualties===

Thomas Buell in 2002 and Ken Ford in 2008 wrote of dead, and taken prisoner, with the loss of and 50 vehicles. The British lost shot down by aircraft and The Axis forces suffered casualties of or wounded, destroyed and shot down. The lost eight in air fighting. In 2004, Douglas Porch recorded that the Axis took at Bir Hakeim, only ten per cent of whom were French; Hitler had ordered that captured German political refugees were to be killed, an order that Rommel ignored.

<text>Eudaimonia (; ), sometimes anglicized as Eudaemonia, Eudemonia or Eudimonia, is a Greek word literally translating to the state or condition of &quot;good spirit&quot;, and which is commonly translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or &quot;welfare&quot;.

In the works of Aristotle, &quot;eudaimonia&quot; was the term for the highest human good in older Greek tradition. It is the aim of practical philosophy-prudence, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider and experience what this state really is and how it can be achieved. It is thus a central concept in Aristotelian ethics and subsequent Hellenistic philosophy, along with the terms &quot;aretē&quot; (most often translated as &quot;virtue&quot; or &quot;excellence&quot;) and &quot;phronesis&quot; (&#x27;practical or ethical wisdom&#x27;).

Discussion of the links between &quot;ēthikē aretē&quot; (virtue of character) and &quot;eudaimonia&quot; (happiness) is one of the central concerns of ancient ethics, and a subject of disagreement. As a result, there are many varieties of eudaimonism.

==Definition and etymology==
In terms of its etymology, &quot;eudaimonia&quot; is an abstract noun derived from the words &quot;eû&quot; (good, well) and &quot;daímōn&quot; (spirit or deity).

Semantically speaking, the word () derives from the same root of the Ancient Greek verb (&quot;&quot;, &quot;to divide&quot;) allowing the concept of &quot;eudaimonia&quot; to be thought of as an &quot;activity linked with dividing or dispensing, in a good way&quot;.

&quot;Definitions&quot;, a dictionary of Greek philosophical terms attributed to Plato himself but believed by modern scholars to have been written by his immediate followers in the Academy, provides the following definition of the word &quot;eudaimonia&quot;: &quot;The good composed of all goods; an ability which suffices for living well; perfection in respect of virtue; resources sufficient for a living creature.&quot;

In his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (§21; 1095a15–22), Aristotle says that everyone agrees that eudaimonia is the highest good for humans, but that there is substantial disagreement on what sort of life counts as doing and living well; i.e. eudaimon:Verbally there is a very general agreement; for both the general run of men and people of superior refinement say that it is [eudaimonia], and identify living well and faring well with being happy; but with regard to what [eudaimonia] is they differ, and the many do not give the same account as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious thing like pleasure, wealth or honour... [1095a17].
=== Eudaimonia and areté ===
One important move in Greek philosophy to answer the question of how to achieve eudaimonia is to bring in another important concept in ancient philosophy, &quot;aretē&quot; (&#x27;virtue&#x27;). Aristotle says that the eudaimonic life is one of &quot;virtuous activity in accordance with reason&quot; [1097b22–1098a20]; even Epicurus, who argues that the eudaimonic life is the life of pleasure, maintains that the life of pleasure coincides with the life of virtue. So, the ancient ethical theorists tend to agree that virtue is closely bound up with happiness (&quot;areté&quot; is bound up with &quot;eudaimonia&quot;). However, they disagree on the way in which this is so. A major difference between Aristotle and the Stoics, for instance, is that the Stoics believed moral virtue was in and of itself sufficient for happiness (eudaimonia). For the Stoics, one does not need external goods, like physical beauty, in order to have virtue and therefore happiness.

One problem with the English translation of &quot;areté&quot; as &quot;virtue&quot; is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense, which is not always what the ancients had in mind. For Aristotle, &quot;areté&quot; pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to ethics, for example, physical beauty. So it is important to bear in mind that the sense of &quot;virtue&quot; operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than states such as wisdom, courage, and compassion. The sense of virtue which &quot;areté&quot; connotes would include saying something like &quot;speed is a virtue in a horse&quot;, or &quot;height is a virtue in a basketball player&quot;. Doing anything well requires virtue, and each characteristic activity (such as carpentry, flute playing, etc.) has its own set of virtues. The alternative translation &quot;excellence&quot; (a desirable quality) might be helpful in conveying this general meaning of the term. The moral virtues are simply a subset of the general sense in which a human being is capable of functioning well or excellently.

=== Eudaimonia and happiness ===
Eudaimonia implies a positive and divine state of being that humanity is able to strive toward and possibly reach. A literal view of &quot;eudaimonia&quot; means achieving a state of being similar to a benevolent deity, or being protected and looked after by a benevolent deity. As this would be considered the most positive state to be in, the word is often translated as &quot;happiness&quot; although incorporating the divine nature of the word extends the meaning to also include the concepts of being fortunate, or blessed. Despite this etymology, however, discussions of eudaimonia in ancient Greek ethics are often conducted independently of any supernatural significance.

In his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (1095a15–22) Aristotle says that &quot;eudaimonia&quot; means &#x27;doing and living well&#x27;. It is significant that synonyms for &quot;eudaimonia&quot; are living well and doing well. In the standard English translation, this would be to say that, &quot;happiness is doing well and living well.&quot; The word &quot;happiness&quot; does not entirely capture the meaning of the Greek word. One important difference is that &quot;happiness&quot; often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind. For example, when one says that someone is &quot;a very happy person&quot;, one usually means that they seem subjectively contented with the way things are going in their life. They mean to imply that they feel good about the way things are going for them. In contrast, Aristotle suggests that eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one&#x27;s experience of feeling happy may affect one&#x27;s eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia depends on all the things that would make us happy if we knew of their existence, but quite independently of whether we do know about them. Ascribing eudaimonia to a person, then, may include ascribing such things as being virtuous, being loved and having good friends. But these are all objective judgments about someone&#x27;s life: they concern whether a person is really being virtuous, really being loved, and really having fine friends. This implies that a person who has evil sons and daughters will not be judged to be eudaimonic even if he or she does not know that they are evil and feels pleased and contented with the way they have turned out (happy). Conversely, being loved by your children would not count towards your happiness if you did not know that they loved you (and perhaps thought that they did not), but it would count towards your eudaimonia. So, eudaimonia corresponds to the idea of having an objectively good or desirable life, to some extent independently of whether one knows that certain things exist or not. It includes conscious experiences of well-being, success, and failure, but also a whole lot more. (See Aristotle&#x27;s discussion: &quot;Nicomachean Ethics,&quot; book 1.10–1.11.)

Because of this discrepancy between the meanings of &quot;eudaimonia&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot;, some alternative translations have been proposed. W.D. Ross suggests &#x27;well-being&#x27; and John Cooper proposes &quot;flourishing&quot;. These translations may avoid some of the misleading associations carried by &quot;happiness&quot; although each tends to raise some problems of its own. In some modern texts therefore, the other alternative is to leave the term in an English form of the original Greek, as &quot;eudaimonia&quot;.

==Classical views on eudaimonia and aretē==

===Socrates===

What is known of Socrates&#x27; philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato&#x27;s writings. Scholars typically divide Plato&#x27;s works into three periods: the early, middle, and late periods. They tend to agree also that Plato&#x27;s earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato&#x27;s own views, which go beyond those of Socrates, appear for the first time in the middle works such as the &quot;Phaedo&quot; and the &quot;Republic.&quot;

As with all ancient ethical thinkers, Socrates thought that all human beings wanted eudaimonia more than anything else (see Plato, &quot;Apology&quot; 30b, &quot;Euthydemus&quot; 280d–282d, &quot;Meno&quot; 87d–89a). However, Socrates adopted a quite radical form of eudaimonism (see above): he seems to have thought that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. Socrates is convinced that virtues such as self-control, courage, justice, piety, wisdom and related qualities of mind and soul are absolutely crucial if a person is to lead a good and happy (eudaimon) life. Virtues guarantee a happy life eudaimonia. For example, in the &quot;Meno&quot;, with respect to wisdom, he says: &quot;everything the soul endeavours or endures under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness&quot; (&quot;Meno&quot; 88c).

In the &quot;Apology&quot;, Socrates clearly presents his disagreement with those who think that the eudaimon life is the life of honour or pleasure, when he chastises the Athenians for caring more for riches and honour than the state of their souls.Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul? (29e) ... [I]t does not seem like human nature for me to have neglected all my own affairs and to have tolerated this neglect for so many years while I was always concerned with you, approaching each one of you like a father or an elder brother to persuade you to care for &quot;virtue&quot;. (31a–b; italics added)It emerges a bit further on that this concern for one&#x27;s soul, that one&#x27;s soul might be in the best possible state, amounts to acquiring moral virtue. So Socrates&#x27; pointing out that the Athenians should care for their souls means that they should care for their virtue, rather than pursuing honour or riches. Virtues are states of the soul. When a soul has been properly cared for and perfected, it possesses the virtues. Moreover, according to Socrates, this state of the soul, moral virtue, is the most important good. The health of the soul is incomparably more important for eudaimonia than (e.g.) wealth and political power. Someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions. This view is confirmed in the &quot;Crito&quot;, where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul, virtue, is the most important good:
And is life worth living for us with that part of us corrupted that unjust action harms and just action benefits? Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, that is concerned with justice and injustice, is inferior to the body? Not at all. It is much more valuable...? Much more... (47e–48a)
Here, Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing. In summary, Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy, and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy. We shall see later on that Stoic ethics takes its cue from this Socratic insight.

===Plato===
Plato&#x27;s great work of the middle period, the &quot;Republic&quot;, is devoted to answering a challenge made by the sophist Thrasymachus, that conventional morality, particularly the &quot;virtue&quot; of justice, actually prevents the strong man from achieving eudaimonia. Thrasymachus&#x27;s views are restatements of a position which Plato discusses earlier on in his writings, in the &quot;Gorgias&quot;, through the mouthpiece of Callicles. The basic argument presented by Thrasymachus and Callicles is that justice (being just) hinders or prevents the achievement of eudaimonia because conventional morality requires that we control ourselves and hence live with un-satiated desires. This idea is vividly illustrated in book 2 of the &quot;Republic&quot; when Glaucon, taking up Thrasymachus&#x27; challenge, recounts a myth of the magical ring of Gyges. According to the myth, Gyges becomes king of Lydia when he stumbles upon a magical ring, which, when he turns it a particular way, makes him invisible, so that he can satisfy any desire he wishes without fear of punishment. When he discovers the power of the ring he kills the king, marries his wife and takes over the throne. The thrust of Glaucon&#x27;s challenge is that no one would be just if he could escape the retribution he would normally encounter for fulfilling his desires at whim. But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire, whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire, then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality. (This general line of argument reoccurs much later in the philosophy of Nietzsche.) Throughout the rest of the &quot;Republic&quot;, Plato aims to refute this claim by showing that the virtue of justice is necessary for eudaimonia.

The argument of the &quot;Republic&quot; is lengthy and complex. In brief, Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul, and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious, with all its parts functioning properly to the person&#x27;s benefit. In contrast, Plato argues that the unjust man&#x27;s soul, without the virtues, is chaotic and at war with itself, so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires, his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia. Plato&#x27;s ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. On Plato&#x27;s version of the relationship, virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia.

===Aristotle===
Aristotle&#x27;s account is articulated in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; and the &quot;Eudemian Ethics&quot;. In outline, for Aristotle, eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (&quot;aretē&quot; sometimes translated as excellence) in accordance with reason. This conception of eudaimonia derives from Aristotle&#x27;s essentialist understanding of human nature, the view that reason (&quot;logos&quot; sometimes translated as rationality) is unique to human beings and that the ideal function or work (&quot;ergon&quot;) of a human being is the fullest or most perfect exercise of reason. Basically, well-being (eudaimonia) is gained by proper development of one&#x27;s highest and most human capabilities and human beings are &quot;the rational animal&quot;. It follows that eudaimonia for a human being is the attainment of excellence (&quot;areté&quot;) in reason.

According to Aristotle, eudaimonia actually requires activity, action, so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition. Eudaimonia requires not only good character but rational activity. Aristotle clearly maintains that to live in accordance with reason means achieving excellence thereby. Moreover, he claims this excellence cannot be isolated and so competencies are also required appropriate to related functions. For example, if being a truly outstanding scientist requires impressive math skills, one might say &quot;doing mathematics well is necessary to be a first rate scientist&quot;. From this it follows that eudaimonia, living well, consists in activities exercising the rational part of the psyche in accordance with the virtues or excellency of reason [1097b22–1098a20]. Which is to say, to be fully engaged in the intellectually stimulating and fulfilling work at which one achieves well-earned success. The rest of the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; is devoted to filling out the claim that the best life for a human being is the life of excellence in accordance with reason. Since the reason for Aristotle is not only theoretical but practical as well, he spends quite a bit of time discussing excellence of character, which enables a person to exercise his practical reason (i.e., reason relating to action) successfully.

Aristotle&#x27;s ethical theory is eudaimonist because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. However, it is Aristotle&#x27;s explicit view that virtue is necessary but not sufficient for eudaimonia. While emphasizing the importance of the rational aspect of the psyche, he does not ignore the importance of other &quot;goods&quot; such as friends, wealth, and power in a life that is eudaimonic. He doubts the likelihood of being eudaimonic if one lacks certain external goods such as &quot;good birth&quot;, &quot;good children&quot;, and &quot;beauty&quot;. So, a person who is hideously ugly or has &quot;lost children or good friends through death&quot; (1099b5–6), or who is isolated, is unlikely to be eudaimon. In this way, &quot;dumb luck&quot; (chance) can preempt one&#x27;s attainment of eudaimonia.

===Pyrrho===
Pyrrho was the founder of Pyrrhonism. A summary of his approach to eudaimonia was preserved by Eusebius, quoting Aristocles of Messene, quoting Timon of Phlius, in what is known as the &quot;Aristocles passage&quot;.

Whoever wants eudaimonia must consider these three questions: First, how are &quot;pragmata&quot; (ethical matters, affairs, topics) by nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?&quot; Pyrrho&#x27;s answer is that &quot;As for &quot;pragmata&quot; they are all adiaphora (undifferentiated by a logical differentia), &quot;astathmēta&quot; (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and &quot;anepikrita&quot; (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense-perceptions nor our &quot;doxai&quot; (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be &quot;adoxastoi&quot; (without views), &quot;aklineis&quot; (uninclined toward this side or that), and &quot;akradantoi&quot; (unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not.

With respect to aretē, the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus said:

If one defines a system as an attachment to a number of dogmas that agree with one another and with appearances, and defines a dogma as an assent to something non-evident, we shall say that the Pyrrhonist does not have a system. But if one says that a system is a way of life that, in accordance with appearances, follows a certain rationale, where that rationale shows how it is possible to seem to live rightly (&quot;rightly&quot; being taken, not as referring only to aretē, but in a more ordinary sense) and tends to produce the disposition to suspend judgment, then we say that he does have a system.

===Epicurus===

Epicurus&#x27; ethical theory is hedonistic. His views were very influential for the founders and best proponents of utilitarianism, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Hedonism is the view that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that pain is the only intrinsic bad. An object, experience or state of affairs is intrinsically valuable if it is good simply because of what it is. Intrinsic value is to be contrasted with instrumental value. An object, experience or state of affairs is instrumentally valuable if it serves as a means to what is intrinsically valuable. To see this, consider the following example. Suppose a person spends their days and nights in an office, working at not entirely pleasant activities for the purpose of receiving money. Someone asks them &quot;why do you want the money?&quot;, and they answer: &quot;So, I can buy an apartment overlooking the ocean, and a red sports car.&quot; This answer expresses the point that money is instrumentally valuable because its value lies in what one obtains by means of it—in this case, the money is a means to getting an apartment and a sports car and the value of making this money dependent on the price of these commodities.

Epicurus identifies the good life with the life of pleasure. He understands eudaimonia as a more or less continuous experience of pleasure and, also, freedom from pain and distress. But Epicurus does not advocate that one pursue any and every pleasure. Rather, he recommends a policy whereby pleasures are maximized &quot;in the long run&quot;. In other words, Epicurus claims that some pleasures are not worth having because they lead to greater pains, and some pains are worthwhile when they lead to greater pleasures. The best strategy for attaining a maximal amount of pleasure overall is not to seek instant gratification but to work out a sensible long term policy.

Ancient Greek ethics is eudaimonist because it links virtue and eudaimonia, where eudaimonia refers to an individual&#x27;s well-being. Epicurus&#x27; doctrine can be considered eudaimonist since Epicurus argues that a life of pleasure will coincide with a life of virtue. He believes that we do and ought to seek virtue because virtue brings pleasure. Epicurus&#x27; basic doctrine is that a life of virtue is the life that generates the most pleasure, and it is for this reason that we ought to be virtuous. This thesis—the eudaimon life is the pleasurable life—is not a tautology as &quot;eudaimonia is the good life&quot; would be: rather, it is the substantive and controversial claim that a life of pleasure and absence of pain is what eudaimonia consists in.

One important difference between Epicurus&#x27; eudaimonism and that of Plato and Aristotle is that for the latter virtue is a constituent of eudaimonia, whereas Epicurus makes virtue a means to happiness. To this difference, consider Aristotle&#x27;s theory. Aristotle maintains that eudaimonia is what everyone wants (and Epicurus would agree). He also thinks that eudaimonia is best achieved by a life of virtuous activity in accordance with reason. The virtuous person takes pleasure in doing the right thing as a result of a proper training of moral and intellectual character (See e.g., &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; 1099a5). However, Aristotle does not think that virtuous activity is pursued for the sake of pleasure. Pleasure is a byproduct of virtuous action: it does not enter at all into the reasons why virtuous action is virtuous. Aristotle does not think that we literally aim for eudaimonia. Rather, eudaimonia is what we achieve (assuming that we are not particularly unfortunate in the possession of external goods) when we live according to the requirements of reason. Virtue is the largest constituent in a eudaimon life.
By contrast, Epicurus holds that virtue is the means to achieve happiness. His theory is eudaimonist in that he holds that virtue is indispensable to happiness; but virtue is not a constituent of a eudaimon life, and being virtuous is not (external goods aside) identical with being eudaimon. Rather, according to Epicurus, virtue is only instrumentally related to happiness. So whereas Aristotle would not say that one ought to aim for virtue in order to attain pleasure, Epicurus would endorse this claim.

===The Stoics===
Stoic philosophy begins with Zeno of Citium , and was developed by Cleanthes (331–232 BC) and Chrysippus () into a formidable systematic unity. Zeno believed happiness was a &quot;good flow of life&quot;; Cleanthes suggested it was &quot;living in agreement with nature&quot;, and Chrysippus believed it was &quot;living in accordance with experience of what happens by nature.&quot; Stoic ethics is a particularly strong version of eudaimonism. According to the Stoics, virtue is necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. (This thesis is generally regarded as stemming from the Socrates of Plato&#x27;s earlier dialogues.)

We saw earlier that the conventional Greek concept of arete is not quite the same as that denoted by &quot;virtue&quot;, which has Christian connotations of charity, patience, and uprightness, since arete includes many non-moral virtues such as physical strength and beauty. However, the Stoic concept of arete is much nearer to the Christian conception of virtue, which refers to the moral virtues. However, unlike Christian understandings of virtue, righteousness or piety, the Stoic conception does not place as great an emphasis on mercy, forgiveness, self-abasement (i.e. the ritual process of declaring complete powerlessness and humility before God), charity and self-sacrificial love, though these behaviors/mentalities are not necessarily spurned by the Stoics (they are spurned by some other philosophers of Antiquity). Rather Stoicism emphasizes states such as justice, honesty, moderation, simplicity, self-discipline, resolve, fortitude, and courage (states which Christianity also encourages).

The Stoics make a radical claim that the eudaimon life is the morally virtuous life. Moral virtue is good, and moral vice is bad, and everything else, such as health, honour and riches, are merely &quot;neutral&quot;. The Stoics therefore are committed to saying that external goods such as wealth and physical beauty are not really good at all. Moral virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. In this, they are akin to Cynic philosophers such as Antisthenes and Diogenes in denying the importance to eudaimonia of external goods and circumstances, such as were recognized by Aristotle, who thought that severe misfortune (such as the death of one&#x27;s family and friends) could rob even the most virtuous person of eudaimonia. This Stoic doctrine re-emerges later in the history of ethical philosophy in the writings of Immanuel Kant, who argues that the possession of a &quot;good will&quot; is the only unconditional good. One difference is that whereas the Stoics regard external goods as neutral, as neither good nor bad, Kant&#x27;s position seems to be that external goods are good, but only so far as they are a condition to achieving happiness.

==Modern conceptions==
===&quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot;===
Interest in the concept of eudaimonia and ancient ethical theory more generally had a revival in the 20th century. G. E. M. Anscombe in her article &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; (1958) argued that duty-based conceptions of morality are conceptually incoherent for they are based on the idea of a &quot;law without a lawgiver&quot;. She claims a system of morality conceived along the lines of the Ten Commandments depends on someone having made these rules. Anscombe recommends a return to the eudaimonistic ethical theories of the ancients, particularly Aristotle, which ground morality in the interests and well-being of human moral agents, and can do so without appealing to any such lawgiver.

Julia Driver in the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; explains:

Anscombe&#x27;s article &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; stimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to Utilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories. Her primary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral theory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as &quot;morally ought&quot;, &quot;morally obligated&quot;, &quot;morally right&quot;, and so forth that are legalistic and require a legislator as the source of moral authority. In the past God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part of the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful employment of those concepts.

===Modern psychology===


Models of eudaimonia in psychology and positive psychology emerged from early work on self-actualization and the means of its accomplishment by researchers such as Erik Erikson, Gordon Allport, and Abraham Maslow (hierarchy of needs).

Theories include Diener&#x27;s tripartite model of subjective well-being, Ryff&#x27;s Six-factor Model of Psychological Well-being, Keyes work on flourishing, and Seligman&#x27;s contributions to positive psychology and his theories on &quot;authentic happiness&quot; and P.E.R.M.A. Related concepts are happiness, flourishing, quality of life, contentment, and meaningful life.

The Japanese concept of ikigai has been described as eudaimonic well-being, as it &quot;entails actions of devoting oneself to pursuits one enjoys and is associated with feelings of accomplishment and fulfillment.&quot;

=== Positive psychology on eudaimonia ===
The &quot;Questionnaire for Eudaimonic Well-Being&quot; developed in Positive Psychology lists six dimensions of eudaimonia:
# self-discovery;
# perceived development of one&#x27;s best potentials;
# a sense of purpose and meaning in life;
# investment of significant effort in pursuit of excellence;
# intense involvement in activities; and
# enjoyment of activities as personally expressive.

<text>USS &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was an , pre-dreadnought battleship and the second United States Navy ship comparable to foreign battleships of its time. Authorized in 1890, and commissioned six years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship class also pioneered the use of an intermediate battery. She was designed for coastal defense and as a result, her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; served in the Spanish–American War as part of the Flying Squadron and took part in the blockades of Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. She missed the decisive Battle of Santiago de Cuba after steaming to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. After the war she served with the North Atlantic Squadron, performing training maneuvers and gunnery practice. During this period she suffered an explosion in an gun turret, killing nine, and ran aground twice, requiring several months of repair both times. She was decommissioned in 1906, for modernization.

Although considered obsolete in 1910, the battleship was recommissioned and used for annual cruises for midshipmen during the summers, and otherwise laid up in the reserve fleet, until her decommissioning in 1914. In 1917, she was recommissioned to serve as a training ship for gun crews during World War I. She was decommissioned for the final time in March 1919, under the name &quot;Coast Battleship Number 2&quot; in anticipation that her name could be reused for (laid down April 1921). In 1921, she was scuttled in shallow water in the Gulf of Mexico, off Pensacola, Florida, and used as a target for experimental artillery. The wreck was never scrapped, and in 1956, it was declared the property of the State of Florida. Since 1993, the wreck has been a Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve and it is included in the National Register of Historic Places. It serves as an artificial reef and diving spot.

== Design ==
&quot;Massachusetts&quot; was constructed from a modified version of a design drawn up by a policy board in 1889 for a short-range battleship. The original design was part of an ambitious naval construction plan to build 33 battleships and 167 smaller ships. The United States Congress saw the plan as an attempt to end the US policy of isolationism and did not approve it, but a year later approved funding for three coast defense battleships, which would become &quot;Massachusetts&quot; and her sister ships and . The ships were limited to coastal defense due to their moderate endurance, relatively small displacement and low freeboard which limited seagoing capability. The ships proved to be disappointments in service, as they were badly overweight upon completion, their low freeboard hampered operations at sea, and they handled poorly. &quot;Conway&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; describes her design as &quot;attempting too much on a very limited displacement.&quot; They were nevertheless the first modern battleships for the American fleet.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at and four coal-fired fire-tube boilers, generating a top speed of . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . As built, she was fitted with a heavy military mast, this was later supplemented by a stern cage mast in 1910–1911. She had a crew of 32 officers and 441 enlisted men, which increased to a total of 586–636 officers and enlisted.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /35 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /35 cal. guns, which were placed in four twin wing turrets. These were supported by a battery of six /40 cal. guns in a casemate battery amidships. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty 6-pounder guns and six 1-pounder guns in individual mounts. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; carried  torpedo tubes in above-water mounts, though the number is unclear. According to &quot;Conway&#x27;s&quot;, she was fitted with six tubes, though the naval historian Norman Friedman states she was ordered with seven but completed with five.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and was reduced to at the bow and stern. The main battery gun turrets had thick sides, and the supporting barbettes had the same thickness of armor plate on their exposed sides. The 8 in turrets had 6 in of armor plating and the casemate battery had . The conning tower had thick sides.

Construction of the ships was authorized on 30 June 1890, and the contract for &quot;Massachusetts&quot;—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000. The total cost of the ship was almost twice as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates and guns caused a delay. Her keel was laid down on 25 June 1891, and she was launched two years later on 10 June 1893. The launching ceremony was attended by thousands of people, including Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert, and Commander George Dewey. Her preliminary sea trial did not take place until March 1896, because of the delays in armor and gun deliveries. At this point &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was almost complete, and her official trial was held a month later.

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; was commissioned on 10 June 1896, with Captain Frederick Rodgers in command. She had her shakedown cruise between August and November 1896, followed by an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. In February 1897, she made a short voyage to Charleston, South Carolina. The battleship departed New York, again in May, for Boston, where a celebration in her honor was held. For the next ten months the warship participated in training maneuvers with the North Atlantic Squadron, off the coast of Florida, and visited several major ports on the American east coast. On 27 March 1898, she was ordered to Hampton Roads, Virginia, to join the Flying Squadron, under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley, for the blockade of Cuba.

=== Spanish–American War ===
After the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, the Flying Squadron steamed to Key West. There, Schley met with Rear Admiral Sampson, who had just returned from the bombardment of San Juan, Puerto Rico. They discussed the possible locations of the Spanish squadron, under Admiral Cervera, and Schley was sent to the harbor of Cienfuegos, Cuba, to look for Cervera. Schley arrived off Cienfuegos, on 22 May, and took several days to establish that Cervera&#x27;s ships were not in the harbor. The squadron then proceeded to Santiago de Cuba, the only other port on the southern coast of Cuba that was large enough for the Spanish ships, arriving after several delays on 29 May. On arrival, the , was visible from outside the harbor entrance, confirming that the Spanish fleet was in the harbor. Schley blockaded the harbor and informed Sampson, who arrived with his own squadron on 1 June, and assumed overall command.

During the next month &quot;Massachusetts&quot; took part in the blockade of Santiago de Cuba, occasionally bombarding the harbor forts. On the night of 2–3 July, she and the two cruisers and , left the blockade to load coal in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This caused her to miss the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, on 3 July, in which the Spanish fleet attempted to break through the blockade and was completely destroyed. The next day the battleship came back to Santiago de Cuba, where she and fired at the disarmed , which was being scuttled by the Spanish, in an attempt to block the harbor entrance channel. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was then sent to Puerto Rico, to support the American occupation until she steamed home to New York, on 1 August, arriving on 20 August.

=== Post Spanish–American War ===
After a quick overhaul in drydock, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was attempting to leave New York Harbor on 10 December 1898, when she struck Diamond Reef, flooding five of her forward compartments. She was forced to return to the navy yard, where she was placed in drydock again for repairs which took around three months. For a year &quot;Massachusetts&quot; served with the North Atlantic Squadron, visiting various cities on the Atlantic coast. In May 1900, she and &quot;Indiana&quot; were placed in reserve as the navy had an acute officer shortage and needed to put the new and s into commission. The battleships were reactivated the following month as an experiment in how quickly this could be achieved, and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; returned to service with the North Atlantic Squadron.

In March 1901, the battleship grounded again, this time in the harbor of Pensacola, Florida, but the ship was able to continue her trip. A more serious accident occurred during target practice in January 1903, when an explosion in an turret killed nine crew members. They were the first fatalities aboard a United States battleship since the sinking of , in 1898. Another accident happened in August of that year, when &quot;Massachusetts&quot; grounded on a rock in Frenchman Bay, Maine. The ship was seriously damaged and had to be repaired in drydock. In December 1904, yet another lethal accident took place aboard &quot;Massachusetts&quot;: three men were killed and several others badly burned when a broken gasket caused steam to fill the boiler room. On 8 January 1906, the battleship was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to her sister ship &quot;Indiana&quot;, which had completed a three-year modernization. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; now received the same upgrades, including twelve /50 caliber single-purpose guns to replace the and most of the lighter guns, new Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, counterweights to balance her main turrets, a lattice mast, and electric traversing mechanisms for her turrets.

On 2 May 1910, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was placed in reduced commission so she could be used for the annual Naval Academy midshipmen summer cruise. Despite her modernizations the battleship was now regarded as &quot;obsolete and worthless, even for the second line of defense&quot; by Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer. She saw little use, other than summer cruises, and was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet when it was formed in 1912. After a quick trip to New York for a Presidential Fleet Review in October 1912, the warship returned to Philadelphia and stayed there until she was decommissioned on 23 May 1914.

===World War I and fate===

After the United States entered World War I, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was recommissioned for the final time, on 9 June 1917. She was used by Naval Reserve gun crews for gunnery training in Block Island Sound, until 27 May 1918. The battleship was then redeployed to serve as a heavy gun target practice ship near Chesapeake Bay, until the end of World War I. &quot;Massachusetts&quot; returned to Philadelphia, on 16 February 1919. She was decommissioned for the final time on 31 March 1919, after being re-designated &quot;Coast Battleship Number 2&quot; two days earlier so her name could be reused for the first &quot;South Dakota&quot;-class dreadnought battleship .

&quot;Massachusetts&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 November 1920, and loaned to the United States Department of War, then used as a target ship for experimental artillery. When the US Navy adopted hull numbers that year, &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was retroactively assigned the number &quot;BB-2&quot;. She was scuttled in shallow water in the Gulf of Mexico, off Pensacola, on 6 January 1921, and bombarded by the coastal batteries of Fort Pickens and by railway artillery. On 20 February 1925, the Department of War returned her wreck to the US Navy, which offered her for scrap, but no acceptable bids were received.

Eventually &quot;Massachusetts&quot; was declared the property of the State of Florida, by the Supreme Court of Florida. On 10 June 1993—the centennial anniversary of her launching—the site became the fourth Florida Underwater Archaeological Preserve. In 2001, the wreck also was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and it still serves as an artificial reef and diving spot.

<text>Herophilos (; ; 335–280 BC), sometimes Latinised Herophilus, was a Greek physician regarded as one of the earliest anatomists. Born in Chalcedon, he spent the majority of his life in Alexandria. He was the first scientist to systematically perform scientific dissections of human cadavers. He recorded his findings in over nine works, which are now all lost. The early Christian author Tertullian states that Herophilos vivisected at least 600 live prisoners; however, this account has been disputed by many historians. He is often seen as the father of anatomy.

==Life==
Herophilos was born in Chalcedon in Asia Minor (now Kadıköy, Turkey), c. 335 BC. Not much is known about his early life other than he moved to Alexandria at a fairly young age to begin his schooling.

As an adult Herophilos was a teacher, and an author of at least nine texts ranging from his book titled &quot;On Pulses&quot;, which explored the flow of blood from the heart through the arteries, to his book titled &quot;Midwifery&quot;, which discussed duration and phases of childbirth. In Alexandria, he practiced dissections, often publicly so that he could explain what he was doing to those who were fascinated. Erasistratus was his contemporary. Together, they worked at a medical school in Alexandria that is said to have drawn people from all over the ancient world due to Herophilos&#x27;s fame.

His works are lost but were much quoted by Galen in the second century AD. Herophilos was the first scientist to systematically perform scientific dissections of human cadavers. Dissections of human cadavers were banned in most places at the time, except for Alexandria. Celsus in &quot;De Medicina&quot; and the church leader Tertullian state that he vivisected at least 600 live prisoners, though this has been contested as Herophilos appeared to have believed the arteries contained very little blood which he wouldn&#x27;t have believed had he performed live dissections.

After the death of Herophilos in 280 BC, his anatomical findings lived on in the works of other important physicians, notably Galen. The Middle Ages witnessed the revival of an interest in medical studies, including human dissection and autopsy. Frederick II (1194–1250), the Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that any that were studying to be a physician or a surgeon must attend a human dissection, which would be held no less than every five years. Some European countries began legalizing the dissection of executed criminals for educational purposes in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Mondino de Luzzi carried out the first recorded public dissection around 1315. Dissecting with the purpose to gain knowledge about human anatomy continued in early modern times (Vesalius).

==Medicine==
Herophilos emphasised the use of the experimental method in medicine, for he considered it essential to found knowledge on empirical bases. He was a forerunner of the Empiric school of medicine, founded by Herophilos&#x27;s pupil Philinus of Cos, which combined Herophilos&#x27;s empirical impulses with critical tools borrowed from Pyrrhonist philosophy. However, the Empirics found Herophilos wanting, mounting two chief attacks against him:

# that anatomy was useless to the therapeutic and clinical practice of medicine, as demonstrated by Herophilos&#x27;s own acceptance of humoral pathology.
# it was useless and epistemologically unsound to try to find causal explanations from the evident to the non-evident.

Conventional medicine of the time revolved around the theory of the four humors in which an imbalance between bile, black bile, phlegm, and blood led to sickness or disease. Veins were believed to be filled with blood and a mixture of air and water. Through dissections, Herophilus was able to deduce that veins carried only blood. After studying the flow of blood, he was able to differentiate between arteries and veins. He noticed that as blood flowed through arteries, they pulsed or rhythmically throbbed. He worked out standards for measuring a pulse and could use these standards to aid him in diagnosing sicknesses or diseases. To measure this pulse, he made use of a water clock.

Herophilos&#x27;s work on blood and its movements led him to study and analyse the brain. He proposed that the brain housed the intellect rather than the heart. He was the first person to differentiate between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and to place individual importance on each portion. He looked more in depth into the network of nerves located in the cranium.

Herophilos was particularly interested in the eye. He described the optic nerve for seeing and the oculomotor nerve for eye movements. Through his dissection of the eye, he discovered its different sections and layers: the &quot;skin&quot; of the eyeball comprising the cornea (the clear part at the front of the eye through which light begins to be focussed into the eye) and sclera (the white of the eye), the iris (the colored part of the eye surrounding the pupil), the retina (containing the cells converting light into neural activity), and the choroid (a layer between the retina and the sclera comprising connective tissue and blood vessels nourishing the retina). Herophilos used the term &quot;retiform&quot; to describe the retina, from its resemblance to a casting net, giving the origin of the modern term.

Further study of the cranium led Herophilos to describe the &quot;calamus scriptorius&quot;, which he believed was the seat of the human soul. Analysis of the nerves in the cranium allowed him to differentiate between nerves and blood vessels and to discover the differences between motor and sensory nerves. He believed that the sensory and motor nerves shot out from the brain and that the neural transmissions occurred by means of &quot;pneuma&quot;. Part of Herophilos&#x27;s beliefs about the human body involved the pneuma, which he believed was a substance that flowed through the arteries along with the blood. To make this consistent with medical beliefs at the time, Herophilos stated that diseases occurred when an excess of one of the four humors impeded the pneuma from reaching the brain.

Herophilos also introduced many other scientific terms used to this day to describe anatomical phenomena. He was among the first to introduce the notion of conventional terminology, as opposed to use of &quot;natural names&quot;, using terms he created to describe the objects of study, naming them for the first time. A confluence of sinuses in the skull was originally named &quot;torcular Herophili&quot; after him. Torcular is a Latin translation of Herophilos&#x27;s label, &quot;ληνός - lenos&quot;, &#x27;wine vat&#x27; or &#x27;wine press&#x27;. He also named the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine. Other areas of his anatomical study include the liver, the pancreas, and the alimentary tract, as well as the salivary glands and genitalia.

Herophilos is credited with learning extensively about the physiology of the female reproductive system. In his book &quot;Midwifery&quot;, he discussed phases and duration of pregnancy as well as causes for difficult childbirth. The aim of this work was to help midwives and other doctors of the time more fully understand the process of procreation and pregnancy. He is also credited with the discovery of the ovum, and was the first to make a scientific description of what would later be called Skene&#x27;s gland, for which in 2001 the term &quot;female prostate&quot; was accepted as a second term.

Herophilos believed that exercise and a healthy diet were integral to an individual&#x27;s bodily health. He once said that &quot;when health is absent, wisdom cannot reveal itself, art cannot become manifest, strength cannot be exerted, wealth is useless, and reason is powerless&quot;.

<text>William Sampson ( – 28 March 2012) was a dual British and Canadian national who was arrested in Saudi Arabia on 17 December 2000 on a variety of charges including terrorism, espionage and murder. He was imprisoned and tortured for two years and seven months, and finally released and permitted to leave Saudi Arabia, along with several of his co-accused, on 8 August 2003.

In 2005 Sampson published a book about his experience entitled &quot;Confessions of an Innocent Man: Torture and Survival in a Saudi Prison&quot;.

==Early life==

Sampson was born at Soldiers Memorial Hospital in Middleton, Nova Scotia, Canada. The son of a British father and a Canadian mother, Sampson spent periods in Canada, the United Kingdom and Singapore. At age 16 he joined the Seaforth Highlanders militia in Vancouver. He stayed on for 18 months. He held an MBA from the University of Edinburgh and a PhD in biochemistry.

He worked in biochemical research and pharmaceutical marketing prior to moving to Riyadh in 1998 to work as a marketing consultant with the Saudi Industrial Development Fund, a government development bank.

==Arrest==

On the morning of 17 December 2000, Sampson was taken at gunpoint by police as he left his home in Riyadh on his way to work. He was taken to al-Ha&#x27;ir Prison where regular sessions of physical and psychological torture immediately began. Among other things, Sampson says he was raped by two men and repeatedly beaten, foot whipped, and deprived of sleep.

After six initial days of torture largely conducted by three men, Ibrahim al-Dali (officer of the Mabaheth, the Saudi Arabian internal intelligence service), Khaled al-Saleh (officer of the Mabaheth) and a third unnamed man Sampson nicknamed &quot;the Spiv,&quot; Sampson confessed and subsequently provided both written and videotaped confessions; he was sentenced to death by &quot;al-haad&quot;, a form of execution in which the victim is restrained and decapitated. The torture continued in various forms until his release.

A Saudi official has denied that Sampson was tortured.

==Alleged crimes==

Sampson was one of nine foreign nationals arrested on allegations of involvement in a series of car bombings targeting Western expatriates in Riyadh. British engineer Christopher Rodway was killed and his wife injured in one explosion, and a second bomb injured Britons Mark Paine and Steve Coughlan. The Saudi authorities claimed that the bombings were part of a turf war within a Western liquor trafficking ring, though the men claimed they were further forced to confess. The widow of Christopher Rodway, Jane Rodway, denied that her husband was involved in liquor trafficking.

In his videotaped confession, broadcast internationally on 5 February 2001, Sampson said:

==Release==

In August 2003, after 31 months&#x27; incarceration in solitary confinement, Sampson and the others were suddenly released, and immediately deported to the UK. Charles, Prince of Wales, Rubin Carter, Christopher Rodway&#x27;s son Justin Rodway, and Canadian members of parliament, Stéphane Dion and Dan McTeague were part of the diplomatic effort to obtain the release. In July 2004, it was revealed that the final release was part of a prisoner exchange for the release of five Saudis from the US prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Officials of both the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (UK) and the State Department (USA) have anonymously confirmed this information. A memorandum between officials of the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs referring to the prisoner exchange adds further evidence of its occurrence. The Belgian government has confirmed both the authenticity of the memo and its knowledge of the exchange, but has denied any direct involvement in the negotiations. The Canadian government refuses to comment on the matter.

==Legal case==

On 28 October 2004, Sampson, along with Britons Sandy Mitchell and Les Walker, won a legal battle in London, UK that allows them to sue the men in Saudi Arabia they say tortured them into making the false confessions. In February 2005, a coroner&#x27;s inquest into the death of Christopher Rodway, held in Trowbridge, concluded that there was no evidence to indicate that Sampson and Mitchell had any involvement in the death, and thus were not involved in the incident for which the Saudi Arabian government had arrested them. In June 2006, a decision handed down at the Law Lords overturned the earlier ruling of the Court of Appeal. Sampson, along with Mitchell and Walker appealed to the European Court of Human Rights claiming that the law in Britain, as interpreted in the Lords&#x27; decision, is a violation of their rights under Article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights.

In June 2006 the group&#x27;s appeal was overturned by the Law Lords on the grounds that Saudi officials are protected in Britain by the State Immunity Act 1978.

In 2007, Sampson was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada-co-produced documentary.

==Criticism of the Canadian government==

Sampson repeatedly criticised the Canadian government for its actions during his incarceration. Sampson stated that his torturers were present at every meeting he had with Canadian diplomats and government representatives, who never insisted they leave and indeed accepted the Saudis&#x27; claims of Sampson&#x27;s guilt, despite the lack of evidence, inconsistencies, and the statements to the contrary by Sampson and his supporters. He also alleged that he repeatedly informed embassy officials and Canadian medical professionals that he was being tortured, but to no avail.

==Death==
Sampson died of a heart attack at his home in northern England on 28 March 2012. According to Marni Soupcof, writing in the &quot;National Post&quot;, at the time of his death Canada was still failing Sampson. She criticized Canadian diplomatic officials for asking Sampson about torture when his torturers were present, and failing to realise he couldn&#x27;t answer candidly. She rejected claims Canada had learned a lesson in being pro-active in protecting its citizens in custody overseas.

<doc id="189633" wikidata="Q728956" url="?curid=189633" title="Chris Brasher">
<text>Christopher William Brasher CBE (21 August 1928 – 28 February 2003) was a British track and field athlete, Olympic champion, sports journalist and co-founder of the London Marathon.

==Early life and education==
Born in Georgetown, British Guiana, Brasher went to Rugby School and then St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he read geology. He was a keen mountaineer, and as a student was president of the Cambridge University Mountaineering Club, and in 1948 led an expedition to Baffin Island with W. A. Deer.

==Sporting career==
On 6 May 1954, he acted as pacemaker for Roger Bannister when the latter ran the first sub-four-minute mile at Iffley Road Stadium in Oxford. Brasher paced Bannister for the first two laps, while his friend Chris Chataway paced the third. Two years later, at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Brasher finished first in the 3,000 metres steeplechase with a time of 8 minutes 41.2 seconds, but was disqualified for allegedly interfering with another runner, Ernst Larsen of Norway. The following day, after an investigation, he was reinstated as gold medallist. Brasher had been celebrating for several hours before the delayed medal ceremony, and later claimed to have been “the only Olympic champion to be totally and absolutely slaughtered when he received a medal”.

He was one of the pioneers of orienteering in Britain and can claim the first public mention of the sport in an article in &quot;The Observer&quot; in 1957:

:&quot;I have just taken part, for the first time, in one of the best sports in the world. It is hard to know what to call it. The Norwegians call it &#x27;orientation&#x27;...&quot;

==Later career==
He had distinguished careers in print journalism, as sports editor for &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, and in broadcasting, as a reporter for the &quot;Tonight&quot; programme.

He founded Chris Brasher&#x27;s Sporting Emporium in 1971; this later became Sweatshop. In 1978, he designed the innovative Brasher Boot – a walking boot with the comfort of a running shoe. In their time these were amongst the best products, but declined in quality, were merged with Berghaus under Pentland ownership in 2014, and were finally discontinued before 2017.

In 1981 John Disley and Brasher founded the London Marathon. In 1983 he became the second president of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races, an office which he held until 1987.

Also in 1983 Brasher partnered with his longtime friend John Disley to found Fleetfoot Limited in Lancaster, England. Fleetfoot distributed The Brasher Boot and other sporting goods to retailers. Fleetfoot acquired the rights to be the UK distributor of Reebok and subsequently traded as Reebok UK before becoming a subsidiary of the Pentland Group in 1988.

After the acquisition by Pentland, Brasher remained active in the company as chairman of the board. Reebok UK was sold to Reebok International in 1990 when Pentland Group sold its 55% ownership of Reebok United States and Reebok International.

==Personal life and honours==

Brasher married the English tennis champion Shirley Bloomer in 1959.

Brasher was awarded the CBE in 1996. He was awarded the Royal Scottish Geographical Society&#x27;s Livingstone Medal in 2002.

In 2003, he died at his home in Chaddleworth, Berkshire, after struggling for several months against pancreatic cancer.

<doc id="189637" wikidata="Q7247167" url="?curid=189637" title="Procedures of the United States House of Representatives">
<text>The United States Constitution provides that each &quot;House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,&quot; therefore each Congress of the United States, upon convening, approves its own governing rules of procedure. This clause has been interpreted by the courts to mean that a new Congress is not bound by the rules of proceedings of the previous Congress.

Currently the procedures of the United States House of Representatives are governed by the Constitution, the House Rules, and Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Manual&quot;.

== Rules of the House ==

Prior to the adoption of the rules by the United States House of Representatives, the House operates under general parliamentary rules and Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;Manual&quot; but these are not binding on the current House until they are approved by the membership of the current Congress. Historically, the current Congress will adopt the rules of the previous Congress and make any amendments they think are necessary to govern themselves.

The Rules of the House of Representatives are prepared by the Clerk of the House. 

On December 6, 2016, in the final month of the 114th Congress, the House resolved that a revised version of the Rules would be printed for the 115th Congress.

== House Floor ==

=== Rules of Decorum ===
While on the floor of the House of Representatives, Members are bound by a number of rules on their behavior. Clause 5 of Rule XVII of the House Rules forbids:

* Exiting or crossing the hall while the Speaker is addressing the House.
* Passing between the Chair and a Member under recognition.
* Wearing a hat (This provision was modified in the 116th Congress to allow religious head coverings).
* Using a mobile electronic device that impairs decorum.
* Remaining by the Clerk&#x27;s desk during roll calls.
*Smoking.

Clause 7 of Rule XVII forbids Members from &quot;bring[ing] to the attention of the House an occupant in the galleries of the House&quot;. In practice, this prevents Members from talking about the visitors who are seated in the galleries above.

While the proscription on using electronic devices is more recent, some of the current House Rules originated in the early sessions of Congress. After independence, members of Congress would often wear their hats, as was the custom in the British Parliament, however this custom was abolished in the House of Representatives in 1837.

=== Daily business ===
The Speaker calls the House to order, the Chaplain of the House then offers a prayer, and the Speaker and House approves the legislative journal from the previous legislative day. After approval of the journal the members recite the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by the start of legislative business.

====Order of priority of business====
The House generally adheres to the following order of priority as outlined in the House Rules, specifically Rule XIV during the 114th Congress, but variations exist to this order as a result of House Rules or parliamentary rules that take precedence. The House may suspend this order and conduct itself as it sees fit consistent with House Rules and with Parliamentary procedure.

#Prayer by the Chaplain.
#Reading and approval of the Journal.
#The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.
#Correction of reference of public bills.
#Disposal of business on the Speaker&#x27;s table.
#Unfinished business as provided in rules.
#Consideration of bills called up by committees.
#State of the Union
#Orders of the day.

=== Speaking on the Floor ===
At the beginning of the legislative business day, after the prayer, approval of the previous day&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot;, and pledge of allegiance, the Speaker of the House may recognize members for one-minute speeches. The rules of the House do not specifically provide for one-minute speeches, rather they have evolved as a unanimous consent practice of the chamber, where members must ask for unanimous consent to address the chamber. Under the power of House Rule XVII, clause 2, the Speaker decides when to entertain unanimous consent requests to address the House for one-minute, and how many speeches will be allowed. There may be unlimited time for speeches, or pressing legislative business may necessitate a shorter time. If there are any limitations on time, the majority and minority leadership typically receive advance notice.

Members do not need to receive prior authorization to deliver a one-minute speech. To deliver a one-minute speech, members go to the front row of seats on their party’s side of the Floor and sit down. The Speaker will recognize members in turn, alternating between the majority and minority sides. When the chair announces that one minute has expired, the Member can finish the sentence underway but must then stop speaking. If the member cannot finish their remarks in one minute, they may insert additional material, either the full speech or extraneous materials, such as constituent communications or newspaper articles, into the Congressional Record. The inserted material appears in a distinct typeface in the Congressional Record, typically italics.

One-minute speeches have many uses in Congress, including allowing members to explain a new bill or a floor amendment they will offer later in the day. Representatives also use one-minute speeches to deliver eulogies and tributes concerning individuals and organizations in their congressional district. One minutes also provide Members with an opportunity to express their views on bills, policy issues, and local, national, and international events. These speeches are one of the few unrestricted options members of Congress have to express a position.

Not all members of Congress use one-minute speeches equally. In previous studies of legislative behavior, results suggest institutionally disadvantaged members of Congress, members who may have limited position-taking opportunities through traditional channels, are more likely to deliver a one-minute speech. These include junior members of Congress, members of the minority party in the House, ideologically extreme representatives, or non-committee chairs. These members of Congress have little opportunity to shape the legislative process, and therefore rely on alternative mechanisms, such as one-minute speeches to represent their constituents.

On February 7, 2018, Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) delivered the then-longest one-minute speech since at least 1909, speaking for eight hours and seven minutes. Pelosi&#x27;s speech took advantage of a rule that allows only top party leaders (the Speaker, the Majority Leader, and the Minority Leader) the right to speak as long as they want: this custom is called the leadership minute, or magic minute. In November 2021, minority leader Kevin McCarthy used the minute to speak for eight hours and thirty-two minutes, the longest in the House&#x27;s modern history, prior to the passage of Joe Biden&#x27;s Build Back Better bill.

===Introducing a bill===
Any member of the House can introduce a bill at any time, while the House is in session, by placing (or most likely having a page place) a signed copy of the bill in the &quot;hopper&quot; at the side of the Clerk&#x27;s desk on the Rostrum. Other members of the House may co-sponsor any bill to be introduced in the House by a member. These co-sponsors are not required to sign the bill and are considered under House Rules to be &quot;original co-sponsors&quot; and &quot;additional co-sponsors&quot; depending on whether they co-sponsored the bill at the time it was introduced or added their names to the bill after its introduction.

After the Clerk of the House receives the bill it is then assigned a legislative number, enrolled in the House Journal and printed in the Congressional Record and the Speaker of the House refers the bill to the Committee(s) with jurisdiction by sending the bill to the office of the chairman of the committee(s), and the Clerk of the Committee will add the bill to the Committee&#x27;s calendar. The Speaker designates one of these committees as a &quot;primary committee&quot; with primary jurisdiction and responsibility for the bill and all other committee(s) are considered &quot;additional committees.&quot; The Speaker may impose time limits on these committee(s) when appropriate - traditionally if the primary committee has reported out a version of the bill to the full House.

===House floor action on a bill===
Upon being reported out of Committee or removed from Committee by the House, a bill will be added to the House Calendar and any rules setting out how much time is allowed for debate, or other matters may be passed by the House in the form of a resolution. Generally, the supporters and opponents of a bill control debate time and may yield time to members who wish to speak upon the bill. In many instances this is the chairman and ranking member of the primary committee. If amendments are permitted under the rules governing floor action on the bill they are debated and voted upon at the time of the amendment (although common practice usually permits the House to debate several amendments without immediately voting on them, then voting back-to-back at the end of the series of amendments, which can either be voice votes or recorded votes). After the conclusion of time for debate and after all amendments have been disposed of, the matter is usually voted upon by the full House, unless the rules permit and a member moves to recommit (or commit) the bill back to committee. The chair will only recognize a member who is opposed to the bill for a Motion to Recommit and gives preference to members of the minority party. A motion to recommit may take two forms:
*&quot;with instructions to take some action and then report back the bill forthwith&quot;, which will result in the Committee chairman immediately re-reporting to the House the bill according to the instructions in the motion to recommit;
*&quot;without instructions&quot;, which leaves the bill in committee for reconsideration.

==Committees==

It is in Committee(s) that bills get the most scrutiny and attention and that most of the work on a bill is done. Committees play an important role in the legislative process by providing members the opportunity to study, debate and amend the bill and the public with the opportunity to make comments on the bill. There are three types of House Committees, these are: 

1) standing committees elected by members of the House, 

2) select committees appointed by the Speaker of the House, and 

3) joint committees whose members are chosen according to the statute or resolution that created that committee. 

As the House Rules limit the amount of floor debate on any given bill the committees play an important function in determining the final content and format of the bill.

After the committee conducts any necessary research, and has debated and voted on any amendments that were offered in committee they may take one of three actions. These are reporting a measure to the full House with or without amendments, report the measure to the full House with a negative recommendation or fail to report the measure. The House may under certain rules remove the bill or measure from committee (see discharge petition) if the committee fails to report the measure to the House Rules Committee or to the full House and a negative report to the full House does not terminate the bill. The phrase that a &quot;bill has been killed in committee&quot; is not completely accurate as the full House always has options under the rules to remove the bill from Committee and to take action.

===Standing committees===
Standing committees are established at the time that the rules of the House are adopted or by amending the House Rules. The jurisdiction of each standing committee is specified in the House Rules. Under the House Rules the chairman and members of standing committees are selected through a two-step procedure where the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference recommends members to serve on Committees, the majority party recommends a Chairman, and the Minority Party recommends a Ranking Member and finally the full House can approve the recommendation of the Party Caucuses.

The Rules of the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference determine the nomination procedure of its own members. Rules of party nominations may therefore differ but approval by the House of these nominations is conducted according to House Rules. Seniority on a Standing Committee is based on the order of the members on the election resolution as approved by the House. The number of members who serve on a committee along with the party ratio of a committee is determined by the Majority and Minority Leaders of the House with the exception of the Committee on Ethics which is limited by the Rules to 5 majority members and 5 minority members.

===Membership===

The number of members on a committee and the ratio of majority/minority members is determined by the Majority party with consultation with the minority. According to House Rules members of the House of Representatives may serve on two committees and four subcommittees. Seniority on a committee is not based on the longest-serving member of the House but on their order of appointment to that committee by their respective party caucus. The Committee Chairman is usually the ranking majority member in order of seniority (order of appointment). If a member of the House ceases to be a member of his caucus then he ceases having membership on that committee. Independent members of the House may caucus with either the Republican Conference or the Democratic Caucus and thus be appointed to and serve on Committees. Current House Rules also stipulate that a member cannot serve as chairman of the same standing committee or subcommittee for more than three consecutive Congresses (six years).

===Chairman and ranking member===

The House Rules provide that the chairman of a committee presides over its meetings, maintains decorum and ensures that the committee adheres to the House Rules governing committees and generally acts in an administrative role respective to such issues as determining salaries of committee staff, issuing congressional subpoenas for testimony and issuing committee reports. The committee&#x27;s minority may also issue a Minority Report at their discretion. Also, a committee chairman along with the ranking member generally control the time each receives on the House Floor respective to a bill that originated or was reported out of their committee. The ranking member is second to the chairman.

===Committee staff===

According to House Rules each Standing Committee may have up to 30 persons appointed to serve as professional staff, 2/3 of which are selected by the majority committee members and 1/3 of which are selected by the minority members. This allows each party serving in the Committee to have professional staff available to assist them in performing their committee assignments and duties.

<doc id="189639" wikidata="Q3274004" url="?curid=189639" title="USS Delaware (BB-28)">
<text>USS &quot;Delaware&quot; (BB-28) was a dreadnought battleship of the United States Navy, the lead ship of her class. She was laid down at Newport News Shipbuilding in November 1907, launched in January 1909, and completed in April 1910. The sixth ship to be named for the First State, &quot;Delaware&quot; was armed with a main battery of ten guns all on the centerline, making her the most powerful battleship in the world at the time of her construction. She was also the first battleship of the US Navy to be capable of steaming at full speed for 24 continuous hours without suffering a breakdown.

&quot;Delaware&quot; served in the Atlantic Fleet throughout her career. During World War I, she sailed to Great Britain to reinforce the British Grand Fleet, in the 6th Battle Squadron. She saw no action during the war, however, as both the British and Germans had abandoned direct confrontation with each other. After the end of the war, she returned to her peacetime duties of fleet maneuvers, midshipmen cruises, and good-will visits to foreign ports. Under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, &quot;Delaware&quot; was retained until the new battleship was completed in 1924, at which point she was broken up for scrap in accordance with the treaty.

==Design==

The two &quot;Delaware&quot;-class battleships were ordered in response to the British battleship , the first all-big-gun battleship to enter service. The previous American dreadnoughts, the , had been designed before the particulars of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; were known. The Navy decided that another pair of battleships should be built to counter the perceived superiority of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; over &quot;South Carolina&quot;, and so Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps prepared a design for a ship with an additional main battery gun turret to match &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s ten guns. But unlike &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, all ten of &quot;Delaware&quot;″s guns could fire on the broadside. At the time of her construction, &quot;Delaware&quot; was the largest and most powerful battleship then building in the world.

&quot;Delaware&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. Her bow had an early example of bulbous forefoot. She had a crew of 933 officers and men.

The ship was powered by two-shaft vertical triple-expansion engines rated at and fourteen coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers, generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Also, because &quot;Delaware&quot;″s engine bearings were equipped with forced lubrication instead of a gravity-fed system, she was the first American battleship capable of steaming at full speed for 24 hours without any need for engine repair.

The ship was armed with a main battery of ten 12-inch/45 caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin Mark 7 gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other three turrets were placed aft of the superstructure. The secondary battery consisted of 14 /50 caliber Mark 6 guns mounted on Mark 9 and Mark 12 pedestal mounts in casemates along the side of the hull. As was standard for capital ships of the period, she carried a pair of torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Delaware&quot;″s main armored belt was thick, while the armored deck was thick. The gun turrets had thick faces and the conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

&quot;Delaware&quot; was built by Newport News Shipbuilding; she was laid down on 11 November 1907 and was launched on 6 January 1909. After completion of the fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the United States Navy on 4 April 1910. On 3 October, she steamed to Wilmington, Delaware, where she received a set of silver service from her namesake state. The battleship then returned to Hampton Roads on the 9th, and remained there until she left to join the First Division of the Atlantic Fleet, on 1 November. She and the rest of the division visited England and France, and then conducted maneuvers off Cuba in January 1911.

On 17 January, a boiler explosion aboard &quot;Delaware&quot; killed eight men and badly scalded another. On 31 January, the ship carried the remains of Don Anibal Cruz, the Chilean ambassador to the United States, back to Chile. She steamed by way of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, around the tip of South America, to Punta Arenas, Chile. She returned to New York City on 5 May, and then left for Portsmouth on 4 June to participate in the coronation fleet review for King George V.

Throughout the next five years, &quot;Delaware&quot; participated in the normal peacetime routine of fleet and squadron maneuvers, gunnery drills, and torpedo practice in the Atlantic Fleet. During the summer months, she conducted training cruises for midshipmen from the Naval Academy. She was present in the Naval Review of 14 October 1912, attended by President William Howard Taft and the Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer. In 1913, she conducted a good-will visit to Villefranche, France, along with the battleships and . She participated in the intervention in Mexico at Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution, to protect American citizens in the area.

===World War I===

Following the American entrance into World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;Delaware&quot; had recently returned to Hampton Roads from fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea. There, she trained new armed guard crews and engine room personnel as the Atlantic Fleet prepared to go to war. On 25 November 1917, she sailed with the rest of Battleship Division 9, bound for Britain to reinforce the Grand Fleet in the North Sea. Once in Scapa Flow, the division joined the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. The 6th Battle Squadron was tasked with serving as the &quot;fast wing&quot; of the Grand Fleet. On 14 December, &quot;Delaware&quot; participated in joint Anglo-American maneuvers to practice coordination of the Allied fleet.

Starting in late 1917, the Germans had begun to use surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia; this forced the British to send squadrons from the Grand Fleet to escort the convoys. On 6 February 1918, the 6th Battle Squadron and eight British destroyers escorted a convoy of merchant ships to Norway. While steaming off Stavanger on the 8th, &quot;Delaware&quot; was attacked twice by a German U-boat, though evasive maneuvers allowed &quot;Delaware&quot; to escape undamaged. The squadron was back in Scapa Flow on 10 February; &quot;Delaware&quot; escorted two more such convoys in March and April. On 22–24 April, the German High Seas Fleet sortied to intercept one of the convoys in the hope of cutting off and destroying the escorting battleship squadron. &quot;Delaware&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet left Scapa Flow on 24 April in an attempt to intercept the Germans, but the High Seas Fleet had already broken off the operation and returned to port.

Starting on 30 June, the 6th Battle Squadron and a division of British destroyers covered a group of American minelayers as they laid the North Sea mine barrage; the work lasted until 2 July. King George V inspected the Grand Fleet, including &quot;Delaware&quot;, at Rosyth. Thereafter, &quot;Delaware&quot; was relieved by the battleship ; &quot;Delaware&quot; then sailed across the Atlantic, arriving in Hampton Roads on 12 August.

===Post-war===
&quot;Delaware&quot; remained at York River until 12 November 1918, the day after the Armistice with Germany was signed, effectively ending World War I. She then sailed to Boston Navy Yard for an overhaul. &quot;Delaware&quot; rejoined the fleet on 11 March 1919 for training maneuvers off Cuba. She returned to New York with her division on 14 April, where additional divisional, squadron, and fleet exercises were conducted. She was present for another Naval Review on 28 April 1921 in Hampton Roads. From 5 June to 31 August 1922, &quot;Delaware&quot; conducted a training cruise for midshipmen to various ports in the Caribbean along with to Halifax, Nova Scotia. She went on another cruise to Europe from 9 July to 29 August 1923, and visited Copenhagen, Greenock, Cádiz, and Gibraltar.

In the years immediately following the end of the war, the United States, Britain, and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs. All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill-advised, and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations, which produced the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922. Under the terms of Article II of the treaty, &quot;Delaware&quot; and her sister were to be scrapped as soon as the new battleships and , then under construction, were ready to join the fleet. On 30 August 1923, &quot;Delaware&quot; accordingly entered dry dock in the Norfolk Navy Yard; her crew was transferred to the recently commissioned &quot;Colorado&quot;, and the process of disposal began. &quot;Delaware&quot; was transferred to the Boston Navy Yard, decommissioned on 10 November, and disarmed. She was then sold on 5 February 1924 and subsequently broken up for scrap.

<text>The Corded Ware culture comprises a broad archaeological horizon of Europe between  – 2350 BC, thus from the late Neolithic, through the Copper Age, and ending in the early Bronze Age. Corded Ware culture encompassed a vast area, from the contact zone between the Yamnaya culture and the Corded Ware culture in south Central Europe, to the Rhine in the west and the Volga in the east, occupying parts of Northern Europe, Central Europe and Eastern Europe. Autosomal genetic studies suggest that the Corded Ware culture originated from the westward migration of Yamnaya-related people from the steppe-forest zone into the territory of late Neolithic European cultures, evolving in parallel with (although under significant influence from) the Yamnaya; while the idea of direct male-line descent between them has not received significant support yet, IBD-sharing between the populations of these two cultures indicates that, at the very least, they came from a recent common ancestor, with a &quot;Harvard Magazine&quot; article on the find referring to them as &quot;cousins&quot; who were &quot;biologically separated ... by only a few hundred years&quot;.

The Corded Ware culture is considered to be a likely vector for the spread of many of the Indo-European languages in Europe and Asia.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;Corded Ware culture&quot; () was first introduced by the German archaeologist Friedrich Klopfleisch in 1883. He named it after &quot;cord-like&quot; impressions or ornamentation characteristic of its pottery. The term Single Grave culture comes from its burial custom, which consisted of inhumation under tumuli in a crouched position with various artifacts. Battle Axe culture, or Boat Axe culture, is named from its characteristic male grave offering, a stone boat-shaped battle axe.

==Geography==
Corded Ware encompassed most of continental northern Europe from the Rhine in the west to the Volga in the east, including most of modern-day Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Switzerland, northwestern Romania, northern Ukraine, and the European part of Russia, as well as coastal Norway and the southern portions of Sweden and Finland. In the Late Eneolithic/Early Bronze Age, it encompassed the territory of nearly the entire Balkan Peninsula, where Corded Ware mixed with other steppe elements.

Archaeologists note that Corded Ware was not a &quot;unified culture,&quot; as Corded Ware groups inhabiting a vast geographical area from the Rhine to Volga seem to have regionally specific subsistence strategies and economies. There are differences in the material culture and in settlements and society. At the same time, they had several shared elements that are characteristic of all Corded Ware groups, such as their burial practices, pottery with &quot;cord&quot; decoration and unique stone-axes.

The contemporary Bell Beaker culture overlapped with the western extremity of this culture, west of the Elbe, and may have contributed to the pan-European spread of that culture. Although a similar social organization and settlement pattern to the Beaker were adopted, the Corded Ware group lacked the new refinements made possible through trade and communication by sea and rivers.

===Origins===

The origins and dispersal of Corded Ware culture is one of the pivotal unresolved issues of the Indo-European Urheimat problem, and there is a stark division between archaeologists regarding the origins of Corded Ware. The Corded Ware culture has long been regarded as Indo-European, with archaeologists seeing an influence from nomadic pastoral societies of the steppes. Alternatively, some archaeologists believed it developed independently in central Europe.

====Relation with Yamnaya culture====

The Corded Ware culture was once presumed to be the Urheimat of the Proto-Indo-Europeans based on their possession of the horse and wheeled vehicles, apparent warlike propensities, wide area of distribution and rapid intrusive expansion at the assumed time of the dispersal of Indo-European languages. Today this specific idea has lost currency, as the steppe hypothesis is currently the most widely accepted proposal to explain the origins and spread of the Indo-European languages.

Autosomal genetic studies suggest that the people of the Corded Ware culture share significant levels of ancestry with Yamnaya as a consequence of a &quot;massive migration&quot; from the Pontic-Caspian steppe, and the people of both cultures may be directly descended from a genetically similar pre-Yamnaya population.

Kristiansen et al. (2017) theorise that the Corded Ware culture originated from male Yamnaya pastoralists who migrated northward and mated with women from farming communities. However, Barry Cunliffe has criticized the theory that the Corded Ware populations were descended from a mass migration of Yamnaya males, noting that the available Corded Ware samples do not carry paternal haplogroups observed in Yamnaya male specimens. This view is shared by Leo Klejn, who maintains that &quot;the Yamnaya cannot be the source of the Corded Ware cultures&quot;, as the Corded Ware paternal haplogroups are unrelated to those found in Yamnaya specimens. Similarly, Guus Kroonen et al. (2022), had argued that the Corded Ware populations may have originated from a Yamnaya-related population, rather than the Yamnaya themself, stating that &quot;this may support a scenario of linguistic continuity of local non-mobile herders in the Lower Dnieper region and their genetic persistence after their integration into the successive and expansive Yamnaya horizon&quot;.

In 2023, Kristiansen et al. argued that the lack of Yamnaya-related haplogroups in Corded Ware populations indicates that they cannot have been direct male-line descendants of the Yamnaya, as the Corded Ware culture samples were primarily from haplogroup R1a. These authors proposed that the Corded Ware culture evolved in parallel with (although under significant influence from) the Yamnaya, with direct male-line descent between them. However, Papac et al. (2023) revealed the presence of the most commonly sampled Corded Ware haplogroup in the Yamnaya, and Lazaridis et al. (2024) showed the presence of the most commonly sampled Yamnaya haplogroup in the Corded Ware.

Archaeologists Furholt and Heyd continue to emphasize the differences both between and within the material cultures of these two groups, as well as emphasizing the problems of oversimplifying these long-term social processes.

The Middle Dnieper culture forms a bridge between the Yamnaya culture and the Corded Ware culture. From the Middle Dnieper culture the Corded Ware culture spread both west and east. The eastward migration gave rise to the Fatyanova culture which had a formative influence on the Abashevo culture, which in turn contributed to the proto-Indo-Iranian Sintashta culture. Its wide area of distribution indicates rapid expansion at the assumed time of the dispersal of the core (excluding Anatolian and Tocharian) Indo-European languages. In a number of regions Corded Ware appears to herald a new culture and physical type. On most of the immense, continental expanse that it covered, the culture was clearly intrusive, and therefore represents one of the most impressive and revolutionary cultural changes attested by archaeology.

Early Corded Ware metallurgy is thought to have developed from the earlier copper metallurgy of the East-Carpathian Cucuteni-Trypillia culture with some additional Eastern Mediterranean influences.

====Independent development====

In favour of the view that the culture developed independently was the fact that Corded Ware coincides considerably with the earlier north-central European Funnelbeaker culture (TRB). According to Gimbutas, the Corded Ware culture was preceded by the Globular Amphora culture (3400–2800 BC), which she regarded to be an Indo-European culture. The Globular Amphora culture stretched from central Europe to the Baltic sea, and emerged from the Funnelbeaker culture.

According to controversial radiocarbon dates, Corded Ware ceramic forms in single graves develop earlier in the area that is now Poland than in western and southern Central Europe. The earliest radiocarbon dates for Corded Ware indeed come from Kujawy and Lesser Poland in central and southern Poland and point to the period around 3000 BC.

However, subsequent review has challenged this perspective, instead pointing out that the wide variation in dating of the Corded Ware, especially the dating of the culture&#x27;s beginning, is based on individual outlier graves, is not particularly in line with other archaeological data and runs afoul of plateaus in the radiocarbon calibration curve; in the one case where the dating can be clarified with dendrochronology, in Switzerland, Corded Ware is found for only a short period from 2750 BC to 2400 BC. Furthermore, because the short period in Switzerland seems to represent examples of artifacts from all the major sub-periods of the Corded Ware culture elsewhere, some researchers conclude that Corded Ware appeared more or less simultaneously throughout North Central Europe approximately in the early 29th century BC (around 2900 BC), in a number of &quot;centers&quot; which subsequently formed their own local networks. Carbon-14 dating of the remaining central European regions shows that Corded Ware appeared after 2880 BC. According to this theory, it spread to the Lüneburg Heath and then further to the North European Plain, Rhineland, Switzerland, Scandinavia, the Baltic region and Russia to Moscow, where the culture met with the pastoralists considered indigenous to the steppes.

===Subgroups===

====Middle Dnieper culture====
The Middle Dnieper culture is a formative early expression of the Corded Ware culture. It has very scant remains, but occupies the easiest route into Central and Northern Europe from the steppe.

====Fatyanovo–Balanovo culture====


The Middle Dnieper culture and the Eastern Baltic Corded Ware culture gave rise to the Fatyanovo–Balanovo culture on the upper Volga, which in turn contributed to the Abashevo culture, a predecessor of the proto-Indo-Iranian Sintashta culture.

The Fatyanovo–Balanovo culture may have been a culture with an Indo-European superstratum over a Uralic substratum, and may account for some of the linguistic borrowings identified in the Indo-Uralic thesis. However, according to Häkkinen, the Uralic–Indo-European contacts only start in the Corded Ware period and the Uralic expansion into the Upper Volga region postdates it. Häkkinen accepts Fatyanovo-Balanovo as an early Indo-European culture, but maintains that their substratum (identified with the Volosovo culture) was neither Uralic nor Indo-European.

====&quot;Schnurkeramikkultur&quot;====
The prototypal Corded Ware culture, German &quot;Schnurkeramikkultur&quot;, is found in Central Europe, mainly Germany and Poland, and refers to the characteristic pottery of the era: twisted cord was impressed into the wet clay to create various decorative patterns and motifs. It is known mostly from its burials, and both sexes received the characteristic cord-decorated pottery. Whether made of flax or hemp, they had rope.

====Single Grave culture====

Single Grave term refers to a series of late Neolithic communities of the 3rd millennium BC living in southern Scandinavia, Northern Germany, and the Low Countries that share the practice of single burial, the deceased usually being accompanied by a battle-axe, amber beads, and pottery vessels.

The term &quot;Single Grave culture&quot; was first introduced by the Danish archaeologist Andreas Peter Madsen in the late 1800s. He found Single Graves to be quite different from the already known dolmens, long barrows and passage graves. In 1898, archaeologist Sophus Müller was first to present a migration-hypothesis stating that previously known dolmens, long barrows, passage graves and newly discovered single graves may represent two completely different groups of people, stating &quot;Single graves are traces of new, from the south coming tribes&quot;.

The cultural emphasis on drinking equipment already characteristic of the early indigenous Funnelbeaker culture, synthesized with newly arrived Corded Ware traditions. Especially in the west (Scandinavia and northern Germany), the drinking vessels have a protruding foot and define the Protruding-Foot Beaker culture (PFB) as a subset of the Single Grave culture. The Beaker culture has been proposed to derive from this specific branch of the Corded Ware culture.

At Zeewijk in the Netherlands the remains of a large rectangular building measuring 22m by 5.5-7m, have been excavated. The building may have had a ritual or ceremonial function.

====Scandinavian Battle Axe culture====
The Danish-Swedish-Norwegian Battle Axe culture, or the Boat Axe culture, appeared and is known from about 3,000 graves from Scania to Uppland and Trøndelag. The &quot;battle-axes&quot; were primarily a status object. There are strong continuities in stone craft traditions, and very little evidence of any type of full-scale migration, least of all a violent one. The old ways were discontinued as the corresponding cultures on the continent changed, and the farmers living in Scandinavia took part in a few of those changes since they belonged to the same network. Settlements on small, separate farmsteads without any defensive protection is also a strong argument against the people living there being aggressors.

About 3000 battle axes have been found, in sites distributed over all of Scandinavia, but they are sparse in Norrland and northern Norway. Less than 100 settlements are known, and their remains are negligible as they are located on continually used farmland, and have consequently been plowed away. Einar Østmo reports sites inside the Arctic Circle in the Lofoten, and as far north as the present city of Tromsø.

The Swedish-Norwegian Battle Axe culture was based on the same agricultural practices as the previous Funnelbeaker culture, but the appearance of metal changed the social system. This is marked by the fact that the Funnelbeaker culture had collective megalithic graves with a great deal of sacrifices to the graves, but the Battle Axe culture has individual graves with individual sacrifices.

A new aspect was given to the culture in 1993, when a &quot;death house&quot; in Turinge, in Södermanland, was excavated. Along the once heavily timbered walls were found the remains of about twenty clay vessels, six work axes and a battle axe, which all came from the last period of the culture. There were also the cremated remains of at least six people. This is the earliest find of cremation in Scandinavia and it shows close contacts with Central Europe.

In the context of the entry of Germanic into the region, Einar Østmo emphasizes that the Atlantic and North Sea coastal regions of Scandinavia, and the circum-Baltic areas were united by a vigorous maritime economy, permitting a far wider geographical spread and a closer cultural unity than interior continental cultures could attain. He points to the widely disseminated number of rock carvings assigned to this era, which display &quot;thousands&quot; of ships. To seafaring cultures like this one, the sea is a highway and not a divider.

====Finnish Battle Axe culture====
The Finnish Battle Axe culture was a mixed cattle-breeder and hunter-gatherer culture, and one of the few in this horizon to provide rich finds from settlements.

==Economy==
There are very few discovered settlements, which led to the traditional view of this culture as exclusively nomadic pastoralists, similar to that of the Yamnaya culture, and the reconstructed culture of the Indo-Europeans as inferred from philology.

However, this view was modified, as some evidence of sedentary farming emerged. Traces of emmer, common wheat and barley were found at a Corded Ware site at Bronocice in south-east Poland. Wheeled vehicles (presumably drawn by oxen) are in evidence, a continuation from the Funnelbeaker culture era.

Cows&#x27; milk was used systematically from 3400 BC onwards in the northern Alpine foreland. Sheep were kept more frequently in the western part of Switzerland due to the stronger Mediterranean influence. Changes in slaughter age and animal size are possibly evidence for sheep being kept for their wool at Corded Ware sites in this region.

==Graves==
Burial occurred in flat graves or below small tumuli in a flexed position; on the continent males lay on their right side, females on the left, with the faces of both oriented to the south. However, in Sweden and also parts of northern Poland the graves were oriented north-south, men lay on their left side and women on the right side - both facing east. Originally, there was probably a wooden construction, since the graves are often positioned in a line. This is in contrast with practices in Denmark where the dead were buried below small mounds with a vertical stratigraphy: the oldest below the ground, the second above this grave, and occasionally even a third burial above those. Other types of burials are the niche-graves of Poland. Grave goods for men typically included a stone battle axe. Pottery in the shape of beakers and other types are the most common burial gifts, generally speaking. These were often decorated with cord, sometimes with incisions and other types of impressions. Other grave goods also included wagons and sacrificed animals.

The approximately contemporary Beaker culture had similar burial traditions, and together they covered most of Western and Central Europe. The Beaker culture originated around 2800 BC in the Iberian Peninsula and subsequently extended into Central Europe, where it partly coexisted with the Corded Ware region.

In April 2011, it was reported that an untypical Corded Ware burial had been discovered in a suburb of Prague. The remains, believed to be male, were orientated in the same way as women&#x27;s burials and were not accompanied by any gender-specific grave goods. Based on this, and the importance usually attached to funeral rites by people from this period, the archaeologists suggested that this was unlikely to be accidental, and conclude that it was likely that this individual &quot;was a man with a different sexual orientation, homosexual or transsexual&quot;, while media reports heralded the discovery of the world&#x27;s first &quot;gay caveman&quot;. Archaeologists and biological anthropologists criticised media coverage as sensationalist. &quot;If this burial represents a transgendered individual (as well it could), that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean the person had a &#x27;different sexual orientation&#x27; and certainly doesn&#x27;t mean that he would have considered himself (or that his culture would have considered him) &#x27;homosexual,&#x27;&quot; anthropologist Kristina Killgrove commented. Other items of criticism were that someone buried in the Copper Age was not a &quot;caveman&quot; and that identifying the sex of skeletal remains is difficult and inexact. Turek notes that there are several examples of Corded Ware graves containing older biological males with typically female grave goods and body orientation. He suggests that &quot;aged men may have decided to &#x27;retire&#x27; as women for symbolic and practical reasons.&quot; A detailed account of the burial has not yet appeared in 
scientific literature.

==Theories regarding linguistic identity==

===Spread of Indo-European languages===
The Corded Ware culture may have played a central role in the spread of the Indo-European languages in Europe during the Copper and Bronze Ages. It
had often been suggested that the CWC represented the geolinguistic core of the Indo-European languages subsequent to the divergence of first the Anatolian and Tocharian languages and later a group ancestral to the Indo-Iranian, Greek, Armenian, Illyrian and/or Thracian languages; such models implied the CWC spoke a language ancestral to the Italo-Celtic, Germanic, and Balto-Slavic languages. According to Mallory (1999), the Corded Ware culture may have been &quot;the common prehistoric ancestor of the later Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, Slavic, and possibly some of the Indo-European languages of Italy.&quot; Mallory (1999) also suggests that Corded Ware could not have been the sole source for Greek, Illyrian, Thracian and East Italic, which may be derived from Southeast Europe. 
Mallory (2013) proposes that the Beaker culture was associated with a European branch of Indo-European dialects, termed &quot;North-West Indo-European&quot;, spreading northwards from the Alpine regions and ancestral to not only Celtic but equally Italic, Germanic and Balto-Slavic.

According to Anthony (2007), the Corded Ware horizon may have introduced Germanic, Baltic and Slavic into northern Europe. According to Anthony, the Pre-Germanic dialects may have developed in the Usatovo culture in south-eastern Central Europe between the Dniestr and the Vistula between c. 3100 and 2800 BC, and spread with the Corded Ware culture. Between 3100 and 2800/2600 BC, a real folk migration of Proto-Indo-European speakers from the Yamnaya culture took place into the Danube Valley, which eventually reached as far as Hungary, where pre-Celtic and pre-Italic may have developed. Slavic and Baltic developed at the middle Dniepr (present-day Ukraine).

Haak et al. (2015) envision a migration from the Yamnaya culture into Germany. Allentoft et al. (2015) envision a migration from the Yamnaya culture towards north-western Europe via Central Europe, and towards the Baltic area and the eastern periphery of the Corded Ware culture via the territory of present-day Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.

===Theoretical explanation: language shift===
According to Gimbutas&#x27; original theory, the process of &quot;Indo-Europeanization&quot; of Corded Ware (and, later, the rest of Europe) was essentially a cultural transformation, not a genetic one. The Yamnaya migration from Eastern to Central and Western Europe is understood by Gimbutas as a military victory, resulting in the Yamnaya imposing a new administrative system, language and religion upon the indigenous groups.

David Anthony (2007), in his &quot;revised Steppe hypothesis&quot;, proposes that the spread of the Indo-European languages probably did not happen through &quot;chain-type folk migrations,&quot; but by the introduction of these languages by ritual and political elites, which were emulated by large groups of people, a process which he calls &quot;elite recruitment&quot;. Yet, in supplementary information to Haak et al. (2015), Anthony, together with Lazaridis, Haak, Patterson, and Reich, note that the mass migration of Yamnaya people to northern Europe shows that &quot;the Steppe hypothesis does not require elite dominance to have transmitted Indo-European languages into Europe. Instead, our results show that the languages could have been introduced simply by strength of numbers: via major migration in which both sexes participated.&quot;

Linguist Guus Kroonen points out that speakers of Indo-European languages encountered existing populations in Europe that spoke unrelated, non-Indo-European languages when they migrated further into Europe from the Yamnaya culture&#x27;s steppe zone at the margin of Europe. He focuses on both the effects on Indo-European languages that resulted from this contact and investigation of the pre-existing languages. Relatively little is known about the Pre-Indo-European linguistic landscape of Europe, except for Basque, as the &quot;Indo-Europeanization&quot; of Europe caused a massive and largely unrecorded linguistic extinction event, most likely through language shift. Kroonen&#x27;s 2015 study claims to show that Pre-Indo-European speech contains a clear Neolithic signature emanating from the Aegean language family and thus patterns with the prehistoric migration of Europe’s first farming populations.

Marija Gimbutas, as part of her theory, had already inferred that the Corded Ware culture&#x27;s intrusion into Scandinavia formed a synthesis with the indigenous people of the Funnelbeaker culture, giving birth to the Proto-Germanic language. According to Edgar Polomé, 30% of the non-Indo-European substratum found in the modern German language derives from non-Indo-European-speakers of Funnelbeaker culture, indigenous to southern Scandinavia. She claimed that when Yamnaya Indo-European speakers came into contact with the indigenous peoples during the 3rd millennium BC, they came to dominate the local populations yet parts of the indigenous lexicon persisted in the formation of Proto-Germanic, thus giving Proto-Germanic the status of being an &quot;Indo-Europeanized&quot; language. However, more recent linguists have substantially reduced the number of roots claimed to be uniquely Germanic, and more recent treatments of Proto-Germanic tend to reject or simply omit discussion of the Germanic substrate hypothesis, giving little reason to consider Germanic anything but a typical Indo-European dialect with at most minor substrate influence.

==Genetic studies==
===Relation with Yamnaya-culture===
 found that a large proportion of the ancestry of the Corded Ware culture&#x27;s population is similar to that of the Yamnaya culture, tracing the Corded Ware culture&#x27;s origins to a &quot;massive migration&quot; of the Yamnaya or an earlier (pre-Yamnaya) population from the steppes 4,500 years ago. The DNA of late Neolithic Corded Ware skeletons found in Germany was found to be around 75% similar to DNA from individuals of the Yamnaya culture. Yet, Haak et al. (2015) warned:
The same study estimated a 40–54% ancestral contribution of so-called &quot;steppe ancestry&quot; in the DNA of modern Central &amp; Northern Europeans, and a 20–32% contribution in modern Southern Europeans, excluding Sardinians (7.1% or less), and to a lesser extent Sicilians (11.6% or less). Haak et al. (2015) further found that autosomal DNA tests indicate that westward migration from the steppes was responsible for the introduction of a component of ancestry referred to as &quot;Ancient North Eurasian&quot; admixture into western Europe. &quot;Ancient North Eurasian&quot; is the name given in genetic literature to a component that represents descent from the people of the Mal&#x27;ta-Buret&#x27; culture or a population closely related to them. The &quot;Ancient North Eurasian&quot; genetic component is visible in tests of the Yamnaya people as well as modern-day Europeans, but not of Western or Central Europeans predating the Corded Ware culture.
 has cautioned to be careful with drawing too strong conclusions from those genetic similarities between Corded Ware and Yamnaya, noting the small number of samples; the late dates of the Esperstadt graves, which could also have undergone Bell Beaker admixture; the presence of Yamnaya ancestry in western Europe before the Danube expansion; and the risks of extrapolating &quot;the results from a handful of individual burials to whole ethnically interpreted populations.&quot; Heyd confirms the close connection between Corded Ware and Yamnaya, but also states that &quot;neither a one-to-one translation from Yamnaya to CWC, nor even the 75:25 ratio as claimed (Haak &quot;et al.&quot; 2015:211) fits the archaeological record.&quot;

In the early 3rd millennium BC, the Corded Ware culture appeared in Northern Europe. Genetic studies suggest that Funnelbeaker women of European Neolithic farmer ancestry were incorporated into the Corded Ware culture through intermixing with incoming Corded Ware males of Yamnaya ancestry. Saag et al. (2017) found that the people of the Corded Ware culture in the eastern Baltic carried &quot;Steppe ancestry on the male side&quot; and &quot;some European early farmer genetic ancestry on the female side&quot;.

An archaeogenetic study focusing on late Neolithic and Bronze Age individuals from Bohemia, , which includes Haak and Heyd as co-authors, suggests that the early Corded Ware culture was a &quot;polyethnic&quot; society characterized by genetic, cultural, and linguistic diversity, resulting from the agglomeration of people of the Globular Amphora culture and Yamnaya-related migrants, who had highly differentiated genetic profiles, a different material culture, and probably spoke different languages. 100% of the Bohemian Corded Ware samples found without steppe-derived ancestry were female, indicating that this genetic diversity was a result of Corded Ware males marrying and assimilating local Globular Amphora females. Later Corded Ware individuals of Central Europe were less differentiated genetically. This study also detected ancestry similar to Latvia Middle Neolithic (&quot;Latvia_MN-like&quot;), or Ukraine Neolithic in early Corded Ware individuals, suggesting either a northeast European Eneolithic forest steppe contribution to early CW, partially supported by archaeology, or alternatively a contribution from a hypothetical steppe population carrying this ancestry, which the authors consider less likely. This ancestry made up 5-15% of the early Corded Ware ancestry, depending on the model used.

===Y-DNA===

====R1a and R1b====
According to Malmström et al. (2019), neither R1a nor R1b-M269 have been reported among Neolithic populations of central and western Europe, although they were common among earlier hunter gatherers of Eastern Europe. Haak et al. note that their results suggest that these haplogroups &quot;spread into Europe from the East after 3,000 BC.&quot;
The majority of CWC-men carried haplogroup R1a-M417, the remaining ones R1b and I2a. Note that, although related to the Corded Ware population, Yamnaya males mainly carried R1b-Z2103, while R1b-bearing Corded Ware males had R1b-L51, suggesting that Corded Ware culture males cannot be directly patrilineally descended from Yamnaya individuals. Yet, Linderholm et al. (2020) found seven CW males which were narrowed down to either R1b-M269 or R-L11, while Allentoft et al. (2015) report two CW males with R1b, and Furtwängler et al. (2020) report three CW males with R1b. According to Sjögren et al. (2020), R1b-M269 &quot;is the major lineage associated with the arrival of Steppe ancestry in western Europe after 2500 BC[E].&quot;

Papac et al. (2021) argue that the differences in Y-DNA between early CW and Yamnaya males suggest that the Yamnaya culture did not have a direct role in the origins and expansion of the Corded Ware culture. They found that a majority of early Corded Ware males in Bohemia belonged to R1b-L151, while R1a lineages became predominant over time. The study detected a reduction in male haplogroup diversity over time, reducing from five different lineages in early CW to a single dominant lineage, R1a-M417(xZ645), in late CW. The authors suggest that males of this haplogroup had around 15% more surviving offspring per generation compared to other males, which may have been caused by &quot;selection, social structure, or influx of nonlocal R1a-M417(xZ645) lineages.&quot; The sample included one individual ancestral to haplogroup R1b-P312, which is the most common male lineage found in individuals of the Bell Beaker culture.

====Overview of reported CW Y-DNA haplogroups====

An overview of reported CW Y-DNA haplogroups:
* Haak et al. (2008): three males (probably a father and his two children) from a single Corded Ware burial in Eulau, Germany carrying R1a. 
* Haak et al. (2015): a Corded Ware male from Esperstedt carrying R1a1a1.
* Allentoft et al. (2015): several males from the Corded Ware culture. A male from the Battle-Axe culture in Viby, Kristianstad was found to be carrying R1a1a1. A Corded Ware male of Bergrheinfeld, Germany was also found to have carried R1a1a1. A Corded Ware male of Leki Male was found to have carried R1b1a. Two Corded Ware males from Tiefbrunn, Germany were found to have carried R1 and R1b1 respectively.
* Mathieson et al. (2015): eight Corded Ware males buried in Esperstedt. Six carried R1a or various subclades of it, while two carried R.
* Saag et al. (2017): five males from the Corded Ware culture in Estonia. Four of them carried R1a-Z645, while the other carried R1a1-Z283.
* Mathieson et al. (2018): three Corded Ware males from the Czech Republic. The three were found to be carrying the paternal haplogroups R1a1a, R1a1 and I2a2a2 respectively.
* Malmström et al. (2019): two Corded Ware males; both were found to be carriers of R1a.
* Linderholm et al. (2020) report seven Polish CW males with R1b.

===Relations with later cultures===
A 2015 study by Allentoft et al. in &quot;Nature&quot; found the people of the Corded Ware culture to be genetically similar to the Beaker culture, the Únětice culture and the Nordic Bronze Age. People of the Nordic Bronze Age and Corded Ware show the highest lactose tolerance among Bronze Age Europeans.

The study also found a close genetic relationship between the Corded Ware culture and the Sintashta culture, suggesting that the Sintashta culture emerged as a result of an eastward expansion of Corded Ware peoples. The Sintashta culture is in turn closely genetically related to the Andronovo culture, by which it was succeeded. Many cultural similarities between the Sintashta/Andronovo culture, the Nordic Bronze Age and the people of the Rigveda have been detected.

Narasimhan et al. (2019) found the Sintashta culture, the Potapovka culture, the Andronovo culture and the Srubnaya culture to be closely related to the Corded Ware culture. These cultures were found to harbor mixed ancestry from the Yamnaya culture and peoples of the Middle Neolithic of Central Europe. The genetic data suggested that these cultures were ultimately derived of a remigration of Central European peoples with steppe ancestry back into the steppe.

<doc id="189641" wikidata="Q1566430" url="?curid=189641" title="Jack Warner (actor)">
<text>Jack Warner (born Horace John Waters; 24 October 1895 – 24 May 1981) was a British actor. He is closely associated with the role of PC George Dixon, which he played in the 1950 film &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; and later in the television series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; from 1955 until 1976, but he was also for some years one of Britain&#x27;s most popular film stars. He also periodically released novelty records - comic songs or collections related to his Dixon role - for example his 1958 release &quot;An Ordinary Copper&quot; which was released by Oriole Records - and reissued twice afterward.

==Early life==
Warner was born Horace John Waters in Bromley-by-Bow, Poplar, London, the third child of Edward William Waters, master fulling maker and undertaker&#x27;s warehouseman, and Maud Mary Best. His sisters, Elsie and Doris Waters, were comediennes who usually performed as &quot;Gert and Daisy&quot;.

Warner attended the Coopers&#x27; Company&#x27;s Grammar School for Boys in Mile End, while his sisters both attended the nearby sister school, Coborn School for Girls in Bow. The three children were choristers at St. Leonard&#x27;s Church in Bromley-by-Bow, and for a time, Warner was the choir&#x27;s soloist.

After leaving school, he studied automobile engineering at the Northampton Institute (now part of the City University, London) but being more practical than academic he left after a year to work at the repair facilities of F.W. Berwick and Company in Balham, where he started by sweeping the floors for 2d per hour. Frederick William Berwick became a partner in the Anglo-French automobile manufacturing company Sizaire-Berwick and, in August 1913, Warner was sent to work as a mechanic in Paris. He drove completed chassis to the coast from where they were shipped to England, road-testing them &quot;en route&quot;. He acquired a working knowledge of French which stood him in good stead throughout his life; an imitation of Maurice Chevalier became a part of his repertoire.

During the First World War, he served in France as a driver in the Royal Flying Corps and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1918. He returned to England and the motor trade in 1919, graduating from hearses to occasional car racing at Brooklands, where he maintained and sometimes raced Henrietta Lister&#x27;s Aston Martin. He was over thirty before he became a professional entertainer.

==Career==
Warner first became known to the general public in music hall and radio. By the early years of the Second World War, he was nationally known and starred in a BBC radio comedy show, &quot;Garrison Theatre&quot;, invariably opening with &quot;A Monologue Entitled...&quot;.

==Film==
Warner&#x27;s first film was &quot;The Dummy Talks&quot; (1943), in which he had the lead role. He had a support role in &quot;The Captive Heart&quot; (1946), a successful film. Also successful were &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; and &quot;Dear Murderer&quot; (both 1947). Warner was the patriarch of the Huggett family in &quot;Holiday Camp&quot; (1947) which was a big hit. He played a policeman in &quot;It Always Rains on Sunday&quot; (1947), and was another family man in the comedy &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1948).

He was in a war film, &quot;Against the Wind&quot; (1948), and starred in a thriller, &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot; (1948). The Huggett family had been so well received in &quot;Holiday Camp&quot; that production company Gainsborough Pictures decided to give them their own series, so Warner was seen in &quot;Here Come the Huggetts&quot; (1948), &quot;Vote for Huggett&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Huggetts Abroad&quot; (1949). He was one of several names in &quot;Train of Events&quot; and played the governor of a borstal institution in &quot;Boys in Brown&quot; (both 1949).

Warner was by now established as one of the most popular British actors in the country. His stock rose further when he played PC George Dixon pursuing young hoodlum Dirk Bogarde in &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950), the most successful film at the box office that year. One observer predicted, &quot;This film will make Jack the most famous policeman in Britain.&quot;

Warner performed in a comedy &quot;Talk of a Million&quot; (1951) and a thriller &quot;Valley of Eagles&quot; (1951). He had a small part in &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1951) then played a policeman again in &quot;Emergency Call&quot; (1952). He was one of several stars in &quot;Meet Me Tonight&quot; (1952) and returned to comedy for &quot;Those People Next Door&quot; (1953). He was top-billed in &quot;The Square Ring&quot; and &quot;The Final Test&quot; (both 1953). In the POW film &quot;Albert R.N.&quot; (1953) he was billed beneath Anthony Steel.

Additional thrillers followed: &quot;Bang! You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (1954) and &quot;Forbidden Cargo&quot; (1954). He co-starred in the Hammer film version of &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot; (1955) and had a cameo-like supporting role as the police superintendent in the 1955 Ealing Studios black comedy &quot;The Ladykillers&quot;.

Even with his success that followed in television, Warner performed in the occasional film such as &quot;Now and Forever&quot; (1956), &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1956), &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot; (1958) and &quot;Jigsaw&quot; (1962). His last film appearance was in &quot;Dominique&quot; (1979).

==Television==

Warner was interviewed by Christopher Chataway for Panorama (British TV programme) in September, 1957, on which he was appearing as President of The Sunday Freedom Association, to advocate for the revision of UK law known as The Sunday Observance Act.

Although the police constable he played in &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; was shot dead in the film, the character was revived in 1955 for the BBC television series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, which ran until 1976. However, in the series&#x27; later years, Warner&#x27;s character became ridiculed, and the series no longer supported by the police, since Warner at 80 was so obviously well past compulsory retirement age, although supposedly confined to a less active desk sergeant role. The series had a prime-time slot on Saturday evenings, and always opened with Dixon giving a brief soliloquy to the camera, beginning with the words, &quot;Good evening, all&quot;. At the conclusion of the episode, Dixon would once again address the camera, this time reflecting on the previous events or describing what occurred afterwards. According to Warner&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot;, Queen Elizabeth II once visited the television studio where the series was made, and told Warner &quot;that she thought &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; had become part of the British way of life&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1933, Warner married company secretary Muriel Winifred (&quot;Mollie&quot;), daughter of independently wealthy Roberts Peters. The couple had no children.

Warner was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1965. In 1973, he was made a Freeman of the City of London. Warner commented in his autobiography that the honour &quot;entitles me to a set of 18th century rules for the conduct of life urging me to be sober and temperate&quot;. Warner added, &quot;Not too difficult with Dixon to keep an eye on me!&quot;

He died, aged 85, of pneumonia in the Royal Masonic Hospital, Ravenscourt Park, Hammersmith, London, in 1981. The characterisation by Warner of Dixon was held in such high regard that officers from Paddington Green Police Station bore the coffin at his funeral.

Acclaimed soprano Renée Fleming grew up in nearby Churchville. A number of nationally known musicians have passed through the halls of the Eastman School, either as students or professors (or both).

<doc id="189644" wikidata="Q208215" url="?curid=189644" title="Jacques de Molay">
<text>Jacques de Molay (; 1240–1250 – 11 or 18 March 1314), also spelled &quot;Molai&quot;, was the 23rd and last grand master of the Knights Templar, leading the order sometime before 20 April 1292 until it was dissolved by order of Pope Clement V in 1312. Though little is known of his actual life and deeds except for his last years as Grand Master, he is one of the best known Templars.

Jacques de Molay&#x27;s goal as grand master was to reform the order, and adjust it to the situation in the Holy Land during the waning days of the Crusades. As European support for the Crusades diminished, the French monarchy sought to disband the order and claim the wealth of the Templars as its own. King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the Templars, had Molay and many other French Templars arrested in 1307 and tortured into making false confessions. When Molay later retracted his confession, Philip had him burned upon a scaffold on an island in the River Seine in front of Notre-Dame de Paris in March, 1314. Both the sudden end of the centuries-old order of Templars and the dramatic execution of its last leader turned Molay into a legendary figure.

==Youth==

Little is known of his early years, but Jacques de Molay was probably born in Molay, Haute-Saône, in the County of Burgundy, at the time a territory ruled by Otto III as part of the Holy Roman Empire, and in modern times in the area of Franche-Comté, northeastern France. His birth year is not certain, but judging by statements made during the later trials, was probably around 1240–1250.

He was born, as most Templar knights were, into a family of minor or middle-ranking nobility. It is suggested that he was made a knight at age 21 in 1265 and is known that he was about 70 years of age at the time of his execution in 1314. His year of birth is not known and Alain Demurger finds it probable that he was born in the period 1244/45 to 1248/49 or even between 1240 and 1250.

In 1265, as a young man, he was received into the Order of the Templars in a chapel at the Beaune House, by Humbert de Pairaud, the Visitor of France and England. Another prominent Templar in attendance was Amaury de la Roche, Templar Master of the province of France.

Around 1270, de Molay went to the East (Outremer), although little is recorded of his activities for the next twenty years.

==Grand master==
After the Fall of Acre to the Egyptian Mamluks in 1291, the Franks (a name used in the Levant for Catholic Europeans) who were able to do so retreated to the island of Cyprus. It became the headquarters of the dwindling Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the Crusaders against the Egyptian Mamluks, who for their part were systematically conquering any last Crusader strongholds on the mainland. Templars in Cyprus included Jacques de Molay and Thibaud Gaudin, their 22nd grand master. During a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291, Molay spoke of reforming the Order and put himself forward as an alternative to the current grand master. Gaudin died around 1292 and, as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time, Molay was soon elected.

In spring 1293, he began a tour of the West to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the Holy Land. Developing relationships with European leaders such as Pope Boniface VIII, Edward I of England, James I of Aragon and Charles II of Naples, Molay&#x27;s immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of Cyprus and rebuild the Templar forces. From his travels, he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to Cyprus, but could obtain no firm commitment for a new Crusade. There was talk of merging the Templars with one of the other military orders, the Knights Hospitaller. The grand masters of both orders opposed such a merger, but pressure increased from the Papacy.

It is known that Molay held two general meetings of his order in southern France, at Montpellier in 1293 and at Arles in 1296, where he tried to make reforms. In the autumn of 1296, Molay was back in Cyprus to defend his Order against the interests of Henry II of Cyprus, which conflict had its roots back in the days of Guillaume de Beaujeu.

From 1299 to 1303, Molay was engaged in planning and executing a new attack against the Mamluks. The plan was to coordinate actions between the Christian military orders, the King of Cyprus, the nobility of Cyprus, the forces of Cilician Armenia, and a new potential ally, the Mongols of the Ilkhanate (Persia), to oppose the Egyptian Mamluks and take back the coastal city of Tortosa in Syria.

For generations, there had been communications between the Mongols and Europeans towards the possibility of forging a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Mamluks, but without success. The Mongols had been repeatedly attempting to conquer Syria themselves, each time either being forced back by the Egyptian Mamluks or having to retreat because of a civil war within the Mongol Empire, such as having to defend from attacks from the Mongol Golden Horde to the north. In 1299, the Ilkhanate again attempted to conquer Syria, having some preliminary success against the Mamluks in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar in December 1299.

In 1300, Molay and other forces from Cyprus put together a small fleet of sixteen ships which committed raids along the Egyptian and Syrian coasts. The force was commanded by King Henry II of Jerusalem, the king of Cyprus, accompanied by his brother, Amalric, Lord of Tyre, and the heads of the military orders, with the ambassador of the Mongol leader Ghazan also in attendance. The ships left Famagusta on 20 July 1300, and under the leadership of Admiral Baudouin de Picquigny, raided the coasts of Egypt and Syria: Rosetta, Alexandria, Acre, Tortosa and Maraclea, before returning to Cyprus.

The Cypriots then prepared for an attack on Tortosa in late 1300, sending a joint force to a staging area on the island of Ruad, from which raids were launched on the mainland. The intent was to establish a Templar bridgehead to await assistance from Ghazan&#x27;s Mongols, but the Mongols failed to appear in 1300. The same happened in 1301 and 1302, and the island was finally lost in the Siege of Ruad on 26 September 1302, eliminating the Crusaders&#x27; last foothold near the mainland.

Following the loss of Ruad, Molay abandoned the tactic of small advance forces, and instead put his energies into trying to raise support for a new major Crusade, as well as strengthening Templar authority in Cyprus. When a power struggle erupted between King Henry II and his brother Amalric, the Templars supported Amalric, who took the crown and had his brother exiled in 1306. Meanwhile, pressure increased in Europe that the Templars should be merged with the other military orders, perhaps all placed under the authority of one king, and that individual should become the new King of Jerusalem when it was conquered.

===Travel to France===
In 1305, the newly elected Pope Clement V asked the leaders of the military orders for their opinions concerning a new crusade and the merging of their orders. Molay was asked to write memoranda on each of the issues, which he did during the summer of 1306. Molay was opposed to the merger, believing instead that having separate military orders was a stronger position, as the missions of each order were somewhat different. He was also of the belief that if there were to be a new crusade, it needed to be a large one, as the smaller attempts were not effective.

On 6 June 1306, the leaders of both the Templars and the Hospitallers were officially asked to come to the Papal offices in Poitiers to discuss these matters, with the date of the meeting scheduled as All Saints Day (1 November) in 1306, though it later had to be postponed due to the Pope&#x27;s illness with gastro-enteritis. Molay left Cyprus on 15 October 1306, arriving in France in late 1306 or early 1307; however, the meeting was again delayed until late May due to the Pope&#x27;s illness.

King Philip IV of France, deeply in debt to the Templars, was in favor of merging the Orders under his own command, thereby making himself &quot;Rex Bellator&quot;, or War King. Molay, however, rejected the idea. Philip was already at odds with the papacy, trying to tax the clergy, and had been attempting to assert his own authority as higher than that of the Pope. For this, one of Clement&#x27;s predecessors, Pope Boniface VIII, had attempted to have Philip excommunicated, but Philip then had Boniface abducted and charged with heresy. The elderly Boniface was rescued, but then died of shock shortly thereafter. His successor Pope Benedict XI did not last long, dying in less than a year, possibly poisoned via Philip&#x27;s councillor Guillaume de Nogaret. It took a year to choose the next Pope, the Frenchman Clement V, who was also under strong pressure to bend to Philip&#x27;s will. Clement moved the Papacy from Italy to Poitiers, France, where Philip continued to assert more dominance over the Papacy and the Templars.

The Grand Master of the Hospitallers, Fulk de Villaret, was also delayed in his travel to France, as he was engaged with a battle at Rhodes. He did not arrive until late summer, so while waiting for his arrival, Molay met the Pope to discuss other matters, one of which was the charges by one or more ousted Templars who had made accusations of impropriety in the Templars&#x27; initiation ceremony. Molay had already spoken with the king in Paris on 24 June 1307 about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured. Returning to Poitiers, Molay asked the Pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the Order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it, and the Pope convened an inquiry on 24 August 1307.

==Arrest and charges==
There were five initial charges lodged against the Templars. The first was renunciation of and spitting on the cross during initiation into the Order. The second was the stripping of the man to be initiated and the thrice kissing of that man by the preceptor on the navel, posterior and mouth. The third was telling the neophyte (novice) that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly. The fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was consecrated by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard, and that this idol was adored in all chapters. The fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating Mass. Subsequently, the charges would be increased and would become, according to the procedures, lists of articles 86 to 127[3] in which will be added a few other charges, such as the prohibition to priests who do not belong to the order.

Philip wanted the Templars arrested and their possessions confiscated to incorporate their wealth into the Royal Treasury and to be free of the enormous debt he owed the Templar Order. On 14 September, Philip took advantage of the rumors and inquiry to begin his move against the Templars, sending out a secret order to his agents in all parts of France to implement a mass arrest of all Templars at dawn on 13 October. Molay was in Paris on 12 October, where he was a pallbearer at the funeral of Catherine of Courtenay, wife of Count Charles of Valois, and sister-in-law of King Philip. In a dawn raid on Friday, 13 October 1307, Molay and all the Templars of the central house of Paris were arrested. Philip then had the Templars charged with heresy and many other trumped-up charges, most of which were identical to the charges which had previously been leveled by Philip&#x27;s agents against Pope Boniface VIII.

During forced interrogation by royal agents at the University of Paris on 24, and 25 October, Molay confessed that the Templar initiation ritual included &quot;denying Christ and trampling on the Cross&quot;. He was also forced to write a letter asking every Templar to admit to these acts. Under pressure from Philip IV, Pope Clement V ordered the arrest of all the Templars throughout Christendom.

The pope still wanted to hear Molay&#x27;s side of the story, and dispatched two cardinals to Paris in December 1307. In front of the cardinals, Molay retracted his earlier confessions. A power struggle ensued between the king and the pope, which was settled in August 1308 when they agreed to split the convictions. Through the papal bull &quot;Faciens misericordiam&quot;, the procedure to prosecute the Templars was set out on a duality, whereby one commission would judge individuals of the Order and a different commission would judge the Order as a whole. Pope Clement called for an ecumenical council to meet in Vienne in 1310 to decide the future of the Templars. In the meantime, the Order&#x27;s dignitaries, among them Molay, were to be judged by the pope.

In the royal palace at Chinon, Molay was again questioned by the cardinals, but this time with royal agents present, and he returned to his forced admissions made in 1307. In November 1309, the Papal Commission for the Kingdom of France began its own hearings, during which Molay again recanted, stating that he did not acknowledge the accusations brought against his order.

Any further opposition by the Templars was effectively broken when Philip used the previously forced confessions to sentence 54 Templars to be burnt at the stake between 10 May and 12 May 1310.

The council which had been called by the Pope for 1310 was delayed for a further two years due to the length of the trials, but was finally convened in 1312. On 22 March 1312, at the Council of Vienne, the Order of the Knights Templar was abolished by papal decree.

==Death==

Molay was sentenced to death together with Geoffroi de Charney in 1314 as a direct result of cardinal legates&#x27; decisions and actions rather than being ordered by King Philip the Fair. He was burned at the stake on the Ile des Javiaux in the Seine. The most probable date of the execution was according to Alain Demurger and others 11 March 1314 although it is also quoted as 18 March 1314.

Of Molay&#x27;s death, Henry Charles Lea gives this account: 

===Chinon Parchment===
In September 2001, Barbara Frale found a copy of the Chinon Parchment in the Vatican Secret Archives, a document which explicitly confirms that in 1308 Pope Clement V absolved Jacques de Molay and other leaders of the Order including Geoffroi de Charney and Hugues de Pairaud. She published her findings in the &quot;Journal of Medieval History&quot; in 2004. Another Chinon parchment dated 20 August 1308 addressed to Philip IV of France, well known to historians, stated that absolution had been granted to all those Templars that had confessed to heresy &quot;and restored them to the Sacraments and to the unity of the Church&quot;.

==Legends==
The sudden arrest of the Templars, the conflicting stories about confessions, and the dramatic deaths by burning, generated many stories and legends about both the Order, and its last Grand Master.

===Conquest of Jerusalem===
In France in the 19th century, false stories circulated that Molay had captured Jerusalem in 1300. These rumors are probably related to the fact that the medieval historian the Templar of Tyre wrote about a Mongol general named &quot;Mulay&quot; who occupied Syria and Palestine for a few months in early 1300. The Mongol Mulay and the Templar Molay were entirely different people, but some historians regularly confused the two.

The confusion was enhanced in 1805, when the French playwright and historian François Raynouard made claims that Jerusalem had been captured by the Mongols, with Molay in command of one of the Mongol divisions. &quot;In 1299, the Grand-Master was with his knights at the recapture of Jerusalem.&quot; This story of wishful thinking was so popular in France that in 1846 a large-scale painting was created by Claude Jacquand, titled &quot;Molay Prend Jerusalem, 1299&quot; (&quot;Molay Takes Jerusalem, 1299&quot;), which depicts the supposed event. Today the painting hangs in the Hall of the Crusades in the French national museum of Versailles.

In the 1861 edition of the French encyclopedia, the &quot;Nouvelle Biographie Universelle&quot;, it even lists Molay as a Mongol commander in its &quot;Molay&quot; article:

Modern historians, however, state that the truth of the matter is this: There are indeed numerous ancient records of Mongol raids and occupations of Jerusalem (from Western, Armenian, or Arab sources), and in 1300 the Mongols did achieve a brief victory in Syria which caused a Muslim retreat, and allowed the Mongols to launch raids into the Levant as far as Gaza for a period of a few months. During that year, rumors flew through Europe that the Mongols had recaptured Jerusalem and were going to return the city to the Europeans. However, this was only an urban legend, as the only activities that the Mongols had even engaged in were some minor raids through Palestine, which may or may not have even passed through Jerusalem itself. Regardless of what the Mongols may or may not have done, there is no evidence that Molay was ever a Mongol commander, and he probably never set foot in Jerusalem.

===Curse===
It has been claimed that Jacques de Molay cursed King Philip IV of France and his descendants from his execution pyre. However, the story of the shouted curse appears to be a combination of words by a different Templar, and those of Molay. An eyewitness to the execution stated that Molay had shown no sign of fear and had told those present that God would avenge their deaths. Another variation on this story was told by the contemporary chronicler Ferreto of Vicenza, who applied the idea to a Neapolitan Templar brought before Clement V, whom he denounced for his injustice. Some time later, as he was about to be executed, he appealed &quot;from this your heinous judgement to the living and true God, who is in Heaven&quot;, warning the Pope that, within a year and a day, he and Philip IV would be obliged to answer for their crimes in God&#x27;s presence.

Philip and Clement V both died within a year of Molay&#x27;s execution; Clement succumbed to a long illness on 20 April 1314, and Philip died due to a stroke while hunting. Then followed the rapid succession of the last Direct Capetian kings of France between 1314 and 1328, the three sons and a grandson of Philip IV. Within fourteen years of the death of Molay, the 300-year-old House of Capet collapsed. This series of events forms the basis of &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of historical novels written by Maurice Druon between 1955 and 1977, which was also adapted into two French television miniseries in 1972 and 2005.

The American historian Henry Charles Lea wrote: &quot;Even in distant Germany Philippe&#x27;s death was spoken of as a retribution for his destruction of the Templars, and Clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his death-bed for three great crimes, the poisoning of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, and the ruin of the Templars and Beguines&quot;.

===Freemasonry===
Some 400 years after the death of de Molay and the dissolution of the Knights Templar, the fraternal order of Freemasonry began to emerge in northern Europe. The Masons developed an elaborate mythos about their Order, and some claimed heritage from entities in history, ranging from the mystique of the Templars to the builders of Solomon&#x27;s Temple. The stories of the Templars&#x27; secret initiation ceremonies also proved a tempting source for Masonic writers who were creating new works of pseudohistory. As described by modern historian Malcolm Barber in &quot;The New Knighthood&quot;: &quot;It was during the 1760s that German masons introduced a specific Templar connection, claiming that the Order, through its occupation of the Temple of Solomon, had been the repository of secret wisdom and magical powers, which Jacques DeMolay had handed down to his successor before his execution and of which the eighteenth-century Freemasons were the direct heirs.&quot;

The modern Masonic &quot;Knights Templar&quot; is an international philanthropic and chivalric order affiliated with Freemasonry, and begun in Ireland perhaps as long ago as 1780. Unlike the initial degrees conferred in a Masonic Lodge, which only require a belief in a Supreme Being regardless of religious affiliation, the Knights Templar is one of several additional Masonic Orders in which membership is open only to Freemasons who profess a belief in the Christian religion. The full title of this Order is &quot;The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta&quot;.

The story of de Molay&#x27;s brave defiance of his inquisitors has been incorporated in various forms into Masonic lore; most notably in the form of a youth group for young men aged 12 to 21, sponsored by Freemasonry, and named after the last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. DeMolay International, also known as &quot;The Order of DeMolay,&quot; was founded in Kansas City in 1919 by Freemason Frank S. Land. Similar to what happens in Freemasonry, new members are ceremoniously initiated using &quot;degrees&quot; that are part of the Order&#x27;s secret ritual, authored, in the case of the Order of DeMolay&#x27;s ritual, by Frank A. Marshall at founder Land&#x27;s request in 1919. The first, and less dramatic, of the two degrees is called &quot;the Initiatory Degree&quot;, wherein initiates are escorted around the meeting room and instructed in the precepts and &quot;Seven Cardinal Virtues&quot; of the Order. The second of the two degrees, known as &quot;the DeMolay Degree,&quot; which, along with the Initiatory Degree, members and observers are sworn to keep secret, dramatically recreates the trial, &quot;before a Commission in its Council Chamber,&quot; of the historic characters named in the ritual as &quot;Jacques DeMolay and his three preceptors, Geoffroi de Charney, Godfrey de Goneville, and Hughes de Peralde.&quot; The DeMolay Degree, in which players dress in robes and other period costume, and appear on a dimly-lit stage whereupon they dramatically deliver memorized lines prescribed in the ritual, is described therein as depicting &quot;the tragic climax in the career of Jacques DeMolay, the hero and martyr who is the exemplar of our Order.&quot; The stage instructions include that &quot;[t]he foremost point to be remembered is to portray Jacques DeMolay as the hero and to select an interpretation for the DeMolay Degree which will enhance the lessons of fidelity and toleration.&quot; The drama concludes with the commission condemning the four to life imprisonment; however, according to the ritual, &quot;so incensed was the king at the noble defiance and defense of DeMolay and Geoffroi de Charney that he overrode the Commission’s verdict and hurried DeMolay and de Charney to the stake on an island near the Cathedral, where they were barbarously burned.&quot;

<text>Dartmouth University is a defunct institution in New Hampshire which existed from 1817 to 1819. It was the result of a thwarted attempt by the state legislature to make Dartmouth College, a private college, into a public university. The United States Supreme Court case that settled the matter, &quot;Dartmouth College v. Woodward&quot;, is considered a landmark. 

==History (1817–1819)==
Dartmouth University operated in Hanover, New Hampshire, on the campus of Dartmouth College. The university was established by the New Hampshire Legislature in an act of June 27, 1816. The college trustees had dismissed President John Wheelock, and his allies in Concord sought to reinstate him through legislation. The act ostensibly modified the existing charter rather than establishing a new institution: it attempted to change the name to Dartmouth University, to increase the number of trustees from twelve to twenty-one, and to create a board of twenty-five overseers, including, &quot;ex officio&quot;, the governor and council, the president of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, and the governor and lieutenant-governor of Vermont.

The legislature had some reason to see the existing school as a state charity. Dartmouth used the terms &quot;college&quot; and &quot;university&quot; almost interchangeably in its early years. It accepted state grants of land and money, including the Second College Grant and state funding for the construction of its medical school in 1811. It included in its first board of trustees the governor, the president of Governor&#x27;s Council, two council members, the Speaker of the New Hampshire House, and an assistant of the Colony of Connecticut. 

Many of Dartmouth&#x27;s existing trustees refused to obey the legislature&#x27;s act, however, and the trustees of Dartmouth University failed to obtain a quorum to conduct any business. In response, the legislature voted on December 18, 1816, that the governor had the power to fill the vacancies left by the Trustees who would not submit (eight known as &quot;the Octagon&quot;) and decided to reduce the number required for a quorum. The university trustees met and brought the university into being during 1817. John Wheelock was named president, but upon his death in 1817 was replaced by his son-in-law, William Allen.

Dartmouth University as the legislature saw it would offer a broad professional program, including separate schools of law and medicine. The existing medical school continued to operate, but the rest of the university remained small: professors taught classes to a small number of undergraduates in Dartmouth Hall. The university took possession of the college charter and its seal, hiding them in a nearby farmhouse. A small group of university professors and allied townspeople attempted to take the private libraries of the college&#x27;s two literary societies, the Social Friends and the United Fraternity, which were located in Dartmouth Hall. Students living in the building heard the sound of an axe breaking down the door of the U.F. library at night and sounded the alarm. A group of students wielding sticks of firewood soon forced the professors out, and the societies removed their libraries to keep them from falling into the hands of the university.

The college, meanwhile, rented rooms in a building north of Dartmouth Hall and filed a suit in the county court to regain its property. Though lacking its former buildings, the college retained most of its students and had a much larger enrollment than the university. Students of the two institutions would pass each other on the Green between classes, and the two schools competed to reserve the college church for commencements on the same day. Both schools graduated students in 1817 and 1818.

Though the college effectively was fighting for its life against the legislature, its cause of action ostensibly sought the return of the charter and the seal from the university treasurer, William H. Woodward. The school lost and appealed the case directly to the state&#x27;s supreme court, where it lost again and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Daniel Webster argued the side of the college in the Dartmouth College Case, describing the charter this way: &quot;A charter of more liberal sentiments, of wiser provisions, drawn with more care, or in a better spirit, could not be expected at any time or from any other source.&quot;

The court decided the case near the end of 1818 and released Chief Justice John Marshall&#x27;s opinion in February 1819. The decision declared the legislature&#x27;s acts unconstitutional as interferences with the obligations of a contract, whether that contract was seen as the one that existed between college founder Eleazar Wheelock and the Crown, the one between the school&#x27;s various benefactors and the Crown, or between some other combination of parties. When the news reached Hanover several days later, the college and university were between terms, with few students in town. Many townspeople who supported the college celebrated, however, cheering loudly in the streets and firing a cannon. That spring, Dartmouth College reoccupied its buildings. 

The New Hampshire Legislature would not attempt to establish another university until the 1860s, when it created the land-grant forerunner of the University of New Hampshire, originally called the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts – in Hanover, associated with Dartmouth College.

<doc id="189650" wikidata="Q1411035" url="?curid=189650" title="Screaming Trees">
<text>Screaming Trees were an American rock band formed in Ellensburg, Washington, in 1984 by vocalist Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bassist Van Conner, and drummer Mark Pickerel. Pickerel was replaced by Barrett Martin in 1991. Screaming Trees became known as one of the pioneers of grunge along with Melvins, Mudhoney, U-Men, Skin Yard, Soundgarden, Green River, and Malfunkshun, among others. Although widely associated with grunge, the band&#x27;s sound incorporated hard rock and psychedelic elements.

After releasing a string of EPs and albums in the 1980s on independent labels, Screaming Trees signed with Epic Records in 1990. They released their major label debut album in 1991, &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot;, which spawned their first charting single &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;. After Martin replaced Pickerel on drums, Screaming Trees released their most successful album in 1992, &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot;. &quot;Dollar Bill&quot; became a minor radio hit, but the lead single &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; vastly increased the band&#x27;s popularity as it peaked at No. 5 on the Modern Rock Tracks Chart, No. 12 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart, No. 50 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 96 on the ARIA Chart.

After an extended hiatus and various recording sessions, the band&#x27;s follow-up album was eventually released in 1996, entitled &quot;Dust&quot;. Although the lead single &quot;All I Know&quot; peaked at No. 9 on both the Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, the album did not match its predecessor&#x27;s success. After difficulties in recording another album, the band announced their official breakup in 2000. Their aborted album from the late 1990s was later released in 2011 as &quot;Last Words: The Final Recordings&quot;. Lanegan died aged 57 on February 22, 2022. Van Conner died aged 55 on January 17, 2023.

== History ==
=== 1984–1989: Formation and early releases ===
The Conner brothers formed Screaming Trees with Mark Lanegan and Mark Pickerel in 1984 in Ellensburg, Washington, a small town a little over 100 miles from Seattle. The band was drawn together in high school by an interest in punk, garage, and classic rock.

The band rehearsed at the Conner family&#x27;s video rental store and recorded their demo tape &quot;Other Worlds&quot; in the summer of 1985 with Steve Fisk at Creative Fire recording studio in Ellensburg. It was initially distributed by the independent label K Records. &quot;Other Worlds&quot; then got a wider release through the independent label, Velvetone Records (also based out of Ellensburg). In 1986, they released their debut full-length album, &quot;Clairvoyance&quot;, also on the Velvetone label. Musically, the album combined psychedelic rock and hard rock with the band&#x27;s aforementioned influences. With Fisk&#x27;s help, the LP caught the attention of Greg Ginn, and the band were signed to SST Records.

In 1987, the band released their second LP, and their first for SST, &quot;Even If and Especially When&quot;. After the release of the album in 1987, the band began working the American indie circuit, playing shows across the US with other SST bands such as Firehose and Meat Puppets. In early 1988, Screaming Trees collaborated with the indie pop band Beat Happening on the EP &quot;Beat Happening/Screaming Trees&quot;. Screaming Trees&#x27; next album, &quot;Invisible Lantern&quot;, was released later on in 1988. SST also decided to re-release &quot;Other Worlds&quot; that same year. Screaming Trees then released the album &quot;Buzz Factory&quot; in 1989. While attempting to tour behind &quot;Buzz Factory&quot;, SST had difficulties in releasing the album. By the tour&#x27;s conclusion, the band became frustrated and departed from the label.

Towards the end of 1989, Screaming Trees briefly became a part of the roster for the prominent independent label Sub Pop. The label released the band&#x27;s EP &quot;Change Has Come&quot; in December 1989. Half of it was produced by Fisk and the other half was produced by Jack Endino. Drummer Pickerel later described the EP, in his own opinion, as &quot;our best recorded moment&quot;.

=== 1990–2000: Major label years ===
In 1990 the band signed a major label contract with Epic Records. The band released their fifth full-length album the following year, and first for a major label, &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot;. The album was produced by Terry Date and Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell and included the single &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;, which gained considerable airtime on alternative rock radio stations and peaked at No. 23 on the Modern Rock Tracks Chart. The single was the first Screaming Trees release to chart. Although &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot; sold better than their previous efforts, the band remained a cult act.

After the release of &quot;Uncle Anesthesia&quot; Van Conner went on hiatus from the band, choosing to tour as bass player for Dinosaur Jr. instead, with Donna Dresch filling in for him during Screaming Trees performances. Late in 1991, Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; became an unexpected commercial success, opening the gates for the rest of the Seattle scene.

Barrett Martin replaced previous drummer Pickerel and the new lineup recorded &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; in 1992. &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; was the band&#x27;s breakout album and included the hit single &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot;. The video for &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; became an MTV and alternative radio hit in the fall of 1992, thanks to its inclusion in the soundtrack for the film &quot;Singles&quot;. &quot;Nearly Lost You&quot; peaked at No. 5 on the Modern Rock Tracks Chart, No. 12 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart, No. 96 on the ARIA Chart, and No. 50 on the UK Singles Chart, making it the band&#x27;s first single to chart outside the United States. &quot;Dollar Bill&quot; was also released as a single and it peaked at No. 28 on the Modern Rock Tracks Chart and at No. 40 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart. Overall, &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; sold a total of 300,000 copies in the United States.

Screaming Trees were chosen by Nirvana band leader Kurt Cobain to appear on the final day of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom on August 30, 1992, which Nirvana headlined. Screaming Trees also played at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark in 1992 which Nirvana headlined as well. The band supported &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot; with a year-long tour, during which tension developed among the members. After the tour was finished, the group took an extended hiatus. During that time, Lanegan recorded his second solo album, &quot;Whiskey for the Holy Ghost&quot;, which was released in 1994. The following year, Lanegan was featured as a guest vocalist in the Barrett Martin (alongside Layne Staley and Mike McCready) side project Mad Season. Lanegan co-wrote and sang on two songs. Mad Season would only release one studio album because of Staley&#x27;s deteriorating health and the 1999 death of bassist John Baker Saunders. Mad Season attempted to reform with Lanegan on lead vocals, changing the band&#x27;s name to &quot;Disinformation&quot;, however the project never got off the ground. In 2013 Mad Season released a delxue version of their debut album, including three songs from the Disinformation sessions with new lyrics and vocals by Lanegan.

In early 1995, Screaming Trees toured Australia for the only time as part of the Big Day Out festival, before beginning work on their follow-up to &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot;. Following one stillborn attempt at the album, the band hired producer George Drakoulias, who had previously worked with the Black Crowes and the Jayhawks. The resulting album, &quot;Dust&quot;, was released in 1996, nearly four years after its predecessor. The album peaked at No. 134 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Chart, No. 32 on the UK Albums Chart, and No. 39 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top 100 Albums Chart. &quot;Dust&quot; gained favorable reviews while the singles &quot;Sworn and Broken&quot; peaked at No. 76 on the UK Singles Chart and &quot;All I Know&quot; peaked at No. 9 on both the Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts; however, the album ultimately did not match the sales of &quot;Sweet Oblivion&quot;. After the release of the album, Josh Homme, formerly from Kyuss, was hired as rhythm guitarist.

Following the &quot;Dust&quot; tour in the United States, Screaming Trees took another hiatus for Lanegan to begin his work on his third solo album, &quot;Scraps At Midnight&quot;, which was released in 1998. The band headed back into the studio in 1999 and recorded several demos including the song &quot;Ash Grey Sunday&quot; and shopped them around to labels, but no label was interested. The band played a few surprise shows in early 2000 to try to gain a label&#x27;s attention but they were unsuccessful. They did however release the song &quot;One Way Conversation&quot; on the Musicblitz Records internet label. In 2000, after a concert to celebrate the opening of Seattle&#x27;s Experience Music Project, the band announced their official breakup.

=== Final album and deaths of Lanegan and Van Conner ===
On June 22, 2011, it was announced that an unreleased album that Screaming Trees recorded in 1998 and 1999 would finally see the light of day. Titled &quot;Last Words: The Final Recordings&quot;, the album was mixed by Jack Endino and Martin. It was released digitally on Martin&#x27;s self-owned label Sunyata Productions on August 2, 2011, with CD and vinyl versions released in the following months.

In 2021, when asked about his time with Screaming Trees, Lanegan replied, &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like looking back at grade school. I definitely have fond memories and it&#x27;s really how I learned to sing — through trial and error, with those guys.&quot; Lanegan died on February 22, 2022, at his home in Killarney, Ireland.

Gary Lee Conner revealed on January 18, 2023 that Van Conner had died aged 55. He had previously been in a coma due to stomach surgery, followed by contracting COVID-19. It was reported that pneumonia had ultimately led to his death.

On Black Friday 2023, &quot;Wrong Turn to Jahannam: Live From Egg Studio 1991&quot; was released. It consisted of an in-studio rehearsal session by the band which was unreleased up to that point. Dan Peters of Mudhoney played drums on the recording as it was during his brief time in the band as a touring member.

==== Related projects ====
Mark Lanegan released a solo album in May 2001 entitled &quot;Field Songs&quot;. Also in that year, he became a member of the alternative rock group Queens of the Stone Age with Homme. Lanegan recorded two albums as one of the group&#x27;s three vocalists before leaving the group in late 2005. His sixth solo album &quot;Bubblegum&quot; was released in 2004 and became his best-selling album and his first solo album to chart. He went on to work with Greg Dulli in the Gutter Twins and the Twilight Singers. Lanegan also received critical acclaim for his albums with Isobel Campbell, one of which, &quot;Ballad of the Broken Seas&quot;, was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize.

Gary Lee Conner started the bands the Purple Outside and Microdot Gnome as the vocalist. He has also done session work with other musicians. In 1999, he released the single &quot;Grasshopper&#x27;s Daydream/Behind the Smile&quot; on Sub Pop, which featured his former bandmates Homme and Pickerel along with his brother Van as producer. Gary Lee later released four solo albums between 2016 and 2021.

Initially, Van Conner turned his efforts to his side-project Gardener with Aaron Stauffer (formerly of Seaweed, and later VALIS). In 2001, he contributed to Lanegan&#x27;s album &quot;Field Songs&quot;. Van has produced and contributed to several other projects over the years, including Kitty Kitty, VALIS, Gardener, and Gary Lee&#x27;s Sub Pop single &quot;Grasshopper&#x27;s Daydream/Behind the Smile&quot;. Van&#x27;s band VALIS released several recordings between 2002 and 2012.

Barrett Martin became a touring member for several bands after the breakup of Screaming Trees, including Stone Temple Pilots and R.E.M., and has released two solo albums with limited success. He later contributed to Lanegan&#x27;s solo album &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot; and the album &quot;Rated R&quot; by Queens of the Stone Age. He later became the drummer for Tuatara and also the drummer/vocalist in The Minus 5. Martin contributed playing drums on two albums by Nando Reis, a Brazilian musician: &quot;Para Quando O Arco Irís Encontrar O Pote de Ouro&quot; (2000) together with Peter Buck from R.E.M., and &quot;A Letra A&quot; (2003). In 2019, Martin formed the supergroup Silverlites (featuring Peter Buck, Rich Robinson, and Joseph Arthur) and released their self-titled debut in 2024.

Almost immediately after departing from Screaming Trees in 1991, Mark Pickerel formed the band Truly alongside Robert Roth, original Soundgarden bassist Hiro Yamamoto, and Chris Quinn. Truly released their debut EP &quot;Heart and Lungs&quot; in 1991, followed by Quinn&#x27;s departure shortly after. The band stayed as a trio and they released two full-length albums plus a compilation, followed by a hiatus in 1998. Pickerel also played drums on three of Lanegan&#x27;s solo albums throughout the 1990s. Pickerel released his debut solo album in 2006, &quot;Snake in the Radio&quot;. He eventually followed it up with three additional solo albums.

<doc id="189652" wikidata="Q7761643" url="?curid=189652" title="The Rowan">
<text>The Rowan (1990) is a science fiction novel by American writer Anne McCaffrey, the first book in &quot;The Tower and the Hive&quot; series (also known as &quot;The Rowan&quot; series). It is set in the universe of the &quot;Pegasus&quot; trilogy, against a backdrop of a technologically advanced society in which telepathy, psychokinesis and other psychic talents have become scientifically accepted and researched. Telekinetic and telepathic powers are used to communicate and teleport spaceships through space, thus avoiding the light barrier and allowing for the colonization of other planetary systems.

In the series, psionic powers occur of varying strength, the possessors being ranked from T12 (the weakest) to T1 (the strongest). The very strongest are employed as &quot;T1 Primes&quot; by an independent company, FT&amp;T (Federated Telepaths and Teleporters) for teleporting cargo and passengers between the systems.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Rowan&quot; tells the life story of a young orphan, of Prime Talent, from the moment the child&#x27;s community is wiped out in a mudslide to the time when she becomes a Prime and after a life of loneliness falls in love with a previously undiscovered Prime on Deneb which was being attacked by aliens.

The central section of the book is based on McCaffrey&#x27;s earlier short story &quot;Lady in the Tower&quot;.

===Characters===
====The Rowan/Angharad Gwyn====
* Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Callisto Prime
* Physical description: with silver-white hair and grey eyes (though stated to be brown on page 17 of the Ace/Putnam 1990 hardcover edition), she has a petite, &quot;bird like&quot; figure.
** The Rowan is the only survivor of a freak mudslide that destroyed the Rowan Mining Camp on Altair. Trapped in a hopper (ground vehicle) and buried in sludge for days, the 3 year-old toddler&#x27;s mental cries for help reach every telepath on the planet. Rescued, she is made a &quot;Ward of the Planet&quot; but, with no memory of her life before the mudslide, becomes known as &quot;the Rowan child&quot;. She grows up under the care of Lusena, a child therapist who becomes her foster mother.

::Well aware of her Prime potential, her guardians move her to Altair&#x27;s Tower at the age of twelve, to be instructed in the use of her Talent by Altair&#x27;s Prime, Siglen. After a difficult learning curve and lonely adolescence she ultimately reaches Prime status and is installed on Jupiter&#x27;s moon, Callisto.

====Siglen====
* Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Altair Prime
* Physical description: Siglen was a slab of a female, soft from a sedentary life and a disinclination to exercise of any kind.
** Siglen proved to be more harm than good when it came to dealing with the Rowan. She wasn&#x27;t empathic towards the child and instilled a neurosis (a form of agoraphobia that prevents interstellar teleports) in the three Primes that she trained. She has no empathy and is very trying for her staff and personnel to deal with. She is described as a &quot;mistress of the putdown&quot; and a generally unlikeable person.

====Lusena====
* Talent level: T-8 telepath; junior therapist
** Lusena took the young Rowan in as her own. She already had two older children, Bardy and Finnan. Lusena died in a crash when the Rowan was eighteen.

====Goswina Lyon====
* Talent level: T-5 empath
** Goswina first met the Rowan when she, along with seven other young Talents, traveled to Altair for a course on Tower management and maintenance. She soon realized that she and the Rowan could not work efficiently together and so recommended her brother Afra, who at the time was six. The Rowan then promised to make sure Afra came to Altair for the course when he was old enough.

====Afra Lyon====
* Talent level: T-4 (later T-3 then T-2) telekinetic/telepath
* Physical description: blonde hair, slightly green skin, yellow eyes, tall/slender figure.
** The Lyon family is from Capella, a &quot;Methody&quot; planet known for its adherence to rules and manners (and its colonists&#x27; unusual pigmentation). Afra, however, was slightly different; life on Capella didn&#x27;t appeal to him. At eighteen, Afra spent all his money to send a resume to the Rowan, the new Callisto Prime. The Prime sent for him the very next day. Afra was to the Rowan&#x27;s liking and became second in command of the Tower.

====Jeff Raven====
* Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath
* Physical description: black hair and piercing blue eyes.
** Jeff Raven was born on Deneb where a large population of &quot;Wild Talents&quot; resides. He first contacted the Rowan telepathically when he &quot;heard&quot; her getting ready to start her transportation work on Callisto. Jeff informed her that Deneb was under attack by hostile alien forces. The Rowan informed Earth Prime who refused to believe the words of an &quot;unknown Talent&quot;; Jeff quickly verified the attack was legitimate by telekinetically hurtling a missile towards Earth (which was quite an extraordinary feat considering how remote Deneb was and that the generator he tapped into for power was on the verge of collapse)

====Isthia Raven====
* Talent level: never tested, but she has a &quot;long ear&quot; and &quot;loud voice&quot;.
** Isthia is the mother of Jeff Raven. She gathered a team of other untrained Talents to help her contact the Rowan telepathically when Jeff was badly injured in an accident after the attacks.

====Peter Reidinger IV====
* Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Earth Prime
* Physical description: Black hair, close trimmed red beard and moustache. He is the descendant of the same Peter Reidinger who is featured in &quot;Pegasus in Flight&quot; and &quot;Pegasus in Space&quot;.
* The Reidinger family is full of extremely high Talents, and Peter Reidinger IV is surely one of the most powerful. He runs FT&amp;T.

====Elizara Matheson====
* Talent level: T-1 Medic/Ob. Deft, compassionate, sensible and reassuring, Elizara is Prime Reidinger&#x27;s great-granddaughter. She became a close friend and confidant of the Gwyn-Raven families, and later the Lyons, when she was assigned by Reidinger to assist the Rowan during her first pregnancy. Elizara is extremely skilled in metamorphic healing as well as physical. She is later re-introduced into the series as the very talented teacher of her gifted namesake, Zara Raven-Lyon, one of Damia&#x27;s many children.

====Brian Ackerman====
Talent Level: T-9; Callisto Stationmaster

====Primes====
Primes of FT&amp;T are T-1 telekinetic/telepaths. They are the rarest manifestation of Talent:
* Earth Prime: Peter Reidinger IV
* Altair Prime: Siglen
* Capella Prime: Capella
* Betelguese Prime: David
* Callisto Prime: The Rowan
* Procyon Prime: Guzman

<text>Sir Patrick Alfred Caldwell-Moore (; 4 March 1923 – 9 December 2012) was an English amateur astronomer who attained prominence in that field as a writer, researcher, radio commentator and television presenter.

Moore&#x27;s early interest in astronomy led him to join the British Astronomical Association at the age of 11. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War II and briefly taught before publishing his first book on lunar observation in 1953. Renowned for his expertise in Moon observation and the creation of the Caldwell catalogue, Moore authored more than seventy astronomy books. He hosted the world&#x27;s longest-running television series with the original presenter, BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;, from 1957 until his death in 2012. Idiosyncrasies such as his rapid diction and monocle made him a popular and instantly recognisable figure on British television. Moore was co-founder and president of the Society for Popular Astronomy.

Outside his field of astronomy, Moore appeared in the video game television show &quot;GamesMaster&quot;. Moore was also a self-taught xylophonist and pianist, as well as an accomplished composer. He was an amateur cricketer, golfer and chess player. In addition to many popular science books, he wrote numerous works of fiction. He was an opponent of fox hunting, an outspoken critic of the European Union and a supporter of the UK Independence Party, and he served as chairman of the short-lived anti-immigration United Country Party. He was knighted in 2001.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Pinner, Middlesex, on 4 March 1923 to Capt. Charles Trachsel Caldwell-Moore MC (died 1947) and Gertrude (née White) (died 1981). His family moved to Bognor Regis, and subsequently to East Grinstead where he spent his childhood. His youth was marked by heart problems, which left him in poor health, and he was educated at home by private tutors. He developed an interest in astronomy at the age of six and joined the British Astronomical Association at the age of 11. He was invited to run a small observatory in East Grinstead at the age of 14, after his mentor, William Sadler Franks – who ran the observatory – was killed in a road accident. At the age of 16, he began wearing a monocle after an oculist told him his right eye was weaker than his left.

During World War II, Moore joined the Home Guard in East Grinstead, where his father had been elected platoon commander. Records show that he enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in December 1941 at age 18 and was not called up for service until July 1942 as an Aircraftman, 2nd Class. After basic training at various RAF bases in England, he went to Canada under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. He completed training at RAF Moncton in New Brunswick as a navigator and pilot. Returning to England in June 1944, he was commissioned as a pilot officer and was posted to RAF Millom in Cumberland, where he claimed to have been a navigator in the crew of a Vickers Wellington bomber, engaged in maritime patrolling and bombing missions to mainland Europe, though in fact he was still in training at Millom. He was only posted to Bomber Command five days before the end of the war in Europe. After the end of hostilities, Moore became an adjutant and then an Area Meteorological Officer, demobilising in October 1945 with the rank of flying officer.

==Career in astronomy==
After the war, Moore rejected a grant to study at the University of Cambridge, citing a wish to &quot;stand on my own two feet&quot;. He wrote his first book, &quot;Guide to the Moon&quot; (later retitled &quot;Patrick Moore on the Moon&quot;) in 1952, and it was published a year later. He was a teacher in Woking and at Holmewood House School in Langton Green in Kent from 1945 to 1953. His second book was a translation of a work of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs (Moore spoke fluent French). After his second original science book, &quot;Guide to the Planets&quot;, he wrote his first work of fiction, &quot;The Master of the Moon&quot;, the first of numerous young adult fiction space adventure books (including the late 1970s series the &quot;Scott Saunders Space Adventure&quot;); he wrote a more adult novel and a farce titled &quot;Ancient Lights&quot;, though he did not wish either to be published. Moore also translated the book &quot;Quanta&quot; by J Lochak and Andrade E Silva, published in 1969, from the French.

While teaching at Holmewood, he set up a 12½ inch reflector telescope at his home, which he kept into his old age. He developed a particular interest in the far side of the Moon, a small part of which is visible from Earth as a result of the Moon&#x27;s libration; the Moon was his specialist subject throughout his life. Moore described the short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface and gave them the name transient lunar phenomena in 1968.

His first television appearance was in a debate about the existence of flying saucers following a spate of reported sightings in the 1950s; Moore argued against Lord Dowding and other UFO proponents. He was invited to present a live astronomy programme and said the greatest difficulty was finding an appropriate theme tune; the opening of Jean Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; was chosen and used throughout the programme&#x27;s existence. The programme was originally named &quot;Star Map&quot; before &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; was chosen in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;. On 24 April 1957, at 10:30 pm, Moore presented the first episode about the Comet Arend–Roland. The programme was pitched to casual viewers up to professional astronomers, in a format which remained consistent from its inception. Moore presented every monthly episode except for one in July 2004 when he suffered a near-fatal bout of food poisoning caused by eating a contaminated goose egg and was replaced for that episode by Chris Lintott. Moore appears in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; book as the world&#x27;s longest-serving TV presenter having presented the programme since 1957. From 2004 to 2012, the programme was broadcast from Moore&#x27;s home when arthritis prevented him from travelling to the studios. Over the years, he received many lucrative offers to take his programme onto other networks but rejected them because he held a &#x27;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&#x27; with the BBC.

In 1959, the Russians allowed Moore to be the first Westerner to see the photographic results of the Luna 3 probe and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time, Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live, and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;, in September 1961, Moore&#x27;s attempt to be the first to broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended &#x27;comedy episode&#x27;, as cloud obscured the sky.

In 1965, he was appointed director of the newly constructed Armagh Planetarium in Northern Ireland, a post he held until 1968. His stay outside England was short partly because of the beginning of The Troubles, a dispute Moore wanted no involvement in. He was appointed Armagh County secretary of the Scout movement but resigned after being informed that Catholics could not be admitted. In developing the Planetarium, Moore travelled to Japan to secure a Goto Mars projector. He helped with the redevelopment of the Birr Telescope in the Republic of Ireland. He was a key figure in the development of the Herschel Museum of Astronomy in Bath.

In June 1968, he returned to England, settling in Selsey after resigning from his post in Armagh. During the NASA Apollo programme, presenting on the Apollo 8 mission, he declared that &quot;this is one of the great moments of human history&quot;, only to have his broadcast interrupted by the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Jackanory&quot;. He was a presenter for the Apollo 9 and Apollo 10 missions, and a commenter, with Cliff Michelmore and James Burke, for BBC television&#x27;s coverage of the Moon landing missions. Moore could not remember his words at the &quot;Eagle has landed&quot; moment, and the BBC lost the tapes of the broadcast. A homemade recording reveals that the studio team was very quiet during the landing sequence, leaving the NASA commentary clear of interruptions. Some 14 seconds after &quot;contact&quot; Burke says &quot;They&#x27;ve touched&quot;. At 36 seconds, he says, &quot;Eagle has landed&quot;. Between 53 and 62 seconds, he explains the upcoming stay/no-stay decision, and NASA announces the T1 stay at 90 seconds after contact. At 100 seconds, the recorded sequence ends. Thus, any real-time comment Moore made was not broadcast live, and the recording ends before Burke polls the studio team for comment and reaction. Moore participated in TV coverage of Apollo missions 12 to 17.
He was elected a member of the International Astronomical Union in 1966; having twice edited the Union&#x27;s General Assembly newsletters. He attempted to establish an International Union of Amateur Astronomers, which failed due to lack of interest. During the 1970s and 80s, he reported on the Voyager and Pioneer programs, often from NASA headquarters. At this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked him questions such as &quot;Why waste money on space research when there is so much to be done here?&quot;. He said that when asked these type of questions &quot;I know that I&#x27;m dealing with an idiot.&quot; Another question that annoyed him was &quot;what is the difference between astronomy and astrology?&quot; Despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house, and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions, as well as those from conspiracy theorists, proponents of hunting and &#x27;cranks&#x27;. Despite his fame, his telephone number was always listed in the telephone directory and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory.

He compiled the Caldwell catalogue, of 109 star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies for observation by amateur astronomers. In 1982, asteroid 2602 Moore was named in his honour. In February 1986, he presented a special episode of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; on the approach of Halley&#x27;s Comet. However, he later said the BBC&#x27;s better-funded &quot;Horizon&quot; team &quot;made a complete hash of the programme.&quot; In January 1998, a tornado destroyed part of Moore&#x27;s garden observatory; it was subsequently rebuilt. Moore campaigned unsuccessfully against the closure of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in 1998. Among Moore&#x27;s favourite episodes of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; were those that dealt with eclipses, and he said, &quot;there is nothing in nature to match the glory of a total eclipse of the Sun.&quot;

Moore was a BBC presenter for the total eclipse in England in 1999, though the view he and his team had from Cornwall was obscured by cloud. Moore was the patron of the South Downs Planetarium and Science Centre, and he attended its official opening in 2001.

On 1 April 2007, a 50th anniversary semi-spoof edition of the programme was broadcast on BBC One, with Moore depicted as a Time Lord. It featured special guests, amateur astronomers Jon Culshaw (impersonating Moore presenting the first &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;) and Brian May. On 6 May 2007, a special edition of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; was broadcast on BBC One to commemorate the programme&#x27;s 50th anniversary, with a party in Moore&#x27;s garden at Selsey, attended by amateur and professional astronomers. Moore celebrated the record-breaking 700th episode of &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; at his home in Sussex on 6 March 2011. He presented with the help of special guests Professor Brian Cox, Jon Culshaw and Lord Rees, the Astronomer Royal.

It was reported in January 2012 that because of arthritis and the effects of an old spinal injury, he was no longer able to operate a telescope. However, he was still able to present &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; from his home.

==Activism and political beliefs==
Moore briefly supported the Liberal Party in the 1950s, though later condemned the Liberal Democrats, saying he believed they could alter their position radically and that they &quot;would happily join up with the BNP or the Socialist Workers Party ... if [by doing so] they could win a few extra votes.&quot; In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as the two men agreed the French and Germans were not to be trusted. Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. He also admired the Official Monster Raving Loony Party and was briefly their financial adviser. A Eurosceptic, he was a supporter and patron of the UK Independence Party, and campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny, the UKIP candidate for the Chichester constituency in 2001.

Moore was known for his conservative political views. Proudly declaring himself to be English (rather than British) with &quot;not the slightest wish to integrate with anybody&quot;, he stated his admiration for British politician Enoch Powell. Moore devoted an entire chapter (&quot;The Weak Arm of the Law&quot;) of his autobiography to denouncing modern British society, particularly &quot;motorist-hunting&quot; policemen, sentencing policy, the Race Relations Act, Sex Discrimination Act and the &quot;Thought Police/Politically Correct Brigade&quot;. He wrote that &quot;homosexuals are mainly responsible for the spreading of AIDS (the Garden of Eden is home of Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve)&quot;. In 2007, in an interview with &quot;Radio Times&quot;, he said the BBC was being &quot;ruined by women&quot;, commenting that: &quot;The trouble is that the BBC now is run by women and it shows: soap operas, cooking, quizzes, kitchen-sink plays. You wouldn&#x27;t have had that in the golden days.&quot; In response, a BBC spokeswoman described Moore as being one of TV&#x27;s best-loved figures and remarked that his &quot;forthright&quot; views were &quot;what we all love about him&quot;. During his June 2002 appearance on &quot;Room 101&quot; he banished female newsreaders into Room 101.
He wrote in his autobiography that Liechtenstein – a constitutional monarchy headed by a prince – had the best political system in the world. Moore was a critic of the Iraq War, and said &quot;the world was a safer place when Ronald Reagan was in the White House&quot;.

Moore cited his opposition to fox hunting, blood sport and capital punishment to rebut claims that he had ultra-right-wing views. Though not a vegetarian, he held &quot;a deep contempt for people who go out to kill merely to amuse themselves.&quot; He was an animal lover, supporting many animal welfare charities (particularly Cats Protection). He had a particular affinity for cats and stated that &quot;a catless house is a soulless house&quot;.

Moore was opposed to astronomy being taught in schools. In an interview, he said:
==Other interests and popular culture==
Because of his long-running television career and eccentric demeanour, Moore was widely recognised and became a popular public figure. In 1976 it was used to good effect for an April Fools&#x27; Day spoof on BBC Radio 2, when Moore announced a once-in-a-lifetime astronomical event that meant that if listeners could jump at that exact moment, 9.47 a.m. they would experience a temporary sensation of weightlessness. The BBC received many telephone calls from listeners alleging they experienced the sensation. He was a key figure in the establishment of the &quot;International Birdman&quot; event in Bognor Regis, which was initially held in Selsey.

Moore appeared in other television and radio shows, including the BBC Radio 4 panel show &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. From 1992 until 1998, he played the role of GamesMaster, a character who knew everything about video games, in the Channel 4 television series &quot;GamesMaster&quot;. GamesMaster would issue video game challenges and answered questions about cheats and tips. The show&#x27;s host, Dominik Diamond, said that Moore did not understand anything he said on the show but recorded his contributions in single takes.

Moore was a keen amateur actor, appearing in local plays. He appeared in self-parodying roles, in several episodes of &quot;The Goodies&quot; and on the Morecambe and Wise show, and broadcast with Kenneth Horne only a few days before Horne&#x27;s death. He had a minor role in the fourth radio series of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, and a lead role in the BBC Radio 1 sci-fi play, &quot;Independence Day UK&quot; in which amongst other things, Moore fills in as a navigator. Among other shows, he appeared in &quot;It&#x27;s a Celebrity Knockout&quot;, &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; and &quot;Face the Music&quot;, and in the &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; episode &quot;Round Britain Whizz&quot;.

Moore expressed appreciation for the science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but stated that he had stopped watching when &quot;they went PC - making women commanders, that kind of thing&quot;. Despite this he made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; in 2010, which was Matt Smith&#x27;s debut as the Eleventh Doctor. In the 1960s, Moore had been approached by the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story editor Gerry Davis to act as a scientific advisor on the series to help with the accuracy of stories, a position ultimately taken by Kit Pedler.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burk/Smith&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A keen amateur chess player, Moore carried a pocket set and was vice president of Sussex Junior Chess Association. In 2003, he presented Sussex Junior David Howell with the best young chess player award on Carlton Television&#x27;s &quot;Britain&#x27;s Brilliant Prodigies&quot; show. Moore had represented Sussex in his youth.

Moore was an enthusiastic amateur cricketer, playing for the Selsey Cricket Club well into his seventies. He played for the Lord&#x27;s Taverners, a cricketing charity team, as a bowler with an unorthodox action. Though an accomplished leg spin bowler, he was a number 11 batsman and a poor fielder. The jacket notes to his book &quot;Suns, Myths and Men&quot; (1968) said his hobbies included &quot;chess, which he plays with a peculiar leg-spin, and cricket.&quot; He played golf and won a Pro-Am competition in Southampton in 1975.

Until forced to give up because of arthritis, Moore was a keen pianist and accomplished xylophone player, having first played the instrument at the age of 13. He composed a substantial corpus of works, including two operettas. Moore had a ballet, &quot;Lyra&#x27;s Dream&quot;, written to his music. He performed at a Royal Command Performance, and performed a duet with Evelyn Glennie.

In 1998, as a guest on &quot;Have I Got News for You,&quot; he accompanied the show&#x27;s closing theme tune on the xylophone and as a pianist, he once accompanied Albert Einstein playing &quot;The Swan&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns on the violin (no recording was made). In 1981 he performed a solo xylophone rendition of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; in a Royal Variety Performance. He did not enjoy most popular music: when played ten modern rock songs by such artists as Hawkwind, Muse and Pink Floyd, in a 2009 interview with journalist Joel McIver, he explained, &quot;To my ear, all these songs are universally awful.&quot;

Before encountering health problems, he was an extensive traveller and had visited all seven continents, including Antarctica; he said his favourite two countries were Iceland and Norway. On 7 March 2006 he was hospitalised and fitted with a pacemaker because of cardiac dysrhythmia.

Moore was a friend of the Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May, who was an occasional guest on &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;. May bought Moore&#x27;s Selsey home in 2008, leasing it back to him for a peppercorn rent the same day to provide financial security. May, Moore and Chris Lintott co-wrote a book &quot;Bang! The Complete History of the Universe&quot;. In February 2011, Moore completed (with Robin Rees and Iain Nicolson) his comprehensive &quot;Patrick Moore&#x27;s Data Book of Astronomy&quot; for Cambridge University Press. In 1986, he was identified as the co-author of a book published in 1954 called &quot;Flying Saucer from Mars&quot;, attributed to Cedric Allingham, which was intended as a money-making venture and practical joke on UFO believers; Moore never admitted his involvement.

Moore believed himself to be the only person to have met the first aviator, Orville Wright, the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, and the first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong.

In March 2015, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 45-minute play based on the life of Moore, &quot;The Far Side of the Moore&quot; by Sean Grundy, starring Tom Hollander as Moore and Patricia Hodge as his mother.

Moore is portrayed by Daniel Beales in the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;.

==Honours and appointments==

In 1945, Moore was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS), and in 1977 he was awarded the society&#x27;s Jackson-Gwilt Medal. He was also a long-time Fellow of the British Interplanetary Society and a member of its Council; he was the founding editor of the Society&#x27;s monthly magazine &quot;Spaceflight&quot;, first published in 1956. He made the Sir Patrick Moore Medal to recognise outstanding contributions to the Society. In 1968, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and promoted to a Commander (CBE) in 1988. In 1999, he became the Honorary President of the East Sussex Astronomical Society, a position he held until his death. Moore was knighted for &quot;services to the popularisation of science and to broadcasting&quot; in the 2001 New Year Honours.

In 2001, he was appointed an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society (HonFRS) since he had been the most effective and influential writer and speaker about astronomy in the UK and for his contribution to science in the United Kingdom. In June 2002, he was appointed as the Honorary Vice-president of the Society for the History of Astronomy. Also in 2002, Buzz Aldrin presented him with a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for services to television. He was patron of Torquay Boys&#x27; Grammar School in south Devon. Moore had a long association with the University of Leicester and its Department of Physics and Astronomy and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science (HonDSc) degree in 1996 and a Distinguished Honorary Fellowship in 2008, the highest award that the university can bestow.

==Personal life and death==
World War II had a significant influence on Moore&#x27;s life – he said his only romance ended when his fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in London in 1943 by a bomb which struck her ambulance. Moore subsequently remarked that he never married because &quot;there was no one else for me ... second best is no good for me ... I would have liked a wife and family, but it was not to be.&quot; In his biography of Moore, Martin Mobberley expressed doubts over this account, as it was not possible to identify Lorna, saying that Moore told varying stories about her. In his autobiography, he said that after sixty years, he still thought about her, and because of her death, &quot;if I saw the entire German nation sinking into the sea, I could be relied upon to help push it down.&quot; In May 2012, Moore told the &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine, &quot;We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance.&quot; He also said, in the same interview, that &quot;the only good Kraut is a dead Kraut&quot;.

Moore said he was &quot;exceptionally close&quot; to his mother Gertrude, a talented artist who shared his home at Selsey, West Sussex, which was decorated with her paintings of &quot;bogeys&quot; – little friendly aliens – that she produced and sent out annually as the Moores&#x27; Christmas cards. Moore wrote the foreword for his mother&#x27;s 1974 book, &quot;Mrs Moore in Space&quot;.

On 9 December 2012, Moore died of sepsis and heart failure, at his home in Selsey, aged 89. On 9 December 2014, it was reported that the Science Museum, London had acquired a large collection of his objects and manuscripts and memorabilia, including &quot;The Sky at Night&quot; scripts, and about 70 of his observation books, over more than 60 years, and manuscripts for astronomy and fiction books, and a 12.5-inch reflecting telescope.

==Bibliography==
Moore wrote many popular books. From 1962 to 2011, he also edited the long-running annual &quot;Yearbook of Astronomy&quot; and was editor for many other science books in that period. He also wrote science fiction novels for children and wrote humorous works under the pen-name R. T. Fishall. The list below is therefore not exhaustive.

<text>L&#x27;Anse-Saint-Jean (), French for &quot;The Cove of Saint John&quot; is a municipality in the Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec, Canada. Its population was 1,301 in the Canada 2021 Census.

L&#x27;Anse-Saint-Jean was founded in 1838 by the Société des Vingt-et-un, a group of lumber prospectors and investors from Charlevoix which was responsible for opening up the Saguenay region to colonization.

The village achieved some fame in 1997 when its citizens voted in a referendum to declare the village a &quot;municipal monarchy&quot; as the Kingdom of L&#x27;Anse Saint Jean.

==History==
===Kingdom of L&#x27;Anse-Saint-Jean===

The village&#x27;s citizens held a referendum on 21 January 1997, to turn the village into &quot;Le Royaume de L&#x27;Anse-Saint-Jean&quot; (the kingdom of L&#x27;Anse Saint Jean), the continent&#x27;s first &quot;municipal monarchy.&quot; The monarchists won 73.9% of the vote, with Denys Tremblay becoming King Denys I. The king was crowned on 24 June, Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, in the Église Saint-Jean-Baptiste, and announced plans to build a &quot;vegetable oratory,&quot; Saint-Jean-du-Millénaire (Saint John of the Millennium). 

This micronational project was cheerfully conceded to be a way of boosting tourism in the region, which had been hit by the 1996 Saguenay Flood.

Denis I abdicated on 14 January 2000, bringing the purported kingdom to an end.

<text>Johann Georg Graevius (originally &quot;Grava&quot; or &quot;Greffe&quot;; Latin: Joannes/Johannes Georgius Graevius; 29 January 1632 – 11 January 1703) was a German classical scholar and critic. He was born in Naumburg, in the Electorate of Saxony.

==Life==
Graevius was originally intended for the law, but made the acquaintance of Johann Friedrich Gronovius during a casual visit to Deventer, under whose influence he abandoned jurisprudence for philology. He completed his studies under Daniel Heinsius at Leiden, and among others under the Protestant theologian David Blondel at Amsterdam.

During his residence in Amsterdam, under Blondel&#x27;s influence he abandoned Lutheranism and joined the Reformed Church; and in 1656 he was called by the Elector of Brandenburg to the chair of rhetoric in the University of Duisburg. Two years afterwards, on the recommendation of Gronovius, he was chosen to succeed that scholar at Deventer; in 1662 he moved to the University of Utrecht, where he occupied first the chair of rhetoric, and in addition, from 1667 until his death, that of history and politics.
Graevius enjoyed a very high reputation as a teacher, and his lecture-room was crowded by pupils, many of them of distinguished rank, from all parts of the world. He was visited by Lorenzo Magalotti and honoured with special recognition by Louis XIV, and was a particular favourite of William III of England, who made him historiographer royal.

His library, rich in antiquarian classical books, was bought after his death by Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine (reigned 1690–1716); part of it was later transferred to Heidelberg University Library

Graevius died in Utrecht in 1703.

==Work==
His two most important works are the &quot;Thesaurus antiquitatum Romanarum&quot; (1694–1699, in 12 volumes), and the &quot;Thesaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italiae&quot; published after his death, and continued by the elder Pieter Burmann (1704–1725), although these have not always been looked upon favourably. His editions of the classics, although they marked a distinct advance in scholarship, are now for the most part superseded. They include &quot;Hesiod&quot; (1667), &quot;Lucian&quot;, &quot;Pseudosophista&quot; (1668), &quot;Justin&quot;, &quot;Historiae Philippicae&quot; (1669), &quot;Suetonius&quot; (1672), &quot;Catullus&quot;, &quot;Tibullus et Propertius&quot; (1680), and several of the works of Cicero.

He also edited many of the writings of contemporary scholars. He corresponded with scholars throughout Europe including with Albert Rubens, the son of Peter Paul Rubens who was a prominent classical scholar and numismatist. He posthumously edited a collection of Albert Rubens&#x27;s essays on ancient clothing, coins and gems, which was published in 1665 by Balthasar Moretus in Antwerp under the title &quot;De re vestiaria veterum, [...], et alia eiusdem opuscula posthuma&quot;.

<text>Richard Dawes (170821 March 1766) was an English classical scholar.

==Life==

He was born in or near Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England, and was educated at the town&#x27;s grammar school under Anthony Blackwall, and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which he was elected fellow in 1731. His eccentricities and frank speaking made him unpopular. His health broke down as a result of his sedentary life, and he took to bell-ringing at Great St Mary&#x27;s as exercise. He was a bitter enemy of Richard Bentley, who he declared knew nothing of Greek except from indexes.

In 1738, Dawes was appointed to the mastership of the Royal Free Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne, combined with that of St Mary&#x27;s Hospital. His mind seems to have become unhinged; his continual disputes with his governing body ruined the school, and in 1749, he resigned and retired to Heworth, where he spent most of his time boating.

==Works==

The book on which Dawes&#x27; fame rests is his &quot;Miscellanea critica&quot; (1745), which gained the commendation of L. C. Valckenaer and Johann Jakob Reiske. &quot;The Miscellanea&quot;, which was re-edited by Thomas Burgess (1781), Gottlieb Christoph Harless (1800) and Thomas Kidd (1817), for many years enjoyed a high reputation. Some of the &quot;canons&quot; proved untenable and few were accepted universally; but it remains a monument of English scholarship.

<text>In mathematics, a Hermitian matrix (or self-adjoint matrix) is a complex square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose—that is, the element in the -th row and -th column is equal to the complex conjugate of the element in the -th row and -th column, for all indices and :
formula_1

or in matrix form:
formula_2

Hermitian matrices can be understood as the complex extension of real symmetric matrices.

If the conjugate transpose of a matrix formula_3 is denoted by formula_4 then the Hermitian property can be written concisely as

formula_5

Hermitian matrices are named after Charles Hermite, who demonstrated in 1855 that matrices of this form share a property with real symmetric matrices of always having real eigenvalues. Other, equivalent notations in common use are formula_6 although in quantum mechanics, formula_7 typically means the complex conjugate only, and not the conjugate transpose.

==Alternative characterizations==

Hermitian matrices can be characterized in a number of equivalent ways, some of which are listed below:

===Equality with the adjoint===

A square matrix formula_3 is Hermitian if and only if it is equal to its conjugate transpose, that is, it satisfies
formula_9
for any pair of vectors formula_10 where formula_11 denotes the inner product operation.

This is also the way that the more general concept of self-adjoint operator is defined.

===Real-valuedness of quadratic forms===

An formula_12 matrix formula_3 is Hermitian if and only if
formula_14

===Spectral properties===

A square matrix formula_3 is Hermitian if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

==Applications==

Hermitian matrices are fundamental to quantum mechanics because they describe operators with necessarily real eigenvalues. An eigenvalue formula_16 of an operator formula_17 on some quantum state formula_18 is one of the possible measurement outcomes of the operator, which requires the operators to have real eigenvalues.

In signal processing, Hermitian matrices are utilized in tasks like Fourier analysis and signal representation. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Hermitian matrices play a crucial role in analyzing signals and extracting meaningful information.

Hermitian matrices are extensively studied in linear algebra and numerical analysis. They have well-defined spectral properties, and many numerical algorithms, such as the Lanczos algorithm, exploit these properties for efficient computations. Hermitian matrices also appear in techniques like singular value decomposition (SVD) and eigenvalue decomposition.

In statistics and machine learning, Hermitian matrices are used in covariance matrices, where they represent the relationships between different variables. The positive definiteness of a Hermitian covariance matrix ensures the well-definedness of multivariate distributions.

Hermitian matrices are applied in the design and analysis of communications system, especially in the field of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Channel matrices in MIMO systems often exhibit Hermitian properties.

In graph theory, Hermitian matrices are used to study the spectra of graphs. The Hermitian Laplacian matrix is a key tool in this context, as it is used to analyze the spectra of mixed graphs. The Hermitian-adjacency matrix of a mixed graph is another important concept, as it is a Hermitian matrix that plays a role in studying the energies of mixed graphs.

==Examples and solutions==

In this section, the conjugate transpose of matrix formula_19 is denoted as formula_20 the transpose of matrix formula_19 is denoted as formula_22 and conjugate of matrix formula_19 is denoted as formula_24

See the following example:

formula_25

The diagonal elements must be real, as they must be their own complex conjugate.

Well-known families of Hermitian matrices include the Pauli matrices, the Gell-Mann matrices and their generalizations. In theoretical physics such Hermitian matrices are often multiplied by imaginary coefficients, which results in skew-Hermitian matrices.

Here, we offer another useful Hermitian matrix using an abstract example. If a square matrix formula_19 equals the product of a matrix with its conjugate transpose, that is, formula_27 then formula_19 is a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix. Furthermore, if formula_29 is row full-rank, then formula_19 is positive definite.

==Properties==

===Main diagonal values are real===

The entries on the main diagonal (top left to bottom right) of any Hermitian matrix are real.

Only the main diagonal entries are necessarily real; Hermitian matrices can have arbitrary complex-valued entries in their off-diagonal elements, as long as diagonally-opposite entries are complex conjugates.

===Symmetric===

A matrix that has only real entries is symmetric if and only if it is a Hermitian matrix. A real and symmetric matrix is simply a special case of a Hermitian matrix.

So, if a real anti-symmetric matrix is multiplied by a real multiple of the imaginary unit formula_31 then it becomes Hermitian.

===Normal===

Every Hermitian matrix is a normal matrix. That is to say, formula_32

===Diagonalizable===

The finite-dimensional spectral theorem says that any Hermitian matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix, and that the resulting diagonal matrix has only real entries. This implies that all eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix with dimension are real, and that has linearly independent eigenvectors. Moreover, a Hermitian matrix has orthogonal eigenvectors for distinct eigenvalues. Even if there are degenerate eigenvalues, it is always possible to find an orthogonal basis of consisting of eigenvectors of .

===Sum of Hermitian matrices===

The sum of any two Hermitian matrices is Hermitian.

===Inverse is Hermitian===

The inverse of an invertible Hermitian matrix is Hermitian as well.

===Associative product of Hermitian matrices===

The product of two Hermitian matrices and is Hermitian if and only if .

 = \overline{B^\mathsf{T} A^\mathsf{T}} = \overline{B^\mathsf{T}} \ \overline{A^\mathsf{T}} = B^\mathsf{H} A^\mathsf{H} = BA.&lt;/math&gt; Thus formula_33 if and only if formula_34

Thus is Hermitian if is Hermitian and is an integer.

===&quot;ABA&quot; Hermitian===

If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are Hermitian, then &quot;ABA&quot; is also Hermitian.
=== is real for complex ===

For an arbitrary complex valued vector the product formula_35 is real because of formula_36 This is especially important in quantum physics where Hermitian matrices are operators that measure properties of a system, e.g. total spin, which have to be real.

===Complex Hermitian forms vector space over ===

The Hermitian complex -by- matrices do not form a vector space over the complex numbers, , since the identity matrix is Hermitian, but is not. However the complex Hermitian matrices &quot;do&quot; form a vector space over the real numbers . In the -dimensional vector space of complex matrices over , the complex Hermitian matrices form a subspace of dimension . If denotes the -by- matrix with a in the position and zeros elsewhere, a basis (orthonormal with respect to the Frobenius inner product) can be described as follows:
formula_37

together with the set of matrices of the form
formula_38

and the matrices
formula_39

where formula_40 denotes the imaginary unit, formula_41

An example is that the four Pauli matrices form a complete basis for the vector space of all complex 2-by-2 Hermitian matrices over .

===Eigendecomposition===

If orthonormal eigenvectors formula_42 of a Hermitian matrix are chosen and written as the columns of the matrix , then one eigendecomposition of is formula_43 where formula_44 and therefore 
formula_45
where formula_46 are the eigenvalues on the diagonal of the diagonal matrix formula_47

=== Singular values ===
The singular values of formula_3 are the absolute values of its eigenvalues:

Since formula_3 has an eigendecomposition formula_50, where formula_51 is a unitary matrix (its columns are orthonormal vectors; see above), a singular value decomposition of formula_3 is formula_53, where formula_54 and formula_55 are diagonal matrices containing the absolute values formula_56 and signs formula_57 of formula_3&#x27;s eigenvalues, respectively. formula_59 is unitary, since the columns of formula_60 are only getting multiplied by formula_61. formula_54 contains the singular values of formula_3, namely, the absolute values of its eigenvalues.

===Real determinant===

The determinant of a Hermitian matrix is real:
(Alternatively, the determinant is the product of the matrix&#x27;s eigenvalues, and as mentioned before, the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real.)

==Decomposition into Hermitian and skew-Hermitian matrices==

Additional facts related to Hermitian matrices include:
* The sum of a square matrix and its conjugate transpose formula_64 is Hermitian.
* The difference of a square matrix and its conjugate transpose formula_65 is skew-Hermitian (also called antihermitian). This implies that the commutator of two Hermitian matrices is skew-Hermitian.
* An arbitrary square matrix can be written as the sum of a Hermitian matrix and a skew-Hermitian matrix . This is known as the Toeplitz decomposition of . formula_66

==Rayleigh quotient==
In mathematics, for a given complex Hermitian matrix and nonzero vector , the Rayleigh quotient formula_67 is defined as:
formula_68

For real matrices and vectors, the condition of being Hermitian reduces to that of being symmetric, and the conjugate transpose formula_69 to the usual transpose formula_70 formula_71 for any non-zero real scalar formula_72 Also, recall that a Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrix has real eigenvalues.

It can be shown that, for a given matrix, the Rayleigh quotient reaches its minimum value formula_73 (the smallest eigenvalue of M) when formula_74 is formula_75 (the corresponding eigenvector). Similarly, formula_76 and formula_77

The Rayleigh quotient is used in the min-max theorem to get exact values of all eigenvalues. It is also used in eigenvalue algorithms to obtain an eigenvalue approximation from an eigenvector approximation. Specifically, this is the basis for Rayleigh quotient iteration.

The range of the Rayleigh quotient (for matrix that is not necessarily Hermitian) is called a numerical range (or spectrum in functional analysis). When the matrix is Hermitian, the numerical range is equal to the spectral norm. Still in functional analysis, formula_78 is known as the spectral radius. In the context of C*-algebras or algebraic quantum mechanics, the function that to associates the Rayleigh quotient for a fixed and varying through the algebra would be referred to as &quot;vector state&quot; of the algebra.

<doc id="189683" wikidata="Q785096" url="?curid=189683" title="HMNZS Achilles">
<text>HMNZS &quot;Achilles&quot; was a light cruiser, the second of five in the class. She served in the Royal New Zealand Navy in the Second World War. She was launched in 1931 for the Royal Navy, loaned to New Zealand in 1936 and transferred to the new Royal New Zealand Navy in 1941. She became famous for her part in the Battle of the River Plate, alongside and and notable for being the first Royal Navy cruiser to have fire control radar, with the installation of the New Zealand-made SS1 fire-control radar in June 1940.

After Second World War service in the Atlantic and Pacific, she was returned to the Royal Navy. She was sold to the Indian Navy in 1948 and recommissioned as INS &quot;Delhi&quot;. She was scrapped in 1978.

==Design==
She was the second of five ships of the &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruisers, designed as effective follow-ons to the . Upgraded to &quot;Improved Leander&quot;-class, she could carry an aircraft and was the first ship to carry a Supermarine Walrus, although both Walruses were lost before the Second World War began. At one time she carried the unusual DH.82 Queen Bee which was a radio-controlled unmanned aircraft, normally used as a drone.

==Service==
&quot;Achilles&quot; was originally built for the Royal Navy, and was commissioned as HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; on 10 October 1933. She would serve with the Royal Navy&#x27;s New Zealand Division from 31 March 1936 up to the creation of the Royal New Zealand Navy, into which she was transferred in September 1941 and recommissioned HMNZS &quot;Achilles&quot;. About 60 per cent of her crew was from New Zealand.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, &quot;Achilles&quot; began patrolling the west coast of South America looking for German merchant ships, but by 22 October 1939 she had arrived at the Falkland Islands, where she was assigned to the South American Division under Commodore Henry Harwood and allocated to &quot;Force G&quot; (with &quot;Exeter&quot; and ).

===Battle of the River Plate===

In the early morning of 13 December 1939, a force consisting of &quot;Achilles&quot;, &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Exeter&quot; detected smoke on the horizon, which was confirmed at 06:16 to be a pocket battleship, thought to be the but which turned out to be . A fierce battle ensued, at a range of about . &quot;Achilles&quot; suffered some damage. In the exchange of fire, four crew were killed, her captain, WE Parry, was wounded; 36 of &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s crew were killed.

The range reduced to about at around 07:15 and &quot;Graf Spee&quot; broke off the engagement around 07:45 to head for the neutral harbour of Montevideo which she entered at 22:00 that night, having been pursued by &quot;Achilles&quot; and &quot;Ajax&quot; all day. &quot;Graf Spee&quot; was forced by international law to leave within 72 hours. Faced with what he believed to be overwhelming odds, the captain of &quot;Graf Spee&quot;, Hans Langsdorff, scuttled his ship rather than risk the lives of his crew. An ensign flag flown by HMNZS &quot;Achilles&quot; in the Battle of the River Plate was donated to Christ Church Cathedral in the Falkland Islands and is still on display hanging on the south wall of the Cathedral at Port Stanley.

===Pacific theatre===
Following the Atlantic battle, &quot;Achilles&quot; returned to Auckland, New Zealand, on 23 February 1940, where she underwent a refit until June. After German raider activity in the South Pacific in 1940 &quot;Achilles&quot; escorted the first Trans-Tasman commercial convoy, VK.1, composed of , , , and leaving Sydney 30 December 1940 for Auckland. After Japan entered the war, she escorted troop convoys, then joined the ANZAC Squadron in the south-west Pacific.

&quot;Achilles&quot; met , flagship of Rear-Admiral John G. Crace, and in December 1941 to form an escort for the Pensacola Convoy.

While operating off Guadalcanal Island with US Navy Task Force 67 on 5 January 1943, she was attacked by four Japanese aircraft. A bomb blew the top off X turret, killing 13 sailors. Between April 1943 and May 1944 &quot;Achilles&quot; was docked in Portsmouth, England for repairs and modernisation. Her single 4-inch AA guns were replaced by the dual-purpose QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun in four twin mountings, modern radar was fitted, and the damaged X turret was replaced by four QF 2 pom poms in a quadruple-mount. The work was delayed by a dockyard explosion that killed 14 men. Stoker William Dale was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving for his actions in saving the lives of several dockyard workers.

Sent back to the New Zealand Fleet, &quot;Achilles&quot; next joined the British Pacific Fleet in May 1945 for final operations in the Pacific War.

==Indian Navy==

After the war, &quot;Achilles&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy at Sheerness in Kent, England on 17 September 1946. She was then sold to the Indian Navy and recommissioned on 5 July 1948 as . She remained in service until decommissioned for scrap in Bombay on 30 June 1978. In 1968 she was present at the granting of independence to Mauritius representing the Indian Government together with the Royal Navy frigate under Captain Cameron Rusby. As part of the scrapping her Y turret was removed and presented as a gift to the New Zealand government. It is now on display at the entrance of Devonport Naval Base in Auckland. On 22 January 1979, Admiral Jal Cursetji, the Indian Navy Chief of the Naval Staff, presented &quot;Achilles&#x27;s&quot; builder&#x27;s plaque, steering wheel and engine room telegraph to Admiral Terence Lewin, the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff of the Royal Navy.

&quot;Achilles&quot; played herself in the film &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; in 1956.

<text>John Taylor (22 June 1704 – 4 April 1766), English classical scholar, was born at Shrewsbury in Shropshire, England.

==Life==
His father was a barber, and, by the generosity of one of his close customers, the son, having received his early education at the grammar school of his native town, was sent to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. In 1732, he was appointed librarian, and in 1734 Registrary of the university. Somewhat late in life he took orders and became rector of Lawford in Essex in 1751, Archdeacon of Buckingham in 1753, canon of St Paul&#x27;s in 1757. He died in London on 4 April 1766, aged 61 and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

He is also shown as Prebendary of Aylesbury from 1745 to 1747 and again from 1750 to 1756.

Taylor is best known for his editions of some of the Greek orators, chiefly valuable for the notes on Attic law, e.g. &quot;Lysias&quot; (1739); Demosthenes&#x27; &quot;Contra Leptinem&quot; (1741) and &quot;Contra Midiam&quot; (1743, with Lycurgus&#x27; &quot;Contra Leocratem&quot;), intended as specimens of a proposed edition, in five volumes, of the orations of Demosthenes, Aeschines, Dinarchus, and Demades, of which only vols. ii and iii were published.

Taylor also published (under the title of &quot;Marmor Sandvicense&quot;) a commentary on the inscription on an ancient marble brought from Greece by Lord Sandwich, containing particulars of the receipts and expenditures of the Athenian magistrates appointed to celebrate the festival of Apollo at Delos in 374 BC. His &quot;Elements of Civil Law&quot; (1755) also deserves notice. It was severely attacked by William Warburton in his &quot;Divine Legation of Moses&quot;, professedly owing to a difference of opinion in regard to the persecution of the early Christians, in reality because Taylor had spoken disparagingly of his scholarship.

<doc id="189688" wikidata="Q297576" url="?curid=189688" title="Hugues de Payens">
<text>&#x27;, better known by the French translation &#x27; or  ( – 24 May 1136), was the co-founder and first Grand Master of the Knights Templar. In association with Bernard of Clairvaux, he created the &quot;Latin Rule&quot;, the code of behavior for the Order.

== Name ==
The majority of the primary sources of information for his life are presented in medieval Latin, French or Italian. Latin sources call him . Some of his earliest purported appearances in documents are under the part-Latin, part-French name &quot;Hugo de Peans&quot; (1120–1125; details below), or in Italian as or . In later French works his name usually appears as or (), often translated into English as &quot;Hugh of Payens&quot; or &quot;Hugh de Payns&quot;.

Remarkably, Italian and French are literal translations of each other, both literally meaning &#x27;Hugh of the Pagans&#x27; (). Moreover, both his presumed origins (Nocera de&#x27; Pagani and Payns) are located in regions which were then named in Latin (, ).

== Origin and early life ==
There is no known early biography of Hugo de Paganis in existence, nor do later writers cite such a biography. None of the sources on his later career give details of his early life. Information is therefore scanty and uncertain; embellishments depend partly on documents that may not refer to the same individual, and partly on histories written decades or even centuries after his death.
There is long-dated claim that () came from Nocera de&#x27; Pagani in Campania, Southern Italy, historically supported by authors like Carlo Sigonio, Heinrich Pantaleon, Scipione Mazzella, Filiberto Campanile, Marco Antonio Guarini, Frans Mennens, Antonino Amico, Costantino Gaetani, Blaise François de Pagan, Pierre Dupuy, Bernardo Giustinian and Johann Jacob Hofmann.
Mentions of Nocera as his birthplace also appear in Baedeker&#x27;s &quot;Italy: handbook for travellers. Part 3&quot; (1869) and in the Old Catholic Encyclopedia (Volume 11) published by Robert Appleton Company in 1911. Multiple authors have stated that this claim is also supported by a letter Hugo supposedly wrote from Palestine in 1103, in which he talked of writing to &quot;my father in Nocera&quot; to tell him of the death of his cousin Alessandro.

The earliest source that details a geographical origin for the later Grand Master is the Old French translation of William of Tyre&#x27;s &quot;History of Events Beyond the Sea&quot;, dated to . The Latin text actually calls him simply , but the French translation by Paulin Paris, dated to 1879, describes him as (&quot;Hugh of Payens near Troyes&quot;), a reference to the village of Payns, about 10km from Troyes, in Champagne (eastern France).

In early documents of that region is mentioned as a witness to a donation by Count Hugh of Champagne in a document of 1085–90, indicating that the man was at least sixteen by this date—a legal adult and thus able to bear witness to legal documents—and so born no later than 1070. The same name appears on a number of other charters up to 1113 also relating to Count Hugh of Champagne, suggesting that or was a member of the Count&#x27;s court. By the year 1113, he was married to Elizabeth de Chappes, who bore him at least one child, Thibaud, later abbot of the Abbaye de la Colombe at Sens. The documents span Hugh&#x27;s lifetime and the disposition of his property after his death.

The one belated statement that the founder of the Knights Templars came from &quot;Payns near Troyes&quot; has some circumstantial confirmation. Bernard of Clairvaux, who favoured the Order and helped to compose its &quot;Latin Rule&quot;, also had the support of Hugh of Champagne. The &quot;Latin Rule&quot; of the Order was confirmed at the Council of Troyes in 1129. A Templar commandery was eventually built at Payns. Some scholars have however looked for Hugh&#x27;s origins elsewhere. There was an early claim that he came from the Vivarais (the district of Viviers in the modern of Ardèche). Hugh has also been identified with Hug de Pinós, third son of Galceran I, lord of Pinós in Catalonia; however, Galceran married only in 1090, far too late a date for him to be the father of the founder of the Knights Templars.

== The foundation of the Order ==

Hugh, Count of Champagne made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1104–07 and visited Jerusalem for a second time in 1114–16. It is probable that he was accompanied by Hugh of Payens, who remained there after the Count returned to France as there is a charter with &quot;Hugonis de Peans&quot; in the witness list from Jerusalem in 1120 and again in 1123. In 1125 his name appears again as a witness to a donation, this time accompanied by the title &quot;magister militum Templi&quot; (&quot;Master of the Knights of the Temple&quot;). He most likely obtained approval for the Order from King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Warmund, Patriarch of Jerusalem at the Council of Nablus in 1120.

One early chronicler, Simon de St. Bertin, implies that the Knights Templar originated earlier, before the death of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1100: &quot;While he [Godfrey] was reigning magnificently, some had decided not to return to the shadows of the world after suffering such dangers for God&#x27;s sake. On the advice of the princes of God&#x27;s army, they vowed themselves to God&#x27;s Temple under this rule: they would renounce the world, give up personal goods, free themselves to pursue purity, and lead a communal life wearing a poor habit, only using arms to defend the land against the attacks of the insurgent pagans when necessity demanded.&quot;

Later chroniclers write that Hugh of Payens approached King Baldwin II of Jerusalem (whose reign began in 1118) with eight knights, two of whom were brothers and all of whom were his relatives by either blood or marriage, in order to form the Order of the Knights Templar. The other knights were Godfrey de Saint-Omer, Payen de Montdidier, Archambaud de St. Amand, André de Montbard, Geoffrey Bison, and two men recorded only by the names of Rossal and Gondamer. Baldwin approved the foundation of the Order and entrusted the Temple of Jerusalem to its care.

Count Hugh of Champagne himself joined the Knights Templar on his third visit to the Holy Land in 1125.

In the late 1120s, Hugh of Payens, along with several other Templars, went on a diplomatic mission to western Europe on behalf of Baldwin II. They met with nobles and kings in an attempt to encourage warriors to come to the Kingdom of Jerusalem and join an attack on Damascus Baldwin was planning.

As Grand Master, Hugh of Payens led the Order for almost twenty years until his death, helping to establish the Order&#x27;s foundations as an important and influential military and financial institution. On his visit to England and Scotland in 1128, he raised men and money for the Order, and also founded their first House in London and another near Edinburgh at Balantrodoch, now known as Temple, Midlothian. The &quot;Latin Rule&quot; laying down the way of life of the Order, attributed to Hugh of Payens and Bernard of Clairvaux, was confirmed in 1129 at the Council of Troyes over which a papal legate, sent by Pope Honorius II, presided.

== Death ==
Hugh of Payens reportedly died in 1136, but the circumstances and date of his death are not recorded in any chronicle, though the Templars commemorated him every year on 24 May, and it is presumed that he died of old age. The 16th-century historian Marco Antonio Guarini claimed that Hugh was buried in the Church of San Giacomo in Ferrara. He was succeeded as Grand Master by Robert de Craon.

== In popular culture ==
It has recently been claimed that the wife of Hugues de Payens was Catherine St. Clair within the context of the alternative history of Rosslyn, such as in the pseudohistory of the &quot;Dossiers Secrets d&#x27;Henri Lobineau&quot; and the conspiracy theory of &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;.

Hugues is the main protagonist of the Jack Whyte novel &quot;Knights of the Black and White&quot;.

Hughes is mentioned on the TV series &quot;Knightfall&quot; in season 2, chapter 5.

<text>David Ruhnken (2 January 172314 May 1798) was a Dutch classical scholar of German origin.

==Origins==
Ruhnken was born in Bedlin (today Bydlino) near Stolp, Pomerania Province, (today Słupsk, Poland). After he had attended Latin school at Königsberg (1737–1741), his parents wanted him to enter the church, but after two years at the University of Wittenberg he determined to live the life of a scholar. At Wittenberg, Ruhnken studied with two distinguished professors, Johann Daniel Ritter and Johann Wilhelm von Berger. To them he owed a thorough grounding in ancient history and Roman antiquities and literature; and from them he learned a pure and vivid Latin style. At Wittenberg, Ruhnken also studied mathematics and Roman law.

The only thing that made him want to leave Wittenberg was a desire to explore Greek literature. Neither at Wittenberg nor at any other German university was Greek being seriously studied at the time. It was taught to students in divinity for the sake of the Greek New Testament and the early fathers of the church. Friedrich August Wolf was the real creator of Greek scholarship in modern Germany, and Richard Porson&#x27;s gibe that &quot;the Germans in Greek are sadly to seek&quot; had some truth in it.

==University of Leiden==
Ruhnken followed the advice of his friends at Wittenberg and early in 1744 went to the University of Leiden, where, stimulated by the influence of Richard Bentley, Tiberius Hemsterhuis had founded the only real school of Greek learning on the Continent since the days of Joseph Justus Scaliger and Isaac Casaubon. Hemsterhuis and Ruhnken were close friends during the twenty-three years between Ruhnken&#x27;s arrival in the Netherlands in 1743 and the death of Hemsterhuis in 1766. Ruhnken and Valckenaer were the two pupils of the great master on whom his inheritance must devolve.

As Ruhnken&#x27;s reputation spread, many efforts were made to attract him back to Germany, but after settling in Leiden, he only left the country once, when he spent a year in Paris, ransacking the public libraries (1755). For work achieved, this year of Ruhnken may compare even with the famous year which Ritschl spent in Italy.

In 1757 Ruhnken was appointed lecturer in Greek, to assist Hemsterhuis, and in 1761 he succeeded Oudendorp, with the title of &quot;ordinary professor of history and eloquence&quot;, as Latin professor. This promotion attracted the enmity of some native Netherlanders, who deemed themselves more worthy of the chair of Latin. Ruhnken&#x27;s defence was to publish works on Latin literature which eclipsed and silenced his rivals.

In 1766 Valckenaer succeeded Hemsterhuis in the Greek chair. The intimacy between the two colleagues was only broken by Valckenaer&#x27;s death in 1785, and stood the test of common candidature for the office (an important one at Leiden) of 12th Librarian of Leiden University, in which Ruhnken was successful. Ruhnken&#x27;s later years were clouded by severe domestic misfortune, and by the political commotions which, after the outbreak of the war with England in 1780, troubled the Netherlands without ceasing, and threatened to extinguish the University of Leiden.

==Character==
Soon after his Ruhnken&#x27;s death, his pupil Wyttenbach wrote his biography. He wrote that Ruhnken was not a recluse or a pedant, but was sociable and cared nothing for rank. Wyttenbach said of him in his early days that he knew how to sacrifice to the Sirens without proving traitor to the Muses. Life in the open air had a great attraction for him; he was fond of sport, and would sometimes devote to it two or three days in the week. In his bearing towards other scholars Ruhnken was generous and dignified, distributing literary aid with a free hand, and meeting onslaughts for the most part with a smile. In the records of learning he occupies an important position, as a principal link in the chain which connects Bentley with the modern scholarship of the European Continent. The spirit and the aims of Hemsterhuis, the great reviver of Continental learning, were committed to his trust, and were faithfully maintained. He greatly widened the circle of those who valued taste and precision in classical scholarship. He powerfully aided the emancipation of Greek studies from theology. Ruhnken was one of the first scholars of the 18th century to study and interpret Plato&#x27;s writings in ancient Greek rather than interpreting Plato&#x27;s works through the prisms of translations by others.

==Works==
Ruhnken&#x27;s principal works are editions of:
#Timaeus&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon of Platonic Words&quot; (1st ed. 1754 with commentary; 2nd ed. 1789; there appeared a revision of the second edition by Georg Aenotheus Koch in 1828)
#Thalelaeus and other Greek commentators on Roman law
#Rutilius Lupus and other grammarians
#Velleius Paterculus
#the works of Muretus.

He also occupied himself much with the history of Greek literature, particularly the oratorical literature, with the Homeric hymns, the &quot;scholia&quot; or, Plato and the Greek and Roman grammarians and rhetoricians. A discovery famous in its time was that in the text of the work of Apsines on rhetoric a large piece of a work by Longinus was embedded. Modern views of the writings attributed to Longinus have lessened the interest of this discovery without lessening its merit.

<doc id="189692" wikidata="Q243362" url="?curid=189692" title="Baphomet">
<text>Baphomet is a figure incorporated across various occult and Western esoteric traditions. During trials starting in 1307, the Knights Templar were accused of heresy for worshipping Baphomet as a demonic idol. Baphomet subsequently resurfaced during 19th century speculation and debate regarding the suppression of the Templars, with various occult and mystical traditions claiming Baphomet as a symbol of balance and synthesis, originating in teachings of the Gnostics, while others maintained Baphomet as a profane deity. Since 1856 the figure of Baphomet has been associated with the Sabbatic Goat illustration by Éliphas Lévi, composed of binary elements representing the &quot;symbolization of the equilibrium of opposites&quot;: both human and animal, both masculine and feminine, combined in metaphysical unity. Lévi&#x27;s intention was to symbolize his concept of balance, with Baphomet representing the goal of perfect social order.

== History ==

The name &quot;Baphomet&quot; appeared in July 1098 in a letter about the siege of Antioch by the French Crusader Anselm of Ribemont:

Raymond of Aguilers, a chronicler of the First Crusade, reports that the troubadours used the term &quot;Bafomet&quot; for Muhammad, and &quot;Bafumaria&quot; for a mosque. The name &quot;Bafometz&quot; later appeared around 1195 in the Provençal poems by the troubadour Gavaudan. Around 1250, a Provençal poem by Austorc d&#x27;Aorlhac bewailing the defeat of the Seventh Crusade again uses the name &quot;Bafomet&quot; for Muhammad. is also the title of one of four surviving chapters of an Occitan translation of Ramon Llull&#x27;s earliest known work, the .

Baphomet was allegedly worshipped as a deity by the medieval order of the Knights Templar. King Philip IV of France had many French Templars simultaneously arrested, and then tortured into confessions in October 1307. The name &quot;Baphomet&quot; appeared in trial transcripts for the Inquisition of the Knights Templar that same year. Over 100 different charges had been leveled against the Templars, including heresy, homosexual relations, spitting and urinating on the cross, and sodomy. Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the Cathars and many of King Philip&#x27;s enemies; he had earlier kidnapped Pope Boniface VIII and charged him with nearly identical offenses. Yet Malcolm Barber observes that historians &quot;find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication&quot;. The &quot;Chinon Parchment suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross&quot;, says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the Saracens, where they were taught how to commit apostasy &quot;with the mind only and not with the heart&quot;. Similarly, Michael Haag suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation rite:

The name &quot;Baphomet&quot; comes up in several of these dubious confessions. Peter Partner states in his 1987 book &quot;The Knights Templar and their Myth&quot;: &quot;In the trial of the Templars one of their main charges was their supposed worship of a heathen idol-head known as a &quot;Baphomet&quot; (Baphomet = Mahomet).&quot; The description of the object changed from confession to confession; some Templars denied any knowledge of it, while others, who confessed under torture, described it as being either a severed head, a cat, or a head with three faces. The Templars did possess several silver-gilt heads as reliquaries, including one marked , another said to be St. Euphemia, and possibly the actual head of Hugues de Payens. The claims of an idol named &quot;Baphomet&quot; were unique to the Inquisition of the Templars. Karen Ralls, author of the &quot;Knights Templar Encyclopedia&quot;, argues that it is significant that &quot;no specific evidence [of Baphomet] appears in either the Templar Rule or in other medieval period Templar documents.&quot;

The name &quot;Baphomet&quot; came into popular English usage in the 19th century during debate and speculation on the reasons for the suppression of the Templars. Modern scholars agree that the name of Baphomet was an Old French corruption of the name &quot;Mohammed&quot;, with the interpretation being that some of the Templars, through their long military occupation of the Outremer, had begun incorporating Islamic ideas into their belief system, and that this was seen and documented by the Inquisitors as heresy. Alain Demurger, however, rejects the idea that the Templars could have adopted the doctrines of their enemies. Helen Nicholson writes that the charges were essentially &quot;manipulative&quot;—the Templars &quot;were accused of becoming fairy-tale Muslims&quot;. Medieval Christians believed that Muslims were idolatrous and worshipped Muhammad as a god, with &quot;mahomet&quot; becoming &quot;&quot; in English, meaning an idol or false god (see also Medieval Christian views on Muhammad). This idol-worship is attributed to Muslims in several . For example, one finds the gods in a Provençal poem on the life of St. Honorat, completed in 1300. In the , written before 1235, a Saracen idol is called &quot;Bafumetz&quot;.

==Alternative etymologies==
While modern scholars and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; state that the origin of the name Baphomet was a probable Old French version of &quot;Mahomet&quot;, alternative etymologies have also been proposed.

In the 18th century, speculative theories arose that sought to tie the Knights Templar with the origins of Freemasonry. Bookseller, Freemason and Illuminatus Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (1733–1811), in (1782), was the first to claim that the Templars were Gnostics, and that &quot;Baphomet&quot; was formed from the Greek words , , to mean , &quot;Baptism of Wisdom&quot;. Nicolai &quot;attached to it the idea of the image of the supreme God, in the state of quietude attributed to him by the Manichaean Gnostics&quot;, according to F. J. M. Raynouard, and &quot;supposed that the Templars had a secret doctrine and initiations of several grades&quot;, which &quot;the Saracens had communicated ... to them&quot;. He further connected the &quot;figura Baffometi&quot; with the Pythagorean pentacle:

Émile Littré (1801–1881) in asserted that the word was cabalistically formed by writing backward &quot;tem. o. h. p. ab&quot;, an abbreviation of , &quot;abbot, or father of the temple of peace of all men&quot;. His source is the &quot;Abbé Constant&quot;, which is to say, Alphonse-Louis Constant, the real name of Eliphas Lévi.

Hugh J. Schonfield (1901–1988), one of the scholars who worked on the Dead Sea Scrolls, argued in his book &quot;The Essene Odyssey&quot; that the word &quot;Baphomet&quot; was created with knowledge of the Atbash substitution cipher, which substitutes the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet for the last, the second for the second last, and so on. &quot;Baphomet&quot; rendered in Hebrew is (&quot;bpwmt&quot;); interpreted using Atbash, it becomes (&quot;šwpy‘&quot;, &quot;Shofya&#x27;&quot;), which can be interpreted as the Greek word &quot;Sophia&quot;, meaning &quot;wisdom&quot;. This theory appears as an important plot point in the novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, although it was recently questioned by the French historian Thierry Murcia, who challenges the method of calculation used by Schonfield.

==Joseph Freiherr von Hammer-Purgstall==
In 1818, the name Baphomet appeared in the essay by the Viennese Orientalist Joseph Freiherr von Hammer-Purgstall, (&quot;Discovery of the Mystery of Baphomet, by which the Knights Templars, like the Gnostics and Ophites, are convicted of Apostasy, of Idolatry and of moral Impurity, by their own Monuments&quot;), which presented an elaborate pseudohistory constructed to discredit Templarist Masonry and, by extension, Freemasonry. Following Nicolai, he argued, using as archaeological evidence &quot;Baphomets&quot; faked by earlier scholars and literary evidence such as the Grail romances, that the Templars were Gnostics and the &quot;Templars&#x27; head&quot; was a Gnostic idol called &quot;Baphomet:&quot;

Hammer&#x27;s essay did not pass unchallenged, and F. J. M. Raynouard published an in the following year. Charles William King criticized Hammer, saying that he had been deceived by &quot;the paraphernalia of ... Rosicrucian or alchemical quacks&quot;, and Peter Partner agreed that the images &quot;may have been forgeries from the occultist workshops&quot;. At the very least, there was little evidence to tie them to the Knights Templar—in the 19th century some European museums acquired such pseudo-Egyptian objects, which were cataloged as &quot;Baphomets&quot; and credulously thought to have been idols of the Templars.

==Éliphas Lévi==

Later in the 19th century, the name of Baphomet became further associated with the occult. Éliphas Lévi published (&quot;Dogma and Rituals of High Magic&quot;) as two volumes ( 1854, 1856), in which he included an image he had drawn himself, which he described as Baphomet and &quot;The Sabbatic Goat&quot;, showing a winged humanoid goat with a pair of breasts and a torch on its head between its horns (see the illustration). This image has become the best-known representation of Baphomet. Lévi considered the Baphomet to be a depiction of the absolute in symbolic form and explicated in detail his symbolism in the drawing that served as the frontispiece:

===Witches&#x27; Sabbath===
Lévi&#x27;s depiction of Baphomet is similar to that of The Devil in the early Tarot. Lévi, working with correspondences different from those later used by S. L. MacGregor Mathers, &quot;equated the Devil Tarot key with Mercury&quot;, giving &quot;his figure Mercury&#x27;s caduceus, rising like a phallus from his groin&quot;. The symbol is said to have originated when Mercury / Hermes once attempted to stop a fight between two snakes by throwing his rod at them, whereupon they twined themselves around the rod. The word Caduceus is from the Greek root meaning &quot;herald’s wand&quot; and was also a badge of diplomatic ambassadors and became associated with commerce, eloquence, alchemy, thievery, and lying. The etymology of Caduceus is from Doric Greek , from the Greek meaning &quot;herald&quot;.

Lévi believed that the alleged devil worship of the medieval Witches&#x27; Sabbath was a perpetuation of ancient pagan rites. A goat with a candle between its horns appears in medieval witchcraft records, and other pieces of lore are cited in :

Lévi&#x27;s Baphomet may have been partly inspired by grotesque carvings on the Templar churches of Lanleff in Brittany and Saint-Merri in Paris, which depict squatting bearded men with bat wings, female breasts, horns and the shaggy hindquarters of a beast.

===Socialism, romanticism, and magnetism===
Lévi&#x27;s references to the School of Alexandria and the Templars can be explained against the background of debates about the origins and character of true Christianity. It has been pointed out that these debates included contemporary forms of Romantic socialism, or Utopian socialism, which were seen as the heirs of the Gnostics, Templars, and other mystics. Lévi, being himself an adherent of these schools since the 1840s, regarded the socialists and Romantics (such as Alphonse de Lamartine) as the successors of this alleged tradition of true religion. In fact, his narrative mirrors historiographies of socialism, including the (1847) by his best friend and political comrade Alphonse Esquiros. Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by Lévi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the &quot;emancipation of humanity&quot; and the establishment of a perfect social order.

In Lévi&#x27;s writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called &quot;spiritualist magnetism&quot;: theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a &quot;synthesis&quot; of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism. Spiritualist magnetists with a socialist background include the Baron du Potet and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for Lévi. At the same time, Lévi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux, who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers. The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:

===Goat of Mendes===
Mendes is the Greek name for the ancient Egyptian city of Djedet. Lévi equates his image with &quot;The Goat of Mendes&quot;, possibly following the account by Herodotus that the god of Mendes was depicted with a goat&#x27;s face and legs. Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly copulated with a goat. The chief deities of Mendes were the ram deity Banebdjedet (lit. &quot;Ba of the Lord of Djedet&quot;), who was the Ba of Osiris, and his consort, the fish goddess Hatmehit, with both deities being worshipped in Lower Egypt. Khnum was the equivalent god in Upper Egypt.

Khnum was typically portrayed with the horns of a ram, one of the sacred animals worshiped in Ancient Egypt, representing aspects such as fertility, rebirth, regeneration, and resurrection. He was originally illustrated with horizontally spiraled horns (based on the Ancient Egyptian corkscrew-horned sheep, an extinct subspecies of the barbary sheep), but his representation later evolved to feature the down-turned horns of Ammon in the New Kingdom (based on the extinct sheep subspecies &quot;Ovis platyra palaeoaegyptiacus&quot;).

E. A. Wallis Budge writes:

The link between Baphomet and the pagan god Pan was also observed by Aleister Crowley as well as Anton LaVey:

==Aleister Crowley==

The Baphomet of Lévi was to become an important figure within the cosmology of Thelema, the mystical system established by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century. Baphomet features in the Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church recited by the congregation in &quot;The Gnostic Mass&quot;, in the sentence: &quot;And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mysteries, in His name BAPHOMET.&quot;

In &quot;Magick (Book 4)&quot;, Crowley asserted that Baphomet was a divine androgyne and &quot;the hieroglyph of arcane perfection&quot;, seen as that which reflects: &quot;What occurs above so reflects below, or As above so below&quot;:

For Crowley, Baphomet is further a representative of the spiritual nature of the Spermatozoon, while also being symbolic of the &quot;magical child&quot; produced as a result of sex magic. As such, Baphomet represents the Union of Opposites, especially as mystically personified in Chaos and Babalon combined and biologically manifested with the sperm and egg united in the zygote.

Crowley proposed that Baphomet was derived from &quot;Father Mithras&quot;. In his &quot;Confessions&quot; he describes the circumstances that led to this etymology:

==Modern interpretations and usage==
Lévi&#x27;s Baphomet is the source of the later tarot image of the Devil in the Rider–Waite design. The concept of a downward-pointing pentagram on its forehead was enlarged upon by Lévi in his discussion (without illustration) of the Goat of Mendes arranged within such a pentagram, which he contrasted with the microcosmic man arranged within a similar but upright pentagram. The actual image of a goat in a downward-pointing pentagram first appeared in the 1897 book , written by the French occultist Stanislas de Guaita. It was this image that was later adopted as the official symbol—called the Sigil of Baphomet—of the Church of Satan, and continues to be used among Satanists.

Baphomet, as Lévi&#x27;s illustration suggests, has occasionally been portrayed as a synonym of Satan or a demon, a member of the hierarchy of Hell. Baphomet appears in that guise as a character in James Blish&#x27;s &quot;The Day After Judgment&quot;. Christian evangelist Jack T. Chick claimed that Baphomet is a demon worshipped by Freemasons, a claim that apparently originated with the Taxil hoax. Lévi&#x27;s Baphomet was depicted on the cover of , Léo Taxil&#x27;s lurid paperback &quot;exposé&quot; of Freemasonry, which, in 1897, he revealed as a hoax intended to ridicule the Catholic Church and its anti-Masonic propaganda.

In 2014, The Satanic Temple commissioned an statue of Baphomet to stand alongside a monument of the Ten Commandments at the Oklahoma State Capitol, citing &quot;respect for diversity and religious minorities&quot; as reasons for the monument. (The Oklahoma Supreme Court ultimately declared religious displays illegal.) The Baphomet statue was unveiled in Detroit on 25 July 2015, as a symbol of the modern Satanist movement. The Satanic Temple transported the Baphomet statue to Little Rock, Arkansas, where another 10 Commandments monument had been recently installed; the statue was publicly displayed during a Temple demonstration on 16 August 2018.

===In popular culture===
In &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–34) by Thomas Carlyle, protagonist Diogenes Teufelsdröckh describes his spiritual rebirth as a &quot;Baphometic Fire-baptism&quot;. Clive Barker&#x27;s novel &quot;Cabal&quot; (1988) and its film adaption, &quot;Nightbreed&quot; (1990), Baphomet is depicted as the god worshipped by the Night Breed creatures.

Baphomet appears as a recurring antagonist in the long-running German novel series &quot;Geisterjäger John Sinclair&quot;, in which he is the master of Vincent van Akkeren and his cult of renegade Knights Templar. The horror novels by author Jason Dark portray Baphomet as one of the three entities that form the unholy trinity of Lucifer, with the other two being Asmodis and Beelzebub.

The 2016 audio drama &quot;Robin of Sherwood: The Knights Of The Apocalypse&quot; (based on the TV show &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot;), has Robin and his companions come into conflict with the titular Knights. The Knights of the Apocalypse are depicted as a cult which worships Baphomet; the Knights are also depicted as a splinter group from the Knights Templar.

<text>The Battle of the River Plate (a.k.a. Pursuit of the Graf Spee in the United States) is a 1956 British war film in Technicolor and VistaVision by the writer-director-producer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The film stars John Gregson, Anthony Quayle, Bernard Lee and Peter Finch. It was distributed worldwide by Rank Film Distributors Ltd.

The film&#x27;s storyline concerns the Battle of the River Plate, an early World War II naval engagement in 1939 between a Royal Navy force of three cruisers and the German pocket battleship .

==Plot==
In the early months of the Second World War, Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; sends out merchant raiders to attack Allied shipping. The British Royal Navy responds with hunting groups whose mission is to stop these attacks. In time, the German battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; is discovered in the Atlantic, just off South America, by a trio of British cruisers. With its speed and destructive firepower, &quot;Graf Spee&quot; is a formidable menace. Nevertheless, the British go straight into attack, closing swiftly to minimise the &quot;Graf Spee&#x27;s&quot; substantial advantage in gun range. The British use their superior numbers to split her fire by attacking from different directions. But &quot;Graf Spee&quot;, under Captain Hans Langsdorff (Peter Finch), inflicts much damage on her foes. One of them, HMS &quot;Exeter&quot;, is particularly hard hit and is forced to retire to the Falklands for repair.

For her own part, the &quot;Graf Spee&quot; sustains some damage and takes refuge in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, for repairs. According to international law, the ship may remain in a neutral harbour only long enough to repair for seaworthiness, not to refit for battle; any overstay will lead to the ship and its crew being interned for the duration of the war. The British initially demand the Uruguayan authorities send &quot;Graf Spee&quot; out to sea within 24 hours, but once they recognise that reinforcements can arrive for an impending second battle they change strategy and lobby for an extension for the Germans. In reality the most powerful British ships are still extremely distant, but local media spreads false reports that more Royal Navy warships have arrived, including battleships and aircraft carriers; in fact, only three cruisers (&quot;Exeter&quot; having been replaced by ) lie in wait.

Taken in by the ruse, Langsdorff takes his ship out with a skeleton crew aboard. As the onlookers watch from shore, she heads down the River Plate for the open sea and then bursts into flames from a series of explosions. It is obvious that Langsdorf has ordered that his ship be scuttled. This is a relief to the Royal Navy fleet, which reports, &quot;Many a life has been saved today&quot;. At story&#x27;s end, Langsdorff is personally complimented by the British for his humane decision.

==Production==
&quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; had its genesis in an invitation to Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger to attend a film festival in Argentina in 1954. They decided they could not afford to take the time from their schedules unless it was a working holiday, and used the trip to research the defeat of . They came across the &quot;hook&quot; for their story when one of the surviving British naval officers gave Pressburger a copy of Captain Patrick Dove&#x27;s book &quot;I Was Graf Spee&#x27;s Prisoner&quot;, published in 1940., which became the basis of the human story of the film.

Principal photography began on 13 December 1955, the 16th anniversary of the battle. The HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; and River Plate Association reportedly sent a message to the producers: &quot;Hope your shooting will be as successful as ours&quot;. Location shooting for the arrival and departure of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; took place at the port of Montevideo, using thousands of locals as extras. However, the scenes showing &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; sailing from Montevideo were shot in the Grand Harbour at Valletta in Malta, and the launch taking McCall out to HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; was filmed in Mġarr harbour on Gozo, Malta&#x27;s northern island.

Two songs written by composer Brian Easdale were used in the film, &quot;Dolores&#x27; Song&quot; and &quot;Rio de la Plata&quot;. Both were acted by April Olrich as &quot;Dolores&quot;, with singing voice dubbed by Muriel Smith.

==Ships used==
* played by heavy cruiser which retained its USN bow number, 139, for the film. This was explained by Captain Langsdorff as part of its camouflage to confuse other ships. One of three heavy cruisers of the , she is now a museum ship in Massachusetts.
* Supply ship played by the fleet oiler 
* , flagship, played by 
* played by 
* played by herself (at the time in service with the Indian Navy as )
* played by herself when she joins the British squadron after the battle, (and by HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot; in the final scenes off Montevideo)
* German freighter &quot;Tacoma&quot;, which took the crew off &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; before scuttling, played by 
* Gunboat &quot;Uruguay&quot;, boarding the &quot;Tacoma&quot;, was played by a British &quot;Ton&quot;-class minesweeper
* used for the firing of some of the guns, and to depict the explosions on the foredeck of &quot;Exeter&quot;, and as &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; during the replenishment scene with &quot;Altmark&quot;, as well as the scene on the deck of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; showing the flag-draped coffins of dead German sailors laid out for burial in Montevideo 
* Destroyers and used as camera ships. The latter remained in service for many decades after the film, not being scrapped until 2016 after being transferred to the South Korea Navy in 1978.

Most of the action of the battle and prior to it takes place on real ships at sea. The producers had the advantage of having elements of the Mediterranean Fleet of the Royal Navy available for their use, and USS &quot;Salem&quot; to play the part of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, although she had a different number of main turrets. The producers did make use of a model of &quot;Salem&quot; (with details only on the side being shot) in a -deep tank at Pinewood Studios for scenes depicting hits during the battle, and also for the blowing-up of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, which was assembled from multiple takes from different angles.

In an early scene, it is claimed that &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; is being disguised by the ship&#x27;s carpenters – using features such as a false funnel – as an American cruiser, a trick typical of commerce raiders. The US Navy would not allow any Nazi insignia to be displayed on &quot;Salem&quot; so the wartime German flag being hoisted and flown was filmed on a British ship. This is also the explanation as to why the crew of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; are seen wearing US Navy pattern helmets rather than German &quot;Coal Scuttles&quot; – whilst the filmmakers wanted to achieve an accurate impression and use German helmets they were refused permission. This aspect is sometimes described as a &quot;goof&quot; on the part of the filmmakers, but was in fact a circumstance beyond their control. Mention is made of &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s sister ships, &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and &quot;Deutschland&quot;. &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; capsized after an air raid in 1945 and the remains of the wreck buried under a new harbor. &quot;Deutschland&quot; was renamed &quot;Lutzow&quot; in 1940 and sunk as a target in 1947.

Two of the original ships, HMNZS &quot;Achilles&quot; and HMS &quot;Cumberland&quot; were available for filming 15 years after the events depicted. &quot;Cumberland&quot; was a disarmed trial ship without her 8-inch gun turrets at this time and was refitted with lattice masts, but is recognizable as the last of the three-funneled heavy cruisers to remain in service. (In the final scenes, &quot;Jamaica&quot; represented &quot;Cumberland&quot; as one of the British trio waiting off Montevideo). This use of real warships was in line with an Admiralty policy of co-operation with film-makers, which saw the corvettes HMS &quot;Coreopsis&quot; and reactivated in 1952 for the film version of &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;; the cruiser and the minelayer used in the 1953 film &quot;Sailor of the King&quot;, and the destroyer and frigate used in the 1955 film &quot;Yangtse Incident: The Story of H.M.S. Amethyst&quot;.

&quot;Achilles&quot; had been sold to the newly formed Indian Navy in 1948, becoming INS &quot;Delhi&quot;. The flagship HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; was her sister ship, and would have looked identical to &quot;Achilles&quot;, while the original HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; was a two-funnelled half-sister of &quot;Cumberland&quot;. HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; and HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot;, which played &quot;Ajax&quot; and &quot;Exeter&quot;, had higher superstructures and more guns, which were mounted in triple turrets. Though different from the ships they represented, both these light cruisers had played a major part in the wartime campaign against the large German surface raiders which began at the Battle of the River Plate, including in 1941, in 1942, in 1943, and in 1944.

==Historical details==
The use of real ships allows the film to pay particular attention to detail even though &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; was portrayed by the American heavy cruiser , which mounted 3&quot; smaller main guns, is considerably greater in tonnage, 100&#x27; longer, and quite visually distinct (in bow, shearline, and having two forward triple turrets instead of the single forward turret of the s) from the German Pocket Battleship. This emphasis on realism includes the warning bells ringing before each salvo, the scorching on the gun barrels after the battle, and the accurate depiction of naval procedures. The film depicts &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; and &quot;Altmark&quot; using the complex procedure of alongside refueling; actually the Germans used the slower but safer method of astern refuelling, but the alongside method is much more dramatic for film purposes, and by 1955 was standard procedure for the British ships involved (see list above). Similarly, although the scene when Harwood meets with his captains on board &quot;Ajax&quot; is fictional, it was created for the movie in order to explain the tactical situation to the audience. The battle is seen from the perspective of the British ships, and that of the prisoners captured from nine merchantmen and held in &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;.

The film devotes nearly 20 minutes to the battle, which actually lasted a little more than an hour before becoming a chase into Montevideo. The initial minutes from the spotting of &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; at 0614, to her opening fire at 0618, and the British ships returning fire from 0620 are depicted in real time. In reality German gunfire did not &quot;straddle&quot; &quot;Exeter&quot; until 0623, after three salvoes, and her main armament fire was not &quot;split&quot; between the British ships until 0630, although these events are shown happening immediately. &quot;Exeter&quot;″s bridge and forward turrets were knocked out at 0630, but at this point the film begins to telescope the sequence of events.

Commodore Harwood is shown wearing the sleeve rings of a rear admiral from the start, although he was only promoted to this rank after the battle. This is historically correct, as &#x27;Commodores of the first class&#x27; wore those insignia at the time. &quot;Exeter&quot;″s chaplain is also correctly depicted wearing a civilian dark suit and clerical collar; it was not until later in the war that naval chaplains adopted military uniform as a security measure.

&quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; only obliquely hints at one aspect of the story: the death of Captain Hans Langsdorff after he scuttled his ship. In the film Langsdorff is shown as subdued and depressed afterwards. In reality he was taken ashore to the Naval Hotel in Buenos Aires, where he wrote letters to his family and superiors. He then lay atop &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;″s battle ensign and shot himself, forestalling allegations that he had avoided further battle action through cowardice; another motivation was his desire, as &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;″s captain, to symbolically go down with his ship. He was talked out of this by his officers, who convinced him that his leadership was still needed in seeking amnesty for his crew. Once their fate was decided, Langsdorff took his own life.

Captain Langsdorff was buried in the German section of the La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was honoured by both sides in the battle for his honourable conduct.
Prior to the destruction of the &quot;Graf Spee&quot;, the German crew were seen rowing away from the ship whereas in reality they were taken off by an Argentine tugboat. Also not shown is the use of certain captured merchant vessels as prizes, sailed by crews from &quot;Graf Spee&quot; to carry captured sailors, which were later sunk. In addition a Norwegian merchant ship reported the &quot;Graf Spee&quot; heading for South America before being spotted by lookouts but this is omitted. Furthermore the British Government secretly arranged for French and British merchant ships to leave Montevideo harbour every 24 hours to delay &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s departure. Also omitted is &quot;Graf Spee&quot; attempting to force a merchant ship to stop while she herself was being pursued by the British cruisers.

==Release and reception==
When &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; was completed and screened for executives at the Rank Organisation, it was received so well that it was decided to hold the release of the film for a year, so that it could be chosen as part of the next year&#x27;s Royal Film Performance (in 1956), since 1955&#x27;s film had already been selected. The royal premiere was held at the Empire Theatre, Leicester Square (now Cineworld) on 29 October 1956 in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret, Marilyn Monroe, and Victor Mature.

===Box office===
The film performed very well at the box office, being the fourth most popular film in Britain in 1957, after &quot;High Society&quot;, &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; and &quot;The Admirable Crichton&quot;.

===Critical opinion===
At the time of &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot;&#x27;s release, F. Maurice Speed writing in &quot;What&#x27;s On In London&quot; described it as &quot;Long, meticulous in its Naval detail, a little confusing sometimes to the landlubber like myself, [but] wonderfully photographed&quot;, adding that &quot;some of the best scenes are the earlier quieter ones between Capt. Langsdorff (&quot;Graf Spee&quot;) and his prisoner Captain Dove (Bernard Lee). Finch, Lee, John Gregson (Capt. of the gallant &quot;&quot;Exeter&quot;) and Anthony Quayle (of the &quot;Ajax&quot;&quot;) all give performances above the average.&quot;

Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; described &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; as &quot;almost unrelievedly dreadful&quot;.

==Honours==
&quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; was nominated for three BAFTA Awards in 1957, for &quot;Best British Film&quot;, &quot;Best British Screenplay&quot; and &quot;Best Film From Any Source&quot;.

==Book==

In 1956 Powell published &quot;Graf Spee&quot; with Hodder and Stoughton, a.k.a. &quot;Death in the Atlantic&quot; (Rinehart, US), retelling the story of the film in more detail. In 1976, a second edition was released by White Lion Publishers with the amended title, &quot;The Last Voyage of the Graf Spee&quot;.

<text>A fire sprinkler system is an active fire protection method, consisting of a water supply system providing adequate pressure and flowrate to a water distribution piping system, to which fire sprinklers are connected. Although initially used only in factories and large commercial buildings, systems for homes and small buildings are now available at a cost-effective price. 

Fire sprinkler systems are extensively used worldwide, with over 40 million sprinkler heads fitted each year. Fire sprinkler systems are generally designed as a life saving system, but are not necessarily designed to protect the building. Of buildings completely protected by fire sprinkler systems, if a fire did initiate, it was controlled by the fire sprinklers alone in 96% of these cases.

== History ==

Leonardo da Vinci designed a sprinkler system in the 15th century. Leonardo automated his patron&#x27;s kitchen with a super-oven and a system of conveyor belts. In a comedy of errors, everything went wrong during a huge banquet, and a fire broke out. &quot;The sprinkler system worked all too well, causing a flood that washed away all the food and a good part of the kitchen.&quot;

Ambrose Godfrey created the first successful automated sprinkler system in 1723. He used gunpowder to release a tank of extinguishing fluid.

The world&#x27;s first modern recognizable sprinkler system was installed in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in the United Kingdom in 1812 by its architect, William Congreve, and was covered by patent No. 3606 dated the same year. The apparatus consisted of a cylindrical airtight reservoir of 400 hogsheads (c. 95,000 litres) fed by a water main which branched to all parts of the theatre. A series of smaller pipes fed from the distribution pipe were pierced with a series of holes which would pour water in the event of a fire.

Frederick Grinnell improved Henry S. Parmalee&#x27;s design and in 1881 patented the automatic sprinkler that bears his name. He continued to improve the device and in 1890 invented the glass disc sprinkler, essentially the same as that in use today.

Until the 1940s, sprinklers were installed almost exclusively for the protection of commercial buildings, whose owners were generally able to recoup their expenses with savings in insurance costs. Over the years, fire sprinklers have become mandatory safety equipment&quot; in some parts of North America, in certain occupancies, including, but not limited to newly constructed &quot;hospitals, schools, hotels and other public buildings&quot;, subject to the local building codes and enforcement. However, outside of the US and Canada, sprinklers have rarely been mandated by building codes for normal hazard occupancies which do not have large numbers of occupants (e.g. factories, process lines, retail outlets, petrol stations, etc.)

Sprinklers are now commonly installed in non-industrial buildings, including schools and residential premises. This is largely as a result of lobbying by the National Fire Sprinkler Network, the European Fire Sprinkler Network, and the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association.
==Usage==
Sprinklers have been in use in the United States since 1874, and were installed in factory applications where fires at the turn of the century were often catastrophic in terms of both human and property losses. 

Sprinklers may be required to be installed by building codes, or may be recommended by insurance companies to reduce potential property losses or business interruption. US building codes for places of assembly (generally over 100 persons) and places with overnight sleeping accommodation such as hotels, nursing homes, dormitories, and hospitals, usually require sprinklers either under local building codes, as a condition of receiving State and Federal funding, or as a requirement to obtain certification (essential for institutions who wish to train medical staff).

== Regulations ==

=== United States ===
The primary fire code writing organization is the private National Fire Protection Association or NFPA. NFPA sets the standards for technical aspects of sprinklers installed in the USA. Building codes, which specify which buildings require sprinklers are generally left to local jurisdictions. However, there are some exceptions:

In 1990 the US passed PL-101-391, better known as the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990. This law requires that any hotel, meeting hall, or similar institution that receives federal funds (i.e. for overnight stay, or a conference, etc.), must meet fire and other safety requirements. The most visible of these conditions is the implementation of sprinklers. As more and more hotels and other public accommodations upgraded their facilities to enable business with government visitors, this type of construction became the de facto industry norm – even when not directly mandated by any local building codes.

If building codes do not explicitly mandate the use of fire sprinklers, the code often makes it highly advantageous to install them as an optional system. Most US building codes allow for less-expensive construction materials, larger floor area limitations, longer egress paths, and fewer requirements for fire-rated construction in structures which are protected by fire sprinklers. Consequently, the total building cost is often decreased by installing a sprinkler system and saving money in the other aspects of the project, as compared to building a non-sprinklered structure.

In 2011, Pennsylvania and California became the first US states to require sprinkler systems in all new residential construction. However, Pennsylvania repealed the law later that same year. Many municipalities now require residential sprinklers, even if they are not required at the state level.

===Europe===
In Norway as of July 2010, all new housing of more than two storeys, all new hotels, care homes, and hospitals must be sprinklered. Other Nordic countries require or soon will require sprinklers in new care homes, and in Finland a third of care homes were retrofitted with sprinklers. A fire in an illegal immigrant detention center at Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands on 27 October 2005 killed 11 detainees, and led to the retrofitting of sprinklers in all similarly-designed prisons in the Netherlands. A fire at Düsseldorf Airport on 11 April 1996 which killed 17 people led to sprinklers being retrofitted in all major German airports. Most European countries also require sprinklers in shopping centers, in large warehouses, and in high-rise buildings.

Renewed interest in and support for sprinkler systems in the UK has resulted in sprinkler systems being more widely installed. In schools, for example, the government has issued recommendations through &quot;Building Bulletin 100&quot;, a design guide for fire safety in schools, that most new schools, except for a few low risk schools, should be constructed with sprinkler protection. In 2011, Wales became the first country in the world where sprinklers are compulsory in all new homes. The law applies to newly built houses and blocks of flats, as well as care homes and university halls of residence. In Scotland, all new schools are sprinklered, as are new care homes, sheltered housing and high rise flats.

In the UK, since the 1990s sprinklers have gained recognition within the Building Regulations (England and Wales) and Scottish Building Standards and under certain circumstances, the presence of sprinkler systems is deemed to provide a form of alternative compliance to some parts of the codes. For example, the presence of a sprinkler system will usually permit doubling of compartment sizes and increases in travel distances (to fire exits) as well as allowing a reduction in the fire rating of internal compartment walls.

== Operation ==

Each closed-head sprinkler is held closed by either a heat-sensitive glass bulb or a two-part metal link held together with fusible alloy. The glass bulb or link hold in place a &quot;pip cap&quot; which acts as a plug to prevent water from flowing, unless the ambient temperature around the sprinkler reaches the design activation temperature of the individual sprinkler head. In a standard wet-pipe sprinkler system, each sprinkler activates independently when the predetermined heat level is reached. Thus, only the sprinklers sufficiently heated from the fire will operate. This maximizes water pressure over the point of fire origin, and minimizes water damage to the building.

A sprinkler activation will usually do less water damage than a fire department hose stream (which provide approximately 900 litres/min (250 US gallons/min). A typical sprinkler used for industrial manufacturing occupancies discharges about 75–150 litres/min (20–40 US gallons/min). However, a typical Early Suppression Fast Response (ESFR) sprinkler at a pressure of will discharge approximately . 

In addition, a sprinkler will usually activate within one to four minutes of the fire&#x27;s start, whereas it typically takes at least five minutes for a fire department to register an alarm and drive to the fire site, and an additional ten minutes to set up equipment and apply hose streams to the fire. This additional time can result in a much larger fire, requiring much more water to extinguish.

==Types==
===Wet pipe===
By a wide margin, wet pipe sprinkler systems are installed more often than all other types of fire sprinkler systems. They also are the most reliable, because they are simple, with the only operating components being the automatic sprinklers and (commonly, but not always) the automatic alarm check valve. An automatic water supply provides water under pressure to the system piping.

Wet systems have optionally been charged with an antifreeze chemical, for use where pipes cannot reliably be kept above .

While such systems were once common in cold areas, after several fires which were not controlled because of sprinkler systems filled with too high a percentage of antifreeze, the regulatory authority in the United States effectively banned new antifreeze installations. A sunset date of 2022 applies to older antifreeze systems in the US. This regulatory action has greatly increased costs and reduced options for cold weather tolerant sprinkler systems.

===Dry pipe===

Dry pipe systems are the second most common sprinkler system type. Dry pipe systems are installed in spaces in which the ambient temperature may be cold enough to freeze the water in a wet pipe system, which would make the system inoperable. Dry pipe systems are most often used in unheated buildings, in parking garages, in outside canopies attached to heated buildings (within which a wet pipe system would also be provided), or in refrigerated coolers. In regions using NFPA regulations, wet pipe systems cannot be installed unless the range of ambient temperatures remains above .

Water is not present in the piping until the system operates; instead, the piping is filled with dry air at a pressure below the water supply pressure. To prevent the larger water supply pressure from prematurely forcing water into the piping, the design of the dry pipe valve (a specialized type of check valve) results in a greater force on top of the check valve clapper by the use of a larger valve clapper area exposed to the piping air pressure, as compared to the higher water pressure but smaller clapper surface area.

When one or more of the automatic sprinkler heads is triggered, it opens, allowing the air in the piping to vent from that sprinkler. Each sprinkler operates independently, as its temperature rises above its triggering threshold. As the air pressure in the piping drops, the pressure differential across the dry pipe valve changes, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flow from sprinklers, needed to control the fire, is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers. In regions using NFPA 13 regulations, the time it takes water to reach the hydraulically remote sprinkler from the time that sprinkler is activated is limited to a maximum of 60 seconds. In industry practice, this is known as the &quot;Maximum Time of Water Delivery&quot;. The maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced, depending on the hazard classification of the area protected by the sprinkler system.

Disadvantages of using dry pipe fire sprinkler systems include:
* Increased complexity: Dry pipe systems require additional control equipment and air pressure supply components, which increases system complexity. This puts a premium on proper maintenance, as this increase in system complexity results in an inherently less-reliable overall system (i.e. more single failure points) as compared to a wet pipe system.
* Higher installation and maintenance costs: The added complexity impacts the overall dry-pipe installation cost, and increases maintenance expenditure including more frequent internal pipe inspections.
* Increased fire response time: Because the piping is empty at the time the sprinkler operates, there is an inherent time delay in delivering water to the sprinklers which have operated while the water travels from the riser to the sprinkler, partially filling the piping in the process. A maximum of 60 seconds is normally allowed by regulatory requirements from the time a single sprinkler opens until water is discharged onto the fire. This delay in fire suppression results in a larger fire prior to control, increasing property damage.

* Increased corrosion potential: Following operation or testing, dry-pipe sprinkler system piping should be drained, but residual water collects in piping low spots, and moisture is also retained in the atmosphere within the piping. This moisture, coupled with the oxygen available in the compressed air in the piping, increases internal pipe corrosion, eventually leading to pin-hole leaks or other piping failures. The internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems (in which the piping is constantly full of water) is much lower, as the amount of oxygen available for the corrosion process is more limited. Corrosion can be combated by using galvanized, copper, or stainless steel pipe which are less susceptible to corrosion, or by using dry nitrogen gas to pressurize the system, rather than air. Nitrogen generators can be used as a permanent source of nitrogen gas, which is beneficial because dry pipe sprinkler systems require an uninterrupted supply of supervisory gas. These additional precautions can increase the up-front cost of the system, but will help prevent system failure, increased maintenance costs, and premature need for system replacement in the future.

===Deluge===
&quot;Deluge&quot; systems are systems in which all sprinklers connected to the water piping system are open, in that the heat sensing operating element is removed. These systems are used for special hazards where rapid fire spread is a concern, as they provide a simultaneous application of water over the entire hazard. 

Water is not present in the piping until the system operates. Because the sprinkler orifices are open, the piping is at atmospheric pressure. To prevent the water supply pressure from forcing water into the piping, a &quot;deluge valve&quot; (a mechanically latched valve) is used in the water supply connection. It is a non-resetting valve, and stays open once tripped.

Because the heat sensing elements normally present in automatic sprinklers have been removed (resulting in open sprinkler heads), the deluge valve is opened via a signal from the fire alarm system which utilizes fire detectors. The type of fire alarm initiating device is selected mainly based on the hazard (e.g. pilot sprinklers, smoke detectors, heat detectors, or optical flame detectors). The initiation device signals the fire alarm panel, which in turn signals the deluge valve to open. Activation can also be via an electric or pneumatic fire alarm pull station which signals the fire alarm panel to signal the deluge valve to open.

===Pre-action===
Pre-action sprinkler systems are specialized for use in locations where accidental activation is especially undesirable, such as in museums with rare art works, manuscripts, or books; and data centers, for protection of computer equipment from accidental water discharge.

There are two main sub-types of pre-action systems: single interlock, and double interlock.

The operation of single interlock systems are similar to wet systems except that these systems require that a &quot;preceding&quot; fire detection event, typically the activation of a heat or smoke detector takes place prior to the &quot;action&quot; of water introduction into the system&#x27;s piping by opening the pre-action valve which is a mechanically latched valve (i.e. similar to a deluge valve). In this way, the system is essentially converted from a dry system into a wet system. The intent is to reduce the undesirable time delay of water delivery to sprinklers that is inherent in dry systems. Prior to fire detection, if the sprinkler operates, or the piping system develops a leak, loss of air pressure in the piping will activate a trouble alarm. In this case, the pre-action valve will not open due to loss of supervisory pressure, and water will not enter the piping.

Double interlock systems require that both activation of a heat or smoke detector, and an automatic sprinkler operation take place prior to the &quot;action&quot; of water introduction into the system&#x27;s piping. Activation of either the fire detectors alone, or sprinklers alone, without the concurrent operation of the other will not allow water to enter the piping. Because water does not enter the piping until a sprinkler operates, double interlock systems are considered as dry systems in terms of water delivery times, and similarly require a larger design area.

===Foam water===
A foam water fire sprinkler system is a special application system, discharging a mixture of water and low expansion foam concentrate, resulting in a foam spray from the sprinkler. These systems are usually used with special hazards occupancies associated with high challenge fires, such as flammable liquids, such as in aircraft hangars.

===Water spray===
&quot;Water spray&quot; systems are operationally identical to a deluge system, but the piping and discharge nozzle spray patterns are designed to protect a uniquely configured hazard, usually being three-dimensional components or equipment (i.e. as opposed to a deluge system, which is designed to cover the horizontal floor area of a room). The nozzles used may not be listed fire sprinklers, and are usually selected for a specific spray pattern to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the hazard (e.g. typical spray patterns being oval, fan, full circle, narrow jet). Examples of hazards protected by water spray systems are electrical transformers containing oil for cooling or turbo-generator bearings. Water spray systems can also be used externally on the surfaces of tanks containing flammable liquids or gases (such as hydrogen). Here the water spray is intended to cool the tank and its contents to prevent tank rupture/explosion (BLEVE) and fire spread.

===Water mist===
Water mist systems are used for special hazards applications. This type of system is typically used where water damage may be a concern, or where water supplies are limited. NFPA 750 defines water mist as a water spray with a droplet size of &quot;less than 1000 microns at the minimum operation pressure of the discharge nozzle&quot;. The droplet size can be controlled by adjusting the discharge pressure through a nozzle of a fixed orifice size. The fire suppression mechanisms provided by water mist systems include cooling, local flame oxygen reduction, and radiation blocking. 

In operation, water mist systems can operate with the same functionality as deluge, wet pipe, dry pipe, or pre-action systems. Systems can be applied using local application method or total flooding method, similar to Clean Agent Fire Protection Systems.

== Valves ==
Major control and isolation valves in traditional fire sprinkler systems are typically large gate valves of the &quot;Outside Screw and Yoke&quot; (OS&amp;Y) type, sometimes called &quot;rising stem&quot; valves; or butterfly valves. The position (open or closed) of these valves can be determined visually. Alarm sensors may be attached to monitor the settings of these valves, which are critical to overall building safety. 

==Design==

Sprinkler systems are intended to either &quot;control&quot; the fire or to &quot;suppress&quot; the fire. &quot;Control mode&quot; sprinklers are intended to control the heat release rate of the fire to prevent building structure collapse, and pre-wet the surrounding combustibles to prevent fire spread. The fire is not extinguished until the burning combustibles are exhausted or manual extinguishment is effected by firefighters. &quot;Suppression mode&quot; sprinklers, also known as &quot;Early Suppression Fast Response&quot; (ESFR) sprinklers, are intended to result in a severe sudden reduction of the heat release rate of the fire, prior to manual intervention.

Control mode sprinkler systems are designed using an area and density approach. The building use and contents are analyzed to determine the level of fire hazard. The hazard is classified as light hazard, ordinary hazard group 1, ordinary hazard group 2, extra hazard group 1, or extra hazard group 2. After determining the hazard classification, a design area and density can be determined by referencing tables in the 13 National Fire Protection Association standard. The design area represents the maximum area in which sprinklers are expected to operate before fire control is achieved. The design density is a measurement of how much water per square foot of floor area should be applied to the design area.

For example, in an office building classified as light hazard, a typical design area would be and the design density would be per or a minimum of applied over the design area. Another example would be a manufacturing facility classified as ordinary hazard group 2 where a typical design area would be and the design density would be per or a minimum of applied over the design area.

After the design area and density have been determined, calculations are performed to prove that the system can deliver the required amount of water over the required design area. These calculations account for all of the water pressure that is lost or gained between the water supply source and the sprinklers that would operate in the design area. This includes pressure losses due to friction inside the piping and losses or gains due to elevational differences between the source and the discharging sprinklers. Sometimes momentum pressure from water velocity inside the piping is also calculated. Typically these calculations are performed using computer software, but before the advent of computer systems these sometimes complicated calculations were performed by hand. This skill of calculating sprinkler systems by hand is still required training for a sprinkler system design technologist who seeks senior level certification from engineering certification organizations such as the National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies (NICET).
Sprinkler systems in residential structures are becoming more common, as the cost of such systems becomes more practical and the benefits become more obvious. Residential sprinkler systems usually fall under a residential classification separate from the commercial classifications mentioned above. A commercial sprinkler system is designed primarily for property protection. Residential sprinkler systems are designed to control a fire for a sufficient time to allow for the safe escape of the building occupants. While these systems will often also protect the structure from major fire damage, this is a secondary consideration. In residential structures, sprinklers are often omitted from closets, bathrooms, balconies, garages and attics because a fire in these areas would not usually impact the occupant&#x27;s escape route.

==Costs and effectiveness==
In 2008, the installed costs of sprinkler systems ranged from US$0.31 – $3.66 per square foot, depending on type and location. Residential systems, installed at the time of initial home construction and utilizing municipal water supplies, average about US$0.35/square foot. 

Systems can be installed during initial construction, or retrofitted. Some communities have laws requiring residential sprinkler systems, especially where large municipal hydrant water supplies (&quot;fire flows&quot;) are not available. Nationwide in the United States, one and two-family homes generally do not require fire sprinkler systems, although the overwhelming loss of life due to fires occurs in these spaces. Residential sprinkler systems are inexpensive (about the same per square foot as carpeting or floor tiling), but require larger water supply piping than is normally installed in homes, so retrofitting is usually cost prohibitive.

According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), fires in hotels with sprinklers averaged 78% less damage than fires in hotels without them (1983–1987). The NFPA says the average loss per fire in buildings with sprinklers was $2,300, compared to an average loss of $10,300 in unsprinklered buildings. However, in a purely economic comparison, this is not a complete picture; the total costs of fitting, and the costs arising from non-fire triggered release must be factored.

The NFPA states that it &quot;has no record of a fire killing more than two people in a completely sprinklered building where a sprinkler system was properly operating, except in an explosion or flash fire or where industrial fire brigade members or employees were killed during fire suppression operations.&quot; Elsewhere it has stated, &quot;NFPA has no record of a multiple fatality in a fully sprinklered building where the system operated.&quot;

<text>Harry Haag James (March 15, 1916 – July 5, 1983) was an American musician who is best known as a trumpet-playing band leader who led a big band to great commercial success from 1939 to 1946. He broke up his band for a short period in 1947, but shortly after he reorganized and was active again with his band from then until his death in 1983. He was especially known among musicians for his technical proficiency as well as his tone, and was influential on new trumpet players from the late 1930s into the 1940s. He was also an actor in a number of films that usually featured his band.

==Early life==

James was born in Albany, Georgia, United States, the son of Everett Robert James, a bandleader in a traveling circus, the Mighty Haag Circus, and Myrtle Maybelle (Stewart), an acrobat and horseback rider. He started performing with the circus at an early age, first as a contortionist at the age of four, then playing the snare drum in the band from about the age of six. It was at this age that James was almost trampled by the circus trick horses after he wandered onto the circus track as they were performing their stunts, but he was protected by his mother&#x27;s pet horse, who stood over him until the other horses rushed by.

James started taking trumpet lessons from his father at age eight, and by age twelve he was leading the second band in the Christy Brothers Circus, for which his family was then working. James&#x27;s father placed him on a strict daily practice schedule. At each session he was given several pages to learn from the Arban&#x27;s book and was not allowed to pursue any other pastime until he had learned them. In 1924, his family settled in Beaumont, Texas. It was here in the early 1930s that James began playing in local dance bands when he was 15 years of age. While still a student at Dick Dowling Junior High School, he participated as a regular member of Beaumont High School&#x27;s Royal Purple Band, and in May 1931 he took first place as trumpet soloist at the Texas Band Teacher&#x27;s Association&#x27;s Annual Eastern Division contest held in Temple, Texas.

==Career==
James’s first job was playing at the Peabody Hotel in Memphis and he played regularly with Herman Waldman&#x27;s band, and at one performance was noticed by nationally popular Ben Pollack. In 1935 he joined Pollack&#x27;s band, but left at the start of 1937 to join Benny Goodman&#x27;s orchestra, where he stayed through 1938. He was nicknamed &quot;The Hawk&quot; early in his career for his ability to sight-read. A common joke was that if a fly landed on his written music, Harry James would play it. His low range had a warmth associated with the cornet and even the flugelhorn, but this sound was underrecorded in favor of James&#x27; brilliant high register.

With financial backing from Goodman, James debuted his own big band in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in January 1939, but it didn&#x27;t click until adding a string section in 1941. Subsequently, known as Harry James and His Music Makers, it produced the hit &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot;, which peaked at no. 5 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; National Best Selling Retail Records chart for the week ending November 18, 1941. During its 18-week chart run, the single spent ten non-consecutive weeks in the Top Ten, from early November 1941 until late January 1942. He and his band appeared in four Hollywood films: &quot;Private Buckaroo&quot; and &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot; (both 1942), &quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot; (1944), and &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot; (1943). James toured with the band into the 1980s, and as of July 2018 the Harry James Orchestra, led by Fred Radke, was still very much in business.

===Bandleader===
James&#x27; band was the first high-profile orchestra to feature vocalist Frank Sinatra, who signed a one-year, $75 a week contract with it in 1939 ($1,589 a week in 2022). James wanted to change Sinatra&#x27;s name to &#x27;Frankie Satin&#x27;, but the singer refused. Sinatra only worked seven months before leaving to join Tommy Dorsey&#x27;s outfit. The James band&#x27;s featured female vocalist was Helen Forrest, and his later band included drummer Buddy Rich and bassist Thurman Teague. Johnny MacAfee was featured on the sax and vocals, and Corky Corcoran was a youthful sax prodigy.

====Radio====
James&#x27; orchestra succeeded Glenn Miller&#x27;s on a program sponsored by Chesterfield Cigarettes in 1942, when Miller disbanded his orchestra to enter the Army. In 1945, James and his orchestra had a summer replacement program for Danny Kaye&#x27;s program on CBS. He also led the orchestra for &quot;Call for Music&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS February 13, 1948 – April 16, 1948, and on NBC April 20, 1948 – June 29, 1948.

====Film====
James recorded many popular records and appeared in many Hollywood movies. He featured in the 1942 musical short &quot;Trumpet Serenade&quot;. He played trumpet in the 1950 film &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot;, dubbing Kirk Douglas. The album from the movie charted at #1, with James backing big band singer and actress Doris Day. James&#x27;s recording of &quot;I&#x27;m Beginning to See the Light&quot; appears in the motion picture &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; (2000). His music is also featured in the Woody Allen film &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;. James&#x27;s recording of &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Long, Long Time&quot; is featured in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; and in Marvel&#x27;s &quot;.&quot;

== Musical style and reception==
=== Influences ===
With James&#x27;s childhood spent as a musician in a traveling circus, he picked up a flamboyant style that utilized such techniques as heavy vibrato, half valve and lip glissandi, valve and lip trills, and valve tremolos. These techniques were popular at the time in what was known as &quot;hot&quot; jazz, epitomized by James&#x27;s idol Louis Armstrong, but somewhat fell out of favor by the 1950s with the advent of &quot;cool&quot; jazz. James&#x27;s rigorous regime of practice as a child resulted in an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range, fingering and tonguing. Growing up in the South, James was also exposed to blues music, which had an additional influence on his style. As James explained, &quot;I was brought up in Texas with the blues – when I was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call &#x27;barbecue row&#x27; I used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their guitars, playing the blues; that&#x27;s all we knew.&quot; After hearing James solo on several numbers at a Benny Goodman one-nighter, Armstrong enthused to his friend and Goodman vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, &quot;That white boy – he plays like a jig!&quot;

=== Move towards pop ===
After James left Benny Goodman&#x27;s band in 1939 to form his own band, he soon found that leading a commercially viable musical group required a broader set of skills than those needed to be a gifted musician playing in someone else&#x27;s band. The James band ran into financial trouble, and it became increasingly difficult for James to pay salaries and keep the band together. In 1940, James lost his contract with Columbia Records (he returned in 1941), and Frank Sinatra left the band that January. It was not long after this that James made a pivotal decision: he would adopt a &quot;sweeter&quot; style that added strings to the band, and the band would deliver tunes that were in more of a &quot;pop&quot; vein and less true to its jazz roots. From a commercial standpoint, the decision paid off as James soon enjoyed a string of chart-topping hits that provided commercial success for him and his band. Indeed, a U.S. Treasury report released in 1945 listed Harry James and Betty Grable as the highest-paid couple in the nation.

While James remained commercially successful and personally committed to his music, some critics sought to find fault. In Peter Levinson&#x27;s 1999 biography, Dan Morgenstern, the respected critic and Director of the Institute of Jazz Studies, called the 1941 release of the later Grammy Hall of Fame inducted &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot; &quot;the record that the jazz critics never forgave Harry James for recording.&quot; With James continuing to employ his flamboyant style on pop hits through the 1940s, his playing was often labeled as &quot;schmaltzy&quot; and dismissed by the critics, although radio discs from this period reveal James&#x27;s continued commitment to jazz. James&#x27;s jazz releases during this period, while not as numerous, include a variety of modern arrangements from Neal Hefti, Frank Devenport, Johnny Richards and Jimmy Mundy that often inspired his musicians, and as bop surpassed swing by the late 1940s, James was surprisingly open to its influence.

=== Return to Big Band jazz===

After coasting through the mid-1950s, James made a complete reevaluation of where he was heading in his musical career. Count Basie provided the impetus by making a significant comeback with his newly formed &quot;16 Men Swinging&quot; band, and James wanted a band with a decided Basie flavor. James signed with Capitol Records in 1955, and two years later, after releasing new studio versions of many of his previously released songs from Columbia Records, James recorded ten new tracks for an album entitled &quot;Wild About Harry!&quot;. This album was the first in a series released on Capitol, and continuing later on MGM, representative of the Basie style that James adopted during this period, with some of the arrangements provided by former Basie saxophonist and arranger Ernie Wilkins, whom James hired for his own band.

While James never completely regained favor with jazz critics during his lifetime in spite of his return to more jazz-oriented releases in the late 1950s and into the 1960s, contemporary opinion of his work has shifted. Recent reissues such as Capitol&#x27;s 2012 7-disc set &quot;The Capitol Vaults Jazz Series: Gene Krupa and Harry James&quot; have prompted new, more favorable analyses. In 2014, Marc Myers of JazzWax commented, &quot;[James&#x27;s] band of the mid-1940s was more modern than most of the majors, and in 1949 he led one of the finest bands of the year.&quot; And on James&#x27;s releases from 1958 to 1961, Myers noted, &quot;The James band during this period has been eclipsed by bands led by Basie, Maynard Ferguson and Stan Kenton. While each served up its own brand of magnificence, James produced more consistently brilliant tracks than the others... virtually everything James recorded during this period was an uncompromising, swinging gem.&quot;

James felt strongly about the music he both played and recorded. In 1972 while in London, he did an interview with the English jazz critic Steve Voce, who asked if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded. James visibly bristled, replying &quot;That would depend on for whom you are playing. If you&#x27;re playing for a jazz audience, I&#x27;m pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than &#x27;Sleepy Lagoon,&#x27; and if we&#x27;re playing at a country club or playing Vegas, in which we have many, many types of people, then I&#x27;m sure that &#x27;Sleepy Lagoon&#x27; would be more popular at that particular time. But I really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes, because to me, if you&#x27;re gonna be commercial, you&#x27;re gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve ever recorded or played one tune that I didn&#x27;t particularly love to play. Otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t play it.&quot;

==Personal life==
James was married three times, first to singer Louise Tobin on May 4, 1935, with whom he had two sons, Harry Jeffrey James and Timothy Ray James. They divorced in 1943. Later that year he married actress Betty Grable. They had two daughters, Victoria Elizabeth and Jessica, before divorcing in 1965. In December 1967 James wed Las Vegas showgirl Joan Boyd. The couple had a son, Michael, before divorcing in 1970.

James owned several Thoroughbred racehorses that won races such as the California Breeders&#x27; Champion Stakes (1951) and the San Vicente Stakes (1954). He was also a founding investor in the Atlantic City Race Course. His knowledge of horse racing was demonstrated during a 1958 appearance on &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; entitled &quot;Lucy Wins A Racehorse&quot;.

James was a heavy smoker, drinker, and gambler. In 1983 he was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer, but continued to work. He played his last professional job, with the Harry James Orchestra, on June 26, 1983, in Los Angeles, dying just nine days later in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 5, 1983, at age 67. Frank Sinatra gave the eulogy at his funeral, held in Las Vegas.

==Awards==

===Grammy Hall of Fame===
As of 2016, two recordings of Harry James had been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old, and that have &quot;qualitative or historical significance.&quot;

===Readers&#x27; polls===
Metronome magazine conducted annual readers&#x27; polls ranking the top jazz musician on each instrument. The winners were invited to join an ensemble known as the Metronome All-Stars that was assembled for studio recordings. The studio sessions were held in the years 1939–42, 1946–53, and 1956, and typically resulted in two tracks which allowed each participant a one chorus solo. Harry James was chosen to play trumpet with the Metronome All-Stars in 1939, 1940 and 1941.

A similar annual readers&#x27; poll conducted by Downbeat magazine selected James as the best trumpet instrumentalist for the years 1937, 1938 and 1939, and as favorite soloist for 1942.

===Honors and inductions===
For his contribution to the motion picture industry James was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6683 Hollywood Boulevard on February 8, 1960.

He was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1983.

<text>The development of the nervous system, or neural development (neurodevelopment), refers to the processes that generate, shape, and reshape the nervous system of animals, from the earliest stages of embryonic development to adulthood. The field of neural development draws on both neuroscience and developmental biology to describe and provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex nervous systems develop, from nematodes and fruit flies to mammals.

Defects in neural development can lead to malformations such as holoprosencephaly, and a wide variety of neurological disorders including limb paresis and paralysis, balance and vision disorders, and seizures, and in humans other disorders such as Rett syndrome, Down syndrome and intellectual disability.

== Vertebrate brain development ==
The vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) is derived from the ectoderm—the outermost germ layer of the embryo. A part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm – neuroectoderm that forms the neural plate along the dorsal side of the embryo. This is a part of the early patterning of the embryo (including the invertebrate embryo) that also establishes an anterior-posterior axis. The neural plate is the source of the majority of neurons and glial cells of the CNS. The neural groove forms along the long axis of the neural plate, and the neural plate folds to give rise to the neural tube. This process is known as neurulation. When the tube is closed at both ends it is filled with embryonic cerebrospinal fluid. As the embryo develops, the anterior part of the neural tube expands and forms three primary brain vesicles, which become the forebrain (prosencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon), and hindbrain (rhombencephalon). These simple, early vesicles enlarge and further divide into the telencephalon (future cerebral cortex and basal ganglia), diencephalon (future thalamus and hypothalamus), mesencephalon (future colliculi), metencephalon (future pons and cerebellum), and myelencephalon (future medulla). The CSF-filled central chamber is continuous from the telencephalon to the central canal of the spinal cord, and constitutes the developing ventricular system of the CNS. Embryonic cerebrospinal fluid differs from that formed in later developmental stages, and from adult CSF; it influences the behavior of neural precursors. Because the neural tube gives rise to the brain and spinal cord any mutations at this stage in development can lead to fatal deformities like anencephaly or lifelong disabilities like spina bifida. During this time, the walls of the neural tube contain neural stem cells, which drive brain growth as they divide many times. Gradually some of the cells stop dividing and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, which are the main cellular components of the CNS. The newly generated neurons migrate to different parts of the developing brain to self-organize into different brain structures. Once the neurons have reached their regional positions, they extend axons and dendrites, which allow them to communicate with other neurons via synapses. Synaptic communication between neurons leads to the establishment of functional neural circuits that mediate sensory and motor processing, and underlie behavior.

== Induction ==
During early embryonic development of the vertebrate, the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to give rise to the epidermis and the nervous system; a part of the dorsal ectoderm becomes specified to neural ectoderm to form the neural plate which gives rise to the nervous system. The conversion of undifferentiated ectoderm to neuroectoderm requires signals from the mesoderm. At the onset of gastrulation presumptive mesodermal cells move through the dorsal blastopore lip and form a layer of mesoderm in between the endoderm and the ectoderm. Mesodermal cells migrate along the dorsal midline to give rise to the notochord that develops into the vertebral column. Neuroectoderm overlying the notochord develops into the neural plate in response to a diffusible signal produced by the notochord. The remainder of the ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis. The ability of the mesoderm to convert the overlying ectoderm into neural tissue is called neural induction.

In the early embryo, the neural plate folds outwards to form the neural groove. Beginning in the future neck region, the neural folds of this groove close to create the neural tube. The formation of the neural tube from the ectoderm is called neurulation. The ventral part of the neural tube is called the basal plate; the dorsal part is called the alar plate. The hollow interior is called the neural canal, and the open ends of the neural tube, called the neuropores, close off.

A transplanted blastopore lip can convert ectoderm into neural tissue and is said to have an inductive effect. Neural inducers are molecules that can induce the expression of neural genes in ectoderm explants without inducing mesodermal genes as well. Neural induction is often studied in &quot;Xenopus&quot; embryos since they have a simple body plan and there are good markers to distinguish between neural and non-neural tissue. Examples of neural inducers are the molecules noggin and chordin.

When embryonic ectodermal cells are cultured at low density in the absence of mesodermal cells they undergo neural differentiation (express neural genes), suggesting that neural differentiation is the default fate of ectodermal cells. In explant cultures (which allow direct cell-cell interactions) the same cells differentiate into epidermis. This is due to the action of BMP4 (a TGF-β family protein) that induces ectodermal cultures to differentiate into epidermis. During neural induction, noggin and chordin are produced by the dorsal mesoderm (notochord) and diffuse into the overlying ectoderm to inhibit the activity of BMP4. This inhibition of BMP4 causes the cells to differentiate into neural cells. Inhibition of TGF-β and BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling can efficiently induce neural tissue from pluripotent stem cells.

== Regionalization ==
In a later stage of development the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain—the mesencephalon, at the mesencephalic flexure or cephalic flexure. Above the mesencephalon is the prosencephalon (future forebrain) and beneath it is the rhombencephalon (future hindbrain).

The alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the telencephalon which gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres, whilst its basal plate becomes the diencephalon. The optical vesicle (which eventually become the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon.

== Patterning ==
In chordates, dorsal ectoderm forms all neural tissue and the nervous system. Patterning occurs due to specific environmental conditions - different concentrations of signaling molecules

=== Dorsoventral axis ===
The ventral half of the neural plate is controlled by the notochord, which acts as the &#x27;organiser&#x27;. The dorsal half is controlled by the ectoderm plate, which flanks either side of the neural plate.

Ectoderm follows a default pathway to become neural tissue. Evidence for this comes from single, cultured cells of ectoderm, which go on to form neural tissue. This is postulated to be because of a lack of BMPs, which are blocked by the organiser. The organiser may produce molecules such as follistatin, noggin and chordin that inhibit BMPs.

The ventral neural tube is patterned by sonic hedgehog (Shh) from the notochord, which acts as the inducing tissue. Notochord-derived Shh signals to the floor plate, and induces Shh expression in the floor plate. Floor plate-derived Shh subsequently signals to other cells in the neural tube, and is essential for proper specification of ventral neuron progenitor domains. Loss of Shh from the notochord and/or floor plate prevents proper specification of these progenitor domains. Shh binds Patched1, relieving Patched-mediated inhibition of Smoothened, leading to activation of the Gli family of transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3).

In this context Shh acts as a morphogen - it induces cell differentiation dependent on its concentration. At low concentrations it forms ventral interneurons, at higher concentrations it induces motor neuron development, and at highest concentrations it induces floor plate differentiation. Failure of Shh-modulated differentiation causes holoprosencephaly.

The dorsal neural tube is patterned by BMPs from the epidermal ectoderm flanking the neural plate. These induce sensory interneurons by activating Sr/Thr kinases and altering SMAD transcription factor levels.

=== Rostrocaudal (Anteroposterior) axis ===
Signals that control anteroposterior neural development include FGF and retinoic acid, which act in the hindbrain and spinal cord. The hindbrain, for example, is patterned by Hox genes, which are expressed in overlapping domains along the anteroposterior axis under the control of retinoic acid. The 3 (3 prime end) genes in the Hox cluster are induced by retinoic acid in the hindbrain, whereas the 5 (5 prime end) Hox genes are not induced by retinoic acid and are expressed more posteriorly in the spinal cord. Hoxb-1 is expressed in rhombomere 4 and gives rise to the facial nerve. Without this Hoxb-1 expression, a nerve similar to the trigeminal nerve arises.

== Neurogenesis ==
Neurogenesis is the process by which neurons are generated from neural stem cells and progenitor cells. Neurons are &#x27;post-mitotic&#x27;, meaning that they will never divide again for the lifetime of the organism.

Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine demethylation. DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several sequential steps by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions (e.g. 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway.

== Neuronal migration == 

Neuronal migration is the method by which neurons travel from their origin or birthplace to their final position in the brain. There are several ways they can do this, e.g. by radial migration or tangential migration. Sequences of radial migration (also known as glial guidance) and somal translocation have been captured by time-lapse microscopy.

=== Radial ===
Neuronal precursor cells proliferate in the ventricular zone of the developing neocortex, where the principal neural stem cell is the radial glial cell. The first postmitotic cells must leave the stem cell niche and migrate outward to form the preplate, which is destined to become Cajal–Retzius cells and subplate neurons. These cells do so by somal translocation. Neurons migrating with this mode of locomotion are bipolar and attach the leading edge of the process to the pia. The soma is then transported to the pial surface by nucleokinesis, a process by which a microtubule &quot;cage&quot; around the nucleus elongates and contracts in association with the centrosome to guide the nucleus to its final destination.

Radial glial cells, whose fibers serve as a scaffolding for migrating cells and a means of radial communication mediated by calcium dynamic activity, act as the main excitatory neuronal stem cell of the cerebral cortex or translocate to the cortical plate and differentiate either into astrocytes or neurons. Somal translocation can occur at any time during development.

Subsequent waves of neurons split the preplate by migrating along radial glial fibres to form the cortical plate. Each wave of migrating cells travel past their predecessors forming layers in an inside-out manner, meaning that the youngest neurons are the closest to the surface. It is estimated that glial guided migration represents 90% of migrating neurons in human and about 75% in rodents.

=== Tangential ===
Most interneurons migrate tangentially through multiple modes of migration to reach their appropriate location in the cortex. An example of tangential migration is the movement of interneurons from the ganglionic eminence to the cerebral cortex. One example of ongoing tangential migration in a mature organism, observed in some animals, is the rostral migratory stream connecting subventricular zone and olfactory bulb.

=== Axophilic ===
Many neurons migrating along the anterior-posterior axis of the body use existing axon tracts to migrate along; this is called axophilic migration. An example of this mode of migration is in GnRH-expressing neurons, which make a long journey from their birthplace in the nose, through the forebrain, and into the hypothalamus. Many of the mechanisms of this migration have been worked out, starting with the extracellular guidance cues that trigger intracellular signaling. These intracellular signals, such as calcium signaling, lead to actin and microtubule cytoskeletal dynamics, which produce cellular forces that interact with the extracellular environment through cell adhesion proteins to cause the movement of these cells.

=== Multipolar ===
There is also a method of neuronal migration called multipolar migration. This is seen in multipolar cells, which in the human, are abundantly present in the cortical intermediate zone. They do not resemble the cells migrating by locomotion or somal translocation. Instead these multipolar cells express neuronal markers and extend multiple thin processes in various directions independently of the radial glial fibers.

== Neurotrophic factors ==
The survival of neurons is regulated by survival factors, called trophic factors. The neurotrophic hypothesis was formulated by Victor Hamburger and Rita Levi Montalcini based on studies of the developing nervous system. Victor Hamburger discovered that implanting an extra limb in the developing chick led to an increase in the number of spinal motor neurons. Initially he thought that the extra limb was inducing proliferation of motor neurons, but he and his colleagues later showed that there was a great deal of motor neuron death during normal development, and the extra limb prevented this cell death. According to the neurotrophic hypothesis, growing axons compete for limiting amounts of target-derived trophic factors and axons that fail to receive sufficient trophic support die by apoptosis. It is now clear that factors produced by a number of sources contribute to neuronal survival.
* Nerve Growth Factor (NGF): Rita Levi Montalcini and Stanley Cohen purified the first trophic factor, Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), for which they received the Nobel Prize. There are three NGF-related trophic factors: BDNF, NT3, and NT4, which regulate survival of various neuronal populations. The Trk proteins act as receptors for NGF and related factors. Trk is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Trk dimerization and phosphorylation leads to activation of various intracellular signaling pathways including the MAP kinase, Akt, and PKC pathways.
* CNTF: Ciliary neurotrophic factor is another protein that acts as a survival factor for motor neurons. CNTF acts via a receptor complex that includes CNTFRα, GP130, and LIFRβ. Activation of the receptor leads to phosphorylation and recruitment of the JAK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates LIFRβ. LIFRβ acts as a docking site for the STAT transcription factors. JAK kinase phosphorylates STAT proteins, which dissociate from the receptor and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
* GDNF: Glial derived neurotrophic factor is a member of the TGFb family of proteins, and is a potent trophic factor for striatal neurons. The functional receptor is a heterodimer, composed of type 1 and type 2 receptors. Activation of the type 1 receptor leads to phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which translocate to the nucleus to activate gene expression.

== Synapse formation ==

=== Neuromuscular junction ===

Much of our understanding of synapse formation comes from studies at the neuromuscular junction. The transmitter at this synapse is acetylcholine. The acetylcholine receptor (AchR) is present at the surface of muscle cells before synapse formation. The arrival of the nerve induces clustering of the receptors at the synapse. McMahan and Sanes showed that the synaptogenic signal is concentrated at the basal lamina. They also showed that the synaptogenic signal is produced by the nerve, and they identified the factor as Agrin. Agrin induces clustering of AchRs on the muscle surface and synapse formation is disrupted in agrin knockout mice. Agrin transduces the signal via MuSK receptor to rapsyn. Fischbach and colleagues showed that receptor subunits are selectively transcribed from nuclei next to the synaptic site. This is mediated by neuregulins.

In the mature synapse each muscle fiber is innervated by one motor neuron. However, during development, many of the fibers are innervated by multiple axons. Lichtman and colleagues have studied the process of synapses elimination. This is an activity-dependent event. Partial blockage of the receptor leads to retraction of corresponding presynaptic terminals. Later they used a connectomic approach, i.e., tracing out all the connections between motor neurons and muscle fibers, to characterize developmental synapse elimination on the level of a full circuit. Analysis confirmed the massive rewiring, 10-fold decrease in the number of synapses, that takes place as axons prune their motor units but add more synaptic areas at the NMJs with which they remain in contact.

===CNS synapses===
Agrin appears not to be a central mediator of CNS synapse formation and there is active interest in identifying signals that mediate CNS synaptogenesis. Neurons in culture develop synapses that are similar to those that form in vivo, suggesting that synaptogenic signals can function properly in vitro. CNS synaptogenesis studies have focused mainly on glutamatergic synapses. Imaging experiments show that dendrites are highly dynamic during development and often initiate contact with axons. This is followed by recruitment of postsynaptic proteins to the site of contact. Stephen Smith and colleagues have shown that contact initiated by dendritic filopodia can develop into synapses.

Induction of synapse formation by glial factors: Barres and colleagues made the observation that factors in glial conditioned media induce synapse formation in retinal ganglion cell cultures. Synapse formation in the CNS is correlated with astrocyte differentiation suggesting that astrocytes might provide a synaptogenic factor. The identity of the astrocytic factors is not yet known.

Neuroligins and SynCAM as synaptogenic signals: Sudhof, Serafini, Scheiffele and colleagues have shown that neuroligins and SynCAM can act as factors that induce presynaptic differentiation. Neuroligins are concentrated at the postsynaptic site and act via neurexins concentrated in the presynaptic axons. SynCAM is a cell adhesion molecule that is present in both pre- and post-synaptic membranes.

=== Assembly of neural circuits ===

The processes of neuronal migration, differentiation and axon guidance are generally believed to be activity-independent mechanisms and rely on hard-wired genetic programs in the neurons themselves. Research findings however have implicated a role for activity-dependent mechanisms in mediating some aspects of these processes such as the rate of neuronal migration, aspects of neuronal differentiation and axon pathfinding. Activity-dependent mechanisms influence neural circuit development and are crucial for laying out early connectivity maps and the continued refinement of synapses which occurs during development. There are two distinct types of neural activity we observe in developing circuits -early spontaneous activity and sensory-evoked activity. Spontaneous activity occurs early during neural circuit development even when sensory input is absent and is observed in many systems such as the developing visual system, auditory system, motor system, hippocampus, cerebellum and neocortex.

Experimental techniques such as direct electrophysiological recording, fluorescence imaging using calcium indicators and optogenetic techniques have shed light on the nature and function of these early bursts of activity. They have distinct spatial and temporal patterns during development and their ablation during development has been known to result in deficits in network refinement in the visual system. In the immature retina, waves of spontaneous action potentials arise from the retinal ganglion cells and sweep across the retinal surface in the first few postnatal weeks. These waves are mediated by neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the initial phase and later on by glutamate. They are thought to instruct the formation of two sensory maps- the retinotopic map and eye-specific segregation. Retinotopic map refinement occurs in downstream visual targets in the brain-the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Pharmacological disruption and mouse models lacking the β2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has shown that the lack of spontaneous activity leads to marked defects in retinotopy and eye-specific segregation.

Recent studies confirm that microglia, the resident immune cell of the brain, establish direct contacts with the cell bodies of developing neurons, and through these connections, regulate neurogenesis, migration, integration and the formation of neuronal networks in an activity-dependent manner.

In the developing auditory system, developing cochlea generate bursts of activity which spreads across the inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons which relay auditory information to the brain. ATP release from supporting cells triggers action potentials in inner hair cells. In the auditory system, spontaneous activity is thought to be involved in tonotopic map formation by segregating cochlear neuron axons tuned to high and low frequencies. In the motor system, periodic bursts of spontaneous activity are driven by excitatory GABA and glutamate during the early stages and by acetylcholine and glutamate at later stages. In the developing zebrafish spinal cord, early spontaneous activity is required for the formation of increasingly synchronous alternating bursts between ipsilateral and contralateral regions of the spinal cord and for the integration of new cells into the circuit. Motor neurons innervating the same twitch muscle fibers are thought to maintain synchronous activity which allows both neurons to remain in contact with the muscle fiber in adulthood. In the cortex, early waves of activity have been observed in the cerebellum and cortical slices. Once sensory stimulus becomes available, final fine-tuning of sensory-coding maps and circuit refinement begins to rely more and more on sensory-evoked activity as demonstrated by classic experiments about the effects of sensory deprivation during critical periods.

Contemporary diffusion-weighted MRI techniques may also uncover the macroscopic process of axonal development. The connectome can be constructed from diffusion MRI data: the vertices of the graph correspond to anatomically labelled gray matter areas, and two such vertices, say &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, are connected by an edge if the tractography phase of the data processing finds an axonal fiber that connects the two areas, corresponding to &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;. Numerous braingraphs, computed from the Human Connectome Project can be downloaded from the http://braingraph.org site. The Consensus Connectome Dynamics (CCD) is a remarkable phenomenon that was discovered by continuously decreasing the minimum confidence-parameter at the graphical interface of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server. The Budapest Reference Connectome Server (http://connectome.pitgroup.org) depicts the cerebral connections of n=418 subjects with a frequency-parameter k: For any k=1,2...,n one can view the graph of the edges that are present in at least k connectomes. If parameter k is decreased one-by-one from k=n through k=1 then more and more edges appear in the graph, since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it resembles a growing, complex structure, like a tree or a shrub (visualized on the animation on the left).
It is hypothesized in that the growing structure copies the axonal development of the human brain: the earliest developing connections (axonal fibers) are common at most of the subjects, and the subsequently developing connections have larger and larger variance, because their variances are accumulated in the process of axonal development.

== Synapse elimination ==

Several motorneurons compete for each neuromuscular junction, but only one survives until adulthood. Competition &quot;in vitro&quot; has been shown to involve a limited neurotrophic substance that is released, or that neural activity infers advantage to strong post-synaptic connections by giving resistance to a toxin also released upon nerve stimulation. &quot;In vivo&quot;, it is suggested that muscle fibres select the strongest neuron through a retrograde signal or that activity-dependent synapse elimination mechanisms determine the identity of the &quot;winning&quot; axon at a motor endplate. 

== Mapping ==
Brain mapping can show how an animal&#x27;s brain changes throughout its lifetime. As of 2021, scientists mapped and compared the whole brains of eight &quot;C. elegans&quot; worms across their development on the neuronal level and the complete wiring of a single mammalian muscle from birth to adulthood. 

==Adult neurogenesis==
Neurogenesis also occurs in specific parts of the adult brain.

<text>Johann August Ernesti (; ; 4 August 1707 – 11 September 1781) was a German Rationalist Lutheran theologian and philologist. Ernesti was the first who formally separated the hermeneutics of the Old Testament from those of the New.

==Biography==
Ernesti was born in Tennstedt, Saxony (in present-day Thuringia), where his father, Johann Christoph Ernesti, was pastor, besides being superintendent of the electoral dioceses of Thuringia, Salz and Sangerhausen. At the age of sixteen, Ernesti was sent to the celebrated Saxon cloister school of Pforta (&quot;Schulpforta&quot;). At twenty he entered the University of Wittenberg, and studied afterwards at the University of Leipzig. In 1730 he was made master in the faculty of philosophy. In the following year he accepted the office of conrector in the Thomas school of Leipzig, of which Johann Matthias Gesner was then rector, an office to which Ernesti succeeded in 1734. He was, in 1742, named professor extraordinarius of ancient literature in the university of Leipzig, and in 1756 professor ordinarius of rhetoric. In the same year he received the degree of doctor of theology, and in 1759 was appointed professor ordinarius in the faculty of theology. Through his learning and his manner of discussion, he co-operated with S. J. Baumgarten of Halle (1706–1757) in disengaging the current dogmatic theology from Lutheran Orthodoxy, along with any Lutheran scholastic or mystical influences, and thus paved a way for a Rationalist revolution in theology. He died in Leipzig, after a short illness, in his seventy-sixth year.

==Work==
Apart from the quality of his own writing, Ernesti is notable for his influence on sacred and profane criticism in Germany. With J. S. Semler he co-operated in the Rationalist revolution of Lutheran theology, and in conjunction with Gesner he instituted a new school in ancient literature. He detected grammatical niceties in Latin, in regard to the consecution of tenses which had escaped preceding critics.

As an editor of the Greek classics, Ernesti does not compare with his Dutch contemporaries, Tiberius Hemsterhuis, L. C. Valckenaer, David Ruhnken or his colleague J. J. Reiske. The higher criticism was not even attempted by Ernesti. But to him and to Gesner is due the credit of having formed, by discipline and by example, philologists greater than themselves, and of having kindled the national enthusiasm for ancient learning.

It is chiefly in hermeneutics that Ernesti has any claim to eminence as a theologian. But here his merits are distinguished, and, at the period when his &quot;Institutio Interpretis Novi Testamenti&quot; (Principles of New Testament Interpretation) was published (1761), almost peculiar to himself. In it we find the principles of a general interpretation, formed without the assistance of any particular philosophy, but consisting of observations and rules which, though already enunciated, and applied in the criticism of the profane writers, had never rigorously been employed in biblical exegesis. He was, in fact, the founder of the grammatico-historical school. He admits in the sacred writings as in the classics only one acceptation, and that the grammatical, convertible into and the same with the logical and historical. Consequently, he censures the opinion of those who in the illustration of the Scriptures refer everything to the illumination of the Holy Spirit, as well as that of others who, disregarding all knowledge of the languages, would explain words by things. The &quot;analogy of faith,&quot; as a rule of interpretation, he greatly limits, and teaches that it can never afford of itself the explanation, of words, but only determine the choice among their possible meanings. At the same time he seems unconscious of any inconsistency between the doctrine of the inspiration of the Bible as usually received and his principles of hermeneutics.

== Conflict with J. S. Bach ==
Beginning in 1736, Ernesti became involved in a protracted dispute with J. S. Bach, who was cantor at the Thomas school at the time. The dispute concerned the appointment of a student prefect to lead musical performances whom Bach objected to, on grounds Ernesti considered spurious. This acrimonious conflict resulted in multiple letters to city officials and ultimately the king, despite the fact that Ernesti had served as godfather to Bach&#x27;s children.

== Legacy ==
Ernesti&#x27;s most notable follower was the German theologian .

His work influenced Johann Gottfried Herder and Friedrich Schleiermacher.

<text>Gottlieb Christoph Harless (originally Harles) (21 June 1738 – 2 November 1815) was a German classical scholar and bibliographer.

==Biography==
He was born at Culmbach in Bavaria. He studied at the universities of Halle, Erlangen and Jena. In 1765 he was appointed professor of oriental languages and eloquence at the Gymnasium Casimirianum in Coburg, in 1770 professor of poetry and eloquence at Erlangen, and in 1776 librarian of the university. He held his professorship for forty-five years until his death.

Harless was an extremely prolific writer. His numerous editions of classical authors lack originality and critical judgment, but were valuable at the time because they summarised earlier scholarship for the benefit of the student. He is chiefly remembered for his work in connection with the great &quot;Bibliotheca Graeca&quot; of J. A. Fabricius, of which he published a new and revised edition (12 vols., 1790–1809, not quite completed) — a task for which he was uniquely qualified. He also wrote much on the history and bibliography of Greek and Latin literature.

His biography was written by his son, Johann Christian Friedrich Harless (1818).

<text>Johann Albrecht Friedrich August Meineke (also &quot;Augustus Meineke&quot;; ; 8 December 179012 December 1870), German classical scholar, was born at Soest in the Duchy of Westphalia. He was father-in-law to philologist Theodor Bergk.

He obtained his education at the University of Leipzig as a student of Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann. After holding an educational post at Danzig (now Gdańsk, Poland), he was director of the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin from 1826 to 1856. In 1830 he became a member of the Berlin Academy. He died in Berlin on 12 December 1870.

He excelled in conjectural criticism, the comic writers and Alexandrine poets being his favourite authors. He was the first scholar since Richard Bentley to distinguish himself in the critical analyses of Menander and Philemon.

<text>In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe, LCARS (; an acronym for Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) is a computer operating system. Within &quot;Star Trek&quot; chronology, the term was first used in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; series.

==Production==
The LCARS graphical user interface was designed by scenic art supervisor and technical consultant Michael Okuda. The original design concept was influenced by a request from Gene Roddenberry that the instrument panels not have a great deal of activity on them. This minimalized look was designed to give a sense that the technology was much more advanced than in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

On &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, many of the buttons were labeled with the initials of members of the production crew and were referred to as &quot;Okudagrams.&quot;

==PADD==

The LCARS interface is often seen used on a PADD (&quot;Personal Access Display Device&quot;), a hand-held computer.

At , similarly sized modern tablet computers such as the Nexus 7, Amazon Fire, BlackBerry PlayBook, and iPad Mini have been compared with the PADD. Several mobile apps were created which offered an LCARS-style interface.

==Legal==
CBS Television Studios claims to hold the copyright on LCARS. Google was sent a DMCA letter to remove the Android app called Tricorder since its use of the LCARS interface was un-licensed. The application was later re-uploaded under a different title, but it was removed again.
