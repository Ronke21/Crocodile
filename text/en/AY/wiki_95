<text>Rebel Yell is the second studio album by the English rock singer Billy Idol, released on 10 November 1983 by Chrysalis Records. After the release of his 1982 eponymous debut studio album, Idol continued his collaboration with producer Keith Forsey and multi-instrumentalist Steve Stevens. The album was recorded at Electric Lady Studios in New York. Initially recording without a drummer, utilizing only the LinnDrum and Roland TR-808 drum machines, Forsey and Stevens later decided to hire Thommy Price to play drums on some of the songs. Musically, &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; is a new wave album with hard rock and other influences. The cover sleeve and images were shot by Brian Griffin. Idol got the idea of the album&#x27;s title after attending a party with the Rolling Stones and drinking Rebel Yell bourbon whiskey.

== Background and recording ==
&quot;Rebel Yell&quot; reunited the hit-making team of Idol, Steve Stevens, and Keith Forsey after their success with Idol&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Billy Idol&quot; (1982). Idol got the idea to name the album &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; after attending a party with the Rolling Stones. He explained on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; that people were drinking Rebel Yell bourbon whiskey and he thought that would be a great title for an album. The title track was recorded in only three days at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.

Working with Forsey were guitarist Steve Stevens, bassist Phil Feit and later Steve Webster, drummer Gregg Gerson, and keyboardists Judi Dozier and Jack Waldman. Drummer Thommy Price was brought in towards the end of the recording sessions.

== Cover art ==
When &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; was in production, Idol had a disagreement with his record company over the image that would be used on the album cover: he saw it as flawed, but the company refused to change it. In response, Idol decided to steal the master tapes for the album and give them to his drug dealer so that he could blackmail the company, saying, &quot;This guy I&#x27;ve given them to, he&#x27;ll have them out on the street bootlegged in a couple of days if you don&#x27;t change this picture.&quot; Forsey later recounted that Idol had actually taken the wrong tapes: &quot;I let him think he had the masters... He did whatever he had to do with the label. Everything was squared away, and then he came back and I said, &#x27;By the way, Bill, I&#x27;ve got the real masters.&#x27;&quot;

== Release and critical reception ==
&quot;Rebel Yell&quot; was released to commercial success. In the United States, the album peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it also peaked in the top ten in other countries, including Canada, Germany, and New Zealand. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it double platinum for shipments of two million copies across the United States. Four singles – &quot;Rebel Yell&quot;, &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot;, &quot;Flesh for Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Catch My Fall&quot; – were released from the album. The accompanying music videos for all singles received heavy airplay on television channel MTV. Idol&#x27;s longtime girlfriend Perri Lister can be seen in the front row during the video for &quot;Rebel Yell&quot;.

Upon its release, &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Parke Puterbaugh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a ferocious record, sharp as a saber, hard as diamond, as beautiful and seductive as the darker side of life with which it flirts&quot;, and ultimately &quot;an intelligent assault upon the senses&quot; at a time &quot;when too much of what comes over the airwaves is all sweetness and light, or mere undifferentiated head-banging&quot;. In &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Kimberley Leston praised Idol and Stevens for &quot;stirring together rock, disco and punk elements without forgetting the importance of a good tune.&quot; Robert Christgau, however, suggested in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that music videos &quot;have been the making of this born poser&#x27;s career and the unmaking of his music&quot;, quipping, &quot;if you&#x27;ve got no taste for the sound of the sneer, the visuals definitely aren&#x27;t fantasy enough.&quot;

In the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield highlighted the wide-ranging music on &quot;Rebel Yell&quot;, calling it &quot;a brilliant combination of punk, disco, synth pop, glam rock, metal, and mud wrestling&quot;. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine concluded, &quot;Each stylistic turn is distinguished by Idol&#x27;s gusto. He&#x27;s unafraid to be gloriously, shameless tacky, a quality that separated him from his new wave peers then and continues to give &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; a trashy kick years after its release.&quot; Writing for &quot;Record Collector&quot;, Simon Price deemed it &quot;essentially a dance record&quot;, crediting Forsey with taking influence from krautrock and disco &quot;to machine-tool Billy Idol&#x27;s music into an irresistibly metronomic force&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot;″s Dom Lawson lauded &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; as &quot;an 80s hard rock pinnacle&quot; which marked Idol&#x27;s &quot;transformation into the ultimate MTV-generation rock star&quot;.

In 1999, EMI Music reissued &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; as part of their &quot;Expanded&quot; series. The new version of the album included previously unreleased bonus tracks and expanded liner notes. In 2010, audiophile label Audio Fidelity reissued a 24-karat CD remastered in HDCD by Steve Hoffman.

<text>Bligh Reef, sometimes known as Bligh Island Reef, is a reef off the coast of Bligh Island in Prince William Sound, Alaska. This was the location of the 1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill. After the incident, 33 US Code § 2733 mandated the operation of an automated navigation light to prevent future collisions with the reef. Despite these efforts the tug &quot;Pathfinder&quot; ran aground on Bligh Reef on Dec 24, 2009, rupturing its tanks and spilling diesel fuel. Bligh Reef is also where Alaska Steamship Company&#x27;s &quot;Olympia&quot; ran aground in 1910.

Bligh Reef serves as a fishing ground for halibut and a harvesting area for shrimp. The nearest town is Tatitlek, which lies to the northeast.

The reef was named after William Bligh, of future HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; fame, who served as Master aboard ship during James Cook&#x27;s third world voyage.

<doc id="197931" wikidata="Q2534690" url="?curid=197931" title="Dysfunction (album)">
<text>Dysfunction is the second studio album by American rock band Staind, released on April 13, 1999, by Flip Records and Elektra Records. It is the band&#x27;s first studio album released on a record label. 

Staind self-released their debut album &quot;Tormented&quot; in 1996. On October 23, 1997, the band met Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst. Durst was initially appalled by &quot;Tormented&quot; graphic artwork, and refused to sign Staind, but changed his mind after being impressed with the band&#x27;s performance. Durst signed the band to Flip/Elektra and helped the band record &quot;Dysfunction&quot;. Staind promoted &quot;Dysfunction&quot; through touring and sampler cassettes.

Continuing, but expanding on, the dark alternative metal and nu metal sound displayed on &quot;Tormented&quot;, &quot;Dysfunction&quot; features a varied increase of singing and screaming, emotionally vulnerable lyrics inspired by singer Aaron Lewis&#x27; life, with a noticeable increase of melodic sections. Although still similar to &quot;Tormented&quot; in tone, &quot;Dysfunction&quot; is more melodic, has an absence of lo-fi production, and, despite prominent 
moments of screaming, features more clean singing than &quot;Tormented&quot;. Critics compared &quot;Dysfunction&quot; to various bands, including Korn, Coal Chamber, Spineshank, Nothingface, Deftones, Tool, and Alice in Chains.

&quot;Dysfunction&quot; received mostly mixed reviews upon release; some critics praising Lewis&#x27; vocals and lyrics, as well as Murshok&#x27;s guitar playing, while some criticized the album for being repetitive in terms of song structure. Despite little success upon release, the album grew into mainstream popularity at the end of 1999 with the success of the singles &quot;Just Go&quot;, &quot;Mudshovel&quot; and &quot;Home&quot;, eventually peaking at number 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in November of that year. After the release of Staind&#x27;s next album &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; (2001), &quot;Dysfunction&quot; experienced a resurgence in popularity and reached number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. In February 2004, the album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), signifying the shipment of two million copies in the United States.

==Background and recording==
Staind self-released its debut album &quot;Tormented&quot; in 1996. On October 23, 1997, Staind met Limp Bizkit vocalist Fred Durst at the Webster Theater in Hartford, Connecticut. Staind showed Durst a copy of &quot;Tormented&quot; and Durst was appalled by the album cover, which depicts a bloody Barbie doll on a crucifix with nails hanging from a plastic frame, a buried person with a rosary protruding from the person&#x27;s nose, and a knife impaling a Bible. Durst assumed the band were Theistic Satanists.

Despite initially trying to remove Staind from opening for Limp Bizkit due to the album cover of &quot;Tormented&quot;, Fred Durst was impressed with Staind&#x27;s performance and changed his mind. After hearing their four-song demo, Durst signed Staind to Flip/Elektra to record the band&#x27;s album &quot;Dysfunction&quot;. Durst and Staind then traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, to begin developing and recording new songs, and after a meeting with Flip, Staind recorded a three-track sampler in Los Angeles, California. By February 1998, they acquired a record contract and, after performing on the summer Warped Tour, began recording &quot;Dysfunction&quot; in August 1998. &quot;Dysfunction&quot; was recorded at Studio Litho and mixed at Studio X in Seattle, Washington. Durst introduced Staind to Terry Date. Date said that after hearing the singing voice of Staind lead singer Aaron Lewis, he instantly thought Lewis&#x27;s &quot;voice was pretty undeniable.&quot; While Durst did most of &quot;Dysfunction&quot; preproduction work, &quot;Date said his only challenge was to capture the explosive live feel of the band and help bring out both their melodic and hard sensibilities.&quot; After working with Durst in Jacksonville, Staind moved back to their hometown Springfield, Massachusetts, to write songs like &quot;Me&quot;, &quot;Just Go&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, and some other songs from &quot;Dysfunction&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
Staind&#x27;s vocalist, Aaron Lewis, has stated he feels that, &quot;&quot;Dysfunction&quot; was a huge step away from &quot;Tormented&quot;.&quot; Guitarist Mike Mushok expressed frustration in how label personnel were in no way intrusive on the production of &quot;Dysfunction&quot;, but after it sold over a million copies, the band would be relentlessly hassled during the production of future albums. Considered nu metal and alternative metal, &quot;Dysfunction&quot; is known for featuring both singing and screaming. The album is also known for featuring songs with slow parts that then turn into aggressive parts with screaming. The album&#x27;s lyrics are noted for being either angry or depressing. Gil Kaufman of MTV wrote that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t share the heavy influence of the band&#x27;s new pals. Staind&#x27;s aggressive sound mixes the industrial crunch of Tool with the morose, heavy rock of Seattle grunge-rockers Alice in Chains.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; compared &quot;Dysfunction&quot; to Deftones&#x27; &quot;Adrenaline&quot;, Spineshank, Nothingface&#x27;s &quot;Pacifier&quot;, Coal Chamber, and &quot;Korn&#x27;s moments&quot;. Lewis said of &quot;Dysfunction&quot; lyrics: &quot;All the lyrics are about me,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called &quot;Dysfunction&quot;. It&#x27;s just a list of all the fucked-up shit I&#x27;ve gone through in life.&quot; Although &quot;Dysfunction&quot; features some screaming in some songs, the album features less screaming than &quot;Tormented&quot;, and is a lot more melodic than &quot;Tormented&quot;. Durst encouraged Lewis to use more melody in his voice after being impressed by Lewis&#x27; singing voice. After describing &quot;Tormented&quot; as &quot;one long rush of hardcore brat-rage, a 900mph scream of a man smashing his head against a wall in frustration&quot;, Tommy Udo wrote in his book &quot;Brave Nu World&quot;: &quot;1999&#x27;s &quot;Dysfunction&quot; is the sound of a band trying to get to grips with all the anger and shape something else that will reach beyond the hard core of devotees; not &#x27;selling out&#x27; or &#x27;going commercial&#x27;, just making it bearable.&quot;

==Promotion and touring==
Staind released three singles for the album: &quot;Just Go/Suffocate&quot;, &quot;Mudshovel&quot;, and &quot;Home&quot;. Elektra Records promoted Staind in 1998. Dane Venable of Elektra said: &quot;Before we started with radio, we tried to develop a fan presence through a street-awareness campaign.&quot; In 1998, Elektra began &quot;with 20,000 Staind sampler cassettes, stickers, and a letter from Fred Durst endorsing the band, and that letter went out to the entire Limp Bizkit fan club list.&quot; To promote &quot;Dysfunction&quot;, Staind joined the Family Values Tour in 1999 and also opened for Limp Bizkit. The songs &quot;Just Go&quot;, &quot;Mudshovel&quot;, and &quot;Home&quot; received airplay on MTV and The Box. HBO&#x27;s &quot;Reverb&quot; filmed Staind in 1999 for an episode that was scheduled to air in November 1999. Staind joined Korn for Korn&#x27;s Sick and Twisted Tour in 2000 and Staind also joined MTV&#x27;s Return of the Rock tour. Staind began to receive significantly more attention with the mainstream success of the song &quot;Outside&quot; in early 2001. An acoustic version of the song featuring Durst peaked at number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on March 10, 2001, remaining on the chart for 19 weeks. In March, this version also peaked at number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and stayed on the chart for 26 weeks and peaked at number 2 on the Alternative Songs chart and remained on the chart for 25 weeks.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Dysfunction&quot; received mostly mixed reviews. &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; gave the album a positive review and wrote: &quot;Generally, Lewis&#x27;s plaintive, melodic and often beautiful crooning is pierced by spine-weakening guitar licks, making Staind a stand-out in the &#x27;new metal&#x27; domain.&quot; AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;Other listeners, however, will likely find Dysfunction a little tedious, since there isn&#x27;t a wide variety of songs on the record, nor is there anything catchy. That, of course, is a signature trait of alt-metal and helps make the record a sign of the times -- but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an easy record to enjoy for anyone outside of the cognoscenti.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; panned the album and wrote &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if his voice didn&#x27;t bring to mind Eddie Vedder being fisted in jail.&quot; Attrition.org gave the album a positive review, writing: &quot;Dysfunction is definitely an album I would suggest to anyone who really gets into music. I suggest sitting down and listening to Aaron&#x27;s amazing vocals along with the guitars of Dysfunction from beginning to the end.&quot; &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot; described the album as &quot;an impressive start&quot; and acclaimed the album but criticized the song &quot;Crawl&quot; for the song&#x27;s &quot;annoying guitar riff&quot;, calling &quot;Crawl&quot; &quot;the only short stick on the disc.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Dysfunction&quot; achieved a limited amount of success at first, selling only 29,000 copies and debuting at number 173 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album then peaked at number 74 on the chart on November 6, 1999, and was on the chart for 56 weeks. In July 1999, Elektra Records reported that &quot;Dysfunction&quot; had sold 75,000 copies. Due to the album&#x27;s rise in mainstream success, the album entered number 10 on and peaked at number 1 on the Heatseekers Albums chart on May 1, 1999, and October 9, 1999, respectively. &quot;Dysfunction&quot; stayed on the chart for 24 weeks. Although &quot;Dysfunction&quot; failed to achieve immediate success, the album began to achieve success months after its release. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on November 5, 1999 with sales of over 500,000 copies reported in January 2000. &quot;Dysfunction&quot; was certified platinum by the RIAA on June 14, 2000 with sales of 1,126,000 copies reported in June 2001.

The singles for &quot;Dysfunction&quot; received a lot of radio play on rock radio. &quot;Mudshovel&quot; peaked at number 10 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and stayed there for 28 weeks whereas &quot;Home&quot; peaked at number 11 on the same chart and remained there for 26 weeks. &quot;Dysfunction&quot; was ranked number 174 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 2000 year-end chart for &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums.

<doc id="197938" wikidata="Q1646081" url="?curid=197938" title="Piano Man (Billy Joel album)">
<text>Piano Man is the second studio album by American recording artist Billy Joel, released on November 14, 1973, by Columbia Records. The album emerged from legal difficulties with Joel&#x27;s former label, Family Productions, and ultimately became his first breakthrough album.

The title track, a fictionalized retelling of Joel&#x27;s experiences with people he met as a lounge singer in Los Angeles, peaked at on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and on the Adult Contemporary singles chart. &quot;Travelin&#x27; Prayer&quot; and &quot;Worse Comes to Worst&quot; peaked at No. 77 and 80 on the Hot 100, respectively, while the album itself peaked at on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in 1975, but Joel received only $8,000 in royalties (US$ in dollars).

== Legacy edition ==
Columbia Records released a two-disc legacy version of &quot;Piano Man&quot; in November 2011.

This edition features a somewhat abbreviated live 1972 broadcast from Philadelphia&#x27;s Philadelphia 93.3 WMMR FM radio, capturing early performances by Joel recorded at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia. This particular broadcast was instrumental in catalyzing Joel&#x27;s musical career. Following the recording of the show, the live rendition of &quot;Captain Jack&quot; became a staple on the station, ultimately becoming the most requested song in WMMR&#x27;s history. The burgeoning popularity of this live recording attracted the attention of Columbia Records executives, who subsequently offered Joel a recording contract. Additionally, the broadcast included three tracks— &quot;Long, Long Time,&quot; &quot;Josephine,&quot; and &quot;Rosalinda&quot;—which were not featured on any of Joel&#x27;s studio albums.

<text>Debut is the international debut studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk, released in July 1993 by One Little Indian and Elektra Entertainment. It was produced by Björk and Nellee Hooper. It was Björk&#x27;s first recording following the dissolution of her previous band, the Sugarcubes. The album departed from the rock style of her previous work and drew from an eclectic variety of styles, including electronic pop, house music, jazz and trip hop.

&quot;Debut&quot; received critical acclaim from British music critics, though American reviews were mixed. It exceeded sales expectations, charting at number two in Iceland, three in the United Kingdom, and 61 in the US. It was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the US, where it remains Björk&#x27;s best-selling album.

Five singles were released from &quot;Debut&quot;: &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot;, &quot;Play Dead&quot;, &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; and &quot;Violently Happy&quot;. All charted in the UK, with only &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Violently Happy&quot; and &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; charting on dance and modern rock charts in the US.

== Background and production ==

While performing as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes, Björk approached Ásmundur Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette of her own songs. The demo included versions of songs that appeared on &quot;Debut&quot;, including &quot;The Anchor Song&quot; and &quot;Aeroplane&quot;. After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, Björk moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked on the details of what would become &quot;Debut&quot;. The Sugarcubes&#x27; music did not fit Björk&#x27;s taste, and her contact with London&#x27;s underground club culture of the late 1980s and early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: &quot;As a music nerd, I just had to follow my heart, and my heart was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I&#x27;m understanding more and more as I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp.&quot;

Björk had already written half the songs for &quot;Debut&quot;, but had nothing recorded. She had written many of them years before moving to London, including &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, which she wrote as a teenager when she was in the Sugarcubes. She had put aside the songs as &quot;I was in punk bands and [the songs] weren&#x27;t punk&quot;. With no producer, she composed songs with 808 State member Graham Massey in a friend&#x27;s home in Manchester, where she also wrote songs included on later albums, including &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;The Modern Things&quot;.

While creating electronic tracks with Massey, Björk developed a desire to work with a jazz producer. Paul Fox, who had worked with the Sugarcubes, introduced her to jazz harpist Corky Hale. Hale had planned to decline to work with Björk until her stepson, a Sugarcubes fan, insisted that she take the job. Björk recorded a handful of jazz standards with Hale in 1991, including &quot;I Remember You&quot; and an early version of &quot;Like Someone in Love&quot;; the latter song was included in &quot;Debut&quot;″s track listing. Fox also introduced Björk to Oliver Lake, with whom Björk recorded another jazz standard, &quot;Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries&quot;, with Lake&#x27;s jazz group for the John Hughes film &quot;Curly Sue&quot;. Hughes turned down the recording, but it led to &quot;Debut&quot; being produced by Fox and arranged by Oliver Lake. Björk contracted Lake to work with session saxophonists in London for &quot;Debut;&quot; Lake&#x27;s contributions are heard on tracks including &quot;Aeroplane&quot; and &quot;The Anchor Song&quot;.

Björk intended to have several producers work on the album. She planned to have the album produced with Fox until she was introduced to producer Nellee Hooper by her boyfriend Dominic Thrupp. Hooper had produced albums by Soul II Soul and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor which made Björk skeptical about working with him, stating: &quot;I thought Nellee was too &#x27;good taste&#x27; for my liking. But then I met him, got to know him, [and] got to hear about his fabulous ideas.&quot; Björk and Hooper&#x27;s recording ideas were similar, which led to her decision to end production with Massey and Fox. Hooper introduced Björk to studio technology and studio programmer Marius de Vries, who gave &quot;Debut&quot; a modern style with keyboards and synthesizers. He produced the first ten tracks on the album, while Björk co-produced &quot;Like Someone in Love&quot; with Hooper and produced &quot;The Anchor Song&quot; alone. Björk and Hooper spent many sessions in the studio working on &quot;Debut&quot; until the album was finished in early 1993.

==Composition==

&quot;Debut&quot; draws on an eclectic variety of sources. &quot;Treblezine&quot; described the album as &quot;[melding] alternative dance and electronic with a graceful flow.&quot; It is said that the album &quot;[shook] the status quo&quot; of the contemporary musical climate, in the sense that its eclectic experimental pop leanings distanced it from the music &quot;primarily being made by men with guitars&quot; that was popular at the time, such as grunge and the burgeoning Britpop. Michael Cragg of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as an &quot;indefinable conflation of electronic pop, trip-hop, world music and otherworldly lyrics&quot;. AllMusic described the album as &quot;creative, tantalizing electronic pop.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Debut&quot; often recalls the early &#x27;70s jazz-fusion of bands like Weather Report. But where these fusionists combined jazz harmony with funk and acid rock, Björk marries her scat-vocalese and off-kilter melodies with the futuristic textures and programmed percussion of today&#x27;s techno and acid house. &quot;The Face&quot;″s Mandi James felt &quot;Debut&quot; was &quot;a delightful fusion of thrash metal, jazz, funk and opera, with the odd dash of exotica thrown in for good measure.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; described the album as &quot;an art pop masterpiece&quot;. Björk also took influence from the music of Bollywood and &quot;the buzz of London nightlife.&quot;

&quot;Debut&quot; incorporates dance music, reflecting the contemporary styles of London&#x27;s club culture, with which Björk had established close ties. While elements of subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM are present, &quot;they hadn&#x27;t yet broken free from the primal thump of four-on-the-floor house music.&quot; Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; wrote that &quot;even as dance music took on all these new sounds, that basic pulse was still the most important thing about it, and that pulse reverberates all through &quot;Debut&quot;.&quot; Björk said: &quot;A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they&#x27;re beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs.&quot; The four on the floor style, typical of house music, is evident in songs such as &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Crying&quot;, &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s More to Life Than This&quot; and &quot;Violently Happy&quot;.

Björk felt house music was &quot;the only pop music that [was] truly modern,&quot; stating in 1993 that it was &quot;the only music where anything creative is happening today.&quot; Her departure from the guitar-driven rock of her previous work stemmed from the feeling that it was outdated, arguing that &quot;as soon as any form becomes traditional, like the guitar, bass and drums, then people start to behave traditionally,&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s really difficult to get a band to stay on the edge using typical bass, guitar and drums setup because it tends to lapse into a predictable form.&quot; Being a fan of dance music since the early days of acid house, she used it as the framework for her songs. She told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that she &quot;was more influenced by ambient music than what you&#x27;d call dance music, and by things that were happening way back in Chicago and Detroit that were sensual and daring and groundbreaking in their time [...] Ninety-five percent of the dance music you hear today is crap. It&#x27;s only that experimental five percent that I&#x27;m into—the records that get played in clubs after 7 o&#x27;clock in the morning, when the DJs are playing stuff for themselves, rather than trying to please people.&quot; Björk&#x27;s embrace of England&#x27;s dance culture also extended to her image, considered representative of 1990s acid house fashion.

Hooper had been a member of Bristol&#x27;s &quot;Wild Bunch&quot;, a group that took from acid jazz, funk and hip hop and helped create trip-hop. The less dance-oriented electronic &quot;Debut&quot; tracks have a more trip-hop style sound and a &quot;more delicate atmosphere&quot;. &quot;i-D&quot; noted that &quot;Debut&quot;—and Björk&#x27;s subsequent album &quot;Post&quot;—integrate ambient techno and jungle, stating that they &quot;couldn&#x27;t have existed without Aphex Twin, Black Dog, A Guy Called Gerald, LFO and all the other producers who reshaped the language of music since 1988.&quot; Also present are elements of jazz, with WUOG stating that &quot;while many see &quot;Debut&quot; as Björk&#x27;s clubbiest album, it may also be her jazziest.&quot; Brad Shoup of &quot;Stereogum&quot; wrote that &quot;though her electronic bent gets the most attention, it&#x27;s her interest in jazz that courses through the set.&quot; Tim Perlich of &quot;Now&quot; felt &quot;Debut&quot; &quot;bridges jazz and pop&quot;, and Simon Reynolds characterized it as &quot;jazzy love songs tinged with an oceanic feeling.&quot;

===Songs===
The lyrics of &quot;Debut&quot; contain themes of love. They range from &quot;flesh-and-blood passion&quot; for another person to the love of life itself. According to &quot;i-D&quot;, with a couple of exceptions, the songs of &quot;Debut&quot; fell into two types: &quot;those where Björk addressed the listener as someone in pain and told them fireworks would light their nights and all would be well;&quot; and &quot;songs where she sang about her own pain.&quot; &quot;The Face&quot; stated that the album&#x27;s lyrics &quot;[consolidated] her love affair with language,&quot; while &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; felt that Björk &quot;rigorously [avoided] the obvious&quot; by using lyrics that do not rhyme.

The first track &quot;Human Behaviour&quot; features a &quot;bouncing riff&quot; sampled from Antônio Carlos Jobim, with &quot;its syncopated beat consigned to a venerable orchestral instrument, the timpani.&quot; Its lyrics refer to Björk&#x27;s experience as a child, finding the behaviour of adults &quot;rather chaotic and nonsensical,&quot; instead finding harmony with other children, nature and animals. Inspired by naturalist David Attenborough, she sings from the point of view of an animal, with its opening line being &quot;If you ever get close to a human/And human behaviour/Be ready, be ready to get confused&quot;. Following track &quot;Crying&quot; shows a contradiction between its &quot;bubbly, shiny-surfaced acid disco-pop&quot; sound and lyrics that describe the turmoil of feeling alienated in a big city. &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot;—considered an ambient track by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;—reflected Björk&#x27;s newly found interest in Bollywood, having befriended people of Indian origin in London, most notably tabla player Talvin Singh. In a spontaneous fashion, the song&#x27;s strings—and also those of &quot;Come to Me&quot;—were recorded by a film studio orchestra in India, thanks to Singh. The lyrics of the track are about the sensitivity of her then boyfriend Dominic Thrupp, with lyrics that have been described as &quot;sweet and just the slightest bit naughty.&quot; In the dancefloor-oriented &quot;There&#x27;s More to Life Than This&quot;, Björk leaves romance behind, with &quot;her mischievous side [coming] to the fore&quot;. Its lyrics were inspired by a party she attended and promptly left. &quot;Like Someone in Love&quot; is one of the several jazz standards she recorded with Corky Hale, with her voice &quot;cradled in harp and swoony strings.&quot;

&quot;Like Someone in Love&quot; is followed by the techno-tinged &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; in an &quot;intentionally startling&quot; leap. An &quot;anthem to emotional bravery,&quot; it contains lyrics described as &quot;simple but passionate&quot;, concerning Björk&#x27;s relationship with her co-producer Nellee Hooper. The songs &quot;The Anchor Song&quot;, &quot;One Day&quot;, and &quot;Aeroplane&quot; draw on what Björk refers to as her more &quot;academic, clever side&quot;. &quot;One Day&quot; also presents a sudden shift of mood, featuring a &quot;gently pulsing bass&quot; that builds into an &quot;itchily impassioned, housey pop euphoria.&quot; &quot;Aeroplane&quot; is one of &quot;Debut&quot;″s most musically complicated pieces with off-kilter arrangement from Oliver Lake; its backdrop is inspired by exotica music. This song is also about Thrupp, written when he was living in the United Kingdom and Björk still lived in Iceland. &quot;Come to Me&quot; features a &quot;hazy musical backdrop of raindrop synths, padded drums and sweeping strings&quot;; lyrically, it explores a &quot;sensually intense need to nurture.&quot; &quot;Violently Happy&quot; is the most hardcore techno track on the album. In the song, over &quot;brisk house beats&quot; Björk sings in a stammering fashion, as she &quot;struggles to express feelings of excitement so intense she seems on the brink of leaping out of her skin.&quot; As a gesture to inexpressible feelings, the song samples one syllable and &quot;[turns] it into a stuttering vocal tic.&quot; The closing track &quot;The Anchor Song&quot; is the only one in the album solely produced by Björk. One of the three songs to appear on her first demo cassette of 1990, it features Oliver Lake playing the saxophone, in an arrangement that replicated the &quot;ebb and tide of an ocean&#x27;s peaking tops, an image reinforced by Björk&#x27;s fiercely patriotic lyrics.&quot; The album&#x27;s version of &quot;The Anchor Song&quot; was recorded with session saxophonist Gary Barnacle.

== Release ==
When Björk announced the release of her international debut in 1992, she called it with the title &quot;Björk&#x27;s Affairs&quot;. However, it was later changed to &quot;Debut&quot; since it marked Björk&#x27;s first album of self-composed material. &quot;Debut&quot; was released on 5 July 1993 on compact disc and cassette on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and 13 July 1993 on Elektra Records in the United States. One Little Indian estimated that &quot;Debut&quot; would sell a total of 40,000 copies worldwide based on a guess of the Sugarcubes fan base at the time. However, within three months of &quot;Debut&#x27;s&quot; release, over 600,000 copies had been sold worldwide. On the album&#x27;s initial release, it charted in the United States, peaking at number one on the Top Heatseekers chart and at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Debut&quot; entered the charts on 17 July 1993, peaking at number three and spending 79 weeks on the chart. Overseas in Japan, &quot;Debut&quot; was released on 26 September 1993. &quot;Debut&quot; has been re-issued several times in different formats. In November 1993, the album was re-issued in the United Kingdom with the bonus track &quot;Play Dead&quot;, a song written for the film &quot;The Young Americans&quot;, shortly after &quot;Debut&quot;&#x27;s completion. The album was later issued on vinyl and DualDisc formats. The Japanese version of &quot;Debut&quot; included two bonus tracks: &quot;Play Dead&quot; and &quot;Atlantic&quot;. The DualDisc release featured the full album on the CD side while the DVD side included the album with superior sound quality and the music videos for the singles. On 5 May 1994, The Canadian Recording Industry Association certified that &quot;Debut&quot; had sold over 50,000 units making it a Gold record in Canada. On 31 August 2001, the RIAA certified that &quot;Debut&quot; had sold over one million units making it a Platinum record in the United States. As of January 2015, &quot;Debut&quot; had sold 930,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Worldwide sales of the album stand at 4.7 million copies.

In 1994, Björk was sued by Simon Fisher, a musician she collaborated with in 1990. Fisher&#x27;s claim stated that he had co-written &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot;, &quot;Crying&quot;, and &quot;Aeroplane&quot; and sought damages of over £200,000. Hooper and Björk went to court with Fisher shortly after the release of Björk&#x27;s album &quot;Post&quot;. Judge Robin Jacob found Fisher only seeking credit for one song instead of four and cleared Hooper and Björk of all charges stating that Fisher&#x27;s charges rendered him &quot;unreliable, diffuse, and vague&quot;.

=== Singles ===
In 1993 Björk contacted French director Michel Gondry to create a music video for &quot;Human Behaviour&quot; after seeing a video he made for his own band Oui Oui. &quot;Human Behaviour&quot; was the first single taken from &quot;Debut&quot;, and was issued a month before the album&#x27;s release in June 1993. Three more singles were released from &quot;Debut&quot; in 1993. &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot; was the second single, released in August with a music video directed by Sophie Muller. &quot;Play Dead&quot; was released in August 1993 as a non-album single, that would be included on later releases of the album. &quot;Play Dead&quot; had an accompanying music video directed by Danny Cannon. The final single released in 1993 was &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; remixed by Fluke with a music video by Stéphane Sednaoui. A further single, &quot;Violently Happy&quot;, was released in March 1994 with an accompanying video by Jean-Baptiste Mondino. All five singles from &quot;Debut&quot; charted within the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart while only &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;, &quot;Violently Happy&quot; and &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

== Critical reception ==
At the 1994 Grammy Awards, Michel Gondry&#x27;s music video for &quot;Human Behaviour&quot; was nominated for Best Short Form Music Video, but lost to Stephen Johnson&#x27;s video for the Peter Gabriel song &quot;Steam&quot;. At the 1994 Brit Awards, Björk won awards for &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; and &quot;Best International Female&quot;.

Critical reaction to &quot;Debut&quot; was generally positive. The British music press spoke positively about the album, with &quot;Q&quot; giving it four out of five stars calling it &quot;a surprising, playful collection&quot; while the &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;Debut&quot; was &quot;an album that believes music can be magical and special.&quot; &quot;The Independent&quot; gave &quot;Debut&quot; a favorable review noting that Björk had &quot;fashioned an amazing array of contrasting arrangements, whose musical diversity never interferes with their clarity of vision.&quot; American reception was more mixed. &quot;Musician&quot; magazine praised the vocals of the album, stating &quot;what makes [Björk&#x27;s] singing memorable isn&#x27;t the odd assortment of growls, moans and chirps she relies upon, but the emotions those sounds convey.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Debut&quot; as &quot;an enchanting album&quot;.
A negative review came from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who gave the album two stars out of five, labelling the album &quot;utterly disappointing&quot; and blaming producer Nellee Hooper, suggesting he &quot;sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry.&quot; Michele Romero of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a C, saying, &quot;On a few songs, [Björk&#x27;s] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube-like techno-tunes. But most of &quot;Debut&quot; sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box. Wind it up if you like – eventually it will stop.&quot; &quot;Debut&quot; rated highly in British end of year polls. The &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Debut&quot; at number one on their list of &quot;Top 50 LPs of 1993&quot;. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; placed the album at number six on their list of &quot;Albums of the Year for 1993&quot; calling it &quot;a fantastic debut&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Q&quot; included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. In 2000 it was voted number 77 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she&#x27;d &quot;delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham, I&#x27;d have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones&quot; and that &quot;Debut&quot; &quot;was a bit of a rehearsal and it&#x27;s really not that good. I can do much better.&quot;

Later reception was also positive. In &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s alternative record guide, the album received a rating of nine out of ten stating that the choice of Nellee Hooper as producer was a &quot;stroke of genius&quot; and Björk&#x27;s vocals were &quot;awe-inspiring&quot;. Heather Phares of AllMusic gave the album a five-star rating, stating that &quot;Debut&quot; is &quot;Possibly her prettiest work, Björk&#x27;s horizons expanded on her other releases, but the album still sounds fresh, which is even more impressive considering electronic music&#x27;s whiplash-speed innovations.&quot;

==Legacy==

&quot;Debut&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of 1993 and the 1990s in general. In 2013, John Hamilton of &quot;Idolator&quot; called the album &quot;highly influential&quot;, and wrote &quot;in spite of its advancing age, &quot;Debut&quot;″s futurism has aged exquisitely.&quot; The album has also been credited as one of the first albums to introduce electronic music into mainstream pop. &quot;Stereogum&quot; Tom Breihan wrote: &quot;House music didn&#x27;t quite have critical respect before Björk came along, and plenty of American writers didn&#x27;t know what to make of the sound of &quot;Debut&quot; when it came out. [...] &quot;Debut&quot; didn&#x27;t just establish Björk; it helped make sounds like that cool to a segment of the music-dork universe that might&#x27;ve remained deaf to its charms otherwise. At this point, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to imagine a big publication slamming an adventurous dance-pop album for &quot;cheap electronic gimmickry,&quot; and &quot;Debut&quot; is a big part of that change.&quot; Björk&#x27;s embrace of England&#x27;s dance culture also extended to her looks, her style at the time considered representative of 1990s acid house fashion. Celebrating the album&#x27;s twenty-year anniversary, Emily Mackay of &quot;NME&quot; wrote the album &quot;put the lie to the post-grunge assumption that heartfelt, passionate solo artistry came in the form of acoustic guitar and heartbreak, creating a new breed of singer-songwriter.&quot; Dubbing it an &quot;influential masterpiece&quot;, she found influences of the album in the work of musicians such as M.I.A., Grimes, These New Puritans and Tune-Yards, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s in fascinatingly individual artists like those that you&#x27;ll find [Björk&#x27;s] influence – not, as many would have you believe, in every pretty-faced girl with a big voice.&quot; Mackay also noted that the album&#x27;s legacy echoes through dance-pop artists like Lady Gaga and Robyn.

In 2013, Michael Cragg of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;two decades after its release, the Icelandic artist&#x27;s first album has never sounded more relevant.&quot; He argued that &quot;Debut&quot; &quot;reconstructed pop music&quot;, also writing that &quot;while pop in 2013 looks back to the early 90s for inspiration, Björk&#x27;s ability on &quot;Debut&quot; to innovate by using disparate genres without losing a sense of her own identity should be the blueprint for any new artist with desires to break the mould.&quot; In the album&#x27;s entry in their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; —where the album was included at number 46—, &quot;NME&quot; claimed that &quot;&quot;Debut&quot; achieved the remarkable feat of turning an idiosyncratic vocalist from a feted cult band into a significant global pop star, without losing one iota of the experimental mindset and creative cool that made her so special.&quot; In 2005, Björk stated that she thought the album was not as strong as her later works: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to judge yourself but I don&#x27;t think [&quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; are] my best. &quot;Debut&quot; was the album that went the highest up there in terms of what is &#x27;Bjork music&#x27;. But I think that the persona I created, which was entirely accidental, is better captured on the later albums.&quot;

===Accolades===

&quot;Debut&quot; was also included in books such as &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Shake Your Money Maker (also stylized as The Black Crowes Present: $hake Your Money Maker) is the debut studio album by American rock band the Black Crowes, released on February 13, 1990, on Def American Recordings. It is the only album by the band to feature guitarist Jeff Cease. The album is named after a classic blues song written by Elmore James. The Black Crowes have played the song live many times over the years, but it is not included on this album.

&quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and two of its singles, &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; and &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot;, reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Jealous Again&quot;, &quot;Twice As Hard&quot; and &quot;Seeing Things&quot; were also charting singles in the United States. &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; is the Black Crowes&#x27; best selling album, having sold more than 5 million copies.

On January 8, 2021, the Black Crowes announced that a 30th anniversary edition of the album would be released on February 26, 2021. The new version contains the original tracks remastered in addition to three previously unreleased songs, outtakes, two demos from the Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden era, and a live performance set recorded in 1990 at Center Stage in Atlanta. Previously unreleased track &quot;Charming Mess&quot; was released on the same day as the announcement.

==Background and production==
Brothers Chris and Rich Robinson had formed Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden in 1984. In 1988 George Drakoulias saw the band at a show they did in New York City and had them signed to Def American the same year; they changed their name to the Black Crowes shortly after.

The recording sessions began in the summer of 1989 in Atlanta and Los Angeles, with Drakoulias producing the album. Some tracks include retained songs from the Mr. Crowe&#x27;s Garden era such as &quot;Could I&#x27;ve Been So Blind&quot; and &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot;, whose riff had been written years ago by then-17 year old Rich Robinson with lyrics written by Chris, which were inspired by a heroin-addicted girl he &quot;kinda knew&quot; in Atlanta. The band also chose to record a cover version of Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Hard to Handle&quot;, which would prove to be their breakthrough single.

Four music videos for &quot;Twice As Hard&quot;, &quot;Jealous Again&quot;, &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; and &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot; were filmed to promote the band and the album, and subsequently aired on MTV.

==Release and reception==
When the album came out in February 1990, critical reception was mostly favorable. Mark Coleman called &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; &quot;the kind of streamlined, supertight groove album that bar-band dreams are made of&quot; in a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, whose readers and critics later voted the Black Crowes &quot;Best New American Band&quot; at the end of 1990; the band appeared on the cover of the magazine&#x27;s 605th issue (May 1991) following their firing from the ZZ Top tour in March that year. The issue&#x27;s interview of Chris and Rich Robinson compared the band to 1970s acts, with journalist David Fricke explicitly citing Faces and the Rolling Stones and Rich Robinson mentioning Aerosmith. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Dave Marsh wrote, &quot;The Black Crowes are to the early Rolling Stones what Christian Slater is to the young Jack Nicholson: a self-conscious imitation, but fine enough in its own right. Authentic bluesmen these Crowes will never be, but their sheer energy earns &#x27;em the right to trash it up.&quot; &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; noted that while the band &quot;might have studied their sonic textbooks a little too closely, if the Crowes have more songs like these in store, they could be one of the biggest bands of the new decade.&quot; Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Steve Huey praised Rich Robinson&#x27;s guitar playing and Chris Robinson&#x27;s &quot;appropriate vocal swagger&quot;.

&quot;Hard to Handle&quot;, &quot;Jealous Again&quot; and &quot;Twice As Hard&quot; broke into the Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively reaching the first, eleven and fifth position. By the end of the year, &quot;Shake Your Money Maker&quot; had sold one million copies and eventually sold two million more, thus receiving triple platinum certification.

In 1991, &quot;She Talks to Angels&quot; and &quot;Seeing Things&quot; respectively reached the first and second position of the Mainstream Rock Tracks charts.

<doc id="197948" wikidata="Q1544634" url="?curid=197948" title="USS Mississippi (BB-41)">
<text>USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; (BB-41/AG-128), the second of three members of the of battleship, was the third ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 20th state. The ship was built at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia, from her keel laying in April 1915, her launching in January 1917, and her commissioning in December that year. She was armed with a battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, and was protected by heavy armor plate, with her main belt armor being thick.

The ship remained in North American waters during World War I, conducting training exercises to work up the crew. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the ship served in the Pacific Fleet. In May 1941, with World War II and the Battle of the Atlantic raging, &quot;Mississippi&quot; and her two sister ships were transferred to the Atlantic Fleet to help protect American shipping through the Neutrality Patrols. Two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Mississippi&quot; departed the Atlantic to return to the Pacific Fleet; throughout her participation in World War II, she supported amphibious operations in the Pacific. She shelled Japanese forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Philippines campaigns and the invasions of Peleliu and Okinawa. The Japanese fleet attacked American forces during the Philippines campaign, and in the ensuing Battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Mississippi&quot; took part in the Battle of Surigao Strait, the last battleship engagement in history.

After the war, &quot;Mississippi&quot; was converted into a gunnery training ship, and was also used to test new weapons systems. These included the RIM-2 Terrier missile and the AUM-N-2 Petrel missile. She was eventually decommissioned in 1956 and sold to ship breakers in November that year.

==Design==
&quot;Mississippi&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. The ship was powered by four-shaft Curtis turbines and nine oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers rated at , generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her crew numbered 1,081 officers and enlisted men. As built, she was fitted with two lattice masts with spotting tops for the main gun battery. The main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. The conning tower had thick sides.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve /50-caliber guns in four, three-gun turrets on the centerline, placed in two superfiring pairs forward and aft of the superstructure. Unlike earlier American battleships with triple turrets, these mounts were true three-gun barrels, in that each barrel could elevate independently. The secondary battery consisted of fourteen /51-caliber guns mounted in individual casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. Initially, the ship was to have been fitted with twenty-two of the guns, but experiences in the North Sea during World War I demonstrated that the additional guns, which would have been placed in the hull, would have been unusable in anything but calm seas. As a result, the casemates were plated over to prevent flooding. The secondary battery was augmented with four /50-caliber guns. In addition to her gun armament, &quot;Mississippi&quot; was also fitted with two torpedo tubes, mounted submerged in the hull, one on each broadside.

===Modifications===
&quot;Mississippi&quot; was heavily modernized in the early 1930s. Her original turbines were replaced with new geared models manufactured by Westinghouse, and she received six express boilers designed by the Bureau of Engineering. This improved her performance to a top speed of from . Her armament was also revised, with the main battery turrets being modified to allow elevation to 30 degrees, greatly extending the range of the guns. Two of the 5-inch guns were removed, and eight 5-inch/25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed. She received an additional armored deck, and her underwater protection was improved. Both lattice masts were removed; a heavy tower bridge was built in place of the fore mast, and a light pole mast was erected in place of the main mast. These alterations greatly increased her displacement, to standard and full load. Her crew increased significantly, to 1,443.

In early 1945, while under repair for combat damage, &quot;Mississippi&quot; received a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight more of the 25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns. To compensate for the added weight, the ship&#x27;s armored conning tower was removed.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Mississippi&quot; was laid down on 5 April 1915 at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 25 January 1917, and after completing fitting-out work, was commissioned into the US Navy on 18 December 1917. Then-Captain Joseph Lee Jayne served as the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. After completing sea trials off Virginia, &quot;Mississippi&quot; departed the United States on 22 March 1918 for the Gulf of Guacanayabo in Cuba, where she conducted further training. From 1919 to 1921, William A. Moffett served as the ship&#x27;s commander. On 31 January 1919, she left for another round of training in the Caribbean. Before the start of fleet maneuvers in March, &quot;Mississippi&quot; had a flying-off platform built atop her forward superfiring turret, and during the maneuvers that year, she operated a Hanriot HD.1. The ship launched the aircraft three times during the maneuvers, but as she had no landing facilities, the pilot had to land ashore and then be loaded back onto the platform. Later in the year, she returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she began a cruise between Boston and New York.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; was then reassigned to the Pacific Fleet and she accordingly left the east coast on 19 July. Throughout the 1920s, the ship routinely returned to the Caribbean for winter training exercises. Two of the original fourteen 5-inch/51-caliber guns were removed in 1922. During Fleet Problem I, held in February 1923, &quot;Mississippi&quot; sank the old pre-dreadnought &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; (formerly ), battering her first with her 5-inch guns at ranges between before firing a salvo of 14-inch shells that struck &quot;Coast Battleship No. 4&quot; amidships and inflicted fatal damage. During the gunnery exercise, spotter aircraft were used for the first time to help direct an American battleship&#x27;s guns in a major exercise.

While conducting gunnery practice off San Pedro on 12 June 1924, there was an explosion in her forward superfiring Gun Turret No. 2. The resulting fire asphyxiated 44 members of the turret crew. Upon returning to port the gunpowder that was still in Gun No. 5, the remaining gun in the turret, exploded and killed four members of the rescue team. The shell that was in the gun narrowly missed the passenger ship &quot;Yale&quot;. This was, at the time, the deadliest peace-time disaster in the Navy&#x27;s history.

She left San Francisco on 15 April 1925 for war games held off Hawaii, after which she went on a cruise to Australia, returning to California on 26 September. The ship returned to the east coast in early 1931 for a major modernization at Norfolk Navy Yard that began on 30 March. This overhaul significantly changed the ship&#x27;s profile by removing the original fore and aft lattice mast. The former was replaced with a tower. Modernization also included replacement of earlier 3-inch/50 cal anti-aircraft guns with eight 5-inch/25-caliber guns. Further training exercises followed in September 1933. On 24 October 1934, she passed through the Panama Canal on her way back to the Pacific Fleet, where she remained through mid-1941, apart from the normal winter cruises in the Caribbean.

By this time, World War II had broken out in Europe, spawning the Battle of the Atlantic. In response, President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the Neutrality Patrols to protect American shipping. On 7 May 1941, Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations, transferred &quot;Mississippi&quot;, the battleships and , the aircraft carrier , four light cruisers, and two destroyer squadrons to the Atlantic to reinforce the Neutrality Patrols. On 15 June, &quot;Mississippi&quot; arrived back in Norfolk, where she prepared to make her first patrol in the North Atlantic, which consisted of escorting a convoy from Newport, Rhode Island, to Hvalfjordur, Iceland. She began another convoy escort mission on 28 September, also to Iceland. &quot;Mississippi&quot; remained there through November to protect American shipping in the area. During this period, she was assigned to the &quot;White Patrol&quot;, a special task group, along with the other two battleships and a pair of heavy cruisers.

=== World War II ===
On 9 December, two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Mississippi&quot; departed Iceland, bound for the Pacific Theater. She reached San Francisco on 22 January 1942, where she conducted training and escorted convoys along the west coast over the following seven months. Beginning in May 1942, the original 5-inch/51-caliber guns of the secondary battery were removed to make room for anti-aircraft machine guns. On 6 December, she escorted a convoy of troop ships to Fiji, returning to Pearl Harbor on 2 March 1943. Her first major combat operation began on 10 May, when she left Hawaii to support the liberation of the Aleutian Islands. She bombarded Kiska on 22 July, and the Japanese garrison withdrew from the island a few days later. After the conclusion of the campaign, &quot;Mississippi&quot; returned to San Francisco for an overhaul. On 19 October, she left San Pedro to join the invasion fleet that would attack the Gilbert Islands. During the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign on 20 November, while &quot;Mississippi&quot; was bombarding Makin, there was again an explosion in her No. 2 turret, this time killing 43 men. After repairs, she continued on in the campaign, bombarding Kwajalein on 31 January 1944, Taroa on 20 February, and Wotje on 21 February. On 15 March, she shelled Japanese positions at Kavieng on New Ireland, before returning to the United States for an overhaul in Puget Sound. This overhaul increased the number of 5-inch/25 cal guns from eight to fourteen.

After returning to the fleet, &quot;Mississippi&quot; provided gunfire support for the Marines that went ashore at Peleliu, bombarding Japanese positions on 12 September, three days before the landing. She remained there, shelling the island for a week, before proceeding on to Manus, which had recently been taken by American forces. Assigned to the invasion fleet for the Philippines under Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf, &quot;Mississippi&quot; left Manus on 12 October and arrived off Leyte on the 19th, when she began the coastal bombardment. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, on the night of 24 October, &quot;Mississippi&quot; and the rest of the coastal bombardment battleships decisively defeated the Japanese Southern Force under Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura in the Battle of Surigao Strait. During the battle, the Japanese warships failed to detect the American vessels with their radar. Additionally, the narrow strait forced the Japanese to steam in line ahead, while &quot;Mississippi&quot; and the other battleships were stationed at the entrance, where they were able to fire full broadsides. As a result, Nishimura was unable to avoid having his &quot;T&quot; crossed. In the ensuing action, American destroyers inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese force, which was then annihilated by the concentrated fire from the battleships. &quot;Mississippi&quot;, which was equipped with older fire control radar, had trouble identifying targets in the darkness, and so fired only one 12-gun salvo, after Oldendorf had given the order to cease fire. This salvo was the last fired in the action, and proved to be the last time a battleship fired its guns at another battleship.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; remained off Leyte, providing gunfire support until 16 November, when she withdrew to the Admiralty Islands to make preparations for the next operation. On 28 December, she returned to Leyte, anchoring in San Pedro Bay. The ship began shelling Japanese positions on the island of Luzon on 6 January 1945. During the bombardment, a Japanese kamikaze struck the ship, but she remained on station, bombarding the Japanese defenses, until 10 February, when she withdrew to Pearl Harbor for repairs. She returned to service in time to join the invasion fleet that attacked Okinawa, arriving off Nakagusuku Wan on 6 May. She shelled Shuri Castle, inflicting heavy damage on a major strongpoint in the Japanese defensive line. Another kamikaze (initially identified as a friendly plane) hit the ship on 5 June, but she remained in action off Okinawa until 16 June. In July 1945 she had repairs done in , a floating repair dry dock. After the Japanese government announced it would surrender, &quot;Mississippi&quot; steamed to Sagami Wan, Honshū, as part of the occupation force, arriving there on 27 August. She was present during the signing of the surrender documents on 2 September in Tokyo Bay. Four days later, she left Japanese waters, bound for the United States. She reached Norfolk on 27 November.

===Postwar career===
Upon arriving in Norfolk, the ship was converted into a gunnery training ship, and was assigned the hull number AG-128 on 15 February 1946. In some references her hull number is given as EAG-128. The initially planned armament as a training ship differed somewhat from that actually installed. No. 1 turret was replaced by a twin 6-inch (152 mm)/47-caliber dual-purpose turret, the same as mounted on the light cruisers. No. 2 and No. 3 14-inch turrets were removed, but No. 4 turret was initially retained. Three twin 5-inch (127 mm)/38-caliber dual-purpose mounts, two single 5-inch/54-caliber dual-purpose mounts (as on the aircraft carriers), two twin 3-inch (76 mm)/50-caliber mounts, and two 40 mm Bofors quad mounts were installed. Additional weapons proposed but not equipped included two twin 5-inch/54-caliber mounts and two twin 3-inch/70-caliber mounts, but the twin 5-inch/54 mount (originally for the s) never entered service and the 3-inch/70 mount was not ready until 1956. Also, a triple 8-inch/55-caliber rapid-fire turret as on the heavy cruisers was proposed in place of No. 3 14-inch turret, but this was not equipped. It is unclear if a proposed mixed 20 mm Oerlikon battery of quadruple, twin, and single mounts was installed.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; was reconstructed at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard from November 1945 through April 1948. During the yard period she served as the flagship of the operational development force from 18 March to 15 May 1947, and as the flagship of Battleships-Cruisers Atlantic Fleet (COMBATCRULANT) from 11 June to 14 July 1947. In April 1947 she effectively replaced as an anti-aircraft training ship, with &quot;Wyoming&quot; mooring at a pier across from &quot;Mississippi&quot; and the bulk of &quot;Wyoming&quot;″s crew &quot;cross-decking&quot; to &quot;Mississippi&quot;. After emerging from the reconstruction, she served in the operational development force, carrying out gunnery tests and helping evaluate new weapon systems. The ship had two new RIM-2 Terrier missile launchers installed in 1952 with No. 4 turret removed, the work being completed on 9 August at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. The first test firings of a ship-borne Terrier missile took place on 28–29 January 1953 off Cape Cod. &quot;Mississippi&quot; later tested the Petrel missile, a radar-homing weapon, in February 1956. On 17 September, &quot;Mississippi&quot; was decommissioned at Norfolk, sold for scrap to Bethlehem Steel on 28 November, and subsequently broken up.

A single 14-inch/50-caliber gun from the ship remains and is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

<text>Soyuz 9 (, &quot;Union 9&quot;) was a June, 1970, Soviet crewed space flight. The two-man crew of Andriyan Nikolayev and Vitaly Sevastyanov broke the five-year-old space endurance record held by Gemini 7, with their nearly 18-day flight. The mission paved the way for the Salyut space station missions, investigating the effects of long-term weightlessness on crew, and evaluating the work that the cosmonauts could do in orbit, individually and as a team. It was also the last flight of the first-generation Soyuz 7K-OK spacecraft, as well as the first crewed space launch to be conducted at night. In 1970, Soyuz 9 marks the longest crewed flight by a solo spacecraft.

== Mission ==
The flight was primarily a preparatory run for the planned long duration space station missions. It tested, for a longer period of time than any other, the capacity of the hardware and the human crew, on the long-term exposure to space conditions and observing (both visually and photographically) geological and geographical objects, weather formations, water surfaces, and snow and ice covers. The crew conducted observations of celestial bodies and practiced astronavigation, by locking onto Vega or Canopus, and then used a sextant to measure its relation to the Earth horizon. The orbital elements were refined to three decimal places by the crew.

Soyuz 9 was planned to be the first manned Soviet space mission launched during nighttime hours and it had been hoped to launch it on April 22 to commemorate the centennial of Lenin&#x27;s birth but the mission took two more months to be ready. LC-1 was off-line for a year from October 1969 to October &#x27;70 as the pad was being renovated to be able to support Zenit reconnaissance satellite launches, so all R-7 vehicle launches from Baikonur during this time took place from LC-31. The pad sustained some damage during a Zenit launch on May 20 due to wind blowing around the rocket&#x27;s exhaust flames and burning through cabling but repairs were quickly completed. Further delays occurred when problems were found with the spacecraft&#x27;s electrical system. There was also a fault with the propellant feed system on the Blok I stage of the booster--this issue had occurred on several Zenit launches but to date not a Soyuz launch. The booster was rolled out to the pad and erected on 1 June and prelaunch preparations went smoothly. Liftoff took place at 11:00 PM Moscow time and the spacecraft was inserted into a 136x128 mile (219x206 km) orbit. The cosmonauts fired the Soyuz&#x27;s engine to enter an orbit of 132x167 miles (214x269 km). Once this had been accomplished, the Soviet state media officially announced the mission and described it as a &quot;long duration flight&quot; although the specific duration was not mentioned. Another engine burn the night of 2 June placed Soyuz 9 in a 165x153 mile (266x247 km) orbit at a 51° inclination which was considered stable enough to last for the length of the mission.

Efforts were made to make the accommodations inside Soyuz 9 comfortable for the cosmonauts&#x27; lengthy mission. They had sleeping bags inside the orbital module and a heater to prepare food with. They watched broadcasts of the 1970 World Cup on TV. A rudimentary exercise regimen was carried out so as to keep them in shape over the mission although this would prove less effective than hoped.

16 June marked fifteen days in orbit and there were concerns about the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit decaying too much by 20 June thus an engine burn would have to be conducted on 18 June to raise the orbit, but medical director E. Vorobiev argued that an extra day of flight was not necessary for medical data-gathering purposes and it would be better to land while the Soyuz still had adequate propellant reserves. Ultimately it was decided to go for the original 18 day flight plan if the propellant supply could hold out.

De-orbit and landing took place on 19 June at about 75 kilometers (46 miles) west of Karaganda. The cosmonauts were weaker than anticipated and had to be helped to the evacuation helicopter. Nikolayev momentarily became unconscious during the walk. Both developed a high fever and postflight medical examination found that their hearts had shrunk by as much as 20%. It was a week before they were able to walk unassisted. The lessons learned from Soyuz 9 were utilized in planning for the Salyut program, which was then in the developmental phase.

Commander Nikolayev and flight engineer Sevastyanov spent 18 days in space conducting various physiological and biomedical experiments on themselves, but also investigating the social implications of prolonged spaceflight. The cosmonauts spent time in two-way TV links with their families, watched matches in the 1970 FIFA World Cup, played chess with ground control, and voted in a Soviet election. The mission set a new space endurance record and marked a shift in emphasis away from spacefarers merely being able to exist in space for the duration of a long mission (such as the Apollo flights to the Moon) to being able to live in space. The mission took an unexpected physical toll on the cosmonauts; in order to conserve attitude control gas during the lengthy stay in orbit, Soyuz 9 was placed in a spin-stabilisation mode that made Nikolayev and Sevastyanov dizzy and space sick.

* Mass: 
* Perigee:

* Inclination: 51.70°
* Period: 88.59 minutes

== Chess game ==

During the mission, the two cosmonauts played a game of chess against a pair of opponents on Earth: head of cosmonauts Nikolai Kamanin and fellow cosmonaut Viktor Gorbatko. It was the first documented game played by humans while in space. It was a , with the two cosmonauts playing as White and jointly deciding each move, while the two players on Earth did likewise as Black. The set used aboard Soyuz 9 had pegs and grooves to keep the pieces in place and did not include magnets, which might have interfered with the spacecraft&#x27;s systems.

The game began as a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted, with both players castling kingside. Material was exchanged evenly throughout the game. Toward the end of the game White checked Black four times, and rapid exchange of remaining pieces ensued. At 35. Qxf6+, Black responded with the final move 35... Kg8 (the only legal move), moving the king to the flight square g8. In the final position each side had a queen and five pawns, with no passed pawns. The game concluded as a draw.

Sevastyanov was a chess enthusiast and after retiring from the cosmonaut corps served as president of the Soviet Chess Federation from 1977-86 and 1988-89.

== Return ==
The spacecraft soft-landed in the steppes of Kazakhstan, and the crew was picked up immediately. Adjusting to gravity of Earth seemed to present a minor problem for the two cosmonauts. They required help exiting the descent module and were virtually unable to walk for a few days. Nonetheless, this experience proved the importance of providing crews with exercise equipment during missions. After landing the crew spent 2 weeks in a quarantine unit originally designed for cosmonauts returning from Moon landings. At the time the Soviet press reported that this was done to protect the cosmonauts in case space travel had weakened their immune systems. However, the quarantine process was likely practice for the Soviet crewed lunar program, which at that point had not been abandoned.

<doc id="197959" wikidata="Q3551402" url="?curid=197959" title="De Montfort University">
<text>De Montfort University Leicester (DMU) is a public university in the city of Leicester, England. It was established in accordance with the Further and Higher Education Act in 1992 as a degree awarding body. The name De Montfort University was taken from Simon de Montfort, a 13th-century Earl of Leicester.

De Montfort University has approximately 27,000 full and part-time students, 3,240 staff and an annual turnover in the region of £168 million. The university is organised into four faculties: Art, Design, and Humanities (ADH); Business and Law (BAL); Health and Life Sciences (H&amp;LS); and Computing, Engineering and Media (CEM). It is a Sustainable Development Hub, focusing on Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions, an initiative by the United Nations launched in 2018. The Department for Education awarded the university an overall Silver rating in the 2023 Teaching Excellence Framework. It is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities.

==History==
===Origins===
The university&#x27;s origins are in the Leicester School of Art, established in 1870 on a voluntary basis. The school expanded in response to the changing needs of late 19th-century industry; leading to the introduction of subjects such as engineering, building and machine drawing. By 1897, it was clear the buildings being used were no longer suitable. £25,000 was raised to build &#x27;a very handsome school that would be enormous credit to the town and ... so that it would answer its purpose for the next 100 years&#x27;. The building in question is the Hawthorn Building, which today still houses the sciences; in the shape of the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences. At the time of the first phase its construction, there were 500 art students and 1,000 technical students. In 1903, a letter from His Majesty&#x27;s Inspector praised the success of the technical subjects. Increasing demand for courses prompted an extension to the Hawthorn Building in 1909. In 1919, further properties were rented. The Duchess of Atholl laid the foundation stone of Hawthorn&#x27;s new west wing in 1927; by which time the establishment was known under by the joint name of The Leicester Colleges of Art and Technology.

In 1930, the college was recognised for the external degree course in Pharmacy of the University of London, and the Pharmaceutical Chemist Diploma of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. In 1934, the University of London recognised the college as suitable for preparing students for the External Degree in Engineering, and so the courses on offer developed apace. The prospectus for 1936–37 included details of various technically based schools, including the Schools of Architecture, Building and Building Crafts, and Engineering. The fourth phase of extensions to the Hawthorn Building was completed in 1938–39. The first accommodation was secured in 1946 when three houses were purchased by the university.

More space was needed to meet the academic demand, and so in 1948, F. Bray, Under Secretary of the Ministry of Education, opened the converted Downings Warehouse. In 1966, the new Fletcher building was opened by The Queen Mother. In the same year, a white paper, &quot;A Plan for Polytechnics and Other Colleges&quot;, was published, leading to the creation of the City of Leicester Polytechnic. Under the provision of the Education Reform Act 1988, Leicester Polytechnic became a Higher Education Corporation, with Dame Anne Mueller appointed Chancellor in June 1991.

Leicester Polytechnic became De Montfort University in accordance with the Further and Higher Education Act in 1992, establishing it as a degree-awarding body in its own right. 

===Name===

The name De Montfort University was chosen in allusion to Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, a prominent figure in establishing the Parliament of England in the 13th century. Honouring Simon de Montfort has been controversial, as in 1231 he expelled the Jews from Leicester. By taking his name the university&#x27;s commitment to community values has been questioned.

===Expansion and contraction===

In the 1990s the institution aimed to become a multi-campus collegiate university covering the entire East Midlands, and as such, the university swiftly acquired other campuses. Leicester Polytechnic built a new campus in Kents Hill in Milton Keynes, across the road from the Open University – the first brand-new higher education campus built in Britain for twenty years. This took its first students in 1991 and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1992, prior to the official foundation of De Montfort University as a New University; it was branded The Polytechnic: Milton Keynes until it became De Montfort University Milton Keynes. Departments at Milton Keynes included Computer and Information Sciences, Built Environment and Business.

In 1994 De Montfort University took over the higher education activities of the Bedford College of Higher Education, while the further education section remained independent under the name Bedford College. The university absorbed the Lincolnshire College of Art in Lincoln, and the Lincolnshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture in Caythorpe, Lincolnshire in 1994; and the Riseholme Agricultural College in Riseholme, Lincolnshire and the Leicester-based Charles Frears College of Nursing and Midwifery in 1995.

Since 2000, the university&#x27;s expansionist policy has been reversed, with all outlying campuses being sold off. The Bedford campus merged with the University of Luton to form the University of Bedfordshire; the campuses in Lincolnshire were transferred to the University of Lincoln; and the Milton Keynes campus was closed in 2003, with its buildings taken over by the Open University. The institution divested itself of its last outlying site, Charles Frears (on London Road in Leicester), in 2011, when the nursing school moved to the city centre campus.

=== Present day ===
The university has approximately 27,000 full and part-time students, 3,240 staff and an annual turnover in the region of £168 million. Its campus comprises ten halls of residence offering around 3,000 university sourced rooms, and is approximately a ten-minute walk from Leicester city centre.

The proceeds from the campus sales have been ploughed back into the Leicester City Campus, which has consequently seen a large amount of development, including the construction of two new buildings and the extensive refurbishment of a third, the Edith Murphy building (formerly Bosworth House) to house the students and staff of the School of Nursing and Midwifery, previously based at Charles Frears.

The Performance Arts Centre for Excellence (PACE), funded by a £4.5 Million grant from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, was opened in 2007 by the BBC&#x27;s Creative Director Alan Yentob. A new building for the Faculty of Business and Law – the Hugh Aston building – designed by CPMG Architects opened in September 2009. The new Business and Law centre has the Magazine Square at its centre and cost £35 million.

The university&#x27;s new £8 million sports facility, named the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Leisure Centre, was opened on campus on 30 July 2012 by Vice-Chancellor Dominic Shellard.

The former John Sandford Site was renovated to a conference and events centre called The Venue@DMU. This was opened in September 2015.

A new Arts and Design building opened in the centre of the Campus in September 2016, the Vijay Patel Building (also by CPMG Architects), which is split into the Arts Tower and the Design Wing. At the same time the pedestrianised roads through the campus were turned into grassed/paved walkways.

In 2019 Vice-Chancellor Shellard resigned in advance of an Office for Students report which found serious and systematic failures in governance under his leadership.

==Campus==

The Leicester campus is close to Leicester Castle and occupies what was once a religious precinct of the castle, built by the earls and dukes of Lancaster, known as the Newarke. It is bordered by the 15th-century Magazine Gateway or Newarke Gateway and the campus contains listed buildings, including Trinity House, rebuilt in 1901 and containing part of the original 14th-century Hospital of The Annunciation building. The Hawthorn Building contains the ruins of the 1353 Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, where the body of King Richard III is said, according to early sources, to have been displayed before his burial at Greyfriars. The ruins form the centrepiece of the De Montfort University Heritage Centre, opened in March 2015. As well as the ruins, the Centre also celebrates the history of the university and contemporary student work.

The campus has seen several recent developments as part of a ten-year £200 million initiative by the university, such as the £35 million Hugh Aston Building; constructed to move students from the Faculty of Business and Law closer to the centre of the university&#x27;s infrastructure.

In 2016, the Vijay Patel Building was opened. The Vijay Patel Building is home to art and design courses and is the centrepiece of the £136 million Campus Transformation Project which aims to &quot;provide DMU with one of the finest city centre campuses in the country&quot;. The building is named after Dr Vijay Patel, who, alongside his wife, made the single largest donation by individuals in the university&#x27;s history.

===Campus Centre===

The Campus Centre offers numerous facilities for students. The building was completed in September 2003, fulfilling a number of functions and providing a wide range of services. The building is a three-floor building designed by Ellis Williams Architects, the company responsible for the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead. It was constructed on the site of the old Stibbe building, at a cost of £8.5 million and is central to the university&#x27;s &#x27;Masterplan&#x27;, which seeks to regenerate the Leicester campus environment.
It houses the De Montfort University Students&#x27; Union, comprising various societies such as Demon FM a student radio station; Demon TV; and The Demon, a student-run newspaper published fortnightly through term time. It also has a Student Night Club called Injunction with two rooms on the second floor.

The Union operates a lettings agency in a joint venture with the University of Leicester Students Union. The service which operates from both campuses is known as SULETS.

===Library and Learning Services===
The four Library sites on campus consist of the main Kimberlin Library and three ancillaries. Many Library functions are also available off campus at any time, including electronic resources such as academic databases, and online account management facilities such as book renewal.

The Kimberlin Library is a four-storey building opened in 1977, extended in 1997 and extensively refurbished in 2007. The ground floor Learning Zone was opened as part of the 2007 refurbishment and provides space for group and individual work. Kimberlin Library has an overall seating capacity of around 1250. The upper floors of the library cater for more traditional Quiet and Silent study needs. Further investment in 2011 saw the opening of the library Archives and Special Collections rooms and a dedicated Research Postgraduate Study Room. There are also facilities including dedicated study rooms for students with disabilities and special needs.

The Eric Wood Learning Zone is in the ground floor of the adjacent Eric Wood Building, was extended and developed into a second Learning Zone, providing 180 more study places. This was opened on 12 January 2009.

The Law Library is situated in the Hugh Aston Building which opened in September 2009, Leicester Law School is one of only a few in the country to have a dedicated Law Library on site within the teaching building . One room within this library houses the separate Legal Practice Course library, to which only students on that course have access.

==Organisation and governance==

===Faculty of Art, Design and Humanities===
Created from a merger of the previous Faculty of Art and Design and the Faculty of Humanities, the Faculty of Art, Design and Humanities offers traditional humanities subjects including English and History, as well as more design based courses in areas such as Architecture and Fine Art.

Within its humanities division, the Faculty currently holds five National Teacher Fellows; the latest being Deborah Cartmell, Reader in English, who was made a Fellow in recognition of excellence in teaching and learning support. Cartmell developed the university&#x27;s pioneering Master&#x27;s degree in Adaptation Studies and is a founding member of the British Shakespeare Association and the Association of Adaptation Studies.

Subjects of the humanities are taught within the Clephan Building, which was refurbished specifically for the Faculty&#x27;s use. The Clephan Building plays host to the Cultural Exchanges event, which features guests and speakers from the arts, media, literature, politics and film. It began in 2000, and attracts upwards of 4,000 visitors annually. Recent visitors to the festival have included the screenwriter and novelist Andrew Davies, famous for his work in the field of adaptation; novelist Adele Parks, a highly acclaimed women&#x27;s fiction author nominated for the Romantic Novelist of the Year award; and Janet Street-Porter, a British media personality, journalist, television presenter and producer.

Recently, the Faculty has collaborated with two other European universities to offer a new Master&#x27;s course, based in its International Centre for Sports History and Culture: the MA Management, Law and Humanities of Sport. Organised by Centre International d&#x27;Etude du Sport (CIES) and endorsed by FIFA, the course was created to promote management education within the sports world. It is ostensibly recognised as one of the top graduate programmes in sport, The Humanities of Sport module is organised by the International Centre for Sport History and Culture at De Montfort, whilst the Management of Sport module is taught by SDA Bocconi School of Management in Italy and the final Sports Law module by Université de Neuchâtel in Switzerland. Course patrons have included Joseph S. Blatter, Lord Coe, Sir Bobby Charlton and Sergey Bubka. As of 2010, the course has produced more than 200 graduates from over 70 different nations.

The Faculty boasts the only university courses in the world to specialise in lingerie, underwear, body-wear, swimwear and performance sportswear, which first began after the Second World War. The Faculty also offers the only UK university courses in Footwear Design.

===Faculty of Business and Law===
The Faculty of Business and Law incorporates the Leicester Castle Business School and the Leicester De Montfort Law School. The Faculty has a long history of international partnerships; in 1997, it collaborated to help found a business school in India – the Daly College Business School.

The Leicester Business School was regarded by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as one of the top 10 business schools in the UK, whilst the 2007 National Student Survey ranked it seventh out of 110 institutions for student satisfaction.

It comprises more than 4000 students and 150 academic staff, making it one of the larger providers of business and management education in the UK.

The Faculty of Business and Law is based in the Hugh Aston Building; a £35 million investiture opened in March 2010. The construction of the building released the 14th-century Magazine Gateway from four lanes of traffic, allowing a tree-lined square to be created; the Magazine Square.

The building&#x27;s namesake, Hugh Aston, died in November 1558 and was a leading figure of his generation; serving at different times as Coroner, Mayor, and Member of Parliament for the borough of Leicester, as well as being one of the foremost early Tudor composers.

===Faculty of Health and Life Sciences===
The Faculty of Health and Life Science is De Montfort&#x27;s largest faculty, housing roughly 500 full-time and part-time staff, as well as approximately 8000 students. It is composed of four interconnected schools: Leicester School of Allied Health Sciences, the School of Applied Social Sciences, the Leicester School of Nursing and Midwifery and the Leicester School of Pharmacy.

The Faculty is based in the Hawthorn Building, which was previously an Arts College; boasting an art-deco turnstile and stage area which now functions as a lecture theatre. David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix were reported to have played at the venue in the 1960s. There are ancient archways visible on the lower ground floor; supposedly remnants from a monastery which occupied the site prior to the building&#x27;s construction.

The four schools interrelate so as to allow collaboration across subject boundaries in teaching, consultancy and research. Between them, the Schools cover not just laboratory sciences but Child, Adolescent and Family Therapy; Community Studies; Community and Criminal Justice; Policing Practice; Criminal Investigation with Policing; Counselling and Psychotherapy; Applied Criminology; Applied Criminology with Psychology; Biomedical Science; Medical Science; Criminology and Criminal Justice; Forensic Science; Health and Wellbeing in Society; Midwifery; Nursing (Adult, Child, Mental Health, Learning Disability); Paramedic Science; Pharmaceutical Sciences; Pharmacy; Psychology; Psychology with Criminology; Psychology with Education Studies; Social Work; and Speech and Language Therapy.

In addition, the Community and Criminal Justice Division in the School of Applied Social Sciences is one of only 3 HEI providers nationally [England and Wales] with regard to the provision of both a Foundation degree and Graduate Diploma [both are work based] in Community and Criminal Justice Degree run in association with the National Offender Management Service.

===Computing, Engineering and Media (CEM)===
Originally Faculty of Computing Sciences and Engineering, renamed on 1 October 2008. Descended via the former Leicester Polytechnic from the old Leicester College of Technology. It comprises the School of Engineering, the Leicester Media School and the School of Computing.

The main faculty building is the Queens Building, its unique design means that the building has no need for cooling as it controls the temperature through a series of vents.

===Governance===
The university is governed primarily through its 17 person Board of Governors, which is chaired by Ian Squires since January 2020.

==Reputation and rankings==

The UK Department of Education awarded the institution a Gold rating in the 2017 Teaching Excellence Framework, describing teaching as being &quot;consistently outstanding&quot; and &quot;of the highest quality found in the UK Higher Education sector&quot;. The 2014 Research Excellence Framework described roughly 60% of the University&#x27;s research activities as &quot;world-leading&quot; or &quot;internationally excellent&quot;.

Further, the University was ranked 94th in the UK for the Guardian rankings of 2018, 70th by The Complete University Guide for 2019, and 67th by The Times/Sunday Times higher education ranking.

In 2019, the first ever Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings, a global performance tables that assess universities against the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals, ranked De Montfort University 50th in the world.

==Affiliations and partnerships==
The university has special arrangements with more than 80 universities and colleges in over 25 countries, including Nanjing University situated in Jiangsu, eastern China. The two universities have launched various initiatives, including a scholarship programme for De Montfort students and doctoral study coupled with English language tuition for students from Nanjing. De Montfort&#x27;s Institute of Creative Technologies will also advise Nanjing University on a digital recreation of medieval China, following the success of the institute in developing a virtual rendition of Leicester during its Roman occupation.

<text>The SILLIAC (Sydney version of the [[ILLIAC I|]]Ill[[SILLIAC|inois ]]A[[SILLIAC|utomatic ]]C[[SILLIAC|omputer]]&quot;, i.e. the Sydney ILLIAC&quot;), an early computer built by the University of Sydney, Australia, was based on the ILLIAC and ORDVAC computers developed at the University of Illinois.

Like other early computers, SILLIAC was physically large. The computer itself was a single large cabinet 2.5 m high, 3 m wide and 0.6 m deep in one room. Its power supply occupied a second room and air conditioning required an additional room in the basement.

It ran until May 17, 1968, when it was replaced by a faster and bigger machine. Although it was then broken up, some pieces of SILLIAC are at the Powerhouse Museum and others are displayed at Sydney University.

==History==
SILLIAC had its genesis in late 1953 when Harry Messel, the dynamic new head of the School of Physics, and John Blatt, newly arrived researcher, both independently realised that the school needed an electronic computer as a tool for theoretical physics. Whilst the first computer in the southern hemisphere, the CSIR Mk 1, was already running elsewhere on the University of Sydney grounds, there were several serious impediments to its use by the School of Physics: The CSIR Mk 1 was fully occupied with CSIR research and John Blatt found its staff very unhelpful; and, as a serial architecture computer, it was far too slow for the sort of problems that Blatt and Messel envisaged. The solution was for the School to build its own computer.

Rather than design a computer from scratch, Blatt and Messel chose to copy the design of the ILLIAC for which the University of Illinois were happy to provide plans and assistance. John Algie, then maintenance engineer for CSIRAC, estimated the cost at AU£35,200, which was approximately ten times the cost of a Sydney suburban house at the time. Based on this, a decision to proceed was made at the end of 1953. A mutual friend introduced Messel to Adolph Basser, who donated AU£50,000 towards the computer. SILLIAC&#x27;s eventual cost was AU£75,000.

In July 1954, Standard Telephones and Cables was contracted to build the computer, with testing and installation performed by technicians within the School of Physics.

SILLIAC&#x27;s first scientific computation was carried out by PhD student Bob May (later Robert May, Baron May of Oxford) in June 1956, after self tests had been completed successfully. Another PhD student user in that month was John C. Butcher (later Professor of Mathematics at the University of Auckland), . Users were provided with regular access from July 9, with the official opening conducted on September 12.

Having abandoned its own computer system in 1955, CSIRO Division of Radiophysics in 1957 rented computing time on SILLIAC at a half-price rate of for 400 hours to perform analysis on data received by its equipment at Murrybank Field.

Barry de Ferranti, a pioneer involved in the construction of SILLIAC described the main cabinet of the computer as about 2 metres high, 1 metre deep and 5 metres long with glass panels at the front and light switches that indicated what was going on inside.

It ran until May 17, 1968, when it was replaced by a faster and bigger machine. SILLIAC has now been broken up into pieces with parts of it placed on display in the Chau Chak Wing Museum, which opened in November 2020.

== Hardware specifications ==
* Parallel, asynchronous operation. Approximately 13,000 adds, 1400 multiplies or 1200 divides per second
* Memory: 1024 words of 40 bits using 40 Williams tubes
* Two 20-bit instructions per word.
* Approximately 150 operations on two registers
* Paper tape input at 200 characters per second (cps), paper tape output at about 50 cps or teleprinter output at 10 cps. Four magnetic tape units added in 1958
* Initially 2768 valves. Increased to 2911 during 1958 upgrade
* Power consumption: 35 kW
* Average of 11 hours between failures

Like most of the IAS family, SILLIAC was not an exact copy of ILLIAC. One important change was the use of 2C51 valves in place of the more common 6J6. The 2C51 had been developed by Bell Labs for use in undersea telephone repeaters and had about 5 times the life (for 6 times the cost). This decision significantly improved the reliability of SILLIAC compared to its contemporaries.

== Conservation ==
Some pieces of SILLIAC are at the Powerhouse Museum and others are displayed at Sydney University.
When it had been broken up, parts had originally been given to a range of people, including 14 schoolchildren who had requested the University for mementoes.

In March 2008, the Australian Computer Museum Society was seeking alternative storage, or risked its collection, including important components of SILLIAC, being scrapped.

In 2023 the Australian Computer Museum Society now has a venue for displaying the parts of SILLIAC that are in its collection.

<text>Information goods are commodities that provide value to consumers as a result of the information it contains and refers to any good or service that can be digitalized. Examples of information goods includes books, journals, computer software, music and videos. Information goods can be copied, shared, resold or rented. Information goods are durable and thus, will not be destroyed through consumption. As information goods have distinct characteristics as they are experience goods, have returns to scale and are non-rivalrous, the laws of supply and demand that depend on the scarcity of products do not frequently apply to information goods. As a result, the buying and selling of information goods differs from ordinary goods. Information goods are goods whose unit production costs (including distribution costs) are negligible compared to their amortized development costs. Well-informed companies have development costs that increase with product quality, but their unit cost is zero. Once an information commodity has been developed, other units can be produced and distributed at almost zero cost. For example, allow downloads over the Internet. Conversely, for industrial goods, the unit cost of production and distribution usually dominates. Firms with an industrial advantage do not incur any development costs, but unit costs increase as product quality improves.

== Common Trading Models ==
There are two common trading methods in information goods trading. Leasing model and selling model. Providers of information goods and services are increasingly adopting leasing models.

Leasing model: The user does not own it permanently but leases the information good or service from the provider and pays a fixed fee on a regular basis. For example, mobile music applications. Consumers pay monthly for listening rights to all songs on the platform.

Selling model: After prepaid, consumers can use it unlimited times. For example, games from game companies. Consumers can play the game regardless of the time and number of times after purchasing a game disc or network license.

== Disadvantages of Information Goods ==
Piracy is one of the most important issues facing information service providers today. A report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office states that counterfeiting and piracy have a wide-ranging impact on consumers, industries, governments and the economy. Generally, it depends on the type of infringement involved and other factors. These include lost sales, lost tax revenue, damaged brand value, and reduced incentives to innovate. For example, the software industry may be one of the hardest hit. In 2011, the piracy rate of US software products was about 20%. That alone cost the American software maker a whopping $9.5 million in lost revenue.

In addition, social sharing of information goods involves buying and sharing a single good through a network of acquaintances such as friends or colleagues is also an important issue for suppliers of these goods. When customers buy an information good and send it to their friends or colleagues. The person who receives it does not need to buy it again. Although these actions do not involve piracy, it affects the sale of information goods.

== Bundling Strategy ==
Although information goods can be copied in large numbers and sold after completion. But it can also be shared by customers who have already purchased it. Despite the growth of the Internet, the profits of information products will only decrease. As a result, producers started bundling. Bakos &amp; Brynjolfsson (1999) found that Bundling large numbers of unrelated information goods can be surprisingly profitable because the law of large numbers makes it much easier to predict the value consumers place on bundled goods than if they were sold individually.
== Versioning Strategy ==
Versioning is a method of implementing second-degree price discrimination through varying the quality of a product. This approach is particularly advantageous when it is not costly to downgrade an information good to create one or more lower quality versions versioning involves a corporation offering its product in various versions and allowing customers to choose the one that suits them best. The goal for the corporation is to minimize expenses while meeting customer requirements as precisely as possible and matching the requested price to customers&#x27; willingness to pay. For information goods providers, producing different versions is relatively easy and cost-effective, especially for established products like a mail program or a communications portal. However, it&#x27;s important to determine how many versions to offer. While it&#x27;s theoretically possible to produce an individual version for each customer at a low versioning cost and achieve complete price discrimination, having too many product versions can be confusing for customers. The market should be able to easily distinguish between the performance differences of the versions to make informed purchasing decisions The best way to version information goods depends heavily on their network externalities. However, even for products that have significant externalities, the decision to version should also consider other factors such as how exclusive the network is and the costs involved in versioning Typically, vendors in proprietary networks benefit more from versioning than those in shared networks. For products that follow open standards or are compatible with other competing brands, vendors may consider reducing their versioning activities as it may not produce the desired benefits.

== Economic theory ==
Information economics refers to a microeconomic theory that studies how information affects economic activities. An information marketplace differs from the market place of ordinary goods as information goods are not actually consumed and can be reproduced and distributed at a very low marginal cost. The unique characteristics of information goods complicate many standard economic theories.

Economic theories on information goods face the problem of dealing with two contradictory concepts. On one hand, information is regarded as an important economic resource for development as perfect information is a key requirement of the efficient-market hypothesis. As a result, complete information should be accessible and made available to everyone at no cost. However, actual markets often depend on information as a commodity, resulting in information goods. If information is a commodity, it will be potentially restricted in terms of access, cost, availability and completeness and thus, not be freely available.

==Market failure==
Information goods have a number of characteristics that contribute to market failure. Information goods have very high fixed costs of production but can be reproduced with zero or very low marginal cost which can cause difficulties in competitive markets. Improvements in digital technology have also allowed information goods to be easily reproduced and distributed. For example, it can cost over a hundred million dollars to produce a movie, while the movie can easily be recorded in the cinema or online and distributed inexpensively. Furthermore, information goods typically incur sunk costs which are not recoverable. While there are copyright and piracy laws making it illegal for consumers to copy and distribute information goods, it is often difficult to detect copying and distributing activities which makes it hard for authorities to prevent the illegal distribution of information goods.

As information goods are experience goods, consumers may be reluctant to purchase them as they are unable to accurately assess the utility they would gain from the good before purchasing it. As a result, information goods can suffer from adverse selection and result in a type of market failure known as the lemon problem, which is where the quality of the goods traded in the market can decrease due to asymmetric information between a buyer and seller.

Information goods are also public goods meaning that they are non-rival and sometimes non-excludable. This is because one person’s consumption of an information good does not reduce other people’s enjoyment of the same good or diminish the amount available to other people. Additionally, a person generally cannot exclude others from consuming an information good.

==Methods to overcome market failure==
Producers of information goods can engage in a number of strategies to address the market failure that arises. In order to address the market failure that arises as a result of information goods being experience goods, producers can provide consumers with previews so that they can partially experience the good prior to purchasing it. For example, movie producers will often release a movie trailer and synopsis so that consumers know what the movie is about before they watch it which influences their likelihood of purchasing the good. Another way producers of information goods overcome the experience good problem is through reviews. By reading reviews and testimonials on information goods, consumers can determine the quality of an information good and know what it is before purchasing it. Additionally, to prevent market failure, producers can establish and maintain their brand reputation. This is because if an information good has a well-established brand reputation, consumers will be inclined to purchase it even if they are unable to determine how much satisfaction they will gain from the good before experiencing it.

In order to prevent consumers from copying and distributing information goods, copyright and piracy laws make it illegal for consumers to copy and reproduce goods that they did not produce. Laws and regulations address the market failure that occurs due to information goods having returns to scale by imposing penalties on individuals who illegally reproduce information goods which prevents them from doing so.

<text>The electron affinity (&quot;E&quot;ea) of an atom or molecule is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron attaches to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form an anion.
::X(g) + e− → X−(g) + energy
This differs by sign from the energy change of electron capture ionization. The electron affinity is positive when energy is released on electron capture.

In solid state physics, the electron affinity for a surface is defined somewhat differently (see below).

== Measurement and use of electron affinity ==

This property is used to measure atoms and molecules in the gaseous state only, since in a solid or liquid state their energy levels would be changed by contact with other atoms or molecules.

A list of the electron affinities was used by Robert S. Mulliken to develop an electronegativity scale for atoms, equal to the average of the electrons
affinity and ionization potential. Other theoretical concepts that use electron affinity include electronic chemical potential and chemical hardness. Another example, a molecule or atom that has a more positive value of electron affinity than another is often called an electron acceptor and the less positive an electron donor. Together they may undergo charge-transfer reactions.

=== Sign convention ===
To use electron affinities properly, it is essential to keep track of sign. For any reaction that &quot;releases&quot; energy, the &quot;change&quot; Δ&quot;E&quot; in total energy has a negative value and the reaction is called an exothermic process. Electron capture for almost all non-noble gas atoms involves the release of energy and thus is exothermic. The positive values that are listed in tables of &quot;E&quot;ea are amounts or magnitudes. It is the word &quot;released&quot; within the definition &quot;energy released&quot; that supplies the negative sign to Δ&quot;E&quot;. Confusion arises in mistaking &quot;E&quot;ea for a change in energy, Δ&quot;E&quot;, in which case the positive values listed in tables would be for an endo- not exo-thermic process. The relation between the two is &quot;E&quot;ea = −Δ&quot;E&quot;(attach).

However, if the value assigned to &quot;E&quot;ea is negative, the negative sign implies a reversal of direction, and energy is &quot;required&quot; to attach an electron. In this case, the electron capture is an endothermic process and the relationship, &quot;E&quot;ea = −Δ&quot;E&quot;(attach) is still valid. Negative values typically arise for the capture of a second electron, but also for the nitrogen atom.

The usual expression for calculating &quot;E&quot;ea when an electron is attached is

This expression does follow the convention Δ&quot;X&quot; = &quot;X&quot;(final) − &quot;X&quot;(initial) since −Δ&quot;E&quot; = −(&quot;E&quot;(final) − &quot;E&quot;(initial)) = &quot;E&quot;(initial) − &quot;E&quot;(final).

Equivalently, electron affinity can also be defined as the amount of energy &quot;required&quot; to detach an electron from the atom while it holds a single-excess-electron thus making the atom a negative ion, i.e. the energy change for the process

:X− → X + e−

If the same table is employed for the forward and reverse reactions, &quot;without switching signs&quot;, care must be taken to apply the correct definition to the corresponding direction, attachment (release) or detachment (require). Since almost all detachments &quot;(require +)&quot; an amount of energy listed on the table, those detachment reactions are endothermic, or Δ&quot;E&quot;(detach) &gt; 0.

== Electron affinities of the elements ==
Although &quot;E&quot;ea varies greatly across the periodic table, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive &quot;E&quot;ea than metals. Atoms whose anions are more stable than neutral atoms have a greater &quot;E&quot;ea. Chlorine most strongly attracts extra electrons; neon most weakly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been conclusively measured, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.

&quot;E&quot;ea generally increases across a period (row) in the periodic table prior to reaching group 18. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a group 17 atom releases more energy than a group 1 atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled valence shell and therefore is more stable. In group 18, the valence shell is full, meaning that added electrons are unstable, tending to be ejected very quickly.

Counterintuitively, &quot;E&quot;ea does &quot;not&quot; decrease when progressing down most columns of the periodic table. For example, &quot;E&quot;ea actually increases consistently on descending the column for the group 2 data. Thus, electron affinity follows the same &quot;left-right&quot; trend as electronegativity, but not the &quot;up-down&quot; trend.

The following data are quoted in kJ/mol.

== Molecular electron affinities ==
The electron affinity of molecules is a complicated function of their electronic structure.
For instance the electron affinity for benzene is negative, as is that of naphthalene, while those of anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene are positive. &quot;In silico&quot; experiments show that the electron affinity of hexacyanobenzene surpasses that of fullerene.

== &quot;Electron affinity&quot; as defined in solid state physics ==

In the field of solid state physics, the electron affinity is defined differently than in chemistry and atomic physics. For a semiconductor-vacuum interface (that is, the surface of a semiconductor), electron affinity, typically denoted by &quot;E&quot;EA or &quot;χ&quot;, is defined as the energy obtained by moving an electron from the vacuum just outside the semiconductor to the bottom of the conduction band just inside the semiconductor:
:formula_1
In an intrinsic semiconductor at absolute zero, this concept is functionally analogous to the chemistry definition of electron affinity, since an added electron will spontaneously go to the bottom of the conduction band. At nonzero temperature, and for other materials (metals, semimetals, heavily doped semiconductors), the analogy does not hold since an added electron will instead go to the Fermi level on average. In any case, the value of the electron affinity of a solid substance is very different from the chemistry and atomic physics electron affinity value for an atom of the same substance in gas phase. For example, a silicon crystal surface has electron affinity 4.05 eV, whereas an isolated silicon atom has electron affinity 1.39 eV.

The electron affinity of a surface is closely related to, but distinct from, its work function. The work function is the thermodynamic work that can be obtained by reversibly and isothermally removing an electron from the material to vacuum; this thermodynamic electron goes to the &quot;Fermi level&quot; on average, not the conduction band edge: formula_2. While the work function of a semiconductor can be changed by doping, the electron affinity ideally does not change with doping and so it is closer to being a material constant. However, like work function the electron affinity does depend on the surface termination (crystal face, surface chemistry, etc.) and is strictly a surface property.

In semiconductor physics, the primary use of the electron affinity is not actually in the analysis of semiconductor–vacuum surfaces, but rather in heuristic electron affinity rules for estimating the band bending that occurs at the interface of two materials, in particular metal–semiconductor junctions and semiconductor heterojunctions.

In certain circumstances, the electron affinity may become negative. Often negative electron affinity is desired to obtain efficient cathodes that can supply electrons to the vacuum with little energy loss. The observed electron yield as a function of various parameters such as bias voltage or illumination conditions can be used to describe these structures with band diagrams in which the electron affinity is one parameter. For one illustration of the apparent effect of surface termination on electron emission, see Figure 3 in Marchywka Effect.

<doc id="197967" wikidata="Q57454" url="?curid=197967" title="Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein">
<text>Hans-Adam II (Johannes Adam Ferdinand Alois Josef Maria Marco d&#x27;Aviano Pius; born 14 February 1945) is the Prince of Liechtenstein. He is the son of Prince Franz Joseph II and his wife, Countess Georgina von Wilczek. He also bears the titles Duke of Troppau and Jägerndorf, and Count of Rietberg. Under his reign, a 2003 constitutional referendum expanded the powers of the Prince of Liechtenstein. In 2004, Hans-Adam transferred day-to-day governmental duties to his eldest son Hereditary Prince Alois as regent, like his father had granted him in 1984 to prepare him for the role.

==Early life==

He was born on 14 February 1945 in Zürich, Switzerland, as the eldest son of Prince Franz Joseph II and Princess Gina of Liechtenstein, with his godfather being Pope Pius XII. His father had succeeded as Prince of Liechtenstein in 1938 upon the death of his childless grand-uncle, Prince Franz I, and Hans-Adam was thus hereditary prince from birth.

In 1956, he entered the Schottengymnasium in Vienna. In 1960, he transferred to the Lyceum Alpinium Zuoz in Switzerland, earning a Swiss Matura and a German Abitur in 1965. He then worked as a bank trainee in London before enrolling at the University of St. Gallen to study business administration, graduating with a licentiate in 1969. He is fluent in English and French in addition to his native German.

In 1984, Prince Franz Joseph II, while legally remaining head of state and retaining the title of sovereign prince, formally handed the power of making day-to-day governmental decisions to his eldest son as a way of beginning a dynastic transition to a new generation. Hans-Adam formally succeeded as Prince of Liechtenstein upon the death of his father on 13 November 1989.

==Powers==
A referendum to adopt Hans-Adam&#x27;s revision of the Constitution of Liechtenstein to expand his powers passed in 2003. The prince had threatened to abdicate and leave the country if the referendum did not result in his favour.

On August 15, 2004, Hans-Adam formally handed the power of making day-to-day governmental decisions to his eldest son Hereditary Prince Alois as regent, as a way of beginning a dynastic transition to a new generation. Legally, Hans-Adam remains the head of state. Hans-Adam&#x27;s father Franz Joseph II had similarly done so for him on 26 August 1984.

In a July 2012 referendum, the people of Liechtenstein overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to curtail the political power of the princely family. A few days before the vote, Hereditary Prince Alois announced he would veto any relaxing of the ban on abortion, also up for referendum. 76 per cent of those voting in the first referendum supported Alois&#x27; power to veto the outcome of future referendums. Legislators, who serve on a part-time basis, rose in the hereditary prince&#x27;s defence on 23 May, voting 18 to 7 against the citizens&#x27; initiative.

==Viewpoints and controversies==
Throughout his reign, Hans-Adam has been a prominent proponent of strengthening Liechtenstein&#x27;s economic and political independence from Switzerland, of which the two countries have been in a customs union since 1924. In a speech from 1970 nicknamed the &quot;backpack speech&quot;, Hans-Adam declared his intentions to push for an independent Liechtenstein foreign policy. He was a major proponent of Liechtenstein joining the United Nations, which the country successfully did so in 1990.

Hans-Adam instigated the 1992 Liechtenstein constitutional crisis by calling for a referendum regarding Liechtenstein&#x27;s accession to the European Economic Area to be held in advance of the corresponding one in Switzerland, against the wishes of both the government and the Landtag of Liechtenstein. On 28 October 1992, he threatened to dissolve the Landtag and dismiss the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, Hans Brunhart, over the dispute and appoint an acting prime minister in his place. In response, approximately 2,000 people demonstrated in front of the government house in Vaduz. On the same day, the government and Hans-Adam II negotiated and came to an agreement that scheduled the referendum after the corresponding one in Switzerland, though notably it affirmed that Liechtenstein would commit to agreements with the EEA despite the result in Switzerland. The event forced the customs union between Liechtenstein and Switzerland to be revised to grant Liechtenstein greater freedom in deciding its foreign policy, and Liechtenstein subsequently joined the EEA in 1995.

In 1995, Hans-Adam was the subject of a complaint to the European Convention on Human Rights against the state of Liechtenstein for the violation of freedom of speech and right to an effective remedy. This was promoted by Hans-Adam sending a letter to former Deputy Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, Herbert Wille, which stated that he would not appoint Willie to a public office due to him expressing the opinion in a speech that the Liechtenstein state court should hold the final say over the prince regarding disputes with the constitution of Liechtenstein. In 1999, the ECHR ruled that a violation had taken place and the state of Liechtenstein was convicted.

In an interview with Radio Liechtenstein in February 2021, Prince Hans-Adam II expressed his support for same-sex marriage but said he opposed allowing same-sex couples to adopt.

=== Books ===
Hans-Adam has written the political treatise &quot;The State in the Third Millennium&quot; (), which was published in late 2009. In it, he argues for the continued importance of the nation-state as a political actor. He makes the case for democracy as the best form of government, which he sees China and Russia as in transition towards, although the path will be difficult for these nations. He also declared his role in a princely family as something that has legitimacy only from the assent of the people. He stated that government should be limited to a small set of tasks and abilities, writing that people &quot;have to free the state from all the unnecessary tasks and burdens with which it has been loaded during the last hundred years, which have distracted it from its two main tasks: maintenance of the rule of law and foreign policy&quot;. Hans-Adam is a friend of the German anarcho-capitalist economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe.

Hans-Adam wrote to the foreword to a &quot;Sourcebook, on Self-Determination and Self-Administration&quot;, which was edited by Wolfgang F. Danspeckgruber and Arthur Watts (, 1997), and in the &quot;Encyclopedia Princetoniensis&quot;.

=== Interest in UFO research ===
Hans-Adam has financed research into UFOs for decades and is said to have a great personal interest in ufology. This became public through the diaries of the well-known ufologist and astronomer Jacques Vallée, whom Hans-Adam had invited to his castle. He also worked with the American businessman Robert Bigelow, who has also financed UFO research. Hans-Adam&#x27;s interest in the phenomenon is said to have been sparked by a UFO sighting by his aunt in Munich in the 1950s.

==Entrepreneurship and personal wealth==
Before his accession to the throne, he transformed LGT Bank which is wholly owned by his family, from a small local bank into an internationally operating financial group. As of 2003 he had a family fortune of US$7.6 billion and a personal fortune of about US$4 billion, making him one of the world&#x27;s richest heads of state, and Europe&#x27;s wealthiest monarch.

He inherited his main residence, Vaduz Castle in Liechtenstein, furthermore in Austria Liechtenstein Castle, Wilfersdorf Castle (with a wine farm), the Liechtenstein Garden Palace and the Liechtenstein City Palace in Vienna. In addition to real estate, viticulture, agriculture and forestry, the prince owns a number of companies, the most important being the American company RiceTec.

He also inherited an extensive art collection, much of which is displayed for the public at the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. As of July 2022, his net worth was estimated by &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; around US$6.20 billion, making him the 380th richest person on earth. However, he placed these assets in a family foundation, the Prince of Liechtenstein Foundation, from which each family member receives an equal annual allowance and which maintains the family&#x27;s castles, cultural assets, collections and museums and last but not least, the costs of the princely court including even some salaries for princes who are ambassadors abroad, which are not a burden on the taxpayer.

His successful entrepreneurship allowed him to buy back parts of the family art collection which his father had to sell after World War II due to lack of money after his vast land holdings in Czechoslovakia had been expropriated (measuring 7.5 times the total area of the Principality itself) and after his Austrian properties had become inaccessible until the end of the Soviet occupation in 1955. In addition, he continues to expand the collection of classical paintings and applied arts to this day.

==Personal life==

<doc id="197970" wikidata="Q17453" url="?curid=197970" title="Œ">
<text>Œ (minuscule: œ) is a Latin alphabet grapheme, a ligature of &quot;o&quot; and &quot;e&quot;. In medieval and early modern Latin, it was used in borrowings from Greek that originally contained the diphthong &quot;οι&quot;, and in a few non-Greek words. These usages continue in English and French. In French, the words that were borrowed from Latin and contained the Latin diphthong written as &quot;œ&quot; now generally have &quot;é&quot; or &quot;è&quot;; but &quot;œ&quot; is still used in some non-learned French words, representing open-mid front rounded vowels, such as &quot;œil&quot; (&quot;eye&quot;) and &quot;sœur&quot; (&quot;sister&quot;).

It is used in the modern orthography for Old West Norse and is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet to represent the open-mid front rounded vowel. In English runology, &quot;œ ɶ&quot; is used to transliterate the rune othala (Old English &#x27; &quot;estate, ancestral home&quot;). Its traditional name in English isethelorœthel(also spelt,ēðel,odal).

==Latin==
Classical Latin wrote the &quot;o&quot; and &quot;e&quot; separately (as has today again become the general practice), but the ligature was used by medieval and early modern writings, in part because the diphthongal sound had, by Late Latin, merged into the sound . The classical diphthong had the value , similar to (standard) English oi as in &quot;choice&quot;. It occurs most often in borrowings from Greek, rendering that language&#x27;s &quot;οι&quot; (in majuscule &quot;ΟΙ&quot;), although it is also used in some native words such as &quot;coepi&quot; &quot;I began&quot;.

==French==
In French, &quot;œ&quot; is called &#x27; , which means &quot;e in the o&quot; (a mnemotechnic pun used first at school, sounding like &#x27;, meaning &quot;eggs in water&quot;) or sometimes &#x27;, (literally &quot;o and e glued&quot;) and is a true linguistic ligature, not just a typographic one (like the &quot;fi&quot; or &quot;fl&quot; ligatures), reflecting etymology. In Canadian French, the names &quot;o-e liés&quot; (&quot;linked O and E&quot;) or &quot;lettre double œ&quot; (where O and E are pronounced separately for clarity) are used officially. &quot;Œ&quot; is most prominent in the words &#x27; (&quot;mores&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;heart&quot;), &quot;chœur&quot; (&quot;choir&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;sister&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;egg&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;beef&quot;, &quot;steer&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;work&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;eye&quot;), in which the digraph &quot;œu&quot;, like &quot;eu&quot;, represents the sound (in other cases, like plurals &#x27; (&quot;eggs&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;steers&quot;), it stands for ).

French also uses &quot;œ&quot; in direct borrowings from Latin and Greek. So, &quot;coeliac&quot; in French is &#x27;, &quot;fetus / foetus&quot; is &quot;fœtus&quot; and &quot;Oedipus&quot; is &quot;Œdipe&quot;. In such cases, the &quot;œ&quot; is classically pronounced , or, sometimes, in modern pronunciation, . In some words, like &#x27; and &quot;&quot;, the etymological &quot;œ&quot; is changed to a more French &quot;é&quot;.

In French placenames or family names of Germanic origin (mostly in and around Alsace-Lorraine, historically Germanic-speaking areas that have changed hands between France and Germany (or Prussia before 1871) a number of times), &quot;œ&quot; replaces German &quot;ö&quot; and is pronounced . Examples include Schœneck (Moselle), Kœtzingue (Haut-Rhin), and Hœrdt (Bas-Rhin) for placenames, or Schœlcher (as in Victor Schœlcher) for surnames.

In all cases, &quot;œ&quot; is alphabetized as &quot;oe&quot;, rather than as a separate letter.

When occurs in French without the ligature, it is pronounced or sometimes , just like words spelt with . The most common words of this type are (&quot;stove&quot;, &quot;frying pan&quot;) and (&quot;soft&quot;). is itself an etymological spelling, with the reflecting its derivation from Latin . If the is not to be pronounced thus, then a diaeresis, acute or grave accent needs to be added in order to indicate that the vowels should be pronounced separately. For example, , , . The exception to this rule is when a morpheme ending in is joined to one beginning in , as in , or with the prefix , which is always pronounced in hiatus with the following vowel, as in (&quot;ratio&quot;, &quot;coefficient&quot;).

==Lombard==
In Lombard &quot;œ&quot; is used in many writing systems, sometimes along with &quot;u&quot;, the phoneme. For example: (bat).

==English==
A number of words written with &quot;œ&quot; were borrowed from French and from Latin into English, where the &quot;œ&quot; is now rarely written. Modern American English spelling usually substitutes &quot;œ&quot; with &quot;e&quot;, so &quot;diarrhœa&quot; has become &quot;diarrhea&quot;, although there are some exceptions, such as &quot;phoenix&quot;. In modern British English, the spellings generally keep the &quot;o&quot; but remove the ligature (e.g. &quot;diarrhoea&quot;).

The &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; is traditionally pronounced as &quot;short Ĕ&quot; , as &quot;long Ē&quot; , or as an (unrounded) unstressed vowel. These three Modern-English values interchange with one another in consistent ways, just as do the values within each of the sets from the other vowel-spellings that at the Middle English stage likewise represented non-diphthongs — except for, as was recognised particularly in certain positions by Dobson a tendency whereby
: &quot;... long vowels are, in later use, often substituted ... cf. Pres(ent-Day) E(nglish) [iːkənɒmik] &#x27;economic&#x27; in place of the popular [ekənɒmik], which (latter) is in accord with the normal rules and must be regarded as the traditional and naturally-developed pronunciation ...&quot;.

There are a few words that English has recently borrowed from contemporary French. The pronunciation of these English words is generally an approximation to that of the French word (the French use or in terms of the International Phonetic Alphabet). English-speakers use a variety of substitutions for these sounds. The words involved include , , , and .

However, most &quot;œ&quot; words use the traditional English pronunciation of borrowings from/via pre-modern French and from/via Latin. Examples are listed in the following categories, into which they have been divided by developments in our pronunciation since Middle English.

* An overriding rule is that where &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; is followed by another vowel (whatever the position(s) of stress(es) in the word), it is pronounced as a long Ē ().

:Examples: &quot;onomatopœic&quot;, &quot;onomatopœia&quot;, &quot;dyspnœa&quot;, &quot;apnœa&quot;, &quot;amenorrhœa&quot;, &quot;diarrhœa&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Eubœa&quot;, &quot;Bœotia&quot;, &quot;homœosis&quot;, &quot;homœopathy&quot;; &quot;homœopath&quot;; &quot;homœopathic&quot;, &quot;homœostatic&quot;, &quot;homœostasis&quot;, &quot;homœozoic&quot;, &quot;homœomorphic&quot;, and &quot;homœomorphism&quot;.

* In open syllables immediately following or preceding a syllable that bears primary or secondary stress, an &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; is pronounced as an (unrounded) unstressed vowel, as in the short Ĭ () or Schwa-like sound (). Alternatively, especially when clearer enunciation is desired, an additional (secondary) stress can be added, resulting in a long Ē ().

:Examples: &quot;tragœdy&quot;, &quot;(arch)diœcese&quot;; &quot;œconomisation&quot;, &quot;œsophageal&quot;; &quot;œsophagus&quot;, &quot;œcologist&quot;, &quot;œcology&quot;, &quot;œconomise&quot;, &quot;œconomist&quot;, &quot;œconomy&quot;, &quot;œdema&quot;, &quot;œnologist&quot;, &quot;œnology&quot;, ..., &quot;pœnology&quot;, and &quot;Phœnician&quot;.

* A long Ē () can be used for &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; in a primary stressed open syllable that lies within the final two syllables of the word (not counting suffixes such as &quot;-es&quot; and &quot;-ing&quot;, even if they are syllabic, and lexical suffixes like &quot;-cide&quot; if they do not affect the pronunciation of the rest of the word).

::Examples: &quot;subpœna(ing)&quot;, &quot;phœnix(es)&quot;, (&quot;fœticide&quot;, which belongs in this category if the first vowel is pronounced as long Ē () due to carry-over from the next word,) &quot;fœtus&quot;, &quot;Phœbe&quot;, &quot;fœtor&quot;, &quot;pœnal&quot;, &quot;Crœsus&quot;, and &quot;amœba&quot;.

* A long Ē () is used for &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; in primary-stressed open syllables that lie in the third-to-final position (antepenultimate syllables) if the final syllable begins with a vowel and the penultimate (second-to-last) ends in a vowel other than &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot; (or did prior to a blending of that vowel with the preceding consonant).

::Examples: &quot;cœliac&quot; and &quot;Mœsia(n)&quot;, which (depending on the dialect) equal and ~ ~ ~.

* Finally, there are some cases where a short Ĕ is used, as what Dobson called in the quote above the &quot;naturally-developed pronunciation&quot; though &quot;the long vowels are, in later use, often substituted&quot;:

# for an &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; lying in a secondarily-stressed (open or ) syllable not adjacent to the primary-stressed one, as in &quot;(con)fœderation&quot;, &quot;œcologic(al)(ly)&quot;, &quot;œconomic(al)(ly)&quot;, &quot;œcumenical(ly)&quot; and &quot;œstrogenic&quot;;
# for an &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; in a closed syllable anywhere as long as it bears some stress (so this overlaps with the preceding category), as in &quot;œstrogenic&quot;, &quot;œstrogen&quot;, and &quot;œstrus&quot;;
# for an &quot;œ&quot; ~ &quot;oe&quot; ~ &quot;e&quot; in a primary-stressed syllable that does not lie within the final two syllables of the word (except for words like &quot;cœliac&quot; and &quot;Mœsia(n)&quot;, see above).

::Examples: &quot;s&quot;, &quot;(con)fœderate&quot; (adj.), &quot;to (con)fœderate&quot;, &quot;(ly)&quot;, &quot;Œdipal&quot;, &quot;Œdipus&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

The likes of &quot;fœ̯tid&quot;, though superficially exceptional here, do indeed belong here in this category because the counting properly includes also final &quot;-e&quot; that has gone silent since Middle English (and therefore has been left out by some spellings) in those situations where speakers before the &quot;-e&quot;″s demise, such as Chaucer (who did not drop it in rhymes), would have had the &quot;-e&quot; as an intrinsic part of the word (rather than as just a suffix) — save for its regularly disappearing where followed with no pause by a word beginning with a vowel or sometimes .

As less-circumstantial evidence (than this word&#x27;s modern short Ĕ ) that it contained the final &quot;-e&quot;, consider both the spelling of its earliest attestation in English recorded by the &quot;NED&quot;, within &quot;It maketh to blister both handes, &amp; feet, out of which issueth &quot;foetide&quot;, and stinckinge water.&quot; (in a text dating to 1599). And from the immediate ancestor of the word, lying between it and Latin&#x27;s &quot;, -a, -um&quot;, namely, Anglo-Norman &quot;fetide&quot;, attested 13th century.

==Other Germanic languages==
;Old Norse:
&quot;Œ&quot; is used in the modern scholarly orthography of Old West Norse, representing the long vowel , contrasting with &quot;ø&quot;, which represents the short vowel . Sometimes, the &quot;ǿ&quot; is used instead for Old West Norse, maintaining consistency with the designation of the length of the other vowels, e.g. &quot;&quot; &quot;mothers&quot;.

;Middle High German:
&quot;Œ&quot; is also used to express long in the modern scholarly orthography of Middle High German. It contrasts &quot;ö&quot;, pronounced as a short .

;(Modern) German:
&quot;Œ&quot; is not used in modern German. Loanwords using &quot;œ&quot; are generally rendered ö, e.g. &#x27;. A common exception is the French word &#x27; and its compounds (e.g. &quot;&quot; It remains used in Swiss German, especially in the names of people and places.

;Danish:
&quot;Œ&quot; is not used in Danish, just like German, but unlike German, Danish replaces &quot;œ&quot; or &quot;œu&quot; in loan-words with ø, as in &#x27; &quot;economy&quot; from Greek via Latin &#x27; or &#x27; &quot;beef&quot; from French &#x27;. &quot;œ&quot;, mainly lowercase, has historically been used as a typeface alternative to &quot;æ&quot; in Danish.

==Transcription==
The symbol is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) for the open-mid front rounded vowel. This sound resembles the &quot;œu&quot; in the French &#x27; or the &quot;ö&quot; in the German &#x27;. These contrast with French &#x27; and German &#x27;, which have the close-mid front rounded vowel, .

The small capital variant represents the open front rounded vowel in the IPA. 
Modifier letter small ligature oe () is used in extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet.

 is used as an IPA superscript letter.

The Uralic Phonetic Alphabet (UPA) includes .

The Teuthonista phonetic transcription system uses several related symbols:
* 

==Encodings==
In Unicode, the characters are encoded at and . In ISO-8859-15, &quot;Œ&quot; is 0xBC and &quot;œ/ɶ&quot; 0xBD. In Windows-1252, at positions 0x8C and 0x9C. In Mac-Roman, they are at positions 0xCE and 0xCF.

&quot;Œ&quot; and &quot;œ/ɶ&quot; were omitted from ISO-8859-1 (as well as derived standards, such as IBM code page 850), which are still widespread in internet protocols and applications. Œ is the only character in modern French that is not included in ISO-8859-1, and this has led to it becoming replaced by &#x27;oe&#x27; in many computer-assisted publications (including printed magazines and newspapers). This was due, in part, to the lack of available characters in the French ISO/IEC 646 version that was used earlier for computing. Another reason is that &quot;œ&quot; is absent from most French keyboards, and as a result, few people know how to input it.

The above-mentioned small capital of the International Phonetic Alphabet is encoded at .

<text>A heavy cruiser was a type of cruiser, a naval warship designed for long range and high speed, armed generally with naval guns of roughly 203 mm (8 inches) in calibre, whose design parameters were dictated by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the London Naval Treaty of 1930. Heavy cruisers were generally larger, more heavily armed and more heavily armoured than light cruisers while being smaller, faster, and more lightly armed and armoured than battlecruisers and battleships. Heavy cruisers were not considered capital ships, unlike battlecruisers, battleships, and fleet carriers. Heavy cruisers were assigned a variety of roles ranging from commerce raiding to serving as &#x27;cruiser-killers,&#x27; i.e. hunting and destroying similarly sized ships.
The heavy cruiser is part of a lineage of ship design from 1915 through the early 1950s, although the term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; only came into formal use in 1930. The heavy cruiser&#x27;s immediate precursors were the light cruiser designs of the 1900s and 1910s, rather than the armoured cruisers of the years before 1905. When the armoured cruiser was supplanted by the battlecruiser, an intermediate ship type between the battlecruiser and the light cruiser was found to be needed—one larger and more powerful than the light cruisers of a potential enemy but not as large and expensive as the battlecruiser so as to be built in sufficient numbers to protect merchant ships and serve in a number of combat theatres.
With their intended targets being other cruisers and smaller vessels, the role of the heavy cruiser differed fundamentally from that of the armoured cruiser. Also, the heavy cruiser was designed to take advantage of advances in naval technology and design. Typically powered by oil-fired steam turbines rather than the reciprocating steam engines of the armored cruiser, heavy cruisers were capable of far faster speeds and could cruise at high speed for much longer than could an armoured cruiser. They used uniform main guns, mounted in center-line superfiring turrets rather than casemates. Casemate guns and a mixed battery were eliminated to make room for above deck torpedoes, and ever-increasing and more effective anti-aircraft armaments. They also benefited from the superior fire control of the 1920s and continually upgraded through the 1950s. Late in the development cycle radar and electronic countermeasures would also appear and rapidly gain in importance.

== History ==
=== Development ===
At the end of the 19th century, cruisers were classified as first, second or third class depending on their capabilities. First-class cruisers were typically armoured cruisers, with belt side armour, while lighter, cheaper, and faster second- and third-class cruisers tended to have only an armoured deck and protective coal bunkers, rather than armoured hulls; they were hence known as protected cruisers. Their essential role had not changed since the age of sail—to serve on long-range missions, patrol for enemy warships and raid and defend commerce. Armoured cruisers had proved less versatile than needed to do this adequately. In a race to outsize and outgun one another, they had grown to around 15,000 tons and up to in main gun calibre—very close to the pre-dreadnought battleships of the day, although they were generally ascribed to be weaker than the battleship due to their lack of armour and not appreciably faster due to the limits of engine technology at the time. While Japanese armoured cruisers had distinguished themselves at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, the armoured cruiser as it was then known had reached the pinnacle of its development.

Tactics and technology were gearing towards naval encounters held over increasingly longer ranges, which demanded an armament of primarily large calibre guns. The demand for speed with which to outflank a potential enemy and fulfil its traditional role as scout for the fleet demanded a speed preferably 30 percent faster than battleships. Thirty percent was the ratio by which frigates had been faster than ships of the line in the days of sail. If a battleship sailed at 20 knots, this would mean that an armoured cruiser would have to steam at least 26 or 27 knots.

Armoured cruisers could not fulfil these criteria without being built much larger and taking on a different form than they had in the past. The result was the battlecruiser. HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and her two sister ships were designed specifically to fulfil these requirements. In a sense they were an extension of the armoured cruiser as a fast, heavily armed scout, commerce protector and cruiser-destroyer, reflected in the term originally ascribed to them, &quot;large armoured cruiser&quot;. However, they were much larger, faster and better-armed than armoured cruisers, able to outpace them, stay out of range of their weapons and destroy them with relative impunity. Because they carried the heavy guns normally ascribed to battleships, they could also theoretically hold their place in a battle line more readily than armoured cruisers and serve as the &quot;battleship-cruiser&quot; for which William Hovgaard had argued after Tsushima. All these factors made battlecruisers attractive fighting units, although Britain, Germany and Japan would be the only powers to build them. They also meant that the armoured cruiser as it had been known was now outmoded. No more were built after 1910 and by the end of World War I, the majority of them had been taken out of active service.

Although Lord Fisher, the man behind the building of &quot;Invincible&quot;, had hoped to replace practically all forms of cruisers with battlecruisers, they proved to be too costly to build in large numbers. At the same time, the third class cruiser (of about 3,000 tons) started to carry thin steel armour on the outside of its hull and became known as a light cruiser. This new type was then joined by 5,000-ton light cruisers, analogous to the older second-class cruisers. The wide gap between the massive battlecruiser of perhaps 20,000 tons and 305 mm (12-inch) guns and the small light cruiser of up to 5,000 tons and 100 mm (4-in) or 155 mm (6-inch) guns naturally left room for an intermediate type. The first such design was the British &#x27;Atlantic cruiser&#x27; proposal of 1912, which proposed a long-range cruiser of about 8,000 tons displacement with 190 mm (7.5-inch) guns. This was a response to a rumour that Germany was building cruisers to attack merchant shipping in the Atlantic with 170mm guns. The German raiders proved to be fictional and the &#x27;Atlantic cruisers&#x27; were never built. However, in 1915 the requirement for long-range trade-protection cruisers resurfaced and resulted in the . Essentially enlarged light cruisers, being referred to in contemporary reference works as an &quot;improved Birmingham&quot; type after the 6-inch gunned 5,000-ton second-class light cruisers then entering service, the &quot;Hawkins&quot;-class cruisers each carried seven 190 mm (7.5-inch) guns and had a displacement just under 10,000 tons.

The difference between these light cruisers and ones that would follow with the heavy cruiser were almost as pronounced as that between the armoured cruiser and the battlecruiser. One reason for this difference was the intended mission of these light/heavy cruisers which were not intended to serve as a junior battleship, as the armoured cruiser had been, and were not built or designed to serve in that capacity. Armored cruisers were often pressed into the main line of battle against battlecruisers and dreadnought battleships (Battle of the Falkland Islands, Battle of Dogger Bank (1915), Battle of Jutland). By contrast, heavy cruisers and light cruisers were not expected to be deployed as such, although there had been some notable engagements (Battle of the Denmark Strait, Battle of Cape Matapan, Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Battle of Surigao Strait). The heavy cruiser&#x27;s main armament of 203 mm (8-inch) guns was smaller than the typical guns of the last armoured cruisers so their intended targets were other cruisers and smaller vessels. Further reasons for the difference were the advances in technology and naval design, both of which the heavy cruiser was able to take advantage. Heavy cruisers, like all contemporary ships, were typically powered by oil-fired steam turbine engines and were capable of far faster speeds than armoured cruisers had ever been (propelled by coal-fired reciprocating steam engines of their era). Nonetheless, heavy cruisers often had a larger number of main guns (some armoured cruisers had a mixed instead of uniform complement of main guns), discarded the mounting of main guns in casemates in favour of centre-line superfiring turrets (saving tonnage and enabling the ship to fire all guns on one broadside), and benefited from the introduction of fire control in the 1920s and 1930s, meaning that the heavy cruiser was considerably more powerful.

===Washington Treaty===
The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed a moratorium on new battleship construction, with the exception of the two s by Great Britain, and set very strict limits on the tonnage and firepower of future battleships and battlecruisers. It also set the definition of a capital ship as a warship of more than 10,000 tons standard displacement or with armament of a calibre greater than 8 inches (203 mm). There was the concern that a subsequent race in building larger, more powerful cruisers might subvert the usefulness of the prohibition on capital ship construction and encourage navies to squander their now-limited permissible tonnage for capital ships on fast vessels designed specifically to hunt down large cruisers. To avert these challenges, representatives of the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France and Italy set limits on the tonnage and firepower of cruisers to 10,000 tons in standard displacement and 8 inches for maximum main gun caliber. These limits were in the interests of the U.S. and Britain especially. Planners in the U.S. Navy had spent two years prior to the start of negotiations designing 10,000 ton, 8-inch cruisers and were convinced that smaller vessels would not be worthwhile. Britain had just built its &quot;Hawkins&quot;-class cruisers and wanted to ensure they would not fall prey to a much larger type of super-cruiser.

Despite these intentions and set limitations, a number of new, powerful cruiser classes emerged from these nations, which sparked off something of a cruiser arms-race. The Japanese navy had a doctrine of building more powerful ships in every class than its likely opponents, which led to the development of several very impressive heavy cruiser classes. British and American building was more influenced by the desire to be able to match the Japanese ships while keeping enough cruisers for their other global responsibilities. With battleships heavily regulated by the Washington Treaty, and aircraft carriers not yet mature, the cruiser question became the focus of naval affairs. The British, with a strained economy and global commitments, favoured unlimited cruiser tonnage but strict limits on the individual ships. The Americans favoured the opposite: strictly limited numbers of powerful cruisers. Disagreements between the British and Americans wrecked the 1927 conference on naval affairs.

Even during the 1920s, the 10,000-ton limit was not always strictly observed, although British, French and American designers generally worked to the limit with precision. The British built 13 of the with four twin 8-inch gun turrets but with very minimal armour. The ships had fine sea-keeping qualities and a long range, but were virtually unprotected, and were easily damaged in combat. The Japanese , however, grew during its construction as the naval general staff prevailed on the designers to increase the weapons load. As well as a breach of the Treaty, this was a poor decision from the design point of view and the ships had to be reconstructed in the 1930s to reduce weight. The German was classified as armoured coast defence ships under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. They superficially resembled contemporary battleships due to their massive main gun turrets and unusually high conning tower/bridge. However, they were in effect a heavy cruiser being up gunned to 11-inch batteries at the cost of slower speed; their displacement was declared at 10,000 tons but was in practice considerably greater. The Italian Navy first built two s, which sacrificed protection for speed, and then four , a much more balanced and better-protected design, plus an improved replica of the &quot;Trento&quot;s (); all of them, however, surpassed the displacement limit.

The s were the US Navy&#x27;s first &quot;treaty cruisers&quot; designed in line with Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. Their main battery consisted of ten guns, in two twin turrets on the main deck, and two triple turrets two decks above, making it one of the two US Navy ship classes (besides the s) to have different-sized turrets for main armament (Subsequent US cruisers would mount nine 8&quot; guns in three triple turrets 2 fore 1 aft). Their thin armour on the belt (varying from in thickness) and deck was no better than that on 6-inch-gunned cruisers and was inadequate to protect their vitals from enemy 8-inch shells. Also, their unusual main battery layout and heavy tripod fore-masts made these ships top-heavy and prone to excessive rolling. This combined with low freeboard forward made them inferior sea boats compared to later designs. Rework in the shipyards modified the hull and superstructure in the 1930s to eliminate the rolling. The two vessels in this class, &quot;Pensacola&quot; and &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, were originally classified as light cruisers due to their minimal armour until re-designated in July 1931 as heavy cruisers in accord with international practice of designating all cruisers with guns larger than 6&quot;.

===London Treaty===
In 1930 the Washington Naval Treaty was extended by the London Naval Treaty, which finally settled the arguments on cruisers which had raged in the 1920s. The treaty defined limits on both heavy cruisers – those with guns larger than 155 mm (6.1 inches) – and light cruisers – those with smaller-calibre guns. The limit of 10,000 tons displacement still applied to both. This was the point at which the split between &quot;heavy&quot; and &quot;light&quot; cruisers finally became official and widespread.

The Treaty satisfied Britain and America. However, it deeply offended Japan, as this severely limited the numbers of heavy cruisers that the Imperial Japanese Navy could have, as they considered heavy cruisers as key warships in a line of battle with their 8-inch guns and heavy torpedo armament. The IJN placed less priority on purpose-built light cruisers, most of their existing types dating back to the 1920s (the five World War I-era light cruisers that the IJN commissioned were less well-armed than light cruisers of the US and Royal Navies), which were largely relegated to leading destroyer squadrons. The solution the Japanese adopted was to build the , which was declared as a 10,000 ton light cruiser with fifteen 6.1-inch guns. In practice, they displaced over 12,000 tons, had what was effectively a heavy cruiser hull design, and it was always intended to replace her turrets to give a final armament of ten 203 mm guns, making something of a nonsense of the light and heavy cruiser classifications. The waters were muddied further when the US Navy ceased laying down keels for new heavy cruisers in 1934 and used their new hull design for the &quot;Brooklyn&quot; class light cruiser. This type followed in the steps of Mogami by taking what was effectively a heavy cruiser hull and fitting light cruiser guns to it, and while the US Navy never fitted 8-inch guns to their &quot;light&quot; cruisers, the hull design was used as the basis for future heavy cruiser designs.

The German navy also paid lip-service to the treaty limitations, with the displacing 16,170 tons.

In the mid-1930s, Britain, France and Italy ceased building heavy cruisers. It was felt that, in a likely cruiser engagement, a larger number of 155 mm (6-inch) guns would be preferable to a smaller number of 203 mm (8-inch). While the 8-inch gun would inflict more damage when it hit, more 6-inch guns could be carried, likely resulting in more shells on target, and a greater chance of scoring the first hit. This led to the construction of cruisers up to the 10,000-tons limit, with twelve to fifteen 155 mm guns.

The 1936 London Naval Treaty, principally negotiated between Britain and the United States but never ratified, would have abolished the heavy cruiser entirely by restricting new construction to 8,000 tons and 155 mm (6.1-inch) guns. This suited Britain&#x27;s needs very well, but was largely a dead letter. The U.S. continued to build heavy cruisers, culminating in the and .

=== World War II ===

Heavy cruisers were still being built, and they could be balanced designs when nations decided to skirt the restrictions imposed by the London Naval Treaty.

Heavy cruiser order of battle between Japan and the United States and its allies:

* United States (4 classes and 1 ship)
** 2 , 10,000 t, 10 guns
** 6 , 2 , 7 , 10,000 t, 9 guns
** , 10,000 t, 9 guns

* British Commonwealth (5 classes)
**7 , 10,000t, 8 guns
**4 , 10,000t, 8 guns
**2 , 9,925t, 8 guns
**3+1 , 9,800 t, 7 guns
**2 , 8,400t, 6 guns

* Japan (6 classes)
** 2 , 2 , 7,000 t, 6 guns
** 4 , 4 , 4 *, 10,000 t, 10 guns &quot;*converted from light cruisers&quot;
** 2 , 10,000 t, 8 guns

Japan was only allowed 12 heavy cruisers by treaty, but had intentionally built the &quot;Mogami&quot;s with the option to have their main battery changed. The two &quot;Tone&quot;s were also originally planned as light cruisers, but launched after the treaty system broke down with 8-inch guns. At the start of hostilities there was thus a parity between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy with respect to heavy cruisers.

The Germans built their heavy cruisers of 14,000 tons, although the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was supposed to limit their displacement to the 10,000 tons specified by the Washington Naval Treaty.

The US built the of heavy cruisers during the war. While earlier heavy cruisers were noted for their powerful torpedo armament (especially Japanese heavy cruisers), later ships built by the USN concentrated mainly on anti-aircraft armament, as their main role was escorting aircraft carriers and troop transports instead of engaging in surface actions. Most Japanese heavy cruisers were sunk by aircraft or submarines, rather than in surface engagements.

The US built the last heavy cruisers, which were finished shortly after the war. The consisted of seventeen ships, including three of the slightly different . The were the last heavy cruisers built: though based on the &quot;Baltimore&quot;s, they were considerably heavier and longer due to their new rapid-firing 203 mm (8-inch) guns. Additionally, two aircraft carriers were built on a &quot;Baltimore&quot;-derived hull, the .

The largest heavy cruisers were the large cruisers, which were designed as &quot;cruiser killers&quot;. They resembled contemporary battlecruisers or battleships in general appearance, as well as having main armament and displacement equal or greater than that of capital ships of the First World War. However, the &quot;Alaska&quot;s were actually upscaled heavy cruisers, as their machinery layout and the possession of a single rudder was based on cruisers rather than that of battleships or battlecruisers. Furthermore the &quot;Alaska&quot;s lacked the sophisticated underwater protection system featured in battleships and battlecruisers, making them vulnerable to shells and torpedoes that hit under the waterline. The &quot;Alaska&quot;s also had proportionately less weight in armour at 28.4% of displacement, in contrast to the British battlecruiser of 30%, the German and the U.S. Navy&#x27;s s of 40%. Effectively, the &quot;Alaska&quot;s were ill-protected to stand up against the guns of true battleships and battlecruisers, and as carrier escorts they were much more expensive than the &quot;Baltimore&quot;s while having only slightly better anti-aircraft capabilities. Given low priority by the USN, only two members of the &quot;Alaska&quot;s were completed and they saw little service as World War II ended not long after their commissioning.

Heavy cruisers fell out of use after the Second World War, with the Royal Navy decommissioning its last three (, , and ) by the early 1950s. Some existing US heavy cruisers lasted well through the 1970s, with the last all-gun ship decommissioning in 1975. , and , which had been converted to guided missile cruisers (US hull symbol CG), were laid up between 1975 and 1980.

<doc id="197978" wikidata="Q311916" url="?curid=197978" title="Uday Hussein">
<text>Uday Saddam Hussein (; 18 June 1964 – 22 July 2003) was an Iraqi politician, military commander and businessman, and the elder son of Saddam Hussein. He held numerous positions as a sports chairman, military officer and businessman, and was the head of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Iraq Football Association, and the Fedayeen Saddam.

Uday Hussein was born in Baghdad. He was the eldest child of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and his first wife and cousin, Sajida Talfah. Uday was seen for several years as the likely successor to his father but lost the place as heir apparent to his younger brother, Qusay, due to injuries in an assassination attempt. Following the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, he was killed alongside Qusay and his nephew Mustafa by an American task force after a prolonged gunfight in Mosul.

== Early life and education ==
Uday Saddam Hussein Al-Nasiri Al Tikriti was born in Al-Karkh, Baghdad, to Saddam Hussein and Sajida Talfah while his father was in prison. Multiple sources give different birth dates; although official sources give a birth date of 18 June 1964, &quot;The Independent&quot; gave a birth date of 9 March 1964, while others give a 1965 birth. One source gave it as early as 1963. He was rumored to have played with disarmed grenades as an infant. As a child, he and his younger brother Qusay would witness executions with their father.

Uday attended al-Mansour school in Baghdad in the 1970s. One of his teachers was Dinah Bentley, an English teacher from Yorkshire who married an Iraqi and briefly taught at the school. Uday was reportedly driven to school by a chauffeur in a Mercedes-Benz and surrounded by servants. He picked up his English teacher&#x27;s Yorkshire accent and was described as a cheerful, bright child who was responsive to discipline, but an average student who struggled to concentrate.

He began studies at Baghdad Medical College, but only stayed for three days. Then he moved to the College of Engineering, and obtained a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Baghdad. He wrote his master&#x27;s thesis on &quot;Iraqi military strategy during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war&quot;. He obtained a doctorate in political science from the University of Baghdad in 1998 and the title of his dissertation was &quot;The world after the Cold War&quot;, in which he predicted the United States would no longer be a world power in 2015. Some have argued that Uday did not have academic prowess and his theses were written by others in exchange for money and gifts, with no one able to give Uday a low score out of fear. &quot;He was really smart, probably smarter than his father—but he was crazy,&quot; said one of his classmates about Uday.

== Torture of Iraqi athletes ==

In 1984, after Uday graduated from university, Saddam appointed him chairman of the Iraqi Olympic Committee and the Iraq Football Association. In the former role, he tortured athletes who failed to win. According to Latif Yahia, Uday&#x27;s alleged body double, &quot;The word that defines him is sadistic. I think Saddam Hussein was more human than Uday. The Olympic Committee was not a sports center, it was Uday&#x27;s world&quot;.

Raed Ahmed, an Iraqi athlete who defected to the United States, said: &quot;During training, he would watch all the athletes closely, and put pressure on the coaches to push the athletes even more. If he was not happy with the results, he would have coaches and athletes put in his private prison in the Olympic Committee building. The punishment was Uday&#x27;s private prison where they tortured people. Some athletes, including the best ones, started quitting the sport once Uday took over the Committee ... I always managed not to be punished. I made sure not to promise anything. There is a strong possibility of always being beaten. But when I won, Uday would be very happy.&quot; In 2005, a video of Uday questioning Raed&#x27;s family was released. They were then reportedly transported by car to a prison, where they remained for 16 days in poor conditions.

Ammo Baba, whose football teams won 18 tournaments and participated in three Olympics, said that Uday&#x27;s punishment destroyed players&#x27; athletic abilities. Baba said that half of the Iraqi athletes had left the country, and many had feigned illness before playing against strong competitors; he reportedly told his friends that if he died suddenly, they would know the reason. Maad Ibrahim Hamid, assistant coach of the national football team, said that Uday rewarded players financially for winning and threatened them with imprisonment if they lost. According to Hamid, athletes were not tortured; some were arrested for immoral behaviour, however (including adultery and addiction to alcohol), and for playing poorly. Ahmed Radhi said that after he was unwilling to join the new Al-Rasheed club, he was kidnapped at midnight by Uday&#x27;s men, beaten and accused of harassment; he accepted Uday&#x27;s offer when he was threatened with death. International footballer Saad Qais said that Uday was angry with him because he was sent off during a 1997 match against Turkmenistan. His &quot;discipline&quot; was administered by jailers (known as &quot;teachers&quot;) in a closed section of a detention facility for athletes and journalists in Radwaniyah Palace. According to Qais, &quot;Uday established the Rashid team and forced the best Iraqi players to play in it, and forced me to leave my beloved team, and he honored us with gifts after every win, but he also punished us after every loss.&quot;

== Murder of Kamel Hana Gegeo ==
Although his status as Saddam&#x27;s elder son made him Saddam&#x27;s prospective successor, Uday fell out of favour with his father due to his public erraticness. In October 1988, at a party in honour of Suzanne Mubarak, wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Uday murdered his father&#x27;s personal valet and food taster, Kamel Hana Gegeo, possibly at the request of his mother. Gegeo had recently introduced Saddam to a younger woman, Samira Shahbandar, who had become Saddam&#x27;s second wife in 1986. Uday considered his father&#x27;s relationship with Shahbandar an insult to his mother. Shahbandar&#x27;s oldest son fled to Jordan because of the harassment by Uday after the marriage. Uday also may have feared losing succession to Gegeo, whose loyalty to Saddam Hussein was unquestioned.

As punishment for the murder, Saddam briefly imprisoned Uday. Once released, Uday was sent to Switzerland to act as the assistant to the Iraqi ambassador there. He was expelled by the Swiss government in 1990, after he was repeatedly arrested for fighting. According to Jalopnik, Uday&#x27;s vast car collection was burned by his father after the Gegeo incident.

Others describe the murder as follows: Next to the palace where Suzanne Mubarak and Uday&#x27;s mother were staying, Kamel Hana was celebrating the wedding of a relative and firing in the air, so Uday sent his men and asked them not to bother the two women. During the discussion, Uday hit Kamel&#x27;s head with his walking stick, causing Kamel&#x27;s death. Uday, afraid of his father&#x27;s reaction, tried to commit suicide and was taken to the hospital. He escaped from the hospital, set up a barricade around his home, and fired at anyone trying to enter his home. He surrendered with the persuasion of his brother Qusay.

According to the memory of Uday&#x27;s step-uncle Barzan, after escaping from the hospital he went to his father&#x27;s palace and told him to &quot;stay with your real wife&quot;. Then Saddam said to Barzan, &quot;He was lucky because I had no weapon with me.&quot; But Uday later came to the door of the palace again and told Barzan that he intended to shoot his father. He fired at his brother Qusay and at step-uncles who were trying to prevent him from doing so. Later, under the guidance of Barzan, Uday apologized to his father. His father ordered him to surrender. When his brothers-in-law Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel learned that he was trying to escape to the United States, he was arrested on his father&#x27;s orders, but released three weeks later. After the incident, Uday attacked two people whom he thought were informers. At the request of Saddam, Uday was sent out of Iraq under the control of Barzan to Switzerland in order to get rid of the disgrace caused by Uday.

Muhammad Asim Shanshal, head of the private office of Uday, said, &quot;After a call from his mother, Sajida, told him that Kamel Hanna holds a joyful party for Saddam&#x27;s second wife, Samira Shahbandar. There was shooting, rejoicing, and Uday shouting in the face of &#x27;Kamel Hanna&#x27;, denounced: &quot;What is the mess?!&quot; And he said: We celebrate on the occasion of lady and the President. Uday threatened him and warned him not to shoot bullets in the air, so it was &#x27;Kamel Hanna&#x27; except that he raised his weapon in the air and fired bullets, so Uday&#x27;s response was a fatal blow to his head with a heavy club that was with him, and he was killed. Saddam imprisoned all his guards and those who were with him, who were 15 individuals, and I was supposed to be with them had it not been for the delay that saved me from prison. They were sentenced to imprisonment, and Uday was exiled from Iraq to Switzerland for a period of six months.&quot;

President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt called Uday a &quot;psychopath&quot;.

== Shooting of Watban Ibrahim ==
In 1995, during a fight between his maternal uncle Louay and paternal half uncle Watban, Uday shot Watban as well as the other guests at the party. The shooting left six bodyguards dead and Watban seriously injured. Uday then took Watban to the hospital and disappeared. Because his brothers-in-law, Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel, escaped to Jordan the next day, Uday&#x27;s attack on his uncle remained in the background. Saddam ordered Uday to ask his uncle to shoot him in the same way as Uday had shot him, but Watban refused to do so. One of the injured at the party said that the reason for the attack was that Uday&#x27;s half-uncle had mocked Uday&#x27;s speech disorder, and his maternal uncle had told Uday about it. Since birth, Uday&#x27;s upper jaw has extended forward an abnormally large amount, making it difficult for him to speak clearly. At the ceremony, his uncle had imitated him mockingly. Shortly after the incident, Saddam got angry when he saw his half-brother in the hospital having difficulty walking, and he ordered the garage for Uday&#x27;s luxury cars to be burned down. Uday was angry with his brother Qusay for not preventing Saddam and had a nervous breakdown. Qusay said he prevented him from burning another garage. Uday set up a barricade in front of his luxury cars in another nearby garage, armed himself with weapons, and waited for his father or his men to come. According to his close friend Jaber, Uday would have killed him if his father had come to the second garage. 

Abbas Al Janabi said: &quot;The reason why Uday shot Watban was a result of a business conflict between Lu&#x27;ayy Khayrallah Tulfa [Sajida&#x27;s brother; Uday&#x27;s maternal uncle and his childhood friend] and one of Saddam&#x27;s other half-brothers, with Watban becoming the victim. Following Uday&#x27;s shooting of [his uncle] Watban, Saddam tried to confiscate and blow up Uday&#x27;s cars in one garage. But that garage contained only thirteen cars. Saddam did not know that Uday has several other garages; I know of at least six more.&quot;

== Murder of Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel ==
According to the book &quot;The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein&quot; by John Nixon, Uday provoked the escape of Hussein Kamel al-Majid and Saddam Kamel in 1995. A drunk Uday went to Kamel&#x27;s house where a party was being held and punched Saddam Kamel. When he was defeated by Kamel, he took out his gun and fired, but accidentally wounded Watban, who got in the way. Shortly after the grooms escaped to Jordan, Saddam burned the garage for Uday&#x27;s luxury cars, saying, &quot;While Iraqis are suffering from the embargo, this situation may send a false message.&quot; Uday took over Iraq&#x27;s oil sales, previously largely pocketed by the entourage of Hussein Kamel when he oversaw the oil business along with his responsibilities in defense and industry, Uday also zeroed in on other areas that had been the province of Kamel, including army equipment supplies, reconstruction and food imports. An Iraqi official said, &quot;Kamel decided to defect because he became frightened that Uday was now getting strong enough to really take care of him.&quot;

Along with many other crimes, he along with Qusay in 1996, was said to be involved in the killings of their brothers-in-law, Hussein Kamel and Saddam Kamel, who themselves were powerful members of the elite regime. The two men, who had defected to Jordan along with their wives and children, were murdered after their return to Iraq.

About the murder, Abbas Al Janabi, said: &quot;The decision to eliminate Husayn Kamil was not decided ahead of time but only after his return to Baghdad. On his return, Husayn Kamil was asked to go to the presidential palace. Saddam asked that both he and his brother divorce their wives (Saddam&#x27;s daughters), but they both refused. In addition to Uday, Saddam had asked a prominent judge to attend the meeting with Husayn Kamil to prepare the divorce papers. I was at the palace at the time but I stayed outside the meeting room. I waited for &#x27;Uday to leave the room, and he told me the details. After his refusal, Husayn Kamil went to his palace in the Ad-Dura area. The decision to eliminate them took place after their refusal to divorce. The decision to execute Husayn Kamil came from Saddam personally. Saddam had also decided that the execution should be carried out by Husayn Kamil&#x27;s cousins in the al-Majid clan. It was the duty of Uday, Qusay, and Ali Hasan al-Majid to oversee the executions. Uday was not an initial proponent of his execution. However, after Husayn Kamil refused to divorce Uday&#x27;s sister, Uday became a supporter of the decision to execute Husayn Kamil and his brother.&quot; On that day, Janabi said, &quot;With a loudspeaker, Uday said to him &#x27;You and your brother have to divorce the girls, this is your last chance.&#x27; Instead of answering them, Kamel shoot them.&quot; The shoot-out lasted 13 hours. Then brothers and their father came out to surrender and they were dumped out. &quot;After they kill him, from a very near distance they shoot him, many bullets in his body. He was just swimming with a lake of blood.&quot;

== Assassination attempt ==
Uday sustained permanent injuries during an assassination attempt while in his Porsche on the evening of 12 December 1996. Struck by between 7 and 17 bullets while driving in al-Mansour, Baghdad, Uday was initially believed to be paralyzed. Evacuated to Ibn Sina Hospital, he eventually recovered but with a noticeable limp. Despite repeated operations, two bullets remained lodged in his spine and could not be removed due to their location. In the wake of Uday&#x27;s subsequent disabilities, Saddam gave Qusay increasing responsibility and authority, designating him as his heir apparent in 2000. However, Abbas al-Janabi claimed that Uday&#x27;s exclusion in the family ended after shooting his step-uncle Watban after this assassination. An American hypnotist from Chicago, Larry Garrett, travelled to Baghdad twice in April and September 2001, where he utilized hypnotism to treat Uday&#x27;s inability to walk with his left leg and spent over 60 hours of personal time with Uday. Garrett said of Uday, &quot;He was an educated man, with a background in engineering. He was versed in the Koran. He had visited the U.S. with his cousin when he was 17. He expressed some political views, but he didn&#x27;t involve me in them. I must say I was developing a fondness for him. He never spoke to me as a leader or the son of a leader. He never condescended. It was just two men sitting around at night.&quot; He published a book of his experiences with Uday in Iraq, initially titled &quot;Healing the enemy: Hypnotic Nights in Baghdad&quot;, but later changed to &quot;Hypnotizing the Devil: The True Story of a Hypnotist Who Treated the Psychotic Son of Saddam Hussein&quot;. He met with Uday on the day of the September 11 attacks, where Uday had great concern for Garrett&#x27;s safety and told him Iraq would likely be blamed for the attack.

The Shia Shaaban movement assumed responsibility for the assassination attempt. Salman Sharif, one of the four would-be assassins who attacked Uday, learned that he regularly visited one of the luxurious streets of al-Mansour every Thursday at around 7 in the evening to pick up a girl. They watched the street for three months and made preparations. They realized that Uday was sometimes unprotected and tried to find out which shop owners and workers on the street were part of the secret police, and who were real shopkeepers. On the day of the assassination attempt, they saw a luxury car that could only belong to Uday without bodyguards. They shot at Uday exactly 50 times, with 17 hits. Some Shaaban members who knew about this assassination attempt were arrested for another incident in Jordan and handed over to the Iraqi police. In August 1998, Saddam&#x27;s men arrested Abu Sajad and learned the details of other members of the team. Sharif&#x27;s seven brothers and father were imprisoned, and his mother was then told to collect their bodies from the Baghdad morgue. The father and three brothers of would-be assassin Abu Sadeq were executed. Abu Sajad and his father shared the same fate. Security guards destroyed the homes of all families with bulldozers and confiscated all their property. Iraqi intelligence eventually traced Abu Sadeq to a location in Iran where he was assassinated on the elder Hussein&#x27;s orders in December 2002.

Uday never fully recovered from the injuries he sustained during the attack; purportedly walking with a limp for the rest of his life and—according to popular belief—becoming impotent. Sharif interpreted this as &quot;divine justice&quot;, referring to Uday&#x27;s brutal reputation with women. 

According to Alaa Bashir, the surgeon who operated on Uday, &quot;He was not impotent because the injury was far from the reproductive system.&quot; He said that Uday saw the assassination attempt as God&#x27;s revenge for having shot his uncle in the same leg. He said, &quot;Saddam entered the operating room. He looked at his son with calmness, and if any other person, whatever his strength, saw his son in such a scene, he would&#x27;ve lost his temper, but Saddam did not shook his time, but turned around his son and said to him despite his knowledge Uday was unconscious, &#x27;My son, such things are possible and can be expected for men, but we are right and they are false.&#x27; Then he kissed him on his forehead and left. Then he met his son Qusay and said to him, &#x27;My son. These things happen to the men, except for a bullet or a wound with a knife. These are normal matters, but you must prepare yourself for the worst day.&#x27; Then he went out.&quot; About Uday&#x27;s personality, Alaa Bashir said, &quot;Uday was scary because he was unbalanced and did not care about anyone. He often attacked the leadership, and no one stood up to him, so I avoided him and did not come close to him. Uday used to hate me a lot and tried to offend me and caused me a lot of problems, but his father&#x27;s interest in me was a deterrent in front of him.&quot;

Abbas al-Janabi, who had worked with Uday as his secretary for 15 years, claimed that every Iraqi knew that Uday had come to that street on Thursdays and claimed that Uday had become much more brutal after the assassination attempt. He also claimed that Uday was outraged by the rumors that he was impotent after the assassination attempt and ordered the secret police to make up stories about his virility. Janabi said, &quot;Uday is a sadist, a monster. I saw how he laughed when someone was whipped.&quot; He also claimed that he witnessed dozens of rapes. He said that what makes Uday sexually excited was violence: &quot;This is his nature, rape is like a hobby for him, and believe me, I know what I am talking about and I am not exaggerating.&quot; Janabi said, &quot;I saw how he tortured people, how he laughed, how he enjoyed it, you can&#x27;t control him, he is a kind of maniac, he is a psychologically imbalanced person.&quot; He said that Uday never kept friends around for long because he enjoyed scaring them. Uday didn&#x27;t think that it was clean for his dogs to retrieve the birds he shot, so he would force his friends to act as retrievers when he went hunting. He said that Uday neutralized women who refused him with alcohol and drugs, raped them, recorded it, and if the victim&#x27;s family was important, he terrorized the family by blackmail. He said that Uday even started to look at 12-year-old girls after he was 30 years old. Unlike their fathers, he said that Uday and Qusay are not the type of people to surrender.

Alaa Bashir claimed that Uday had sustained brain damage due to low blood pressure after the assassination attempt, but doctors could not report this damage to Saddam. Again, according to Bashir, on the day of the incident, Ali Al Sahar, the brother of singer Kadim El Sahar, was with Uday, and the attempt was made on Uday&#x27;s life when Ali got out of the car to give Uday&#x27;s phone number to some girls that Uday liked. Ali immediately took Uday to the hospital. Qusay told his father that the incident happened when Uday went to buy food to break his fasting, but Saddam said to Ali, &quot;I know you were going to pick up girls there.&quot; Earlier it was claimed that Uday was jealous of singer Kadim Al Sahar because of his fame in Iraq and Kadim had to leave Iraq because of his threats. Abbas Al Janabi said: &quot;The interesting point here is that the person who saved Uday&#x27;s life by driving him to the hospital, the singer Ali as-Sahir, received a death threat from Saddam personally in front of others. I was waiting outside the hospital with Qusay when Saddam arrived in a helicopter. He asked for Ali as-Sahir, who was brought to him. In front of us, Saddam told him: &#x27;If anything happens to Uday, I will cut you in pieces.&#x27; Saddam thought that Sahir was behind the attempt.&quot;

After the assassination attempt, Uday said to the press: &quot;I feel fine. I&#x27;m recovering. I feel like any leader of a team would feel if he had been betrayed. I feel that what has happened is not man&#x27;s work (meaning this was a cowardly act). God bless the Iraqi people. God save Iraq. God save Saddam.&quot; 

Later, Uday told CNN his wounds are a source of pride and honor. He cited a family history of wounds acquired in battle, ending with his father, wounded in an operation &quot;for the party&quot; in 1959. &quot;And now this has happened to me,&quot; he said. &quot;The attack was nothing unusual. It could happen any time, because we are surrounded by countries, some of whom are hostile,&quot; none more so than Iran, he said. &quot;Time has proved that Iran is involved in such incidents. Incidents such as this have occurred throughout the region, not just in Iraq.&quot; He warned that Iran is growing in power, saying it is &quot;not in the interests of the United States to increase hostility and hatred in the region.&quot;

== Sexual assault allegations ==
In 1987, Uday allegedly raped the 15-year-old daughter of his father&#x27;s mistress Shaqraa, a Greek-Lebanese former pageant holder who was the daughter of an oil businessman. When Saddam was informed of what happened, after several hours, Uday was put in prison but released after a short period. Because the girl had not kept silent about the rape, Uday&#x27;s bodyguards tortured her with electric batons with Uday present.

In 1999, an anti-embargo group of French volunteers went to Iraq and a woman was forced to stay with Uday after the party, but they were able to leave the party when one of the women said &quot;we did not come here to be prostitutes&quot;. Miss Germany, Alexandra Vodjanikova, met with Uday and said &quot;he was charming, downright warm, very friendly and always said to her &#x27;you are beautiful, you are sexy&#x27;&quot;.

One of his former classmates, Aziz Al-Taee, said: Zainab Salbi, daughter of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s private pilot said, &quot;The days when Uday came to the university, the girls were hiding in the toilet in fear to escape from his hungry eyes, but it is a known fact that nobody can escape from the lust of Uday and Uday is known for his eerie quietness than for wild craziness.&quot; One of his long-time employees, Khaled Jassem, said: 

According to a former employee, Uday would party five nights a week and fast for the remaining two days. The chief of the Baghdad Hunting Club claimed that after a wedding party in the late 1990s, the bride suddenly disappeared, Uday&#x27;s bodyguards locked all the doors, and the groom committed suicide. Again, according to the allegations of Uday&#x27;s servant, he witnessed forced custody of a crying bride at home in October 2002 and later said that the girl was killed, and her body was destroyed after she was raped. When the city was about to fall to US-led forces, it was alleged that Uday ordered Fedayeen Saddam to burn his cars instead of letting others take their cars. Former business manager Adib Shabaan said that Uday burned the hips of many women with whom he had sex with a horseshoe, creating a U-shaped scar. Alaa Bashir, the doctor of the Saddam family, claimed that he was treating women who were in the same condition and who had been burned with a lit cigarette by Uday.

Adeeb al-Ani, who was Uday&#x27;s secretary, said, Uday&#x27;s assistant, Adib Shabaan, said: &quot;In 1998, Uday saw an ex-governor&#x27;s 14-year-old daughter at a party, had her kidnapped, sent her home after three days, and when the girl&#x27;s father was informed about the rape and talked about what happened, Uday told the man, &#x27;Your daughters will be my girlfriends, or I will erase you from the earth,&#x27; and ordered the man to bring his daughter and his other 12-year-old daughter to his next party.&quot; According to a former employee, &quot;Five nights a week, two dozen girls, all brought to him by his friends, were taken to the luxurious Baghdad Boat Club on the Tigris coast to meet Uday; those who were chosen after drinks, music, and dance would spend the night with Uday&quot;. &quot;He never slept with a girl more than three times,&quot; said an ex-butler. If a friend used the same brand of clothes, perfumes, or shoes as Uday, Uday would threaten his friend not to use the same thing again. A family friend said that the day Uday discovered the Internet was &quot;a black day for the Iraqis&quot;, and he had employees whose job was to investigate new methods of torture and new car models on the Internet. In the Boat Club&#x27;s kitchen there was a monkey named Louisa, and if one of Uday&#x27;s friends fell asleep at parties because of alcohol, he would put them in the same cage with the drunk monkey.

According to one of Uday&#x27;s close circle, &quot;If the girl he chose did not want Uday, if she found another boyfriend or was late or reluctant, she would have to dance after getting her feet whipped.&quot; Again, according to a friend&#x27;s claim, Uday would make fun of the girls who lost their virginity because he knew that no one would touch them later and would say, &quot;She will have to be a prostitute from now on.&quot; Again, one of his employees said, &quot;He had a secretary hunting the girls – in universities, ministries. They even had a bedroom in the Olympic offices for women brought to him. They generally agreed to sleep with him. They had no other choice.&quot;

He had allegations against him as recently as early March 2003, shortly before the invasion, when a 13-year-old girl said she accompanied her older sister to Jadriea Equestrian Club, which he frequented. She alleged that she was taken by his bouncers to a back room and raped by him, in which she was given 250,000 Iraqi dinars (about $200).

=== Body double allegations ===
In his memoir, &quot;I was Saddam&#x27;s Son&quot;, Uday&#x27;s alleged body double Latif Yahia said that he witnessed rapes, killings and torture by Uday Hussein. Yahia claimed that in 1987, he was forced to be Uday&#x27;s body double, even going through plastic surgery to resemble him more. According to Yahia, Uday raped a little Palestinian girl who was selling flowers in the Al-Rashid Hotel, and later raped and murdered a little deaf girl in Nineveh. Uday also ordered the kidnapping of Ilham Ali al-Aazami, Miss Iraq, after she had rejected him. Uday and his bodyguards subsequently held her captive and raped her for weeks, and started the rumor that she was a prostitute, causing her to be killed by her father. When the father confronted Uday, the latter spoke disparagingly about the girl, causing the father to lose control to the point of first verbally accosting and ultimately physically assailing Uday. This prompted Uday to order Latif to shoot the rather than acquiesce, Latif instead refused and attempted to commit suicide. Ultimately the father was murdered by one of Uday&#x27;s bodyguards. On another occasion, Uday attacked a newlywed couple and raped the bride in the al-Medina Hotel. She then committed suicide by throwing herself off the balcony. Her husband, a lieutenant, was later killed for &quot;insulting the president&quot;.

&quot;Irish Times&quot; journalist Eoin Butler and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalist Ed Caesar have questioned Yahia&#x27;s various claims, including that he was Uday Hussein&#x27;s body double, and pointed out that many of Yahia&#x27;s activities since leaving Iraq in 1992, including his education, have not been verified. Individuals close to Yahia and Hussein denied that the former was the latter&#x27;s body-double, or denied that Hussein had even had a body double. Yahia disputes these claims, stating that his very existence as a body double was a state secret.

== Partying ==
Uday was known for forcing guests to drink large quantities of alcohol at his parties. According to a friend, whoever earned Uday&#x27;s friendship had to drink a cocktail named the &quot;Uday Saddam Hussein&quot;, a mixture of whiskey, brandy, vodka, cognac, and beer. The cocktail was served in a large &quot;cup of friendship&quot;, and the new friend had to drink it all. Uday had employees whose job was to make people and especially singers drink cocktails containing 90% alcohol, sometimes including drugs. The guard would line up all the entertainment against the wall and give them 10 minutes to drink. Those who did not drink despite the threats were punished in three ways; having their hair and eyebrows shaven off, being beaten enough to stand up without touching their faces, and being subjected to a foot whipping before being forced to walk. Often, the tortures were done in front of Uday in person. If the bodyguards did not do this, or when asked to answer correctly who was drinking and who did not, they would receive the same punishment. The bodyguards alleged that they tortured people in this way twice a week and at least 100 people a year. &quot;When Uday wanted for a car, no one could stop him,&quot; one of his employees said. His employees claimed that they were also tortured by Uday or on Uday&#x27;s orders. A source claimed that he killed his friend after forcing him to drink large quantities of alcohol, and this is not the first time that Uday has killed those close to him in this way. 

Ismail Hussain, who worked as a singer at Uday&#x27;s parties in the early 1990s, said &quot;Uday did not need a reason to party. He would have food and drink tables while many people in Iraq were starving. He&#x27;d get drunk and dance—he was a good dancer too. Later, he&#x27;d bring out the machine guns and start shooting them off. He&#x27;d point the guns right over my head, and the bullets would spray all over the place. I would sing right through the flying bullets. I couldn&#x27;t hear the music anymore. I&#x27;d just keep going, because I couldn&#x27;t stop. It ended when Uday was ready for it to end. At the parties, there would be about five or six men and 40 or 50 women. He was moody. People were expendable.&quot; He said, &quot;I would be performing, and Uday would climb up on the stage with a machine gun and start shooting it at the ceiling. Uday would insist that everyone get drunk with him. He would interrupt my performance, get up on stage with a big glass of cognac for himself and one for me. He would insist that I drink all of it with him. When he gets really drunk, out come the guns. His friends are all terrified of him, because he can have them imprisoned or killed. I saw him once get angry with one of his friends. He kicked the man in the ass so hard that his boot flew off. The man ran over and retrieved the boot and then tried to put it back on Uday&#x27;s foot, with Uday cursing him all the while.&quot;

Singer Qasim Sultan was called to the Hunting Club in 1997 after singing at private parties in the United States and returning to Baghdad. Uday ordered him to sing until the sun rose. At 8:00a.m., Uday began shouting at Sultan, scolded him for returning to Baghdad without telling him and told his guards to beat him. When Sultan went to another midnight concert by Uday, Uday&#x27;s bodyguards beat him for not arriving earlier. Before Sultan came on the stage, he was called by Uday to drink his &quot;mysterious cocktail&quot;, a mixture of beer, gin and other hard liquors. Sultan was hospitalized twice because of the amount of alcohol he was forced to drink at these parties. He also claimed that in 1997, after the assassination attempt, in the garden of Uday&#x27;s palace, he was forced to sing among the lions. He described the parties as &quot;a place where armed cowboys can kill you at any time.&quot; After Al-Shabab was founded in 1993, Iraqi singers of the 70s and 80s, such as Fadel Awad, Saadoun Jaber and Riyadh Ahmed were banned by Uday, on the grounds that they were the singers of the previous generation. Uday said to them, &quot;You are forbidden from singing and I do not want to hear that any of you sings at a party.&quot; The ban was issued, their songs were not shown on TV, they did not perform any concert, and did not record a song for TV. However, Singer Ali Al-Issawi said, &quot;Uday was a fan of singing and a connoisseur and he listened to all the singers and enjoyed our songs. Uday did not punish anyone at that time, but he only held accountable the abusive artists. He used to meet with me two to three times during the same day and did not harm me or my group at all.&quot;

== Other ventures ==
Uday founded his own sports club called Al-Rasheed and signed all the best players from the country to play for the club. They went on to dominate Iraqi football until the team was dissolved in 1990. He also became the editor of the &quot;Babel&quot; newspaper, the general secretary of the Iraqi Union of Students and the head of the Fedayeen Saddam, as well as the head of the Iraq Journalists Union. His newspaper, &quot;Babel&quot;, was known for carrying Western reports on Iraq&#x27;s conflict with the United States and was said to be the most influential newspaper in the country. Uday also had a television channel, Youth TV (Al-Shabab), which aired reports by other Arab channels not usually heard on Iraq&#x27;s state-run media. Uday used his media empire to discredit people who got in his way. Iraq&#x27;s most popular radio station was Voice of Youth, owned by Uday, the only radio station that played Western music. Uday seemed proud of his reputation and called himself &quot;Abu Sarhan&quot;, an Arabic term for &quot;wolf&quot;.

Uday also ran a food processing business called Super Chicken, which reportedly earned him millions of dollars, and an ice cream company called the Wave.

Uday was responsible for nearly 20 American prisoners of war captured during the 1991 Gulf War, including ex-Navy Commander Jeff Zaun, forced to appear on Iraqi state television and forced to condemn their country after being tortured.

Saad al-Bazzaz, who was the editor-in-chief of Uday&#x27;s newspapers and state television, said, &quot;In an editorial meeting, Uday got angry at an article in my newspaper and took out his gun. You could imagine our reaction when he started playing with the gold-plated Kalashnikov while yelling at us. After that, any kind of dialogue with him was impossible. When Uday took over most of the media, the situation in Iraq got worse. This man had nothing to do with journalism, but he saw that media is a powerful way to try to control the minds of the Iraqi people. He knew very well that many journalists did not support his father. Many people worked against the regime at night. Some were beaten and executed. Others were killed or fled the country, leaving their families vulnerable to Uday&#x27;s bloody revenge retaliation.&quot;

Dhafer Muhammad Jaber Siddiq, one of Uday&#x27;s closest aides, said about Uday: &quot;He used to criticize his father&#x27;s policies on many occasions, directly or indirectly, especially when discussing with Hussein Kamel... Uday was a young man like many young men trying to get close to beautiful women. He would send his phone number to every young woman he liked. There were a lot of women who were trying to get to know Uday, some of them changed their minds, and some of them strengthened their relationship with him...He was a person with many contradictions. For example, after the killing of his uncle, Minister of Defense Adnan Khairallah in 1989, he started to pray regularly and never cut it, and he fasted every Monday and Thursday, but he used to drink alcohol continuously. He was generous at times to the extreme, but at other times, he became unimaginably stingy. He had his independent empire. He used to say it himself, he used to say that he possessed the foundations of a state. He had press, television, sports, military and trade.&quot; Uday got a lawyer shot after he raised the case of a 17-year-old girl who was kidnapped and was rumored to be at Uday&#x27;s Iraqi Olympic Committee compound. According to the lawyer&#x27;s testimony, &quot;Uday was looking at the papers I carried for him and then said: I will break both of your legs so that you cannot come back again, but I see your left leg was injured during the war with Iran, so I will break your right leg.&quot; One of Uday&#x27;s men then shot the right leg of the lawyer, and had him thrown off near a hospital. As for the girl, she was finally sent to her home after being raped repeatedly and asked her family not to travel. However, she managed to escape to Poland, where some of her relatives lived. But after a few years, some of the killers working for Uday were able to track down the girl and they killed her along with her father, the lawyer said. Some of the waiters working in high-end clubs said that they would shrink with terror whenever Uday arrived, drunk and armed, looking for women to kidnap. A lawyer said that Uday had ordered the head of a beautiful TV presenter to be shaved so that he could keep her long strands and then kept her naked in the Olympic Committee building for a month because she opposed his request.

Muhammad Asim Shanshal, head of the private office of Uday, said, &quot;Uday by providing all the possibilities and needs for poors, as he allocated about 40% of the Olympic Committee&#x27;s revenues as the head of the Olympic Committee, as he was coordinating with the rest of the ministries to allocate 20% of each ministry to poor families... They were spreading these rape rumours to discredit him, so it was not because Uday forced any girl to engage in obscenity, but we must note that any young man in any country has certain relationships and whims. He was a young man who had connections, and he was loved by everyone, and everyone wished to accompany him, but he was a smart person, as he knew very well and with an understanding of how to identify friends. Uday used to provide everything necessary for the players from homes, cars and all means of rest and decent living. But everything that happened if any player made a mistake was reprimanded by Uday, so if the player kept repeating mistakes, he had to be punished. The penalty was to stop him from playing and not participate in the team, until he regained consciousness, and apologized, and if the player insisted on the mistake, his punishment was severe, refer to legal matter. Uday was bloody fierce in the moment only, and after he laughed and loved fun.&quot;

In the last years of the regime, the Fedayeen Saddam troops led by Uday cut off the heads of 30 prostitutes and threw them in front of their homes. A member of a guerrilla group whose duties were mainly special operations of Saddam&#x27;s Fedayeen said that they assassinated figures opposed to the regime, shattering the appearance of those who were accused of hiding the truth from the government. He said, &quot;If Uday said, cut his tongue, hands, fingers, or head, or anything, we do that. As for the penalties that do not amount to death, they were executed according to a specific system, those who steal cut their fingers and hands. Those who lie, throw heavy stones on their backs, while informants who transmit incorrect information, put hot irons in their mouths, and those who evade the army, cut their ears.&quot; When Uday wanted to kill someone, he sent a group equipped with ten photographs of the target. The process would be recorded with video or audio to demonstrate that it was carried out and Uday would maintain a set of these videotapes.

== Financial and property interests ==
It has been claimed that Uday had taken advantage of the United Nations sanctions in Iraq and built an immense wealth and influence empire. He supplied oil, cigarettes and other prohibited materials through smuggling and sold them on the black market in Iraq. He also sold alcohol and racehorses to rich Gulf countries. He opened accounts with Yahoo! and MSN Messenger, which created controversy as this allegedly violated U.S. trade sanctions against Iraq. Uday also amassed a large video collection, found in his palace in 2003, much of which featured himself in both public and private situations. In Uday&#x27;s palace, a zoo with wild animals, hundreds of luxury cars, guns made from many brands of gold, hundreds of luxury alcohol brands, and hundreds of cigars with the name on it were found. At the Presidential Palace, in Uday&#x27;s dwellings, anti-depressants, an e-mail output that &quot;a virgin girl agrees to come to him,&quot; and another order asking for the girls to be examined for diseases were found. One of Uday&#x27;s private prisons was later disclosed, and it was stated that there was everyone who bothered Uday inside, the insiders were businessmen clashing with Uday, athletes who could not win, drivers who did not yield him the right of way, and some were thrown into the same cell with German shepherd dogs and left to die. Erotic pictures of women downloaded from the internet and pictures of American president Bush&#x27;s twin daughters Jenna and Barbara were found on the walls of Uday&#x27;s gym. In another house owned by Uday, &quot;pornographic pictures, heroin bags, expensive liqueurs, vintage cars and HIV testing&quot; was found. He was feeding lions and the other wild animals in his palace and often fed them with his own hands.

Abbas Al Janabi said: &quot;He has a large number of cars. He stole around 160 cars from Kuwait. You may not believe it when I tell you that &#x27;Uday has 1,300 luxury cars, such as Rolls Royces, Porsches, Ferraris, Range Rovers, Lincolns and others. Uday has prisons everywhere you go. He has two prisons in the presidential palace, a prison in the armory, a prison in the Olympic Committee, and a prison at his farm in the Radhwaniya compound.&quot; About his business, he said: &quot;He controls many facets of smuggling in Iraq—whisky, tobacco, fertilizers, petrol, and other goods. His business interests extend to Turkey, Iran, and Jordan. He has also gained control of all aid going to Iraq from the United Arab Emirates. He stores this aid in warehouses owned by the Olympic Committee and only distributes a small portion of it, always in front of the press. Uday then arranges for this aid to be sold in stores, and gets the proceeds. Uday is also one of the parties who controls the U.S. dollar/dinar exchange rate and the smuggling of dollars overseas. Because of the large number of U.S. dollars he has, he can affect the movement of the exchange rate at any given time to the benefit of his commercial operations.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Personal accounts state Uday grew up idolizing his father, Saddam Hussein, although their relationship later became strained due to his father&#x27;s many mistresses. Uday maintained a close cordial relationship with his mother, Sajida Talfah. The otherwise apathetic Uday, at his uncle Adnan Khairallah&#x27;s funeral in 1989, showed a rare moment of tenderness.

Uday married 3 times. In 1983, his father arranged for him to marry Nada, the daughter of Ali Hassan al-Majid. They had 2 sons but later divorced. While banished in Geneva, he married Saha, the teenaged daughter of his father&#x27;s half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti in July 1993 in a union arranged by his father. The marriage was never consummated and she deserted him 3 months later after she accused him of beating her during their marriage. She wrote a letter to him in 1996 professing her love despite this. He later married Suja, the daughter of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who had a son with him, although she alleged that he treated her badly.

After being handicapped by the assassination attempt on him in 1996, he maintained distance from Qusay who was rising in ranks and thought to be Saddam&#x27;s next legitimate successor. Uday was 6feet 6inches tall and athletically built, though after the assassination attempt, he was partially paralyzed and would eventually use a wheelchair in private and a walking cane in public.

His longtime secretary Abbas al Janabi said: About the relationship with his brothers Janabi said in 1999: &quot;Saddam has one son, Ali, from Samira Shahbandar. He is thirteen years old. He is a member of the board of an athletic club. He is treated in a special manner by his father, with many servants and bodyguards. The press does not focus on Ali because Uday does not want him to have any public role. Even though he is a director of the largest athletic club in Baghdad, Uday refuses to have any publicity surrounding his role. Uday hates him. Uday cannot tolerate his [younger full] brother Qusay, let alone Ali.&quot; About his personality, he said: &quot;Uday was a complex personality. It has to do with his upbringing. Saddam personally took charge of bringing up his younger brother Qusay. Although Saddam also participated in bringing up Uday, he did not devote so much attention to him. It was Uday&#x27;s mother and her father [Khayrallah Tulfa, Saddam&#x27;s maternal uncle] who had the most influence on him. This is why we see Khayrallah Tulfa&#x27;s known traits in Uday, such as the love of money, the love for taking over other people&#x27;s property, violence and extremism. Uday obviously has some of his father&#x27;s traits as well, but it is his maternal grandfather that seems to have influenced him as well.&quot;

In a sign of loyalty to Saddam, the Vice-president of the Revolutionary Command Council Izzat al-Douri consented to marry his daughter Hawazin to Uday. However, al-Douri&#x27;s influence with Saddam was so substantial that he was able to levy a condition: that the union would not be consummated. Because of Uday&#x27;s violent and erratic behavior, al-Douri quickly petitioned that his daughter be permitted to divorce Uday. Uday reportedly had no children from his marriage. His third marriage was with Saja al-Tikriti, daughter of his step-uncle Barzan İbrahim al-Tikriti; that marriage soon ended as well, beginning with Saja&#x27;s refusal to return to Iraq after going to Switzerland. Saja&#x27;s brother said about the reason of divorce, &quot;Uday did not beat my sister black and blue but treated her like a princess. My sister was only 16, and had different ideas about marriage. That&#x27;s why they separated soon after the wedding.&quot; Dr. Alaa Bashir said: &quot;Four days after the wedding, Uday was accompanied by a number of prostitutes in a suite at the Rasheed Hotel, which led to a new scandal in Baghdad. Saja went out to Sajida&#x27;s house because her parents were in Geneva and tried unsuccessfully to persuade her uncle to agree to divorce her, but the president refused and asked her to talk to Uday about that. Uday refused to talk about the issue of divorce and told her: &#x27;Our family does not know about divorce.&#x27;&quot; It was alleged that Uday&#x27;s first marriage was to the daughter of Saddam&#x27;s cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid. A Turkish woman named Sevim Torun claimed that she was married to Uday and had a son named Mesut Uday and published her memoir &quot;Saddam&#x27;s Bride&quot;.

Uday was reported to have converted to Shia Islam from Sunni Islam in 2001, but he denied these reports. 

== Allegations of crimes ==
In November 1987, Latif said, &quot;I saw many rapes. He raped and killed women, and then killed her parents if they complained. I witnessed many murders. Uday had raped one of the Baghdad Beauty Queens and her father complained to Saddam. He ordered me to kill him. I refused and instead cut my wrists.&quot;

A report released on 20 March 2003, one day after the American led invasion of Iraq, by ABC News detailed several allegations against Uday:
* As head of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, Uday oversaw the imprisonment and torture of Iraqi athletes who were deemed not to have performed to expectations. He would insult athletes who performed below his expectations by calling them dogs and monkeys to their faces. One defector reported that imprisoned football players were forced to kick a concrete ball after failing to reach the 1994 FIFA World Cup finals. The Iraqi national football team were seen with their heads shaved after failing to achieve a good result in a tournament in the 1980s. Another defector claimed that athletes were dragged through a gravel pit and then immersed in a sewage tank to induce infection in their wounds. After Iraq lost 4–1 to Japan in the quarter-finals of the 2000 AFC Asian Cup in Lebanon, goalkeeper Hashim Khamis, defender Abdul-Jabar Hashim and forward Qahtan Chathir were labelled as guilty of loss and eventually flogged for three days by Uday&#x27;s security.

Other allegations include:

* Uday was known to intrude on parties and otherwise &quot;discover&quot; women whom he would later rape. &quot;Time&quot; published an article in 2003 detailing his sexual brutality.
* Usage of an iron maiden on persons who fell foul of him.
* Beating an army officer unconscious when the man refused to allow Uday to dance with his wife; the man later died of his injuries. Uday also shot and killed an army officer who did not salute him.
* Stealing approximately 1,200 luxury cars, including a Rolls-Royce Corniche valued at over $200,000.
* Plotting, in 2000, to assassinate Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi National Congress. This was done shortly after Saddam named his younger son, Qusay, heir-apparent to the presidency. Uday allegedly intended to curry favour with his father through the assassination.

== Statements before 2003 ==
In July 2002, the Iraqi newspaper &quot;Babel&quot;, owned by Uday Hussein, published an article by &quot;Abu Hatim&quot; (an alias used by Uday) which claimed that the American administration was planning to strike Iraq and exert political control in the Middle East. It stated the plans &quot;will extend to include everything&quot;, &quot;starting from making Jordan an alternative homeland for the Palestinians, &quot;dividing Saudi Arabia into at least three parts and obliterating Bahrain&#x27;s identity by returning it as part of Persia.

In September 2002, Uday threatened that &quot;the heads of the Americans, the British and others will fly if they try to approach the borders of Iraq, with the aim of invading it.&quot; During his meeting with a number of delegations of Arab youth, Uday claimed the Americans who are now allied with them are &quot;Saddam Hussein and his family.&quot; He added, &quot;This is the pride of the family. Uday and Qusay said that it is God&#x27;s will ... In any case, that is better than targeting the infrastructure and sabotaging the electricity, water, communications and other networks. Uday considered that the undeclared goal of the American war against Iraq is to control Iraq&#x27;s oil and reserves, which he said is &quot;number one in the world, and they do not say it, they do not say that the war is for oil.&quot; He added that the last barrel of oil &quot;on the face of the Earth ... will be a barrel of Iraqi oil. They (the Americans) separated Northern Iraqi in this damned way, because the north has uranium, gold and other materials in it.&quot;

Uday responded to the accusations of British Prime Minister Tony Blair against Iraq, that the latter &quot;if his hands and feet were wrapped and put on a bear, he would have nodded evil with his head, and even if he put his head between the jaws of iron and wood pincers and squeezed the head between the jaws of the pincers, his eyes would still move and gesture to evil.&quot; Uday stressed the &quot;strength&quot; of the home front, and that &quot;the enemy will meet what it does, if he tries to harm Iraq.&quot; 

== Death ==

During the 2003 Iraq War, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s closest aide and personal secretary, Abid Hamid Mahmud, had been captured, and told his interrogators that he and Saddam&#x27;s two sons had sought refuge in Syria but were turned back.

On the night of 21 July 2003, Nawaf al-Zaidan, who had been sheltering Uday, Qusay, Mustafa and their bodyguard Abdul-Samad in his mansion in the Falah neighbourhood of northeastern Mosul, left the villa and went to a nearby 101st Airborne base to turn in the two sons due to the combined $30 million reward. &quot;He was nervous, I could tell, more nervous than anybody else I&#x27;ve seen dealing with it. Yet he had confidence in what he said. More than most of the other people,&quot; the 23-year-old American military intelligence sergeant who interviewed al-Zaidan told &quot;60 Minutes II&quot;. &quot;He had exact locations. He also could tell very good descriptions on Qusay and Uday as well, their habits. He told me what exactly they looked like.&quot; Al-Zaidan then passed a lie detector test, which was interpreted as a definitive validation of his story.

On the morning of 22 July 2003, JSOC Task Force 20, aided by troops of the United States Army 101st Airborne Division, surrounded Uday, Qusay, and Qusay&#x27;s 14-year-old son Mustafa during a raid on a home in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. Acting on a tip from al-Zaidan, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division provided security while the Task Force 20 operators tried to capture the inhabitants of the house. As many as 200 American troops, later aided by OH-58 Kiowa helicopters, surrounded and fired upon the house, killing Uday, Qusay, and Qusay&#x27;s son. After approximately five hours of battle, soldiers entered the house and found four bodies, including the Hussein brothers&#x27; bodyguard.

Soldiers, who tried to enter the house three times, encountered resistance with AK-47 and grenades in the first two attempts. Uday, Qusay, and the guard took up positions in a bathroom at the front of the building, where they had a line of fire on the streets and on steps leading up to the first floor; Qusay&#x27;s son took cover in the bedroom in the back and defended himself. The American forces then bombed the house many times and fired missiles. The three adults were thought to have died from a TOW missile fired into the front of the house. In the third attempt, the soldiers killed Mustafa after he fired. Mustafa had been the last one to die in the five-hour siege and kept shooting even after Qusay and Uday had been killed, US military officials said. 

Brigade commander Colonel Joe Anderson said an Arabic announcement was made at 10:00a.m. on the day and called on people inside to come out peacefully. The answer he received was bullet bombardment. An experienced team of special forces tried to attack the building, but they had to retreat under fire. Four American soldiers were injured. Anderson then ordered his men to fire with 50-caliber heavy machine guns. Uday and Qusay refused to surrender even after a helicopter fired a rocket and the Strike Brigade fired 40 mm grenades at them. Anderson decided that more firepower was necessary to take down the brothers, leading to 12 TOW missiles being fired into the building.

Later, the American command said that dental records had conclusively identified two of the dead men as Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sons. They also announced that the informant would receive the combined $30 million reward previously offered for their apprehension.

According to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s memories, when he learned about the death of his sons and grandson, the first thing he said was, &quot;Did they fight?&quot; When he got the answer &quot;Yes&quot;, then he said, &quot;Good! Praise be to God, who honored me with their martyrdom and defense of their homeland.&quot; 

After his sons&#x27; deaths, Saddam Hussein recorded a tape and said, During Saddam&#x27;s interrogation, when George Piro started asking questions about Uday, Piro said, &quot;I was surprised. He didn&#x27;t show any remorse (about his son&#x27;s death). He told me that he was, of course, proud of his sons. They died believing, or fighting, for what they believed. I pressed him until Saddam didn&#x27;t want to hear anymore (the rumors about Uday). He tells me to stop. Basically stop asking these questions. You don&#x27;t get to pick your kids. You&#x27;re kind of stuck with what you get.&quot; During a different interrogation, when CIA analyst John Nixon confronted Saddam with the rumor that he and Samira had a son named Ali, Saddam painfully said, &quot;If I told you yes, would you kill him like you killed Uday and Qusay?&quot; Saddam also told Nixon he had learned of his sons&#x27; deaths through BBC radio.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; claimed that the contents of Uday Hussein&#x27;s briefcase consisted of Viagra, numerous bottles of cologne, unopened packages of men&#x27;s underwear, dress shirts, a silk tie and a single condom. The money found with the former Iraqi leader&#x27;s sons was more than three times the $30 million bounty on their heads by the US Government. They had about $100 million in Iraqi dinars and US dollars. Some claimed Nawaf al-Zaidan, who owned the villa where the men were hiding, had tipped off the Americans to their presence after reportedly sheltering them for 23 days. 

The others claimed that Uday and Qusay were tracked down after Uday made a telephone call to an associate that was tracked by the US Central Intelligence Agency. Then the brother of Nawaf, Salah al-Zaidan, was shot dead by gunmen while Nawaf was thought to have fled Iraq. According to a former bodyguard for Uday Hussein, after the fall of Baghdad, they planned a guerrilla resistance and Saddam and his sons lived separately in Baghdad after the American occupation, changing houses every two or three days. But Uday continued to drive through the city in nondescript vehicles, and always with a machine pistol, according to the bodyguard. He said Saddam and his sons had been moving freely around Baghdad, often with astonishingly little effort to hide themselves during the war. 

At one stage, Uday had driven past a convoy of US soldiers, looking at their faces and quietly insulting the men who now controlled his country. During the war, Uday forsook the alcohol and womanising and concentrated his energies on directing the Fedayeen Saddam.

The U.S. Administration released graphic pictures of the Hussein brothers&#x27; bodies. Both brothers had grown long beards to avoid detection, with Uday shaving his head. Afterwards, their bodies were reconstructed by morticians to assure the public that they were deceased. For example, Uday&#x27;s beard was trimmed and an 8-inch metal bar in his leg from the 1996 assassination attempt was removed. When criticized, the U.S. military&#x27;s response was to point out that these men were no ordinary combatants, and to express hope that confirmation of the deaths would bring closure to the Iraqi people. Uday is buried in a cemetery in his hometown of Al-Awja near Tikrit, alongside Qusay and Mustafa. In 2017, his son Massoud claimed that the Iranian government stole his body although this was unproven.

== In film, television, and theatre ==
Philip Arditti portrayed Uday in the docudrama television miniseries &quot;House of Saddam&quot;. He and Latif were portrayed by Dominic Cooper in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Double&quot;, based on Latif&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;I was Saddam&#x27;s Son&quot;, but according to Latif had only been &quot;20% of the truth&quot;. Hrach Titizian portrayed him in the play &quot;Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.&quot; Sam Vincenti portrayed him in the &quot;Locked Up Abroad&quot; TV-series, in the 2013 episode &quot;Son of Saddam&quot;.

In the 1999 movie &quot;Deterrence&quot;, Uday is depicted as Saddam&#x27;s successor. A reference to Uday is made on the American &quot;The Office&quot; TV series, in the 2011 episode “Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager”.

Uday is referenced in the 2003 season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, where a Saddam Hussein lookalike exclaims that “I am behaving like an Uday lookalike.”

Uday and Qusay are referenced during a sketch in &quot;The Eric Andre Show&quot;&#x27;s 2020 episode, &quot;The 50th Episode!&quot;.

<doc id="197982" wikidata="Q946676" url="?curid=197982" title="Straight engine">
<text>The straight engine (also called inline engine) is a configuration of multi-cylinder piston engine where all of the cylinders are arranged in a single row, rather than radially or in two or more cylinder banks.

== Design ==
A straight engine is easier to build than an equivalent flat engine or V engine, as it uses one cylinder head rather than two. Inline engines are also narrower than flat engines or V engines; however, they are longer and can be taller.

The engine balance characteristics of a straight engine depend on the number of cylinders and the firing interval.

=== Slant engines and horizontally-mounted engines ===
When a straight engine is mounted at an angle from the vertical it is called a &quot;slant engine&quot;. Notable slant engines include the 1959-2000 Chrysler Slant-6 engine, 1961-63 Pontiac Trophy 4 engine and the 1968-1981 Triumph Slant-4 engine.

Some buses and diesel multiple unit trains take this concept further by mounting the engines horizontally (i.e. with a slant angle of 90 degrees). This is used to reduce the height of the engine, so that it can be located under the floor of the train or bus.

=== Number of cylinders ===

* I-twin (also known as &quot;I2&quot;)
* I3
* I4
* I5
* I6
* I7
* I8
* I9
* I12
* I14
== Usage in automobiles ==
The straight-three and straight-four configurations are the most common layouts for three- and four-cylinder engines respectively. Straight-five engines are occasionally used, most recently by Audi and Volvo. Straight-six engines were common prior to the 1990s, however most six-cylinder engines now use a V6 layout. Similarly, straight-eight engines were popular in the 1920s to 1940s, however they were replaced by the more compact V8 layout. 

==Aviation use==
Many straight engines have been produced for aircraft, particularly from the early years of aviation and through the interwar period leading up to the Second World War. Straight engines were simpler and had low frontal area, reducing drag, and provided better cockpit visibility.

Straight sixes were especially popular in the First World War, and most German and Italian and some British aircraft used descendants of Daimler&#x27;s pre-war inline six. Prominent examples include the German Mercedes D.III and BMW IIIa, Italian Isotta Fraschini V.4 and British Siddeley Puma.

The British de Havilland Gipsy family of engines and their descendants included straight-four and straight-six upright and inverted air-cooled engines which were used on a wide range of smaller aircraft around the world, including on the Tiger Moth biplane, and helped made the configuration popular for light aircraft. Menasco and Fairchild-Ranger in the United States, Renault in France, Walter in Czechoslovakia, and Hirth in Germany all built a similar range of engines which were popular in their respective markets.

The aviation use of term &quot;inline engine&quot; is used more broadly than for straight engines, since it also applies to other configurations where the cylinders are located in rows (e.g. V engines, W engines, H engines and horizontally opposed engines).

=== Inverted engines ===

Some straight aircraft engines have used an &quot;inverted engine&quot; configuration, whereby the crankshaft is at the top of the engine and the pistons hang downwards from it. Advantages of the inverted arrangement include a raised thrust line for improved clearance for the propeller, which either allows for the use of a larger, more efficient propeller, or for shorter undercarriage. Since the thrust line is higher, the engine can be mounted lower in the airframe, improving visibility forward, which is no longer blocked by the cylinder heads. It also allows for a simpler exhaust to keep gasses clear from the cockpit.

==Motorcycle use==

In motorcycling, the term &quot;in-line&quot; is sometimes used narrowly, for a straight engine mounted in line with the frame. straight, and inline as equivalent, and use them interchangeably.

<doc id="197983" wikidata="Q38484" url="?curid=197983" title="Romano Prodi">
<text>Romano Prodi (; born 9 August 1939) is an Italian politician who served as President of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004 and twice as Prime Minister of Italy, from 1996 to 1998, and again from 2006 to 2008. Prodi is considered the founder of the Italian centre-left and one of the most prominent figures of the Second Republic. He is often nicknamed &quot;Il Professore&quot; (&quot;The Professor&quot;) due to his academic career.

A former professor of economics and international advisor to Goldman Sachs, Prodi ran as lead candidate of The Olive Tree coalition, winning the 1996 election and serving as prime minister until losing a vote of confidence 1998. He was subsequently appointed President of the European Commission in 1999, serving until 2004. Following the victory of his new coalition, The Union, over the House of Freedoms led by Silvio Berlusconi, at the 2006 election, Prodi became prime minister a second time. On 24 January 2008, he lost a vote of confidence in the Senate and consequently tendered his resignation as prime minister to President Giorgio Napolitano; he continued in office for almost four months for routine business until early elections were held and a new government was formed. Prodi was the first left-leaning candidate to finish first in an Italian general election since 1921.

On 14 October 2007, Prodi became the founding president of the Democratic Party upon foundation of the party. On 12 September 2008, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon selected Prodi as president of the African Union–United Nations peacekeeping panel. Since 2021, he is serving as the United Nations Special Envoy for the Sahel.

==Early life and family==
Prodi was born in Scandiano, near Reggio Emilia, in 1939; he is the eighth of nine children. His father, Mario Prodi, was an engineer grown up in a peasant family, and his mother, Enrichetta, was an elementary school teacher. Most of the brothers are, or have been, university professors, among them Giovanni Prodi (professor of mathematical analysis), Vittorio Prodi (professor of physics and member of the European Parliament), Paolo Prodi (professor of modern history), (professor of atmospheric physics), and Giorgio Prodi (professor of general pathology).

In 1969, Prodi married Flavia Franzoni, at that time a student, who later became an economist and university professor. The couple was married by Camillo Ruini, now a well-known cardinal. They have two sons, Giorgio and Antonio. His wife Flavia died on 13 June 2023, at the age of 76.

==Academic career==
After completing his secondary education at the &quot;Liceo Ludovico Ariosto&quot; in Reggio Emilia, Prodi graduated in law at Milan&#x27;s Università Cattolica in 1961 with a thesis on the role of protectionism in the development of Italian industry. He then carried out postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.

Prodi has received almost 20 honorary degrees from institutions in Italy, and from the rest of Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa.

==Early political career==
===Ministry of Industry and Aldo Moro&#x27;s kidnapping===

On 25 November 1978, Prodi was appointed Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Crafts in the government of the Christian Democracy leader Giulio Andreotti. Even if he was a party member, Prodi was widely considered a technical minister. As minister, he promoted a law, known as Prodi law, which aimed a regulating of the extraordinary state administration procedure for the rescue of large enterprises in crisis.

On 2 April 1978, Prodi and other teachers at the University of Bologna passed on a tip-off that revealed the whereabouts of the safe house where the kidnapped Aldo Moro, the former prime minister, was being held captive by the Red Brigades. Prodi stated that he had been given this tip-off by the founders of Christian Democracy, contacted from beyond the grave via a séance and a Ouija board. Whilst during this supposed séance Prodi thought &quot;Gradoli&quot; referred to a town on the outskirts of Rome, it probably referred to the Roman address of a Red Brigades safe house, located at no. 96, Via Gradoli.

The information was trusted and a police group made an armed blitz in the town of Gradoli, 80 km from Rome, on the following day, 6 April, although Moro was not found. The supernatural element was generally not overlooked during the investigations. For example, the Italian government had engaged a diviner, hoping that he would find Moro&#x27;s location. The police made another fruitless blitz in Viterbo after an abbess declared that, during a vision, she had seen him there.

Prodi spoke to the Italian Parliament&#x27;s commission about the case in 1981. In the notes of the Italian Parliament commission on terrorism, the séance is described as a fake, used to hide the true source of the information. In 1997, Andreotti declared that the information came from the Bologna section of Autonomia Operaia, a far-left organization with some ties with the Red Brigades, and that Francesco Cossiga also knew the true source. Judge Ferdinando Imposimato considered Andreotti&#x27;s theory as possible but accused him of having kept information that could have been valuable in a trial about Moro&#x27;s murder. Moro&#x27;s widow later declared that she had repeatedly informed the police that a Via Gradoli existed in Rome, but the investigators did not consider it; some replied to her that the street did not appear in Rome&#x27;s maps. This is confirmed by other Moro relatives but strongly denied by Cossiga, who served as Interior Minister during Moro&#x27;s kidnapping.

===Mitrokhin Commission===
In the 1990s, the séance matter was reopened by the Italian Parliament&#x27;s commission on terrorism. While Prodi (then Prime Minister) declared that he had no time for an interview, both Mario Baldassarri (senator and vice-minister in two Silvio Berlusconi cabinets) and Alberto Clò (Minister of Industry in Lamberto Dini&#x27;s cabinet and owner of the house where the séance was performed) responded to the call; they confirmed the circumstances of the séance, and that &quot;Gradoli&quot; had appeared in several sessions, even if the participants had changed. Later, other Italian members of the European Commission alleged that Prodi had invented this story to conceal the real source of the tip-off, which they believed to have originated somewhere among the far-left Italian political groups.

This issue came back again in 2005, when Prodi was accused of being &quot;a KGB man&quot; by Mario Scaramella. The allegations were rejected by Prodi. Former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer Alexander Litvinenko also said that FSB deputy chief Anatoly Trofimov &quot;did not exactly say that Prodi was a KGB agent, because the KGB avoids using that word.&quot; The same accusation was raised in 2002 by the Mitrokhin Commission, which was closed in 2006 with a majority and a minority report, without reaching shared conclusions, and without any concrete evidence given to support the original allegations of KGB ties to Italian politicians contained in the Mitrokhin Archive. Led by the centre-right coalition majority, it was criticized as politically motivated, as it was focused mainly on allegations against opposition figures. 2006 saw the publication of telephone interceptions between the chairman of the Mitrokhin Commission, Forza Italia senator Paolo Guzzanti, and Scaramella. In the wiretaps, Guzzanti made it clear that the true intent of the Mitrokhin Commission was to support the hypothesis that Prodi would have been an agent financed or in any case manipulated by Moscow and the KGB. According to the opposition, which submitted its own minority report, this hypothesis was false, and the purpose of the commission was therefore to discredit him. In the wiretaps, Scaramella had the task of collecting testimonies from some ex-agents of the Soviet secret service refugees in Europe to support these accusations; he was later charged for calumny.

In November 2006, the new Italian Parliament with a centre-left coalition majority instituted a commission to investigate the Mitrokhin Commission for allegations that it was manipulated for political purposes. In a December 2006 interview given to the television program &quot;La storia siamo noi&quot;, colonel ex-KGB agent Oleg Gordievsky, whom Scaramella claimed as his source, confirmed the accusations made against Scaramella regarding the production of false material relating to Prodi and other Italian politicians, and underlined their lack of reliability. Despite this, those claims were further repeated by the UK Independence Party&#x27;s Gerard Batten, the member of the European Parliament for London who stated that he was informed of this by Litvinenko, who was his constituent and former FSB operative. The 16 February 2018 indictment of Paul Manafort unsealed on 23 February, as part of the Mueller special counsel investigation, alleges that foreign politicians hypothesized to be Prodi and Alfred Gusenbauer took payments exceeding $2 million from Manafort to promote the case of his client, Viktor Yanukovich; both denied this and said their work was focused to get closer European Union–Ukraine relations.

==Business and administrative career==
After leaving his position in 1989, Prodi ran the Bologna based consulting company &quot;Analisi e Studi Economici&quot;, which he jointly owned along with his wife. Between 1990 and 1993 the company earned £1.4 million, most of which was paid by the investment bank Goldman Sachs.

===Second term as IRI President===
In 1993, Prodi was between the main candidates to become Prime Minister of Italy at the head of a technocratic government; instead, the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was chosen for this office by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

In 1993–1994, Prodi was appointed again President of the IRI, by Ciampi, where he oversaw extensive privatization of public assets. For his activities in this period Prodi would later twice come under investigation – firstly for an alleged conflict of interest in relation to contracts awarded to his own economic research company in relation to the Italdel-Siemens merger, and secondly concerning the sale of the loss-making state-owned food conglomerate SME to the multinational Unilever, for which he had previously been a paid consultant.

Prodi&#x27;s former employer Goldman Sachs was involved in both of the deals. In February 2007 the Italian Treasury Police raided the Milan office of Goldman Sachs, where they removed a file called &quot;MTononi/memo-Prodi02.doc&quot;. They also obtained a letter to Siemens from the Frankfurt office of Goldman Sachs regarding the Italdel deal, which revealed that Prodi was made the Senior Advisor of Goldman Sachs International in Italy in March 1990. In November 1996, after Prodi had been elected prime minister, Rome prosecutor Guiseppa Geremia concluded that there was enough evidence to press charges against Prodi for conflict of interest in the Unilever deal. The case was however shut down within weeks by superiors, while Geremia was &quot;exiled to Sardinia&quot;.

==First term as Prime Minister (1996–1998)==
On 25 May 1994, Prodi went to Palazzo Chigi to announce his resignation as IRI President to the new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi; the resignation had been formalised on 31 May and became effective on 22 July.

On 11 August, Prodi announced to the &quot;Gazzetta di Reggio&quot; of his intent to enter politics. A few months earlier, Prodi had rejected a proposal from the Italian People&#x27;s Party (PPI) to run for the 1994 European election.

===The Olive Tree and 1996 election===
On 13 February 1995 Prodi, along with his close friend Arturo Parisi, founded his political alliance The Olive Tree. Prodi&#x27;s aim was to build a centre-left coalition composed by centrist and leftist parties, opposed to the centre-right alliance led by Silvio Berlusconi, who resigned from the office of prime minister few weeks before, when Lega Nord withdrew his support to the government. The movement was immediately supported by Mariotto Segni, leader of the centrist Segni Pact; after few weeks the post-communist Democratic Party of the Left of Massimo D&#x27;Alema, the PPI and the Federation of the Greens also joined the Olive Tree coalition.

On 19 February 1996, the outgoing Prime Minister Lamberto Dini announced that he would run in the election with a new party called Italian Renewal, allied with Prodi&#x27;s Olive Tree rather than Berlusconi&#x27;s Pole for Freedoms. Shortly after Berlusconi claimed that Dini &quot;copied his electoral programme&quot;.

On election day, Prodi&#x27;s Olive Tree coalition won over Berlusconi&#x27;s Pole for Freedoms, becoming the first coalition composed of a post-communist party to win a general election since the Second World War. In the Senate, The Olive Tree obtained the majority; in the Chamber, it required the external support of Communist Refoundation Party. On 17 May 1996, Prodi received from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro the task of forming a new government. He ultimately formed a 23-member cabinet that included 16 PDS ministers (including Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni) and 10 PDS junior ministers–the first (former) Communists to take part in government in half a century.

===Policies===
Prodi&#x27;s economic programme consisted in continuing the past governments&#x27; work of restoration of the country&#x27;s economic health, in order to pursue the then seemingly unreachable goal of leading the country within the strict European Monetary System parameters in order to allow the country to join the Euro currency. He succeeded in this in little more than six months.

During his first premiership, Prodi faced the 1997 Albanian civil unrest; his government proposed the so-called Operation Alba (&quot;Sunrise&quot;), a multinational peacekeeping force sent to Albania in 1997 and led by Italy. It was intended to help the Albanian government restore law and order in their troubled country after the 1997 rebellion in Albania.
Following the degenerating loss of administrative control by the Government in the first days of March 1997, culminating in the desertion of most Police and many Republican Guard and Army units, leaving their armouries open to the inevitable looting which soon followed, several Nations autonomously helped evacuate their Nationals in Operation Silver Wake and Operation Libelle.

The UN Security Council therefore agreed the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1101 as a stop-gap operation to manage this and buy time, laying the foundations for a planned reconstruction, which after six weeks of debate fell to the Western European Union, creating the Multinational Albanian Police Element around a command structure of Italian Carabinieri, which actually undertook the work of Judicial and Police reconstruction, extending into the elimination of the economic causes of the crisis.

The Italian 3rd Army Corps assumed responsibility for the stop-gap mission as Operation Alba, the first multinational Italian-led Mission since World War II. Eleven contributing European Nations brought humanitarian aid to a country that was in a dramatic economic and political situation. In 1997, Prodi declared that &quot;the problem of the safety of the country seems to be no longer one of external safety, but an internal one: the safety of citizens in their everyday life&quot;.

===Resignation===
Prodi&#x27;s government fell in 1998 when the Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its external support. This led to the formation of a new government led by Massimo D&#x27;Alema as prime minister. There are those who claim that D&#x27;Alema, along with People&#x27;s Party leader Franco Marini, deliberately engineered the collapse of the Prodi government to become prime minister himself. As the result of a vote of no confidence in Prodi&#x27;s government, D&#x27;Alema&#x27;s nomination was passed by a single vote. This was the first occasion in the history of the Italian Republic on which a vote of no confidence had ever been called; the Republic&#x27;s many previous governments had been brought down by a majority &quot;no&quot; vote on some crucially important piece of legislation (such as the budget).

==President of the European Commission (1999–2004)==
In September 1999 Prodi, a strong supporter of European Integration, became President of the European Commission, thanks to the support of both the conservative European People&#x27;s Party, the social-democratic Party of European Socialists and the centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party in the European Parliament.

His commission took office on 13 September 1999 following the scandal and subsequent resignation of the Santer Commission which had damaged the reputation of the institution. It took over from the interim Marín Commission. The College consisted of 20 Commissioners which grew to 30 following the Enlargement of the European Union in 2004. It was the last commission to see two members allocated to the larger member states. This commission (the 10th) saw in increase in power and influence following Amsterdam Treaty. Some in the media described president Prodi as being the first &quot;Prime Minister of the European Union&quot;.

===Amsterdam Treaty===
It was during Prodi&#x27;s presidency, in 2002, that 11 EU member states ditched their national currencies and adopted the euro as their common currency. This commission (the 10th) saw an increase in power and influence following the Amsterdam Treaty.

The treaty was the result of long negotiations which began in Messina, Sicily, on 2 June 1995, nearly forty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and reached completion in Amsterdam on 18 June 1997. Following the formal signing of the Treaty on 2 October 1997, the member states engaged in an equally long and complex ratification process. The European Parliament endorsed the treaty on 19 November 1997, and after two referendums and 13 decisions by parliaments, the member states finally concluded the procedure. Under this treaty the member states agreed to devolve certain powers from national governments to the European Parliament across diverse areas, including legislating on immigration, adopting civil and criminal laws, and enacting foreign and security policy (CFSP), as well as implementing institutional changes for expansion as new member nations join the EU.

Due to this increased power of the Commission President, some media described President Prodi as being the first &quot;Prime Minister of the European Union&quot;.

===Nice Treaty===
 


As well as the enlargement and Amsterdam Treaty, the Prodi Commission also saw the signing and enforcement of the Treaty of Nice as well as the conclusion and signing of the European Constitution: in which he introduced the &quot;Convention method&quot; of negotiation. The treaty was signed by European leaders on 26 February 2001 and came into force on 1 February 2003.

It amended the Maastricht Treaty (or the Treaty on European Union) and the Treaty of Rome (or the Treaty establishing the European Community which, before the Maastricht Treaty, was the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community). The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion, a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty, but failed to be addressed at the time. The entry into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time, after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later.

===2004 enlargement and end of the mandate=== 

In 2004, his last year as Commission President, the European Union was enlarged to admit several more member nations, most formerly part of the Soviet bloc. It was the largest single expansion of the European Union (EU), in terms of territory, number of states, and population to date; however, it was not the largest in terms of gross domestic product. It occurred on 1 May 2004.

The simultaneous accessions concerned the following countries (sometimes referred to as the &quot;A10&quot; countries): Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Seven of these were part of the former Eastern Bloc (of which three were from the former Soviet Union and four were and still are members of the Central European alliance Visegrád Group), one of the former Yugoslavia (together sometimes referred to as the &quot;A8&quot; countries), and the remaining two were Mediterranean islands and former British colonies.

Part of the same wave was the 2007 enlargement of the European Union that saw accession of Bulgaria and Romania, who were unable to join in 2004, but, according to the Commission, constitute part of the fifth enlargement. The commission was due to leave office on 31 October 2004, but due to opposition from the European Parliament to the proposed Barroso Commission which would succeed it, it was extended and finally left office on 21 November 2004. When his mandate expired, Prodi returned to domestic politics.

==Return to Italian politics (2005–2006)==
===The Union primary election===

Shortly before the end of his term as President of the European Commission, Prodi returned to national Italian politics at the helm of the enlarged centre-left coalition, The Union.
Having no party of his own, in order to officially state his candidacy for the 2006 general election, Prodi came up with the idea of an apposite primary election, the first of such kind to be ever introduced in Europe and seen by its creator (Prodi himself) as a democratic move to bring the public and its opinion closer to the Italian politics.

When the primary elections were first proposed, they were mostly meant as a plebiscite for Romano Prodi, since there were no other candidates for the leadership of the coalition. The secretary of the Communist Refoundation Party, Fausto Bertinotti, then announced he would run for the leadership, even if only to act as a symbolic candidate, to avoid a one-candidate election. After some time, more candidates were presented, like Union of Democrats for Europe leader Clemente Mastella, Italy of Values leader and former magistrate Antonio Di Pietro, Federation of the Greens leader Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio and others few minor candidates.

The primary election may have been foreseen an easy win for Romano Prodi, with the other candidates running mostly to &quot;measure their strengths&quot; in the coalition, and they often talked about reaching a certain percentage rather than winning. However, there were rumours of supporters of the House of Freedoms trying to participate in the elections, and vote in favour of Mastella, reputed to be the least competent of the candidates and the least likely to win against Berlusconi, other than the most centrist; other rumours indicated such &quot;fake&quot; left-wing voters would vote for Bertinotti, because his leadership would likely lose any grip on the political centre.

The election had been held nationwide on 16 October 2005, from 8 am to 10 pm. Poll stations were mainly managed on a voluntary basis; they were hosted mainly in squares, local party quarters, schools, and even restaurants, bars, campers and a hairdresser; some polling stations were also provided outside the country for Italians abroad. Most of the party leaders claimed a result of 1 million voters would be a good success for the election, but over four million people for the occasion went to cast a vote in the primary election.

==Second term as Prime Minister (2006–2008)==
===Italian 2006 general election===
After having won the centre-left primary election, Prodi led The Union coalition in the 2006 election. The Union was a heterogeneous alliance, which was formed by centrist parties like UDEUR and communists like PRC and Party of Italian Communists.

Prodi led his coalition to the electoral campaign preceding the election, eventually on 9 and 10 April won by a very narrow margin of 25,000 votes, and a final majority of two seats in the Senate. Initial exit polls suggested a victory for Prodi, but the results narrowed as the count progressed. On 11 April 2006, Prodi declared victory; Berlusconi never conceded defeat explicitly but this is not required by the Italian law.

Preliminary results showed The Union leading the House of Freedoms in the Chamber of Deputies, with 340 seats to 277, thanks to obtaining a majority bonus (actual votes were distributed 49.81% to 49.74%). One more seat is allied with The Union (Aosta Valley) and 7 more seats in the foreign constituency. The House of Freedoms had secured a slight majority of Senate seats elected within Italy (155 seats to 154), but The Union won 4 of the 6 seats allocated to voters outside Italy, giving them control of both chambers.

On 19 April 2006, Italy&#x27;s Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that Prodi had indeed won the election, winning control of the Chamber of Deputies by only 24,755 votes out of more than 38 million votes cast, and winning 158 seats in the Senate to 156 for Berlusconi&#x27;s coalition. Even so, Berlusconi refused to concede defeat, claiming unproven fraud.

===Government formation===
Prodi&#x27;s appointment was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing president of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, ended his mandate in May, not having enough time for the usual procedure (consultations made by the president, appointment of a prime minister, the motion of confidence and oath of office). After the acrimonious election of Giorgio Napolitano to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On 16 May he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, 17 May 2006, Prodi and his second cabinet were sworn into office.

Prodi&#x27;s new cabinet drew in politicians from across his centre-left winning coalition, in addition to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, an unelected former official of the European Central Bank with no partisan membership. Romano Prodi obtained the support for his cabinet on 19 May at the Senate and on 23 May at the Chamber of Deputies.

The coalition led by Prodi, thanks to the electoral law which gave the winner a sixty-seat majority, can count on a good majority in the Chamber of Deputies but only on a very narrow majority in the Senate. The composition of the coalition was heterogeneous, combining parties of communist ideology, the Party of Italian Communists and Communist Refoundation Party, within the same government as parties of Catholic inspiration, Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy and UDEUR. The latter was led by Clemente Mastella, former chairman of Christian Democracy. Therefore, according to critics, it was difficult to have a single policy in different key areas, such as economics and foreign politics (for instance, Italian military presence in Afghanistan).

===Foreign policy===

In foreign policy, the Prodi II Cabinet continued the engagement in Afghanistan, under UN command, while withdrawing troops from post-invasion Iraq on 18 May 2006, when Prodi laid out some sense of his new foreign policy, pledging to withdraw Italian troops from Iraq and called the Iraq War a &quot;grave mistake that has not solved but increased the problem of security&quot;.

The major effort of foreign minister Massimo D&#x27;Alema concerned the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon War, being the first to offer troops to the UN for the constitution of the UNIFIL force, and assuming its command in February 2007. In fact, Prodi had a key role in the creation of a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon following the Israel-Lebanon conflict.

Italy led negotiations with the Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni and was proposed by Israel to head the multinational peacekeeping mission, although the dangers of the mission for Italian troops sparked warnings from the center-right opposition that it could prove a &quot;kamikaze&quot; mission, with the peacekeepers sandwiched between Israel and the well-armed Hezbollah. Prodi and D&#x27;Alema pledged Italy&#x27;s willingness to enforce the United Nations resolution on Lebanon and urged other European Union member states to do the same because the stability of the Middle East should be a chief concern for Europeans.

===Coalition&#x27;s troubles===
Prodi&#x27;s government faced a crisis over policies in early 2007, after just nine months of government. Three ministers in Prodi&#x27;s Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved the expansion of the US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was so narrow that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member UDEUR, said he would rather see the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.

Tens of thousands of people marched in Vicenza against the expansion of Caserma Ederle, which saw the participation of some leading far-left members of the government. Harsh debates followed in the Italian Senate on 20 February 2007. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Massimo D&#x27;Alema declared during an official visit in Ibiza, Spain that, without a majority on foreign policy affairs, the government would resign. The following day, D&#x27;Alema gave a speech at the Senate representing the government, clarifying his foreign policy and asking the Senate to vote for or against it. In spite of the fear of many senators that Prodi&#x27;s defeat would return Silvio Berlusconi to power, the Senate did not approve a motion backing Prodi&#x27;s government foreign policy, two votes shy of the required majority of 160.
After a government meeting on 21 February, Romano Prodi tendered his resignation to the president, Giorgio Napolitano, who cut short an official visit to Bologna in order to receive the prime minister. Prodi&#x27;s spokesman indicated that he would only agree to form a new Government &quot;if, and only if, he is guaranteed the full support of all the parties in the majority from now on.&quot; On 22 February, centre-left coalition party leaders backed a non-negotiable list of twelve political conditions given by Prodi as conditions of his remaining in office. President Napolitano held talks with political leaders on 23 February to decide whether to confirm Prodi&#x27;s Government, ask Prodi to form a new government or call fresh elections.

Following these talks, on 24 February, President Napolitano asked Prodi to remain in office but to submit to a vote of confidence in both houses. On 28 February, the Senate voted to grant confidence to Prodi&#x27;s Government. Though facing strong opposition from the centre-right coalition, the vote resulted in a 162–157 victory. Prodi then faced a vote of confidence in the lower house on 2 March, which he won as expected with a large majority of 342–198.

On 14 October 2007, Prodi oversaw the merger of two main parties of the Italian centre-left, Democrats of the Left and Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy, creating the Democratic Party. Prodi himself led the merger of the two parties, which had been planned over a twelve-year period, and became the first President of the party. He announced his resignation from that post on 16 April 2008, two days after the Democratic Party&#x27;s defeat in the general election.

===2008 crisis and resignation===

In early January 2008, Justice Minister and Union of Democrats for Europe&#x27;s leader Clemente Mastella resigned after his wife Sandra Lonardo was put under house arrest for corruption charges. With three Senators, UDEUR was instrumental to ensure a narrow centre-left majority in the Italian Senate.

After first promising to support the government, he later retracted this support, and his party followed, in part also due to pressure from the Vatican, for which the government&#x27;s proposed laws in regards to registered partnerships of same-sex couples, and other liberal reforms were objectionable. Mastella also cited lack of solidarity from the majority parties after the arrest of his wife, and declared that his party would vote against the government bills since then.

The decision of former Minister of Justice Mastella arrived a few days after the confirmation of the Constitutional Court which confirmed the referendum to modify the electoral system. As stated many times by Minister Mastella, if the referendum had been confirmed, it would lead directly to the fall of the government
and it happened. The fall of the government would disrupt a pending election-law referendum that if passed would make it harder for small parties like Mastella&#x27;s to gain seats in parliament.

The UDEUR defection forced caused Prodi to ask for a confidence vote in both Chambers: he won a clear majority in the Chamber of Deputies on 23 January, but was defeated 156 to 161 (with 1 abstention) in the Senate the next day. He therefore tendered his resignation as prime minister to President Giorgio Napolitano, who accepted it and appointed the President of the Senate, Franco Marini, with the task of evaluating possibilities for forming interim government to implement electoral reforms prior to holding elections. Marini, after consultation with all major political forces, acknowledged the impossibility of doing so on 5 February, forcing Napolitano to announce the end of the legislature. Prodi said that he would not seek to lead a new government and snap election were called. In the election that followed in April 2008, Berlusconi&#x27;s centre-right The People of Freedom and allies defeated the Democratic Party.

==After the premiership (2008–present)==

On 19 March 2008, during the political campaign for the snap general election, Romano Prodi stated &quot;I called it a day with Italian politics and maybe with politics in general.&quot;

On 12 September 2008, Prodi was named by the UN as head of a joint AU-UN panel aimed at enhancing peacekeeping operations in Africa.

On 6 February 2009, he was appointed Professor-at-Large at the Watson Institute for International Studies of Brown University. Since 2010 Romano Prodi is the chair for Sino-European dialogue at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS – Shanghai&amp;Beijing), China&#x27;s leading business school.

On 9 October 2012, Romano Prodi was appointed by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as his Special Envoy for the Sahel. He served in that position until 31 January 2014.

Prodi is also a member of the Club de Madrid, an international organization of former democratic statesmen, which works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership. He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

===2013 presidential candidate===
Prodi was drafted by Democratic Party parliamentarians to be President of Italy during the 2013 presidential election after Democratic Party–People of Freedom compromise candidate Franco Marini failed to receive sufficient votes on the first ballot. During the first three rounds of voting, few people cast ballots for Prodi (14 on the first ballot, 13 on the second and 22 on the third).

On 16 April 2013, just a few days prior to the fourth ballot, Prodi gave a &quot;lectio magistralis&quot; at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; entitled &quot;I grandi cambiamenti della politica e dell&#x27;economia mondiale: c&#x27;è un posto per l&#x27;Europa?&quot; (&quot;The Great Changes in Politics and the World Economy: Is there Room for Europe?). Prodi was sponsored by the &quot;Angelicum&quot; and the Università degli Studi Guglielmo Marconi on behalf of the Political Science program &quot;Scienze Politiche e del Buon Governo.&quot;

A few days later on 19 April, starting on the fourth ballot Prodi was looked at seriously as a possible candidate. However, Prodi announced he was pulling out of the race for President after more than 100 centre-left electors did not vote for him as he received only 395 (of 504 votes needed to be elected). After this vote, Pier Luigi Bersani, leader of centre-left Democratic Party, announced his resignation as party&#x27;s secretary. As of September 2020, he is a member of the Italian Aspen Institute.

<text>William Bacon Oliver (May 23, 1867 – May 27, 1948) was a Congressman from Alabama.

He was born in Eutaw, Alabama, graduated from the University of Alabama in 1887 and from the law department in 1889. After additional courses at the University of Virginia in the same year, he was admitted to the Alabama bar, and set up a practice in Tuscaloosa.

He became dean of the law school of the University of Alabama in 1909, serving until 1913, then ran successfully for Congress in 1914, and remained there for eleven Congresses, not standing for reelection in 1936.

He then served as a special assistant to the United States Attorney General from 1939 to 1944, at which time he retired. He died in 1948, and is buried in the Eutaw Cemetery in Eutaw.

The William Bacon Oliver Lock and Dam on the Black Warrior River in Alabama is named after him, as is Oliver Lake behind the dam.

<doc id="197986" wikidata="Q8054108" url="?curid=197986" title="Yo-yo problem">
<text>In software development, the yo-yo problem is an anti-pattern that occurs when a programmer has to read and understand a program whose inheritance graph is so long and complicated that the programmer has to keep flipping between many different class definitions in order to follow the control flow of the program. It is most often seen in the context of object-oriented programming. The term comes from comparing the bouncing attention of the programmer to the up-down movement of a toy yo-yo. Taenzer, Ganti, and Podar described the problem by name, explaining: &quot;Often we get the feeling of riding a yoyo when we try to understand one of these message trees.&quot; 

Most practices of object-oriented programming recommend keeping the inheritance graph as shallow as possible, in part to avoid this problem. The use of composition instead of inheritance is also strongly preferred, although this still requires that a programmer keep multiple class definitions in mind at once.

Deep hierarchies are a code smell and a symptom of sub-classification for code reuse.

More generally, the yo-yo problem can also refer to any situation where a person must keep flipping between different sources of information in order to understand a concept.

There are several code refactor techniques to flatten these hierarchies without compromising the overall behavior.

Object-oriented design techniques such as documenting layers of the inheritance hierarchy can reduce the effect of this problem, as they collect in one place the information that the programmer is required to understand.

<doc id="197995" wikidata="Q7075065" url="?curid=197995" title="Object slicing">
<text>In C++ programming, object slicing occurs when an object of a subclass type is copied to an object of superclass type: the superclass copy will not have any of the member variables or member functions defined in the subclass. These variables and functions have, in effect, been &quot;sliced off&quot;.

More subtly, object slicing can likewise occur when an object of a subclass type is copied to an object of the &quot;same&quot; type by the superclass&#x27;s assignment operator, in which case some of the target object&#x27;s member variables will retain their original values instead of getting copied over from the source object.

This issue is not inherently unique to C++, but it does not occur naturally in most other object-oriented languages — not even in C++&#x27;s relatives such as D, Java, and C# — because copying of objects is not a basic operation in those languages. 

Instead, those languages prefer to manipulate objects via implicit references, such that only copying the &quot;reference&quot; is a basic operation.

In C++, by contrast, objects are copied automatically whenever a function takes an object argument by value or returns an object by value.

Additionally, due to the lack of garbage collection in C++, programs will frequently copy an object whenever the ownership and lifetime of a single shared object would be unclear. For example, inserting an object into a standard library collection (such as a ) typically involves making and inserting a &quot;copy&quot; into the collection.

==Example==

struct A
 A(int a) : a_var(a) {}
 int a_var;

struct B : public A
 B(int a, int b) : A(a), b_var(b) {}
 int b_var;

B &amp;getB()
 static B b(1, 2);
 return b;

int main()
 // Normal assignment by value to a
 A a(3);
 // a.a_var == 3
 a = getB();
 // a.a_var == 1, b.b_var not copied to a

 B b2(3, 4);
 // b2.a_var == 3, b2.b_var == 4
 A &amp;a2 = b2;
 // Partial assignment by value through reference to b2
 a2 = getB();
 // b2.a_var == 1, b2.b_var == 4!

 return 0;

<doc id="198005" wikidata="Q1198491" url="?curid=198005" title="F-Zero (video game)">
<text>is a 1990 racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was released in Japan on November 21, 1990, in North America in August 1991, and in Europe in 1992. &quot;F-Zero&quot; is the first game in the &quot;F-Zero&quot; series and was a launch game for the SNES. &quot;F-Zero&quot; was rereleased for the Virtual Console service on various Nintendo platforms and as part of the Super NES Classic Edition in 2017.

The game takes place in the year 2560, where multi-billionaires with lethargic lifestyles created a new form of entertainment based on Formula One races called &quot;F-Zero&quot;. The player can choose between one of four characters in the game, each with their respective hovercar. The player can race against computer-controlled characters in 15 tracks divided into three leagues.

&quot;F-Zero&quot; has been acknowledged by critics for setting the standard for the racing genre and the creation of its futuristic subgenre. Critics lauded &quot;F-Zero&quot; for its fast and challenging gameplay, variety of tracks, and extensive use of the Mode 7 graphics mode. This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was &quot;F-Zero&quot;. As a result, it is credited for reinvigorating the genre and inspiring the future creation of numerous racing games.

==Gameplay==

&quot;F-Zero&quot; is a futuristic racing game in which players compete in a high-speed racing tournament called &quot;F-Zero&quot;. There are four &quot;F-Zero&quot; characters. Each has their own selectable hovercar, and each hovercar has its own unique performance abilities. The objective of the game is to beat opponents to the finish line while avoiding hazards such as slip zones and magnets that pull the vehicle off-center in an effort to make the player damage their vehicle or fall completely off the track. Each machine has a power meter, which serves as a measurement of the machine&#x27;s durability; it decreases when the machine collides with land mines, the side of the track or another vehicle. Energy can be replenished by driving over pit areas placed along the home straight or nearby.

A race in &quot;F-Zero&quot; consists of five laps around the track. The player must complete each lap in a successively higher place to avoid disqualification from the race. For each lap completed, the player is rewarded with an approximate four-second speed boost called the &quot;Super Jet&quot; and a number of points determined by place. An on-screen display will be shaded green to indicate that a boost can be used; however, the player is limited to saving up to three at a time. If a certain number of points are accumulated, an extra &quot;spare machine&quot; is acquired, which gives the player another chance to retry the course. Tracks may feature two methods for temporarily boosting speeds; jump plates launch vehicles into the air thus providing additional acceleration for those not at full speed and dash zones greatly increases the racer&#x27;s speed on the ground. &quot;F-Zero&quot; includes two modes of play. In the Grand Prix mode, the player chooses a league and races against other vehicles through each track in that league while avoiding disqualification. The Practice mode allows the player to practice seven of the courses from the Grand Prix mode.

&quot;F-Zero&quot; has a total of fifteen tracks divided into three leagues ordered by increasing difficulty: Knight, Queen, and King. Furthermore, each league has four selectable difficulty levels: beginner, standard, expert, and master. The multiple courses of Death Wind, Port Town, and Red Canyon have a pathway that is not accessible unless the player is on another iteration of those tracks, which then in turn closes the path previously available. Unlike most &quot;F-Zero&quot; games, there are three iterations of Mute City that show it in either a day, evening, or night setting with slightly different configurations. In &quot;BS F-Zero 2&quot;, Mute City IV continued the theme with an early morning setting.

==Setting==
&quot;F-Zero&quot; is set in the year 2560, when humanity&#x27;s multiple encounters with alien life forms had resulted in the expansion of Earth&#x27;s social framework. This led to commercial, technological and cultural interchanges between planets. The multi-billionaires who earned their wealth through intergalactic trade were mainly satisfied with their lifestyles, although most coveted more entertainment in their lives. This resulted in a new entertainment based on the Formula One races to be founded with vehicles that could hover one foot above the track. These Grand Prix races were soon named &quot;F-Zero&quot; after a rise in popularity of the races. The game introduced the first set of &quot;F-Zero&quot; racers: Captain Falcon, Dr. Stewart, Pico, and Samurai Goroh. IGN claimed Captain Falcon &quot;was thrust into the limelight&quot; in this game since he was the &quot;star character&quot;. An eight-page comic was included in its SNES manual that carried the reader through one of Captain Falcon&#x27;s bounty missions.

==Development and releases==
&quot;F-Zero&quot; was released alongside the SNES in Japan on November 21, 1990, in North America in August 1991, and in Europe in 1992. Only it and &quot;Super Mario World&quot; were initially available for the Japanese launch. In North America, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; shipped with the console, and other initial games included &quot;F-Zero&quot;, &quot;Pilotwings&quot;, &quot;SimCity&quot;, and &quot;Gradius III&quot;. The game was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and directed by Kazunobu Shimizu who also worked on art. Takaya Imamura, one of the art designers for the game, was surprised to be able to so freely design &quot;F-Zero&quot;″s characters and courses as he wanted since it was his first game. Yasunari Nishida served as the main programmer. A total of nine people including three programmers worked on &quot;F-Zero&quot;. It was common practice for personnel to take on multiple roles for SNES game development.

Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a raster graphical plane to be rotated and scaled freely, simulating the appearance of 3D environments without processing any polygons. The Mode 7 rendering applied in &quot;F-Zero&quot; consists of a single-layer which is scaled and rotated around the vehicle. This pseudo-3D capability of the SNES was designed to be represented by the game. 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish stated that &quot;F-Zero&quot; and &quot;Pilotwings&quot; &quot;existed almost entirely for the sake of showing [the system&#x27;s pseudo-3D capabilities] off&quot; as they outclassed the competition.

The game was downloadable over the Nintendo Power peripheral in Japan and was also released as a demo onto the Nintendo Super System in 1991. An &quot;F-Zero&quot; jazz album was released on March 25, 1992, in Japan by Tokuma Japan Communications. It features twelve songs from the game on a single disc composed by Yumiko Kanki and Naoto Ishida, and arranged by Robert Hill and Michiko Hill. The album also features Marc Russo (saxophones) of the Yellowjackets and Robben Ford (electric guitar). The game was re-released for the Virtual Console service on the Wii in late 2006, then on the Wii U in February 2013, followed by its New Nintendo 3DS release in March 2016. Nintendo re-released &quot;F-Zero&quot; in September 2017 as part of the company&#x27;s Super NES Classic Edition. It was also later included as one of the 20 SNES games for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in September 2019.

==Reception==
&quot;F-Zero&quot; was widely lauded by game critics for its graphical realism, and has been called the fastest and most fluid pseudo-3D racing game of its time for home systems. This has been mostly credited to the development team&#x27;s pervasive use of the &quot;Mode 7&quot; system. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Tom Bramwell commented &quot;this abundance of Mode 7 was unheard of&quot; for the SNES. This graphics-rendering technique was an innovative technological achievement at the time that made racing games more realistic, the first of which was &quot;F-Zero&quot;. Jeremy Parish of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; wrote that the game&#x27;s use of Mode 7 created the &quot;most convincing racetracks that had ever been seen on a home console&quot; that gave &quot;console gamers an experience even more visceral than could be found in the arcades.&quot; &quot;1UP.com&quot; editor Ravi Hiranand agreed, arguing &quot;F-Zero&quot;″s combination of fast-paced racing and free-range of motion were superior compared to that of previous home console games. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Peer Schneider assured readers &quot;F-Zero&quot; was one of the few 16-bit era video games to &quot;perfectly combine presentation and functionality to create a completely new gaming experience&quot;.

The game was praised for its variety of tracks, and steady increase in difficulty. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Jason D&#x27;Aprile thought the game &quot;was something of a racer. It took lots of practice, good memorization skills, and a rather fine sense of control.&quot; Matt Taylor of &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; commented that the game is more about &quot;reflexes than realism&quot;, and it lacked the ability to save progress between races. &quot;F-Zero&quot;″s soundtrack was lauded.

In &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s retrospective review by Greg Kasavin, he praised &quot;F-Zero&quot;″s controls, longevity and track design. Kasavin felt it offered exceptional gameplay, with &quot;a perfect balance of pick-up-and-play accessibility and sheer depth&quot;. Retrospective reviews agreed that the game should have used a multiplayer mode. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Lucas Thomas criticized the lack of a substantial plot and mentioned &quot;F-Zero&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the same impact these days&quot; suggesting &quot;the sequels on GBA very much pick up where this title left off&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called the game &quot;Blisteringly fast, seriously challenging and insanely fun&quot;, ranking the game 66th on a list of greatest Nintendo games. 

===Legacy===

&quot;F-Zero&quot; has been credited with being the game that set a standard for the racing genre and inventing the &quot;futuristic racing&quot; subgenre of video games. IGN credits the game for having inspired the future creation of numerous racing games inside and out of the futuristic subgenre, including the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series and &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. Toshihiro Nagoshi, President of Sega&#x27;s Amusement Vision, stated in 2002 that &quot;F-Zero&quot; &quot;actually taught me what a game should be&quot; and that it served as an influence for him to create &quot;Daytona USA&quot; and other racing games. Amusement Vision collaborated with Nintendo to develop &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; and &quot;AX&quot;, with Nagoshi serving as one of the co-producers for these games.

&quot;F-Zero&quot; has continued to be included in lists of the best SNES video games ever for decades since its release. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; rated the game 50th on their Top 100 SNES Games summarizing: &quot;It’s old and basic but this garish futuristic offering still pushes your driving skills to the limit. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked it the 18th best console video game of all time, citing its tight controls, the different handling characteristics of the four craft, and the competitive opponent AI. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;F-Zero&quot; as the 91st best game ever in 2003, discussing its originality at time of release and as the 97th best game ever in 2005, describing it as still &quot;respected as one of the all-time top racers&quot;. &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; placed it as the 18th best SNES game. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; listed F-Zero 31st on its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time.&quot;

Nintendo initially developed the sequel of the first &quot;F-Zero&quot; game for the SNES, although it was broadcast in several versions on the St.GIGA subscription service for the Satellaview attachment of the Super Famicom instead. Using this add-on, players could download games via satellite and save it onto a flash ROM cartridge for temporary play. The sequel was released under the Japanese names of &quot;BS F-Zero Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2&quot; during the mid-1990s. &quot;BS F-Zero Grand Prix&quot; contained a new track along with the original 15 tracks from the SNES game and four different playable vehicles. According to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, the game was under consideration for a North American release via Game Pak. &quot;IGN&quot; states &quot;BS F-Zero Grand Prix 2&quot; features one new league containing five tracks, a Grand Prix and a Practice mode.

Although the &quot;F-Zero&quot; franchise made the transition to 3D graphics on the Nintendo 64 with the release of &quot;F-Zero X&quot; in 1998, Mode 7 graphical effects continued to be used for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) installments &quot;Maximum Velocity&quot; (2001), &quot;GP Legend&quot; (2003), and &quot;Climax&quot; (2004). &quot;F-Zero: Maximum Velocity&quot; was described by &quot;GameSpy&quot; as a hard overhaul of &quot;F-Zero&quot; and featured improvements to its graphical effects. &quot;F-Zero Climax&quot; features expanded backgrounds, improved track detail, and a more distinguishable separation between the course and ground below. The free online racing video game, &quot;F-Zero 99&quot; (2023), was released through the Nintendo Switch Online (NSO) subscription service. In a similar vein to the NSO exclusives like &quot;Tetris 99&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man 99&quot;, the game reuses graphical aesthetics and gameplay, and recontextualizes it as a battle royale — players choose the same vehicles and tracks from the 1990 game.

<doc id="198006" wikidata="Q290356" url="?curid=198006" title="San Pedro, Los Angeles">
<text>San Pedro ( ; ) is a neighborhood located within the South Bay and Harbor region of the city of Los Angeles, California, United States. Formerly a separate city, it consolidated with Los Angeles in 1909. The Port of Los Angeles, a major international seaport, is partially located within San Pedro. The district has grown from being dominated by the fishing industry, to a working-class community within the city of Los Angeles, to an increasingly dense and diverse community.

==History==

=== Indigenous ===

The peninsula, including all of San Pedro, was the homeland of the Tongva for thousands of years, home to the village of Chowigna along and the nearby Suangna. In other areas of the Los Angeles Basin archeological sites date back to at least about 10,000 years old. The Tongva used seafaring plank canoes or &quot;te&#x27;aats&quot;, found all throughout the coastline, to travel to and from the Channel Islands and along the coastline. The boats are still constructed by the Tongva today and retain a cultural significance.

First contact with Europeans occurred in 1542 with Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo, the Spanish explorer who noted the extensive presence of the plank boats of the neighboring Chumash.

===Origin of name===

San Pedro was named for St. Peter of Alexandria, as his feast day is November 24 on the ecclesiastical calendar of Spain, the day on which Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo first encountered the San Pedro Bay in 1542. Santa Catalina Island, named after Catherine of Alexandria, was claimed for the Spanish Empire the next day, on her feast day, November 25. In 1602–1603, Sebastián Vizcaíno (1548–1624) officially surveyed and mapped the California coastline, including San Pedro Bay, for New Spain. The anglicized pronunciation is &quot;san-PEE-dro&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LAist 2013/05/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement===

European settlement began in 1769 as part of an effort to populate California, although trade restrictions encouraged more smuggling than regular business. In 1784, the Spanish Crown deeded Rancho San Pedro, a tract of over , to retired soldier Juan José Domínguez, who helped explore California with the Portolá expedition in 1769–1770. Rancho San Pedro was the first land grant in the Alta California portion of the Province of Las Californias in New Spain.

When New Spain won its independence from the Spanish Empire and Alta California became part of Mexico, the trade restrictions were lifted, and the town flourished.

Under United States control after 1848, when the United States defeated Mexico in the Mexican–American War, the harbor was greatly improved and expanded under the guidance of Phineas Banning and John Gately Downey, the seventh governor of California after the Free Harbor Fight. In 1868 Banning created the Los Angeles &amp; San Pedro Railroad, Southern California&#x27;s first railroad and used it to transport goods from San Pedro Bay to Los Angeles, which soon became a major city in Southern California.
San Pedro was a township in the 1860 census. The township consisted of the present-day South Bay communities, Compton and western Long Beach. Census records report a population of 359 in 1860. The township was renamed Wilmington Township for 1870.

In 1906, the city of Los Angeles annexed the Harbor Gateway, a long, narrow strip of land connecting the city to the northern border of Wilmington, and in 1909, the larger city consolidated with Wilmington and with San Pedro.

In 1929, the city experienced the Sunken City Disaster, where an earthquake caused multiple homes to slide off a cliff into the sea.
===United States Navy Battle Fleet home port 1919–1940===

In 1888, the War Department took control of a tract of land next to the bay and added to it in 1897 and 1910. This became Fort MacArthur in 1914 and was a coastal defense site for many years. Woodrow Wilson transferred 200 United States Navy ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1919 when tension arose between the United States and Japan over the fate of China. San Diego Bay was considered too shallow for the largest ships, so the battleships anchored in San Pedro Bay on August 9, 1919. Local availability of fuel oil minimized transportation costs, and consistently good weather allowed frequent gunnery exercises off the nearby Channel Islands of California. The heavy cruisers of the Scouting Force were transferred from the Atlantic to San Pedro in response to the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria. By 1934, 14 battleships, two aircraft carriers, 14 cruisers, and 16 support ships were based at San Pedro. On April 1, 1940, the Pacific Fleet battleships sailed to Hawaii for annual fleet exercises. The battleships remained in the Hawaiian Islands to deter Japanese aggression until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The fleet post office, supply depot, fuel depot, degaussing range, ECM repair facility, and naval training schools for small craft, fire fighters, merchant ship communications, and anti-submarine attack remained at San Pedro through World War II; but the battle fleet never returned.

San Pedro was selected as the final home port of the battleship . The &quot;Iowa&quot; now serves as a museum ship and memorial recognizing &quot;the positive contributions of this battleship and its crew at critical moments in American history&quot;.

==Demographics==

===Population history===

Ethnically diverse San Pedro was a magnet for European immigrants from various countries for years, reflected in the number of restaurants representing diverse cuisines, especially Croatian, Portuguese, Mexican, Italian, Irish and Greek. San Pedro is home to the largest Italian-American community in Southern California, centered on the &quot;Via Italia&quot; (South Cabrillo Avenue). San Pedro is also considered the heart of the Croatian and Norwegian communities in Los Angeles. The Croatian community, originally composed of seafarers and fishermen from the Dalmatia (especially the islands of Brač, Hvar, Vis and Korčula) region, has been present in San Pedro since the settlement began more than 200 years ago. The City of Los Angeles even named a stretch of 9th Street &quot;Croatian Place&quot; in honor of the city&#x27;s old Croatian community. The Norwegian presence can be felt at the Norwegian Seamen&#x27;s Church.

Until February 1942, San Pedro was home to a vibrant Japanese immigrant community of about 3,000 people who lived in what had been described as a &quot;typical Japanese Fishing Village&quot; on Terminal Island (East San Pedro). These Japanese immigrants pioneered albacore fishing out of San Pedro Bay and harvesting abalone off White Point, thus leading the way in establishing a viable fishing industry in San Pedro. The 48-hour forced expulsion of these San Pedro residents and the razing of their homes and shops, as part of the Japanese-American internment during World War II, is described in Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston&#x27;s memoir &quot;Farewell to Manzanar&quot;.

===2000 census===

A total of 80,065 people lived in San Pedro&#x27;s 12.06 square miles, according to the 2000 U.S. census—averaging 6,640 people per square mile, near Los Angeles&#x27; total population density. The median age was 34 in the San Pedro neighborhood, considered average for Los Angeles.

Mexico and Italy were the most common places of birth for the 24.5% of the residents who were born abroad, considered a low percentage of foreign-born when compared with the city as a whole.

The $57,508 median household income in 2008 dollars was average for the city and county. Renters occupied 56.1% of the housing units, and homeowners occupied the rest. In 2000 there were 3,394 families headed by single parents, or 17.5%, a rate that was average for the county and the city.
In the same year there were 6,559 military veterans, or 11% of the population, considered high when compared to the city and county as a whole.

<text>Beak trimming (also spelled as beak-trimming; informally as debeaking), or beak conditioning, is the partial removal of the beak of poultry, especially layer hens and turkeys, although it is also performed on some quail and ducks. When multiple birds are confined in small spaces, they are more likely to hurt each other through pecking. Beak trimming aims to avoid damage done by pecking, although the practice is criticized by animal welfare organizations and banned in several European countries. Beak trimming is most common in egg-laying strains of chickens. In some countries, such as the United States, turkeys routinely have their beaks trimmed. In the UK, only 10% of turkeys are beak trimmed.

In close confinement, cannibalism, feather pecking and aggression are common among turkeys, ducks, pheasants, quail, and chickens of many breeds (including both heritage breeds and modern hybrids) kept for eggs. The tendency to cannibalism and feather pecking varies among different strains of chickens, but does not manifest itself consistently. Some flocks of the same breed may be entirely free from cannibalism, while others, under the same management, may have a serious outbreak. Mortalities, mainly due to cannibalism, can be up to 15% in egg laying flocks housed in aviaries, straw yards, and free-range systems. Because egg laying strains of chickens can be kept in smaller group sizes in caged systems, cannibalism is reduced leading to a lowered trend in mortality as compared to non-cage systems. Cannibalism among flocks is highly variable and when it is not problematic, then mortalities among production systems are similar.

Opponents of beak trimming state that the practice reduces problem pecking by minor amounts compared to the trauma, injury, and harm done to the entire flock by beak trimming. Several countries have banned the practice, including Denmark (2013), Finland (1986), Germany (2017), the Netherlands (2019), Norway (1974) and Sweden (1988); analysts expect other European countries such as the UK to follow in the near future. Alternatives to beak trimming include enrichment or providing more space for the birds.

== History ==
===Twentieth century===
Beak trimming was developed at the Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station in the 1930s. The original technique was temporary, cutting approximately 6 mm (1/4 inch) off the beak. It was thought that the tip of the beak had no blood supply and presumably no sensation. The procedure was performed by hand with a sharp knife, either when deaths due to cannibalism became excessive, or when the problem was anticipated because of a history of cannibalism in the particular strain of chicken.

Cannibalism is a serious management problem dating back to the periods before intensive housing of poultry became popular. Poultry books written before vertical integration of the poultry industry describe the abnormal pecking of poultry:

Chicks and adult birds&#x27; picking at each other until blood shows and then destroying one another by further picking is a source of great loss in many flocks, especially when kept in confinement ... The recommendation of the Ohio Experiment Station of cutting back the tip of the upper beak has been found to be effective until the beak grows out again.
Cannibalism has two peaks in the life of a chicken; during the brooding period and at the onset of egg laying. The point-of-lay cannibalism is generally the most damaging and gets most of the attention. The temporary beak trimming developed at the Ohio Experiment Station assumed that cannibalism was a phase, and that blunting the beak temporarily would be adequate.

===Twenty-first century===
In the twenty-first century, the aim has been to develop more permanent beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut. By 2012 there were four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including scissors or secateurs), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and infrared. The latter two methods usually remove only the tip of the beak and do not leave an open wound; therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches such as the use of lasers, freeze drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use. The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips. The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys. The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming of turkeys that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate. It was considered that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for turkeys.

In the UK, beak trimming of layer hens normally occurs at 1-day of age at the same time as the chick is being sexed and vaccinated.

The US&#x27;s UEP guidelines suggest that in egg laying strains of chickens, the length of the upper beak distal from the nostrils that remains following trimming, should be 2 to 3 mm. In the UK, the Farm Animal Welfare Council stated: &quot;The accepted procedure is to remove not more than one third of the upper and lower beaks or not more than one third of the upper beak only&quot; but went on to recommend: &quot;Where beak trimming is carried out, it should, wherever possible, be restricted to beak tipping; that is the blunting of the beak to remove the sharp point which can be the cause of the most severe damage to other birds.&quot;

== Legislation ==
There is a trend towards prohibition of beak trimming in Europe over the course of decades. Analysts expect the practice to be gradually banned across the continent.

EU law allows member states to debeak poultry according to two regulations: Directive 1999/74/EC for laying hens allows beak trimming, while Directive 2007/43/EC for broilers permits beak trimming only in certain cases. As of April 2019, 80% of laying hens in the EU were estimated to be beak-trimmed.

=== Australia ===
As of July 2019, beak trimming is only banned in the Australian Capital Territory by means of the Animal Welfare Act 1992 (ACT) s 9C. It is currently debated in parliament whether debeaking should be banned in Victoria and New South Wales. A 2019 Voiceless report recommended the NSW Parliament to prohibit debeaking and instead &#x27;[introduce] enriched environmental conditions, such as litter and suitable range areas [to] encourage interaction and mental stimulation for hens. Better nutrition, lighting and parasite management may also help reduce injurious pecking.&#x27; In a 2015 survey conducted by the Humane Society International Australia, 91% of respondents stated that free range egg boxes should display whether the hens had undergone beak trimming.

=== Canada ===
Beak trimming is legal but regulated in Canada. The National Farm Animal Care Council&#x27;s 2016 Poultry Code of Practice urges to &#x27;make every effort to manage breeders so that physical alterations, such as beak trimming, are not necessary&#x27;; should it prove necessary, however, infrared treatment is recommended over hot blade treatment.

=== China ===
There are no regulations on beak trimming in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Some companies have decided to voluntarily phase out debeaking, such as Ningxia Xiaoming Farming and Animal Husbandry Co. Ltd.

=== France ===
In France, clipping beaks of poultry chickens is authorised only when it preserves the health and wellbeing of animals, meaning to limit the risks of cannibalism and pecking. It is only authorised on chicks less than 10 days old intended for laying eggs and must be carried out by qualified personnel. It can therefore be carried out by breeders and agricultural workers.

=== Germany ===
Agriculture Minister Christian Meyer announced that Germany would phase out beak trimming by 2017 due to animal welfare concerns.

=== Netherlands ===
A ban on beak trimming in the Netherlands was first announced in 1996, but due to objections from the poultry sector it was delayed for years. In June 2013, the government struck an agreement between poultry farmers and animal welfare groups to phase out debeaking and prohibit it in 2018. The prohibition on trimming eventually went into effect on 1 January 2019.

=== New Zealand ===
Beak trimming, officially known as &#x27;beak tipping&#x27; in law, is legal but regulated in New Zealand. The Layer Hens Code of Welfare (last updated 1 October 2018) notes that the National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (NAWAC) &quot;encourages the industry to develop management systems to protect against all forms of injurious pecking without the need for beak tipping&quot;. The Code recommends that &quot;[a]lternative strategies for managing injurious (feather) pecking that minimise the need for beak tipping should be employed e.g. use and availability of different foraging resources.&quot; In case that beak tipping is deemed necessary, however, it requires competent trained operators, must be carried out within 3 days of hatching (except in emergencies under veterinary supervision) and may not remove more than one-quarter of the upper or lower beaks.

=== Nordic countries ===
Norway was the first country in the world to outlaw beak trimming in 1974, followed by Finland in 1986 and Sweden in 1988. Beak trimming was subsequently phased out in Denmark in two stages: in 2013 for the enriched cage system and in 2014 for aviary and free range systems.

=== Switzerland ===
Beak trimming in Switzerland is legal but regulated; it is expected that the practice will be prohibited in the near future. Although the use of cages for layer hens was prohibited in 1992, by 2000 still 59% of flocks (61% of hens) was still debeaked.

=== United Kingdom ===
Beak trimming is legal but regulated in the UK; it is expected that the practice will be prohibited in the near future. In 2011, the British government set up the Beak Trimming Action Group (BTAG) to review the matter with representatives from different stakeholders, including the industry, the government, animal welfare groups and veterinarians. A late 2015 BTAG report endorsed by Farming Minister George Eustice concluded that banning it in January 2016 would be too early as the sector needed more time to change its management techniques in order to avoid feather pecking, but that beak trimming should be phased out in the future. Laying Hen Welfare Forum chairman Andrew Joret stated in March 2020: &#x27;A ban is coming. In my opinion, we have five years at most to prepare for this. We need to work out ways of keeping birds well-feathered, and if we can, eventually do that without beak trimming.&#x27;

=== United States ===
Beak trimming is legal in the United States, but there are some regulations: producers need to have a beak-trimming policy, it may not be employed to improve feed efficiency, but may be used to prevent cannibalism.

Humane Society vice president Paul Shapiro stated that birds only resort to cannibalism when they are confined and have nothing to do. Reporters have stated that debeaking is only necessitated by farms&#x27; cramped and stressful condition. Industry groups have also stated that pecking behavior becomes worsened when hens are confined in close quarters. 

== Welfare implications ==
Beak trimming can cause acute stress, and possibly chronic pain following the trimming. A bird&#x27;s ability to consume food is impaired following beak trimming because of the new beak shape and pain. Most studies report reduced body weights and feed intake following beak trimming; however, by sexual maturity or peak egg production, growth rates are usually normal. Weight losses were reduced in chicks that were beak trimmed by infrared compared with chicks trimmed by a hot-blade.
Pain caused by beak trimming depends on the age it is performed, the method of trimming and the length of beak that is removed. Beak trimming in the poultry industry usually occurs without anaesthetic at 1-day of age or when the chicks are very young, but can occur at a later age if an outbreak of feather pecking occurs, and in some cases, birds may be beak trimmed on repeated occasions. Beak trimming is not permitted in the UK on meat chickens that are aged over 10 days.

=== Acute pain ===
The beak is a complex, functional organ with an extensive nervous supply including nociceptors that sense pain and noxious stimuli. These would almost certainly be stimulated during beak trimming, indicating strongly that acute pain would be experienced. Behavioural evidence of pain after beak trimming in layer hen chicks has been based on the observed reduction in pecking behavior, reduced activity and social behavior, and increased sleep duration.

In Japanese quail, beak-trimming by cauterization caused lower body weights and feed intake in the period just after beak trimming. Beak trimmed Muscovy ducks spent less time engaging in beak-related behaviours (preening, feeding, drinking, exploratory pecking) and more time resting than non-trimmed ducks in the days immediately post-trim. These differences disappeared by 1 week post-trim. At 1 week post-trim the trimmed ducks weighed less than non-trimmed ducks, but this difference disappeared by 2 weeks post-trim. It is, however, unclear if the above changes in behaviour arise from pain or from a loss of sensitivity in the beak.

Pecking force has been found to decrease after beak trimming in adult hens, possibly indicating that hens are protecting a painful area from further stimulation. However, pecking force did not differ between chicks with or without minor beak-trims at 2 to 9 days of age, suggesting that chicks with minor beak-trims do not experience pain from the beak.

=== Chronic pain ===
Severe beak trimming or beak trimming birds at an older age is thought to cause chronic pain. Following beak trimming of older or adult hens, the nociceptors in the beak stump show abnormal patterns of neural discharge, which indicate acute pain. Neuromas, tangled masses of swollen regenerating axon sprouts, are found in the healed stumps of birds beak trimmed at 5 weeks of age or older and in severely beak trimmed birds. Neuromas have been associated with phantom pain in human amputees and have therefore been linked to chronic pain in beak trimmed birds. If beak trimming is severe because of improper procedure or done in older birds, the neuromas will persist which suggests that beak trimmed older birds experience chronic pain, although this has been debated.

=== Benefits ===

The benefits of beak trimming are mainly welfare advantages for birds kept in close confinement, some of which directly relate to increases (or reduced decreases) in production. These include reduced feather pecking and cannibalism, better feathering (though they find it hard to preen with shortened beaks, which means they are not cleaning themselves well), less fearfulness and nervousness, less chronic stress, and decreased mortality.

== Alternatives ==
A range of options have been proposed as possible alternatives to beak trimming including modifying the genetics of domesticated poultry to reduce cannibalistic tendencies. For confined housing where light control is possible, lowering light intensity so that birds cannot see each other as easily reduces antagonistic encounters and aggressive behaviour. Enrichment devices, introduced at an early age, such as simple objects hung in a habitat, can reduce aggressive behavior. Dividing the population into smaller group sizes reduces cannibalism, as overcrowding is the principal stressor of poultry. Proper body weight management that avoids underweight pullets reduces the probability of underweight pullets with uterine prolapse that leads to cloacal cannibalism.

Free-range poultry and those given enrichment or more cubic space per animal suffer far less stress-related injuries and exhibit fewer cannibalistic tendencies, leading to the self-evident conclusion that if you provide your poultry with a higher quality of life they will be less likely to kill each other.

<doc id="198010" wikidata="Q623732" url="?curid=198010" title="Philip Marlowe">
<text>Philip Marlowe ( ) is a fictional character created by Raymond Chandler who was characteristic of the hardboiled crime fiction genre. The genre originated in the 1920s, notably in &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine, in which Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s The Continental Op and Sam Spade first appeared. Marlowe first appeared under that name in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, published in 1939. Chandler&#x27;s early short stories, published in pulp magazines such as &quot;Black Mask&quot; and &quot;Dime Detective&quot;, featured similar characters with names like &quot;Carmady&quot; and &quot;John Dalmas&quot;, starting in 1933.

Some of those short stories were later combined and expanded into novels featuring Marlowe, a process Chandler called &quot;cannibalizing&quot;, which is more commonly known in publishing as a fix-up. When the original stories were republished years later in the short-story collection &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot;, Chandler did not change the names of the protagonists to Philip Marlowe. His first two stories, &quot;Blackmailers Don&#x27;t Shoot&quot; and &quot;Smart-Aleck Kill&quot; (with a detective named Mallory), were never altered in print but did join the others as Marlowe cases for the television series &quot;Philip Marlowe, Private Eye&quot;.

Underneath the wisecracking, hard-drinking, tough private eye, Marlowe is quietly contemplative, philosophical and enjoys chess and poetry. While he is not afraid to risk physical harm, he does not dish out violence merely to settle scores. Morally upright, he is not fooled by the genre&#x27;s usual &quot;femmes fatales&quot;, such as Carmen Sternwood in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;. Chandler&#x27;s treatment of the detective novel exhibits an effort to develop the form. His first full-length book, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, was published when Chandler was 51; his last, &quot;Playback&quot;, when he was 70. He wrote seven novels in the last two decades of his life. An eighth, &quot;Poodle Springs&quot;, was completed posthumously by Robert B. Parker and published years later.

==Inspiration==
Explaining the origin of Marlowe&#x27;s character, Chandler commented, &quot;Marlowe just grew out of the pulps. He was no one person&quot;. When creating the character, Chandler had originally intended to call him Mallory; his stories for the &quot;Black Mask&quot; featured characters that are considered precursors to Marlowe. The emergence of Marlowe coincided with Chandler&#x27;s transition from writing short stories to novels.

The Cahuenga Building, where Phillip Marlowe&#x27;s office is located, is widely believed to be inspired by the Security Savings and Trust located on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.

==Biographical notes==
Philip Marlowe is a fictional character created by Raymond Chandler in a series of novels including &quot;The Big Sleep;&quot; &quot;Farewell, My Lovely;&quot; and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;. Chandler is not consistent as to Marlowe&#x27;s age. In &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, set in 1936, Marlowe&#x27;s age is given as 33, while in &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (set 14 years later), Marlowe is 42. In a letter to D. J. Ibberson of April 19, 1951, Chandler noted among other things that Marlowe is 38 years old and was born in Santa Rosa, California. He had a couple of years at college and some experience as an investigator for an insurance company and the district attorney&#x27;s office of Los Angeles County. He was fired from the DA&#x27;s office for insubordination (or as Marlowe put it, &quot;talking back&quot;). The DA&#x27;s chief investigator, Bernie Ohls, is a friend and former colleague and a source of information for Marlowe within law enforcement.

As with his age, Chandler is not consistent as to Marlowe&#x27;s height: in &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; he is described as being &quot;six feet, one half inch&quot;, while in &quot;Farewell My Lovely&quot; Marlowe describes one of his clients, Lindsay Marriott, as having &quot;an inch more of height than I had, which made him six feet one&quot; – meaning Marlowe is six feet tall himself. He weighs about . He is described as having dark hair and a medium heavy build (&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;); dark brown hair with some grey and brown eyes (&quot;The Long Good-bye&quot;). Marlowe first lived at the Hobart Arms, on Franklin Avenue near North Kenmore Avenue (in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;) but then moved to the Bristol Hotel, where he stayed for about 10 years. By 1950 (in &quot;The Long Good-bye&quot;) he has rented a house on Yucca Avenue in Laurel Canyon and continued at the same place in early 1952 in &quot;Playback&quot;, Chandler&#x27;s last full-length Marlowe novel.

His office, originally on the seventh floor of an unnamed building in 1936, is at #615 on the sixth floor of the Cahuenga Building by March–April 1939 (the date of &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;), which is on Hollywood Boulevard near Ivar. North Ivar Avenue is between North Cahuenga Boulevard to the west and Vine Street to the east. The office telephone number is GLenview 7537. Marlowe&#x27;s office is modest and he does not have a secretary (unlike Sam Spade). He generally refuses to take divorce cases.

He drinks whiskey or brandy frequently and in relatively large quantities. For example, in &quot;The High Window&quot;, he gets out a bottle of Four Roses and pours glasses for him, Det. Lt. Breeze and Spangler. At other times, he is drinking Old Forester, a Kentucky bourbon, &quot;I hung up and fed myself a slug of Old Forester to brace my nerves for the interview. As I was inhaling it I heard her steps tripping along the corridor&quot;. (&quot;The Little Sister&quot;) However, in &quot;Playback&quot; he orders a double Gibson at a bar while tailing Betty Mayfield. Also, in &quot;The Long Good-bye&quot;, Terry Lennox and he drink Gimlets; in the same novel he also orders a whiskey sour and drinks Cordon Rouge champagne with Linda Loring.

Marlowe is adept at using liquor to loosen peoples&#x27; tongues. An example is in &quot;The High Window&quot;, when Marlowe finally persuades the detective-lieutenant, whose &quot;solid old face was lined and grey with fatigue&quot;, to take a drink: &quot;Breeze looked at me very steadily. Then he sighed. Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again and shook his head sideways with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it is just right and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world&quot;.

He frequently drinks coffee. Eschewing the use of filters (see &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;), he uses a vacuum coffee maker (see &quot;The Long Good-bye&quot;, chapter 5). He smokes and prefers Camel cigarettes. At home and at his office (see Playback) he sometimes smokes a pipe. A chess adept, he is often described as playing games against himself or setting out and duplicating historical tournament games from books as a means of relaxation or clearing his head.

As is typical of pulp fiction private eyes from Sherlock Holmes onward, Marlowe is a bachelor throughout most of the novels. That he has sex with female characters is explicit or implied in each of the novels, but he is also shown resisting various sexual invitations and refusing to take advantage of other sexual opportunities on moral grounds. In &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; the divorced daughter of the press tycoon Harlan Potter, Linda Loring (with whom he has spent one night of passion), asks Marlowe to go with her to Paris, but he declines. Then, at the end of the next novel, &quot;Playback&quot; (set some 18 months later), Loring phones him from Paris and asks him again to join her (&quot;I&#x27;m asking you to marry me&quot;). Marlowe challenges her to come to him in L.A. instead, implicitly testing her sincerity. In the opening paragraphs of &quot;Poodle Springs&quot; he has just married her.

<text>Cards on the Table is a detective fiction novel by the English author Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 2 November 1936 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.

The book features the recurring characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race and Superintendent Battle, with the crime writer Ariadne Oliver making her first appearance in a Poirot novel. The four detectives and four possible suspects play bridge after dinner with Mr Shaitana. At the end of the evening, Mr Shaitana is discovered murdered. Identifying the murderer, according to the author, depends wholly on discerning the psychology of the suspects.

The novel was well received, the critics noting its humour, the subtlety and tightness of the writing, and the good clueing. A later reviewer considered the book to stand at the very top rung of her novels, while another appreciated the brilliant surprise ending.

==Plot==
Mr Shaitana, a flamboyant collector, meets Hercule Poirot by chance at an art exhibition and brags about his personal crime-related collection. Scoffing at the idea of collecting mere artefacts, Shaitana explains that he collects only the best exhibits: criminals who have evaded justice. He invites Poirot to a dinner party to meet them.

Poirot&#x27;s fellow guests include three other crime professionals: secret serviceman Colonel Race, mystery writer Mrs Ariadne Oliver, and Superintendent Battle of Scotland Yard; along with four people Shaitana believes to be murderers: Dr Roberts, Mrs Lorrimer, Anne Meredith, and Major Despard. Shaitana taunts his suspects with comments that each understands as applying only to them.

The guests retire to play bridge, the professionals playing in one room while the others play in a second room where Shaitana relaxes by the fire. As the party breaks up, Shaitana is found to be dead – stabbed in the chest with a stiletto from his own collection. None of the suspects can be ruled out, as all had moved around during the evening. Leading the police investigation, Superintendent Battle agrees to put his &quot;cards on the table&quot; and to allow the other professionals to make their own enquiries. Poirot uses the bridge scores to deduce the playing style and personality of each suspect.

The investigators look into the suspects&#x27; histories. The husband of one of Dr Roberts&#x27; patients died of anthrax shortly after accusing the doctor of improper conduct. A botanist that Despard had been guiding through the Amazon was rumoured to have been shot. Anne&#x27;s housemate Rhoda Dawes tells Mrs Oliver that an elderly woman for whom Anne was acting as companion died after mistaking hat paint for syrup of figs. Mrs Lorrimer&#x27;s husband had died twenty years earlier, though little is known about that.

Mrs Lorrimer tells Poirot that she has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and that she wishes to confess to killing both her husband and Shaitana. Poirot refuses to believe her psychologically capable of spontaneous murder, and thinks that she is protecting Anne. Mrs Lorrimer reluctantly discloses that she had actually seen Anne commit the crime, but feels sympathy for a young girl just starting out in life. The next day, Despard, Roberts, and Anne all receive a suicide note and confession to the crime, supposedly written by Mrs Lorrimer. Battle informs Poirot by telephone that Dr Roberts rushed to the house only to find the woman had died of an overdose. 

Poirot is again suspicious, as he knows that Anne had visited Mrs Lorrimer the previous night. He discovers that, due to the established time of death, Mrs Lorrimer could not possibly have sent the letters. Realising that Rhoda&#x27;s life is in danger, since she knows about the syrup of figs incident, Poirot, Battle, and Despard race to Rhoda&#x27;s cottage, arriving to find the two girls in a boat out on the river. Anne attempts to push Rhoda overboard, but Anne herself falls in and drowns, while Rhoda is rescued by Despard.

Poirot explains his findings. Despard had indeed shot and killed the botanist, but entirely by accident. Anne had poisoned her employer after switching the two bottles to conceal her petty thieving. Although Mrs Lorrimer thought she had seen Anne kill Shaitana, Anne had in fact just leaned forward to touch him and confirm he was already dead.

Poirot notes that only one suspect was psychologically capable of carrying out such a risky, unplanned stabbing – namely Dr Roberts. Fearing Shaitana had proof of the anthrax murder, Roberts quickly took his chance. He covered his tracks by forging Mrs Lorrimer&#x27;s letters and killing her with an injection when he visited her house. Although Roberts initially protests, he is forced to confess when Poirot reveals a surprise eye-witness to the killing, a window-cleaner. After Roberts is led away, Rhoda notes what amazing luck it was that the window cleaner had been there at the exact moment of the fatal injection. Poirot replies that it had not been luck at all, and introduces them to a hired actor whose presence had prompted Roberts&#x27; confession.

With the murder solved, Despard courts Rhoda.

==Foreword by the author==
The novel contains a foreword by the author in which she explains that the novel has only four suspects and that since any of them, given the right circumstances, might have committed the crime, the deduction must be &quot;entirely psychological&quot;. She notes that the book is no less interesting for that since &quot;when all is said and done it is the &quot;mind&quot; of the murderer that is of supreme interest&quot;.

==Literary significance and reception==
The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; (14 November 1936) stated favourably in its review by Caldwell Harpur that, &quot;Poirot scores again, scores in two senses, for this appears to be the authoress&#x27;s twentieth novel. One of the minor characters in it is an authoress of thirty-two detective novels; she describes in several amusing pages the difficulties of her craft. Certainly Mrs Christie ought to know them, but she continues to surmount them so well that another score of novels may be hoped for.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; (28 February 1937), Isaac Anderson concluded, &quot;The story is ingenious, but there are one or two loose ends left dangling when his explanation is finished. &quot;Cards on the Table&quot; is not quite up to Agatha Christie&#x27;s best work.&quot;

In &quot;The Observer&quot;″s issue of 15 November 1936, in a review section entitled &quot;Supreme de Poirot&quot;, &quot;Torquemada&quot; (Edward Powys Mathers) wrote, &quot;I was not the only one who thought that Poirot or his creator had gone a little off the rails in &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot;, which means that others beside myself will rejoice at Mrs Christie&#x27;s brilliant come-back in &quot;Cards on the Table&quot;. This author, unlike many who have achieved fame and success for qualities quite other than literary ones, has studied to improve in every branch of writing in each of her detective stories. The result is that, in her latest book, we note qualities of humour, composition and subtlety which we would have thought beyond the reach of the writer of &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;. Of course, the gift of bamboozlement, with which Agatha Christie was born, remains, and has never been seen to better advantage than in this close, diverting and largely analytical problem. &quot;Cards on the Table&quot; is perhaps the most perfect of the little grey cells.&quot;

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; (19 November 1936) wrote: &quot;There was a time when M. Hercule Poirot thought of going into retirement in order to devote himself to the cultivation of marrows. Fortunately, the threat was never carried out; and in Mrs Christie&#x27;s latest novel the little Belgian detective is in very good form indeed. The plot is simple but brilliant.&quot; The review concluded by saying, &quot;Mrs Oliver, the novelist, is one of Mrs Christie&#x27;s most amusing creations.&quot;

E.R. Punshon of &quot;The Guardian&quot; reviewed the novel in the 20 November 1936 issue when he began, &quot;Even in a tale of crime and mystery humour is often of high value.&quot; He went on to say that, &quot;In this respect... Agatha Christie shows herself once again... a model of detective tales. There are delightful passages when Poirot anxiously compares other moustaches with his own and awards his own the palm, when his lips are forced to utter the unaccustomed words &#x27;I was in error&#x27;, when Mrs Oliver, famous authoress, discourses upon art and craft of fiction. But all that never obscures the main theme as Poirot gradually unravels the puzzle of which four bridge-players had murdered their host.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Largely by a careful study of the score, Poirot is able to reach the truth, and Mrs Christie sees to it that he does so by way of springing upon the reader one shattering surprise after another.&quot;

Robert Barnard said, &quot;On the very top rung. Special opportunities for bridge enthusiasts, but others can play. Superb tight construction and excellent clueing. Will be read as long as hard-faced ladies gather for cards.&quot;

Charles Osborne said, &quot;&quot;Cards on the Table&quot; is one of Agatha Christie&#x27;s finest and most original pieces of crime fiction: even though the murderer is, as the author has promised, one of the four bridge players, the ending is positively brilliant and a complete surprise.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Stage adaptation===
The book was adapted as a stage play in 1981, although without Poirot. It opened at London&#x27;s Vaudeville Theatre on 9 December 1981 with Gordon Jackson as Superintendent Battle and a cast that included Derek Waring, Belinda Carroll, Mary Tamm and Patricia Driscoll.

===Television===
* ITV adapted the story into a television programme in the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot and Zoë Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver. The adaptation – with significant differences from the novel – was written by Nick Dear and aired in the US on A&amp;E Network in December 2005 and in the UK on ITV1 in March 2006. 

* The novel was also adapted as a 2014 episode of the French television series &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot;.

===Film===
In 2016 a Bengali film &quot;Chorabali&quot; was released based on the storyline of the &quot;Cards on the Table&quot;. Barun Chanda played the role of Poirot.

===Radio===

&quot;Cards on the Table&quot; was adapted for radio by Michael Bakewell for BBC Radio 4, featuring John Moffatt as Hercule Poirot, Donald Sinden as Colonel Johnny Race, and Stephanie Cole as Ariadne Oliver.

<doc id="198014" wikidata="Q1453643" url="?curid=198014" title="Grammy Award for Best New Artist">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best New Artist has been awarded since the 2nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1960 (except in 1967) &quot;for a new artist who releases, during the Eligibility Year, the first recording which establishes the public identity of that artist.&quot; Since 2022, the award is presented by the previous year&#x27;s winner.

The Best New Artist award has a reputation for being given to artists whose music industry success ends up being short-lived; it is sometimes asserted, with varying degrees of sincerity, that the award itself brings a curse. This viewpoint was expressed by Taffy Danoff, a former member of Starland Vocal Band (known for &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;), in an interview for VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest One Hit Wonders&quot;: &quot;We got two of the five Grammys – one was Best New Artist. So that was basically the kiss of death and I feel sorry for everyone who&#x27;s gotten it since.&quot;

The category is also notable for being the only category as of 2024 in which a Grammy Award was revoked: this occurred in 1990, when Milli Vanilli originally won the award, but band members Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus later admitted that they did not contribute their own vocals on their album &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;. The award was subsequently vacated.

==Further information==

Of the 65 acts who have won the award since its inception, 34 are solo female artists, 19 are duos or groups, and 12 are solo male artists. Of the solo male artists, half were given the award in its first decade; since 1970, only six solo male artists have won the award, the most recent being Chance the Rapper in 2017. From 1997 to 2003, and again from 2018 to 2025, all the winners were solo female artists. Only five artists have won both Best New Artist and Album of the Year in the same year: Bob Newhart in 1961, Christopher Cross in 1981, Lauryn Hill in 1999, Norah Jones in 2003, and Billie Eilish in 2020. Of these, Cross, Jones, and Eilish had songs winning Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the same year, with Cross as the sole songwriter, Eilish as co-writer, and Jones lacking songwriting credit, which therefore made her miss out on completing the single year big four Grammy achievement, a feat that only Cross and Eilish attained; while Adele was the only artist to win all General field Grammys from separate occasions. Only two artists have &quot;lost&quot; Best New Artist yet won Album of the Year in the same year: Vaughn Meader in 1963 and Alanis Morissette in 1996.

Of all the winners, only three have been country artists. In 1997, LeAnn Rimes became the first country artist and (at age 14) the youngest artist to win the award. She was followed by Carrie Underwood in 2007 and Zac Brown Band in 2010. Additionally, 2017 marked the first time that two country artists were nominated in this category in the same year, in which Maren Morris and Kelsea Ballerini were both nominated. In 2018, Alessia Cara became the first Canadian artist to ever win the award, and the only woman to win a major category that year. In 2020, Rosalía became the first all Spanish-language artist to be nominated. 2021 marked the first time that multiple female rappers were nominated in the same year, when Chika, Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion were all nominated, with the latter winning the award.

For the award&#x27;s first several years of existence, comedians and comic acts were regularly nominated, and one, Bob Newhart, won the award. However, this ended abruptly after 1963, and since then, only one comedian has been nominated for the award: Robin Williams in 1980. (That same year, the semi-comic act The Blues Brothers was also nominated.)

David Crosby and Carl Palmer hold the distinction of being the only artists to be nominated twice for this award. Palmer was nominated both times as a member of a supergroup: Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer and Asia, while Crosby was nominated as a member of The Byrds and won as a member of the supergroup Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.

1984 marked the first time that all of the nominees were from outside the United States (winner Culture Club, Eurythmics, Musical Youth, and Big Country were from the United Kingdom, and Men Without Hats were from Canada).

Eight artists who have been nominated for Best New Artist have later been awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award: The Beatles (1965, 2014), Chicago (1970, 2020), Cream (1969, 2006), Jefferson Airplane (1968, 2016), Antônio Carlos Jobim (1965, 2012), Led Zeppelin, (1970, 2005), Leontyne Price (1961, 1989), and John Prine (1972, 2020).

==Process==
From 1995 to 2021, members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences nominated their choices for the best new artist. A list of the top twenty artists was given to the Nominations Review Committee, a specially selected group of anonymous members, who initially selected the top five artists to gain a nomination in the category in a special ballot; the number of nominated artists was increased to eight in 2018. The rest of the members then vote on a winner from the final nominees. In 2021, it was announced that the Nomination Review Committees would be disbanded, and the final nominees for best new artist would be decided by votes from members. Starting in 2022, the number of nominees in the category increased to 10. However, the decision to expand the number of nominees in this category was made 24 hours before the nominees were announced after an early version of the nominations list had already been circulated. This allowed Baby Keem and Arooj Aftab to be nominated as they were the artists that received the most votes besides the other eight nominees. As of the 2024 ceremony, the number of nominees has been reduced to eight.

==Rules changes==
Over the years, the eligibility rules for this category have changed several times. In 2010, Lady Gaga&#x27;s exclusion from the Best New Artist category caused the Recording Academy to change eligibility requirements for the next ceremony. She was ineligible for the nomination because her hit &quot;Just Dance&quot; had been nominated in 2008. The new rule stated that an artist may be nominated as long as that artist has not previously released an entire album and has subsequently not won a Grammy. In June 2016, the Grammy organization amended the Best New Artist rules once again, to remove the album barrier &quot;given current trends in how new music and developing artists are released and promoted&quot;. To be eligible in the category of Best New Artist, the artist, duo, or group:

* Must have released a minimum of five singles/tracks or one album (until 2020 there was a maximum of 30 singles/tracks or three albums, but this maximum limit was removed for the 2021 awards season)
* May not have entered into this category more than three times, including as a performing member of an established group.
* Must have achieved a breakthrough into the public consciousness and impacted the musical landscape during the eligibility period.

These new rules were put in effect with the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. The category was then expanded to include eight nominees in 2019. Starting in 2021, screening committees were charged with determining whether the artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence prior to the eligibility year. Such a determination would result in disqualification.

==Recipients==
Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were handed out, for records released in the previous year.

 The Grammy Award for Best New Artist was not presented during the 9th Grammy Awards.&lt;br&gt;
 Milli Vanilli were originally presented with the award on February 21, 1990, but the award was revoked on November 19, 1990, following an admission by band members Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus that they were not the actual singers on the album. The category was declared vacant for 1990.

<text>A museum ship, also called a memorial ship, is a ship that has been preserved and converted into a museum open to the public for educational or memorial purposes. Some are also used for training and recruitment purposes, mostly for the small number of museum ships that are still operational and thus capable of regular movement.

Several hundred museum ships are kept around the world, with around 175 of them organised in the Historic Naval Ships Association though many are not naval museum ships, from general merchant ships to tugs and lightships. Many, if not most, museum ships are also associated with a maritime museum.

==Significance==

Relatively few ships are preserved beyond their useful life, due to the high cost of maintaining them against the ravages of the elements. Most are broken up and sold for scrap, while a relative handful are sunk as naval target practice, scuttled to create artificial reefs, and so on. Some survive because of historical significance, but more often due to luck and circumstance. Since an old ship tied up at dockside, without attention, still decays and eventually sinks, the practice of recent years has been to form some sort of preservation society, solicit donations from governments or private individuals, organize volunteer labor from the enthusiasts, and open the restored ship to visitors, usually for a fee.

When the USN turns over one of their ships to a museum, a contract must be signed, stating that the Navy bears no responsibility for the costs of restoration, preservation and maintenance. Also, major pieces of equipment such as engines and generators must be permanently disabled. If the ship requires services such as electricity and water, they must come through shore connections.

The restoration and maintenance of museum ships presents problems for historians who are asked for advice, and the results periodically generate some controversy. For instance, the rigging of sailing ships has almost never survived, and so the rigging plan must be reconstructed from various sources. Studying the ships also allows historians to analyze how life on and operation of the ships took place. Numerous scientific papers have been written on ship restoration and maintenance, and international conferences are held discussing the latest developments. Some years ago, the Barcelona Charter was signed by a variety of international owner organizations of traditional vessels, and provides certain accepted minimum criteria for the restoration and operation of traditional watercraft still in operation.

Another consideration is the distinction between a &quot;real&quot; museum ship, and a ship replica. As repairs accumulate over time, less and less of the ship is of the original materials, and the lack of old parts (or even &quot;appropriate&quot; work tools) may lead to the use of modern &quot;short-cuts&quot; (such as welding a metal plate instead of riveting it, as would be the case during the ships&#x27; historical period). Visitors without historical background are also often unable to distinguish between a historical museum ship and a (more-or-less historically relevant) ship replica, which may serve solely as a tourist attraction.

==Museum usage==

Typically the visitor enters via gangplank, wanders around on the deck, then goes below, usually using the original stairways, giving a sense of how the crew got around. The interior features restored but inactivated equipment, enhanced with mementos including old photographs, explanatory displays, pages from the ship&#x27;s logs, menus, and the like. Some add recorded sound effects, audio tours or video displays to enhance the experience. 

In some cases, the ships radio room has been brought back into use, with volunteers operating amateur radio equipment. Often, the callsign assigned is a variation on the original identification of the ship. For example, the submarine , which had the callsign NBQV, is now on the air as NB9QV. The World War II submarine , berthed at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, had the active service callsign NJVT and is now on the air as NJ6VT. In other cases, such as , a distinctive call (in this case KH6BB) is used. This radio work not only helps restore part of the vessel, but also provides worldwide publicity for the museum ship.

A number of the larger museum ships have begun to offer hosting for weddings, meetings, other events, and sleepovers, and on a few ships still seaworthy, cruises. In the United States, this includes s annual &quot;turnaround&quot;, when the old ship is towed out into the harbor and brought back in facing the other way, so as to weather evenly. A place on the deck is by invitation or lottery only, and highly prized.

Many consider the tourism appeal of an interesting old vessel on the city waterfront strong enough that any port city should showcase one or more museum ships. This may even include building a replica ship at great expense.

<doc id="198030" wikidata="Q189764" url="?curid=198030" title="Pont du Gard">
<text>The Pont du Gard is an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge built in the first century AD to carry water over to the Roman colony of &quot;Nemausus&quot; (Nîmes). It crosses the river Gardon near the town of Vers-Pont-du-Gard in southern France. The Pont du Gard is one of the best preserved Roman aqueduct bridges. It was added to UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage sites in 1985 because of its exceptional preservation, historical importance, and architectural ingenuity.

==Description==
The bridge has three tiers of arches made from Shelly limestone and stands high. The aqueduct formerly carried an estimated of water a day over to the fountains, baths and homes of the citizens of Nîmes. The structure&#x27;s precise construction allowed an average gradient of in . It may have been in use as late as the 6th century, with some parts used for significantly longer, but lack of maintenance after the 4th century led to clogging by mineral deposits and debris that eventually stopped the flow of water.

After the Roman Empire collapsed and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact with a secondary function as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, with a right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river. Over time, some of its stone blocks were looted, and serious damage was inflicted in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination. A series of renovations between the 18th and 21st centuries, commissioned by local authorities and the French state, culminated in 2000 with opening of a new visitor centre and removal of traffic and buildings from the bridge and area immediately around it. Today it is one of France&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions, and has attracted the attention of a succession of literary and artistic visitors.

=== Route of the Nîmes aqueduct ===

The location of &quot;Nemausus&quot; (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient when it came to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city&#x27;s south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around &quot;Ucetia&quot; (Uzès), where there are natural springs.

The Nîmes aqueduct was built to channel water from the springs of the Fontaine d&#x27;Eure near Uzès to the &quot;castellum divisorum&quot; (repartition basin) in Nemausus. From there, it was distributed to fountains, baths and private homes around the city. The straight-line distance between the two is only about , but the aqueduct takes a winding route measuring around . This was necessary to circumvent the southernmost foothills of the Massif Central, known as the . They are difficult to cross, as they are covered in dense vegetation and garrigue and indented by deep valleys. It was impractical for the Romans to attempt to tunnel through the hills, as it would have required a tunnel of between , depending on the starting point. A roughly V-shaped course around the eastern end of the Garrigues de Nîmes was therefore the only practical way of transporting the water from the spring to the city.

The Fontaine d&#x27;Eure, at above sea level, is only higher than the repartition basin in Nîmes, but this provided a sufficient gradient to sustain a steady flow of water to the 50,000 inhabitants of the Roman city. The aqueduct&#x27;s average gradient is only 1 in 3,000. It varies widely along its course, but is as little as 1 in 20,000 in some sections. The Pont du Gard itself descends in , a gradient of 1 in 18,241. The average gradient between the start and end of the aqueduct is far shallower than was usual for Roman aqueducts – only about a tenth of the average gradient of some of the aqueducts in Rome.

The reason for the disparity in gradients along the aqueduct&#x27;s route is that a uniform gradient would have meant that the Pont du Gard would have been infeasibly high, given the limitations of the technology of the time. By varying the gradient along the route, the aqueduct&#x27;s engineers were able to lower the height of the bridge by to above the river – still exceptionally high by Roman standards, but within acceptable limits. This height limit governed the profile and gradients of the entire aqueduct, but it came at the price of creating a &quot;sag&quot; in the middle of the aqueduct. The gradient profile before the Pont du Gard is relatively steep, descending at per kilometre, but thereafter it descends by only over the remaining . In one section, the winding route between the Pont du Gard and St Bonnet required an extraordinary degree of accuracy from the Roman engineers, who had to allow for a fall of only per of the conduit.
It is estimated that the aqueduct supplied the city with around of water a day that took nearly 27 hours to flow from the source to the city. The water arrived in the &quot;castellum divisorum&quot; at Nîmes – an open, shallow, circular basin 5.5 m in diameter by 1 m deep. It would have been surrounded by a balustrade within some sort of enclosure, probably under some kind of small but elaborate pavilion. When it was excavated, traces of a tiled roof, Corinthian columns and a fresco decorated with fish and dolphins were discovered in a fragmentary condition. The aqueduct water entered through an opening wide, and ten large holes in the facing wall, each wide, directed the water into the city&#x27;s main water pipes. Three large drains were also located in the floor, possibly to enable the nearby amphitheatre to be flooded rapidly to enable &quot;naumachia&quot; (mock naval battles) to be held.

The spring still exists and is now the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in dissolved calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by &quot;circitores&quot;, workers responsible for the aqueduct&#x27;s upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.

Much of the Nîmes aqueduct was built underground, as was typical of Roman aqueducts. It was constructed by digging a trench in which a stone channel was built and enclosed by an arched roof of stone slabs, which was then covered with earth. Some sections of the channel are tunnelled through solid rock. In all, of the aqueduct was constructed below the ground. The remainder had to be carried on the surface through conduits set on a wall or on arched bridges. Some substantial remains of the above-ground works can still be seen today, such as the so-called &quot;Pont Rue&quot; that stretches for hundreds of metres around Vers and still stands up to high. Other surviving parts include the Pont de Bornègre, three arches carrying the aqueduct across a stream; the Pont de Sartanette, near the Pont du Gard, which covers across a small valley; and three sections of aqueduct tunnel near Sernhac, measuring up to long. However, the Pont du Gard is by far the best-preserved section of the entire aqueduct.

=== Description of the bridge ===
Built on three levels, the Pont is high above the river at low water and long. Its width varies from at the bottom to at the top. The three levels of arches are recessed, with the main piers in line one above another. The span of the arches varies slightly, as each was constructed independently to provide flexibility to protect against subsidence. Each level has a differing number of arches:

The first level of the Pont du Gard adjoins a road bridge that was added in the 18th century. The water conduit or &quot;specus&quot;, which is about high and wide, is carried at the top of the third level. The upper levels of the bridge are slightly curved in the upstream direction. It was long believed that the engineers had designed it this way deliberately to strengthen the bridge&#x27;s structure against the flow of water, like a dam wall. However, a microtopographic survey carried out in 1989 showed that the bend is caused by the stone expanding and contracting by about a day under the heat of the sun. Over the centuries, this process has produced the current deformation.

The Pont du Gard was constructed largely without the use of mortar or clamps. It contains an estimated 50,400 tons of limestone with a volume of some ; some of the individual blocks weigh up to 6 tons. Most of the stone was extracted from the local quarry of Estel located approximately downstream, on the banks of the Gardon River. The coarse-grained soft reddish shelly limestone, known locally as &quot;Pierre de Vers&quot;, lends itself very well to dimension stone production. The blocks were precisely cut to fit perfectly together by friction and gravity, eliminating the need for mortar. The builders also left inscriptions on the stonework conveying various messages and instructions. Many blocks were numbered and inscribed with the required locations, such as &quot;fronte dextra&quot; or &quot;fronte sinistra&quot; (front right or front left), to guide the builders.

The method of construction is fairly well understood by historians. The patron of the aqueduct – a rich individual or the city of Nîmes itself – would have hired a large team of contractors and skilled labourers. A surveyor or &quot;mensor&quot; planned the route using a &quot;groma&quot; for sighting, the &quot;chorobates&quot; for levelling, and a set of measuring poles five or ten Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on &quot;wax tablets&quot;, later to be written up on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the water conduit was constructed.

The builders would have made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work could have been done using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years&#x27; pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.

Although the exterior of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with &quot;maltha&quot;, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.

Although the Pont du Gard is renowned for its appearance, its design is not optimal as the technique of stacking arches on top of each other is clumsy and inefficient (and therefore expensive) in the amount of materials it requires. Later aqueducts had a more sophisticated design, making greater use of concrete to reduce their volume and cost of construction. The Aqueduct bridge of Segovia and the Pont de les Ferreres are of roughly similar length but use far fewer arches. Roman architects were eventually able to do away with &quot;stacking&quot; altogether. The Acueducto de los Milagros in Mérida, Spain and the Chabet Ilelouine aqueduct bridge, near Cherchell, Algeria utilise tall, slender piers, constructed from top to bottom with concrete-faced masonry and brick.

== History ==
The construction of the aqueduct has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus&#x27;s son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Espérandieu, writing in 1926, linked the construction of the aqueduct with Agrippa&#x27;s visit to Narbonensis in that year. Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the Nîmes aqueduct, and coins discovered in the outflow in Nîmes are no older than the reign of the emperor Claudius (41–54 AD). On this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the aqueduct must have been completed around the middle of the 1st century AD. It is believed to have taken about fifteen years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.

From the 4th century onwards, the aqueduct&#x27;s maintenance was neglected as successive waves of invaders disrupted the region. It became clogged with debris, encrustations and plant roots, greatly reducing the flow of the water. The resulting deposits in the conduit, consisting of layers of dirt and organic material, are up to thick on each wall. An analysis of the deposits originally suggested that it had continued to supply water to Nîmes until as late as the 9th century, but more recent investigations suggest that it had gone out of use by about the sixth century, though parts of it may have continued to be used for significantly longer.
Although some of its stones were plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge across the valley. In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uzès the right to levy tolls on those using the bridge. The right later passed to the Bishops of Uzès. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the bridge in good repair. However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the bridge, the duke had one side of the second row of arches cut away to a depth of about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide enough to accommodate carts and cannons, but severely weakened the bridge in the process.

In 1703 the local authorities renovated the Pont du Gard to repair cracks, fill in ruts and replace the stones lost in the previous century. A new bridge was built by the engineer Henri Pitot in 1743–47 next to the arches of the lower level, so that the road traffic could cross on a purpose-built bridge. The novelist Alexandre Dumas was strongly critical of the construction of the new bridge, commenting that &quot;it was reserved for the eighteenth century to dishonour a monument which the barbarians of the fifth had not dared to destroy.&quot; The Pont du Gard continued to deteriorate and by the time Prosper Mérimée saw it in 1835 it was at serious risk of collapse from erosion and the loss of stonework.

Napoleon III, who had a great admiration for all things Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close interest in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisné to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855 and 1858, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed at one end and the conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.

There have been a number of subsequent projects to consolidate the piers and arches of the Pont du Gard. It has survived three serious floods over the last century; in 1958 the whole of the lower tier was submerged by a giant flood that washed away other bridges, and in 1998 another major flood affected the area. A further flood struck in 2002, badly damaging nearby installations.

The Pont du Gard was added to UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites in 1985 on the criteria of &quot;Human creative genius; testimony to cultural tradition; significance to human history&quot;. The description on the list states: &quot;The hydraulic engineers and ... architects who conceived this bridge created a technical as well as artistic masterpiece.&quot;

== Tourism ==

The Pont du Gard has been a tourist attraction for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge&#x27;s masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeyman masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), many of whom have left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.

The bridge has had a long association with French monarchs seeking to associate themselves with a symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted with a grand entertainment laid on by the vicomte d&#x27;Uzès. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits. A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to Nîmes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France to hang in the king&#x27;s new dining room at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past. Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge&#x27;s restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.
By the 1990s the Pont du Gard had become a hugely popular tourist attraction but was congested with traffic – vehicles were still allowed to drive over the 1743 road bridge – and was cluttered with illegally built structures and tourist shops lining the river banks. As the architect Jean-Paul Viguier put it, the &quot;appetite for gain&quot; had transformed the Pont du Gard into &quot;a fairground attraction&quot;. In 1996 the General Council of the Gard &quot;département&quot; began a major four-year project to improve the area, sponsored by the French government, in conjunction with local sources, UNESCO and the EU. The entire area around the bridge was pedestrianised and a new visitor centre was built on the north bank to a design by Jean-Paul Viguier. The redevelopment has ensured that the area around the Pont du Gard is now much quieter due to the removal of vehicle traffic, and the new museum provides a much improved historical context for visitors. The Pont du Gard is today one of France&#x27;s top five tourist attractions, with 1.4 million visitors reported in 2001.

=== Literary visitors ===
Since it became a tourist destination, many novelists and writers have visited the Pont du Gard and written of the experience. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was overwhelmed when he first visited it in 1738:
The novelist Henry James, visiting in 1884, was similarly impressed; he described the Pont du Gard as &quot;unspeakably imposing, and nothing could well be more Roman.&quot; He commented:

The mid-19th-century writer Joseph Méry wrote in his 1853 book &quot;Les Nuits italiennes, contes nocturnes&quot; that on seeing the Pont du Gard:

Hilaire Belloc wrote in 1928 that:

<text>Vitaly Ivanovich Sevastyanov (; 8 July 1935 – 5 April 2010) was a Soviet cosmonaut and an engineer who flew on the Soyuz 9 and Soyuz 18 missions.

He trained as an engineer at the Moscow Aviation Institute and after graduation in 1959, joined Sergey Korolev&#x27;s design bureau, where he worked on the design of the Vostok spacecraft. He also lectured at the Cosmonaut Training Centre, teaching the physics of spaceflight. In 1967 he commenced cosmonaut training himself. Between 15 and 24 September 1972 he Sevastyanov visited Zagreb, Yugoslavia.

After two successful missions, including a two-month stay on the Salyut 4 space station, he was pulled from active flight status in 1976. He worked in ground control for the Salyut 6 station before returning to spacecraft design in the 1980s to work on the Buran project.

In 1971, he was the backup Flight Engineer for the ill-fated Soyuz 11 Mission, which ended in disaster when the craft depressurized above the Kármán line, killing the three man crew.

He was president of the Soviet Chess Federation from 1977 to 1986 and from 1988 to 1989.

During the 1980s he was the host of a popular television program on space exploration entitled &quot;Man, Earth, Universe&quot;.

In 1993, he left the space programme and was elected to the State Duma in 1994.

Sevastyanov, along with Aleksey Leonov, Rusty Schweickart and Georgy Grechko established the Association of Space Explorers in 1984. Membership is open to all people who have flown in outer space.

He died in Moscow on 5 April 2010, aged 74.

<text>Cranes are a type of large bird with long legs and necks in the biological family Gruidae of the order Gruiformes. The family has 15 species placed in four genera which are &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Balearica&quot;, &quot;Leucogeranus&quot;, and &quot;Grus&quot;. They are large birds with long necks and legs, a tapering form, and long secondary feathers on the wing that project over the tail. Most species have muted gray or white plumages, marked with black, and red bare patches on the face, but the crowned cranes of the genus &quot;Balearica&quot; have vibrantly-coloured wings and golden &quot;crowns&quot; of feathers. Cranes fly with their necks extended outwards instead of bent into an S-shape and their long legs outstretched.

Cranes live on most continents, with the exception of Antarctica and South America. Some species and populations of cranes migrate over long distances; others do not migrate at all. Cranes are solitary during the breeding season, occurring in pairs, but during the non-breeding season, most species are gregarious, forming large flocks where their numbers are sufficient.

They are opportunistic feeders that change their diets according to the season and their own nutrient requirements. They eat a range of items from small rodents, eggs of birds, fish, amphibians, and insects to grain and berries. Cranes construct platform nests in shallow water, and typically lay a clutch of two eggs at a time. Both parents help to rear the young, which remain with them until the next breeding season. Most species of cranes have been affected by human activities and are at the least classified as threatened, if not critically endangered. The plight of the whooping cranes of North America inspired some of the first US legislation to protect endangered species.

== Description ==
Cranes are very large birds, often considered the world&#x27;s tallest flying birds. They range in size from the demoiselle crane, which measures in length, to the sarus crane, which can be up to , although the heaviest is the red-crowned crane, which can weigh prior to migrating. They are long-legged and long-necked birds with streamlined bodies and large, rounded wings. The males and females do not vary in external appearance, but males tend to be slightly larger than females.

The plumage of cranes varies by habitat. Species inhabiting vast, open wetlands tend to have more white in their plumage than do species that inhabit smaller wetlands or forested habitats, which tend to be more grey. These white species are also generally larger. The smaller size and colour of the forest species is thought to help them maintain a less conspicuous profile while nesting; two of these species (the common and sandhill cranes) also daub their feathers with mud which some observers suspect helps them to hide while nesting.

Most crane species have bare patches of skin on their heads and can expand the patches in order to communicate aggression. Species lacking these bare patches use specialized feather tufts to signal similar information. 

Also important to communication is the position and length of the trachea. In the two crowned cranes, the trachea is shorter and only slightly impressed upon the bone of the sternum, whereas the trachea of the other species are longer and penetrate the sternum. In some species, the entire sternum is fused to the bony plates of the trachea, and this helps amplify the crane&#x27;s calls, allowing them to carry for several kilometres.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==


The family name Gruidae comes from the genus Grus, this genus name is obtained from the epithet of the common crane which is &quot;Ardea grus&quot;, it is named by Carl Linnaeus from the Latin word &quot;grus&quot; meaning &quot;crane&quot;.

The 15 living species of cranes are placed in four genera. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus &quot;Grus&quot;, as then defined, was polyphyletic. In the resulting rearrangement to create monophyletic genera, the Siberian crane was moved to the resurrected monotypic genus &quot;Leucogeranus&quot;, while the sandhill crane, the white-naped crane, the sarus crane, and the brolga were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Antigone&quot;. Some authorities recognize the additional genera &quot;Anthropoides&quot; (for the demoiselle crane and blue crane) and &quot;Bugeranus&quot; (for the wattled crane).

The following cladogram is based on a molecular phylogenetic study by Carey Krajewski and collaborators that was published in 2010.
==Evolution==
The fossil record of cranes is incomplete. Apparently, the subfamilies were well distinct by the Late Eocene (around 35 mya). The present genera are apparently some 20 mya old. Biogeography of known fossil and the living taxa of cranes suggests that the group is probably of (Laurasian?) Old World origin. The extant diversity at the genus level is centered on (eastern) Africa, although no fossil record exists from there. On the other hand, it is peculiar that numerous fossils of Ciconiiformes are documented from there; these birds presumably shared much of their habitat with cranes back then already. Cranes are sister taxa to Eogruidae, a lineage of flightless birds; as predicted by the fossil record of true cranes, eogruids were native to the Old World. A species of true crane, &quot;Antigone cubensis&quot;, has similarly become flightless and ratite-like.

Fossil genera are tentatively assigned to the present-day subfamilies:

Gruinae
* &quot;Palaeogrus&quot; (Middle Eocene of Germany and Italy – Middle Miocene of France)
* &quot;Pliogrus&quot; (Early Pliocene of Eppelsheim, Germany)
* &quot;Camusia&quot; (Late Miocene of Menorca, Mediterranean)
* &quot;&quot;Grus&quot; conferta&quot; (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of Contra Costa County, US)
Sometimes considered Balearicinae
* &quot;Geranopsis&quot; (Hordwell Late Eocene – Early Oligocene of England)
* &quot;Anserpica&quot; (Late Oligocene of France)
Sometimes considered Gruidae &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
* &quot;Eobalearica&quot; (Ferghana Late? Eocene of Ferghana, Uzbekistan)
* &quot;Probalearica&quot; (Late Oligocene? – Middle Pliocene of Florida, US, France?, Moldavia and Mongolia) – A &quot;nomen dubium&quot;?
* &quot;Aramornis&quot; (Sheep Creek Middle Miocene of Snake Creek Quarries, US)

==Distribution and habitat==
The cranes have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring across most of the world continents. They are absent from Antarctica and, mysteriously, South America. East Asia has the highest crane diversity, with eight species, followed by Africa, which is home to five resident species and wintering populations of a sixth. Australia, Europe, and North America have two regularly occurring species each. Of the four crane genera, &quot;Balearica&quot; (two species) is restricted to Africa, and &quot;Leucogeranus&quot; (one species) is restricted to Asia; the other two genera, &quot;Grus&quot; (including &quot;Anthropoides&quot; and &quot;Bugeranus&quot;) and &quot;Antigone&quot;, are both widespread.

Many species of cranes are dependent on wetlands and grasslands, and most species nest in shallow wetlands. Some species nest in wetlands, but move their chicks up onto grasslands or uplands to feed (while returning to wetlands at night), whereas others remain in wetlands for the entirety of the breeding season. Even the demoiselle crane and blue crane, which may nest and feed in grasslands (or even arid grasslands or deserts), require wetlands for roosting at night. The Sarus Crane in south Asia is unique in having a significant breeding population using agricultural fields to breed in areas alongside very high density of humans and intensive farming, largely due to the positive attitudes of farmers towards the cranes. In Australia, the Brolga occurs in the breeding areas of Sarus Cranes in Queensland state, and they achieve sympatry by using different habitats. Sarus Cranes in Queensland largely live in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;-dominated riverine, while most Brolgas use non-wooded regional ecosystems that include vast grassland habitats. The only two species that do not always roost in wetlands are the two African crowned cranes (&quot;Balearica&quot;), which are the only cranes to roost in trees.

Some crane species are sedentary, remaining in the same area throughout the year, while others are highly migratory, traveling thousands of kilometres each year from their breeding sites. A few species like Sarus Cranes have both migratory and sedentary populations, and healthy sedentary populations have a large proportion of cranes that are not territorial, breeding pairs.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The cranes are diurnal birds that vary in their sociality by season and location. During the breeding season, they are territorial and usually remain on their territory all the time. In contrast in the non-breeding season, they tend to be gregarious, forming large flocks to roost, socialize, and in some species feed. Sarus Crane breeding pairs maintain territories throughout the year in south Asia, and non-breeding birds live in flocks that can also be seen throughout the year. Large aggregations of cranes likely increase safety for individual cranes when resting and flying and also increase chances for young unmated birds to meet partners.

===Calls and communication===
Cranes are highly vocal and have several specialized calls. The vocabulary begins soon after hatching with low, purring calls for maintaining contact with their parents, as well as food-begging calls. Other calls used as chicks include alarm calls and &quot;flight intention&quot; calls, both of which are maintained into adulthood. Cranes are noticed the most due to their loud duet calls that can be used to distinguish individual pairs. Sarus crane trios produce synchronized unison calls called &quot;triets&quot; whose structure is identical to duets of normal pairs, but have a lower frequency.

===Feeding===

The cranes consume a wide range of food, both animal and plant matter. When feeding on land, they consume seeds, leaves, nuts and acorns, berries, fruit, insects, worms, snails, small reptiles, mammals, and birds. In wetlands and agriculture fields, roots, rhizomes, tubers, and other parts of emergent plants, other molluscs, small fish, eggs of birds and amphibians are also consumed, as well. The exact composition of the diet varies by location, season, and availability. Within the wide range of items consumed, some patterns are suggested but require specific investigation to confirm; the shorter-billed species usually feed in drier uplands, while the longer-billed species feed in wetlands.

Cranes employ different foraging techniques for different food types and in different habitats. Tubers and rhizomes are dug for and a crane digging for them remains in place for some time digging and then expanding a hole to prise them out of the soil. In contrast both to this and the stationary wait and watch hunting methods employed by many herons, they forage for insects and animal prey by slowly moving forwards with their heads lowered and probing with their bills.

Where more than one species of cranes exists in a locality, each species adopts separate niches to minimise competition. At one important lake in Jiangxi Province in China, the Siberian cranes feed on the mudflats and in shallow water, the white-naped cranes on the wetland borders, the hooded cranes on sedge meadows, and the last two species also feed on the agricultural fields along with the common cranes. In Australia, where Sarus Cranes live alongside Brolgas, they have different diets: Sarus Cranes&#x27; diet consisted of diverse vegetation, while Brolga diet spanned a much wider range of trophic levels. Some crane species such as the Common/ Eurasian crane use a kleptoparasitic strategy to recover from temporary reductions in feeding rate, particularly when the rate is below the threshold of intake necessary for survival. Accumulated intake of during daytime shows a typical anti-sigmoid shape, with greatest increases of intake after dawn and before dusk.

===Breeding===

Cranes are perennially monogamous breeders, establishing long-term pair bonds that may last the lifetime of the birds. Pair bonds begin to form in the second or third years of life, but several years pass before the first successful breeding season. Initial breeding attempts often fail, and in many cases, newer pair bonds dissolve (divorce) after unsuccessful breeding attempts. Pairs that are repeatedly successful at breeding remain together for as long as they continue to do so. In a study of sandhill cranes in Florida, seven of the 22 pairs studied remained together for an 11-year period. Of the pairs that separated, 53% was due to the death of one of the pair, 18% was due to divorce, and the fate of 29% of pairs was unknown. Similar results had been found by acoustic monitoring (sonography/frequency analysis of duet and guard calls) in three breeding areas of common cranes in Germany over 10 years.

Cranes are territorial and generally seasonal breeders. Seasonality varies both between and within species, depending on local conditions. Migratory species begin breeding upon reaching their summer breeding grounds, between April and June. The breeding season of tropical species is usually timed to coincide with the wet or monsoon seasons. Artificial sources of water such as irrigation canals and irregular rainfall can sometimes provide adequate moisture to maintain wetland habitat outside the normal wet season, and allows for occasional aseasonal nesting throughout the year in few tropical species.

Territory sizes also vary depending on location. Tropical species can maintain very small territories, for example sarus cranes in India can breed on territories as small as one hectare where the area is of sufficient quality and disturbance by humans is minimal. Even in areas with a high density of humans, in the absence of directed persecution, species like Sarus Crane maintain territories as small as 5 ha when agricultural crops and landscape conditions are suitable. In contrast, red-crowned crane territories may require 500 hectares, and pairs may defend even larger territories than that, up to several thousand hectares. Territory defence is either acoustic with both birds performing the unison call, or more rarely, physical with attacks usually by the male. Because of this, females are much less likely to retain the territory than males in the event of the death of a partner. Rarely, breeding territorial crane pairs allow a third crane into the territory to form polygynous or polyandrous trios that improves the chances of survival of the pair&#x27;s chicks. Trios of Sarus cranes were seen largely in marginal habitats and third birds were young suggesting that third cranes would benefit by gaining experience.

== In mythology and symbolism ==


The cranes&#x27; beauty and spectacular mating dances have made them highly symbolic birds in many cultures with records dating back to ancient times. Crane mythology can be found in cultures around the world, from India to the Aegean, Arabia, China, Korea, Japan, Australia, and North America. 

The Sanskrit epic poet Valmiki was inspired to write the first &quot;śloka&quot; couplet by the pathos of seeing a male sarus crane shot while dancing with its mate. 

In Mecca, in pre-Islamic Arabia, Allāt, Uzza, and Manāt were believed to be the three chief goddesses of Mecca, they were called the &quot;three exalted cranes&quot; (, an obscure word on which &#x27;crane&#x27; is the usual gloss). See &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; for the best-known story regarding these three goddesses.

The Greek for crane is (), which gives us the cranesbill, or geranium, which is so named for the resemblance between the fruit of some species and the head and bill of a crane. The crane was a bird of omen in Greek mythology. In the tale of Ibycus and the cranes, a thief attacked Ibycus (a poet of the sixth century BCE) and left him for dead. Ibycus called to a flock of passing cranes to spread the word of his murder, and the Eumenides subsequently summon these cranes to fly over a crowd of mourners calling for Ibycus to be avenged. At the sight of the cranes the killer calls them &quot;the cranes of Ibycus,&quot; which is identified as a confession of guilt by crowd, and the killer is dragged off to be judged.

Pliny the Elder wrote that cranes would appoint one of their number to stand guard while they slept. The sentry would hold a stone in its claw, so that if it fell asleep, it would drop the stone and waken. A crane holding a stone in its claw is a well-known symbol in heraldry, and is known as a crane in its vigilance. Notably, however, the crest of Clan Cranstoun depicts a sleeping crane still in vigilance and holding the rock in its raised claw.

Aristotle describes the migration of cranes in the &quot;History of Animals&quot;, adding an account of their fights with Pygmies as they wintered near the source of the Nile. Battles between cranes and dwarf peoples, or geranomachy, is a widespread motif of antiquity and come from China and Arabia at least from the fifth century. Aristotle describes as untruthful an account that the crane carries a touchstone inside it that can be used to test for gold when vomited up.

Greek and Roman myths often portrayed the dance of cranes as a love of joy and a celebration of life, and the crane was often associated with both Apollo and Hephaestus.

In pre-modern Ottoman Empire, sultans would sometimes present a piece of crane feather (Turkish: ) to soldiers of any group in the army (janissaries, sipahis, etc.) who performed heroically during a battle. Soldiers would attach this feather to their caps or headgear which would give them some sort of a rank among their peers.

Throughout Asia, the crane is a symbol of happiness and eternal youth. In China, several styles of kung fu take inspiration from the movements of cranes in the wild, the most famous of these styles being Wing Chun, Hung Gar (tiger crane), and the Shaolin Five Animals style of fighting. Crane movements are well known for their fluidity and grace. 

In Japan, the crane is one of the mystical or holy creatures (others include the dragon and the tortoise) and symbolizes good fortune and longevity because of its fabled life span of a thousand years. The crane is one of the subjects in the tradition of &quot;origami&quot;, or paper folding. An ancient Japanese legend promises that anyone who folds a thousand origami cranes will be granted a wish by a crane. In northern Hokkaidō, the women of the Ainu people performed a crane dance that was captured in 1908 in a photograph by Arnold Genthe. After World War II, the crane came to symbolize peace and the innocent victims of war through the story of schoolgirl Sadako Sasaki and her thousand origami cranes. Suffering from leukemia as a result of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and knowing she was dying, she undertook to make a thousand origami cranes before her death at the age of 12. After her death, she became internationally recognised as a symbol of the innocent victims of war and remains a heroine to many Japanese girls.

<text>Southern Min (), Minnan ( ) or Banlam (), is a group of linguistically similar and historically related Chinese languages that form a branch of Min Chinese spoken in Fujian (especially the Minnan region), most of Taiwan (many citizens are descendants of settlers from Fujian), Eastern Guangdong, Hainan, and Southern Zhejiang. Southern Min dialects are also spoken by descendants of emigrants from these areas in diaspora, most notably in Southeast Asia, such as Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Southern Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Southern and Central Vietnam, as well as major cities in the United States, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. Minnan is the most widely-spoken branch of Min, with approximately 50.6 million speakers as of 2021.

The most widely spoken Southern Min language is Hokkien, which includes Taiwanese.
Other varieties of Southern Min have significant differences from Hokkien, some having limited mutual intelligibility with it, others almost none. Teochew, Longyan, and Zhenan are said to have general mutual intelligibility with Hokkien, sharing similar phonology and vocabulary to a large extent. On the other hand, variants such as Datian, Zhongshan, and Qiong-Lei have historical linguistic roots with Hokkien, but are significantly divergent from it in terms of phonology and vocabulary, and thus have almost no mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. Linguists tend to classify them as separate languages.

==Geographic distribution==
===Mainland China===
Southern Min dialects are spoken in southern Fujian, specifically in the cities of Xiamen, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and much of Longyan, hence the name. In addition, varieties of Southern Min are spoken in several southeastern counties of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, the Zhoushan archipelago off Ningbo in Zhejiang, the town of Sanxiang at the southern periphery of Zhongshan in Guangdong, and in the Chaoshan (Teo-swa) region in Guangdong. 

The variant spoken in Leizhou, Guangdong as well as in Hainan is classified as Hainanese and is not mutually intelligible with mainstream Southern Min or Teochew. Hainanese is classified in some schemes as part of Southern Min and in other schemes as separate.

Puxian Min was originally based on the Quanzhou dialect, but over time became heavily influenced by Eastern Min, eventually losing intelligibility with Southern Min.

===Taiwan===
The Southern Min dialects spoken in Taiwan, collectively known as Taiwanese, is a first language for most of the Hoklo people, the main ethnicity of Taiwan. The correspondence between language and ethnicity is not absolute, as some Hoklo have very limited proficiency in Southern Min while some non-Hoklo speak Southern Min fluently.

===Southeast Asia===
There are many Southern Min speakers among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Many ethnic Chinese immigrants to the region were Hoklo from southern Fujian and brought the language to what is now present-day Malaysia and Singapore (formerly British Malaya, the Straits Settlements, and British Borneo), Indonesia (the former Dutch East Indies), the Philippines (former Spanish East Indies and later, US Philippine Islands (P.I.)), Brunei (former part of British Borneo), Southern Thailand, Myanmar (British Burma), Cambodia (former French Cambodia of French Indochina), Southern Vietnam (former French Cochinchina of French Indochina) and Central Vietnam (former French Annam of French Indochina). In general, Southern Min from southern Fujian is known as Hokkien, Hokkienese, Fukien, or Fookien in Southeast Asia and is mostly mutually intelligible with Hokkien spoken elsewhere. Many Southeast Asian ethnic Chinese also originated in the Chaoshan region of Guangdong and speak Teochew language, the variant of Southern Min from that region, particularly Thailand, Cambodia, Southern Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, etc. In the Philippines, Philippine Hokkien is reportedly the native or heritage language of up to 98.7% of the Chinese Filipino community in the Philippines, among whom it is known in Hokkien .

Southern Min speakers form the majority of Chinese in Singapore, with Hokkien being the largest group and the second largest being Teochew. Despite the similarities, the two groups are rarely viewed together as &quot;Southern Min&quot;.

==Classification==
The variants of Southern Min spoken in Zhejiang province are most akin to that spoken in Quanzhou. The variants spoken in Taiwan are similar to the three Fujian variants and are collectively known as Taiwanese.

Those Southern Min variants that are collectively known as &quot;Hokkien&quot; in Southeast Asia also originate from these variants. The variants of Southern Min in the Chaoshan region of eastern Guangdong province are collectively known as Teo-Swa or Chaoshan. Chaoshan Min is of great importance in the Southeast Asian Chinese diaspora, particularly in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Sumatra, and West Kalimantan. The Philippines variant is mostly from the Quanzhou area as most of their forefathers are from the aforementioned area.

The Southern Min language variant spoken around Shanwei and Haifeng differs markedly from Teochew and may represent a later migration from Zhangzhou. Linguistically, it lies between Teochew and Amoy. In southwestern Fujian, the local variants in Longyan and Zhangping form a separate division of Southern Min on their own. Among ethnic Chinese inhabitants of Penang, Malaysia and Medan, Indonesia, a distinct form based on the Zhangzhou dialect has developed. In Penang, it is called Penang Hokkien while across the Malacca Strait in Medan, an almost identical variant is known as Medan Hokkien.

==Varieties==
There are two or three divisions of Southern Min, depending on the criteria for Leizhou and Hainanese inclusion:
*Southern Min
** Hokkien under the Quanzhang division ()
** Teochew, Swatow, Jieyang, Haklau Min under the Chaoshan division ()
** Leizhou and Hainanese dialects under the Qiong-Lei division ().
More recently, Kwok (2018: 157) has proposed an alternative classification, with a divergent Northern branch that includes Quanzhou dialect but not Zhangzhou dialect, as shown below:
*Southern Min
**Northern
***Cangnan
***Quanzhou, Zihu
**Central-Southern
***Central
****Zhangzhou
****Longyan, Datian
***Southern
****Guangdong
*****? Haifeng
*****Jieyang, Chaoyang
****Hainan
*****Leizhou
*****Haikou
===Hokkien===

Hokkien is the most widely spoken form of Southern Min, including Amoy dialect and Taiwanese. Both of these developed as a combination of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou speech.
Varieties in South-East Asia include Singaporean Hokkien, Penang Hokkien, Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien, Medan Hokkien, and Philippine Hokkien.

===Chaoshan (Teo-Swa)===

Teo-Swa or Chaoshan speech () is a closely related variant of Southern Min that includes the Kekyeo dialect, Teochew and Swatow dialects, and some consider Haklau Min to also be part of. It has limited mutual intelligibility with Hokkien, though they share some cognates with each other. Chaoshan Min is significantly different from Hokkien in both pronunciation and vocabulary, and mutual intelligibility is difficult.

==Phonology==

Southern Min has one of the most diverse phonologies of Chinese varieties, with more consonants than Mandarin or Cantonese. Vowels, on the other hand, are more-or-less similar to those of Mandarin. In general, Southern Min dialects have five to six tones, and tone sandhi is extensive. There are minor variations within Hokkien, and the Teochew system differs somewhat more.

Southern Min&#x27;s nasal finals consist of , , , and .

===Sino-Xenic comparisons===

Southern Min can trace its origins through the Tang dynasty, and it also has roots from earlier periods. Hokkien people call themselves &quot;Tang people&quot;, (&quot;&quot; /) which is synonymous to &quot;Chinese people&quot;. Because of the widespread influence of the Tang culture during the Great Tang dynasty, there are today still many Southern Min pronunciations of words shared by the Sino-xenic pronunciations of Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese languages.

==Writing systems==
Both Hokkien and Chaoshan (Teochew and Shantou dialects) have romanized writing systems and also respective Chinese characters. In mainland China, it is known as 閩南文 (Bân-lâm-bûn), while in Taiwan, it is known as 台文 (Tâi-bûn). The Han Chinese characters are known in mainland China and Taiwan as 漢字 (Hàn-jī / Hàn-lī). In Malaysia and Singapore, the Chinese characters are sometimes known as 唐儂字 / 唐人字 (Tn̂g-lâng-jī / Tn̂g-lâng-lī). In the Philippines, the Chinese characters are known as 咱儂字 / 咱人字 (Lán-nâng-dī) or 漢文字 (Hàm-bûn-dī).

==History==
The Min homeland of Fujian was opened to Han Chinese settlement by the defeat of the Minyue state by the armies of Emperor Wu of Han in 110 BC. The area features rugged mountainous terrain, with short rivers that flow into the South China Sea. Most subsequent migration from north to south China passed through the valleys of the Xiang and Gan rivers to the west, so that Min varieties have experienced less northern influence than other southern groups. As a result, whereas most varieties of Chinese can be treated as derived from Middle Chinese, the language described by rhyme dictionaries such as the &quot;Qieyun&quot; (601 AD), Min varieties contain traces of older distinctions. Linguists estimate that the oldest layers of Min dialects diverged from the rest of Chinese around the time of the Han dynasty. However, significant waves of migration from the North China Plain occurred. These include:

* The Uprising of the Five Barbarians during the Jin dynasty, particularly the Disaster of Yongjia in 311 AD, caused a tide of immigration to the south.
* In 669, Chen Zheng and his son Chen Yuanguang from Gushi County in Henan set up a regional administration in Fujian to suppress an insurrection by the She people.
* Wang Chao, also from Gushi, moved south to Fujian and was appointed its governor in 893, near the end of the Tang dynasty, and brought tens of thousands of troops from Henan. In 909, following the fall of the Tang dynasty, his younger brother Wang Shenzhi founded the Min Kingdom, one of the Ten Kingdoms in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

Jerry Norman identifies four main layers in the vocabulary of modern Min varieties:

# A non-Chinese substratum from the original languages of Minyue, which Norman and Mei Tsu-lin believe were Austroasiatic.
# The earliest Chinese layer, brought to Fujian by settlers from Zhejiang to the north during the Han dynasty.
# A layer from the Northern and Southern Dynasties period, which is largely consistent with the phonology of the &quot;Qieyun&quot; dictionary.
# A literary layer based on the koiné of Chang&#x27;an, the capital of the Tang dynasty.

<text>USS &quot;New York City&quot; (SSN-696) was a and the only vessel of the United States Navy to be named specifically for New York City (as distinct from the U.S. state).

==History==
The contract to build &quot;New York City&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 24 January 1972 and her keel was laid down on 15 December 1973. She was launched on 18 June 1977 sponsored by Mrs. Rachel Line Schlesinger (née Mellinger), wife of former Secretary of Defence James R. Schlesinger, delivered to the Navy on 23 January 1979, and commissioned on 3 March 1979 with Commander James A. Ross in command.

&quot;New York City&quot; carried out four deployments to the western Pacific (WestPac) between 1981 and 1985, and participated in numerous fleet exercises during those periods. After undergoing a modernization overhaul at Pearl Harbor (December 1985 – February 1988), the boat deployed to the Northern Pacific (November–December 1988). She made a WestPac deployment in 1989, then a second Northern Pacific deployment in early 1990, and two WestPac deployments in 1991. &quot;New York City&quot; carried out eastern Pacific deployments in 1992 and 1993; and additional deployments to both the western and eastern Pacific in 1994–1995.

&quot;New York City&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 April 1997 and entered the Ship-Submarine Recycling Program at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, in Bremerton, Washington.

==Awards==
During her operational career, &quot;New York City&quot; received four Meritorious Unit Commendations, one Navy Expeditionary Medal, and one Secretary of the Navy Letter of Commendation.

<text>The common crane (Grus grus), also known as the Eurasian crane, is a bird of the family Gruidae, the cranes. A medium-sized species, it is the only crane commonly found in Europe besides the demoiselle crane (&quot;Grus virgo&quot;) and the Siberian crane (&quot;Leucogeranus leucogeranus&quot;) that only are regular in the far eastern part of the continent. Along with the sandhill crane (&quot;Antigone canadensis&quot;), demoiselle crane and the brolga (&quot;Antigone rubicunda&quot;), it is one of only four crane species not currently classified as threatened with extinction or conservation dependent on the species level. Despite the species&#x27; large numbers, local extinctions and extirpations have taken place in part of its range, and an ongoing reintroduction project is underway in the United Kingdom.

The first formal description of the common crane was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Ardea grus&quot;. The current genus &quot;Grus&quot; was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. &quot;Grus&quot; is the Latin word for a &quot;crane&quot;. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The common crane is a large, stately bird and a medium-sized crane. It is long with a wingspan. The body weight can range from , with the nominate subspecies averaging around and the eastern subspecies (&quot;G. g. lilfordi&quot;) averaging . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is long, the tarsus is and the exposed culmen is .

Males are slightly heavier and larger than females, with weight showing the largest sexual size dimorphism, followed by wing, central toe, and head length in adults and juveniles.

This species is slate-grey overall. The forehead and lores are blackish with a bare red crown and a white streak extending from behind the eyes to the upper back. The overall colour is darkest on the back and rump and palest on the breast and wings. The primaries, the tips of secondaries, the alula, the tip of the tail, and the edges of upper tail coverts are all black and the greater coverts droop into explosive plumes. This combination of colouration ultimately distinguishes it from similar species in Asia, like the hooded (&quot;G. monacha&quot;) and black-necked cranes (&quot;G. nigricollis&quot;). The juvenile has yellowish-brown tips to its body feathers and lacks the drooping wing feathers and the bright neck pattern of the adult, and has a fully feathered crown. Every two years, before migration, the adult common crane undergoes a complete moult, remaining flightless for six weeks, until the new feathers grow.

It has a loud trumpeting call, given in flight and display. The call is piercing and can be heard from a considerable distance. It has a dancing display, leaping with wings uplifted, described in detail below.

==Distribution==
The common crane breeds in Europe and across the Palearctic to Siberia. By far the largest breeding populations can be found in Russia, Finland and Sweden. It is a rare breeder in southern and western Europe, with larger numbers breeding in the central and eastern parts of the continent. It has reappeared in several western European countries where it had been extirpated as a breeding bird decades or even centuries ago, including the United Kingdom and, since 2021, the Republic of Ireland. In Russia, it breeds as far east at the Chukchi Peninsula. In Asia, the breeding range of the common crane extends as far south as northern China, Turkey and the Caucasus region.

The species is a migrant and common cranes that breed in Europe predominantly winter in Portugal, Spain and northern Africa. Autumn migration is from August to October in the breeding areas, but from late October to early December at the wintering sites. Spring migration starts in February at wintering sites up to early March, but from March through May at the breeding areas. Migration phenology of common cranes is changing due to climate change. Important staging areas occur anywhere from Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany to China (with a large one around the Caspian Sea) and many thousand cranes can be seen in one day in the Autumn. Some birds winter elsewhere in southern Europe, including Portugal and France. During mild winters, some may stay near their breeding locations year-round, even in northwestern Europe. Common cranes that breed in far eastern Europe, including European Russia, winter in the river valleys of Sudan, Ethiopia, Tunisia and Eritrea with smaller numbers in Turkey, northern Israel, Iraq and parts of Iran. The third major wintering region, primarily used by those breeding in central Russia, is in the northern half of the Indian subcontinent, including Pakistan. Minimal wintering also occurs in Burma, Vietnam and Thailand. Lastly, the easternmost breeders winter in eastern China, where they are often the most common crane. Migrating flocks fly in a &quot;V&quot; formation.

It is a rare visitor to Japan and Korea, mostly blown over from the Chinese wintering population, and is a rare vagrant to western North America, where birds are occasionally seen with flocks of migrating sandhill cranes.

==Habitat==

In Europe, the common crane predominantly breeds in boreal and taiga forest and mixed forests, from an elevation of sea-level to . In northern climes, it breeds in treeless moors, on bogs, or on dwarf heather habitats, usually where small lakes or pools are also found. In Sweden, breeders are usually found in small, swampy openings amongst pine forests, while in Germany, marshy wetlands are used. Breeding habitat used in Russia are similar, though they can be found nesting in less likely habitat such as steppe and even semi-desert, so long as water is near. Primarily, the largest number of common cranes are found breeding in wooded swamps, bogs and wetlands and seem to require quiet, peaceful environs with minimal human interference. They occur at low density as breeders even where common, typically ranging from 1 to 5 pairs per .

In winter, this species moves to flooded areas, shallow sheltered bays, and swampy meadows. During the flightless moulting period there is a need for shallow waters or high reed cover for concealment. Later, after the migration period, the birds winter regularly in open country, often on cultivated lands and sometimes also in savanna-like areas, for example on the Iberian Peninsula.

==Behaviour==

===Diet===
The common crane is omnivorous, as are all cranes. It largely eats plant matter, including roots, rhizomes, tubers, stems, leaves, fruits and seeds. They also commonly eat, when available, pond-weeds, heath berries, peas, potatoes, olives, acorns, cedar nuts and pods of peanuts. Notably amongst the berries consumed, the cranberry, is possibly named after the species.

Animal foods become more important during the summer breeding season and may be the primary food source at that time of year, especially while regurgitating to young. Their animal foods are insects, especially dragonflies, and also snails, earthworms, crabs, spiders, millipedes, woodlice, amphibians, rodents, and small birds.

Common cranes may either forage on land or in shallow water, probing around with their bills for any edible organism. Although crops may locally be damaged by the species, they mostly consume waste grain in winter from previously harvested fields and so actually benefit farmers by cleaning fields for use in the following year. As with other cranes, all foraging (as well as drinking and roosting) is done in small groups, which may variously consist of pairs, family groups or winter flocks.

===Breeding===

This species usually lays eggs in May, though seldom will do so earlier or later. Like most cranes, this species displays indefinite monogamous pair bonds. If one mate dies, a crane may attempt to court a new mate the following year. Although a pair may be together for many years, the courtship rituals of the species are enacted by every pair each spring. The dancing of common cranes has complex, social meanings and may occur at almost any time of year. Dancing may include bobs, bows, pirouettes, and stops, as in various crane species. Aggressive displays may include ruffled wing feathers, throwing vegetation in the air and pointing the bare red patch on their heads at each other. Courtship displays begin with a male following the female in a stately, march-like walk. The unison call, consists of the female holding her head up and gradually lowering down as she calls out. The female calls out a high note and then the male follows with a longer scream in a similar posture. Copulation consists of a similar, dramatic display.

The nesting territory of common cranes is variable and is based on the local habitat. It can range in size from variously . In common with sandhill cranes (and no other crane species), common cranes &quot;paint&quot; their bodies with mud or decaying vegetation, apparently in order to blend into their nesting environment. The nest is either in or very near shallow water, often with dense shore vegetation nearby, and may be used over several years. The size and placement of the nest varies considerably over the range, with Arctic birds building relatively small nests. In Sweden, an average nest is around across.

The clutch of the common crane usually contains two eggs, with seldom one laid and, even more rarely, 3 or 4. If a clutch is lost early in incubation, the cranes may be able to lay another one within a couple of weeks. The incubation period is around 30 days and is done primarily by the female but occasionally by both sexes. If humans approach the nest both parents may engage in a distraction display but known ground predators (including domestic dogs (&quot;Canis lupus familiaris&quot;)) are physically attacked almost immediately.

New hatchlings are generally quite helpless but are able to crawl away from danger within a few hours, can swim soon after hatching and can run with their parents at 24 hours old. Chicks respond to danger by freezing, using their camouflaged brownish down to defend them beyond their fierce parents. Young chicks use their wings to stabilise them while running, while by 9 weeks of age they can fly short distances. The adult birds go through their postbreeding moult while caring for their young, rendering them flightless for about 5 to 6 weeks around the time the young also can&#x27;t fly yet. According to figures of cranes wintering in Spain, around 48% birds have surviving young by the time they winter and around 18% are leading two young by winter. By the next breeding season, the previous years young often flock together. The age of sexual maturity in wild birds has been estimated at variously from 3 to 6 years of age.

===Longevity===
This species could live up to 30 or 40 years of age. But the data on longevity (43 years) and life expectancy (12 years, N=7 cranes) were published with captive cranes. Common cranes living in the wild must show shorter lives. Successful breeders, the best subjects in the population, are guessed to live on average 12 years. Unsuccessful breeding cranes, therefore, may have shorter lives. Elementary survival analysis with the Euring database reports a life expectancy at birth (LEB) of c. 5 years. This LEB of 5 years was similar to that estimated for other crane species, as for example the Florida sandhill cranes (&quot;G. canadensis&quot;) (LEB = 7 years). Reports of tagged common cranes have increased rapidly in the last decades. Therefore, longevity and life expectancy at birth of wild common cranes will be updated.

===Sociality===
The common crane is a fairly social bird while not breeding. Flocks of up to 400 birds may be seen flying together during migration. Staging sites, where migrating birds gather to rest and feed in the middle of their migration, may witness thousands of cranes gathering at once. However, the flocks of the species are not stable social units but rather groups that ensure greater safety in numbers and collectively draw each other&#x27;s attention to ideal foraging and roosting sites. Possibly due to a longer molt, younger and non-breeding cranes are usually the earliest fall migrants and may band together at that time of year. During these migratory flights, common cranes have been known to fly at altitudes of up to , one of the highest of any species of bird, second only to the Ruppell&#x27;s Griffin Vulture.

Cranes use a kleptoparasitic strategy to recover from temporary reductions in feeding rate, particularly when the rate is below the threshold of intake necessary for survival. Accumulated intake of common cranes during daytime at a site of stopover and wintering shows a typical anti-sigmoid shape, with greatest increases of intake after dawn and before dusk.

===Interspecies interactions===
There are few natural predators of adult cranes, although white-tailed eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;), Bonelli&#x27;s eagles (&quot;Aquila fasciata&quot;), eastern imperial eagles (&quot;Aquila heliaca&quot;) and golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) are a potential predatory threat to common cranes of all ages. The crane has been known to counterattack eagles both on the land and in mid-flight, using their bill as a weapon and kicking with their feet. Mammals such as wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), wolverine (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;) and red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) are attacked at the nest, Herbivorous mammals such as red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;) may also be attacked at the nest, indicating the high aggressiveness of the birds while nesting. The determined attack of a parent crane often assures safety from predators including large mammals such as foxes, but occasional losses to predation are inevitable. The carrion crow (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) is locally a successful predator of common cranes&#x27; eggs, trickily using distraction displays to steal them. Other species of &quot;Corvus&quot; may also cause some loss of eggs, with common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) also taking some small chicks. Common cranes may loosely associate with any other crane in the genus &quot;Grus&quot; in migration or winter as well as greater white-fronted geese and bean geese.

==Population and conservation==
In 2015, the global population was estimated to be about 500,000 individuals. The vast majority of pairs nest in Russia, Finland (30–40,000 pairs in 2009) and Sweden ( 30,000 pairs in 2012). On the fringes of its range, it has often become rare or even been extirpated, but in several European countries this trend has been reversed and overall the European population is increasing.

In the early 20th century, it was considered rare in Poland, but gradually began to increase and this has accelerated since the 1980s. In 2010–2012, the Polish population was estimated to number 20–22,000 pairs. Norway had 3–5,000 pairs in 2015 and Estonia had 5,800 pairs in 1999, with both increasing. The German breeding population increased from 700 pairs in 1978 to more than 10,000 pairs in 2017, which is still a fraction of the size of the numbers that once bred in the country. After having disappeared as a breeding bird decades earlier, the species began breeding again in France in 2000 and in 2017 there were more than 20 pairs. In Denmark, the common crane returned as a breeder in 1953, about a century after it had disappeared. Numbers remained extremely low, less than 5 pairs, until the 1990s when a rapid increase began; in 2022 there were at least 750 pairs in Denmark. In the Netherlands, the species disappeared as a breeding bird centuries ago, but it returned in 2001 and by 2020 there were about 40 pairs in the country. The common crane returned to the Czech Republic as a breeder in 1981 and by 2004 it had increased to 35 pairs. In 2009, the species again began to breed in Slovakia, and in Austria it returned as a breeding bird in 2018 after having disappeared in 1885. Although large numbers winter in Spain, the last breeding in the country had been in 1954. In 2017, a pair that had been released after being rehabilitated bred in Spain. It was extirpated as a breeder from Italy around 1920 and Hungary by 1952, and it also used to breed in the Balkans; significant numbers still pass through these countries during migration.

In the United Kingdom, the common crane became extirpated in the 17th century, but a small and increasing population now breeds again in the Norfolk Broads and a reintroduction began in 2010 in the Somerset levels. A total of 93 birds were released between 2010 and 2014 as part of the reintroduction effort, and there are now 180 resident birds in the UK. In 2016, a wild crane was born in Wales for the first time in over 400 years. In 2021, the British population had increased to 72 pairs. In the Republic of Ireland, several visiting flocks were observed in the 2000s and in 2021 a pair managed to breed for the first time on the island in 300 years.

The main threat to the species and the primary reason for its decline comes from habitat loss and degradation, as a result of dam construction, urbanisation, agricultural expansion, and drainage of wetlands. Although it has adapted to human settlement in many areas, nest disturbance, continuing changes in land use, and collision with utility lines are still potential problems. Further threats may include persecution due to crop damage, pesticide poisoning, egg collection, and hunting. The common crane is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Culture==
In 1870 Józef Chełmoński painted a picture: &quot;Departure of Cranes&quot; (National Museum in Cracow)

In Ireland, despite being extinct for over 200 years, the common crane plays a very important part in Irish culture and folklore and so thus recent efforts to encourage it back to Ireland are received with much enthusiasm.

The Kranich Museum in Hessenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, is dedicated to art and folklore related to the common crane.

The common crane is the sacred bird of the god Hephaestus, and it features heavily in the god&#x27;s iconography.
In Indian states of Rajsthan and Gujarat this crane is described in lots of folk songs. For example: a newly married woman (whose husband has gone to a far away place for earning) will sing a song to crane to take a message to her husband and request to tell him to come home early.

<text>The Aga saga is a subgenre of the family saga genre of literature. The genre is named for the AGA cooker, a type of stored-heat oven that came to be popular in medium to large country houses in the UK after its introduction in 1929. It refers primarily to fictional family sagas dealing with British &quot;middle-class country or village life&quot;. The nickname &quot;Aga saga&quot; is sometimes used condescendingly about this type of fiction. The term was incorporated into the &quot;Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; in 2000.

==Characteristics==
While the label has been applied to settings within other genres, it is typically interpreted to refer to &quot;a tale of illicit rumpy-pumpy in the countryside&quot; according to a 2007 article in &quot;The Observer&quot;. In setting, according to an earlier article in that paper, it offers a &quot;gingham-checked world&quot; associated with &quot;thatched English villages&quot; and &quot;ladies in floral dresses&quot;. &quot;Guardian&quot; book critic Laura Wilson described an Aga saga setting as &quot;complete with sprawling, untidy farmhouse (flagstones, dogs, Wellington boots, and much nursing of mugs of coffee)&quot;.

==Critical analyses==
&quot;The Times&quot;, in a 2004 article, characterized the genre as the &quot;older sister of the sex &#x27;n&#x27; shopping romances&quot;. According to a critical analysis in &quot;The Independent&quot;, the genre rose to prominence in the 1990s not as a continuance of the celebration of &quot;sex and shopping [that] reflected the materialism of the 1980s&quot;, but as a signal of &quot;disillusionment with those values&quot;. &quot;Guardian&quot; Arts and Heritage correspondent Maev Kennedy described the genre poetically as encapsulating &quot;the nostalgic yearning for an Arcadian idyll&quot;.

==Origin==
The term was coined in 1992 by novelist Terence Blacker to describe specifically the work of Joanna Trollope, which not only inspired the label but popularized the type of literature typically so labeled. Trollope indicated in 2003 that &quot;[t]he name itself indicates a provincial cosiness, and is patronising of the readers. A lot of what I write into the books is bleak and challenging but I will be the Queen of the Aga saga to my dying day. It&#x27;s jolly annoying, but it is better than being the Queen of Hearts&quot;. 

In 2003 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Blacker had expressed both his respect for the author and his remorse for contributing the label, indicating that it was applied &quot;early in her career and these tags are rather distorting and unfair&quot;, but Blacker later indicated in &quot;The Independent&quot; that &quot;[a]lthough it must be bloody annoying for a writer to have her work reduced to a flip phrase, I have only used it once and in a perfectly respectable context. What happened to the term after that is no more my responsibility than it would be Trollope&#x27;s if her jokey reference to a certain kind of serious fiction as &#x27;grim lit&#x27; took hold&quot;. In 2005, Trollope indicated that she was &quot;fairly tired of such an inaccurate and patronising tag&quot;. In the &quot;Aga Saga&quot; entry, &quot;Oxford Companion to English Literature&quot; exemplifies the genre by the work of Trollope, but notes that &quot;by no means all her work fits the generally comforting implications of the label&quot;.

<text>In cooking, a leavening agent () or raising agent, also called a leaven () or leavener, is any one of a number of substances used in doughs and batters that cause a foaming action (gas bubbles) that lightens and softens the mixture. An alternative or supplement to leavening agents is mechanical action by which air is incorporated (i.e. kneading). Leavening agents can be biological or synthetic chemical compounds. The gas produced is often carbon dioxide, or occasionally hydrogen.

When a dough or batter is mixed, the starch in the flour and the water in the dough form a matrix (often supported further by proteins like gluten or polysaccharides, such as pentosans or xanthan gum). The starch then gelatinizes and sets, leaving gas bubbles that remain.

== Biological leavening agents ==
* &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; producing carbon dioxide found in:
** baker&#x27;s yeast
** Beer barm (unpasteurised—live yeast)
** ginger beer
** kefir
** sourdough starter
* &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; producing hydrogen found in salt-rising bread

== Chemical leavening agents ==
Chemical leavens are mixtures or compounds that release gases when they react with each other, with moisture, or with heat. Most are based on a combination of acid (usually a low molecular weight organic acid) and a salt of bicarbonate . After they act, these compounds leave behind a chemical salt. Chemical leavens are used in quick breads and cakes, as well as cookies and numerous other applications where a long biological fermentation is impractical or undesirable.

===History===
Chemical leavening using pearl ash as a leavening agent was mentioned by Amelia Simmons in her &quot;American Cookery&quot;, published in 1796.

Since chemical expertise is required to create a functional chemical leaven without producing off-flavors from the chemical precursors involved, such substances are often mixed into premeasured combinations for maximum results. These are generally referred to as baking powders. Sour milk and carbonates were used in the 1800s. The breakthrough in chemical leavening agents occurred in the 1930s with the introduction of monocalcium phosphates . Other leavening agents developed include sodium aluminium sulfate , disodium pyrophosphate , and sodium aluminium phosphates . These compounds combine with sodium bicarbonate to give carbon dioxide in a predictable manner.

== Other leavens ==
Steam and air are used as leavening agents when they expand upon heating. To take advantage of this style of leavening, the baking must be done at high enough temperatures to flash the water to steam, with a batter that is capable of holding the steam in until set. This effect is typically used in products having one large cavity, such as popovers, Yorkshire puddings, pita, and most preparations made from choux pastry. The effect is also seen to a lesser extent in tempura.

== Mechanical leavening ==

Using a whisk on certain liquids, notably cream or egg whites, can also create foams through mechanical action. This is the method employed in the making of sponge cakes, where an egg protein matrix produced by vigorous whipping provides almost all the structure of the finished product.

The Chorleywood bread process uses a mix of biological and mechanical leavening to produce bread; while it is considered by food processors to be an effective way to deal with the soft wheat flours characteristic of British Isles agriculture, it is controversial due to a perceived lack of quality in the final product. The process has nevertheless been adapted by industrial bakers in other parts of the world.

<doc id="198061" wikidata="Q3281484" url="?curid=198061" title="Chicago (1927 film)">
<text>Chicago is a 1927 American silent crime comedy-drama film produced by Cecil B. DeMille and directed by Frank Urson. The first film adaptation of Maurine Dallas Watkins&#x27; play of the same name, the film stars Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart, a fame-obsessed housewife who kills her lover in cold blood and, after trying to coerce her husband into taking the blame, is put on trial for murder.

==Plot==
The plot of the film is drawn from the 1926 play &quot;Chicago&quot; by Maurine Dallas Watkins which was in turn based on the true story of Beulah Annan, fictionalized as Roxie Hart (Phyllis Haver), and her spectacular murder of her boyfriend.

The silent film adds considerably to the material in Watkins&#x27; play, some additions based on the original murder, and some for Hollywood considerations. The murder, which occurs in a very brief vignette before the play begins, is fleshed out considerably. Also, Roxie&#x27;s husband Amos Hart has a much more sympathetic and active role in the film than he does either in the play or in the subsequent musical. The original ending is altered to have Roxie punished for her crime.

==Cast==
* Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart
* Victor Varconi as Amos Hart
* Virginia Bradford as Katie
* Robert Edeson as William Flynn
* Eugene Pallette as Rodney Casley
* Warner Richmond as Asst. District Attorney
* T. Roy Barnes as Reporter
* Clarence Burton as Police sergeant
* Julia Faye as Velma
* May Robson as Matron Mrs. Morton
* Viola Louie as Two Gun Rosie

==Preservation and availability==
Complete prints of &quot;Chicago&quot; are held by:

* Archives du Film du CNC
* Cinematheque Royale de Belgique
* Filmoteka Narodowa in Warsaw
* Museum Of Modern Art (on 35 mm and 16 mm)
* Gosfilmofond
* Arhiva Națională de Filme
* George Eastman Museum 
* UCLA Film and Television Archive (on 35 mm)
* Cinémathèque française

The film was long difficult to see, but in 2006 the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored a 35 mm print, which was screened at Kansas Silent Film Festival in 2007. Flicker Alley released the film on DVD in 2010 and later on Blu-ray on October 6, 2020.

==Adaptations==
The plot was adapted into a stage musical in 1975 with music and lyrics by John Kander and Fred Ebb and received mixed reviews. A 1996 City Center Encores! production received critical acclaim and later transferred to Broadway, ultimately becoming the longest-running musical revival on Broadway. The stage musical was made into a musical film in 2002, starring Renée Zellweger as Roxie, Catherine Zeta-Jones as fellow murderess Velma Kelly, Richard Gere as Billy Flynn, Queen Latifah as Mama Morton, and John C. Reilly as Amos. The film was also a hit and won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2003.

<text>Deshabandu Warnakulasuriya Patabendige Ushantha Joseph Chaminda Vaas (born 27 January 1974) is a former Sri Lankan international cricketer who represented the Sri Lanka national cricket team. He is a fast medium pace bowler and regarded as one of the greatest bowlers from Sri Lanka and one of the most successful bowlers in international cricket. He was a part of the Sri Lankan squad which won the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

In 2004 Vaas gained international recognition when he was selected for the World Test and one-day XI at the inaugural ICC Awards. He was again selected for the World Test XI in 2005. In his fifteen-year international career, he was relatively free of injury.

He has set a number of national and international records as a bowler. Vaas currently holds the record for the best bowling figures in ODI history, and is the only bowler to take an 8-wicket haul in ODIs. As of 11 February 2022, only 3 bowlers have taken more ODI wickets than Vaas. He is the youngest bowler to take 300 wickets in ODI cricket. Vaas was also the first Sri Lankan to take a hat-trick in the ODI format of the game which he did in 2001 against Zimbabwe, and at a Cricket World Cup, which he did against Bangladesh in the 2003 tournament. His World Cup hat-trick was also the first one taken during the first three deliveries of an innings. Vaas has one of the longest names among international cricketers.

==Domestic career==

Vaas joined Colts Cricket Club after leaving school and made his first-class debut against Galle Cricket Club in December 1990 aged 16. He joined Middlesex County Cricket Club for the 2007 cricket season as an overseas player. At the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008 he was picked by Deccan Chargers on a contract worth $200,000. He played 4 matches for the Deccan Chargers team and picked 4 wickets at an average of 26.61. In 2009 he played some matches in P.Sen trophy for Mohun Bagan. He also joined Northamptonshire County Cricket Club for the 2010 T20 competition and found himself in the unusual position of opening the batting although he did well recording three half centuries. He subsequently signed a contract to join Northants for the entire 2011 and 2012 seasons. At the end of 2011 he was named their &#x27;Player of the season&#x27; following a great all-round performance, having topped the bowling averages by taking 70 first-class wickets at an average of 21.44 apiece and also scoring 403 runs at an average of 26.9. Vaas was released by Northants at the end of the 2012 season due to persistent injury problems throughout the year.

==International career==
===Early years===
Nearly 4 years after his first-class debut, after just 13 matches, Vaas made his Test debut for the Sri Lankan cricket team against Pakistan at Kandy in August 1994. Within his first year in the national side, he made a great impact guiding Sri Lanka to their maiden Test Match away victory against New Zealand at Napier, taking 5–47 &amp; 5–43 and scoring 33 &amp; 36 and being nominated Man of the Match. In the second test at Dunedin, only his sixth Test, he took his third five-wicket haul and was again named Man of the Match.

He was a regular member of the ODI side during the 1996 World Cup, playing in all six matches including the Final, where Sri Lanka defeated Australia to become world champions for the first time.

===Record breaking===
In 2001–02, he took 26 wickets in a series win against the West Indies at home. This included one match-haul of 14 wickets in the third test, a feat only achieved by two fast bowlers in the subcontinent, the other being Imran Khan. At the 2003 Cricket World Cup, held in South Africa, Vaas picked up 23 wickets, becoming the leading wicket taker in the tournament. This included a best of 6–25 against Bangladesh, where Vaas also took a hat-trick with the first three deliveries of the Bangladesh innings. It is the first time in Test or one-day history that a bowler has taken a hat-trick with the first three balls of a game.

In August 2004, he took six wickets in the second innings at the SSC to deliver Sri Lanka their first-ever series win over South Africa by handing out a comprehensive thrashing. Along with rookie fast bowler Lasith Malinga, a canny Vaas exploited conditions far better than the visitors and in the fourth innings the pair terrorised South Africa&#x27;s batsmen.

In July 2005, Vaas completed another excellent contest against West Indies, taking 13 wickets in a 2-0 drubbing to become Man of the Series.

In December 2005, he reached the 300-wicket milestone in Tests against India.

For his performances in 2004 and 2005, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC. He was also named in the ICC ODI Team of the Year in 2004 and 2007.

===Captaincy===
He had the rare opportunity to captain Sri Lankan ODI team in 2006, which was restricted to only one match.

===Through ranks===
One of Vaas&#x27; more memorable contributions as a tailender was during the 2006 Test series in England, when he and Nuwan Kulasekara&#x27;s steady defence of the ninth wicket, in spite of on-and-off interruptions by rainy weather, held the home side to a draw in the first test. Vaas scored a half century not out in the second innings. Although losing the second test, Sri Lanka won the third test and went on to whitewash England in the subsequent ODI series.

On 26 June 2007 at Colombo, he made his maiden test century against Bangladesh when he scored 100 not out in a total of 577–6 declared. This occurred in his 97th Test Match, which at the time was a record for the most number of Tests before scoring a maiden century (since overtaken by Anil Kumble). Soon after in November 2007, Vaas played his 100th Test match against England, in what was also Sanath Jayasuriya&#x27;s final Test match for Sri Lanka. During the historic 2007–08 tour of the West Indies, Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever Test win on Caribbean soil, he took twelve wickets overall and was also named Man of the Match of the first test. He notably dismissed all-rounder Chris Gayle for a record seventh time in as many tests, bowling him out for a duck during the first test.

===Late career===
On 27 August 2008, Vaas bowled Yuvraj Singh for a duck in his final ODI match, the fourth match of the ODI series against India, to achieve his milestone 400th ODI wicket. He joined Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and his teammate Muttiah Muralitharan as only the fourth bowler in international cricket to have taken 400 ODI wickets.

He retired from Test Cricket after the 3rd Test against Pakistan in July 2009.

==Playing style==
Vaas was a left arm swing bowler known for his accuracy and consistent line and length, which his former captain Aravinda de Silva once described as &quot;accurate, nagging, hard to get away&quot;. Early in his career he stood out for his raw pace. Due to his accuracy with the new ball he would be tasked with opening the bowling, as illustrated by the number of times he dismissed important higher and middle order batsmen such as Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Stephen Fleming. He became noted for his inswinger and well-disguised off cutter and, as his pace dropped over the years, later added reverse swing to his armoury. His consistent deliveries and ability to use various types of swing deliveries effectively made him a consistent wicket-taker even in humid weather and on dry and dusty subcontinental pitches, conditions which are known to favour spin bowlers rather than fast bowlers.

Vaas is also a useful lower order batsman, and has reached 3,000 Test runs, including 13 Test half-centuries and a century. Only 11 bowlers in Test history with 200 wickets have scored more runs than Vaas.

==World records==
Chaminda Vaas is Sri Lanka&#x27;s most successful pace bowler, having taken 355 Test wickets from 111 tests. He led the Sri Lankan new ball attack for over a decade. He achieved his 300th test wicket on 12 December 2005 against India, becoming one of the three Sri Lankan bowlers to pass this milestone, along with Muttiah Muralitharan and Rangana Herath. Vaas has also taken 400 One Day International wickets, only the second Sri Lankan to do so, also after Muralitharan. Only three bowlers have taken more wickets in ODI cricket history. His partnership with Muralitharan is statistically one of international cricket&#x27;s most productive bowling duos across all formats. Vaas has completed the All-rounder&#x27;s treble of 3000 runs and 300 wickets in Tests.

Vaas holds the record for the best bowling performance in one-day international cricket with his 8 for 19 off eight overs against Zimbabwe at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in December 2001. Vaas took the first eight wickets of Zimbabwe&#x27;s then record-lowest ODI innings of 38, with Muralitharan taking the final two wickets in his first over. It remains the only eight-wicket haul in ODI cricket history. Vaas holds the record for the quickest five wicket haul in ODIs, when he took the fifer against Bangladesh within 16 balls.

Vaas has taken two ODI hat-tricks in his career, the third of only four players to have achieved the feat. The first was taken as part of his 8/19 spell in 2001. Vaas is also one of only two bowlers to take two five-wicket hauls at McLean Park.

==Coaching career==
In October 2012, he was contracted to coach the New Zealand fast bowlers during their tour of Sri Lanka, which included two Test matches. In May 2013, he was appointed as bowling coach for the Sri Lankan side participating in the Champions Trophy competition in England. He served as Sri Lanka&#x27;s bowling coach until April 2015.
In January 2016, Vaas was named as Ireland cricket team bowling coach. His short-term assignment included two T20Is against United Arab Emirates cricket team in UAE and 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India. After serving out his contract he was re-hired in August 2016 to serve as Sri Lanka&#x27;s fast bowling consultant.

On 21 July 2017, Vaas replaced Champaka Ramanayake as Sri Lanka&#x27;s bowling coach. Sri Lanka Cricket announced that Vaas will mentor the team during India&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka in 2017.

On 19 February 2021, Vaas replaced David Saker as Sri Lanka&#x27;s fast bowling coach. However, Vaas resigned on 21 February on the eve of Sri Lanka&#x27;s departure for their tour of West Indies citing salary issues.

==Personal life==
Vaas is Roman Catholic and was known to pray before every game. He intended to become a priest at a young age but believed that God wanted him to play cricket instead. &quot;I seriously considered going into the priesthood, which would have meant 12 to 14 years of study. But then cricket began to take over. I think that God created me as a cricketer, so I am happy that that&#x27;s my calling.&quot; He suffered some minor injuries during the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team bus by gunmen in Lahore which resulted in the abandonment of that Test series against Pakistan.

He is married to Wasana whom he married in 1999 and the couple has three children, a daughter and two sons.

According to Bill Frindall, scorer and statistician for BBC Radio&#x27;s Test Match Special, Chaminda is actually his penultimate given name, therefore his initials should read WPUJC. Vaas&#x27; full name is often cited in lists of longest names in the cricket world.

Vaas was awarded the 3rd highest award in 1996 by the Sri Lankan government when he received the Deshabandu for his contribution to winning the world cup.

A native of Mattumagala, a village near Wattala on the outskirts of Colombo, Vaas attended St. Anthony&#x27;s College, Wattala for primary school and is an alumnus of St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Colombo, which is well known as the &quot;alma mater&quot; of many cricketers and politicians. The &quot;Murali-Vaas Trophy&quot;, awarded to the winner of the annual cricket match between St. Joseph&#x27;s and historic rivals St. Anthony&#x27;s College, Kandy, was named after him and St. Anthony&#x27;s alumnus Muttiah Muralitharan.

In 2015, Vaas and former Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu were awarded Honorary Life Membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

<doc id="198064" wikidata="Q1420011" url="?curid=198064" title="Tuskegee Syphilis Study">
<text>The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male (informally referred to as the Tuskegee Experiment or Tuskegee Syphilis Study) was a study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a group of nearly 400 African American men with syphilis. The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated, though by the end of the study medical advancements meant it was entirely treatable. The men were not informed of the nature of the experiment, and more than 100 died as a result.

The Public Health Service started the study in 1932 in collaboration with Tuskegee University (then the Tuskegee Institute), a historically Black college in Alabama. In the study, investigators enrolled 600 impoverished African-American sharecroppers from Macon County, Alabama. Of these men, 399 had latent syphilis, with a control group of 201 men who were not infected. As an incentive for participation in the study, the men were promised free medical care. While the men were provided with both medical and mental care that they otherwise would not have received, they were deceived by the PHS, who never informed them of their syphilis diagnosis and provided disguised placebos, ineffective methods, and diagnostic procedures as treatment for &quot;bad blood&quot;.

The men were initially told that the experiment was only going to last six months, but it was extended to 40 years. After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the infected men were treated with penicillin despite the fact that, by 1947, the antibiotic was widely available and had become the standard treatment for syphilis.

The study continued, under numerous Public Health Service supervisors, until 1972, when a leak to the press resulted in its termination on November 16 of that year. By then, 28 patients had died directly from syphilis, 100 died from complications related to syphilis, 40 of the patients&#x27; wives were infected with syphilis, and 19 children were born with congenital syphilis.

The 40-year Tuskegee Study was a major violation of ethical standards and has been cited as &quot;arguably the most infamous biomedical research study in U.S. history.&quot; Its revelation led to the 1979 Belmont Report and to the establishment of the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and federal laws and regulations requiring institutional review boards for the protection of human subjects in studies. The OHRP manages this responsibility within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Its revelation has also been an important cause of distrust in medical science and the US government amongst African Americans.

In 1997, President Bill Clinton formally apologized on behalf of the United States to victims of the study, calling it shameful and racist. &quot;What was done cannot be undone, but we can end the silence,&quot; he said. &quot;We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye, and finally say, on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful and I am sorry.&quot;

==History==

===Study details===
In 1928, the &quot;Oslo Study of Untreated Syphilis&quot; had reported on the pathologic manifestations of untreated syphilis in several hundred white males. This study was a retrospective study since investigators pieced together information from the histories of patients who had already contracted syphilis but remained untreated for some time.

The U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee group decided to build on the Oslo work and perform a prospective study to complement it. The U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee began as a 6-month descriptive epidemiological study of the range of pathology associated with syphilis in the population of Macon County. The researchers involved with the study reasoned that they were not harming the men involved in the study, under the presumption that they were unlikely to ever receive treatment. At that time, it was believed that the effects of syphilis depended on the race of those affected. Physicians believed that syphilis had a more pronounced effect on African-Americans&#x27; cardiovascular systems than on their central nervous systems.

Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished, African-American sharecroppers. Of these men, 399 had latent syphilis, with a control group of 201 men who were not infected. As an incentive for participation in the study, the men were promised free medical care, but were deceived by the PHS, who never informed subjects of their diagnosis, despite the risk of infecting others, and the fact that the disease could lead to blindness, deafness, mental illness, heart disease, bone deterioration, the collapse of the central nervous system, and death. Instead, the men were told that they were being treated for &quot;bad blood&quot;, a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. The collection of illnesses the term included was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.

At the study&#x27;s commencement, major medical textbooks had recommended that all syphilis be treated, as the consequences were quite severe. At that time, treatment included arsenic-based compounds such as arsphenamine (branded as the &quot;606&quot; formula). Initially, subjects were studied for six to eight months and then treated with contemporary methods, including Salvarsan (&quot;606&quot;), mercurial ointments, and bismuth, which were mildly effective and highly toxic. Additionally, men in the study were administered disguised placebos, ineffective methods, and diagnostic procedures, which were misrepresented as treatments.

Throughout, participants remained ignorant of the study clinicians&#x27; true purpose, which was to observe the natural course of untreated syphilis. Study clinicians could have chosen to treat all syphilitic subjects and close the study, or split off a control group for testing with penicillin. Instead, they continued the study without treating any participants; they withheld treatment and information about penicillin from the subjects. In addition, scientists prevented participants from accessing syphilis treatment programs available to other residents in the area. The researchers reasoned that the knowledge gained would benefit humankind; however, it was determined afterward that the doctors did harm their subjects by depriving them of appropriate treatment once it had been discovered. The study was characterized as &quot;the longest non-therapeutic experiment on human beings in medical history.&quot;

To ensure that the men would show up for the possibly dangerous, painful, diagnostic, and non-therapeutic spinal taps, doctors sent participants a misleading letter titled &quot;Last Chance for Special Free Treatment&quot;.

The U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee published its first clinical data in 1934 and issued its first major report in 1936. This was before the discovery of penicillin as a safe and effective treatment for syphilis. The study was not secret, since reports and data sets were published to the medical community throughout its duration.

During World War II, 256 of the infected subjects registered for the draft and were consequently diagnosed as having syphilis at military induction centers and ordered to obtain treatment for syphilis before they could be taken into the armed services. PHS researchers prevented these men from getting treatment, thus depriving them of chances for a cure. Vonderlehr argued, &quot;this study is of great importance from a scientific standpoint. It represents one of the last opportunities which the science of medicine will have to conduct an investigation of this kind. ... [Study] Doctor [Murray] Smith ... asked that these men be excluded from the list of draftees needing treatment. ... in order to make it possible to continue this study on an effective basis.&quot;

Later, Smith, a local PHS representative involved in the study, wrote to Vonderlehr to ask what should be done with patients who had tested negative for syphilis at the time of enrollment in the study and were being used as control subjects but had later tested positive when registering for the draft: &quot;So far, we are keeping the known positive patients from getting treatment. Is a control case of any value to the study, if he has contracted syphilis? Shall we withhold treatment from the control case who has developed syphilis?&quot; Vonderlehr replied that such cases &quot;have lost their value to the study. There is no reason why these patients should not be given appropriate treatment unless you hear from Doctor Austin V. Deibert who is in direct charge of the study&quot;.

By 1947, penicillin had become standard therapy for syphilis. The U.S. government sponsored several public health programs to form &quot;rapid treatment centers&quot; to eradicate the disease. When campaigns to eradicate venereal disease came to Macon County, study researchers prevented their subjects from participating. Although some of the men in the study received arsenical or penicillin treatments elsewhere, for most of them this did not amount to &quot;adequate therapy&quot;. By the end of the study in 1972, only 74 of the test subjects were still alive. Of the original 399 men, 28 had died of syphilis, 100 died of related complications, 40 of their wives had been infected, and 19 of their children were born with congenital syphilis.

The revelation in 1972 of study failures by whistleblower Peter Buxtun led to major changes in U.S. law and regulation concerning the protection of participants in clinical studies. Studies now require informed consent, communication of diagnosis and accurate reporting of test results.

===Study clinicians===
The venereal disease section of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) formed a study group in 1932 at its national headquarters in Washington, D.C. Taliaferro Clark, head of the USPHS, is credited with founding it. His initial goal was to follow untreated syphilis in a group of African-American men for six months to one year, and then follow up with a treatment phase. When the Rosenwald Fund withdrew its financial support, a treatment program was deemed too expensive. Clark, however, decided to continue the study, interested in determining whether syphilis had a different effect on African-Americans than it did on Caucasians. A regressive study of untreated syphilis in white males had been conducted in Oslo, Norway, and could provide the basis for comparison. The prevailing belief at the time was white people were more likely to develop neurosyphilis and that black people were more likely to sustain cardiovascular damage. Clark resigned before the study was extended beyond its original length.

Although Clark is usually assigned blame for conceiving the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee, Thomas Parran Jr. also helped develop a non-treatment study in Macon County, Alabama. As the Health Commissioner of New York State (and former head of the PHS Venereal Disease Division), Parran was asked by the Rosenwald Fund to assess their serological survey of syphilis and demonstration projects in five Southern states. Among his conclusions was the recommendation that: &quot;If one wished to study the natural history of syphilis in the African American race uninfluenced by treatment, this county (Macon) would be an ideal location for such a study.&quot;

Oliver C. Wenger was the director of the regional PHS Venereal Disease Clinic in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He and his staff took the lead in developing study procedures. Wenger continued to advise and assist the study when it was adapted as a long-term, no-treatment observational study after funding for treatment was lost.

Raymond A. Vonderlehr was appointed on-site director of the research program and developed the policies that shaped the long-term follow-up section of the project. His method of gaining the &quot;consent&quot; of the subjects for spinal taps (to look for signs of neurosyphilis) was by advertising this diagnostic test as a &quot;special free treatment&quot;. He also met with local black doctors and asked them to deny treatment to participants in the Tuskegee Study. Vonderlehr retired as head of the venereal disease section in 1943, shortly after penicillin was proven to cure syphilis.

Several African-American health workers and educators associated with the Tuskegee Institute played a critical role in the study&#x27;s progress. The extent to which they knew about the full scope of the study is not clear in all cases. Robert Russa Moton, then president of Tuskegee Institute, and Eugene Dibble, head of the Institute&#x27;s John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, both lent their endorsement and institutional resources to the government study.

Nurse Eunice Rivers, who had trained at Tuskegee Institute and worked at its hospital, was recruited at the start of the study to be the main point of contact with the participants. Rivers played a crucial role in the study because she served as the direct link to the regional African-American community. Vonderlehr considered her participation to be the key to gaining the trust of the subjects and promoting their participation. As a part of &quot;Miss Rivers&#x27; Lodge&quot;, participants would receive free physical examinations at Tuskegee University, free rides to and from the clinic, hot meals on examination days, and free treatment for minor ailments. Rivers was also key in convincing families to sign autopsy agreements in return for funeral benefits. As the study became long-term, Rivers became the chief person who provided continuity to the participants. She was the only study staff person to work with participants for the full 40 years.


==Study termination==

Several men employed by the PHS, namely Austin V. Deibert and Albert P. Iskrant, expressed criticism of the study, primarily on the grounds of poor scientific practice. The first dissenter against the study who was not involved in the PHS was Count Gibson, an associate professor at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. He expressed his ethical concerns to PHS&#x27;s Sidney Olansky in 1955.

Another dissenter was Irwin Schatz, a young Chicago doctor only four years out of medical school. In 1965, Schatz read an article about the study in a medical journal and wrote a letter directly to the study&#x27;s authors confronting them with a declaration of brazen unethical practice. His letter, read by Anne R. Yobs, one of the study&#x27;s authors, was immediately ignored and filed away with a brief memo that no reply would be sent.

In 1966, Peter Buxtun, a PHS venereal-disease investigator in San Francisco, sent a letter to the national director of the Division of Venereal Diseases expressing his concerns about the ethics and morality of the extended U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee. The CDC, which by then controlled the study, reaffirmed the need to continue the study until completion; i.e. until all subjects had died and been autopsied. To bolster its position, the CDC received unequivocal support for the continuation of the study, both from local chapters of the National Medical Association (representing African-American physicians) and the American Medical Association (AMA).

In 1968, William Carter Jenkins, an African-American statistician in the PHS and part of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW), founded and edited &quot;The Drum&quot;, a newsletter devoted to ending racial discrimination in HEW. In &quot;The Drum&quot;, Jenkins called for an end to the study. He did not succeed; it is not clear who read his work.

Buxtun finally went to the press in the early 1970s. The story broke first in the &quot;Washington Star&quot; on July 25, 1972, reported by Jean Heller of the Associated Press. It became front-page news in the &quot;New York Times&quot; the following day. Senator Edward Kennedy called Congressional hearings, at which Buxtun and HEW officials testified. As a result of public outcry, the CDC and PHS appointed an ad hoc advisory panel to review the study. The panel found that the men agreed to certain terms of the experiment, such as examination and treatment. However, they were not informed of the study&#x27;s actual purpose. The panel then determined that the study was medically unjustified and ordered its termination.

In 1974, as part of the settlement of a class action lawsuit filed by the NAACP on behalf of study participants and their descendants, the U.S. government paid $10 million ($51.8 million in 2019) and agreed to provide free medical treatment to surviving participants and surviving family members infected as a consequence of the study. Congress created a commission empowered to write regulations to deter such abuses from occurring in the future.

A collection of materials compiled to investigate the study is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.
==Aftermath==

In 1974, Congress passed the National Research Act and created a commission to study and write regulations governing studies involving human participants. Within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) was established to oversee clinical trials. Now studies require informed consent, communication of diagnosis and accurate reporting of test results. Institutional review boards (IRBs), including laypeople, are established in scientific research groups and hospitals to review study protocols, protect patient interests, and ensure that participants are fully informed.

In 1994, a multi-disciplinary symposium was held on the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee: &quot;Doing Bad in the Name of Good?: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Its Legacy&quot; at the University of Virginia. Following that, interested parties formed the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee to develop ideas that had arisen at the symposium, chaired by Vanessa Northington Gamble. It issued its final report in May 1996, having been established at a meeting on January 18–19 of that year. The Committee had two related goals:
# President Bill Clinton should publicly apologize to the survivors and their community for past government wrongdoing related to the study due to the harm done to the Macon County community and Tuskegee University, and the fears of government and medical abuse the study created among African Americans. No apology had yet been issued at the time.
# The Committee and relevant federal agencies should develop a strategy to redress the damages, specifically recommending the creation of a center at Tuskegee University for public education about the study, &quot;training programs for health care providers&quot;, and a center for the study of ethics in scientific research.

A year later on May 16, 1997, Bill Clinton formally apologized and held a ceremony at the White House for surviving Tuskegee study participants. He said:

Five of the eight study survivors attended the White House ceremony.

The presidential apology led to progress in addressing the second goal of the Legacy Committee. The federal government contributed to establishing the National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care at Tuskegee, which officially opened in 1999 to explore issues that underlie research and medical care of African Americans and other under-served people.

In 2009, the Legacy Museum opened in the Bioethics Center, to honor the hundreds of participants of the &quot;Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the African American Male.&quot;

In June 2022, the Milbank Memorial Fund apologized to descendants of the study&#x27;s victims for its the role in the study.

=== Study participants ===

The five survivors who attended the White House ceremony in 1997 were Charlie Pollard, Herman Shaw, Carter Howard, Fred Simmons, and Frederick Moss. The remaining three survivors had family members attend the ceremony in their name. Sam Doner was represented by his daughter, Gwendolyn Cox; Ernest Hendon by his brother, North Hendon; and George Key by his grandson, Christopher Monroe. The last man who was a participant in the study died in 2004.

Charlie Pollard appealed to civil rights attorney Fred D. Gray, who also attended the White House ceremony, for help when he learned the true nature of the study he had been participating in for years. In 1973, &quot;Pollard v. United States&quot; resulted in a $10 million settlement.

Another participant of the study was Freddie Lee Tyson, a sharecropper who helped build Moton Field, where the legendary &quot;Tuskegee Airmen&quot; learned to fly during World War II.

==Legacy==
===Scientific failings===
Aside from a study of racial differences, one of the main goals that researchers in the study wanted to accomplish was to determine the extent to which treatment for syphilis was necessary and at what point in the progression of the disease it should be treated. For this reason, the study emphasized observation of individuals with late latent syphilis. However, despite clinicians&#x27; attempts to justify the study as necessary for science, the study itself was not conducted in a scientifically viable way. Because participants were treated with mercury rubs, injections of neoarsphenamine, protiodide, Salvarsan, and bismuth, the study did not follow subjects whose syphilis was untreated, however minimally effective these treatments may have been.

Austin V. Deibert of the PHS recognized that since the study&#x27;s main goal had been compromised in this way, the results would be meaningless and impossible to manipulate statistically. Even the toxic treatments that were available before the availability of penicillin, according to Deibert, could &quot;greatly lower, if not prevent, late syphilitic cardiovascular disease ... [while] increas[ing] the incidence of neuro-recurrence and other forms of relapse.&quot; Despite their effectiveness, these treatments were never prescribed to the participants.

===Racism===

The conception which lay behind the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee in 1932, in which 100% of its participants were poor, rural African-American men with very limited access to health information, reflects the racial attitudes in the U.S. at that time. The clinicians who led the study assumed that African-Americans were particularly susceptible to venereal diseases because of their race, and they assumed that the study&#x27;s participants were not interested in receiving medical treatment.

Taliaferro Clark said, &quot;The rather low intelligence of the Negro population, depressed economic conditions, and the common promiscuous sex relations not only contribute to the spread of syphilis but the prevailing indifference with regards to treatment.&quot; In reality, the promise of medical treatment, usually reserved only for emergencies among the rural black population of Macon County, Alabama, was what secured subjects&#x27; cooperation in the study.

===Public trust===
The revelations of mistreatment under the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee are believed to have significantly damaged the trust of the black community toward public health efforts in the United States. Observers believe that the abuses of the study may have contributed to the reluctance of many poor black people to seek routine preventive care. A 1999 survey showed that 80% of African-American men wrongly believed the men in the study had been injected with syphilis.

While the final report of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee noted that the study had contributed to fears among the African American community of abuse and exploitation by government officials and medical professionals, medical mistreatment of African Americans and resulting mistrust predates the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Vanessa Northington Gamble, who had chaired the committee, addressed this in a seminal article published in 1997 after President Clinton&#x27;s apology. She argued that while the Tuskegee Syphilis Study contributed to African Americans&#x27; continuing mistrust of the biomedical community, the study was not the most important reason. She called attention to a broader historical and social context that had already negatively influenced community attitudes, including countless prior medical injustices before the study&#x27;s start in 1932. These dated back to the antebellum period, when slaves had been used for unethical and harmful experiments including tests of endurance against and remedies for heatstroke and experimental gynecological surgeries without anesthesia. African Americans&#x27; graves were robbed to provide cadavers for dissection, a practice that continued, along with other abuses, after the American Civil War.

A 2016 paper by Marcella Alsan and Marianne Wanamaker found &quot;that the historical disclosure of the [Tuskegee experiment] in 1972 is correlated with increases in medical mistrust and mortality and decreases in both outpatient and inpatient physician interactions for older black men. Our estimates imply life expectancy at age 45 for black men fell by up to 1.4 years in response to the disclosure, accounting for approximately 35% of the 1980 life expectancy gap between black and white men.&quot;

Studies that have investigated the willingness of black Americans to participate in medical studies have not drawn consistent conclusions related to the willingness and participation in studies by racial minorities. The Tuskegee Legacy Project Questionnaire found that, even though black Americans are four times more likely to know about the syphilis trials than are whites, they are two to three times more willing to participate in biomedical studies. Some of the factors that continue to limit the credibility of these few studies is how awareness differs significantly across studies. For instance, it appears that the rates of awareness differ as a function of the method of assessment. Study participants who reported awareness of the Tuskegee syphilis study are often misinformed about the results and issues, and awareness of the study is not reliably associated with unwillingness to participate in scientific research.

Distrust of the government, in part formed through the study, contributed to persistent rumors during the 1980s in the black community that the government was responsible for the HIV/AIDS crisis by having deliberately introduced the virus to the black community as some kind of experiment. In February 1992 on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Prime Time Live&quot;, journalist Jay Schadler interviewed Dr. Sidney Olansky, Public Health Services director of the study from 1950 to 1957. When asked about the lies that were told to the study subjects, Olansky said, &quot;The fact that they were illiterate was helpful, too, because they couldn&#x27;t read the newspapers. If they were not, as things moved on they might have been reading newspapers and seen what was going on.&quot;

On January 3, 2019, a United States federal judge stated that Johns Hopkins University, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Rockefeller Foundation must face a $1 billion lawsuit for their roles in a similar experiment affecting Guatemalans. In 2001, a court compared the Kennedy Krieger Institute&#x27;s Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Repair and Maintenance Study to the Tuskegee experiments.

Some African Americans have been hesitant to get vaccinated against COVID-19 due to the Tuskegee experiments. In September 2021, the right-wing group America&#x27;s Frontline Doctors, which has promoted COVID-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, filed a lawsuit against New York City, claiming that its vaccine passport health orders were inherently discriminatory against African Americans due to the &quot;historical context&quot;.

==Ethical implications==
The U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee highlighted issues in race and science. The aftershocks of this study, and other human experiments in the United States, led to the establishment of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research and the National Research Act. The latter requires the establishment of institutional review boards (IRBs) at institutions receiving federal support (such as grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts). Foreign consent procedures can be substituted which offer similar protections and must be submitted to the &quot;Federal Register&quot; unless a statute or Executive Order requires otherwise.

In the period following World War II, the revelation of the Holocaust and related Nazi medical abuses brought about changes in international law. Western allies formulated the Nuremberg Code to protect the rights of research subjects. In 1964, the World Medical Association&#x27;s Declaration of Helsinki specified that experiments involving human beings needed the &quot;informed consent&quot; of participants. In spite of these events, the protocols of the study were not re-evaluated according to the new standards, even though whether or not the study should continue was re-evaluated several times (including in 1969 by the CDC). U.S. government officials and medical professionals kept silent and the study did not end until 1972, nearly three decades after the Nuremberg trials.

Writer James Jones said that the physicians were fixated on African-American sexuality. They believed that African-Americans willingly had sexual relations with infected persons (although no one had been told his diagnosis). Due to the lack of information, the participants were manipulated into continuing the study without full knowledge of their role or their choices. Since the late 20th century, IRBs established in association with clinical studies requirements that all involved in the study be willing and voluntary participants.

The Tuskegee University Legacy Museum has on display a check issued by the United States government on behalf of Dan Carlis to Lloyd Clements, Jr., a descendant of one of the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee participants. Lloyd Clements, Jr.&#x27;s great-grandfather Dan Carlis and two of his uncles, Ludie Clements and Sylvester Carlis, were in the study. Original legal paperwork for Sylvester Carlis related to the study is on display at the museum as well. Lloyd Clements, Jr. has worked with noted historian Susan Reverby concerning his family&#x27;s involvement with the U.S. Public Health Service Syphilis Study at Tuskegee.

<text>Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Horton (died April 10, 1989) was a senior vice-president of Southern Company&#x27;s Gulf Power Unit, killed when a corporate airplane caught fire and crashed into a Pensacola apartment complex, shortly after takeoff from Pensacola, Florida. Journalist Greg Palast has alleged that Horton was murdered by the corporation, in order to prevent him from accusing the board of directors of making illegal payments to politicians &quot;(1 -- p. 109)&quot;.

Prior to 2019, Southern Company also owned Gulf Power, an electric utility based in Pensacola, Florida that serves most of the Florida Panhandle. An agreement was reached in May 2018 to sell Gulf Power to rival utility company NextEra Energy. The sale was completed on January 1, 2019. Gulf Power would become the Northwest Florida division of Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) in 2021, with the Gulf Power name retired in favor of FPL in 2022.

==History==

Southern Company can be traced back to 1924, when Southeastern Power &amp; Light was formed as a holding company for Alabama Traction, Light and Power (formed 1906), the immediate forerunner of Alabama Power. Later that year, it formed Mississippi Power as a subsidiary, with Gulf Power following in 1925. In 1926, it merged with Georgia Power (formed 1902). In 1930, Southeastern Power &amp; Light merged into the Commonwealth &amp; Southern Corporation. The new system included five Northern companies and six Southern companies. However, in the late 1940s Commonwealth &amp; Southern was dissolved to meet the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Four of Commonwealth &amp; Southern&#x27;s Deep South operating companies—Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power—were deemed to be an integrated system and thus were allowed to remain under common ownership. A new holding company, Southern Company, was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 1945. It commenced operation in 1949, and moved to Georgia in 1950. In 1954–55, the company was involved in the Dixon-Yates contract with the Atomic Energy Commission, and the associated political controversy.

In 1981, Southern Company became the first electric utility holding company in 46 years to diversify its operations by forming an unregulated subsidiary. In January 1982, Southern Energy, Inc., began official operations as a global energy company, growing to serve 10 countries on four continents. On April 2, 2001, Southern Company completed the spinoff of Southern Energy as Mirant Corporation.

Another Southern Company subsidiary—Southern Nuclear—began providing services in 1991 to the system&#x27;s nuclear power plants.

In 1996, Southern Communications Services began providing digital wireless communications services to Southern Company&#x27;s subsidiaries and also began marketing these services to the public within the Southeast as Southern Linc. Southern Telecom, a telecommunications subsidiary of Southern Company, was founded in 1997. Southern Telecom provides colocation and dark fiber optic lines to network businesses.

On January 9, 2001, Southern Company received final approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to form Southern Power, a subsidiary to own, manage and finance wholesale generating assets in the Southeast. The new subsidiary targets wholesale customers.

On July 19, 2002, Southern Company Gas received certification from the Georgia Public Service Commission to enter the retail gas market. After nearly four years of operations, the company was sold and customers transferred to Cobb EMC&#x27;s newly formed affiliate, Gas South.

In 2011, Southern Company and Turner Renewable Energy purchased a 30 MW solar project from First Solar. Located in Cimarron, New Mexico, it began generating electricity in 2011.

In June 2012, the Nacogdoches Generating Facility began its commercial operation. The facility is a 115 MW biomass-fueled electric generating plant, located near Sacul in Nacogdoches County, Texas.

In 2016, Southern Company acquired PowerSecure, a distributed energy infrastructure technologies company, and AGL Resources (which was renamed Southern Company Gas). The takeover of AGL was valued at $12 billion, including $8 billion of equity. As a result of the AGL Resources merger, Southern Company doubled its customer base to approximately 9 million and expanded its footprint and broadened the scope of its business by increasing its natural gas presence.

In 2018, Southern Company sold Gulf Power and its gas plant shares of 100% in Plant Oleander and 65% in Stanton Energy Center to NextEra for $6.5 billion.

In September 2023, it was announced Southern Company&#x27;s subsidiary, Southern Power had acquired the 200MW Millers Branch Solar Facility in Haskell County, Texas from EDF Renewables North America, for an undisclosed amount.

== Plant Vogtle ==

Southern Company subsidiaries operate hydroelectric, gas, coal, and nuclear generation sources to generate approximately 200 terawatt-hours of electricity. In 2009, coal represented 57 percent of the company&#x27;s output, followed by nuclear (23%) and natural gas (16%). Renewable hydroelectric power represented 4 percent of Southern&#x27;s generation. Coal-based generation dropped significantly in 2009 from an average of 70% between 2005 and 2008. As of 2017 Coal-based generation had dropped to 30%.

In June 2010, the United States Department of Energy awarded an $8.3 billion loan guarantee to facilitate the construction of two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, near Augusta, Georgia. A Southern Company subsidiary, Georgia Power, owns 45.7% of the current 2,430 MW facility, with co-owners Oglethorpe Power (30%) Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7%) and the City of Dalton (1.6%). The plant is operated by Georgia Power. The $14 billion construction project is scheduled to be completed by 2022 and would double the plant&#x27;s capacity.

The construction of two 1,154 MW reactors has been hailed by Energy Secretary Steven Chu as &quot;the first new nuclear power plant to break ground in decades&quot;. It is expected to create up to 3,500 jobs during the construction phase, and 800 once operational. However, in March 2017 Westinghouse Electric Company, who were building the plant, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because of $9 billion of losses from its two U.S. nuclear construction projects. The U.S. government had given $8.3 billion of loan guarantees on the financing of the four nuclear reactors being built in the U.S., and it is expected a way forward to completing the plant can be agreed.

Commercial operations of the plant’s Unit 3 began in July 2023, while Unit 4’s commercial operations began in April 2024. The added reactors will supply enough energy for about 1 million customers.

==Plant Ratcliffe==
In September 2013 the EPA introduced new provisions regarding output of carbon emissions in new power facilities. The proposed emission limit for new energy sources will be 1,100lbs of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of electricity. Preemptively recognizing the need for these changes, Southern Company broke ground on its 21st-century clean coal facility in June 2010. Southern&#x27;s subsidiary, Mississippi Power will operate the plant. The Kemper County Energy Facility, or Kemper Project, takes advantage of the abundant lignite, or poor quality coal, available in Mississippi. Additionally, it employs Transport Gasifier (TRIG) technology. TRIG technology is built on the idea of dry-feed, non-slag gasifiers, which operate at lower temperatures than other coal gasifiers. This dry-feed is crushed, heated, and circulated in the gasifier, producing a flammable synthetic gas, syngas. Syngas can generate electricity with fewer emissions. Of course, other byproducts are produced, like ammonia and sulphuric acid. These particular products are sold for commercial use.

The EPA considers the Kemper Coal Project and other planned facilities like it, to be a lifeline for the coal industry in the wake of the new climate change plan. Between 2010 and 2014, approximately 150 coal plants were shut down.

As of April 2014, the US Department of Energy had invested $270m in this project. Southern Company, and its subsidiary, Mississippi Power anticipate that the Kemper Coal Plant will generate enough energy to serve more than 187,000 customers. Upon opening, the Kemper Coal Project is expected to be capable of stripping out at least 65% of the carbon dioxide, significantly exceeding the EPA&#x27;s proposed requirement of 40%.

==Partnerships==
Southern Company works with the U.S. Department of Energy on a variety of projects including transmission and distribution of infrastructure and smart grid initiatives, environmental research programs, and nuclear generation. One of the more significant joint efforts, the DOE&#x27;s National Carbon Capture Center, is managed by Southern Company and represents national efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-based power generation. At this location, Southern Company has been working with scientists and technology developers from government, industry, and universities who are creating the next generation of carbon capture technologies.

Along with the DOE, Southern Company has been working with KBR, another technology partner, to perfect its TRIG advanced coal gasification technology. This process of breaking down &quot;dirty coal&quot;, or lignite, into its chemical components is not only cleaner, but it is also less expensive and more reliable. This technology is currently being implemented at Southern Company&#x27;s Kemper County power plant, one of the few new coal facilities working to keep the U.S. coal industry alive. This new facility will be built on a lignite seam, is expected to strip out two-thirds of carbon dioxide emissions, leaving emissions at about the same level as natural gas. The Kemper Coal Plant is expected to fall well under new regulations implemented by the EPA, which limits coal plants to 1,100lbs of carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour of electricity.

In an effort to make this technology more attainable, Southern Company has partnered with China&#x27;s Shenhua Group to collaborate on further research, development, and deployment of clean coal technologies in the US, China, and around the world. This partnership with Shenhua, who is currently expected to add more than 400,000 megawatts of coal-fired capacity by 2035, could lead to wide deployment of TRIG-equipped power plants across Asia. TRIG technology has the potential to not only assist China with their growing carbon issue, but also enable the country to tap into their own low quality coal.

In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy granted Southern Company a $165 million Smart Grid Investment Grant to implement a smart grid and to make the grid more reliable. Through matching funds and other investments, the company spent $363 million on the initiative, which it completed in 2014. The upgraded smart grid allows Southern Company the ability to monitor and control its electric infrastructure in real time and respond to problems.

== Financial data ==
==Carbon footprint==
Southern Company reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 75,300 Kt (-13,100 /-14.8% y-o-y) and aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

==Political donations==
In May 2018, it was reported that Southern Company had donated $1 million to America First Policies, a pro-Donald Trump advocacy group.

==Controversies==
=== Environmental impact ===
Southern Company is the third-largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, emitting 86,244,286 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019.

In 2005, the company announced it would open a Mercury Research Center at Plant Crist Pensacola, Florida, hoping to find new ways to reduce mercury emissions.

On April 25, 2006, Alabama Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, agreed to pay $200M to settle allegations that its coal-fired James H. Miller, Jr. Plant near West Jefferson, Alabama emitted harmful amounts of SO2 and NOx.

In response to growing public and financial community interest, the company has enacted assorted environmental measures. Southern Company participates in &quot;Renew Our Rivers&quot;, a volunteer program to remove debris from rivers and other waterways throughout the Southeast, which claims over 11 million pounds of trash removed or recycled in Renew Our Rivers events. The company also manages and operates the National Carbon Capture Center, a focal point of the US Department of Energy&#x27;s efforts to develop carbon capture and greenhouse gas reduction technologies, under which various projects to test geologic sequestration are in progress at Plant Gorgas in Alabama, Plant Daniel in Mississippi and other company sites. However, critics have argued that CCS seldom works and prolongs the life of fossil fuels.

=== Climate change denial ===
Southern Company has a long history of funding climate change denial and has been a &quot;driving force behind climate disinformation&quot;, sponsoring campaigns in opposition to climate science, against limiting greenhouse gas emissions, and slowing the transition to renewable energy sources.

Between 1993 and 2004 Southern Company paid over $62 million to organizations that spread disinformation about climate change. The utility paid for advertising claiming that climate change was not real and made payments to public relations companies, industry groups, law firms and thinktanks to dispute the scientific consensus for climate change and attack legislative solutions. The utility paid $20 million to the trade group Edison Electric Institute, which creates media campaigns to attack proponents of global warming. In the 1990s, Southern Company and the Center for Energy and Economic Development hosted energy workshops broadcast to schoolteachers through the company&#x27;s satellite network to promote pro-coal messages about climate change and the environment.

Southern Company had spent more than $135 million from 2010 to 2020 on lobbying at a federal level.

=== Kemper Project controversies ===
In February 2015, the Mississippi Supreme Court ordered Southern Company&#x27;s subsidiary Mississippi Power to restore $377 million to South Mississippi ratepayers for rate increases related to the Kemper Project, a &quot;clean&quot; coal plant. These fees were derived from Mississippi&#x27;s Baseload Act, allowing Mississippi Power to charge ratepayers for powerplants under construction.

In May 2016, Southern Company and its subsidiary Mississippi Power announced they were being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to overruns at the Kemper Project. The project had been repeatedly delayed and costs increased from $2.88 billion to $6.58 billion. In recorded conversations, at least six engineers from the Kemper Project claimed that delays, cost overruns, safety violations, and shoddy work, were in part due to mismanagement or fraud.

In June 2016, Mississippi Power was sued by Treetop Midstream Services over the cancellation of a contract to receive carbon dioxide from the Kemper Project as part of the carbon capture and storage design. Treetop had contracted to buy carbon dioxide from the Kemper plant and had built a pipeline in preparation to receive the gas. Treetop alleged Mississippi Power had fraudulently and &quot;intentionally misrepresenting and concealing the start date&quot; for the Kemper Project, though Mississippi Power stated the suit was without merit.

The company was also found to have unlawfully fired a whistle-blower who had criticized alleged false statements by company management.

=== Vogtle nuclear power plant ===
In June 2021, Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, was scrutinized by the Georgia Public Service Commission over the lengthy delays and ballooning costs of its new Vogtle nuclear plant in Burke County, Georgia.

=== Willie Soon ===
In February 2015, it was revealed that climate change denier Willie Soon had been paid by Southern Company and several other fossil fuel interest groups. Over the course of 14 years, Soon received a total of $1.25m from Southern Company, Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and a foundation run by the Koch brothers, the documents obtained by Greenpeace show. At $469,560, Southern Company was the largest donor. The scientist described his studies to fossil fuel executives as &quot;deliverables&quot;, and permitted anonymous pre-publication reviews. Soon advanced the widely discredited theory that changes in solar activity are to blame for climate change, and called into question the severity and extent of climate change in all his studies, never revealing his backers.

<doc id="198076" wikidata="Q245385" url="?curid=198076" title="International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War">
<text>International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) is a non-partisan federation of national medical groups in 63 countries, representing doctors, medical students, other health workers, and concerned people who share the goal of creating a more peaceful and secure world free from the threat of nuclear annihilation. The organization&#x27;s headquarters is in Malden, Massachusetts. IPPNW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.

IPPNW affiliates are national medical organizations with a common commitment to the abolition of nuclear weapons and the prevention of war. Affiliates range in size from a handful of dedicated physicians and medical students to tens of thousands of activists and their supporters. As independent organizations within a global federation, IPPNW affiliates engage in a wide variety of activities related to war, health, social justice, and environmentalism.

== Formation ==
In 1961, future IPPNW founder Dr. Bernard Lown formed prevenient sister organization, the US Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) at Harvard, concerned about the medical effects of nuclear weapons and war. PSR aided in pushing the Baby Tooth Survey study to convince the then President John F. Kennedy and congress to pass the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty to end atmospheric tests.

In December 1980, following a 6 letter exchange and an April meeting in Moscow between Dr. Lown and Dr. Yevgeny Chazov of the USSR Cardiology Institute, they agreed to meet in Geneva along with Dr. Eric Chivian, James E. Muller, Herbert Abrams, Leonid Ilyin, and Mikhail Kuzin to form IPPNW. There, IPPNW vowed that its focus would be the prevention of nuclear war and to spread awareness of the medical effects and dangers of a nuclear war internationally, along with strengthening medical community ties between the Soviet Union and the US. 

== Awards ==

=== UNESCO Prize for Peace Education ===
On 30 October 1984, IPPNW received the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education at the UNESCO Headquarters in Paris, France. They received this award for &quot;hav[ing] mobilized the conscience of hundreds of thousands of people the world over in the cause of peace and against a thermonuclear holocaust.&quot;. This award was presented by Deputy Director-General Jean Knapp to the organization and Dr. Lown and Dr. Chazof both accepted the award on behalf of IPPNW.
=== Nobel Prize ===
On 10 December 1985, IPPNW was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;perform[ing] a considerable service to mankind by spreading authoritative information and by creating an awareness of the catastrophic consequences of atomic warfare.&quot; in Olso, Norway. Dr. Lown and Dr. Chazof both spoke and accepted the reward on behalf of IPPNW and the award was shared with PSR.

IPPNW is one of the 8 Nobel Peace Prize winners for nuclear advocacy, a title it shares with its daughter organization, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

==== Controversy ====
During the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony, 200 to 300 human rights advocates protested outside, citing co-recipient Dr. Yevgeny Chazof of partaking and being complicit with the 1972 political attacks against ex-Soviet physicist Dr. Andrei D. Sakharov, who himself won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize On 12 November, Heiner Geisler of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany wrote a letter to the award committee denouncing Dr. Chazof and informing the committee of his actions. This had little effect on the delivery of the award as Committee Chairman Egil Aarvik declared in his speech, &quot;This year’s prize is more concerned with the problem of disarmament, but is also at a deeper level concerned with human rights, perhaps even the most fundamental human right of them all, the right to live.&quot;.

==Organizational History==
IPPNW was founded in 1980 by physicians from the United States and the Soviet Union who shared a common commitment to the prevention of nuclear war between their two countries. Citing a principle of the medical profession—that doctors have an obligation to prevent what they cannot treat—a global federation of physician experts came together to explain the medical and scientific facts about nuclear war to policy makers and to the public, and to advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons from the world&#x27;s arsenals.

Founding co-presidents Bernard Lown of the United States and Yevgeniy Chazov of the Soviet Union were joined by other early IPPNW leaders including James E. Muller, Ioan Moraru of Romania, Eric Chivian and Herb Abrams of the US and Mikhail Kuzin and Leonid Ilyin of the Soviet Union. They organized a team to conduct scientific research based on data collected by Japanese colleagues who had studied the effects of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and drew upon their knowledge of the medical effects of burn, blast, and radiation injuries.

The doctors sounded a warning: that nuclear war would be the final epidemic; that there would be no cure and no meaningful medical response. Their message reached millions of people around the world. In the words of former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, &quot;IPPNW made medical reality a part of political reality.&quot;

In its first five years, IPPNW, working closely with its US affiliate Physicians for Social Responsibility and IPPNW-Russia, educated health professionals, political leaders, and the public about the medical and environmental consequences of nuclear warfare. For this effort, which united physicians across the Cold War divide, IPPNW was awarded the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education in 1984 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985. The Nobel Committee, in its announcement of the award, said IPPNW &quot;has performed a considerable service to mankind by spreading authoritative information and by creating an awareness of the catastrophic consequences of atomic warfare.&quot;

Although the Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US and Russia retained thousands of nuclear weapons ready to launch. Nuclear proliferation and the threat of nuclear terrorism have added to the danger in the post-Cold-War world.

During the 1990s, IPPNW established an International Commission to Investigate the Health and Environmental Effects of Nuclear Weapons Production and Testing and worked with the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research to document these effects. The Commission produced a series of books including &quot;Radioactive Heaven and Earth&quot;, &quot;Plutonium: The Deadly Gold of the Nuclear Age&quot;, and &quot;Nuclear Wastelands&quot;, a comprehensive study of the health and environmental impact of the global nuclear weapons production complex.

In October 2007, IPPNW and the Royal Society of Medicine co-sponsored a major conference in London to review the current state of knowledge about the effects of nuclear weapons. Scientific data on the global climate effects of regional nuclear war presented at that conference became the basis of an IPPNW project on &quot;nuclear famine&quot;. The findings and an updated summary of the medical consequences of nuclear war are available in an IPPNW publication, &quot;Zero Is the Only Option: Four Medical and Environmental Cases for Eradicating Nuclear Weapons&quot;.

In recent years, IPPNW and its affiliates have drawn new attention to the health and environmental effects of uranium mining and processing, conducting community health surveys in India and challenging Australia&#x27;s plans to expand its uranium export industry. In 2010, the federation&#x27;s international council passed a resolution calling for a global ban on uranium mining because of the dangers it poses to health and the environment.

IPPNW has also studied a nuclear danger within the medical profession—the use of highly enriched uranium in reactors that produce medical isotopes—and has campaigned for the conversion of those vulnerable reactors to non-weapons-grade uranium.

IPPNW launched the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) in 2007, and is now the lead medical NGO campaigning for a global treaty to ban and eliminate nuclear weapons, along with more than 200 humanitarian, environmental, human rights, peace and development organizations in more than 80 countries. ICAN went on to receive the 2017 Nobel Prize for peace.

In the 1990s, IPPNW expanded its scope to address the continuum of armed violence that undermines health and security. IPPNW is committed to ending war and to addressing the causes of armed conflict from a public health perspective. The global campaign to ban landmines marked IPPNW&#x27;s first major entry into the non-nuclear arena. The federation became engaged in addressing small arms violence in 2001 when it launched Aiming for Prevention, which has since broadened to include the public health dimensions of all types of armed violence. Aiming for Prevention has been driven by IPPNW affiliates from the global South—primarily Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South Asia—whose members live and work in areas where armed violence is a constant threat and consumes significant portions of health care budgets.

As part of Aiming for Prevention, IPPNW participated in a broad-based global coalition of civil society organizations that campaigned successfully for passage of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). IPPNW is an active participant in the World Health Organization&#x27;s Violence Prevention Alliance, and coordinates the &quot;International Action Network on Small Arms&quot; (IANSA) Public Health Network.

Continuing medical education courses in the emerging field of peace through health have been developed by IPPNW with university affiliates in Norway, Denmark, the UK, and Canada. IPPNW supports and encourages academic work to advance the understanding of the interconnections between peace and health.

<doc id="198078" wikidata="Q13226541" url="?curid=198078" title="Human spaceflight programs">
<text>Human spaceflight programs have been conducted, started, or planned by multiple countries and companies. Until the 21st century, human spaceflight programs were sponsored exclusively by governments, through either the military or civilian space agencies. With the launch of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of human spaceflight programs – commercial human spaceflight – arrived. By the end of 2022, three countries (Soviet Union/Russia, United States and China) and one private company (SpaceX) had successfully launched humans to Earth orbit, and two private companies (Scaled Composites and Blue Origin) had launched humans on a suborbital trajectory.

The criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary. The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale defines spaceflight as any flight over . In the United States professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of are awarded the United States Astronaut Badge. This article follows the FAI definition of spaceflight.

==Successful programs==

Programs in this section are sorted by the years when the first successful crewed spaceflight took place.

===Vostok program (USSR, 1956–1964)===

The Vostok program was a project that succeeded in putting a person into orbit for the first time. Sergei Korolev and Konstantin Feoktistov began, in June 1956, crewed spacecraft research. The program developed the Vostok spacecraft from the Zenit spy satellite project and adapted the Vostok rocket from an existing ICBM design. Just before the first release of the name Vostok to the press, it was a classified word. By August/September 1958 a division had been formed devoted to producing the first Vostok craft. The official approval (decree) for the Vostok was delayed until 22 May 1959 by competition with photo reconnaissance programs.

Vostok 1 was the first human spaceflight. The Vostok 3KA spacecraft was launched on April 12, 1961, taking into space Yuri Gagarin, a cosmonaut from the Soviet Union. The Vostok 1 mission was the first time anyone had journeyed into outer space and the first time anyone had entered into orbit.

There were six Vostok flights in total, including the June, 1963 Vostok 6 mission flown by Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space. Another seven Vostok flights (Vostok 7 to 13) were originally planned, going through to April 1966, but these were canceled and the components recycled into the Voskhod program, which was intended to achieve more Soviet firsts in space.

===Project Mercury (USA, 1959–1963)===
Project Mercury was the first human spaceflight program of the United States. It ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the Earth. John Glenn&#x27;s Mercury-Atlas 6 flight on 20 February 1962 was the first Mercury flight to achieve this goal. Prior to that, the Mercury-Redstone 3 mission brought the first American into space, Alan Shepard. It featured the first manual pilot control of the spacecraft and the landing with pilot still within it.

Early planning and research was carried out by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and the program was officially conducted by the newly created NASA.

Because of their small size it was said that the Mercury spacecraft capsules were worn, not ridden. With of habitable volume, the capsule was just large enough for the single crew member. Inside were 120 controls: 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. The spacecraft was designed by Max Faget and NASA&#x27;s Space Task Group.

NASA ordered 20 production spacecraft, numbered 1 through 20, from McDonnell Aircraft Company, St. Louis, Missouri. Five of the twenty spacecraft, #10, 12, 15, 17, and 19, were not flown. Spacecraft #3 and #4 were destroyed during uncrewed test flights. Spacecraft #11 sank and was recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after 38 years. Some spacecraft were modified after initial production (refurbished after launch abort, modified for longer missions, etc.) and received a letter designation after their number, examples 2A, 15B. Some spacecraft were modified twice; for example, spacecraft 15 became 15A and then 15B.

===North American X-15 (USA, 1954–1968)===

The North American X-15 rocket-powered aircraft was part of the X-series of experimental aircraft, initiated with the Bell X-1, that were made for the USAF, NASA, and the USN. The X-15 set speed and altitude records in the early 1960s, reaching the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design. It currently holds the world record for the fastest speed ever reached by a crewed aircraft.

During the X-15 program, 13 of the flights (by eight pilots) met the USAF spaceflight criteria by exceeding the altitude of , thus qualifying the pilots for astronaut status; some pilots also qualified for NASA astronaut wings.
===Voskhod program (USSR, 1964–1965)===

The Voskhod program (, &quot;ascent&quot;, &quot;dawn&quot;) was a Soviet human spaceflight project. Voskhod development was a follow-on to the Vostok program, recycling components left over from that program&#x27;s cancellation following its first six flights. The two missions flown used the Voskhod spacecraft and rocket.

The Voskhod spacecraft was basically a Vostok spacecraft that had a backup, solid fuel retrorocket added to the top of the descent module. The heavier weight of the craft was made possible by improvements to the R-7 Semyorka-derived booster. The ejection seat was removed and two or three crew couches were added to the interior at a 90-degree angle to that of the Vostok crew position. However, the position of the in-flight controls was not changed, so the crew had to crane their heads 90 degrees to see the instruments.

While the Vostok program was dedicated towards understanding the effects of space travel and microgravity on the human body, Voskhod&#x27;s two flights were aimed towards spectacular &quot;firsts&quot;. Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov made the first EVA (&quot;spacewalk&quot;) during Voskhod 2, which became the main success of the program, while putting the first multi-person crew into orbit during Voskhod 1 was the objective that initially motivated it. Once both goals were realized, the program was abandoned. This followed the change in Soviet leadership, which was less concerned about stunt and prestige flights, and allowed the Soviet designers to concentrate on the Soyuz program.

===Project Gemini (USA, 1965–1966)===
Project Gemini was the second human spaceflight program conducted by NASA. It operated between Projects Mercury and Apollo, with 10 crewed flights occurring in 1965 and 1966. Its objective was to develop techniques for advanced space travel, notably those necessary for Project Apollo, whose objective was to land humans on the Moon. Gemini missions included the first American extravehicular activity, and new orbital maneuvers including rendezvous and docking.

Gemini was originally seen as a simple extrapolation of the Mercury program, and thus early on was called &quot;Mercury Mark II&quot;. The actual program had little in common with Mercury and was superior to even Apollo in some ways. This was mainly a result of its late start date, which allowed it to benefit from much that had been learned during the early stages of the Apollo project (which, despite its later launch dates, actually began before Gemini).

===Soyuz program (USSR/Russia, 1967–ongoing)===
The Soyuz program (, , meaning &quot;Union&quot;) is a human spaceflight program that was initiated by the Soviet Union in early 1967. It was originally part of a Moon landing program intended to put a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. All experimental or unsuccessful starts received the status of satellites of a series Kosmos, and flights of the Lunar orbital ships around the Moon – the name Zond. Both the Soyuz spacecraft and the Soyuz rocket are part of this program, which is now the responsibility of the Russian Federal Space Agency.

The basic Soyuz spacecraft design was the basis for many projects, many of which never came to light. Its earliest form was intended to travel to the Moon without employing a huge booster like the Saturn V or the Soviet N-1 by repeatedly docking with upper stages that had been put in orbit using the same rocket as the Soyuz. This and the initial civilian designs were done under the Soviet Chief Designer Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, who did not live to see the craft take flight. Several military derivatives actually took precedence in the Soviet design process, though they never came to pass.

The launch vehicles used in the Soyuz expendable launch system are manufactured at the Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center (TsSKB-Progress) in Samara, Russia. As well as being used in the Soyuz program as the launcher for the crewed Soyuz spacecraft, Soyuz launch vehicles are now also used to launch robotic Progress supply spacecraft to the International Space Station and commercial launches marketed and operated by TsSKB-Progress and the Starsem company. There were 11 Soyuz launches in 2001 and 9 in 2002. Currently, Soyuz vehicles are launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwest Russia. Since 2009 Soyuz launch vehicles are also being launched from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana.

===Apollo Program (USA, 1961–1975)===
The Apollo Program was undertaken by NASA during the years 1961–1975 with the goal of conducting crewed Moon landing missions. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy announced a goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. It was accomplished on July 20, 1969, by the landing of astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, with Michael Collins orbiting above during the Apollo 11 mission. Five other Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last one in 1972. These six Apollo spaceflights are the only times humans have landed on another celestial body.

Apollo was the third human spaceflight program undertaken by NASA, the space agency of the United States. It used Apollo spacecraft and Saturn launch vehicles, which were later used for the Skylab program and the joint American-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. These later programs are thus often considered to be part of the overall Apollo program.

The goal of the program, as articulated by President Kennedy, was accomplished with only two major failures. The first failure resulted in the deaths of three astronauts, Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, in the Apollo 1 launchpad fire. The second was an in-space explosion on Apollo 13, which badly damaged the spacecraft on the moonward leg of its journey. The three astronauts aboard narrowly escaped with their lives, thanks to the efforts of flight controllers, project engineers, backup crew members and the skills of the astronauts themselves.

===Space Shuttle (USA, 1972–2011)===

NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle, officially called &quot;Space Transportation System&quot; (STS), was a United States government crewed launch vehicle, retired from service in 2011. The winged Space Shuttle orbiter was launched vertically, usually carrying five to seven astronauts (although eight have been carried) and up to of payload into low Earth orbit. When its mission was complete, the shuttle could independently move itself out of orbit (by means of making a 180-degree turn and firing its main engines, thus slowing it down) and re-enter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. During descent and landing, the orbiter acted as a glider and made a completely unpowered runway landing.

The Space Shuttle was the only winged spacecraft to achieve orbit and land with crew aboard, and the first of a small number of reusable space vehicles to make multiple flights into orbit (subsequently followed by the X-37B, Cargo Dragon, and Crew Dragon). Its missions involved carrying large payloads to various low-Earth orbits (including segments to be added to the International Space Station), providing crew rotation for the International Space Station, and performing service missions to the Hubble Space Telescope. The orbiter could also recover satellites and other payloads from orbit and return them to Earth, but its use in this capacity was rare. However, the Space Shuttle was used to return large payloads from the ISS to Earth, as the Russian Soyuz spacecraft has limited capacity for return payloads. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years&#x27; operational life.

===China Manned Space Program (China, 1992–ongoing)===

China was the first Asian country and third nation in the world, after the USSR and USA, to send humans into space. During the Space Race between the two superpowers, which culminated with Apollo 11 landing humans on the Moon, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai decided on 14 July 1967 that China should not be left behind, and initiated their own crewed space program: the top-secret Project 714, which aimed to put two people into space by 1973 with the Shuguang spacecraft. Nineteen PLAAF pilots were selected for this goal in March 1971. The Shuguang-1 spacecraft, to be launched with the CZ-2A rocket, was designed to carry a crew of two. The program was officially cancelled on 13 May 1972 for economic reasons.

A second, short-lived crewed program was based on the successful implementation of landing technology by FSW satellites. It was announced a few times in 1978 with the publishing of some details, including photos, but then was abruptly canceled in 1980. It has been argued that the second crewed program was created solely for propaganda purposes, and was never intended to produce results.

In 1992, under China Manned Space Program (CMS), also known as &quot;Project 921&quot;, authorization and funding was given for the first phase of a third, successful attempt at crewed spaceflight. To achieve independent human spaceflight capability, China developed Shenzhou spacecraft and Long March 2F rocket dedicated for human spaceflight in the next few years, along with critical infrastructures like new launch site and flight control center being built. The first uncrewed spacecraft, &quot;Shenzhou 1&quot;, was launched on 20 November 1999 and recovered the next day, marking the first step of the realization of China&#x27;s human spaceflight capability. Three more uncrewed missions were conducted in the next few years in order to verify the key technologies. On 15 October 2003 &quot;Shenzhou 5&quot;, China&#x27;s first crewed spaceflight mission, put Yang Liwei in orbit for 21 hours and returned safely back to Inner Mongolia, making China the third nation to launch a human into orbit independently.

===SpaceShipOne / SpaceShipTwo (USA, 2004–ongoing)===

Virgin Galactic is a company within Sir Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group, which is developing a privately funded spacecraft called SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo, in conjunction with Scaled Composites to offer sub-orbital spaceflights and later orbital spaceflights to the paying public. SpaceShipOne reached space with a pilot in three test flights in 2004.

Tier One is Scaled Composites&#x27; program of suborbital human spaceflight using the reusable spacecraft SpaceShipOne and its launcher White Knight. The craft are designed by Burt Rutan, and the project is funded 20 million US Dollars by Paul Allen. In 2004 it made the first privately funded human spaceflight and won the 10 million US Dollars Ansari X Prize for the first non-governmental reusable crewed spacecraft.

The objective of the project is to develop technology for low-cost routine access to space. Tier One is not itself intended to carry paying passengers, but it is envisioned that there will be commercial spinoffs, initially in space tourism. The company Mojave Aerospace Ventures was formed to manage commercial exploitation of the technology. A deal with Virgin Galactic could see routine space tourism, using a spacecraft based on Tier One technology.

The model finally developed into SpaceShipTwo, Virgin Galactic&#x27;s second generation suborbital vehicle. On 10 October 2010, VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane, made its first crewed gliding test flight. By October 2014 SpaceShipTwo had conducted 54 test flights. On October 31, 2014, SpaceShipTwo VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot; suffered an in-flight breakup during a powered flight test, resulting in a crash killing one pilot and injuring the other. The second SpaceShipTwo, VSS Unity, made first flight tests in 2016. VSS Unity made its first spaceflight (according to the U.S. definition of space) on December 13, 2018. Marking the end of the &quot;shuttle gap.&quot; VSS Unity made its second spaceflight on February 22, 2019.

===Commercial Crew Program (USA, 2011–ongoing)===
The Commercial Crew Program is an economic stimulus program funds technology development related to human spaceflight by private companies. In September 2014 NASA awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing to build crewed spacecraft for low Earth orbit operations. Dragon 2, the capsule developed by SpaceX, is listed under &quot;successful programs&quot; as it first launched humans to space in May 2020.

==== Dragon 2 (USA, 2010–ongoing) ====

The SpaceX Dragon 2 is a development of the robotic Dragon cargo spacecraft which has been re-supplying the International Space Station since 2010. The spacecraft is able to carry a crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station, with a planned maximum capacity of seven.
It includes a set of four side-mounted thruster pods with two SuperDraco engines each as Launch Abort System (LAS).

To develop Dragon 2, SpaceX did a &quot;pad abort&quot; test in May 2015. A one-week uncrewed orbital flight to the ISS occurred in March 2019, an in-flight abort test was successfully conducted on 19 January 2020. A crewed demonstration mission to the ISS launched on 30 May 2020. The first operational crewed mission, Crew-1, flew to the ISS in November 2020 for a six month stay. Dragon 2 has flown Inspiration4, the first purely private mission to Earth orbit.

====Starliner (USA, 2010–ongoing)====

The Boeing Starliner is a class of space capsules under construction by Boeing to transport crew to the International Space Station, and to private space stations such as the proposed Bigelow Aerospace Commercial Space Station. The Starliner is to support larger crews of up to seven people. The Starliner is designed to be able to remain on-orbit for up to seven months and for reusability for up to ten missions.

Starliner made an uncrewed test flight in December 2019 but failed to reach the ISS. Another uncrewed flight was launched in May 2022, followed by final certification crewed demonstration flight to get Starliner operational in June 2024.

===New Shepard (USA, 2006–ongoing)===
The New Shepard is a reusable launch system capable of vertical-takeoff, vertical-landing (VTVL), suborbital crewed spacecraft by Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder and businessman Jeff Bezos, flying humans to space since 2021. It is a commercial system for suborbital space tourism.
The name New Shepard makes reference to the first United States astronaut in space, Alan Shepard.

The first flight of the New Shepard vehicle was conducted on 29 April 2015 during which an altitude of was attained. While the test itself was deemed a success and the capsule was correctly recovered via parachute landing, the booster stage landing failed because hydraulic pressure was lost during the descent. Twelve subsequent flights (through January 2019), including two in-flight abort tests, took place with safe landings of both capsule and booster with two additional vehicles. New Shepard first flew humans to space on 20 July 2021 with the NS-16 mission.

==Successful space station programs==

(Dates refer to periods when stations were inhabited by crews.)

===Salyut stations (USSR, 1971–1986)===

The Salyut program was the world&#x27;s first space station program undertaken by the Soviet Union, which consisted of a series of four crewed scientific research space stations and two crewed military reconnaissance space stations over a period of 15 years from 1971 to 1986. Two other Salyut launches failed. Salyut was, on the one hand, designed to carry out long-term research into the problems of living in space and a variety of astronomical, biological and Earth-resources experiments, and on the other hand this civilian program was used as a cover for the highly secretive military Almaz stations, which flew under the Salyut designation. Salyut 1, the first station in the program, became the world&#x27;s first crewed space station. Salyut broke several spaceflight records, including several mission duration records, the first ever orbital handover of a space station from one crew to another, and various spacewalk records. The program went through various changes.

*Salyut 1/DOS-1 (1971, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 2/Almaz/OPS-1 (1973, failed shortly after launch)
*Salyut 3/Almaz/OPS-2 (1974, 1 crew and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 4/DOS-4 (1975–1976, 2 crews)
*Salyut 5/Almaz/OPS-3 (1976–1977, 2 crews and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 6/DOS-5 (1977–1981, 16 crews (5 long duration, 11 short duration) and 1 failed docking)
*Salyut 7/DOS-6 (1982–1986, 10 crews (6 long duration, 4 short duration) and 1 failed docking)

===Skylab (USA, 1973–1974)===

Skylab was launched and operated by NASA and was the United States&#x27; first space station. Skylab orbited Earth from 1973 to 1979, and included a workshop, a solar observatory, and other systems. It was launched uncrewed by a modified Saturn V rocket, with a weight of . Three crewed missions to the station, conducted between 1973 and 1974 using the Apollo command and service module (CSM) atop the smaller Saturn IB, each delivered a three-astronaut crew. On the last two crewed missions, an additional Apollo / Saturn IB stood by ready to rescue the crew in orbit if it was needed.

===&quot;Mir&quot; (USSR/Russia, 1986–2001)===

&quot;Mir&quot; was the first modular space station and was assembled in orbit from 1986 to 1996. It had a greater mass than any previous spacecraft. Until 21 March 2001 it was the largest artificial satellite in orbit, succeeded by the International Space Station after &quot;Mir&quot; orbit decayed. The station served as a microgravity research laboratory in which crews conducted experiments in biology, human biology, physics, astronomy, meteorology and spacecraft systems with a goal of developing technologies required for permanent occupation of space.

&quot;Mir&quot; was the first continuously inhabited long-term research station in orbit and set the record for the longest continuous human presence in space at 3,644 days until 23 October 2010 when it was surpassed by the ISS. It holds the record for the longest single human spaceflight, with Valeri Polyakov spending 437 days and 18 hours on the station between 1994 and 1995. &quot;Mir&quot; was occupied for a total of twelve and a half years out of its fifteen-year lifespan, having the capacity to support a resident crew of three, or larger crews for short term visits. &quot;Mir&quot; had 28 long duration crews.

===International Space Station (USA, Russia, Japan, Europe, Canada, 1998–ongoing)===
The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the largest artificial body in orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The ISS consists of pressurized modules, external trusses, solar arrays and other components. ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets as well as American Space Shuttles.

The ISS program is a joint project among five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA. The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station is divided into two sections, the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS) and the United States Orbital Segment (USOS), which is shared by many nations. The American portion of ISS was funded until 2024. Roscosmos has also endorsed the continued operation of ISS through 2024, but have proposed subsequently using elements of the Russian Orbital Segment to construct a new Russian space station called OPSEK.

As of May 2022 there have been 66 long duration crews.

=== Tiangong program (China, 2010–ongoing) ===
In 2011, China launched the Tiangong 1 target spacecraft and &quot;Shenzhou 8&quot; uncrewed spacecraft. The two spacecraft completed China&#x27;s first automatic rendezvous and docking on 3 November 2011. About 9 months later, &quot;Tiangong 1&quot; completed the first manual rendezvous and docking with &quot;Shenzhou 9&quot;, which carried China&#x27;s first female astronaut &quot;Liu Yang&quot;.

In September 2016, &quot;Tiangong 2&quot; was launched into the orbit. It was a space laboratory with more advanced functions and equipment than &quot;Tiangong 1&quot;. A month later, &quot;Shenzhou 11&quot; was launched and docked with &quot;Tiangong 2&quot;. Two astronauts entered &quot;Tiangong 2&quot; and stationed for about 30 days and verified the viability of astronauts&#x27; medium-term stay in space. In April 2017, China&#x27;s first cargo spacecraft, &quot;Tianzhou 1&quot; docked with &quot;Tiangong 2&quot; and completed multiple in-orbit propellant refueling tests.

The goal of the next phase of China Manned Space Program is to build China&#x27;s own space station, &quot;Tiangong&quot;. The first module of &quot;Tiangong&quot;, the &quot;Tianhe&quot; core module, was launched into orbit by China&#x27;s most powerful rocket Long March 5B on 29 April 2021. It was later visited by multiple cargo and crewed spacecraft and demonstrated China&#x27;s capability of sustaining Chinese astronauts&#x27; long-term stay in space.

According to CMS announcement, all missions of Tiangong Space Station are scheduled to be carried out by the end of 2022. Once the construction is completed, &quot;Tiangong&quot; will enter the application and development phase, which is poised to last for no less than 10 years.

==Space programs currently in development==
Programs in this section are sorted by the years when their development started.

===Dream Chaser (USA, 2004–ongoing)===

The Dream Chaser was originally intended to serve as an American reusable crewed suborbital and orbital lifting-body spaceplane being developed and privately funded by Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) Space Systems. It is now planned to be a robotic cargo transport to the ISS. The Dream Chaser was designed to carry up to seven people to and from low Earth orbit prior to the decision to transition to a robotic platform. The vehicle would launch vertically on an Atlas V rocket and land horizontally on conventional runways. On 26 October 2013, the first glide flight occurred. An initial orbital test flight of the Dream Chaser orbital test vehicle was planned for 1 November 2016, which was not met. On 3 February 2015, the Sierra Nevada Corporation&#x27;s (SNC) Space Systems and OHB System AG (OHB) in Germany announced the completion of the initial Dream Chaser for European Utilization (DC4EU) study.

===Indian Human Spaceflight Programme (India, 2007–ongoing)===

===SPICA (Denmark, 2008–ongoing)===
Copenhagen Suborbitals is an amateur crowd-funded, human space programme. Since its beginning in 2008, Copenhagen Suborbitals has flown five home-built rockets and two mock-up space capsules. Their stated goal is to have one of the members fly into space (above 100 km), on a sub-orbital spaceflight, in a space capsule on the Spica rocket.

HEAT 1X Tycho Brahe was the first rocket and spacecraft combination built by Copenhagen Suborbitals, a Danish organization attempting to perform the first amateur suborbital crewed spaceflight. The vehicle consisted of a motor named HEAT-1X and a spacecraft Tycho Brahe.

In 2014, Copenhagen Suborbitals settled on the basic design for their first crewed rocket and space capsule. The rocket will be named Spica, and will stand 12–14 m tall with a diameter of 950 mm. It will be powered by the BPM-100 engine class, using liquid oxygen as oxidizer and ethanol as fuel, producing 100 kilonewtons of thrust.

=== Orel (Russia, 2009–ongoing) ===
Formerly called PPTS (Prospective Piloted Transport System) and Federation (, &quot;Federatsiya&quot;) Orel is a new multi-task Russian spacecraft for LEO, ISS and lunar missions. The spacecraft, when revealed in 2015, resembled NASA&#x27;s Orion capsule and had a set of soft-landing type legs similar to the plans for Dragon 2 at that time. An uncrewed flight is planned in 2024.

===New Glenn (USA, 2012–ongoing)===
New Glenn is an orbital launch vehicle under development by Blue Origin. The company expects a first flight no earlier 2023. Like New Shepard, the first stage is designed to land vertically to be reusable. It can launch either a cargo or a crew capsule to space.

===Starship (USA, 2012-ongoing)===
The SpaceX Starship is a fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX since 2012, as a self-funded private spaceflight project.

The second stage of the Starship is designed as a long-duration cargo and passenger-carrying spacecraft. In 2020 and 2021 it was tested without a booster stage as part of the development program to get launch and landing working and iterate on a variety of design details, particularly with respect to the vehicle&#x27;s atmospheric reentry.

===Iranian crewed spaceship project (Iran, 2015–ongoing)===

The Iranian crewed spacecraft is a proposal by the Iranian Aerospace Research Institute of Iranian Space Research Center (ISRC) to put an astronaut into space. The details of the design were published by the institute in its &quot;Astronaut&quot; publication in February 2015. A mock up of the spaceship was displayed on 17 February 2015 during the ceremony of the national day of space of Iran. The head of the institute announced that the spaceship will be launched to space in about a year. The spaceship is supposed be able to carry a single astronaut to a 175 km height and return him to the Earth. The spaceship is designed under the code name &quot;Class E Kavoshgar&quot; project. Through December 2022, no further details have been published and no crewed launches have occurred.

===Artemis program (USA, 2017–ongoing)===

The Artemis program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by NASA, U.S. commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such as ESA, with the goal of landing &quot;the first woman and the next man&quot; on the lunar south pole region by 2025. Artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars.

Artemis I was the first mission of the Artemis Program and was the first integrated flight of the Space Launch System and the Orion (spacecraft). During the mission, an uncrewed Orion capsule spent 10 days in a distant retrograde orbit around the Moon before returning to Earth.

Artemis II, the first crewed mission of the program, is planned to launch four astronauts in May 2024 on a free-return flyby of the Moon at a distance of .

After Artemis II, the Power and Propulsion Element of the Lunar Gateway and three components of an expendable lunar lander are planned to be delivered on multiple launches from commercial launch service providers.

Artemis III is planned to be the maiden flight of the SLS Block 1B and will use the minimalist Gateway and expendable lander to achieve the first crewed lunar landing of the program. The flight is planned to touch down on the lunar south pole region, with two astronauts staying there for about one week.

===Commercial space stations (planned)===
*Bigelow Commercial Space Station (USA): A Bigelow inflatable module was attached to the ISS on April 8, 2016, where it will remain for a testing period of two years. Any independent Bigelow Commercial space station will have to await the development of commercially available human rated orbital spacecraft. The first of these are expected to be the SpaceX Dragon 2 and the Boeing CST-100 Starliner in 2020.
*Orbital Technologies Commercial Space Station (Russia)

The Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) was part of the United States Air Force&#x27;s crewed spaceflight program, a successor to the canceled X-20 Dyna-Soar project. It was announced to the public on the same day that the Dyna-Soar program was canceled, 10 December 1963. the program was redirected in the mid-1960s and developed as a space station used for reconnaissance purposes. The space station used a spacecraft that was derived from NASA&#x27;s Gemini program. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before there were any crewed flights.

===Spiral program (Soviet Union, 1965 – late 1970s)===
In accordance with the quinquennial plan of the Soviet air forces, the Spiral program to develop a 2-stage launcher plane began in 1965 and was entrusted to OKB-155 A.I.Mikojan whose chief of the engineering and design department was Lozino Lozinsky (55 years). The project received the name of SPIRAL and was to prepare the Soviet Union for a war in space.

===TKS (Soviet Union, 1970–1991)===
The TKS spacecraft (Russian: Транспортный корабль снабжения, Transportnyi Korabl Snabzheniia, Transport Supply Spacecraft, GRAU index 11F72) was a Soviet spacecraft conceived in the late 1960s for resupply flights to the military Almaz space station. The spacecraft was designed for both crewed and autonomous uncrewed cargo resupply flights, but was never used operationally in its intended role – only four test missions were flown (including three that docked to Salyut space stations) during the program. The Functional Cargo Block (FGB) of the TKS spacecraft later formed the basis of several space station modules, including the Zarya FGB module on the International Space Station.

===Buran program (Soviet Union, 1976–1993)===
The Soviet Buran program was a reusable spaceplane project begun in 1976 at TsAGI as a response to the United States Space Shuttle program. It had only one orbital flight, an uncrewed test, before cancellation. In the process it became the first spaceplane to land autonomously.

===Saenger (Germany, 1985)===
The Saenger was a proposed two stage to orbit vehicle. Air-breathing hypersonic first stage and delta wing second stage. The German Hypersonics Program and its Saenger II reference vehicle received most of the domestic funding for spaceplane development in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1995, the project was discontinued primarily due to concerns of development costs and limited gains in price and performance compared to the existing space launch systems such as the Ariane 5 rocket.

===HOTOL (UK, 1986–1988)===
HOTOL, for Horizontal Take-Off and Landing, was a 1980s British design for a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) spaceplane that was to be powered by an airbreathing jet engine. Development was being conducted by a consortium led by Rolls-Royce and British Aerospace (BAe).

=== Ansari X Prize (World, 1996–2004) ===
The Ansari X Prize was a space competition in which the X Prize Foundation offered a US$10,000,000 prize for the first non-government organization to launch a reusable crewed spacecraft into space twice within two weeks. Twenty-six teams from around the world participated, ranging from volunteer hobbyists to large corporate-backed operations. Won by Scaled Composites&#x27; Tier One project. The other companies stopped work or as ARCA Space Corporation switched to other, more immediate purposes.

===Venturestar (USA, 1996–2001)===
VentureStar was a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch system proposed by Lockheed Martin and funded by the U.S. government. The goal was to replace the Space Shuttle by developing a reusable spaceplane that could launch satellites into orbit at a fraction of the cost.

===Fuji (Japan, 2001)===
Fuji (ふじ) was a crewed spacecraft of the space capsule kind, proposed by Japan&#x27;s National Space Development Agency (NASDA) Advanced Mission Research Center in December 2001. The Fuji design was ultimately not developed.

===Hopper (ESA, 2000)===
Hopper was a proposed European Space Agency orbital and reusable launch vehicle. The shuttle prototype spaceplane was one of several proposals for a European reusable launch vehicle (RLV) planned to cheaply ferry satellites into orbit by 2015. There have been no launches.

===Kliper (Russia, 2004–2007)===
Kliper (Russian: Клипер, Clipper) was a partly reusable crewed spacecraft concept, proposed in the early 2000s by RSC Energia. Due to lack of funding from the ESA and RSA, the project was indefinitely postponed by 2006.

===Project Constellation (USA, 2004–2010)===

Project Constellation, NASA&#x27;s intended successor to the Space Shuttle, is a program to develop new crafts and respective delivery systems for increased operation in space. It is primarily intended to facilitate missions for International Space Station resupply, lunar landing, etc.

The Constellation program was canceled in 2010 and replaced with the Artemis program based on the Space Launch System.

===XCOR Lynx (USA, 2008–2016)===

The XCOR Lynx is a suborbital horizontal-takeoff, horizontal-landing (HTHL),
rocket-powered spaceplane under development by the California-based company XCOR Aerospace to compete in the emerging suborbital spaceflight market. The Lynx is projected to carry one pilot, a ticketed passenger, and/or a payload above 100 km altitude. The Mark I test model will reach only ; the Mark II production model will be sub-orbital.

According to a September 2015 report, the first flight of the Lynx spaceplane was proposed to be in the second quarter of 2016 from Midland, Texas, but the company halted spaceplane development in May 2016 and refocused on its LOX/H2 engine technology.

Unilever&#x27;s Axe Apollo Space Academy marketing campaign which was launched in 2013 was also affected by the cancellation of the XCOR Lynx. The campaign included an astronaut selection contest where 23 winners would be given suborbital spaceflights on board the Lynx.

=== OPSEK (Russia, 2009–2017) ===

The Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex (abbreviated OPSEK) was a proposed third-generation modular space station in Low Earth orbit. OPSEK would initially consist of modules from the Russian Orbital Segment of the International Space Station (ISS) from 2024. It would then add new modules to it. It was canceled in 2017.
