<text>The Fraunhofer Society () is a German publicly-owned research organization with 76institutes spread throughout Germany, each focusing on different fields of applied science (as opposed to the Max Planck Society, which works primarily on basic science). With some 30,800 employees, mainly scientists and engineers, and with an annual research budget of about €3.0billion, it is the biggest organization for applied research and development services in Europe. It is named after Joseph von Fraunhofer who, as a scientist, an engineer, and an entrepreneur, is said to have superbly exemplified the goals of the society. 

Some basic funding for the Fraunhofer Society is provided by the state (the German public, through the federal government together with the states or &quot;Länder&quot;, &quot;owns&quot; the Fraunhofer Society), but more than 70% of the funding is earned through contract work, either for government-sponsored projects or from industry.

Since the 1990s the organization has also internationalized, establishing various centers in the United States, Asia and other European countries. In October 2010, Fraunhofer announced that it would open its first research center in South America. Fraunhofer UK Research Ltd was established as a legally independent affiliate along with its Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics, in Glasgow, Scotland, in March 2012.

== Fraunhofer model ==
The so-called &quot;Fraunhofer model&quot; has been in existence since 1973 and has led to the society&#x27;s continuing growth. Under the model, the Fraunhofer Society earns about 70% of its income through contracts with industry or specific government projects. The other 30% of the budget is sourced in the proportion 9:1 from federal and state (Land) government grants and is used to support preparatory research.

Thus the size of the society&#x27;s budget depends largely on its success in maximizing revenue from commissions. This funding model applies not just to the central society itself but also to the individual institutes. This serves both to drive the realization of the Fraunhofer Society&#x27;s strategic direction of becoming a leader in applied research and to encourage a flexible, autonomous, and entrepreneurial approach to the society&#x27;s research priorities.

The institutes are not legally independent units. The Fraunhofer model grants a very high degree of independence to the institutes in terms of project results, scientific impact and above all for their own funding. On the one hand, this results in a high degree of independence in terms of technical focus, distribution of resources, project acquisition, and project management. On the other hand, this also generates a certain economic pressure and a compulsion to customer and market orientation. In this sense, the institutes and their employees act in an entrepreneurial manner and ideally combine research, innovation, and entrepreneurship.

Numerous innovations are the result of research and development work at the Fraunhofer institutes. The institutes work on practically all application-relevant technology fields, i.e. microelectronics, information and communication technology, life sciences, materials research, energy technology or medical technology. One of the best known Fraunhofer developments is the MP3 audio data compression process. In 2018, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft reported 734 new inventions. This corresponds to about three inventions per working day. Of these, 612 developments were registered for patents. Recent studies have shown that the presence of a Fraunhofer center can boost the patent output of local firms and inventors in at least 13%.

==Notable projects==
*The MP3 compression algorithm was invented and patented by Fraunhofer IIS. Its license revenues generated about €100 million in revenue for the society in 2005.
*The Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute (HHI) was a significant contributor to the H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video compression standard, a technology recognized with two Emmy awards in 2008 and 2009. This includes the Fraunhofer FDK AAC library.
*As of May 2010, a metamorphic triple-junction solar cell developed by Fraunhofer&#x27;s Institute for Solar Energy Systems holds the world record for solar energy conversion efficiency with 41.1%, nearly twice that of a standard silicon-based cell.
*Fraunhofer is developing a program for use at IKEA stores, which would allow people to take a picture of their home into a store to view a fully assembled, digital adaptation of their room.
*E-puzzler, a pattern-recognition machine to digitally put back together even the most finely shredded papers. The E-puzzler uses a computerized conveyor belt that runs shards of shredded and torn paper through a digital scanner, automatically reconstructing original documents. It was hoped in 2013 that the machine would be able to reconstruct 16,000 bags of torn-up documents, but by 2014 only 23 bags had been reconstructed and the project stalled. In 2024 faster technology was being sought to prepare the vast number of fragments for scanning. 
*OpenIMS, an Open Source implementation of IMS Call Session Control Functions (CSCFs) and a lightweight Home Subscriber Server (HSS), which together form the core elements of all IMS/NGN architectures as specified today within 3GPP, 3GPP2, ETSI TISPAN and the PacketCable initiative.
*Roborder, an autonomous border surveillance system that uses unmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles which incorporate multi-modal sensors as part of an interoperable network.

==History==

The Fraunhofer Society was founded in Munich on March 26, 1949, by representatives of industry and academia, the government of Bavaria, and the nascent Federal Republic.

In 1952, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs declared the Fraunhofer Society to be the third part of the non-university German research landscape (alongside the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Max Planck Institutes). Whether the Fraunhofer Society should support applied research through its own facilities was, however, the subject of a long-running dispute.

From 1954, the Society&#x27;s first institutes developed. By 1956, it was developing research facilities in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense. In 1959, the Fraunhofer Society comprised nine institutes with 135 coworkers and a budget of 3.6 million Deutsche Mark.

In 1965, the Fraunhofer Society was identified as a sponsor organization for applied research. 

In 1968, the Fraunhofer Society became the target of public criticism for its role in military research. The criticism continued in the following decades and became a topic of public debate, including the need to improve resilience, defence capabilities and the protection of civilians and against cyber-attacks. In 2022, Fraunhofer also benefited from the € 100 billion in special funding for the German armed forces.

By 1969, Fraunhofer had more than 1,200 employees in 19 institutes. The budget stood at 33 million Deutsche Mark. At this time, a &quot;commission for the promotion of the development of the Fraunhofer Society&quot; planned the further development of the Fraunhofer Society (FhG). The commission developed a financing model that would make the Society dependent on its commercial success. This would later come to be known as the &quot;Fraunhofer Model&quot;.

The Model was agreed to by the Federal Cabinet and the Bund-Länder-Kommission in 1973. In the same year, the executive committee and central administration moved into joint accommodation at Leonrodstraße 54 in Munich.

The Fraunhofer program for the promotion of consulting research for SMEs was established, and has gained ever more significance in subsequent years.

In 1977, the political ownership of the society was shared by the Ministries of Defense and Research.

By 1984, the Fraunhofer Society had 3,500 employees in 33 institutes and a research budget of 360 million Deutsche Mark.

By 1988, defence research represented only about 10% of the entire expenditure of the Fraunhofer Society.

By 1989, the Fraunhofer Society had nearly 6,400 employees in 37 institutes, with a total budget of 700 million Deutsche Mark.

In 1991, the Fraunhofer Society faced the challenge of integrating numerous research establishments in former East Germany as branch offices of already-existing institutes in the Fraunhofer Society.

In 1993, the Fraunhofer Society&#x27;s total budget exceeded 1 billion Deutsche Mark.

In 1994, the Society founded a US-based subsidiary, Fraunhofer USA, Inc., to extend the outreach of Fraunhofer&#x27;s R&amp;D network to American clients.

Its mission statement of 2000 committed the Fraunhofer Society to being a market and customer-oriented, nationally and internationally active sponsor organization for institutes of applied research.

In 1999, Fraunhofer initiated Fraunhofer Venture, a technology transfer office, to advance the transfer of its scientific research findings and meet the growing entrepreneurial spirit in the Fraunhofer institutes.

Between 2000 and 2001, the institutes and IT research centres of the GMD (Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung – Society for Mathematics and Information technology) were integrated into the Fraunhofer Society at the initiative of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research.

The year 2000 marked a noteworthy success at Fraunhofer-Institut for Integrated Circuits (IIS): MP3, a lossy audio format which they developed. For many years afterwards, MP3 was the most widely adopted method for compressing and decompressing digital audio.

In 2002, ownership of the Heinrich-Hertz-Institut for Communications Technology Berlin GmbH (HHI), which belonged to the Gottfried William Leibniz Society e. V. (GWL), was transferred to the Fraunhofer Society. With this integration, the Fraunhofer Society budget exceeded €1 billion for the first time.

In 2003, the Fraunhofer Society headquarters moved to its own building in Munich.

The Fraunhofer Society developed and formulated a firm specific mission statement summarizing fundamental targets and codifying the desired &quot;values and guidelines&quot; of the society&#x27;s &quot;culture&quot;. Amongst these, the society committed itself to improving the opportunities for female employees and coworkers to identify themselves with the enterprise and to develop their own creative potential.

In 2004, the former &quot;Fraunhofer Working Group for Electronic Media Technology&quot; at the Fraunhofer-Institut for Integrated Circuits (IIS) gained the status of an independent institute. It becomes Fraunhofer-Institut for Digital Media Technology IDMT.

New alliances and topic groups helped to strengthen the market operational readiness level of the institutes for Fraunhofer in certain jurisdictions.

In 2005, two new institutes, the Leipzig Fraunhofer-Institut for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI), and the Fraunhofer Center for Nano-electronic technologies CNT in Dresden, were founded.

In 2006, the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS) was founded as a merger between the Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS), and the Institute for Media Communication (IMK).

In 2009, the former FGAN Institutes were converted into Fraunhofer Institutes, amongst them the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics FKIE and the Fraunhofer Institute for Radar and High Frequency Technology FHR.

In 2012, the cooperation of Fraunhofer with selected research-oriented universities of applied sciences based on the &quot;Application Center&quot; model started. The first cooperation was started with the Technische Hochschule OWL in Lemgo and led to the foundation of the Fraunhofer IOSB-INA in late 2011.

<doc id="197441" wikidata="Q846520" url="?curid=197441" title="I Against I">
<text>I Against I is the third studio album by American rock band Bad Brains. It was released on November 21, 1986 through SST Records with the catalog number SST 065. The best-selling album in the band&#x27;s catalog, &quot;I Against I&quot; finds the band branching out from their early hardcore punk style to touch on funk, soul, reggae and heavy metal. It is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The title track was a Paul Rachman-directed video (Rachman would go on to direct the documentary film &quot;American Hardcore&quot;).

The title &quot;I Against I&quot; presumably refers to the common Rastafarian phrase &quot;I and I&quot;, which is used in place of the first-person plural (i.e. &quot;we&quot;) to signify the union of the speaker, audience, and Jah (God) in love and peace.

At the producer&#x27;s suggestion, the vocals to &quot;Sacred Love&quot; were recorded over the phone from the prison where H.R. was serving time on a marijuana distribution 
charge.

==Legacy==
&quot;I Against I&quot; has influenced diverse rock artists. Ska punk band Sublime and its follow-up project, Sublime with Rome, frequently cover &quot;House of Suffering&quot; and bassist Eric Wilson said that &quot;I Against I&quot; inspired them to blend different genres. The Dillinger Escape Plan singer Greg Puciato named it one of the four albums that changed his life, as well as &quot;a critical step&quot; in shaping his vocal style. Max Cavalera of Sepultura states that the beginning of 1996 song &quot;Straighthate&quot; was probably inspired by &quot;I Against I&quot; since his band admired the Bad Brains. According to Harley Flanagan of the Cro-Mags, the verse riff in 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Quarrel&quot; was based on the last part of &quot;I Against I&quot;. Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine mentioned the album as one of his biggest influences. Danko Jones called the title track &quot;one of the greatest songs ever written as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot; Beppo of German punk band Spermbirds affirmed, &quot;&quot;I Against I&quot; had a huge impact on us, they taught us that you can also be hard by playing slow.&quot;

&quot;I Against I&quot; was covered by Jeff Buckley in 1992, BoySetsFire and Brother&#x27;s Keeper in 1999, and Lamb of God in 2018; &quot;House of Suffering&quot; has been covered by Sublime in 1995, Machine Head in 1999 and The Bled in 2005; &quot;Let Me Help&quot; was covered by Potshot in 2000; and &quot;Sacred Love&quot; was covered by Storm Large in 2014. In 2019, Bad Brains rerecorded the title track with rapper Denzel Curry as a guest vocalist for a Spotify single.

&quot;Re-Ignition&quot; has been sampled on &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; by Chubb Rock, &quot;Ice Man Cometh&quot; by 2 Black 2 Strong MMG, &quot;Ultrasonic Sound&quot; by Hive (which later appeared on &quot;The Matrix&quot; soundtrack), and on a remix of the 2004 song &quot;Roll Call&quot; by Lil Jon and Ice Cube. A live version of &quot;Re-Ignition&quot; was featured in &quot;Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock&quot;. &quot;Re-Ignition&quot; appeared on a 2019 episode of &quot;Black Lightning&quot;. The Canadian teen drama &quot;&quot;, which names each episode after a 1980s song, named an episode after the song &quot;I Against I&quot;.

<doc id="197445" wikidata="Q594359" url="?curid=197445" title="USS Georgia (BB-15)">
<text>USS &quot;Georgia&quot; (BB-15) was a United States Navy , the third of five ships of the class. She was built by the Bath Iron Works in Maine, with her keel laid in August 1901 and her launching in October 1904. The completed battleship was commissioned into the fleet in September 1906. The ship was armed with an offensive battery of four guns and eight guns, and she was capable of a top speed of .

&quot;Georgia&quot; spent the majority of her career in the Atlantic Fleet. In 1907, she took part in the Jamestown Exposition and suffered an explosion in her aft 8-inch gun turret that killed or wounded 21 men. At the end of the year, she joined the Great White Fleet on its circumnavigation of the globe, which ended in early 1909. Peacetime training followed for the next five years, and in 1914 she cruised in Mexican waters to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution. In early 1916, the ship was temporarily decommissioned.

When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the ship was tasked with training naval recruits for the expanding wartime fleet. Starting in September 1918, she was used as a convoy escort. Her only casualties during the war were due to disease, the result of poor conditions and severe overcrowding aboard the ship. &quot;Georgia&quot; was used to transport American soldiers back from France in 1918–1919, and the following year she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet, where she served as the flagship of the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron. The Washington Naval Treaty, signed in 1922, cut short the ship&#x27;s career, as it mandated severe draw-downs in naval strength. &quot;Georgia&quot; was accordingly sold for scrap in November 1923.

==Design==
Design work on the began in 1899, after the United States&#x27; victory in the Spanish–American War, which had demonstrated the need for sea-going battleships suitable for operations abroad, finally resolving the debate between proponents of that type and those who favored low-freeboard types useful for coastal defense. The designers included a superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns, which proved to be a significant disappointment in service, as firing either set of guns interfered with the others, slowing the rate of fire.

&quot;Georgia&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twenty-four coal-fired Niclausse boilers. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by cage masts in 1909. She had a crew of 812 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four /40 caliber Mark 4 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 guns and twelve /50 caliber guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets; two of these were superposed atop the main battery turrets, with the other two turrets abreast the forward funnel. The 6-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twelve 3-inch /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Georgia&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Georgia&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the machinery spaces and elsewhere. The faces of the main battery gun turrets (and the secondary turrets on top of them) were thick. Each turret rested on a supporting barbettes that had of armor plating. The conning tower had thick sides.

== Service history ==
===Early career and the Great White Fleet===
&quot;Georgia&quot; was laid down on 31 August 1901 at the Bath Iron Works in Maine. Her completed hull was launched on 11 October 1904, after which fitting-out work commenced. The ship was commissioned into the fleet on 24 September 1906. &quot;Georgia&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise after fitting-out work was completed, before joining the 2nd Division, 1 Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. She steamed out of Hampton Roads on 26 March 1907 to join the rest of the fleet in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; there, the ships conducted gunnery training. &quot;Georgia&quot; then steamed to the Boston Navy Yard for repairs before attending the Jamestown Exposition, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony. An international fleet that included British, French, German, Japanese, and Austro-Hungarian warships joined the US Navy at the event.

On 10 June, the ship took part in a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt. Two days later, she departed for target practice in Cape Cod Bay, arriving on 15 June. A propellant charge exploded in her aft 8-inch turret on 15 July, killing ten officers and men and wounding another eleven. Later that year, the ship took part in fleet maneuvers in the Atlantic, and on 24 September she went into dry dock at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an overhaul.

&quot;Georgia&quot; joined the Great White Fleet on 16 December 1907, when they departed Hampton Roads to begin their circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.

After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for Theodore Roosevelt.

===1910–1923===
Over the course of the following year and a half, &quot;Georgia&quot; conducted a peacetime routine of training maneuvers and gunnery drills. On 2 November 1910, she took part in a naval review for President William Howard Taft in preparation for a cruise to western Europe with the Atlantic Fleet. The ships stopped in France and Britain, and conducted extensive maneuvers while on the cruise. &quot;Georgia&quot; and the rest of the fleet arrived back in Guantanamo Bay on 13 March 1911. She returned to her peacetime training routine for the next two years. On 5 June 1913, she conducted a training cruise for midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy, followed by an overhaul in the Boston Navy Yard. In early January, she was deployed to Mexican waters to protect American interests in the country during the Mexican Revolution. She remained there from 14 January 1914 to March, when she returned to Norfolk briefly. The ship was back cruising off Mexico during the summer, and from August to October she operated in Haitian waters to protect Americans in the country, which was also experiencing internal unrest.

The ship then went into drydock for an overhaul, before returning to Cuban waters for maneuvers with the fleet. She arrived there on 25 February 1915. The rest of the year was spent with training exercises with the Atlantic Fleet. Another overhaul, at the Boston Navy Yard, from 20 January to January 1916. On 27 January, &quot;Georgia&quot; was decommissioned temporarily. The same day as the United States&#x27; declaration of war against Germany on 6 April 1917, the ship was reactivated for service during World War I. She was assigned to the 3rd Division, Battleship Force, based in the York River, Virginia. She spent most of the war training gunners for the rapidly expanding wartime Navy and conducting tactical training exercises. During this period, the ship frequently had more than a thousand men aboard the ship, despite the fact that she had sleeping accommodations for only 750. The ship&#x27;s commander at the time, Captain Sumner Kittelle, raised concerns about the over-crowded conditions aboard the ship.

From September 1918 to the end of the conflict, &quot;Georgia&quot; was assigned to the Cruiser Force Atlantic as a convoy escort. The ship&#x27;s first operation was with troop ship convoy 67, which departed New York on 23 September; the rest of the escort consisted of the armored cruisers and and the destroyer . &quot;Georgia&quot; had to take on of coal in addition to her normal stocks, which significantly degraded her seakeeping characteristics. The ship accordingly had to be battened down to reduce flooding from heavy seas, which had the effect of hastening the spread of disease. During the cruise, the crew suffered from 120 cases of influenza and 14 cases of pneumonia; 7 men died from disease. Even with the additional coal, the ship did not have sufficient fuel to reach the hand off point and she had to break off from the convoy to return to port. Germany signed an Armistice with the Allied powers, ending the war on 11 November. On 10 December, the ship was equipped to serve as a transport to carry American soldiers back from France. This duty saw the ship transferred to the Cruiser and Transport Force. She made five trips between December 1918 and June 1919, carrying almost 6,000 soldiers in total. The first trip, made in company with the battleship , arrived in Brest, France on 22 December 1918.

&quot;Georgia&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet shortly thereafter, departing from Boston on 16 July 1919. She transited the Panama Canal and arrived in San Diego, where she became the flagship of the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron. The ship went to the Mare Island Navy Yard for periodic maintenance on 20 September. The ship remained there until 15 July 1920 when she was decommissioned. Under the terms of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, the ship was sold for scrapping on 1 November 1923 and subsequently was broken up. The ship was formally stricken from the Navy Directory on 10 November. The ship&#x27;s bell and an eagle figurehead are preserved at the Reserve Officers Training Corps at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

<doc id="197446" wikidata="Q237560" url="?curid=197446" title="Barbara Boxer">
<text>Barbara Sue Boxer (née Levy; born November 11, 1940) is an American politician, lobbyist, and former reporter who served in the United States Senate, representing California from 1993 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the U.S. representative for California&#x27;s 6th congressional district from 1983 until 1993.

Born in Brooklyn, New York City, Boxer graduated from George W. Wingate High School and Brooklyn College. She worked as a stockbroker for several years before moving to California with her husband. During the 1970s, she worked as a journalist for the &quot;Pacific Sun&quot; and as an aide to U.S. Representative John L. Burton. She served on the Marin County Board of Supervisors for six years and became the board&#x27;s first female president. With the slogan &quot;Barbara Boxer Gives a Damn&quot;, she was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1982, representing California&#x27;s 6th district.

Boxer won the 1992 election for the U.S. Senate. Running for a third term in 2004, she received 6.96 million votes, becoming the first person to ever get more than 6 million votes in a Senate election and set a record for the most votes in any U.S. Senate election in history, until her colleague Dianne Feinstein, the senior senator from California, surpassed that number in her 2012 re-election. Boxer and Feinstein were the first female pair of U.S. senators representing any state at the same time. Boxer was the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the vice chair of the Select Committee on Ethics. She was also the Democratic chief deputy whip. Boxer is known for her liberal perspectives.

Boxer did not seek re-election in 2016. She was succeeded by then–California attorney general and future vice president Kamala Harris. In January 2020, Boxer joined Washington, D.C.–based lobbying firm Mercury Public Affairs as co-chairwoman. In January 2021, it was reported that Boxer was working as registered foreign agent for Hikvision, a Chinese state-sponsored surveillance company implicated in human rights abuses. After initially defending her work for Hikvision, Boxer reversed course and deregistered as a foreign agent. In October 2021, Boxer and others led a high-profile mass exodus of employees from Mercury&#x27;s California office to form their own public affairs and consulting company.

==Early life, family, and education==
Barbara Sue Levy was born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Sophie (née Silvershein) and Ira Levy, a Jewish couple. She attended public schools, graduating from George W. Wingate High School in 1958.

In 1962, she married Stewart Boxer and graduated from Brooklyn College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics. Barbara and Stewart Boxer moved to California in 1965.

==Early career==
Boxer worked as a stockbroker in the early 1960s while her husband went to law school. In 1968, after relocating to California, she worked on the presidential primary campaign of antiwar challenger Eugene McCarthy. In 1970, she co-founded the anti-Vietnam War Marin Alliance.

Boxer first ran for political office in 1972, when she challenged incumbent Republican Peter Arrigoni, a member of the Marin County Board of Supervisors, but lost a close election. From 1972 to 1974, Boxer worked as a reporter and editor for the &quot;Pacific Sun&quot;. She then managed the Marin campaign of John Burton, the brother of Phillip Burton, who then was the congressman representing southern San Francisco, California. John Burton intended to run against incumbent Republican District 6 Congressman William S. Mailliard from Belvedere, California. The district would be renumbered as the 5th District in January 1975. However, Mailliard resigned on March 5, 1974, so John Burton also ran in the special election to fill the remainder of the incumbent&#x27;s 6th District term. Burton narrowly won both crowded races and was sworn into office in 1974, and Boxer became his staff aide.

In 1976, Boxer was elected to the Marin County Board of Supervisors, serving for six years. She was the board&#x27;s first female president.

==U.S. representative==

Boxer, then a Marin County supervisor, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1982, succeeding John Burton. Her slogan was &quot;Barbara Boxer Gives a Damn&quot;. In the House, she represented for five terms. She narrowly won her first election with 52 percent of the vote, but easily won re-election in her subsequent races.

Boxer was a member of the original Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families that was established in 1983. She sat on the Armed Services committee throughout her tenure in the House.

In 1992, Boxer was implicated in the House banking scandal, which revealed that more than 450 congressional representatives and aides, herself included, wrote overdraft checks covered by the House Bank&#x27;s overdraft protection. In a statement, Boxer said, &quot;In painful retrospect, I clearly should have paid more attention to my account&quot;. She wrote a $15 check to the Deficit Reduction Fund for each of her 87 overdrafts.

In 1991, during the Anita Hill Senate hearings, where Hill accused U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, Boxer led a group of women House members to the Senate Judiciary Committee, demanding that the all-white, all-male Committee of Senators take Hill&#x27;s charges seriously.

==U.S. senator==

===Elections===
Four-term incumbent Democratic Senator Alan Cranston did not seek re-election in 1992. Boxer opted to run for Senate. In what was billed as the &quot;Year of the Woman&quot;, Boxer beat fellow Rep. Mel Levine and Lieutenant Governor Leo McCarthy in the Democratic primary, winning 44% of the vote. In the general election, Boxer defeated Republican Bruce Herschensohn by 4.9%. A last-minute revelation that Herschensohn had patronized a strip club at least partially affected the outcome. In 1998, Boxer won a second term, beating sitting California State Treasurer Matt Fong by 10.1% of the vote. In 2004, after facing no primary opposition, Boxer defeated GOP candidate Bill Jones, the former California Secretary of State, by 20%. In 2010, Boxer defeated Republican candidate Carly Fiorina, former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, by 10%. Boxer did not seek re-election in 2016.

==Presidential politics==

===2004===

On January 6, 2005, Boxer joined Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-Ohio) in filing a U.S. congressional objection to the certification of Ohio&#x27;s Electoral College votes in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. She called the objection her &quot;opening shot to be able to focus the light of truth on these terrible problems in the electoral system&quot;. The Senate voted the objection down 74–1; the House voted the objection down 267–31. It was only the second congressional objection to an entire state&#x27;s electoral delegation in U.S. history; the first instance was in 1877.

===2008===
As a superdelegate, Boxer had declared that she would support the winner of the California primary, which was won by Hillary Clinton. However, she reneged on that pledge and remained neutral, only officially backing Barack Obama&#x27;s candidacy the day after the last primaries, once he had garnered enough delegate votes to clinch the nomination.

===2016===
Prior to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s announcement, on October 20, 2013, Senator Boxer was one of sixteen Democratic female senators to sign a letter endorsing Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

==Post-Senate career==

After leaving the U.S. Senate, Boxer has given paid speeches; raised money for her political action committee (PAC for Change); hosted a weekly podcast with her daughter, Nicole Boxer; and worked as a lobbyist.

In April 2017, Boxer served as the keynote speaker for the Environmental Student Assembly&#x27;s Earth Month at the University of Southern California.

===Lobbying===

In January 2020, it was reported that Boxer had become co-chair of Mercury Public Affairs, a prominent lobbying and public affairs firm, whose corporate clients have included Airbnb and AT&amp;T, along foreign governments such as Qatar and Turkey.

Prior to joining Mercury Public Affairs, Boxer had worked as a paid advisor to Lyft, during which time she advocated against the passage of AB-5, a California law that Lyft opposed which reclassified as &quot;employees&quot; many workers, including Lyft drivers, who had previously been classified as &quot;independent contractors&quot; under state labor law.

Boxer also has worked as a paid consultant on behalf of Poseidon Water as part of that company&#x27;s effort to install a desalination plant in Huntington Beach, California, and also for CityLift Parking, a company in Oakland, California, that designs automated parking lifts.

In October 2021, Boxer, former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and former California State Assembly speaker Fabian Nunez led a high-profile mass exodus of employees from the California office of Mercury Public Affairs to set up their own public affairs and consulting firm. At the time of their departure, the press reported Mercury&#x27;s California based clients included Clorox, Lyft, the California Charter Schools Association, and the Westlands Water District, the utility that oversees the heart of the state&#x27;s agricultural lands in the Central Valley.

===Foreign agent===
On January 12, 2021, it was reported that the inaugural committee of president-elect Joe Biden returned a $500 donation from Boxer after Boxer registered as a foreign agent on behalf of Hikvision, a Chinese state-owned manufacturer of surveillance equipment. The company has been accused of involvement in the persecution of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region. In an emailed statement to the press regarding the returned donation, Boxer defended her work as a registered foreign agent by saying, &quot;When I am asked to provide strategic advice to help a company operate in a more responsible and humane manner consistent with U.S. law in spirit and letter, it is an opportunity to make things better while helping protect and create American jobs.&quot;

Later that same day, Boxer reversed course and publicly announced on Twitter that she would deregister as a foreign agent for Hikvision, writing, &quot;Due to the intense response to my registration I have determined that my continued work has become a negative distraction from my effort to preserve American jobs and make the company better. Therefore I have deregistered.&quot;

==Platform and votes==
Boxer has been described as a &quot;liberal lion&quot;, as well as a &quot;progressive force&quot;.

===George W. Bush===
Boxer and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin were the only two Senate Democrats to support Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold&#x27;s 2006 resolution to censure President George W. Bush.

====Bush nominees====
During the confirmation hearings for the United States secretary of state nominee Condoleezza Rice in January 2005, Boxer challenged her to admit to alleged mistakes and false statements made by the Bush administration in leading the United States into the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Along with 12 other senators, Boxer voted against confirmation. The 12 &quot;no&quot; votes were the most votes against a secretary of state nominee since 1825, when Henry Clay was so named.

Boxer voted against John Bolton&#x27;s nomination for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and filibustered him on the Senate floor. Because of the strong Democratic opposition, Bolton could not obtain Senate approval. However, President Bush bypassed the Senate by employing the constitutional right of recess appointment.

Boxer voted against the confirmation of Chief Justice of the United States nominee John Roberts and against the confirmation of Associate Justice nominee Samuel Alito.

===Economy===
On October 1, 2008, Boxer voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.

On August 26, 2013, Boxer told &quot;The Ed Show&quot; on MSNBC that the federal minimum wage should be raised to $10.00 an hour.

===Education===
Boxer established the Excellence in Education award to recognize teachers, parents, businesses and organizations working to make positive changes in education. Beginning in 1997, Boxer presented the Excellence in Education Award to 38 recipients.

===Election and Electoral College reform===
Boxer voted for the 2002 Help America Vote Act, which mandated the use of voting machines across the country, among other provisions. On February 18, 2005, Boxer and others introduced the Count Every Vote Act of 2005, which would have provided a voter-verified paper ballot for every vote cast in electronic voting machines and ensured access to voter verification for all citizens. The bill did not pass.

Boxer introduced a bill on November 15, 2016, calling for a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and to select future presidents by a simple national vote only. This bill was introduced six days after Donald Trump won the 2016 election despite losing the national popular vote to Hillary Clinton.

=== Energy ===
Boxer opposed the nuclear energy deal between the United States and India. She believed that India should not receive aid from the U.S. in the civilian nuclear energy sector until it broke its relationship with Iran.

===Environment===
Boxer successfully led the 2003 Senate floor battle to block oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In 2005, Boxer voted again to block oil drilling at ANWR.

Boxer introduced the National Oceans Protection Act (NOPA) of 2005.

Boxer was an original cosponsor of Senator Jim Jeffords&#x27; (I-VT) Clean Power Act.

Boxer was the Senate sponsor of the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 17, 2006. The bill protected of federal land as wilderness and of stream as a wild and scenic river, including such popular areas as the King Range and Cache Creek.

Boxer, along with her colleague Dianne Feinstein, voted in favor of subsidy payments to conventional commodity farm producers at the cost of subsidies for conservation-oriented farming.

===Foreign policy===
In 1997, the Senate passed a Boxer resolution calling on the United States not to recognize the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan because of its human rights abuses against women.

She voted against the first Gulf War while a member of the House in 1991.

In 2012, Boxer and a bipartisan group of six senators introduced a resolution condemning Russia for aiding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government as the country faced civil war.

====Iraq War====
In October 2002, Boxer voted against the joint resolution passed by the US Congress to authorize the use of military force by the Bush administration against Iraq.

In June 2005, Senators Boxer and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, cosponsored Senate Resolution 171 calling for a timeframe for US troop withdrawal from Iraq.

In 2005, Boxer criticized Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#x27;s judgment in relation to the war in Iraq: &quot;I personally believe – this is my personal view – that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.&quot;

Boxer was sharply critical of US Army General David Petraeus&#x27; testimony regarding the political and military situation of Iraq in 2007, charging him with reporting while wearing &quot;rosy glasses&quot;.

In January 2007, Boxer was in the news for comments she made when responding to Bush&#x27;s plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. &quot;Who pays the price?&quot; Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You&#x27;re not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you.&quot; When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, &quot;Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel terrible about it. That&#x27;s not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we&#x27;re going to pay militarily... I find really appalling.&quot;

===Gun laws===
Senator Boxer joined colleagues to pass a federal ban on various semi-automatic firearms and established the COPS program.

In the wake of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Boxer posted on Facebook that it was an &quot;unspeakable tragedy&quot; and she encouraged others to support &quot;common-sense gun safety laws to protect our communities from these weapons of war.&quot;

===Hate crimes===
Boxer co-sponsored the Matthew Shepard Act, which expanded the federal definition of hate crimes to include crimes based on the victim&#x27;s sexual orientation and gender identity.

===Health care===

Boxer was part of a coalition to increase medical research to find cures for diseases. In 2007, she authored successful bipartisan legislation with Senator Gordon Smith to combat HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis globally. In 1997, she authored a Patients&#x27; Bill of Rights. She has written a bill to make health insurance tax-deductible and a bill to allow any American buy into the same health insurance program that members of Congress have. She supported comprehensive prescription drug coverage through Medicare and the right of all consumers to purchase lower-cost prescription drugs re-imported from Canada.

In October 2002, Boxer urged the Bush administration to take specific steps to address the causes of the steep increase in autism cases in California.

Boxer advocated for embryonic stem-cell research, asserting that it has the potential to help those with diabetes, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, spinal cord injuries, and other diseases.

===Intellectual property===

Boxer supported PIPA.

===LGBT rights===
In 1996, Boxer was one of 14 senators to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act. She also voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004 and 2006, although when San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom issued a directive to the city-county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, she stated that she supported California&#x27;s domestic partnership law but believed that marriage was between a man and a woman. She opposed Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that prohibited same-sex marriage in California, and supported the Uniting American Families Act.

During her 2010 campaign, Boxer stated her strong support for same-sex marriage.

===Marijuana===
Boxer opposed reforming marijuana policy and opposed a California ballot measure to legalize and tax marijuana for those 21 and older in the state.

===Reproductive rights===

As a senator, Boxer was an outspoken supporter of abortion rights. She authored the Freedom of Choice Act of 2004 and participated in the floor fight for passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

Boxer was critical of the Stupak-Pitts Amendment to Obamacare.

===Social Security===
Boxer supported the then-current system of Social Security, and opposed President George W. Bush&#x27;s plan for partial privatization of Social Security.

===Surveillance===
In June 2008, Boxer spoke in the Senate in opposition to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, a pending bill in the United States Congress to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and later broke with her counterpart Dianne Feinstein and voted against it.

==Public image==
At 4&#x27;11&quot; (150 cm), Boxer was one of the shortest members of the Congress. When addressing the chamber, she would sometimes stand on a portable platform, dubbed the &quot;Boxer Box&quot;, which was carried by an aide.

===Television appearances===
Boxer has made cameo appearances as herself in several television shows, including &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; (1994), &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (2002) and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; (2007), as well as a cameo (as herself) in the 2000 film &quot;Traffic&quot;. On November 2, 2005, she made an appearance on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; to discuss her new novel, &quot;A Time To Run&quot;.

In September 2012, it was reported that Boxer and Republican Senator Olympia Snowe would appear together in an NBC sitcom.

Boxer later returned to &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; alongside several other U.S. senators in early 2015 in the seventh season episode &quot;Ms. Ludgate-Dwyer Goes to Washington&quot;.

In November 2016, Boxer appeared in an episode of &quot;Chelsea&quot;, presented by Chelsea Handler, entitled &quot;Do Not Despair About Our Country&quot;, filmed shortly after the result of the 2016 US presidential election was known, during which Handler wept about the result.

<text>Goa trance is an electronic dance music style that originated in the early 1990s in the Indian state of Goa. Goa trance often has drone-like basslines, similar to the techno minimalism of 21st century psychedelic trance (psytrance). Psychedelic trance developed from Goa trance. The typically long songs built on progressive beat changes are said to put the listener in a “trance”.

==History==
The music has its roots in the popularity of Goa, India as a hippie capital in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Throughout the 1980s, music incorporating elements of industrial music, new beat and electronic body music (EBM), with the spiritual culture in India were commonplace, although Goa trance did not appear as a style until the early 1990s.

The music played was a blend of styles loosely defined as techno, new beat and various genres of &quot;computer music&quot; (e.g., high energy disco without vocals, acid-house, electro, industrial-gothic, various styles of house and electronic-rock hybrids). It arrived on tape cassettes by traveller-collectors and DJs and was shared (copied) tape-to-tape among Goa DJs, in an underground scene not driven by labels or the music industry.

Prior to the 1980s, the music played at parties was performed by live bands and tapes were played in between sets. In the early 1980s, sampling synth and MIDI music appeared globally and DJs became the preferred format in Goa, with two tape decks driving a party without a break, facilitating continuous music.

Cassette tapes were used by DJs until the 1990s, when DAT tapes were used. DJs playing in Goa during the 1980s included Fred Disko, Dr Bobby, Stephano, Paulino, Mackie, Babu, Laurent, Ray, Fred, Antaro, Lui, Rolf, Tilo, Pauli, Rudi, and Goa Gil. The music was eclectic in style but based around instrumental dub versions of tracks that evoked mystical, cosmic, psychedelic, and existential themes. Special mixes were made by DJs in Goa that were the editing of various versions of a track to make it longer.

By 1990–91, Goa had become a hot destination for partying and was no longer under the radar: the scene grew bigger. Goa-style parties spread like a diaspora all over the world from 1993, and a multitude of labels in various countries (UK, Australia, Japan, Germany) dedicated themselves to promoting psychedelic electronic music that reflected the ethos of Goa parties, Goa music and Goa-specific artists and producers and DJs. Mark Maurice&#x27;s &#x27;Panjaea&#x27;s focal point&#x27; parties brought it to London in 1992 and its programming at London club megatripolis gave a great boost to the small international scene that was then growing (October 21, 1993 onwards). The golden age and first wave of Goa trance was generally agreed upon aesthetically between 1994 and 1997.

Goa trance in the music industry and as a collective party fashion did not gain global recognition until 1994, when Paul Oakenfold began to champion the genre via his own Perfecto label and in the media, most notably with the release of his 1994 &quot;Essential Mix&quot;, or more commonly known as the &quot;Goa Mix&quot;.

==Sound==
The original goal of the music was to assist the dancers in experiencing a collective state of bodily transcendence, similar to that of ancient shamanic dancing rituals, through hypnotic, pulsing melodies and rhythms. As such, goa trance has an energetic beat, often in a standard 4/4 dance rhythm. A typical track will generally build up to a much more energetic movement in the second half before reaching an intense climax, then taper off fairly quickly toward the end. The tempo typically lies in the 130–150 BPM range, although some tracks may have a tempo as low as 110 or as high as 160 BPM. Generally 8–12 minutes long, Goa trance tracks tend to focus on steadily building energy throughout, using changes in percussion patterns and more intricate and layered synth parts as the music progresses in order to build a hypnotic and intense feel.

The kick drum often is a low, thick sound with prominent sub-bass frequencies. The music very often incorporates many audio effects that are often created through experimentation with synthesisers. A well-known sound that originated with Goa trance and became much more prevalent through its successor, which evolved Goa trance into a music genre known as psytrance, has the organic &quot;squelchy&quot; sound (usually a sawtooth-wave which is run through a resonant band-pass or high-pass filter).

Other music technology used in Goa trance includes popular analogue synthesizers such as the Roland TB-303, Roland Juno-60/106, Novation Bass-Station, Korg MS-10, and the Roland SH-101. Hardware samplers manufactured by Akai, Yamaha and Ensoniq were also popular for sample playback and manipulation.

A popular element of Goa trance is the use of vocal samples, often from science fiction movies. Those samples mostly contain references to drugs, parapsychology, extraterrestrial life, existentialism, out-of-body experiences, dreams, science, time travel, spirituality and similarly mysterious and unconventional topics.

Detroit techno was introduced in 1999 by a group of anonymous artists who performed exclusively Detroit techno and Chicago house at a venue known as Laughing Buddha (formally known as Klinsons) in Baga, Goa. They were the first to play this style of music with turntables. Using vinyl was a first for Goa at that time. Until then DJs usually used mini discs, DATs and CDs, without beat matching to mix. The introduction of the Detroit sound had a lasting effect on Goa trance, leading to a more industrialized sound.

==Parties==

The first parties were those held at Bamboo Forest at South Anjuna beach, Disco Valley at Vagator beach and Arambol beach (c. 1991–1993) and attempts initially were made to turn them into commercial events, which met with much resistance and the need to pay the local Goan police &quot;baksheesh&quot;. Events were generally staged around a bar, even though these were often only a temporary fixture in the forest or beach. The parties taking place around the new year tend to be the most chaotic with busloads of people coming in from all places such as Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Chennai. Travelers and &quot;sadhus&quot; from all over India passed by to join in.

Megatripolis in London was a great influence in popularising the sound. Running from June 1993 though really programming the music from October 1993 when it moved to Heaven nightclub it made all the national UK press, running until October 1996.

In 1993 a party organization called Return to the Source also brought the sound to London, UK. Starting life at the Rocket in North London with a few hundred followers, the Source went on to a long residency at Brixton&#x27;s 2,000 capacity Fridge and to host several larger 6,000 capacity parties in Brixton Academy, their New Year&#x27;s Eve parties gaining reputations for being very special. The club toured across the UK, Europe and Israel throughout the 1990s and went as far as two memorable parties on the slopes of Mount Fuji in Japan and New York&#x27;s Liberty Science Center. By 2001 the partners Chris Deckker, Mark Allen, Phil Ross and Janice Duncan were worn out and all but gone their separate ways. The last Return to the Source party was at Brixton Academy in 2002.

Goa parties have a definitive visual aspect – the use of &quot;fluoro&quot; (fluorescent paint) is common on clothing and on decorations such as tapestries. The graphics on these decorations are usually associated with topics such as aliens, Hinduism, other religious (especially eastern) images, mushrooms (and other psychedelic art), shamanism and technology. Shrines in front of the DJ stands featuring religious items are also common decorations.

==In popular culture==
For a short period in the mid-1990s, Goa trance enjoyed significant commercial success with support from DJs, who later went on to assist in developing a much more mainstream style of trance outside Goa.

<text>The goa (Procapra picticaudata), also known as the Tibetan gazelle, is a species of antelope that inhabits the Tibetan plateau.

==Description==
The goa is a relatively small antelope, with slender and graceful bodies. Both males and females stand tall at the shoulder, measure in head-body length and weigh . Males have long, tapering, ridged horns, reaching lengths of . The horns are positioned close together on the forehead, and rise more or less vertically until they suddenly diverge towards the tips. Females have no horns, and neither sex has distinct facial markings.

The goa is grayish brown over most of its body, with its summer coat being noticeably greyer in colour than its winter one. It has a short, black-tipped tail in the center of its heart-shaped white rump patches. Its fur lacks an undercoat, consisting of long guard hairs only, and is notably thicker in winter. It appears to have excellent senses, including keen eyesight and hearing. Its thin and long legs enhance its running skills, which are required to escape from predators.

==Distribution and habitat==
The goa is native to the Tibetan plateau, and is widespread throughout the region, inhabiting terrain between in elevation. It is almost restricted to the Chinese provinces of Gansu, Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, and Sichuan, with tiny populations in the Ladakh and Sikkim regions of India. No distinct subspecies of goa have been reported.

Alpine meadow and high elevation steppe are the primary habitats of the goa. It is scattered widely across its range, being present in numerous small herds spread wide apart; estimates of population density vary from 2.8 individuals per sq km to less than 0.1, depending on the local environment.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Unlike some other ungulates, goas do not form large herds, and are typically found in small family groups. Although they occasionally gather into larger aggregations, most goa groups contain no more than 10 individuals, and many are solitary. They have been noted to give short cries and calls to alert the herd on approach of a predator or other perceived threat.

Goas feed on a range of local vegetation, primarily forbs and legumes, supplemented by relatively small amounts of grasses and sedges. Their main local predators are the Himalayan wolf and the snow leopard.

==Reproduction==
For much of the year, the sexes remain separate, with the females grazing in higher altitude terrain than the males. The females descend from their high pastures around September, prior to the mating season in December. During the rut, the males are largely solitary, scent marking their territories and sometimes butting or wrestling rival males with their horns.

Gestation lasts around six months, with the single young being born between July and August. The infants remain hidden with their mother for the first two weeks of life, before rejoining the herd. The age of sexual maturity in goas is unknown, but is probably around 18 months. Goas have lived for up to five years and seven months in captivity.

==Conservation status==

Although goa populations have declined over recent years, they do not inhabit regions of high human population over most of their range, and do not significantly compete with local livestock. Because of their small size, they are not popular targets for hunting, and they are classified as a class II protected species in China. The primary threats to the goa in China are loss of habitat, due to encroachment on their natural ranges by pastoralists and the expansion of agriculture in the western provinces.

In Ladakh, they live at high altitudes (4,750-5,050 m or 15,580-16,570 ft), but prefer relatively flat areas with an affinity for warmer, south-facing slopes. They coexist with domestic yaks and kiang, but are competitive with domestic goats and sheep and avoid herders and their dogs. The population in Ladakh, less than 100 individuals, continues to decline. Within Ladakh, its distribution was spread as far west as the Tsokar Basin in the beginning of the 20th century, but today is confined to the Hanle Valley and the neighbouring areas, such as Chumur. Presently gazelles are suffering not only from poor pasture conditions, but also from problems associated with small populations such as lack of genetic diversity in the population, which makes them less resistant to diseases.

Goa populations in both Ladakh and Tibet seem to be declining precipitously and are threatened with extinction, at least in some regions. A small population also exists in northern Sikkim, right at the border between India and Chinese-controlled territories, apparently moving back and forth between the countries.

<doc id="197464" wikidata="Q6692851" url="?curid=197464" title="Low End Theory">
<text>Low End Theory was a weekly experimental hip hop and electronic music club night that took place every Wednesday from 2006 to 2018 at The Airliner in Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles, California.

==History==
Low End Theory was founded in 2006 by producer and Alpha Pup Records label head Daddy Kev and Project Blowdian All City Jimmy, formerly known as Nocando. The weekly event was named after The Low End Theory, the second studio album by American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest. As the &quot;epicenter&quot; of L.A.&#x27;s instrumental hip hop scene, Low End Theory has become one of the most influential venues for the &#x27;beat music&#x27; genre. Long-time resident DJs include Daddy Kev, The Gaslamp Killer, Nobody, and D-Styles.

&quot;L.A.&#x27;s monolithic weekly showcase for uncut beat-driven tracks&quot; has been a launchpad for the success of prolific electronic artists such as The Glitch Mob, Daedelus, Nosaj Thing and Flying Lotus, who describes the club&#x27;s humble beginnings as a sort of &quot;producer&#x27;s lounge&quot;. The club night &quot;showcases the links between classic Los Angeles rap and the fractured jazz of Eric Dolphy but also demonstrates how artists are using dazzling instrument technologies to upend both of those traditions&quot;.

Low End Theory has garnered much attention after multiple performances by Thom Yorke, who played for the normal price of ten dollars. &quot;If tickets were left to auction online, they&#x27;d bring in enough to fund a state Senate campaign&quot;.

In 2014, The First Low End Theory Festival was Held at the Echoplex in Los Angeles. The First Festivals Lineup Included The Internet, Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Nosaj Thing, Baths, Daedelus, Teebs, Jonwayne, Knxwledge, Shlohmo, Ras G, Dntel, Dibiase, Mono/Poly, House Shoes, Kamasi Washington, Anderson Paak, Matthewdavid, Elos, Astronautica, and milo along with residents Daddy Kev, Dj Nobody, D Styles, Gaslamp Killer, and Nocando.

The monthly Low End Theory Podcast began in 2009 and features mixes from a resident DJ and one guest DJ. Since its inception, Low End Theory has expanded to Japan, San Francisco, New York City, and Europe, performing quarterly in Japan and every now and again in the latter three.

== Closure ==
The final Low End Theory show occurred on August 8, 2018, with a lineup featuring Tyler, the Creator, TOKiMONSTA, The Glitch Mob, Taylor McFerrin, Tsuruda, and Jake Jenkins.

<doc id="197469" wikidata="Q457864" url="?curid=197469" title="Friz Freleng">
<text>Isadore &quot;Friz&quot; Freleng (; August 21, 1905May 26, 1995), credited as I. Freleng early in his career, was an American animator, cartoonist, director, producer, and composer known for his work at Warner Bros. Cartoons on the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons from the 1930s to the early 1960s. In total he created more than 300 cartoons.

He introduced and/or developed several of the studio&#x27;s biggest stars, including Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Tweety, Sylvester, Yosemite Sam (to whom he was said to bear more than a passing resemblance), Granny, and Speedy Gonzales. The senior director at Warners&#x27; Termite Terrace studio, Freleng directed more cartoons than any other director in the studio (a total of 266), and is also the most officially-honored of the Warner directors, having won five Academy Awards and three Emmy Awards. After Warner closed down the animation studio in 1963, Freleng and business partner David H. DePatie founded DePatie–Freleng Enterprises, which produced cartoons (including &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;), feature film title sequences, and Saturday-morning cartoons through the early 1980s.

The nickname &quot;Friz&quot; came from his friend, Hugh Harman, who initially nicknamed him &quot;Congressman Frizby&quot; after a fictional senator who appeared in satirical pieces in the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, due to the character&#x27;s strong resemblance to him. Over time, this shortened to &quot;Friz&quot;.

William Schallert claimed that Freleng was the model for Mr. Magoo due to his physical appearance.

== Early career ==

Freleng was born to Louis Mendel Freleng, a Polish Jewish immigrant from Kutno, and Elka (née Ribakoff) Freleng, a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant from Odesa Oblast, in Kansas City, Missouri, where he attended Westport High School from 1919 to 1923 and where began his career in animation at the United Film Ad Service. There, he made the acquaintance of fellow animators Hugh Harman and Ub Iwerks. In 1923, Iwerks&#x27; friend, Walt Disney, moved to Hollywood and put out a call for his Kansas City colleagues to join him. Freleng, however, held out until January 1927, when he finally moved to California and joined the Walt Disney studio. He worked alongside other former Kansas City animators, including Iwerks, Harman, Carman Maxwell, and Rudolf Ising. While at Disney, Freleng worked on the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons for producers Margaret Winkler and Charles Mintz. Friz said in an interview with Michael Barrier that Walt had shown patience and remorse in letters prior to joining him, but did not show that attitude after he joined Disney and instead Disney became abusive and harassed him. In 1928, Freleng left the studio, due to Disney saying he &quot;forfeited his bonus&quot; along with comments on his animation mistakes. Freleng moved back to Kansas to work at his old job at the United Film Ad Service.

Freleng soon teamed up with Harman and Ising (who had also left Disney&#x27;s employ) to create their own studio. The trio produced a pilot film starring a new Mickey Mouse-like character named Bosko. Looking at unemployment if the cartoon failed to generate interest, Freleng moved to New York City to work on Mintz&#x27;s Krazy Kat cartoons, all the while still trying to sell the Harman-Ising Bosko picture. Freleng was very unhappy living in New York and made the best of it until another opportunity opened for him. Bosko was finally sold to Leon Schlesinger, who would produce the series for Warner Bros. At first, Freleng was reluctant to return to California when Harman-Ising asked him to work on the series. At the insistence of his sister Jean, Freleng soon moved back to California to work on the Bosko series, ultimately released under the title &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;. A prominent animator on the series, Freleng was eventually delegated co-directorial duties on shorts such as &quot;Bosko&#x27;s Picture Show&quot;.

== Freleng as director ==
=== Early Schlesinger cartoons ===
Harman and Ising (alongside their crew of animators) left Schlesinger&#x27;s employ over disputes about budgets in 1933. Schlesinger was left with no experienced directors and therefore lured Freleng away from Harman-Ising to successfully fix cartoons directed by Tom Palmer which Warner had rejected. The young animator rapidly became Schlesinger&#x27;s top director, helming the majority of the higher-budgeted &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts during the mid-1930s, and he introduced the studio&#x27;s first true post-Bosko star, Porky Pig, in the film, &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Got a Hat&quot; (1935). Porky was a distinctive character, unlike Bosko or his replacement, Buddy.

As a director, Freleng gained the reputation of a tough taskmaster. His unit, however, consistently produced high-quality animated shorts under his direction.

Friz Freleng directed the largest number of cartoons on the Censored Eleven, a group of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons originally produced and released by Warner Bros. that were withheld from syndication in the United States by United Artists (UA) in 1968 because the use of ethnic stereotypes in the cartoons, specifically African stereotypes, was deemed too offensive for contemporary audiences.

David DePatie, when asked about the Japanese beetle in Blue Racer in 1996, said this about Friz&#x27;s view on race, &quot;It seems like poking fun at certain ethnic groups had always spelled success. Friz had always felt that way in his cartoons, especially with Speedy.&quot;

=== Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ===
In September 1937, Freleng left Schlesinger after accepting an increase in salary to direct for the new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio headed by Fred Quimby. Freleng served as a director on &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot;, an animated series adapted from the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;). In November 1938, Freleng became a &quot;junior director&quot; under Hugh Harman but quit after 6 months in April 1939.

=== Back with Schlesinger and Warner Bros. ===
Freleng happily returned to Warner Bros. in mid-April 1939 when his MGM contract ended. One of the first &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon shorts directed by Freleng during his second tenure at the studio was &quot;You Ought to Be in Pictures&quot;, a cartoon short which blended animation with live-action footage of the Warner Bros. studio (and included staff such as story man Michael Maltese and Schlesinger himself). The plot, which centers around Porky Pig being tricked by Daffy Duck into terminating his contract with Schlesinger to attempt a career in features, echoes Freleng&#x27;s experience in moving to MGM.

=== Directorial achievements ===

Schlesinger&#x27;s hands-off attitude toward his animators allowed Freleng and his fellow directors almost complete creative control and room to experiment with cartoon comedy styles, which allowed the studio to keep pace with the Disney studio&#x27;s technical superiority. Freleng&#x27;s style quickly matured, and he became a master of comic timing. Often working alongside layout artist Hawley Pratt, he also introduced or redesigned a number of Warner characters, including Yosemite Sam in 1945, the cat-and-bird duo Sylvester and Tweety in 1947, and Speedy Gonzales in 1955.

Freleng and Chuck Jones would dominate the Warner Bros. studio in the years after World War II, with Freleng largely concentrating on the above-mentioned characters, as well as Bugs Bunny. Freleng continued to produce modernized versions of the musical comedies he animated in his early career, such as &quot;Three Little Bops&quot; (1957) and &quot;Pizzicato Pussycat&quot; (1955). He won four Oscars during his time at Warner Bros., for the films &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot; (1947), &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot; (1955), &quot;Birds Anonymous&quot; (1957) and &quot;Knighty Knight Bugs&quot; (1958). Other Freleng cartoons, such as &quot;Sandy Claws&quot; (1955), &quot;Mexicali Shmoes&quot; (1959), &quot;Mouse and Garden&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Pied Piper of Guadalupe&quot; (1961) were Oscar nominees.

Freleng&#x27;s cartoon, &quot;Show Biz Bugs&quot; (1957), with Daffy Duck vying with Bugs Bunny for theatre audience appreciation, was arguably a template for the successful format of &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; that premiered on television in the autumn of 1960. Further, Freleng directed the cartoons with the erudite and ever-so-polite Goofy Gophers encountering the relentless wheels of human industry, them being &quot;I Gopher You&quot; (1954) and &quot;Lumber Jerks&quot; (1955), and he also directed three cartoons (sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation) extolling the virtues of free-market capitalism: &quot;By Word of Mouse&quot; (1954), &quot;Heir-Conditioned&quot; (1955) and &quot;Yankee Dood It&quot; (1956), all three of which involved Sylvester. Freleng directed all three of the vintage Warner Brothers cartoons in which a drinking of Dr. Jekyll&#x27;s potion (of &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;) induces a series of monstrous transformations: &quot;Dr. Jerkyl&#x27;s Hide&quot; (1954), &quot;Hyde and Hare&quot; (1955) and &quot;Hyde and Go Tweet&quot; (1960). Other Freleng fancies were man at war with the insect world (as in &quot;Of Thee I Sting&quot; (1946) and &quot;Ant Pasted&quot; (1953)), an inebriated stork delivering the wrong baby (in &quot;A Mouse Divided&quot; (1952), &quot;Stork Naked&quot; (1955) and &quot;Apes of Wrath&quot; (1959)), and characters marrying for money and finding themselves with a shrewish wife and a troublesome step-son (&quot;His Bitter Half&quot; (1949) and &quot;Honey&#x27;s Money&quot; (1962)).

Freleng was occasionally the subject of in-jokes in Warner cartoons. In &quot;Canary Row&quot; (1950), there were billboards in the background of scenes advertising various products called &quot;Friz&quot;. The &quot;Hotel Friz&quot; was featured in &quot;Racketeer Rabbit&quot; (1946) and &quot;Frizby the Magician&quot; was one of the acts Bugs Bunny pitched in &quot;High Diving Hare&quot; (1949).

=== Musical knowledge and technique ===
Freleng was somewhat of a musical composer and a classically trained violinist who timed his cartoons on musical bar sheets. Freleng would time gags that best utilized Carl Stalling&#x27;s, Milt Franklyn&#x27;s or William Lava&#x27;s music. He was one of a very few directors at Warner Bros. to have musical knowledge for making cartoons. Every cartoon Freleng directed from the late 1930s to 1963 was made with his creative musical technique.

=== DePatie–Freleng Enterprises ===
Warner Bros. Cartoons was closed in 1963, leading Freleng to take a job at Hanna-Barbera Productions as story supervisor on their first feature, &quot;Hey There, It&#x27;s Yogi Bear!&quot; Freleng rented the same space from Warners to create cartoons with his now-former boss, producer David H. DePatie (the final producer hired by Warner Bros. to oversee the cartoon division), forming DePatie–Freleng Enterprises. When Warner decided to reopen their cartoon studio in 1964, due to Freleng asking them if he can rent the studio, eventually settling for $500, they did so in name only; DePatie–Freleng produced the cartoons into 1966.

The DePatie–Freleng studio&#x27;s signature achievement was The Pink Panther. DePatie–Freleng was commissioned to create the opening titles for the feature film &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963), for which layout artist and director Hawley Pratt and Freleng created a suave, cool cat character. The Pink Panther cartoon character became so popular that United Artists, distributors of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, had Freleng produce a short cartoon starring the character, &quot;The Pink Phink&quot; (1964).

After &quot;The Pink Phink&quot; won the 1965 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons), Freleng and DePatie responded by producing a whole series of Pink Panther cartoons. Other original cartoon series, among them &quot;The Inspector&quot;, &quot;The Ant and the Aardvark&quot;, &quot;Tijuana Toads&quot;, &quot;The Dogfather&quot;, &quot;Roland and Rattfink&quot; and &quot;Crazylegs Crane&quot;, soon followed. In 1969, &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, a Saturday morning anthology program featuring DePatie–Freleng cartoons, debuted on NBC. &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; and the other original DePatie–Freleng series would remain in production through 1980, with new cartoons produced for simultaneous Saturday morning broadcast and United Artists theatrical release.

Layout artist Hawley Pratt, who worked at DePatie–Freleng during the time, is credited with the creation of Frito-Lay&#x27;s Chester Cheetah, on the Food Network show &quot;Deep Fried Treats Unwrapped&quot;, though some sources say it was DDB Worldwide, while others credit Brad Morgan. The studio is also known for creating the color opening title sequence for the &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; television series. DePatie–Freleng also contributed special effects to the original version of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977), particularly the animation of the lightsaber blades, which was done by Korean animator Nelson Shin.

By 1967, DePatie and Freleng had moved their operations to the San Fernando Valley. Their studio was located on Hayvenhurst Avenue in Van Nuys. One of their projects, titled &quot;Goldilocks&quot;, featured Bing Crosby and his family, and had songs by the Sherman Brothers. At their new facilities, they continued to produce new cartoons until 1980, when they sold DePatie–Freleng to Marvel Comics, which renamed it Marvel Productions.

== Later career and death ==
Freleng later served as an executive producer on three 1980s &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; compilation features, &quot;The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie&quot; (1981), &quot;Bugs Bunny&#x27;s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales&quot; (1982), and &quot;Daffy Duck&#x27;s Fantastic Island&quot; (1983), 
which linked classic shorts with new animated sequences. 
In 1986, Freleng stepped down and gave his position at Warner Bros. to his secretary at the time, Kathleen Helppie-Shipley, who ended up being the second-longest producer of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies franchise, behind only Leon Schlesinger.

In 1994, the International Family Film Festival presented its first Lifetime Achievement of Excellence in Animation award to Freleng, and the award has since been referred to as the &quot;Friz Award&quot; in his honor.

On May 26, 1995, Friz Freleng died of natural causes at the UCLA Medical Center, aged 89. The WB animated TV series &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot;, and the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon &quot;From Hare to Eternity&quot; (which was the last one directed by Chuck Jones), were both dedicated to his memory. After his death, Cartoon Network aired a variation of one of their station idents with the words &quot;Friz Freleng: 1906–1995&quot; (the birth year is disputed) appearing and an announcer paying tribute to Freleng and his works. He is interred in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery.

Freleng is portrayed by Taylor Gray in the film &quot;Walt Before Mickey&quot; (2015).

<text>The Jamestown Exposition, also known as the Jamestown Ter-Centennial Exposition of 1907, was one of the many world&#x27;s fairs and expositions that were popular in the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, it was held from April 26 to December 1, 1907, at Sewell&#x27;s Point on Hampton Roads, in Norfolk, Virginia. It celebrated the first permanent English settlement in the present United States. In 1975, the 20 remaining exposition buildings were included on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district.

==Site selection==
Early in the 20th century, as the tercentennial of the 1607 Founding of Jamestown in the Virginia Colony neared, leaders in Norfolk, Virginia began a campaign to have the celebration held there. The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities had gotten the ball rolling in 1900 by calling for a celebration to honor the establishment of the first permanent English colony in the New World at Jamestown, to be held on the 300th anniversary.

During the planning phase, virtually no one thought that the original site of Jamestown would be suitable, as it was isolated and long-abandoned. There were no local facilities to handle large crowds, and it was believed that the fort housing the settlement had long ago been swallowed by the James River. No rail lines ran near Jamestown. Many Virginia residents thought that Richmond, the state capital, would be chosen as the site of the celebration.

On February 4, 1901, James M. Thomson began a campaign for the celebration in his Norfolk &quot;Dispatch&quot;, proclaiming: &quot;Norfolk is undoubtedly the proper place for the holding of this celebration. Norfolk is today the center of the most populous portion of Virginia, and every historical, business and sentimental reason can be adduced in favor of the celebration taking place here rather than in Richmond.&quot; The &quot;Dispatch&quot; was an unrelenting champion of Norfolk as the site for the exposition, noting in subsequent editorials that &quot;Richmond has absolutely no claim to the celebration except her location on the James River.&quot;

By September 1901, the Norfolk City Council had supported the project, and in December, 100 prominent residents of Hampton Roads journeyed to Richmond to urge Norfolk to be the site. In 1902, the Jamestown Exposition Co. was incorporated. Former Governor of Virginia Fitzhugh Lee, a nephew of General Robert E. Lee, was named its president.

The Company decided to locate the international exposition on a mile-long frontage at Sewell&#x27;s Point. The location was almost an equal distance from the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Newport News and Hampton. While hard to reach by land, it was much more favorably accessible by water, which ultimately proved a great asset.

===Issues with Sewell&#x27;s Point===

Because of the isolation of Sewell&#x27;s Point, the company&#x27;s choice made the site difficult to reach by land. Access to the site required the construction of new roads to develop it for the Exposition. Two existing streetcar lines had to be extended considerably to reach the site. The eastern portion of the newly built Tidewater Railway (soon to become part of the coal-hauling Virginian Railway) was rushed into service, and the local Norfolk Southern Railway agreed to add substantial passenger capacity in conjunction with the Tidewater Railway to prepare to move the thousands of daily attendees anticipated. New piers had to be constructed on the shore to move supplies to exposition buildings. Hotels had to be raised to handle the millions of expected exposition visitors. Bad weather slowed everything.

Another major setback was the death of Fitzhugh Lee in 1905 while traveling in New England to drum up trade for the celebration. Henry St. George Tucker III, a former Virginia Congressman, succeeded him. The Norfolk businessman David Lowenberg ran most of the operation as director general.

==Opening day==

Opening day was April 26, 1907, exactly 300 years after Christopher Newport and his band of English colonists made their first landing in Virginia at the point where the southern shore of the Chesapeake Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean. They recorded giving thanks, planting a cross, and naming the location Cape Henry. Within the next few weeks, they found and explored the harbor now known as Hampton Roads. Sailing upriver on its biggest tributary, the James River, they eventually settled at what they would call Jamestown to begin their first settlement.

The first day of the Exposition had its share of difficulties. Only a fifth of the electric lights could be turned on, and the Warpath recreation area was far from ready. Construction of the government pier left much of the ground in the center of the exposition muddy soup. Of the thirty-eight principal buildings and works that the Exposition Company planned for the fair, only fourteen had been completed by opening day—the Fire Engine House and the Waterfront Board Walk were completed only in the last two days. The company failed to complete two planned buildings, the Historic Art and Education buildings, by the Exposition&#x27;s end in late November.

Prominent visitors included President Theodore Roosevelt, who opened the exposition and presided over the naval review. After the opening day, attendance dropped sharply and never again achieved projections. The Exposition Company had initially lobbied the federal government for $1,640,000 and received a loan for an additional million, to be repaid through a lien on 40% of the gate receipts. When crowds failed to appear in the anticipated numbers—the exposition was attracting an average of 13,000 visitors daily, only 7,400 of whom paid entrance—the company could repay only $140,000 of the million-dollar loan. The fair began attracting negative attention in the press as early as January before it opened, as a divisive split between planning committee members became public. The press who arrived for the opening day found the grounds unfinished, the hotels overpriced, and the transportation between the fair and nearby towns insufficient.

==Exhibitions==

In time, things improved, and portions of the event became spectacular. Planners asked each US state to contribute a building to the Exposition. While some of these buildings offered exhibits on the states&#x27; history and industry, others primarily served as quasi-embassies for visitors from the state, providing sitting rooms and guest services. Lack of interest or funds prevented participation by all, but 21 states funded houses, which bore their names: for example, Pennsylvania House, Virginia House, New Hampshire House, etc. During the exposition, days were set aside to honor the states individually. The governor of each state usually appeared to greet visitors to the state&#x27;s house on these days. On June 10, 1907, &quot;Georgia Day,&quot; Theodore Roosevelt returned to the Exposition, delivering a speech on the steps of the Georgia Building, which had been modeled after his mother&#x27;s family&#x27;s home. Emily Nelson Ritchie McLean, the President General of the Daughters of the American Revolution, was also in attendance.

The site included a relief model of the Panama Canal, a wild animal show, a Wild West show, and a re-creation of the then-recent San Francisco earthquake. Possibly the most popular attraction was a re-creation of the Battle of Hampton Roads, the first battle between two ironclad warships, the USS &quot;Monitor&quot; and the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, which had taken place within sight of Sewell&#x27;s Point 40 years earlier during the Civil War. The exterior of the Merrimac-Monitor Building looked somewhat like a battleship, while the interior held a large, circular exhibit describing the battle.

===International Naval Review===

The event included the naval review of warship fleets on June 10 by President Theodore Roosevelt, who arrived on the presidential yacht &quot;Mayflower&quot;. As the news coverage of Battle of Tsushima, Treaty of Portsmouth, and President Roosevelt winning the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize for hosting the peace treaty conference at Portsmouth were fresh in the mind of people, display of naval and military technology was an important theme that distinguished this exposition from the World Fairs in the past. The review included the sixteen battleships of the US Navy Atlantic Fleet including USS Georgia and many warships from foreign countries. One such example was the Imperial Japanese Navy cruiser &quot;Tsukuba&quot;, displaying the newest naval concept of a &#x27;Battlecruiser&#x27; that had the speed of a cruiser with the firepower and protective armor of a battleship.

Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers also paid a visit, arriving in the latter&#x27;s yacht &quot;Kanawha&quot;. Ships of two squadrons commanded by Admiral Robley D. Evans stood off in the bay from Sewell&#x27;s Point. On opening day, an international fleet of fifty-one ships was on display. The assembly included 16 battleships, five cruisers, and six destroyers. The US Navy warships remained in Hampton Roads after the exposition closed and became President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Great White Fleet under Admiral Evans, which toured the globe as evidence of the nation&#x27;s military might.

In addition to the ships anchored at Hampton Roads, the exposition provided a campground sufficient to house five thousand troops. Military and &quot;semi-military&quot; men in uniform were admitted for fifty cents for a day&#x27;s admission. They were permitted to come and go after that as long as they were encamped at the exposition grounds and drilled regularly on the parade ground. This accounts for many of the 43% of people tallied entering the fair daily who did not pay admission. The organizers felt the troops provided informal entertainment and were an attraction to the exposition.

===Other technologies===

The railroads put on elaborate displays. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) displayed its entire F.F.V. passenger train. The New York Central (NYC) electric engine on display was part of its Grand Central Station modernization project in New York City. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) brought a -diameter section of its new East River Tunnel. The same section was later installed underwater as part of the link to the new Penn Station in New York City, with an inscription that it had been displayed at the Jamestown Exposition.

Other technology included late-model automobiles, auto-boats, and electric and steam traction engines, each in its highest stage of development.

===Negro Building===
A controversial feature of the exposition was its &quot;Negro Building,&quot; designed by W. Sydney Pittman, which displays showed the progress of African Americans. Richmond lawyer and businessman Giles Beecher Jackson was a leader in the formation of the Negro Department at the Jamestown Exposition and had worked hard to raise funds for the exhibition.

The Negro Building exhibit was charged with being a &quot;Jim Crow affair&quot; and criticized by prominent figures like W. E. B. Du Bois who voiced his complaint in &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;. However, other Black Americans saw the Negro Building as an achievement. The organizer, Giles B. Jackson, felt that having the exhibition in a separate Negro Hall allowed for a greater variety and completeness of presentation and that it could better highlight the achievements of African Americans. He said a separate building demonstrated black &quot;capacity as a producer and the maker of anything and everything that has been made by other races.&quot; For fairgoers sharing his opinion, many of whom were Black middle-class Southerners, the Negro Building represented an achievement that few white Southerners would have thought possible: the building was architecturally elegant, designed and built by blacks, with funds raised by blacks. A series of dioramas by Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, a black woman artist from Philadelphia, comprised the first artwork done by an African American with federal funds.

Exhibits from both occupational and classical black educational institutions were represented. While the Exposition was a money-loser and derided by many in the press, the Negro Hall achieved nearly universal praise. It was the only exhibit visited by President Roosevelt in either of his visits. Although most commercial ventures lost money, the branch bank in the Negro Hall, affiliated with a local African-American institution, recorded one of the Exposition&#x27;s only profits, doing $75,731.87 in business in the course of the fair.

==Results==

In conjunction with the first day of Exposition, the U.S. Post Office issued a series of three commemorative stamps celebrating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. The 1-cent value portrayed Captain John Smith, the 2-cent value depicts the landing of Captain Smith and colonists at Chesapeake Bay, and the 5-cent depicts Pocahontas.
The Exposition closed on December 1, 1907, as a financial failure, losing several million dollars. Attendance had been 3 million, a fraction of the numbers promised by the promoters. But, it had other benefits for the United States, Norfolk, and Hampton Roads.

Nearly every Congressman and Senator of prominence had attended the exposition, which showcased Sewell&#x27;s Point. Of naval importance in the early American Civil War, it had been virtually forgotten since shortly after its bombardment and returned to Union control in 1862. The admirals in Norfolk urged redevelopment of the exposition site as a Naval Base to use the infrastructure that had been built.

Nearly ten years would elapse before the idea, given impetus by World War I, would become a reality. The new Naval Base was aided by the improvements remaining from the Exposition, the strategic location at Sewell&#x27;s Point on Hampton Roads, and the large amount of vacant land in the area. The coal piers and storage yards of the Virginian Railway (VGN), built by William N. Page and Henry H. Rogers and completed in 1909, were immediately adjacent to the Exposition site. The well-engineered VGN was a valuable link directly to the bituminous coal of southern West Virginia, which the Navy strongly preferred for its steam-powered ships.

On June 28, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson set aside $2.8 million for land purchase and the erection of storehouses and piers for what was to become the Navy Base. Of the originally acquired, 367 had been the old Jamestown Exposition grounds. The military property was later expanded considerably. The former Virginian Railway coal piers, land, and an adjacent coal storage facility owned by Norfolk &amp; Western Railway (which merged with the VGN in 1959) were added in the 1960s and 1970s. The base now includes over .
Some of the exposition buildings which were taken over by the Navy remain in use , primarily as admirals&#x27; quarters for the Navy Base. Thirteen of the state houses can still be seen on Dillingham Boulevard at the Naval Station Norfolk, on what has been called &quot;Admiral&#x27;s Row.&quot; The Pennsylvania House, which through the first part of the century served as the Officer&#x27;s Club, later served as the Hampton Roads Naval Museum for many years until it was relocated in 1994 to Nauticus on the harbor in Norfolk. Other surviving state buildings on their original sites are the Georgia, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia House, as well as the Baker&#x27;s Chocolate Company House. The remaining state buildings were moved in 1934, including the Delaware, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Michigan, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont buildings. The Illinois Building was relocated next to the North Dakota Building. The Kenneth L. Howard House at Dunn, North Carolina is a copy of the North Carolina building.

<text>Anston is a civil parish in South Yorkshire, England, formally known as North and South Anston. The parish of Anston consists of the settlements of North Anston and South Anston, divided by the Anston Brook.

== History ==
Anston, first recorded as &quot;Anestan&quot; is from the Old English &quot;āna stān&quot;, meaning &quot;single or solitary stone&quot;. In the Domesday Book (1086) North and South Anston (&quot;Anestan&quot; and &quot;Litelanstan&quot;) were both held by Roger de Busli.

South Anston was an ancient parish in the wapentake of Strafforth and Tickhill in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was a large parish, also known as Anston cum Membris, which also included North Anston and the township of Woodsetts. When civil parishes were created in 1866, Woodsetts became a separate civil parish and the remaining part of the parish became the civil parish of North and South Anston. In 1974 the parish was transferred to the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in the new county of South Yorkshire.

The original interest for the area (beyond Anston&#x27;s agricultural uses) was the sandy &quot;Anstone&quot; Magnesian Limestone, but the real growth in Anston&#x27;s population was more due to the sinking of the Dinnington Main Colliery in the early 20th century.

Anston railway station opened on 20 May 1912 and closed on 2 December 1929.

==North Anston==

North Anston is located at about 53° 21&#x27; 20&quot; N, 1° 13&#x27; W and merges seamlessly into the town of Dinnington to the north. Today, it is largely a commuter base for Sheffield, Worksop and Rotherham, and is mainly made up of suburban housing estates. The picturesque &quot;old village&quot; at the south-east however retains its green, and the village wells. The surrounding landscape contains several disused quarries: the plantations to the east, and Greenlands Park to the west being prime examples.

There are currently three pubs in North Anston: the Little Mester on Nursery Road, the Cutler on Woodsetts Road, and Anston Club on Main Street.

North Anston is home to the Tropical Butterfly House, Wildlife and Falconry Centre, a popular attraction seeing around 80,000 visitors every year.

It is also home to the limestone gorge of Anston Stones Wood, a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Anston stones wood stretches across the border of South Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The wood is believed to be part of a medieval smuggling route. Evidence of this has been found in the valley an example of this is Dead Man&#x27;s Cave at Anston Gorge, a large cave carved out of the limestone used for hiding goods. An 1867 excavation of Dead Man&#x27;s Cave pointed to Palaeolithic occupation, through the discovery of flint tools and a reindeer toe bone.

=== Public transport ===
North Anston is on main Rother Valley South bus routes to Dinnington, Worksop and Sheffield with Links to Rotherham too.

The nearest railway station from North and South Anston is Kiveton Park and Kiveton Bridge, X5 (First South Yorkshire) provide a link between Anston and the railway station.

==South Anston==

South Anston is located at about , and is separated from North Anston by the Anston Brook, the A57 road and a freight railway-line. It is more rural than its northern partner. South Anston contains the parish church of St. James, and two Methodist chapels (dating from 1871 and 1935). It also contains Anston&#x27;s working quarries which continue to mine stone for the building industry. Its location is ideal as it is rural enough for enjoy a range walks from the village yet near enough to Sheffield to enjoy a wealth of infrastructure and transport links.
There are two pubs in South Anston: the Loyal Trooper and the Leeds Arms.

To the south of the village lies the Chesterfield Canal. It was from a dock just to the south of Dog Kennel Lane that stone taken from quarries in South Anston was transported to London for the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster following the fire in the 1830s. The blocks of stone were taken by horse-drawn sled to the canal, then taken down to West Stockwith where they were transferred to sailing barges for the journey to London.

== Governance ==

North and South Anston is part of Rother Valley Constituency, the current Member of Parliament is Jake Richards MP (Labour).

Anston is part of the Anston and Woodsetts ward of Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council. It is represented by Councillors; Tim Baum-Dixon (Conservative), Drew Tarmey (Liberal Democrat) and John Blackham (Conservative).

<doc id="197484" wikidata="Q12887" url="?curid=197484" title="Schaerbeek">
<text>&#x27; (French, ; former Dutch spelling) or &#x27; (modern Dutch, ) is one of the 19 municipalities of the Brussels-Capital Region, Belgium. Located in the north-eastern part of the region, it is bordered by the City of Brussels, Etterbeek, Evere and Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch).

Schaerbeek has a multicultural identity stemming from its diverse population. , the municipality had a population of 130,690 inhabitants. The total area is , which gives a population density of , twice the average of Brussels.

==Toponymy==

===Etymology===
The first mention of Schaerbeek&#x27;s name was &quot;Scarenbecca&quot;, recorded in a document from the Bishop of Cambrai in 1120. The origin of the name may come from the Franconian (Old Dutch) words (&quot;notch&quot;, &quot;score&quot;) and (&quot;creek&quot;, &quot;beck&quot;).

Schaerbeek is nicknamed &quot;the city of donkeys&quot; (, ). This name is reminiscent of times when people of Schaerbeek, who were cultivators of sour cherries primarily for Kriek production, would arrive at the Brussels marketplace with donkeys laden with sour cherries. Donkeys are still kept in Josaphat Park, and sour cherry trees line the streets of the Diamant Quarter of Schaerbeek (the /, the /, and the /). The / is named after these trees.

==History==

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
The period at which human activity started in Schaerbeek can be inferred from the Stone Age flint tools that were recovered in the Josaphat valley. Tombs and coins dating from the reign of Roman Emperor Hadrian (2nd century AD) were also found near the old Roman roads that crossed Schaerbeek&#x27;s territory.

The first mention of the town&#x27;s name appears in a legal document dated 1120, whereby the Bishop of Cambrai granted the administration of the churches of &quot;Scarenbecca&quot; and &quot;Everna&quot; (today&#x27;s neighbouring Evere) to the canons of Soignies, located in modern-day Hainaut, Belgium. Politically, the town was part of the Duchy of Brabant. In 1301, John II, Duke of Brabant, had the town administered by the schepen (aldermen) of Brussels. A new church dedicated to Saint Servatius was built around that same time, at the same location as the old church.

At the end of the 14th century, the lands of Schaerbeek that belonged to the Lords of Kraainem were sold and reconverted into a hunting ground. The official entry of the visiting Dukes of Burgundy into Brussels, their second capital, was also through Schaerbeek, where they had to swear to uphold the city&#x27;s privileges. The game reservation and the rural character of the village lasted until the end of the 18th century. The areas not covered by woods were used to cultivate vegetables and grow vines. In 1540, Schaerbeek counted 112 houses and 600 inhabitants.

===16th–19th centuries===
Until the 16th century, the village had lived in relative peace. This would change in the middle of the 16th century as the Reformation set in. Schaerbeek suffered through ravages and destruction about a dozen times over the following two centuries, starting in the 1570s with William the Silent&#x27;s mercenary troops fighting the Catholic Duke of Alba. Spanish, French, British, and Bavarian troops all came through Schaerbeek, with the usual exactions and requisitions inflicted on the population.

After the French Revolution, it was decreed that Schaerbeek would be taken away from Brussels and proclaimed an independent municipality, with its own mayor, schepen, and municipal assembly. On 27 September 1830, during the Belgian Revolution, some fighting occurred in the Josaphat valley between the revolutionary troops and the retreating Dutch troops. In 1879, a more modern Church of St. Servatius was built near the old one, which was eventually demolished in 1905. The Municipal Hall and Schaerbeek railway station were built in 1887 and 1902, respectively. In 1889, the shooting range known as the &quot;Tir national&quot; was established.

At the end of the 19th and in the early 20th centuries, Schaerbeek became home to the gentry. The / was laid out to herald a new, tree-filled residential district for the city&#x27;s burgeoning middle classes, many of whom employed the period&#x27;s best architects to design their new homes. Gustave Strauven, and were just three of the architects who reinvented family houses, apartment buildings and educational buildings in the Art Nouveau style.

===20th and 21st centuries===
At the turn of the 20th century, Schaerbeek was a booming suburb which attracted a large middle-class population. In 1904, the newly landscaped Josaphat Park was inaugurated. One year later, the old St. Servatius&#x27; Church, the last witness to Schaerbeek&#x27;s medieval past, was demolished. In 1915, the British nurse Edith Cavell was executed by an occupying German Army firing squad at the &quot;Tir national&quot;. Dwight D. Eisenhower came to visit the municipality at the close of World War II. Five years later, the population of Schaerbeek peaked at 125,000 inhabitants.

====2016 terrorist attacks====
On the morning of 22 March 2016, three coordinated bombings occurred in Belgium in which the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility. In these attacks, at least 31 victims and two suicide bombers were killed, and 300 other people were injured. Hours after the attacks, police were pointed to a home in Schaerbeek by the taxi driver who drove the suspects to Brussels Airport. They raided the home and found a nail bomb, of acetone peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and an ISIL flag. Inside a waste container near the house, they also found a computer belonging to Ibrahim El Bakraoui who is believed to have carried out suicide bombings during the attacks along with his brother.

Nearly seven months later, on 5 October, three police officers were attacked by a man with a camping knife in Schaerbeek. Two of them suffered stab wounds, while the third was physically assaulted but otherwise uninjured. The assailant was then shot in the leg, subdued, and taken to hospital for medical treatment. He was charged with attempted terrorism-related murder but the court did not see these charges proven. He was convicted to a nine-year prison sentence for assault and battery.

==Districts==
There are two distinct parts of Schaerbeek; an eastern part and a western part. The eastern part (the area that includes the /, the /, the Fleurs Quarter, the /, the Diamant Quarter and Josaphat Park) is an affluent area noted for its architecture and its convenient location (close to the EU institutions and the financial heart of the city, as well as NATO&#x27;s headquarters).

The western part (the area near Brussels-North railway station, the / and the Van Praet bridge) is home to Brussels&#x27; large Belgian Turkish community. The area around St. Mary&#x27;s Royal Church is dubbed the &quot;Little Anatolia&quot; (, ) because of all the Turkish restaurants and shops on the Chaussée de Haecht. The area is also home to a significant Belgian Moroccan population and other immigrant communities such as Spanish, Congolese, and Asian immigrants. However, the district offers a social blend because of the numerous schools like the Hogeschool Sint-Lukas Brussel, the municipal administrations and the proximity of the Rue Royale/Koningsstraat.

==Main sights==
* Schaerbeek counts a number of Art Deco and Art Nouveau houses, including the Autrique House, the first house built by Victor Horta in the Brussels area.
* The Municipal Hall of Schaerbeek, designed in neo-Flemish Renaissance style by the architect , was inaugurated by King Leopold II in 1887.

* The Clockarium is a clock museum. There is also a beer museum and a mechanical organ museum nearby.

Schaerbeek Cemetery, despite its name, is actually located in Evere.

==Demographics==

===Foreign population===
Schaerbeek has a large concentration of immigrants from other countries, and their children, including many of Turkish ancestry, a significant part of which originates from Afyon or Emirdağ, Turkey.

Similar to Molenbeek, Schaerbeek has a large Muslim population. , the largest share of Muslims in Schaerbeek is of Moroccan origin, but there are also significant communities of Turks and Albanians. That year, the mayor of Schaerbeek Bernard Clerfayt (DéFI) argued that the diversity in the foreign population means there is a lack of a ghetto effect, and Molenbeek&#x27;s then-mayor Françoise Schepmans (MR) stated that the foreign population in Schaerbeek was more diverse than that of Molenbeek. 22% of young people in Schaerbeek are unemployed. The municipality lies in a semi-circle of neighbourhoods in Brussels often referred to as the &quot;poor croissant&quot;.

, taking into account the nationality of birth of the parents, 52.78% of Schaerbeek&#x27;s population is of non-European origin (predominantly Moroccan and Turkish), 21.13% of European origin other than Belgian (mainly Bulgarian, Romanian, French, Spanish, and Polish), while 18.46% is solely of native Belgian ancestry.

==Politics==
The current city council was elected in the October 2018 elections. The current mayor of Schaerbeek is Bernard Clerfayt, a member of DéFl, who is in coalition on the municipal council with Ecolo.

===2003 election incident===
During the Belgian federal election of 18 May 2003, a candidate received 4,096 unexplained extra votes. After an inquiry, the anomaly was attributed to a single-event upset in an electronic voting machine, likely to have been caused by an ionising particle.

<text>A SIM card or SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) is an integrated circuit (IC) intended to securely store an international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers on mobile telephone devices (such as mobile phones and laptops). SIMs are also able to store address book contacts information, and may be protected using a PIN code to prevent unauthorized use.

SIMs are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they are needed only for LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards are also used in various satellite phones, smart watches, computers, or cameras. The first SIM cards were the size of credit and bank cards; sizes were reduced several times over the years, usually keeping electrical contacts the same, to fit smaller-sized devices. SIMs are transferable between different mobile devices by removing the card itself. 

Technically, the actual physical card is known as a universal integrated circuit card (UICC); this smart card is usually made of PVC with embedded contacts and semiconductors, with the SIM as its primary component. In practice the term &quot;SIM card&quot; is still used to refer to the entire unit and not simply the IC. A SIM contains a unique serial number, integrated circuit card identification (ICCID), international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, and four passwords: a personal identification number (PIN) for ordinary use, and a personal unblocking key (PUK) for PIN unlocking as well as a second pair (called PIN2 and PUK2 respectively) which are used for managing fixed dialing number and some other functionality. In Europe, the serial SIM number (SSN) is also sometimes accompanied by an international article number (IAN) or a European article number (EAN) required when registering online for the subscription of a prepaid card.As of 2020, eSIM is superseding physical SIM cards in some domains, including cellular telephony. eSIM uses a software-based SIM embedded into an irremovable eUICC.

== History and procurement ==
The SIM card is a type of smart card, the basis for which is the silicon integrated circuit (IC) chip. The idea of incorporating a silicon IC chip onto a plastic card originates from the late 1960s. Smart cards have since used MOS integrated circuit chips, along with MOS memory technologies such as flash memory and EEPROM (electrically EPROM).

The SIM was initially specified by the ETSI in the specification TS 11.11. This describes the physical and logical behaviour of the SIM. With the development of UMTS, the specification work was partially transferred to 3GPP. 3GPP is now responsible for the further development of applications like SIM (TS 51.011) and USIM (TS 31.102) and ETSI for the further development of the physical card UICC.

The first SIM card was manufactured in 1991 by Munich smart-card maker Giesecke+Devrient, who sold the first 300 SIM cards to the Finnish wireless network operator Radiolinja, who launched the world&#x27;s first commercial 2G GSM cell network that year.

Today, SIM cards are considered ubiquitous, allowing over 8 billion devices to connect to cellular networks around the world daily. According to the International Card Manufacturers Association (ICMA), there were 5.4 billion SIM cards manufactured globally in 2016 creating over $6.5 billion in revenue for traditional SIM card vendors. The rise of cellular IoT and 5G networks was predicted by Ericsson to drive the growth of the addressable market for SIM cards to over 20 billion devices by 2020. The introduction of embedded-SIM (eSIM) and remote SIM provisioning (RSP) from the GSMA may disrupt the traditional SIM card ecosystem with the entrance of new players specializing in &quot;digital&quot; SIM card provisioning and other value-added services for mobile network operators.

== Design ==

There are three operating voltages for SIM cards: , and (ISO/IEC 7816-3 classes A, B and C, respectively). The operating voltage of the majority of SIM cards launched before 1998 was . SIM cards produced subsequently are compatible with and . Modern cards support , and .

Modern SIM cards allow applications to load when the SIM is in use by the subscriber. These applications communicate with the handset or a server using SIM Application Toolkit, which was initially specified by 3GPP in TS 11.14. (There is an identical ETSI specification with different numbering.) ETSI and 3GPP maintain the SIM specifications. The main specifications are: ETSI TS 102 223 (the toolkit for smart cards), ETSI TS 102 241 (API), ETSI TS 102 588 (application invocation), and ETSI TS 131 111 (toolkit for more SIM-likes). SIM toolkit applications were initially written in native code using proprietary APIs. To provide interoperability of the applications, ETSI chose Java Card. A multi-company collaboration called GlobalPlatform defines some extensions on the cards, with additional APIs and features like more cryptographic security and RFID contactless use added.

== Data ==

SIM cards store network-specific information used to authenticate and identify subscribers on the network. The most important of these are the ICCID, IMSI, authentication key (Ki), local area identity (LAI) and operator-specific emergency number. The SIM also stores other carrier-specific data such as the SMSC (Short Message service center) number, service provider name (SPN), service dialing numbers (SDN), advice-of-charge parameters and value-added service (VAS) applications. (Refer to GSM 11.11.)

SIM cards can come in various data capacities, from to at least . All can store a maximum of 250 contacts on the SIM, but while the has room for 33 Mobile country code (MCCs) or &quot;network identifiers&quot;, the version has room for 80 MNCs. This is used by network operators to store data on preferred networks, mostly used when the SIM is not in its home network but is roaming. The network operator that issued the SIM card can use this to have a phone connect to a preferred network that is more economic for the provider instead of having to pay the network operator that the phone discovered first. This does not mean that a phone containing this SIM card can connect to a maximum of only 33 or 80 networks, instead it means that the SIM card issuer can specify only up to that number of preferred networks. If a SIM is outside these preferred networks, it uses the first or best available network.

=== ICCID ===
Each SIM is internationally identified by its integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID). Nowadays ICCID numbers are also used to identify eSIM profiles, not only physical SIM cards. ICCIDs are stored in the SIM cards and are also engraved or printed on the SIM card body during a process called personalisation.

The ICCID is defined by the ITU-T recommendation E.118 as the &quot;primary account number&quot;. Its layout is based on ISO/IEC 7812. According to E.118, the number can be up to 19 digits long, including a single check digit calculated using the Luhn algorithm. However, the GSM Phase 1 defined the ICCID length as an opaque data field, 10 octets (20 digits) in length, whose structure is specific to a mobile network operator.

The number is composed of three subparts:
*Issuer identification number (IIN)
*Check digit
*Individual account identification
Their format is as follows.

Issuer identification number (IIN)

* Maximum of seven digits:
** Major industry identifier (MII), 2 fixed digits, 89 for telecommunication purposes.
** Country code, 2 or 3 digits, as defined by ITU-T recommendation E.164.
*** NANP countries, apart from Canada, use 01, i.e. prepending a zero to their common calling code +1
*** Canada uses 302
*** Russia uses 701, i.e. appending 01 to its calling code +7
*** Kazakhstan uses 997, even though it shares the calling code +7 with Russia
** Issuer identifier, 1–4 digits.
** Often identical to the Mobile country code (MCC).

Individual account identification
* Its length is variable, but every number under one IIN has the same length.
** Often identical to the Mobile identification number (MIN).

Check digit
* Single digit calculated from the other digits using the Luhn algorithm.

With the GSM Phase 1 specification using 10 octets into which ICCID is stored as packed BCD, the data field has room for 20 digits with hexadecimal digit &quot;F&quot; being used as filler when necessary. In practice, this means that on GSM cards there are 20-digit (19+1) and 19-digit (18+1) ICCIDs in use, depending upon the issuer. However, a single issuer always uses the same size for its ICCIDs.

As required by E.118, the ITU-T updates a list of all current internationally assigned IIN codes in its Operational Bulletins which are published twice a month (the last as of January 2019 was No. 1163 from 1 January 2019). ITU-T also publishes complete lists: as of August 2023, the list issued on 1 December 2018 was current, having all issuer identifier numbers before 1 December 2018.

=== International mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) ===
SIM cards are identified on their individual operator networks by a unique &quot;international mobile subscriber identity&quot; (IMSI). Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The format is:
* The first three digits represent the Mobile country code (MCC).
* The next two or three digits represent the Mobile network code (MNC). Three-digit MNC codes are allowed by E.212 but are mainly used in the United States and Canada. One MCC can have both 2 digit and 3 digit MNCs, an example is 350 007.
* The next digits represent the Mobile identification number (MSIN).
* Normally there are 10 digits, but can be fewer in the case of a 3-digit MNC or if national regulations indicate that the total length of the IMSI should be less than 15 digits.
* Digits are different from country to country.
=== Authentication key (Ki) ===
The Ki is a 128-bit value used in authenticating the SIMs on a GSM mobile network (for USIM network, the K is still needed but other parameters are also needed). Each SIM holds a unique Ki assigned to it by the operator during the personalisation process. The Ki is also stored in a database (termed authentication center or AuC) on the carrier&#x27;s network.

The SIM card is designed to prevent someone from getting the Ki by using the smart-card interface. Instead, the SIM card provides a function, &quot;Run GSM Algorithm&quot;, that the phone uses to pass data to the SIM card to be signed with the Ki. This, by design, makes using the SIM card mandatory unless the Ki can be extracted from the SIM card, or the carrier is willing to reveal the Ki. In practice, the GSM cryptographic algorithm for computing a signed response (SRES_1/SRES_2: see steps 3 and 4, below) from the Ki has certain vulnerabilities that can allow the extraction of the Ki from a SIM card and the making of a duplicate SIM card.

Authentication process:

# When the mobile equipment starts up, it obtains the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) from the SIM card, and passes this to the mobile operator, requesting access and authentication. The mobile equipment may have to pass a PIN to the SIM card before the SIM card reveals this information.
# The operator network searches its database for the incoming IMSI and its associated Ki.
# The operator network then generates a random number (RAND, which is a nonce) and signs it with the Ki associated with the IMSI (and stored on the SIM card), computing another number, that is split into the Signed Response 1 (SRES_1, 32 bits) and the encryption key Kc (64 bits).
# The operator network then sends the RAND to the mobile equipment, which passes it to the SIM card. The SIM card signs it with its Ki, producing Signed Response 2 (SRES_2) and Kc, which it gives to the mobile equipment. The mobile equipment passes SRES_2 on to the operator network.
# The operator network then compares its computed SRES_1 with the computed SRES_2 that the mobile equipment returned. If the two numbers match, the SIM is authenticated and the mobile equipment is granted access to the operator&#x27;s network. Kc is used to encrypt all further communications between the mobile equipment and the operator.

=== Location area identity ===
The SIM stores network state information, which is received from the location area identity (LAI). Operator networks are divided into location areas, each having a unique LAI number. When the device changes locations, it stores the new LAI to the SIM and sends it back to the operator network with its new location. If the device is power cycled, it takes data off the SIM, and searches for the prior LAI.

=== SMS messages and contacts ===
Most SIM cards store a number of SMS messages and phone book contacts. It stores the contacts in simple &quot;name and number&quot; pairs. Entries that contain multiple phone numbers and additional phone numbers are usually not stored on the SIM card. When a user tries to copy such entries to a SIM, the handset&#x27;s software breaks them into multiple entries, discarding information that is not a phone number. The number of contacts and messages stored depends on the SIM; early models stored as few as five messages and 20 contacts, while modern SIM cards can usually store over 250 contacts.

== Formats ==
SIM cards have been made smaller over the years; functionality is independent of format. Full-size SIM was followed by mini-SIM, micro-SIM, and nano-SIM. SIM cards are also made to embed in devices.


All versions of the non-embedded SIM cards share the same ISO/IEC 7816 pin arrangement.

=== Full-size SIM ===
The &quot;full-size SIM&quot; or (1FF or the 1st form factor) was the first form factor to appear. It was the size of a credit card (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm × 0.76 mm).

=== Mini-SIM ===

The &quot;mini-SIM&quot; or (2FF , 2nd form factor) card has the same contact arrangement as the full-size SIM card and is normally supplied within a full-size card carrier, attached by a number of linking pieces. This arrangement (defined in ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1/000) lets such a card be used in a device that requires a full-size card or in a device that requires a mini-SIM card, after breaking the linking pieces. As the full-size SIM is obsolete, some suppliers refer to the mini-SIM as a &quot;standard SIM&quot; or &quot;regular SIM&quot;.

=== Micro-SIM ===
The &quot;micro-SIM&quot; (or 3FF) card has the same thickness and contact arrangements, but reduced length and width as shown in the table above.

The micro-SIM was introduced by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) along with SCP, 3GPP (UTRAN/GERAN), 3GPP2 (CDMA2000), ARIB, GSM Association (GSMA SCaG and GSMNA), GlobalPlatform, Liberty Alliance, and the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) for the purpose of fitting into devices too small for a mini-SIM card.

The form factor was mentioned in the December 1998 3GPP SMG9 UMTS Working Party, which is the standards-setting body for GSM SIM cards, and the form factor was agreed upon in late 2003.

The micro-SIM was designed for backward compatibility. The major issue for backward compatibility was the contact area of the chip. Retaining the same contact area makes the micro-SIM compatible with the prior, larger SIM readers through the use of plastic cutout surrounds. The SIM was also designed to run at the same speed (5 MHz) as the prior version. The same size and positions of pins resulted in numerous &quot;How-to&quot; tutorials and YouTube videos with detailed instructions how to cut a mini-SIM card to micro-SIM size.

The chairman of EP SCP, Klaus Vedder, said

Micro-SIM cards were introduced by various mobile service providers for the launch of the original iPad, and later for smartphones, from April 2010. The iPhone 4 was the first smartphone to use a micro-SIM card in June 2010, followed by many others.

=== Nano-SIM ===
After a debate in early 2012 between a few designs created by Apple, Nokia and RIM, Apple&#x27;s design for an even smaller SIM card was accepted by the ETSI. The &quot;nano-SIM&quot; (or 4FF) card was introduced in June 2012, when mobile service providers in various countries first supplied it for phones that supported the format. The nano-SIM measures and reduces the previous format to the contact area while maintaining the existing contact arrangements. A small rim of isolating material is left around the contact area to avoid short circuits with the socket. The nano-SIM can be put into adapters for use with devices designed for 2FF or 3FF SIMs, and is made thinner for that purpose, and telephone companies give due warning about this. 4FF is thick, compared to the of its predecessors.

The iPhone 5, released in September 2012, was the first device to use a nano-SIM card, followed by other handsets.

== Security ==
In July 2013, Karsten Nohl, a security researcher from SRLabs, described vulnerabilities in some SIM cards that supported DES, which, despite its age, is still used by some operators. The attack could lead to the phone being remotely cloned or let someone steal payment credentials from the SIM. Further details of the research were provided at BlackHat on 31 July 2013. In response, the International Telecommunication Union said that the development was &quot;hugely significant&quot; and that it would be contacting its members.

In February 2015, The Intercept reported that the NSA and GCHQ had stolen the encryption keys (Ki&#x27;s) used by Gemalto (now known as Thales DIS, manufacturer of 2 billion SIM cards annually) ), enabling these intelligence agencies to monitor voice and data communications without the knowledge or approval of cellular network providers or judicial oversight. Having finished its investigation, Gemalto claimed that it has “reasonable grounds” to believe that the NSA and GCHQ carried out an operation to hack its network in 2010 and 2011, but says the number of possibly stolen keys would not have been massive.

In September 2019, Cathal Mc Daid, a security researcher from Adaptive Mobile Security, described how vulnerabilities in some SIM cards that contained the S@T Browser library were being actively exploited. This vulnerability was named Simjacker. Attackers were using the vulnerability to track the location of thousands of mobile phone users in several countries. Further details of the research were provided at VirusBulletin on 3 October 2019.

== Developments ==
When GSM was already in use, the specifications were further developed and enhanced with functionality such as SMS and GPRS. These development steps are referred as releases by ETSI. Within these development cycles, the SIM specification was enhanced as well: new voltage classes, formats and files were introduced.

=== USIM === 
In GSM-only times, the SIM consisted of the hardware and the software. With the advent of UMTS, this naming was split: the SIM was now an application and hence only software. The hardware part was called UICC. This split was necessary because UMTS introduced a new application, the universal subscriber identity module (USIM). The USIM brought, among other things, security improvements like mutual authentication and longer encryption keys, and an improved address book.

=== UICC ===

&quot;SIM cards&quot; in developed countries today are usually UICCs containing at least a SIM application and a USIM application. This configuration is necessary because older GSM only handsets are solely compatible with the SIM application and some UMTS security enhancements rely on the USIM application.

=== Other variants ===
On cdmaOne networks, the equivalent of the SIM card is the R-UIM and the equivalent of the SIM application is the CSIM.
A &quot;virtual SIM&quot; is a mobile phone number provided by a mobile network operator that does not require a SIM card to connect phone calls to a user&#x27;s mobile phone.

=== Embedded SIM (eSIM) ===

An embedded SIM (eSIM) is a form of programmable SIM that is embedded directly into a device. The surface mount format provides the same electrical interface as the full size, 2FF and 3FF SIM cards, but is soldered to a circuit board as part of the manufacturing process. In M2M applications where there is no requirement to change the SIM card, this avoids the requirement for a connector, improving reliability and security. An eSIM can be provisioned remotely; end-users can add or remove operators without the need to physically swap a SIM from the device or use multiple eSIM profiles at the same time.

The eSIM standard, initially introduced in 2016, has progressively supplanted traditional physical SIM cards across various sectors, notably in cellular telephony. In September 2017, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 3 featuring eSIM. In October 2018, Apple introduced the iPad Pro (3rd generation), which was the first iPad to support eSIM. In September 2022, Apple introduced the iPhone 14 series which was the first eSIM exclusive iPhone in the United States.

=== Integrated SIM (iSIM) ===
An integrated SIM (iSIM) is a form of SIM directly integrated into the modem chip or main processor of the device itself. As a consequence they are smaller, cheaper and more reliable than eSIMs, they can improve security and ease the logistics and production of small devices i.e. for IoT applications. In 2021, Deutsche Telekom introduced the nuSIM, an &quot;Integrated SIM for IoT&quot;.

== Usage in mobile phone standards ==

The use of SIM cards is mandatory in GSM devices.

The satellite phone networks Iridium, Thuraya and Inmarsat&#x27;s BGAN also use SIM cards. Sometimes, these SIM cards work in regular GSM phones and also allow GSM customers to roam in satellite networks by using their own SIM cards in a satellite phone.

Japan&#x27;s 2G PDC system (which was shut down in 2012; SoftBank Mobile shut down PDC from 31 March 2010) also specified a SIM, but this has never been implemented commercially. The specification of the interface between the Mobile Equipment and the SIM is given in the RCR STD-27 annexe 4. The Subscriber Identity Module Expert Group was a committee of specialists assembled by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to draw up the specifications (GSM 11.11) for interfacing between smart cards and mobile telephones. In 1994, the name SIMEG was changed to SMG9.

Japan&#x27;s current and next-generation cellular systems are based on W-CDMA (UMTS) and CDMA2000 and all use SIM cards. However, Japanese CDMA2000-based phones are locked to the R-UIM they are associated with and thus, the cards are not interchangeable with other Japanese CDMA2000 handsets (though they may be inserted into GSM/WCDMA handsets for roaming purposes outside Japan).

CDMA-based devices originally did not use a removable card, and the service for these phones is bound to a unique identifier contained in the handset itself. This is most prevalent in operators in the Americas. The first publication of the TIA-820 standard (also known as 3GPP2 C.S0023) in 2000 defined the Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM). Card-based CDMA devices are most prevalent in Asia.

The equivalent of a SIM in UMTS is called the universal integrated circuit card (UICC), which runs a USIM application. The UICC is still colloquially called a &quot;SIM card&quot;.

== SIM and carriers ==
The SIM card introduced a new and significant business opportunity for  who lease capacity from one of the network operators rather than owning or operating a cellular telecoms network and only provide a SIM card to their customers. MVNOs first appeared in Denmark, Hong Kong, Finland and the UK. By 2011 they existed in over 50 countries, including most of Europe, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and parts of Asia, and accounted for approximately 10% of all mobile phone subscribers around the world.

On some networks, the mobile phone is locked to its carrier SIM card, meaning that the phone only works with SIM cards from the specific carrier. This is more common in markets where mobile phones are heavily subsidised by the carriers, and the business model depends on the customer staying with the service provider for a minimum term (typically 12, 18 or 24 months). SIM cards that are issued by providers with an associated contract, but where the carrier does not provide a mobile device (such as a mobile phone) are called &quot;SIM-only&quot; deals. Common examples are the GSM networks in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Poland. UK mobile networks ended SIM lock practices in December 2021. Many businesses offer the ability to remove the SIM lock from a phone, effectively making it possible to then use the phone on any network by inserting a different SIM card. Mostly, GSM and 3G mobile handsets can easily be unlocked and used on any suitable network with any SIM card.

In countries where the phones are not subsidised, e.g., India, Israel and Belgium, all phones are unlocked. Where the phone is not locked to its SIM card, the users can easily switch networks by simply replacing the SIM card of one network with that of another while using only one phone. This is typical, for example, among users who may want to optimise their carrier&#x27;s traffic by different tariffs to different friends on different networks, or when travelling internationally.

In 2016, carriers started using the concept of automatic SIM reactivation whereby they let users reuse expired SIM cards instead of purchasing new ones when they wish to re-subscribe to that operator. This is particularly useful in countries where prepaid calls dominate and where competition drives high churn rates, as users had to return to a carrier shop to purchase a new SIM each time they wanted to churn back to an operator.

=== SIM-only ===
Commonly sold as a product by mobile telecommunications companies, &quot;SIM-only&quot; refers to a type of legally liability contract between a mobile network provider and a customer. The contract itself takes the form of a credit agreement and is subject to a credit check.

SIM-only contracts can be &quot;pre-pay&quot; - where the subscriber buys &quot;credit&quot; before use (often called pay as you go, abbreviated to PAYG), or &quot;post-pay&quot;, where the subscriber pays in arrears, typically monthly.

Within a SIM-only contract, the mobile network provider supplies their customer with just one piece of hardware, a SIM card, which includes an agreed amount of network usage in exchange for a monthly payment. Network usage within a SIM-only contract can be measured in minutes, text, data or any combination of these. The duration of a SIM-only contract varies depending on the deal selected by the customer, but in the UK they are typically available over 1, 3, 6, 12 or 24-month periods.

SIM-only contracts differ from mobile phone contracts in that they do not include any hardware other than a SIM card. In terms of network usage, SIM-only is typically more cost-effective than other contracts because the provider does not charge more to offset the cost of a mobile device over the contract period. The short contract length is one of the key features of SIM-only made possible by the absence of a mobile device.

SIM-only is increasing in popularity very quickly. In 2010 pay monthly based mobile phone subscriptions grew from 41 percent to 49 percent of all UK mobile phone subscriptions. According to German research company GfK, 250,000 SIM-only mobile contracts were taken up in the UK during July 2012 alone, the highest figure since GfK began keeping records.

Increasing smartphone penetration combined with financial concerns is leading customers to save money by moving onto a SIM-only when their initial contract term is over.

== Multiple-SIM devices ==
Dual SIM devices have two SIM card slots for the use of two SIM cards, from one or multiple carriers. Multiple SIM devices are commonplace in developing markets such as in Africa, East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia, where variable billing rates, network coverage and speed make it desirable for consumers to use multiple SIMs from competing networks. Dual-SIM phones are also useful to separate one&#x27;s personal phone number from a business phone number, without having to carry multiple devices. Some popular devices, such as the BlackBerry KeyOne, have dual-SIM variants; however, dual-SIM devices were not common in the US or Europe due to lack of demand. This has changed with mainline products from Apple and Google featuring either two SIM slots or a combination of a physical SIM slot and an eSIM.

In September 2018, Apple introduced iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR featuring Dual SIM (nano-SIM and eSIM) and Apple Watch Series 4 featuring Dual eSIM.

== Thin SIM==

A thin SIM (or overlay SIM or SIM overlay) is a very thin device shaped like a SIM card, approximately 120 microns ( inch) thick. It has contacts on its front and back. It is used by placing it on top of a regular SIM card. It provides its own functionality while passing through the functionality of the SIM card underneath. It can be used to bypass the mobile operating network and run custom applications, particularly on non-programmable cell phones.

Its top surface is a connector that connects to the phone in place of the normal SIM. Its bottom surface is a connector that connects to the SIM in place of the phone. With electronics, it can modify signals in either direction, thus presenting a modified SIM to the phone, and/or presenting a modified phone to the SIM. (It is a similar concept to the Game Genie, which connects between a game console and a game cartridge, creating a modified game). Similar devices have also been developed for iPhones to circumvent SIM card restrictions on carrier-locked models.

In 2014, Equitel, an MVNO operated by Kenya&#x27;s Equity Bank, announced its intention to begin issuing thin SIMs to customers, raising security concerns by competition, particularly concerning the safety of mobile money accounts. However, after months of security testing and legal hearings before the country&#x27;s Parliamentary Committee on Energy, Information and Communications, the Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK) gave the bank the green light to roll out its thin SIM cards.

<text>The Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628–1691), more formally the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, was an English settlement on the east coast of North America around Massachusetts Bay, one of the several colonies later reorganized as the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The lands of the settlement were in southern New England, with initial settlements on two natural harbors and surrounding land about apart—the areas around Salem and Boston, north of the previously established Plymouth Colony. The territory nominally administered by the Massachusetts Bay Colony covered much of central New England, including portions of Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.

The Massachusetts Bay Colony was founded by the owners of the Massachusetts Bay Company, including investors in the failed Dorchester Company, which had established a short-lived settlement on Cape Ann in 1623. The colony began in 1628 and was the company&#x27;s second attempt at colonization. It was successful, with about 20,000 people migrating to New England in the 1630s. The population was strongly Puritan and was governed largely by a small group of leaders strongly influenced by Puritan teachings. It was the first slave-holding colony in New England, and its governors were elected by an electorate limited to freemen who had been formally admitted to the local church. As a consequence, the colonial leadership showed little tolerance for other religious views, including Anglican, Quaker, and Baptist theologies.

The colonists had good relationships with the local Native Americans; however, they did join their neighbor colonies in the Pequot War (1636–1638) and King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1678). After that, most of the Indians in southern New England made peace treaties with the colonists or were sold into slavery after King Philip&#x27;s War (apart from the Pequot tribe, whose survivors were largely absorbed into the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes following the Pequot War).

The Massachusetts Bay Colony was economically successful, trading with England, Mexico, and the West Indies. In addition to barter, transactions were done in English pounds, Spanish &quot;pieces of eight&quot;, and wampum in the 1640s. In 1652, a currency shortage prompted the colony to authorize silversmith John Hull to issue coinage, now known as the oak tree, willow tree, and pine tree shillings.

Political differences with England after the English Restoration led to the revocation of the colonial charter in 1684. King James II established the Dominion of New England in 1686 to bring all of the New England colonies under firmer crown control. The Dominion collapsed after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 deposed James, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony reverted to rule under its revoked charter until 1691, when a new charter was issued for the Province of Massachusetts Bay. This new province combined the Massachusetts Bay territories with those of the Plymouth Colony and proprietary holdings on Nantucket and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Sir William Phips arrived in 1692 bearing the charter and formally took charge of the new province, when the colony, beginning in Salem Village, was coming to grips with the witch trials crises.

==History==

Before the arrival of European colonists on the eastern shore of New England, the area around Massachusetts Bay was the territory of several Algonquian-speaking peoples, including the Massachusetts, Nausets, and Wampanoags. The Pennacooks occupied the Merrimack River valley to the north, and the Nipmucs, Pocumtucs, and Mahicans occupied the western lands of Massachusetts, although some of those tribes were under tribute to the Mohawks, who were expanding aggressively from upstate New York. The total Indigenous population in 1620 has been estimated to be 7,000. This number was significantly larger as late as 1616; in later years, contemporaneous chroniclers interviewed Indigenous people who described a major pestilence which killed as many as two-thirds of the population. The land-use patterns of the Indigenous people included plots cleared for agricultural purposes and woodland territories for hunting game. Land divisions among the tribes were well understood.

During the early 17th century, several European explorers charted the area, including Samuel de Champlain and John Smith. Plans began in 1606 for the first permanent British settlements on the east coast of North America. On April 10, 1606, King James I of England granted a charter forming two joint-stock companies. Neither of these corporations was given a name by this charter, but the territories were named as the &quot;first Colony&quot; and &quot;second Colony&quot;, over which they were respectively authorized to settle and to govern. Under this charter, the &quot;first Colony&quot; and the &quot;second Colony&quot; were to be ruled by a Council composed of 13 individuals in each colony. The charter provided for an additional council of 13 persons named &quot;Council of Virginia&quot; which had overarching responsibility for the combined enterprise.

The &quot;first Colony&quot; ranged from the 34th- to 41st-degree latitude north; the &quot;second Colony&quot; ranged from the 38th- to 45th-degree latitude. (The &quot;first Colony&quot; and the &quot;second Colony&quot; overlapped. The 1629 charter of King Charles I asserted that the second Colony ranged from 40th to 48th degrees north latitude, which reduced the overlap.) Investors from London were appointed to govern over any settlements in the &quot;first Colony&quot;; investors from the &quot;Town of Plimouth in the County of Devon&quot; were appointed to govern over any settlements in the &quot;second Colony&quot;. The London Company proceeded to establish Jamestown. The Plymouth Company under the guidance of Sir Ferdinando Gorges covered the more northern area, including New England, and established the Sagadahoc Colony in 1607 in Maine. The experience proved exceptionally difficult for the 120 settlers, however, and the surviving colonists abandoned the colony after only one year. Gorges noted that &quot;there was no more speech of settling plantations in those parts&quot; for a number of years. English ships continued to come to the New England area for fishing and trade with the Indigenous population.

===Plymouth Colony===

In December 1620, a group of English religious Separatists, later referred to as &quot;the Pilgrims&quot;, established Plymouth Colony just to the south of Massachusetts Bay, seeking to preserve their cultural identity and attain religious freedom. Plymouth&#x27;s colonists faced great hardships and earned few profits for their investors, who sold their interests to them in 1627. Edward Winslow and William Bradford were two of the colony&#x27;s leaders and were likely the authors of a work published in England in 1622 called &quot;Mourt&#x27;s Relation&quot;. This book in some ways resembles a promotional tract intended to encourage further immigration. Plymouth Colony would remain separate from Massachusetts Bay Colony until the creation of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.

===Wessagusett Colony===

There were other attempts at colonies more closely tied to England in 1623 and 1624 at Weymouth, Massachusetts. Thomas Weston&#x27;s Wessagusset Colony failed in under a year. An effort by Robert Gorges to establish an overarching civil and religious colonial structure for New England based in the same location likewise failed and most of the settlers left. Those families who remained after the departure of Gorges formed a permanent settlement the oldest in what would become Massachusetts Bay Colony.

===Cape Ann settlement===

In 1623, the Plymouth Council for New England, the successor to the Plymouth Company, established a small fishing village at Cape Ann under the supervision of the Dorchester Company, with Thomas Gardner as its overseer. This company was originally organized through the efforts of Puritan minister John White (1575–1648) of Dorchester, in the English county of Dorset. White has been called &quot;the father of the Massachusetts Colony&quot; because of his influence in establishing this settlement, even though he never emigrated. The Cape Ann settlement was not profitable, and the financial backers of the Dorchester Company terminated their support by the end of 1625. Their settlement was abandoned at present-day Gloucester, but a few settlers remained in the area, including Roger Conant, establishing a settlement a little further south at what is now Salem, near the village of the Naumkeag tribe.

===Legal formation of the colony===
Archbishop William Laud was a favorite advisor of King Charles I and a dedicated Anglican, and he sought to suppress the religious practices of Puritans and other nonconforming beliefs in England. The persecution of many Puritans in the 1620s led them to believe that religious reform would not be possible while Charles was king, and many decided to seek a new life in the New World.

John White continued to seek funding for a colony. On 19 March 1628 ,&lt;ref name=&quot;OS/NS&quot;&gt;Dates in this article are in the Julian calendar, which was then in use in England. The new year in that calendar fell on Lady Day, March 25, so dates between January 1 and March 25 are written with both years to avoid confusion.&lt;/ref&gt; the Council for New England issued a land grant to a new group of investors that included a few from the Dorchester Company. The land grant was for territory between the Charles River and Merrimack River that extended from &quot;the Atlantick and westerne sea and ocean on the east parte, to the South sea on the west parte&quot;. The company to whom the grant was sold was styled &quot;The New England Company for a Plantation in Massachusetts Bay&quot;. The company elected Matthew Cradock as its first governor and immediately began organizing provisions and recruiting settlers.

The company sent approximately 100 new settlers with provisions to join Conant in 1628, led by Governor&#x27;s Assistant John Endecott, one of the grantees. The next year, Naumkeag was renamed Salem and fortified by another 300 settlers led by Rev. Francis Higginson, one of the first ministers of the settlement. The first winters were difficult, with colonists struggling against starvation and disease, resulting in numerous deaths.

The company leaders sought a royal charter for the colony because they were concerned about the legality of conflicting land claims given to several companies (including the New England Company) for the little-known territories of the New World, and because of the increasing number of Puritans who wanted to join them. Charles granted the new charter on 4 March 1629 [O.S. 1628], superseding the land grant and establishing a legal basis for the new English colony at Massachusetts, appointing Endecott as governor. It was not apparent whether Charles knew that the company was meant to support the Puritan emigration, and he was likely left to assume that it was purely for business purposes, as was the custom. The charter omitted a significant clause: the location for the annual stockholders&#x27; meeting. Charles dissolved Parliament in 1629, whereupon the company&#x27;s directors met to consider the possibility of moving the company&#x27;s seat of governance to the colony. This was followed later that year by the Cambridge Agreement, in which a group of investors agreed to emigrate and work to buy out others who would not emigrate.

The Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first English chartered colony whose board of governors did not reside in England. This independence helped the settlers to maintain their Puritan religious practices without interference from the king, Archbishop Laud, or the Anglican Church of England. The charter remained in force for 55 years; Charles II revoked it in 1684. Parliament passed legislation collectively called the Navigation Acts which attempted to prevent the colonists from trading with any nation other than England. Colonial resistance to those acts led King Charles to revoke the Massachusetts charter and consolidate all the colonies in New England, New York, and New Jersey into the Dominion of New England.

Territory claimed but never administered by the colonial government extended theoretically as far west as the Pacific Ocean. The Dutch colony of New Netherland disputed many of its territorial claims, arguing that they held rights to land beyond Rhode Island up to the western side of Cape Cod, under the jurisdiction of Plymouth Colony at the time.

===Colonial history===

A flotilla of ships sailed from England beginning in April 1630, sometimes known as the Winthrop Fleet. They began arriving at Salem in June and carried more than 700 colonists, Governor John Winthrop, and the colonial charter. Winthrop delivered his famous sermon &quot;City upon a Hill&quot; either before or during the voyage.

Over the next ten years, about 20,000 Puritans emigrated from England to Massachusetts and the neighboring colonies during the Great Migration. Many ministers reacted to the repressive religious policies of England, making the trip with their congregations, among whom were John Cotton, Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and others. Religious divisions and the need for additional land prompted a number of new settlements that resulted in Connecticut Colony (by Hooker) and the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (by Williams and others). Minister John Wheelwright was banished after the Antinomian controversy (like Anne Hutchinson), and he moved north to found Exeter, New Hampshire.
The advent of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in 1639 brought a halt to major migration, and a significant number of men returned to England to fight in the war. Massachusetts authorities were sympathetic to the Parliamentary cause and had generally positive relationships with the governments of the English Commonwealth and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. The colony&#x27;s economy began to diversify in the 1640s, as the fur trading, lumber, and fishing industries found markets in Europe and the West Indies, and the colony&#x27;s shipbuilding industry developed. The growth of a generation of people born in the colony and the rise of a merchant class began to slowly change the political and cultural landscape of the colony, even though its governance continued to be dominated by relatively conservative Puritans.

Colonial support for the Commonwealth created tension after the throne was restored to Charles II in 1660. Charles sought to extend royal influence over the colonies, which Massachusetts resisted along with the other colonies. For example, the Massachusetts Bay colony repeatedly refused requests by Charles and his agents to allow the Church of England to become established, and the New England colonies generally resisted the Navigation Acts, laws that restricted colonial trade to England alone.

The New England colonies were ravaged by King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–76), when the Indigenous peoples of southern New England rose up against the colonists and were decisively defeated, although at great cost in life to all concerned. The Massachusetts frontier was particularly hard hit: several communities in the Connecticut and Swift River valleys were abandoned. By the end of the war, most of the Indigenous population of southern New England made peace treaties with the colonists.

===Confrontation with England===
England had difficulty enforcing its laws and regulations in the Massachusetts Bay colony, as it was a joint-stock colony which was unlike the royal colonies and proprietary colonies that the English crown administered. Massachusetts Bay was largely self-governing with its own house of deputies, governor, and other self-appointed officers. The colony also did not keep its headquarters and oversight in London but moved them to the colony. The Massachusetts Bay colonists viewed themselves as something apart from their &quot;mother country&quot; of England because of this tradition of self-rule, coupled with the theocratic nature of New England Puritan society. The Puritan founders of Massachusetts and Plymouth saw themselves as having been divinely given their lands in the New World with a duty to implement and observe religious law.

English colonists took control of New Netherland in 1664, and the crown sent royal commissioners to New England from the new Province of New York to investigate the status of the government and legal system of the colonies. These commissioners were to bring the New England colonies into a stronger connection with England, including allowing the crown to nominate the governor of the colony. The New England colonists refused, claiming that the King had no right to &quot;supervise&quot; Massachusetts Bay&#x27;s laws and courts, and saying that they ought to continue as they were so long as they remained within the legal rights and privileges of their charter. The Commissioners asked that the colony pay its obligated 20 percent of all gold and silver found in New England, but the colonists responded that they were &quot;not obligated to the king but by civility&quot;.
Massachusetts Bay extended the right to vote only to Puritans, but the population of the colony was increasing and the non-Puritan population was growing along with it; thus, tensions and conflicts were growing concerning the future direction of the colony. Many wealthy merchants and colonists wished to expand their economic base and commercial interests and saw the conservative Puritan leadership as thwarting that. Even in Puritan society, the younger generation wished to liberalize society in a way that would help with commerce. Those who wanted Massachusetts Bay and New England to be a place for religious observance and theocracy were most hostile to any change in governance. The Crown learned of these divisions and sought to include non-Puritans in the leadership in the hope of managing the colony.

The charges of insubordination against the colony included denying the crown&#x27;s authority to legislate in New England, asserting that Massachusetts Bay was governing in the Province of New Hampshire and Maine, and denying freedom of conscience. However, chief among the colonists&#x27; transgressions were the coining of money (the pine tree shilling) and their violations of the Navigation Acts, which had been passed by Parliament to regulate trade within the English colonial empire. These regulations determined whom the colonies could trade with and how trade could be conducted, and New England merchants were flaunting them by trading directly with European powers. This infuriated many English merchants, commercial societies, and Royal committees who petitioned the King for action, claiming that the New England colonists were hurting their trade. The Lords of Trade&#x27;s complaints were so serious that the King sent Edward Randolph to Boston in an attempt to rein in and regulate the colony. When he arrived in Boston, he found a colonial government that refused to give in to the royal demands.

Randolph reported to London that the General Court of Massachusetts Bay claimed that the King had no right to interfere with their commercial dealings. In response, Randolph asked the crown to cut off all trade to and from the colony and asked that further regulations be put in place. The crown did not wish to enforce such a harsh measure and risk alienating the moderate members of New England society who supported England, so the British offered conciliatory measures if Massachusetts Bay followed the law. Massachusetts Bay refused, and the Lords of Trade became wary of the colony&#x27;s charter; they petitioned the crown to either revoke it or amend it. Randolph was made head of Customs and Surveyor General of New England, with his office in Boston. Despite this increased pressure, the General Court established laws that allowed merchants to circumvent Randolph&#x27;s authority. Adding to Randolph&#x27;s frustration was his reliance on the Admiralty Court to rule on the laws that he was attempting to enforce. The moderate faction of the General Court was supportive of Randolph and the changes that the crown wished to make, but the conservatives remained too powerful and blocked any attempt to side with England. However, as the tensions mounted between the crown and Massachusetts Bay, and threats mounted of legal action against the colony, the General Court did pass laws that acknowledged certain English admiralty laws while still making allowance for self-governance.

====Revocation of the charter====
Two delegates from Massachusetts Bay were sent to London to meet with the Lords of Trade when the crown threatened the colony with a &quot;quo warranto&quot;. The Lords demanded a supplementary charter to alleviate problems, but the delegates were under orders that they could not negotiate any change with the Charter and this enraged the Lords. The &quot;quo warranto&quot; was issued immediately. The King feared that this would stir problems within the colony and attempted to reassure the colonists that their private interests would not be infringed upon. The declaration did create problems, however, and the confrontations increased between the moderates and conservatives. The moderates controlled the office of the Governor and the Council of Assistants, and the conservatives controlled the Assembly of Deputies. This political turmoil ended in a compromise with the deputies voting to allow the delegates in London to negotiate and defend the colonial charter.

When the warrant arrived in Boston, the General Court voted on what course the colony should take. The two options were to immediately submit to royal authority and dismantle their government or to wait for the crown to revoke their charter and install a new governmental system. The General Court decided to wait out the crown. They lacked a legal basis to continue their government, yet it remained intact until its official revocation in 1686.

===Unifications and restoration===
James II of England united Massachusetts with the other New England colonies in the Dominion of New England in 1686. The dominion was governed by Sir Edmund Andros without any local representation beyond his own hand-picked councillors, and it was extremely unpopular throughout New England. Massachusetts authorities arrested Andros in April 1689 after the 1688 Glorious Revolution in England, and they re-established government under the forms of the vacated charter. However, dissenters from the Puritan rule argued that the government lacked a proper constitutional foundation, and some of its actions were resisted on that basis.

King William III issued a charter in 1691, despite efforts by Massachusetts agents to revive the old colonial charter. It was chiefly negotiated by Increase Mather in his role as the colony&#x27;s ambassador-extraordinary, unifying Massachusetts Bay with Plymouth Colony, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket, and territories that roughly encompass Maine, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay. This new charter additionally extended voting rights to non-Puritans, an outcome that Mather had tried to avoid.

==Life==

Life could be quite difficult in the early years of the colony. Many colonists lived in fairly crude structures, including dugouts, wigwams, and dirt-floor huts made using wattle and daub construction. Construction improved in later years, and houses began to be sheathed in clapboard, with thatch or plank roofs and wooden chimneys. Wealthier individuals would extend their house by adding a lean-to on the back, which allowed a larger kitchen (possibly with a brick or stone chimney including an oven), additional rooms, and a sleeping loft. These houses were the precursors to what is now called the saltbox style of architecture. Interiors became more elaborate in later years, with plaster walls, wainscoting, and potentially expensive turned woodwork in the most expensive homes.

Colonists arriving after the first wave found that the early towns did not have room for them. Seeking land of their own, groups of families would petition the government for land on which to establish a new town; the government would typically allow the group&#x27;s leaders to select the land. These grants were typically about , and were located sufficiently near other towns to facilitate defense and social support. The group leaders would also be responsible for acquiring native title to the lands that they selected. By this means, the colony expanded into the interior, spawning settlements in adjacent territories as well.

The land within a town would be divided by communal agreement, usually allocating by methods that originated in England. Outside a town center, land would be allocated for farming, some of which might be held communally. Farmers with large plots of land might build a house near their properties on the outskirts of the town. A town center that was well laid out would be fairly compact, with a tavern, school, possibly some small shops, and a meeting house that was used for civic and religious functions. The meeting house would be the center of the town&#x27;s political and religious life. Church services might be held for several hours on Wednesday and all day Sunday. Puritans did not observe annual holidays, especially Christmas, which they said had pagan roots. Annual town meetings would be held at the meeting house, generally in May, to elect the town&#x27;s representatives to the general court and to transact other community business. Towns often had a village green, used for outdoor celebrations and activities such as military exercises of the town&#x27;s trainband or militia.

===Marriage and family life===
Many of the early colonists who migrated from England came with some or all of their family. It was expected that individuals would marry fairly young and begin producing offspring. Infant mortality rates were comparatively low, as were instances of childhood death. Men who lost their wives often remarried fairly quickly, especially if they had children needing care. Older widows would also sometimes marry for financial security. It was also normal for older widowed parents to live with one of their children. Due to the Puritan perception of marriage as a civil union, divorce did sometimes occur and could be pursued by both genders.

Sexual activity was expected to be confined to marriage. Sex outside of marriage was considered fornication if neither partner was married, and adultery if one or both were married to someone else. Fornication was generally punished by fines and pressure to marry; a woman who gave birth to an illegitimate child could also be fined. Adultery and rape were more serious crimes, and both were punishable by death. Rape, however, required more than one witness, and was therefore rarely prosecuted. Sexual activity between men was called sodomy, and was also punishable by death.

Within the marriage, the husband was typically responsible for supplying the family&#x27;s financial needs, although it was not uncommon for women to work in the fields and to perform some home labor (for example, spinning thread or weaving cloth) to supplement the family income. Women were almost exclusively responsible for seeing to the welfare of the children.

Children were baptized at the local meeting house within a week of being born. The mother was usually not present because she was still recovering from the birth, and the child&#x27;s name was usually chosen by the father. Names were propagated within the family, and names would be reused when infants died. If an adult died without issue, his (or her) name could be carried on when the siblings of the deceased named children in his or her memory.

Most children received some form of schooling, something which the colony&#x27;s founders believed to be important for forming a proper relationship with God. Towns were obligated to provide education for their children, which was usually satisfied by hiring a teacher of some sort. The quality of these instructors varied, from minimally educated local people to Harvard-educated ministers.

==Government==
The structure of the colonial government changed over the lifetime of the charter. The Puritans established a theocratic government limited to church members, although ministers were barred from holding governmental positions. Winthrop, Dudley, the Rev. John Cotton, and other leaders sought to prevent dissenting religious views, and many were banished because of differing religious beliefs, including Roger Williams of Salem and Anne Hutchinson of Boston, and unrepentant Quakers and Anabaptists. By the mid-1640s, Massachusetts Bay Colony had grown to more than 20,000 inhabitants.

The charter granted the general court the authority to elect officers and to make laws for the colony. Its first meeting in North America was held in October 1630, but it was attended by only eight freemen. They formed the first council of assistants and voted (contrary to the terms of the charter) that they should elect the governor and deputy from among themselves. The general court determined at the next session that it would elect the governor and deputy.

An additional 116 settlers were admitted to the general court as freemen in 1631, but most of the governing and judicial power remained with the council of assistants. They also enacted a law specifying that only those men who &quot;are members of some of the churches&quot; in the colony were eligible to become freemen and gain the vote. This restriction was not changed until after the English Restoration. The process by which individuals became members of one of the colony&#x27;s churches involved a detailed questioning by the church elders of their beliefs and religious experiences; as a result, only individuals whose religious views accorded with those of the church leadership were likely to become members and gain the ability to vote in the colony. After a protest over the imposition of taxes by a meeting of the council of assistants, the general court ordered each town to send two representatives known as deputies to meet with the court to discuss matters of taxation.

Questions of governance and representation arose again in 1634 when several deputies demanded to see the charter, which the assistants had kept hidden from public view. The deputies learned of the provisions that the general court should make all laws, and that all freemen should be members of the general court. They then demanded that the charter be enforced to the letter, which Governor Winthrop pointed out was impractical given the growing number of freemen. The parties reached a compromise and agreed that the general court would be made up of two deputies representing each town. Dudley was elected governor in 1634, and the general court reserved a large number of powers for itself, including those of taxation, distribution of land, and the admission of freemen.

A legal case in 1642 brought about the separation of the council of assistants into an upper house of the general court. The case involved a widow&#x27;s lost pig and had been overturned by the general court, but the assistants voted as a body to veto the general court&#x27;s act. The consequence of the ensuing debate was that the general court voted in 1644 that the council of assistants would sit and deliberate separately from the general court (they had sat together until then), and both bodies must concur for any legislation to be passed. Judicial appeals were to be decided by a joint session, since otherwise the assistants would be in the position to veto attempts to overturn their own decisions.

The King and the British government held enough power in Massachusetts Bay in the 1630s that Puritans and others were afraid of being sent home if they got word of unorthodox beliefs such as what Roger Williams expounded.

===Laws and judiciary===

During 1641, the colony formally adopted the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, which Nathaniel Ward compiled. This document consisted of 100 civil and criminal laws based upon the social sanctions recorded in the Bible. These laws formed the nucleus of colonial legislation until independence and contained some provisions later incorporated into the United States Constitution, such as the ideas of equal protection and double jeopardy.

Massachusetts Bay was the first colony to formalize laws concerning slavery with provision 91 of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties which developed protections for people unable to perform public service. Another law was developed to protect married women, children, and people with mental disabilities from making financial decisions. Colonial law differentiated among types of mental disabilities, classifying them as &quot;distracted persons&quot;, &quot;idiots&quot;, and &quot;lunaticks&quot;. In 1693, &quot;poor laws&quot; enabled communities to use the estates of people with disabilities to defer the cost of community support of those individuals. Many of these laws remained until the American Revolution.

Many behaviors were frowned upon culturally which modern sensibilities might consider relatively trivial actions, and some led to criminal prosecution. These included sleeping during church services, playing cards, and engaging in any number of activities on the Sabbath. Conversely, there were laws which reflected attitudes that are still endorsed by popular sensibilities in the 21st century US, against things such as smoking tobacco, abusing one&#x27;s mother-in-law, profane dancing, and pulling hair. Children, newcomers, and people with disabilities were exempt from punishment for such infractions.

The colony&#x27;s council of assistants sat as the final court of appeal and as the principal court for criminal issues of &quot;life, limb, or banishment&quot; and civil issues where the damages exceeded £100. Lesser offenses were heard in county courts or by commissioners appointed for hearing minor disputes. The lower courts were also responsible for issuing licenses and for matters such as probate. Juries were authorized to decide questions of both fact and law, although the court could decide if a jury failed to reach a decision. Sentences for offenses included fines and corporal punishments such as whipping and sitting in the stocks, with the punishments of banishment from the colony and death by hanging reserved for the most serious offenses. Evidence was sometimes based on hearsay and superstition. For example, the &quot;ordeal of touch&quot; was used in 1646 in which someone accused of murder is forced to touch the dead body; if blood appears, the accused is deemed guilty. This was used to convict and execute a woman accused of murdering her newborn child. Bodies of individuals hanged for piracy were sometimes gibbeted (publicly displayed) on harbor islands visible to seagoing vessels.

===Notable criminal prosecutions===

One of the first to be executed in the colony was Dorothy Talbye, who was apparently delusional. She was hanged in 1638 for murdering her daughter, as the common law of Massachusetts made no distinction at the time between insanity or mental illness and criminal behavior. Midwife Margaret Jones was convicted of being a witch and hanged in 1648 after the condition of patients allegedly worsened in her care.

The colonial leadership was the most active in New England in the persecution of Quakers. In 1660, English Quaker Mary Dyer was hanged in Boston for repeatedly defying a law banning Quakers from the colony. Dyer was one of the four executed Quakers known as the Boston martyrs. Executions ceased in 1661 when King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism.

===New England Confederation===

In 1643, Massachusetts Bay joined Plymouth Colony, Connecticut Colony, and New Haven Colony in the New England Confederation, a loose coalition organized primarily to coordinate military and administrative matters among the Puritan colonies. It was most active in the 1670s during King Philip&#x27;s War. (New Hampshire had not yet been organized as a separate province, and both it and Rhode Island were excluded because they were not Puritan.)

==Economy and trade==
In the 1600s, the colony was highly dependent on imports from England and was supported by the investments of a number of wealthy immigrants. Certain businesses were quick to thrive, notably shipbuilding, fisheries, and the fur and lumber trades. As early as 1632, ships built in the colony began trading with other colonies, England, and foreign ports in Europe. By 1660, the colony&#x27;s merchant fleet was estimated at 200 ships and, by the end of the century, its shipyards were estimated to turn out several hundred ships annually. In the early years, the fleet principally carried fish to destinations from the West Indies to Europe. It was common for a merchant to ship dried fish to Portugal or Spain, pick up wine and oil for transport to England, and then carry finished goods from England or elsewhere back to the colony. This and other patterns of trade became illegal following the introduction of the Navigation Acts in 1651, turning colonial merchants who continued these trading patterns into &quot;de facto&quot; smugglers. Many colonial authorities were merchants or were politically dependent on them, and they opposed being required by the crown to collect duties imposed by those acts. In 1652, Massachusetts General Court authorized John Hull and Robert Sanderson to begin producing coinage for the colony.

The fur trade only played a modest role in the colony&#x27;s economy because its rivers did not connect its centers well with the Indians who engaged in fur trapping. Timber began to take on an increasingly important role in the economy, especially for naval purposes, after conflicts between England and the Dutch depleted England&#x27;s supplies of ship masts.

The colony&#x27;s economy depended on the success of its trade, in part because its land was not as suitable for agriculture as that of other colonies such as Virginia, where large plantations could be established. The fishery was important enough that those involved in it were exempted from taxation and military service. Larger communities supported craftsmen skilled in providing many of the necessities of 17th century life. Some income-producing activities took place in the home, such as carding, spinning, and weaving of wool and other fibers.

Goods were transported to local markets over roads that were sometimes little more than widened Indian trails. Towns were required to maintain their roads, on penalty of fines, and the colony required special town commissions to lay out roads in a more sensible manner in 1639. Bridges were fairly uncommon, since they were expensive to maintain, and fines were imposed on their owners for the loss of life or goods if they failed. Consequently, most river crossings were made by ferry. Notable exceptions were a bridge across the Mystic River constructed in 1638, and another over the Saugus River, whose upkeep costs were subsidized by the colony.

The colonial government attempted to regulate the economy in a number of ways. On several occasions, it passed laws regulating wages and prices of economically important goods and services, but most of these initiatives did not last very long. The trades of shoe-making and coopering (barrel-making) were authorized to form guilds, making it possible to set price, quality, and expertise levels for their work. The colony set standards governing the use of weights and measures. For example, mill operators were required to weigh grain before and after milling, to ensure that the customer received back what he delivered (minus the miller&#x27;s percentage).

The Puritan dislike of ostentation led the colony to also regulate expenditures on what it perceived as luxury items. Items of personal adornment, particularly lace and costly silk outerwear, were frowned about. Attempts to ban these items failed, and the colony resorted to laws restricting their display to those who could demonstrate £200 in assets.

==Demographics==
Most of the people who arrived during the first 12 years emigrated from two regions of England. Many of the colonists came from the county of Lincolnshire and East Anglia, northeast of London, and a large group also came from Devon, Somerset, and Dorset in the southwest of England. These areas provided the bulk of the migration, although colonists also came from other regions of England. The pattern of migration often centered around specific Nonconformist clergy who sought to leave England under threat from Archbishop Laud, who encouraged their flock to accompany them. One characteristic unique to the New England colonies (as distinguished from some of the other English colonies) was that most of the immigrants were emigrating for religious and political reasons, rather than economic ones.

The preponderance of the immigrants were well-to-do gentry and skilled craftsmen. They brought with them apprentices and servants, the latter of whom were sometimes in indentured servitude. Few titled nobility emigrated, even though some supported the emigration politically and financially and also acquired land holdings in Massachusetts and other colonies. Merchants also represented a significant proportion of the immigrants, often the children of the gentry, and they played an important role in establishing the economy of the colony.

With the start of the English Civil War in 1642, emigration came to a comparative standstill, and some colonists even returned to England to fight for the Parliamentary cause. In the following years, most of the immigrants came for economic reasons; they were merchants, seamen, and skilled craftsmen. Following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the colony also saw an influx of French Protestant Huguenots. During the period of the charter colony, small numbers of Scots immigrated, but these were assimilated into the colony. The population of Massachusetts remained largely English in character until the 1840s.

Slavery existed but was not widespread within the colony. Some Indians captured in the Pequot War were enslaved, with those posing the greatest threat being transported to the West Indies and exchanged for goods and slaves. Governor John Winthrop owned a few Indian slaves, and Governor Simon Bradstreet owned two black slaves. The Body of Liberties enacted in 1641 included rules governing the treatment and handling of slaves. Bradstreet reported in 1680 that the colony had 100 to 120 slaves, but historian Hugh Thomas documents evidence suggesting that there may have been a somewhat larger number. 

==Geography==
The Massachusetts colony was dominated by its rivers and coastline. Major rivers included the Charles and Merrimack, as well as a portion of the Connecticut River, which has been used to transport furs and timbers to Long Island Sound. Cape Ann juts into the Gulf of Maine, providing harbors for fishermen plying the fishing banks to the east, and Boston&#x27;s harbor provided secure anchorage for seagoing commercial vessels. Development in Maine was restricted to coastal areas, and large inland areas remained under native control until after King Philip&#x27;s War, particularly the uplands in what is now Worcester County.

===Boundaries===

The colonial charter specified that the boundaries were to be from three miles (4.8 km) north of the Merrimack River to three miles south of the southernmost point of the Charles River and thence westward to the &quot;South Sea&quot; (i.e., the Pacific Ocean). At the time, the course of neither of the rivers was known for any significant length, which eventually led to boundary disputes with the colony&#x27;s neighbors. The colony&#x27;s claims were large, but the practicalities of the time meant that they never actually controlled any land further west than the Connecticut River valley. The colony also claimed additional lands by conquest and purchase, further extending the territory that it administered.

The southeastern boundary with the Plymouth Colony was first surveyed in 1639 and accepted by both colonies in 1640. It is known in Massachusetts as the &quot;Old Colony Line&quot;, and is still visible as the boundary between Norfolk County to the north and Bristol and Plymouth Counties to the south.

The northern boundary was originally thought to be roughly parallel to the latitude of the mouth of the Merrimack River, since the river was assumed to flow primarily west. This was found not to be the case and, in 1652, Governor Endicott sent a survey party to locate the northernmost point on the Merrimack. At the point where the Pemigewasset River, the Merrimack&#x27;s principal tributary, meets the Winnipesaukee River local Indians guided the party to the outlet of Lake Winnipesaukee, incorrectly claiming that as the Merrimack&#x27;s source. The survey party carved lettering into a rock there (now called Endicott Rock), and its latitude was taken to be the colony&#x27;s northern boundary. When extended eastward, this line was found to meet the Atlantic near Casco Bay in present-day Maine.

Following this discovery, the colonial magistrates began proceedings to bring existing settlements under their authority in southern New Hampshire and Maine. This extension of the colonial claim conflicted with several proprietary grants owned by the heirs of John Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges. The Mason heirs pursued their claims in England, and the result was the formation of the Province of New Hampshire in 1679. The current boundary between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was not fixed until 1741. In 1678, the colony purchased the claims of the Gorges heirs, gaining control over the territory between the Piscataqua and Kennebec Rivers. The colony and later the province and state retained control of Maine until it was granted statehood in 1820.

The colony performed a survey in 1642 to determine its southern boundary west to the Connecticut River. This line, south of the present boundary, was protested by Connecticut, but stood until the 1690s, when Connecticut performed its own survey. Most of today&#x27;s Massachusetts boundaries with its neighbors were fixed in the 18th century. The most significant exception was the eastern boundary with Rhode Island, which required extensive litigation, including Supreme Court rulings, before it was finally resolved in 1862.

Lands which had previously belonged to the Pequots to the southwest were divided after the Pequot War in present-day Rhode Island and eastern Connecticut. Claims were disputed in this area for many years, particularly between Connecticut and Rhode Island. Massachusetts administered Block Island and the area around present-day Stonington, Connecticut, as part of these spoils of war, and was one of several claimants to land in what was known as Narragansett Country (roughly Washington County, Rhode Island). Massachusetts lost these territories in the 1660s, when Connecticut and Rhode Island received their royal charters.

<doc id="197496" wikidata="Q1753019" url="?curid=197496" title="International Superhits!">
<text>International Superhits! is the first greatest hits compilation by American rock band Green Day, released November 13, 2001, through Reprise Records. It collects all of the band&#x27;s singles released between 1994 and 2000 as well as a rerecording of &quot;Maria&quot;, a B-side from &quot;Waiting&quot;, and a previously unreleased track, &quot;Poprocks &amp; Coke&quot;. A DVD and VHS titled International Supervideos! was released simultaneously, collecting fifteen of the band&#x27;s music videos spanning the same period. Both releases have been certified Platinum in the United States for sales of over 1 million copies and 3× Platinum in the United Kingdom for sales of 900,000.

==Reception==

Upon its release, &quot;International Superhits!&quot; charted in ten countries. The album peaked at no. 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and was a success in several other countries, peaking as high as no. 4 in Japan; the lowest peak in any country was in Germany at no. 67. It was certified Gold in Canada eight days after its release, for sales of over 50,000 units. It achieved Gold certification in the United States in January 2002 for sales of over 500,000, and went on to be certified Platinum in 2005 for sales of over 1 million. Also in 2005 it reached no. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Catalog Albums chart. It has also been certified 2× Platinum in the United Kingdom for sales of 852,000, and Triple Platinum in Australia for sales of over 210,000, bringing its worldwide sales to over 2,062,000.

Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a perfect five-star review, saying it &quot;confirms that Green Day not only were popular and good, but they could have held their own against their idols&quot; and that &quot;distilled to their singles, Green Day sound fiercer than ever, and more musically vibrant&quot;. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; rated it four stars out of five, remarking that &quot;Time-tested hits like &#x27;Basket Case&#x27;, &#x27;Brain Stew&#x27;, and &#x27;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&#x27;, along with soundtrack contributions &#x27;J.A.R.&#x27; and &#x27;Nice Guys Finish Last&#x27;, heartily display Green Day&#x27;s remarkable longevity. The album&#x27;s new offering, &#x27;Poprocks &amp; Coke&#x27;, dishes out more of the maturated, acoustic-filled folk-punk that began with &#x27;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&#x27; and &quot;Warning&quot; ... The collection&#x27;s only flaw is the omission of tracks representing the band&#x27;s pre-fame days.&quot;

<doc id="197501" wikidata="Q206091" url="?curid=197501" title="Canyoning">
<text>Canyoning (canyoneering in the United States, kloofing in South Africa) is a sport that involves traveling through canyons using a variety of techniques, such as walking, scrambling, climbing, jumping, abseiling (rappelling), swimming, and rafting.

Although non-technical descents such as hiking down a canyon (&quot;canyon hiking&quot;) are often referred to as &quot;canyoneering&quot;, the terms &quot;canyoning&quot; and &quot;canyoneering&quot; are more often associated with technical descents—those that require rappels and ropework, technical climbing or down-climbing, technical jumps, and/or technical swims.

Canyoning is frequently done in remote and rugged settings and often requires navigational, route-finding, and other wilderness travel skills. 
Canyons that are ideal for canyoning are often cut into the bedrock stone, forming narrow gorges with numerous drops, sculpted walls, and sometimes waterfalls. Most canyons are cut into limestone, sandstone, granite, or basalt, though other rock types are found. Canyons can be very easy or extremely difficult, though emphasis in the sport is usually on aesthetics and fun rather than pure difficulty. A wide variety of canyoning routes are found throughout the world.

Canyoning gear includes climbing hardware, semi-static ropes, helmets, wetsuits, and specially designed shoes, packs, and rope bags. While canyoneers have used and adapted climbing, hiking, and river running gear for years, more and more specialized gear has been developed as the as sport&#x27;s popularity increases.

==Canyoning around the world==
In most parts of the world, canyoning is done in mountain canyons with flowing water. The number of countries with established canyoning outfitters is growing yearly.

===Asia===
Nepal has huge potential for adventurous travellers with activities such as mountaineering, trekking, canyoning, rafting, paragliding, mountain biking, and honey hunting. Canyoning is prominent in Sundarijal (Kathmandu), Sindhupalchowk (Old jambo),Pokhara, Jalabire (Chitwan) among others. Dalat in Vietnam is well known for canyoning and rapelling. In Japan, &quot;kyanioningu&quot; and &quot;sawanobori&quot; are practised, the latter being the sport of climbing up canyons and gorges. In Taiwan, canyoning is practiced alongside a sport called &quot;river tracing&quot; that typically involves travelling upstream. The Philippines has a canyoneering run at Kawasan Falls, Badian, Cebu that is popular among foreign travellers.

===Europe===
Canyoning in the United Kingdom has gained in popularity over recent years. In the UK, Wales, Scotland, Cumbria and Yorkshire and some areas of Cornwall are recognized as the prime locations for this activity. In the Welsh language, canyoning is called &quot;cerdded ceunant&quot;. It is also referred to as &quot;gorge walking&quot; or &quot;ghyllscrambling&quot; which the UK Scout Association defines as &quot;the activity of following a river bed through a gorge. This often includes climbing, swimming, abseiling and scrambling depending upon the environment&quot;.

Ticino, Switzerland, is a popular canyoning destination because of its granite rock, crystal green pools and its pleasant Mediterranean climate. 
Some nice and popular canyoning spots can also be found in Slovenia, Italy and Austria.
Spain has also emerged as a popular canyoning spot, owing to its warm climate and abundance of rock formations conducive to canyoning.
Portugal also has canyoning in the Azores and Madeira.

===North America===
In the United States, descending mountain canyons with flowing water is sometimes referred to as &quot;canyoning&quot;, although the term &quot;canyoneering&quot; is more common. Most canyoneering in the United States occurs in the many slot canyons carved in the sandstone found throughout the Colorado Plateau. Outside of the Colorado Plateau, numerous canyoneering opportunities are found throughout Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, and the Pacific Northwest. Canyons can be found in the San Gabriel, Sierra Nevada, Cascade, and Rocky Mountain ranges. 

In Arizona, there are hundreds of canyons found inside Grand Canyon. Several mountain ranges and wilderness areas such as the Sierra Anchas, Mazatzal Mountains, Santa Catalina, West Fork of Oak Creek, and West Clear Creek Wilderness also have many technical canyons.

===Oceania===
Canyoning is common in Australia in the many sandstone slot canyons of the Blue Mountains National Park, known for their technical abseil starts and lack of fast flowing water.

===Africa===
In South Africa, the term &quot;Kloofing&quot; is used, which is derived from the Afrikaans word &#x27;kloof&#x27;, meaning &#x27;gorge&#x27; or &#x27;ravine&#x27;. It has been adopted by English-speaking people (mostly in southern Africa), to mean the activity described above. The word is used in a similar sense to canyoning and canyoneering. The word (and activity) has been in use in South Africa since about the 1920s and probably earlier.

==Hazards==

Canyoning can be dangerous. Escape via the sides of a canyon is often impossible, and completion of the descent is the only possibility. Due to the remoteness and inaccessibility of many canyons, rescue can be impossible for several hours or several days.

===High water flow / hydraulics===
Canyons with significant water flow may be treacherous and require special ropework techniques for safe travel. Hydraulics, undercurrents, and sieves (or &quot;strainers&quot;) occur in flowing canyons and can trap or pin and drown a canyoneer. A 1993 accident in Zion National Park, Utah, US, in which two leaders of a youth group drowned in powerful canyon hydraulics (and the lawsuit which followed) brought notoriety to the sport.

===Flash floods===
A potential danger of many canyoning trips is a flash flood. A canyon &quot;flashes&quot; when a large amount of precipitation falls in the drainage, and water levels in the canyon rise quickly as the runoff rushes down the canyon. In canyons that drain large areas, the rainfall could be many kilometers away from the canyoners, completely unbeknown to them. A calm or even dry canyon can quickly become a violent torrent due to a severe thunderstorm in the vicinity. Fatalities have occurred as a result of flash floods; in one widely publicized 1999 incident, 21 tourists on a commercial canyoning adventure trip drowned in Saxetenbach Gorge, Switzerland. Authorities in Switzerland have set in the last few years high standards on safety, &quot;Safety in adventures&quot; label is becoming the standard for all companies to prove they are following the standard safety procedures. Some hidden dangers related to flashflood triggering factors needs to be considered, as the hydrophobicity after wildfires. A case study in Spain (Jerte basin) shows how after a wildfire, even during low precipitation events, a flash flood can be generated, increasing peak flow of hydrograph from to with dramatic consequences affecting a guided group of canyoneers and resulting in four deaths.

===Hypothermia and hyperthermia===

Temperature-related illnesses are also canyoning hazards. In arid desert canyons, heat exhaustion can occur if proper hydration levels are not maintained and adequate steps are not taken to avoid the intense rays of the sun. Hypothermia can be a serious danger in &quot;any&quot; canyon that contains water, during &quot;any time&quot; of the year. Wetsuits and drysuits can mitigate this danger to a large degree, but when people miscalculate the amount of water protection they will need, dangerous and sometimes fatal situations can occur. Hypothermia due to inadequate cold water protection is cited as a cause of a 2005 incident in which two college students drowned in a remote Utah canyon.

===Keeper potholes===

Some canyoneering, especially in sandstone slots, involves escaping from large potholes. Also called &quot;keeper potholes,&quot; these features, carved out by falling water at the bottom of a drop in the watercourse, are circular pits that often contain water that is too deep to stand up in and whose walls are too smooth to easily climb out of. Canyoneers use several unique and creative devices to escape potholes, including hooks used for aid climbing attached to long poles and specialized weighted bags that are attached to ropes and tossed over the lip of a pothole.

===Very narrow slots===
Narrow slot canyons, especially those narrower than humans, present difficult obstacles for canyoners. At times a canyoner is forced to climb up (using chimneying or off-width climbing techniques) to a height where one can comfortably manoeuvre laterally with pressure on both walls of the canyon. This tends to be strenuous and can require climbing high above the canyon floor, unprotected, for long periods of time. Failure to complete the required moves could result in being trapped in a canyon where rescue is extremely difficult. Past rescues have required extensive rigging systems and dish soap to extract stuck canyoners.

Narrow sandstone slot canyons tend to have abrasive walls which rip clothing and gear, and can cause painful skin abrasion as a canyoner moves or slides along them.

===Exposure to water-borne diseases===
Immersion in water may lead to exposure to diseases such as Weil&#x27;s Disease (Leptospirosis), dermatitis and gastroenteritis. Ingestion of water should be avoided and taking a shower immediately after canyoning or gorge walking is recommended.

===Rockfall===
Canyons are changing environments and falling rocks, including chockstones, are not uncommon. A moving chockstone caused Aron Ralston&#x27;s 2003 accident where he was forced to amputate his forearm.

===Becoming lost===
Many canyons are located in remote areas with limited or sparse trails, and due to their harsh environments, straying from established areas can be dangerous.

==Education and training==

As the sport of canyoneering grows, there are more and more people looking to learn the skills needed to safely descend canyons. Several reputable organizations are now offering classes of various forms to the public; some organizations are training organizations that offer certifications, while other commercial operations offer classes in addition to purely recreational guided tours. The latter is particularly popular in tourist destinations around the world, such as Costa Rica, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Utah. Most programs have multiple levels of skill-set classes. The lowest levels usually cover the basics such as rappelling, rope work, navigation, identification of gear and clothing, and rappel setups. The higher levels cover more complex situations such as anchor building and strategies on how to descend various types of canyons. Other higher level and specialty classes typically cover rescue situations, wilderness first aid, and swift water canyons.

For professional canyoning guide training there are a number of organisations spread throughout the world. In Europe the CIC (Commission Internationale de Canyon) was one of the first organisations, (formerly CEC) for professionals to teach over multiple countries. ICO Pro (International Canyoning Organisation for Professionals), ICA (International Academy of Canyoning Association) and the ACA (American Canyoneering Association), CGI (Canyon Guides International) all offer training courses in multiple countries. There are also many certification systems governed by single countries, many which are based on the original CEC methodology.

<doc id="197505" wikidata="Q753539" url="?curid=197505" title="Soyuz 7">
<text>Soyuz 7 (, &quot;Union 7&quot;) was part of an October, 1969, joint mission with Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 8 that saw three Soyuz spacecraft in orbit together at the same time, carrying a total of seven cosmonauts.

The crew consisted of commander Anatoly Filipchenko, flight engineer Vladislav Volkov and research-cosmonaut Viktor Gorbatko, whose mission was to dock with Soyuz 8 and transfer crew, as the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 missions did. Soyuz 6 was to film the operation from nearby.

However, this objective was not achieved due to equipment failures. Soviet sources later claimed that no docking had been intended, but this seems unlikely, given the docking adapters carried by the spacecraft, and the fact that the Soyuz 8 crew were both veterans of the previous successful docking mission. This was the last time that the Soviet crewed Moon landing hardware was tested in orbit, and the failure seems to have been one of the final nails in the coffin of the programme.

The radio call sign of the spacecraft was , meaning &quot;blizzard&quot;, which years later was re-used as the name of the entirely different spaceplane Buran. This word is apparently used as the name of an active or aggressive squadron in Soviet military training, and just like Soyuz 4, the Soyuz 7 spacecraft was constructed to be the active or male spacecraft in its docking.

== Crew ==
=== Backup Crew ===
=== Reserve Crew ===
== Mission parameters ==
* Mass: 
* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 51.65°
* Period: 88.77 minutes

== Mission ==
The mission objectives included:
* checkout the modified structure of the Soyuz craft,
* further improvement of the control, orientation, and orbital stabilisation systems and navigation aids,
* debugging the piloting systems by orbital maneuvering of the spaceships in relation to one another,
* testing of a system for control of the simultaneous flight of three spacecraft,
* scientific observations and photographing of geological-geographical subjects and exploration of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere,
* studying circumterrestrial space,
* conducting experiments of engineering research and biomedical engineering importance.

== Return ==
The ship was involved in group flight with Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 8. Docking did not occur, and the ship landed 5 days after launch, at 155 km at the northwest of Karaganda, Kazakhstan.

<text>Théodore Gardelle (30 November 1722 – 4 April 1761) was a painter and enameller.

He was born in Geneva, then in the independent Republic of Geneva, where he studied portrait miniature painting. Having acquired its first rudiments, he went to Paris in 1744. There he gained great proficiency in the art. He lived there studying and painting until 1750. Then he returned to his native place and practised his profession for some years. In 1756, he again went to Paris. In 1760, he went to England, where he was executed in Haymarket, London, for murdering his landlady Anne King.

<text>Soyuz 8 (, &quot;Union 8&quot;) was part of an October, 1969, joint mission with Soyuz 6 and Soyuz 7 that saw three Soyuz spacecraft in orbit together at the same time, carrying a total of seven cosmonauts.

The crew consisted of commander Vladimir Shatalov and flight engineer Aleksei Yeliseyev, whose mission was to dock with Soyuz 7 and transfer crew, as the Soyuz 4 (involving, among others, these two cosmonauts) and Soyuz 5 missions did. Soyuz 6 was to film the operation from nearby.

However, this objective was not achieved due to equipment failures. Soviet sources were later to claim that no docking had been intended, but this seems unlikely, given the docking adapters carried by the spacecraft, and the fact that both Shatalov and Yeliseyev were veterans of the previous successful docking mission. This was the last time that the Soviet-crewed Moon landing hardware was tested in orbit, and the failure seems to have been one of the final nails in the coffin of the programme.

The radio call sign of the spacecraft was , meaning &quot;Granite&quot;. This word is apparently used as the name of a reactive or defensive squadron in Soviet military training, and, just like the Soyuz 5, it was constructed and its crew was trained to be the responsive (not entirely passive) or female spacecraft in its docking. Giving military names to the spacecraft was probably a response to an appeal that the commander of the Soyuz 5 made. Further, the word was probably chosen as it begins with a letter following that sequence starting with (meaning &quot;Antaeus&quot;) and (meaning &quot;Blizzard&quot;); &quot;Г&quot; (G) is the fourth letter of the Russian alphabet.

== Crew ==
=== Backup Crew ===
== Mission ==
The mission objectives included:
* checkout and flight test of spaceborne systems and the modified structure of the Soyuz craft,
* further improvement of the control, orientation, and orbital stabilisation systems and navigation aids,
* debugging the piloting systems by orbital maneuvering of the spaceships in relation to one another,
* testing of a system for control of the simultaneous flight of three spacecraft,
* scientific observations and photographing of geological-geographical subjects and exploration of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere,
* studying circumterrestrial space,
* conducting experiments of engineering research and biomedical engineering importance.

== Mission parameters ==
* Mass: 
* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 51.65°
* Period: 88.72 minutes

== Return ==
Stable two-way radio communication was maintained between the spaceships and the ground stations, and TV coverage was broadcast from the ships during flight. Soyuz 8 was a part of the group flight of Soyuz 6, 7, and 8, and resembled Soyuz 6 in that it was an active ship designed to move toward the passive Soyuz 7. Soyuz 8 was equipped with full docking apparatus and for some hours flew very close to Soyuz 7. No docking occurred. The flight was safely terminated in Kazakh Steppe, in Kazakhstan.

<text>Bad Company is the debut studio album by Bad Company, a 1970s English hard rock supergroup. The album was recorded at Headley Grange with Ronnie Lane&#x27;s Mobile Studio in November 1973, and it was the first album released on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Swan Song Records label.

Among the songs recorded during the album sessions were two covers of tracks originally by members&#x27; previous bands — specifically, Mott the Hoople&#x27;s &quot;Ready for Love&quot; (recorded while Mick Ralphs was with the band and released on their 1972 album &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;) and &quot;Easy on My Soul&quot; (recorded by Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke with Free and released on &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; in 1973). The latter did not make the final album, but was released as the B-side to second single &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
The album reached the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Since then, the album has been certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and became the 46th best selling album of the 1970s. The album spent 25 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, entering at No. 10 on June 15, 1974, and reaching its highest position of No. 3 in the second week. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at No. 40 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 323 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

The singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; peaked at No. 5 and No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, &quot;Bad Company&quot; and &quot;Ready for Love&quot; are also classic rock radio staples.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Matt Wardlaw named four songs from &quot;Bad Company&quot; – &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Ready for Love&quot; and &quot;Seagull&quot; – to be among Bad Company&#x27;s 10 greatest songs.

==Versions==
The album was remastered and re-released in 1994. In 2006 an audiophile mastered 24K gold CD was released by Audio Fidelity.

<doc id="197514" wikidata="Q1537584" url="?curid=197514" title="Suffer (album)">
<text>Suffer is the third studio album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on September 8, 1988. It was the first album that was both released and distributed by the label. Following the release of the EP &quot;Back to the Known&quot; (1985), Bad Religion went on a temporary hiatus, then reunited with its original members (except drummer Jay Ziskrout) and went to work on their first full-length studio album in five years.

Although &quot;Suffer&quot; did not chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it has been cited by some critics as one of the most important punk rock albums of all time. A plethora of third-wave punk bands cite &quot;Suffer&quot; as a major inspiration, including NOFX&#x27;s Fat Mike, who called it &quot;the record that changed everything.&quot; NOFX later referenced the album with their 2001 EP, &quot;Surfer&quot;.

The songs, &quot;You Are (The Government)&quot;, &quot;1000 More Fools&quot;, &quot;How Much Is Enough?&quot;, &quot;Land of Competition&quot;, &quot;Best For You&quot;, &quot;Suffer&quot;, &quot;What Can You Do?&quot;, and &quot;Do What You Want&quot;, are all fan favorites, and a few of those are staples of their live show. Up until 2018, the only song from &quot;Suffer&quot; that was never performed live was &quot;Part IV (The Index Fossil)&quot; which finally received its live premiere that year at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on May 2nd.

==Background and recording==
After experiencing line-up changes and releasing their second album, &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; (1983), to commercial failure, Bad Religion and their label Epitaph Records called it quits. Vocalist Greg Graffin and drummer Pete Finestone
reformed the band with guitarist Greg Hetson of Circle Jerks, who had guested on their debut album &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; (1982), and bassist Tim Gallegos of Wasted Youth. They released the &quot;Back to the Known&quot; (1985) EP, and after a year of constant touring, Gallegos left and was replaced by former Bad Religion member Jay Bentley, who had also played in Wasted Youth. Some months later, former Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz, who was recovering from drug problems, filled in for Hetson during one show and eventually re-joined the band.

By 1987, Gurewitz struggled to find some kind of employment. After taking some vocational courses and a raft of odd jobs, he became a studio engineer and owner of a recording studio, Westbeach Recorders. Gurewitz noted, &quot;I really enjoyed, still enjoy, being a recording engineer, but I had a terrible time trying to make any money. And my hours were horrible. I just knew I wanted to be in music. Then, in 1987, Bad Religion said, &#x27;Hey man, why don&#x27;t we get the group back together?&quot;. After Bad Religion finally reunited, they began writing new material and entered Westbeach Recorders in April 1988 to record their next album. According to Gurewitz, the album took eight days for the band to record and mix.

During recording sessions, the band even demoed a revamped version of &quot;Fuck Armageddon...This Is Hell&quot;, a track previously released on &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot;. Whether they intended to include the song on &quot;Suffer&quot; is unknown and most unlikely.

Members of L7 played on the record. Donita Sparks and Suzi Gardner played guitar on &quot;Best for You&quot; and Jennifer Finch sang back-up vocals on &quot;Part II (The Numbers Game)&quot;. Epitaph Records was re-started to release the self-titled debut album from L7, prior to issuing &quot;Suffer&quot; that same year.

==Reception and legacy==
The album received critical acclaim. Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;B&quot; saying; &quot;This comeback is hailed as a hardcore milestone, probably because it&#x27;s coherent. Relatively sane as their bitter analysis is—and I mean relative to both hardcore despair and mainstream complacency—it sounds a little pat. As if they&#x27;re already a little slow for speedrock and don&#x27;t want to upset the apple cart.&quot; Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote: &quot;Fast, furious, edgy, insightful lyrics about the state of the world... it all started here. A hint of harmonies, a mass of melodies, &quot;Suffer&quot; marks the true dawn of the band&#x27;s slow rise to stardom.&quot;

In the lead up to the release of their next album, &quot;No Control&quot; (1989), &quot;Suffer&quot; had sold 4,000 copies. The album also received acclaim by the following magazines:
* Alternative Press (3/02, p. 96) – Included in AP&#x27;s &quot;Essential Punk Influences &#x27;02 Style&quot; – &quot;...Their definitive album...they&#x27;d never eclipse this fireball of creative energy.&quot;
* Kerrang! (p. 51) – &quot;[With] sonorous, soaring vocal hooks. The melding of power and melody proved a statement of absolute power.&quot;

In a fan poll, &quot;Do What You Want&quot; was cited as one of the best Bad Religion songs of all time, along with &quot;American Jesus&quot; and &quot;Along The Way.&quot; Rancid&#x27;s Tim Armstrong has said that &quot;What Can You Do?&quot; is his favorite Bad Religion track.

The album was also named the 99th most influential rock album of all time by Kerrang! magazine. It placed at #6 on LA Weekly&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 Punk Albums in History&quot;.

To celebrate its 250th issue, German music magazine Visions asked 250 famous musicians across all genres of rock music to review the one album that musically influenced them the most. Both Fat Mike of NOFX and Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music chose Suffer.

==Artwork==
The album cover features a drawing of a teenager on fire wearing a T-shirt with Bad Religion&#x27;s crossbuster logo, designed by Jerry Mahoney, on the back. The person on the cover has been taken by the band as a mascot; &quot;Boy on Fire&quot; is the name and he can also be seen on Bad Religion accessories, including T-shirts. NOFX paid homage to the cover art on its &quot;Surfer&quot; EP, which depicts a surfer on fire wearing a wetsuit with NOFX&#x27;s &quot;prohibited FX&quot; symbol on the back, at a beach. It was painted by Mark deSalvo.

<doc id="197517" wikidata="Q195154" url="?curid=197517" title="Rachel Corrie">
<text>Rachel Aliene Corrie (April 10, 1979 – March 16, 2003) was an American nonviolence activist and diarist. She was a member of the pro-Palestinian International Solidarity Movement (ISM) and was active throughout the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories. 
In 2003, she was in Rafah, a city in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli military was demolishing Palestinian houses at the height of the Second Intifada. While protesting the demolitions as they were being carried out, she was killed by an Israeli armored bulldozer that crushed her.

Corrie was born in Olympia, Washington, the United States in 1979. After graduating from Capital High School, she went on to attend Evergreen State College. She took a year off from her studies to work as a volunteer in the Washington State Conservation Corps, where she spent three years making weekly visits to mental patients. While at Evergreen State College, she became a &quot;committed peace activist&quot;, arranging peace events through a local group called &quot;Olympians for Peace and Solidarity&quot;. She later joined the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) organization in order to protest the policies of the Israeli army in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 

Corrie went to Gaza as part of her college&#x27;s senior-year independent-study proposal to connect Olympia and Rafah with each other as sister cities. While in Rafah on March 16, 2003, she joined other ISM activists in efforts to nonviolently prevent Israel&#x27;s demolition of Palestinian property, where she was killed by an Israeli bulldozer that crushed her.

Physicians present and fellow ISM activists stated that Corrie had been wearing a high-visibility vest and was deliberately driven over, while the Israeli army said that it was an accident because the bulldozer operator did not see her. 
Following the incident, an Israeli military investigation concluded that Corrie&#x27;s death was the result of an accident and that the bulldozer operator had limited visibility. The ruling attracted criticism from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, B&#x27;Tselem, and Yesh Din. 
HRW stated that the ruling represented a pattern of impunity for Israeli forces.

In 2005, Corrie&#x27;s parents filed a civil lawsuit, charging the Israeli state with not conducting a full and credible investigation into the case and therefore holding responsibility for her death. They contended that either she had been intentionally killed or the Israeli soldiers on scene had acted with reckless neglect. They sued for a symbolic US$1 in damages. However, an Israeli court rejected their suit in August 2012 and upheld the results of the military&#x27;s investigation, ruling that the Israeli government was not responsible for Corrie&#x27;s death, again attracting criticism from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and various activists. An appeal against this ruling was heard on May 21, 2014, but was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court of Israel on February 14, 2015.
==Early life==
Corrie was born on April 10, 1979, and raised in Olympia, Washington, United States. She was the youngest of three children of Craig Corrie, an insurance executive, and Cindy Corrie. Cindy describes their family as &quot;average Americans—politically liberal, economically conservative, middle class&quot;.

After graduating from Capital High School, Corrie went on to attend The Evergreen State College, also in Olympia, where she took a number of arts courses. She took a year off from her studies to work as a volunteer in the Washington State Conservation Corps. According to the ISM, she spent three years making weekly visits to mental patients.

While at Evergreen State College she became a &quot;committed peace activist&quot; arranging peace events through a local pro-ISM group called &quot;Olympians for Peace and Solidarity&quot;. She later joined the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) organisation in order to protest the policies of the Israeli army in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In her senior year, she &quot;proposed an independent-study program in which she would travel to Gaza, join the ISM team, and initiate a &#x27;sister city&#x27; project between Olympia and Rafah&quot;. Before leaving, she also organized a pen-pal program between children in Olympia and Rafah.

==Activities in the Palestinian territories==

=== In the Gaza Strip ===
While in Rafah, Corrie stood in front of armored bulldozers, in an alleged attempt to impede house demolitions which were being carried out. These military operations were criticized as &quot;collective punishment&quot; by some human rights groups. Israel authorities said that demolitions were necessary because &quot;Palestinian gunmen used the structures as cover to shoot at their troops patrolling in the area, or to conceal arms-smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border.&quot; Corrie was a member of a group of about eight activists from outside of the Palestinian territories who tried to prevent the Israeli army&#x27;s activities by acting as human shields.

On Corrie&#x27;s first night there, she and two other ISM members set up camp inside Block J, which the ISM described as &quot;a densely populated neighborhood along the Pink Line and frequent target of gunfire from an Israeli watchtower&quot;. By situating themselves visibly between the Palestinians and the Israeli snipers manning the watchtowers they hoped to discourage shooting by displaying banners stating that they were &quot;internationals&quot;. When Israeli soldiers fired warning shots, Corrie and her colleagues dismantled their tent and left the area.

Qishta, a Palestinian who worked as an interpreter, noted: &quot;Late January and February was a very crazy time. There were house demolitions taking place all over the border strip and the activists had no time to do anything else.&quot; Qishta also stated of the ISM activists: &quot;They were not only brave; they were crazy.&quot; The safety of the protestors was frequently jeopardized by these confrontations— a British participant was wounded by shrapnel while retrieving the body of a Palestinian man killed by a sniper, and an Irish ISM activist had a close encounter with an armored bulldozer.

Palestinian militants expressed concern that the &quot;internationals&quot; staying in tents between the Israeli watchtowers and the residential neighborhoods would get caught in crossfire, while other residents were concerned that the activists might be spies. To overcome this suspicion Corrie learned a few words of Arabic and participated in a mock trial denouncing the &quot;crimes of the Bush Administration&quot;. While the ISM members were eventually provided with food and housing, a letter was circulated in Rafah that cast suspicion on them. &quot;Who are they? Why are they here? Who asked them to come here?&quot; On the morning of Corrie&#x27;s death they planned to counteract the letter&#x27;s effects. According to one of them, &quot;We all had a feeling that our role was too passive. We talked about how to engage the Israeli military.&quot;

==== Water-well protecting efforts ====
According to a January 2003 article by Gordon Murray, a fellow ISM activist, in the last month of her life Corrie &quot;spent a lot of time at the Canada Well helping protect Rafah municipal workers&quot; who were trying to repair damage to the well done by Israeli bulldozers. Canada Well was built in 1999 with CIDA funding. It, along with El Iskan Well, had supplied more than 50% of Rafah&#x27;s water before the damage. The city had been under &quot;strict rationing (only a few hours of running water on alternate days)&quot; since. Murray writes that ISM activists were maintaining a presence there since &quot;Israeli snipers and tanks routinely shot at civilian workers trying to repair the wells.&quot; In one of her reports, Corrie wrote that despite her group&#x27;s having received permission from the Israeli District Command Office and the fact that they were carrying &quot;banners and megaphones the activists and workers were fired upon several times over a period of about one hour. One of the bullets came within two metres of three internationals and a municipal water worker close enough to spray bits of debris in their faces as it landed at their feet.&quot;

==== Burning an American flag while protesting the Iraq War ====
While in Gaza, Corrie took part in a demonstration as part of the February 15, 2003 anti-war protest against the invasion of Iraq. She was photographed burning a makeshift U.S. flag.

After her death the ISM released a statement quoting Corrie&#x27;s parents on the widely circulated picture of the incident:

In the words of Rachel&#x27;s parents: &quot;The act, while we may disagree with it, must be put into context. Rachel was partaking in a demonstration in Gaza opposing the War on Iraq. She was working with children who drew two pictures, one of the American flag, and one of the Israeli flag, for burning. Rachel said that she could not bring herself to burn the picture of the Israeli flag with the Star of David on it, but under such circumstances, in protest over a drive towards war and her government&#x27;s foreign policy that was responsible for much of the devastation that she was witness to in Gaza, she felt it OK to burn the picture of her own flag. We have seen photographs of memorials held in Gaza after Rachel&#x27;s death in which Palestinian children and adults honor our daughter by carrying a mock coffin draped with the American flag. We have been told that our flag has never been treated so respectfully in Gaza in recent years. We believe Rachel brought a different face of the United States to the Palestinian people, a face of compassion. It is this image of Rachel with the American flag that we hope will be remembered most.

==== Corrie&#x27;s emails to her mother ====
Rachel Corrie sent a series of emails to her mother while she was in Gaza, four of which were later published by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In January 2008, Norton published a book titled &quot;Let Me Stand Alone&quot; by Corrie, which included the e-mails along with some of her other writings. Yale Professor David Bromwich said that Corrie left &quot;letters of great interest&quot;. The play &quot;My Name is Rachel Corrie&quot; and the cantata &quot;The Skies are Weeping&quot; were based on Corrie&#x27;s letters.

==Death and subsequent controversy==


On March 16, 2003, the IDF was engaged in an operation involving the demolition of Palestinian houses in Rafah. Corrie was part of a group of three British and four American ISM activists attempting to disrupt the IDF operation. Corrie placed herself in the path of a Caterpillar D9R armored bulldozer in the area and was run over by the bulldozer and fatally injured. After she was injured she was taken by a Red Crescent ambulance to the Palestinian Najar hospital, arriving at the emergency room at 5:05 pm, still alive but in critical condition. At 5:20 pm she was declared dead.

The events surrounding Corrie&#x27;s death are disputed. Fellow ISM activists said that the soldier operating the bulldozer deliberately ran Corrie over while she was acting as a human shield to prevent the demolition of the home of local pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. They said she was between the bulldozer and a wall near Nasrallah&#x27;s home, in which ISM activists had spent the night several times. An IDF officer testified in court that her death was accidental because the bulldozer operator did not see Corrie due to the vehicle&#x27;s obstructed view, and that on that day they were only clearing vegetation and rubble from houses that were previously demolished, and that no new houses were slated for demolition.

The major points of dispute are whether the bulldozer operator saw Corrie and whether her injuries were caused by being crushed under the blade or by the mound of debris the bulldozer was pushing. An IDF spokesman has acknowledged that Israeli army regulations normally require that the operators of the armored personnel carriers (APCs) that accompany bulldozers are responsible for directing the operators towards their targets because the Caterpillar D9 bulldozers have a restricted field of vision with several blind spots.

===ISM accounts===
An ISM activist using the name &quot;Richard&quot;, saying he had witnessed Corrie&#x27;s death, told &quot;Haaretz&quot;:

There&#x27;s no way he didn&#x27;t see her, since she was practically looking into the cabin. At one stage, he turned around toward the building. The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I guess it was about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her and for some reason didn&#x27;t stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn&#x27;t lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.

Eyewitness and ISM member Tom Dale, commenting on the 2012 verdict said: &quot;Whatever one thinks about the visibility from a D9 bulldozer, it is inconceivable that at some point the driver did not see her, given the distance from which he approached, while she stood, unmoving, in front of it. As I told the court, just before she was crushed, Rachel briefly stood on top of the rolling mound of earth which had gathered in front of the bulldozer: her head was above the level of the blade, and just a few meters from the driver.&quot;

Joe Carr, an American ISM activist who used the assumed name of Joseph Smith during his time in Gaza, gave the following account in an affidavit recorded and published by the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR):

Still wearing her fluorescent jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters in front of the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer&#x27;s blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.

On March 18, 2003, two days after Corrie&#x27;s death, Joe (Smith) Carr was interviewed by British Channel 4 and &quot;The Observer&quot; reporter Sandra Jordan for a documentary, &quot;The Killing Zone&quot;, which aired in June 2003. He stated, &quot;It was either a really gross mistake or a really brutal murder.&quot;

According to &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, &quot;Smith, who witnessed Sunday&#x27;s incident, said it began when Corrie sat down in front of the bulldozer. He said the operator scooped her up with a pile of earth, dumped her on the ground and ran over her twice.&quot;

However, &quot;Smith&quot; later acknowledged that after Corrie fell down the dirt pile, the bulldozer operator could well have lost sight of Corrie.

===Israeli accounts===
The bulldozer operator was interviewed on Israeli TV and insisted he had no idea she was in front of him:
You can&#x27;t hear, you can&#x27;t see well. You can go over something and you&#x27;ll never know. I scooped up some earth, I couldn&#x27;t see anything. I pushed the earth, and I didn&#x27;t see her at all. Maybe she was hiding in there.

The IDF produced a video about Corrie&#x27;s death that includes footage taken from inside the cockpit of a D9. The video makes a &quot;credible case&quot;, wrote Joshua Hammer in &quot;Mother Jones,&quot; that &quot;the operators, peering out through narrow, double-glazed, bulletproof windows, their view obscured behind pistons and the giant scooper, might not have seen Corrie kneeling in front of them&quot;.

In April 2011, during the trial of the civil suit brought by Corrie&#x27;s parents, an IDF officer testified that Corrie and other activists had spent hours trying to block the bulldozers under his command. He went on to say that it was a war zone &quot;where Palestinian militants used abandoned homes as firing positions and exploited foreign activists for cover&quot;. He shouted over a megaphone for the activists to leave, tried to use tear gas to disperse them and moved his troops several times. &quot;To my regret, after the eighth time, (Corrie) hid behind an earth embankment. The D9 operator didn&#x27;t see her. She thought he saw her,&quot; he said.

An infantry major later testified that the activists were endangering troops and had ignored numerous warnings to leave the area. The judge in the Corrie case asserted that between September 2000 and the date of Corrie&#x27;s death, Israeli forces in the area had been subjected to 1,400 attacks involving gunfire, 150 involving explosive devices, 200 involving anti-tank rockets, and 6,000 involving hand grenades or mortar fire.

===Autopsy===
Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon promised President Bush a &quot;thorough, credible, and transparent investigation&quot;. Later, Capt. Jacob Dallal, a spokesman for the Israeli army, called Corrie&#x27;s death a &quot;regrettable accident&quot; and said that she and the other ISM activists were &quot;a group of protesters who were acting very irresponsibly, putting everyone in danger—the Palestinians, themselves and our forces—by intentionally placing themselves in a combat zone&quot;.

An autopsy was conducted on March 24 at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv by Chief Pathologist Yehuda Hiss. The final report was not released publicly, but in their report on the matter Human Rights Watch says a copy was provided to them by Craig Corrie, with a translation supplied by the U.S. Department of State. In the report they quote Hiss as concluding, &quot;Her death was caused by pressure on the chest (mechanical asphyxiation) with fractures of the ribs and vertebrae of the dorsal spinal column and scapulas, and tear wounds in the right lung with hemorrhaging of the pleural cavities.&quot;

===Military investigation===
The Israeli army&#x27;s report [seen by &quot;The Guardian&quot;], said:

On June 26, 2003, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; quoted an Israeli military spokesman as saying that Corrie had not been run over and that the operator had not seen her:
The driver at no point saw or heard Corrie. She was standing behind debris which obstructed the view of the driver and the driver had a very limited field of vision due to the protective cage he was working in... The driver and his commanders were interrogated extensively over a long period of time with the use of polygraph tests and video evidence. They had no knowledge that she was standing in the path of the tractor. An autopsy of Corrie&#x27;s body revealed that the cause of death was from falling debris and not from the tractor physically rolling over her. It was a tragic accident that never should have happened.

Howard Blume told that IDF stated:

[a bulldozer with 2 crews] was engaged in &quot;routine terrain leveling and debris clearing&quot;, not building demolition. Quoting from the IDF report, Corrie died &quot;as a result of injuries sustained when earth and debris accidentally fell on her... Ms. Corrie was not run over by the bulldozer,&quot; he added, IDF also claimed she was possibly &quot;in a blindspot for the bulldozer operators and &quot;behind an earth mound&quot;, so they did not see that she was in harm&#x27;s way.

In later IDF operations, the house was damaged (a hole was knocked in a wall) and was later destroyed. By that time, the Nasrallah family had moved into a different house. It was reported in 2006 that the house that Corrie was trying to protect was rebuilt with funds raised by The Rebuilding Alliance.

A spokesman for the IDF told the &quot;Guardian&quot; that, while it did not accept responsibility for Corrie&#x27;s death, it intended to change its operational procedures to avoid similar incidents in the future. The level of command of similar operations would be raised, said the spokesman, and civilians in the area would be dispersed or arrested before operations began. Observers will be deployed and CCTV cameras will be installed on the bulldozers to compensate for blind spots, which may have contributed to Corrie&#x27;s death.

The IDF gave copies of the report, titled &quot;The Death of Rachel Corrie&quot;, to members of the U.S. Congress in April 2003, and Corrie&#x27;s family released the document to the media in June 2003, according to the Gannett News Service. In March 2004, the family said that the entire report had not been released, and that only they and two American staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv had been allowed to view it. The family said they were allowed to look at the report in the Consulate General of Israel to the Pacific Northwest in San Francisco. The ISM rejected the Israeli report, stating that it contradicted their members&#x27; eyewitness reports and that the investigation had not been credible and transparent.

==Reactions==
Corrie&#x27;s death sparked controversy and led to international media coverage.

===Corrie&#x27;s parents&#x27; reaction===
In 2012, Corrie&#x27;s father, Craig Corrie said &quot;I know there&#x27;s stuff you can&#x27;t see out of the double glass windows.&quot; But he has denied that as a valid excuse, saying &quot;you&#x27;re responsible for knowing what&#x27;s in front of your blade... It&#x27;s a no brainer that this was gross negligence&quot;. He added that &quot;they had three months to figure out how to deal with the activists that were there.&quot;

===Political reactions===
In March 2003, U.S. Representative Brian Baird introduced a resolution in the U.S. Congress calling on the U.S. government to &quot;undertake a full, fair, and expeditious investigation&quot; into Corrie&#x27;s death. The House of Representatives took no action on the resolution. The Corrie family joined Representative Baird in calling for a U.S. investigation.

Yasser Arafat, the first President of the Palestinian Authority, offered his condolences and gave the &quot;blessings of the Palestinian people&quot; to Corrie, promising to name a street in Gaza after her. According to Cindy Corrie, Arafat told Craig Corrie that Rachel Corrie &quot;is your daughter but she is also the daughter of all Palestinians. She is ours too now.&quot;

On March 21, 2003, the U.S. Green Party called for an investigation of the &quot;murder of American Peace Activist Rachel Corrie by Israeli Forces&quot;.

In August 2012, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro stated that the Israeli investigation was not satisfactory, and was not as thorough, credible or transparent as it should have been. Shapiro said further that the government of the United States is unsatisfied with the IDF&#x27;s closure of its official investigation into Corrie&#x27;s death.

===Human rights organizations===
Amnesty International called for an independent inquiry, with Christine Bustany, their advocacy director for the Middle East, saying, &quot;U.S.-made bulldozers have been &#x27;weaponized&#x27; and their transfer to Israel must be suspended.&quot;

In 2005, Human Rights Watch published a report raising questions about the impartiality and professionalism of the IDF investigation. Some of the problems that the report mentioned were the investigators&#x27; lack of preparation, the &quot;hostile&quot;, &quot;inappropriate&quot;, and &quot;mostly accusatory&quot; questions they asked witnesses, the failure to ask witnesses to draw maps or to identify locations of events on maps, and their lack of interest in reconciling soldiers&#x27; testimonies with those of other eyewitnesses.

NGO Monitor, an Israeli group, strongly criticized other NGOs and said the verdict reflects all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident. Its president, Gerald Steinberg said, &quot;Corrie&#x27;s death was entirely unnecessary, and the leaders of the ISM bear much culpability for her death.&quot;

A Catholic Worker house was named in her honor in Des Moines, Iowa.

===Media===
Sandra Jordan wrote in &quot;The Observer&quot; that because Corrie was American her death attracted more attention than the deaths of Palestinians under similar circumstances: &quot;On the night of Corrie&#x27;s death, nine Palestinians were killed in the Gaza Strip, among them a four-year-old girl and a man aged 90. A total of 220 people have died in Rafah since the beginning of the intifada. Palestinians know the death of one American receives more attention than the killing of hundreds of Muslims.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Haaretz&quot; political columnist Bradley Burston said that Corrie&#x27;s death was accidental but that &quot;incidental killing is no less tragic than intentional killing&quot;; Burston criticized both the pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli sides for their excessive rhetoric:

Of all of the tragedies and casualties of the intifada, in which more than 4,000 people were killed over five years, the case of Rachel Corrie still stands apart, the subject of intense world interest and fierce debate... Part of it starts with us. &quot;They had no business being there&quot; is no excuse for what the Pentagon long ago christened collateral damage. We&#x27;ve learned much. But we&#x27;re still not there. We should have saved Rachel Corrie&#x27;s life that day, either by sending out a spotter or delaying the bulldozer&#x27;s work. Right now, somewhere in the West Bank, there&#x27;s an eight-year-old whose life could be saved next week, if we&#x27;ve managed to learn the lesson and are resourceful enough to know how to apply it.

Charlie Wolf, formerly the Communications Director of Republicans Abroad UK, referred to Corrie as &quot;scum&quot; on his show on British radio station talkSPORT. Media regulator Ofcom ruled that this &quot;seriously ill-judged&quot; remark was in breach of the &quot;Generally Accepted Standards&quot; of Broadcasting.

===Israeli court&#x27;s justification===
Explaining the Israeli court&#x27;s ruling, judge Oded Gershon said Corrie&#x27;s death was &quot;the result of an accident she brought upon herself.&quot; Corrie was in a closed military area, with entry forbidden to civilians. The area was the site of daily gunfire by snipers, missile fire and IED explosions. The United States government had issued a travel warning against American citizens visiting the Gaza Strip. &quot;She did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done,&quot; the judge ruled.

===Role of the International Solidarity Movement===
George Rishmawi, director of the Palestinian Center for Rapprochement between Peoples, told the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; that the ISM&#x27;s main purpose is to &quot;increase international awareness of Palestinian suffering through the involvement of foreign activists&quot;. He stated: &quot;When Palestinians get shot by Israeli soldiers, no one is interested anymore ... [b]ut if some of these foreign volunteers get shot or even killed, then the international media will sit up and take notice.&quot;

Joseph Smith (aka Joseph Carr) stated that &quot;&#x27;We knew there was a risk ... but we also knew it never happened in the two years that we (the ISM) have been working here. I knew we take lots of precautions so that it doesn&#x27;t happen, that if it did happen it would have to be an intentional act by a soldier, in which case it would bring a lot of publicity and significance to the cause.&#x27;&quot;

===Activities of Corrie&#x27;s parents===

Since their daughter&#x27;s death, Corrie&#x27;s parents, Cindy and Craig, have spent time trying to &quot;promote peace and raise awareness about the plight of Palestinians&quot;, and continue what they believe to be her work. The Corries have worked to set up the &quot;Rachel Corrie Foundation for Peace and Justice&quot; and launched projects in memory of their daughter. They have also advanced investigation into the incident and asked the U.S. Congress and various courts for redress.

Corrie&#x27;s parents have visited the region several times since their daughter&#x27;s death and have twice visited Gaza. Following their daughter&#x27;s death, they visited Gaza and Israel, seeing the place where she died, and meeting ISM members and Palestinians whom she had known. They also visited Ramallah in the West Bank, where Arafat met them and presented them with a plaque in memory of their daughter. On March 28, 2008, they addressed a demonstration in Ramallah at which Craig Corrie said: &quot;This village has become a symbol of nonviolent resistance. I call for solidarity with the people of Palestine in resisting the conditions imposed by the Israeli occupation to prevent the establishment of their state.&quot;

The Nasrallahs, whose home Rachel Corrie allegedly believed she was preventing from destruction, toured with the Corries across the United States in June 2005. The aim of the trip was, with the cooperation of the Rebuilding Alliance, to raise funds to rebuild the Nasrallah home and other homes destroyed in Rafah.

In January 2011, Corrie&#x27;s parents visited the MV &quot;Mavi Marmara&quot; in Turkey, together with the head of the IHH Bülent Yıldırım. Cindy Corrie called dead &quot;Mavi Marmara&quot; activists &quot;martyrs&quot; and compared them to her daughter.

After the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas War in 2023, the couple referred to the situation as genocide against Palestinian people and have been trying to keep in touch with Palestinians on the ground.

Following the killing of Aysenur Eygi in 2024, Corrie&#x27;s parents called for an inquiry into the death. Craig Corrie remarked that there were &quot;so many similarities&quot; between the killing of Eygi, who was shot dead by the Israel Defense Forces while protesting Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, and the death of his daughter.

==Subsequent events==
===Lawsuits===
====In the United States====
Corrie&#x27;s family and several Palestinians filed a federal lawsuit against Caterpillar Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging liability for Corrie&#x27;s death. The suit alleged Caterpillar supplied the bulldozers to the Israelis despite having notice they would be used to further &quot;a policy plaintiffs contend violates international law&quot;. The case was dismissed by a Federal judge in November 2005 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, citing, among other things, the political question doctrine. The judge found, alternatively, that the plaintiffs&#x27; claims failed on the merits.

The Corrie family appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In September 2007 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal on the political question grounds and thus did not rule on the merits of the suit. The Court found that as the bulldozers were paid for by the U.S. Government as part of its aid to Israel, the Judicial Branch could not rule on the merits of the case without ruling on whether or not the government&#x27;s financing of such bulldozers was appropriate and that this was a matter not entrusted to the Judicial Branch.

====In Israel====
In 2010, Corrie&#x27;s parents, represented by Attorney Hussein Abu Hussein, filed a lawsuit against the Israel Defense Forces and the Israeli Defense Ministry in the Haifa District Court, seeking US$324,000 in compensation. The case began in Haifa on March 10, 2010. Judge Oded Gershon presided over the case. On October 21, 2010, the bulldozer driver who had run over Corrie testified for four hours, and was cross-examined by the Corries&#x27; attorney. At the request of state prosecutors, who argued that his life could be imperiled if he was publicly identified, the driver was hidden behind a screen and visible to only the judge and attorneys. A request by the Corrie family that they also be allowed to see the driver was turned down by the judge. The driver was identified only by his initials, &quot;YB&quot;, and a gag order was imposed on identifying details, although it was disclosed in court that he was a 38-year old Russian immigrant who had arrived in Israel at age 23, and was working for a food processing company at the time. The driver denied having seen her before hitting her. In addition, four experts, including an expert on the behalf of the Corrie family testified during the trial, and concluded that the bulldozer driver could not see Corrie. Four ISM witnesses testified during the case. However, the Palestinian physician from Gaza who had examined Corrie&#x27;s wounds on the scene was unable to testify after Israel refused him an entry visa and rejected an application for him to testify by video link.

The court ruled against Corrie&#x27;s family on August 28, 2012. In a 62-page verdict, Judge Oded Gershon ruled that Corrie&#x27;s death was an accident for which she was responsible, and absolved the IDF of any wrongdoing. The judge ruled that the bulldozer driver and his commander had a very limited field of vision and could not possibly have seen her. According to the judge &quot;The mission of the IDF force on the day of the incident was solely to clear the ground... The mission did not include, in any way, the demolition of homes.&quot; The court invoked the principle of the combatant activities exception, as the IDF was attacked in the same area where Corrie was killed a few hours earlier; that Corrie could have avoided the danger and that defendants were not at fault as there was neither intent nor negligence involved in her death. The judge said that the IDF did not violate Corrie&#x27;s right to life because Corrie had placed herself in a dangerous situation, that Israel&#x27;s investigation was appropriate and did not contain mistakes, and also criticized the U.S. government for failing to send a diplomatic representative to observe Corrie&#x27;s autopsy. Gershon said: &quot;I rule unequivocally that the claim that the deceased was intentionally hit by the bulldozer is totally baseless. This was an extremely unfortunate accident. I reached the conclusion that there was no negligence on the part of the bulldozer driver. I reject the suit. There is no justification to demand the state pay any damages. She [Corrie] did not distance herself from the area, as any thinking person would have done. She consciously put herself in harm&#x27;s way.&quot;

Furthermore, Gershon pointed to three different entry bans, and also pointed out that the Philadelphi route was effectively a war zone and was formally declared a closed military zone when Corrie died. Gershon also noted that the United States had issued an Israel travel advisory warning to avoid Gaza and the West Bank. In addition, Gershon said that the ISM &quot;abuses the human rights discourse to blur its actions which are de facto violence&quot; and specialized in disrupting IDF activity, which &quot;included an army of activists serving as &#x27;human shields&#x27; for terrorists wanted by Israeli security forces, financial and logistical aid to Palestinians including terrorists and their families, and disruption of the sealing of suicide bombers&#x27; houses&quot;. The Corrie family lawyer, Hussein Abu Hussein, said they were &quot;now studying our options&quot;, in regards to a possible appeal.

While rejecting the Corrie family&#x27;s claims to damages, the judge also waived the Corrie family&#x27;s court costs.

Haifa District Court spokeswoman Nitzan Eyal said that her family could appeal the ruling. The amount sought was a symbolic US$1 and legal costs. Her mother reacted to the verdict in saying: &quot;I am hurt. We are, of course, deeply saddened and deeply troubled by what we heard today from Judge Oded Gershon.&quot; Corrie&#x27;s sister, Sarah Corrie Simpson, stated that she believed &quot;without a doubt&quot; that the driver had seen her as he approached, and stated that she hoped he would one day &quot;have the courage&quot; to tell the truth. The right wing political party Yisrael Beitenu issued a statement that called the verdict &quot;vindication after vilification&quot;.

Former UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian Territories Richard Falk said of the verdict that it was &quot;a sad outcome, above all for the Corrie family that had initiated the case back in 2005, but also for the rule of law and the hope that an Israeli court would place limits on the violence of the state, particularly in relation to innocents and unarmed civilians in an occupied territory&quot;. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter of the Carter Center said that the &quot;court&#x27;s decision confirms a climate of impunity, which facilitates Israeli human rights violations against Palestinian civilians in the Occupied Territory&quot;.

The verdict of the Haifa District Court was appealed to the Supreme Court of Israel on May 21, 2014. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal and upheld the District Court&#x27;s verdict regarding the circumstances of Corrie&#x27;s death, which cleared the IDF from wrongdoing.

===Memorial events===

Immediately after her death, posters and graffiti praising Corrie were posted in Rafah, with one graffiti tag reading, &quot;Rachel was an American citizen with Palestinian blood.&quot; According to the ISM&#x27;s official publications, the day after Corrie died, about thirty American and European ISM activists with 300 Palestinians began protests during the public memorial service over the spot where she was fatally injured in Rafah. Gordon Murray, an ISM activist who attended the memorial, states that the IDF sent a representative to the event who intimidated the mourners into dispersing, allegedly using non-lethal weapons.

In 2008, Corrie&#x27;s parents commemorated the fifth anniversary of her death at an event held in the West Bank town of Nablus. About 150 Palestinians and foreigners joined them to dedicate a memorial to Corrie on one of the city&#x27;s streets.

In 2011, Iran named a street in Tehran after Corrie.

===Artistic tributes===

In 2004, Alaska composer Philip Munger wrote a cantata about Corrie called &quot;The Skies are Weeping&quot;, which was scheduled to premiere on April 27 at the University of Alaska Anchorage, where Munger teaches. After objections to the upcoming performance were received, including from members of the Jewish community, a forum was held co-chaired by Munger and a local rabbi who claimed the work &quot;romanticized terrorism&quot;. After the forum &quot;disintegrate[d]&quot;, Munger announced, &quot;I cannot subject 16 students ... to any possibility of physical harm or to the type of character assassination some of us are already undergoing. Performance of &quot;The Skies are Weeping&quot; at this time and place is withdrawn for the safety of the student performers.&quot; Munger later related that he had received threatening e-mails whose content he considered was &quot;[just] short of what you&#x27;d take to the troopers&quot;, and that some of his students had received similar communications. The cantata was eventually performed at the Hackney Empire theatre in London, premiering on November 1, 2005.

In early 2005, &quot;My Name is Rachel Corrie&quot;, a play composed from Corrie&#x27;s journals and emails from Gaza and compiled by actor Alan Rickman and journalist Katharine Viner, in a production directed by Rickman, was presented in London and later revived in October 2005. The play was to be transferred to the New York Theatre Workshop, but when it was postponed indefinitely, the British producers denounced the decision as censorship and withdrew the show. It finally opened Off-Broadway on October 15, 2006, for an initial run of 48 performances. In the same year, &quot;My Name is Rachel Corrie&quot; was shown at the Pleasance theatre as part of the Edinburgh (Fringe) Festival. The play has also been published as a paperback, and performed in ten countries, including Israel.

Singer Billy Bragg recounted Corrie&#x27;s death in the song &quot;The Lonesome Death of Rachel Corrie&quot;, composed to the tune of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll&quot;. After being originally released as a free digital download, it was included on the album &quot;Fight Songs&quot; in 2011. Irish folk music/world music group Kíla included the instrumental &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot; on their 2015 album &quot;Suas Síos&quot;.

In 2003, Pittsburgh singer Mike Stout wrote and composed a song about Rachel Corrie, which was included with other anti-war songs in his album &quot;War and Resistance&quot;.

Also in 2003, David Rovics wrote the song &quot;The Death of Rachel Corrie&quot;, included on his album &quot;Return&quot;.

===Documentaries===
In 2003, British Channel 4 and &quot;The Observer&quot; reporter Sandra Jordan and producer Rodrigo Vasquez made a documentary that was aired June 2003 on Channel 4 titled &quot;The Killing Zone&quot;, about ongoing violence in the Gaza Strip. Jordan said: &quot;There has been a lot of interest in Britain and around the world about what happened to Rachel, I find it highly disappointing that no serious American investigative journalist has taken Rachel&#x27;s story seriously or questioned or challenged the Israeli Army version of events.&quot;

In 2005, the BBC produced a 60 minute documentary titled &quot;When Killing is Easy aka Shooting the Messenger, Why are foreigners suddenly under fire in Israel?&quot;, described as &quot;a meticulous examination of&quot; the shooting to death of James Miller, who was shot while filming in an Israeli war zone in May 2003; the shooting of British photography student Thomas Hurndall in April 2003, and the death of Rachel Corrie in March 2003. The documentary states that the attacks were not &quot;random acts of violence&quot;, but rather &quot;represent a culture of killing with impunity which is sanctioned by the higher echelons of the Israeli army.&quot;

In 2005 Yahya Barakat, who lectures on TV production, cinematography, and filmmaking at al-Quds University, filmed a documentary in Arabic with English subtitles, named &quot;Rachel Corrie – An American Conscience&quot;.

In 2009, a documentary film titled &quot;Rachel&quot; is produced by Morocco-born French-Israeli director Simone Bitton detailing the death of Rachel Corrie from &quot;an Israeli point of view&quot;. Its first North American public screening was at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.

===MV &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot;===

On March 30, 2010, an 1800-tonne vessel was bought at auction in Dundalk, Ireland, for €70,000 by the Free Gaza Movement. It was outfitted for use in a voyage to Gaza, named in honour of Rachel Corrie and launched May 12, 2010. It sailed to join a flotilla intended to break the blockade of the Gaza Strip. The flotilla was intercepted; however, the MV &quot;Rachel Corrie&quot; had not reached the other ships and continued towards Gaza by itself. Israeli navy officers addressed the ship as &quot;Linda&quot;—the vessel&#x27;s name before it was renamed for Rachel Corrie. The ship was intercepted by the Israeli navy on Saturday, June 5, 2010, 23 miles off the coast, and diverted to the port of Ashdod. There the cargo was to be inspected and sent over land to Gaza.

===Symbolic gravestone in Iran===
On the twelfth anniversary of Corrie&#x27;s death, a symbolic gravestone with her name was installed in the Tehran cemetery to honor her by the Commemoration of Martyrs of movement of the Islamic World&#x27;s Staff. Near her symbolic gravestone are twelve other symbolic gravestones.

===Revelation of Caterpillar surveillance===
In 2017, documents emerged that showed Caterpillar had hired private investigators to spy on the family of Rachel Corrie following her killing in early 2003.

=== May 2024 arson attack ===
During the ongoing Israel–Hamas war protests in the United States, a presumably pro-Palestinian group calling itself &quot;Rachel Corrie&#x27;s Ghost Brigade&quot; reported that it had cut through a fence at a Portland police facility and burned 17 police cars on 2 May 2024.

<text>No Dice is the third studio album by British rock band Badfinger, issued by Apple Records and released on 9 November 1970. Their second album under the Badfinger name, but their first official album under that name, and first to include guitarist Joey Molland, &quot;No Dice&quot; significantly expanded the British group&#x27;s popularity, especially abroad. The album included both the hit single &quot;No Matter What&quot; and the song &quot;Without You&quot;, which would become a big hit for Harry Nilsson, and later a hit for Mariah Carey.

== Background ==

Although this was the band&#x27;s second album released under the Badfinger name, the previous album, &quot;Magic Christian Music&quot;, was originally recorded as &quot;The Iveys&quot; but released as Badfinger. It was the band&#x27;s first album recorded after new guitarist Joey Molland joined the group, replacing bassist Ron Griffiths, but Molland&#x27;s addition caused Tom Evans to switch from rhythm guitar to bass. Badfinger would release five albums, generally their most successful recordings, with this line-up.

The model depicted on the album cover has never been formally identified. According to Molland, &quot;the woman was a model hired by Gene Mahon and Richard DiLello for the shoot, they designed the cover, [and] we never actually met her.&quot; When he asked DiLello about her &quot;at a Beatlefest in the 70s,&quot; DiLello gave her name as Kathy. (Molland&#x27;s own wife, Kathie, also worked as a model.)

== Release ==
&quot;No Dice&quot; peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 200 chart. Widely praised in music reviews at the time, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine opined that it represented what the Beatles would have sounded like had they retained their initial formula.

The single from this LP, &quot;No Matter What&quot;, peaked in the United States at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1970. The song is often regarded as an early offering in the power pop genre. The album also contains the original version of &quot;Without You&quot;. Although Badfinger did not release the song as a single in Europe or North America, it was taken to number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1972 by Harry Nilsson, and became a hit for Mariah Carey in 1994. &quot;Without You&quot; has been the top money-earner for Badfinger in publishing royalties, having been covered by over 200 artists. The song was also picked to provide the title for Dan Matovina&#x27;s 1997 biography &quot;Without You: The Tragic Story Of Badfinger&quot;.

In October 1991, &quot;No Dice&quot; was digitally remastered at Abbey Road Studio by Ron Furmanek. The remastered album was released in 1992 by Capitol Records and Apple, with five previously unreleased bonus tracks. Of the bonus tracks, &quot;Friends Are Hard to Find&quot; was an outtake from the same Mal Evans-produced session that saw the recording of &quot;No Matter What&quot; and &quot;Believe Me&quot;. &quot;Get Down&quot; was originally attempted with Evans, but the version here was recorded with Geoff Emerick. The three remaining tracks, &quot;Mean, Mean Jemima&quot;, &quot;Loving You&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be the One&quot;, were recorded with Emerick between January and March 1971 (after the completion of &quot;No Dice&quot;) for the intended follow-up album that was never released.

== Critical reception ==

Reviewing for &quot;Creem&quot; in 1971, Mike Saunders wrote effusively about the album and the band itself: &quot;Badfinger is one of the best songwriting groups around, one of the best singing groups anywhere, and now with an absolutely great lead guitarist in Pete Ham, they&#x27;re really one fucking whale of a group.&quot; Robert Christgau was somewhat less enthusiastic, writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981): &quot;I don&#x27;t think these guys imitate the Beatles just so Paul will give them more hits — they&#x27;ve got hits of their own. But from the guitar parts (play &#x27;Better Days&#x27; right after &#x27;I Feel Fine&#x27;) and harmonies (the Paul of &#x27;I&#x27;ve Just Seen a Face&#x27; atop the Paul of &#x27;Long Tall Sally&#x27;) to concept and lineup, an imitation is what this is, modernized slightly via some relaxed countrification. They write almost well enough to get away with it, too. But somehow the song that stands out is &#x27;Blodwyn,&#x27; a simulated (I think) English folk ditty about a swain and a spoon that has nothing to do with the Fab Four at all.&quot;

<doc id="197522" wikidata="Q231690" url="?curid=197522" title="B. R. Ambedkar">
<text>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (Bhīmrāo Rāmjī Āmbēḍkar; 14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who chaired the committee that drafted the Constitution of India based on the debates of the Constituent Assembly of India and the first draft of Sir Benegal Narsing Rau. Ambedkar served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru. He later renounced Hinduism, converted to Buddhism and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement. 

After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the law at Gray&#x27;s Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation &quot;Jai Bhim&quot; (lit. &quot;Hail Bhim&quot;) used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the honorific Babasaheb ( ), meaning &quot;Respected Father&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar, Madhya Pradesh). He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar. His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar&#x27;s ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.

Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (Dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination. Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as &quot;No peon, No Water&quot;. He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar&#x27;s mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons – Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school. His original surname was &quot;Sakpal&quot; but his father registered his name as &quot;Ambadawekar&quot; in school, meaning he comes from his native village &#x27;Ambadawe&#x27; in Ratnagiri district. His Marathi Brahmin teacher, Krishnaji Keshav Ambedkar, changed his surname from &#x27;Ambadawekar&#x27; to his own surname &#x27;Ambedkar&#x27; in school records.

=== Education ===
In 1897, Ambedkar&#x27;s family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match was arranged by the couple&#x27;s parents, in accordance with prevailing custom at that time.

In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone College, which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached &quot;great heights&quot; which he says was &quot;hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities&quot;. A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.
In 1913, at the age of 22, Ambedkar was awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by Sayajirao Gaekwad III (Gaekwad of Baroda) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at Columbia University in New York City. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at Livingston Hall with Naval Bhathena, a Parsi who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, &quot;Ancient Indian Commerce&quot;. Ambedkar was influenced by John Dewey and his work on democracy.

In 1916, he completed his second master&#x27;s thesis, &quot;National Dividend of India – A Historic and Analytical Study&quot;, for a second M.A. On 9 May, he presented the paper &quot;Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development&quot; before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist Alexander Goldenweiser. Ambedkar received his Ph.D. degree in economics at Columbia in 1927.In October 1916, he enrolled for the Bar course at Gray&#x27;s Inn, and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on a different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master&#x27;s degree in 1921. His thesis was on &quot;The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution&quot;. In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics which was awarded from University of London, and the same year he was called to the Bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn.

==Opposition to untouchability==

As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, &quot;Waiting for a Visa&quot;. Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable. In 1918, he became professor of political economy in the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the Southborough Committee, which was preparing the Government of India Act 1919. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate electorates and reservations for untouchables and other religious communities. In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly &quot;Mooknayak&quot; (Leader of the Silent) in Mumbai with the help of Shahu of Kolhapur, that is, Shahu IV (1874–1922).

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. Dhananjay Keer notes, &quot;The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the doctor&quot;.

While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha, intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of &quot;outcastes&quot;, at the time referred to as depressed classes. For the defence of Dalit rights, he started many periodicals like &quot;Mook Nayak&quot;, &quot;Bahishkrit Bharat&quot;, and &quot;Equality Janta&quot;.

He was appointed to the Bombay Presidency Committee to work with the all-European Simon Commission in 1925. This commission had sparked great protests across India, and while its report was ignored by most Indians, Ambedkar himself wrote a separate set of recommendations for the future Constitution of India.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against untouchability. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led &quot;a satyagraha&quot; in Mahad to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town. In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the Manusmriti (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and &quot;untouchability&quot;, and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text. On 25 December 1927, he led thousands of followers to burn copies of Manusmriti. Thus annually 25 December is celebrated as &quot;Manusmriti Dahan Din&quot; (Manusmriti Burning Day) by Ambedkarites and Dalits.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched the Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at Kalaram Temple satygraha making one of the greatest processions of Nashik. The procession was headed by a military band and a batch of scouts; women and men walked with discipline, order and determination to see the god for the first time. When they reached the gates, the gates were closed by Brahmin authorities.

==Poona Pact==
In 1932, the British colonial government announced the formation of a separate electorate for &quot;Depressed Classes&quot; in the Communal Award. Mahatma Gandhi fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community. Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail of Poona. Following the fast, congressional politicians and activists such as Madan Mohan Malaviya and Palwankar Baloo organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada. On 25 September 1932, the agreement, known as the Poona Pact was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Madan Mohan Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures within the general electorate. Due to the pact the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature instead of the 71, as allocated in the Communal Award proposed earlier by the colonial government under Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The text used the term &quot;Depressed Classes&quot; to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under the India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950. In the Poona Pact, a unified electorate was in principle formed, but primary and secondary elections allowed Untouchables in practice to choose their own candidates.

==Political career==
In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath. Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books. His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism&#x27;s Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism. He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.

In 1936, Ambedkar founded the Independent Labour Party, which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the Central Legislative Assembly for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.

Ambedkar published his book &quot;Annihilation of Caste&quot; on 15 May 1936. It strongly criticised Hindu orthodox religious leaders and the caste system in general, and included &quot;a rebuke of Gandhi&quot; on the subject. Later, in a 1955 BBC interview, he accused Gandhi of writing in opposition of the caste system in English language papers while writing in support of it in Gujarati language papers. In his writings, Ambedkar also accused Jawaharlal Nehru of being &quot;conscious of the fact that he is a Brahmin&quot;.

During this time, Ambedkar also fought against the &quot;khoti&quot; system prevalent in Konkan, where &quot;khots&quot;, or government revenue collectors, regularly exploited farmers and tenants. In 1937, Ambedkar tabled a bill in the Bombay Legislative Assembly aimed at abolishing the &quot;khoti&quot; system by creating a direct relationship between government and farmers.

Ambedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee and the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council as minister of labour. Before the Day of Deliverance events, Ambedkar stated that he was interested in participating: &quot;I read Mr. Jinnah&#x27;s statement and I felt ashamed to have allowed him to steal a march over me and rob me of the language and the sentiment which I, more than Mr. Jinnah, was entitled to use.&quot; He went on to suggest that the communities he worked with were twenty times more oppressed by Congress policies than were Indian Muslims; he clarified that he was criticizing Congress, and not all Hindus. Jinnah and Ambedkar jointly addressed the heavily attended Day of Deliverance event in Bhindi Bazaar, Bombay, where both expressed &quot;fiery&quot; criticisms of the Congress party, and according to one observer, suggested that Islam and Hinduism were irreconcilable.

After the Lahore resolution (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled &quot;Thoughts on Pakistan&quot;, which analysed the concept of &quot;Pakistan&quot; in all its aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite &quot;understand the nature of their own demand&quot;. Scholar Venkat Dhulipala states that &quot;Thoughts on Pakistan&quot; &quot;rocked Indian politics for a decade&quot;. It determined the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the Partition of India.

In his work &quot;Who Were the Shudras?&quot;, Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the caste system, as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the Scheduled Castes Federation. It did not fare well in the 1946 provincial elections, but in Bengal, it managed to elect Ambedkar to the Constituent Assembly of India by winning support from Congress legislators.

Jagjivan Ram&#x27;s wife Indrani Jagjivan Ram wrote in her memoir that Ambedkar persuaded her husband to ask Mahatma Gandhi for his inclusion in Nehru&#x27;s cabinet in independent India. Initially, Jagjivan Ram consulted Vallabhbhai Patel before asking Gandhi to recommend Ambedkar to Nehru for inclusion in cabinet, adding that Ambedkar had &quot;given up his antagonism to Congress and Gandhiji&quot;. Ambedkar was ultimately included as the law minister of India in the First Nehru ministry after Gandhi recommended his name to Nehru.

On 27 September 1951, Ambedkar resigned from Nehru&#x27;s cabinet ministry after Hindu code bill was defeated in parliament.

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Sadoba Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the Partition of India, he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

==Drafting of India&#x27;s Constitution==
Upon India&#x27;s independence on 15 August 1947, the new prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Ambedkar to serve as the Dominion of India&#x27;s Law Minister; two weeks later, he was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution for the future Republic of India.

On 25 November 1949, Ambedkar in his concluding speech in constituent assembly said:
Indian constitution guarantees and protections for a wide range of civil liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar was one of the ministers who argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly&#x27;s support for introducing a system of reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other Backward Class, a system akin to affirmative action. India&#x27;s lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India&#x27;s depressed classes through these measures. The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly.

Ambedkar had openly shared his concern in the Constituent Assembly that country might lose both its Constitution and its democratic freedoms in the future. He believed that the lack of a strong democratic tradition, the widespread presence of ‘bhakti’ or political ‘hero worship’ and the large gap between the republican promises of the Constitution and socio-economic inequality, made this a distinct and ever-present possibility.

Ambedkar expressed his disapproval for the constitution in 1953 during a parliament session and said &quot;People always keep on saying to me &quot;Oh you are the maker of the constitution&quot;. My answer is I was a hack. What I was asked to do, I did much against my will.&quot; Ambedkar added that, &quot;I am quite prepared to say that I shall be the first person to burn it out. I do not want it. It does not suit anybody.&quot;

==Economics==
Ambedkar was the first Indian to pursue a doctorate in economics abroad. He argued that industrialisation and agricultural growth could enhance the Indian economy. He stressed investment in agriculture as the primary industry of India. Ambedkar advocated national economic and social development, stressing education, public hygiene, community health, residential facilities as the basic amenities. His DSc thesis, &quot;The problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Solution&quot; (1923) examines the causes for the Rupee&#x27;s fall in value. In this dissertation, he argued in favour of a gold standard in modified form, and was opposed to the gold-exchange standard favoured by Keynes in his treatise &quot;Indian Currency and Finance&quot; (1909), claiming it was less stable. He favoured the stoppage of all further coinage of the rupee and the minting of a gold coin, which he believed would fix currency rates and prices.

He also analysed revenue in his PhD dissertation &quot;The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India&quot;. In this work, he analysed the various systems used by the British colonial government to manage finances in India. His views on finance were that governments should ensure their expenditures have &quot;faithfulness, wisdom and economy.&quot; &quot;Faithfulness&quot; meaning governments should use money as nearly as possible to the original intentions of spending the money in the first place. &quot;Wisdom&quot; meaning it should be used as well as possible for the public good, and &quot;economy&quot; meaning the funds should be used so that the maximum value can be extracted from them.

Ambedkar opposed income tax for low-income groups. He contributed in Land Revenue Tax and excise duty policies to stabilise the economy. He played an important role in land reform and the state economic development. According to him, the caste system, due to its division of labourers and hierarchical nature, impedes movement of labour (higher castes would not do lower-caste occupations) and movement of capital (assuming investors would invest first in their own caste occupation). His theory of State Socialism had three points: state ownership of agricultural land, the maintenance of resources for production by the state, and a just distribution of these resources to the population. He emphasised a free economy with a stable Rupee which India has adopted recently. He advocated birth control to develop the Indian economy, and this has been adopted by Indian government as national policy for family planning. He emphasised equal rights for women for economic development.

A number of Ambedkar&#x27;s ideas reflected deep interest in Austrian school of economics. The ideas of Ambedkar were close to those of Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and William Graham Sumner. Ambedkar&#x27;s theory of free banking was built on Menger&#x27;s work and also on Gopal Krishna Gokhale&#x27;s treatise on finance and money. Ambedkar&#x27;s view about distinguishing differential quality of money was influenced by Menger&#x27;s idea of sale-ability of money which is found in Menger&#x27;s article &#x27;On the Origin of Money&#x27;. Ambedkar&#x27;s recommendations for free banking were ignored by both Royal Commission and Indian government.

In his book, &quot;The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India&quot;, Ambedkar wrote &quot;a Central Government for the whole of India could not be said to possess knowledge and experience of all various conditions prevailing in different Provinces under it. It, therefore, necessarily becomes an authority less competent to deal with matters of provincial administration than the Provisional Governments.&#x27;

Ambedkar&#x27;s views on agricultural land was that too much of it was idle, or that it was not being utilized properly. He believed there was an &quot;ideal proportion&quot; of production factors that would allow agricultural land to be used most productively. To this end, he saw the large portion of people who lived on agriculture at the time as a major problem. Therefore, he advocated industrialization of the economy to allow these agricultural labourers to be of more use elsewhere. Ambedkar was of the view that there is a need to shift surplus labour from agricultural channels to non-agricultural channels.

Ambedkar was trained as an economist, and was a professional economist until 1921, when he became a political leader. He wrote three books on economics:
* &quot;Administration and Finance of the East India Company&quot;
* &quot;The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India&quot;
* &quot;The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution&quot;

==Marriage==
Ambedkar&#x27;s first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India&#x27;s constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had neuropathic pain in his legs, and was taking insulin and homoeopathic medicines. He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met Sharada Kabir, whom he married on 15 April 1948, at his home in New Delhi. Doctors recommended a companion who was a good cook and had medical knowledge to care for him. She adopted the name Savita Ambedkar and cared for him the rest of his life. Savita Ambedkar, who was called also &#x27;Mai&#x27;, died on 29 May 2003, aged 93 in Mumbai.

==Conversion to Buddhism==

Ambedkar considered converting to Sikhism, which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes. But after meeting with Sikh leaders, he concluded that he might get &quot;second-rate&quot; Sikh status.

Instead, around 1950, he began devoting his attention to Buddhism and travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to attend a meeting of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. While dedicating a new Buddhist vihara near Pune, Ambedkar announced he was writing a book on Buddhism, and that when it was finished, he would formally convert to Buddhism. He twice visited Burma in 1954; the second time to attend the third conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists in Rangoon. In 1955, he founded the Bharatiya Bauddha Mahasabha, or the Buddhist Society of India. In 1956, he completed his final work, &quot;The Buddha and His Dhamma&quot;, which was published posthumously.

After meetings with the Sri Lankan Buddhist monk Hammalawa Saddhatissa, Ambedkar organised a formal public ceremony for himself and his supporters in Nagpur on 14 October 1956. Accepting the Three Refuges and Five Precepts from a Buddhist monk in the traditional manner, Ambedkar completed his own conversion, along with his wife. He then proceeded to convert some 500,000 of his supporters who were gathered around him. He prescribed the 22 Vows for these converts, after the Three Jewels and Five Precepts. He then travelled to Kathmandu, Nepal to attend the Fourth World Buddhist Conference. His work on &quot;The Buddha or Karl Marx&quot; and &quot;Revolution and counter-revolution in ancient India&quot; remained incomplete.

==Death==
Since 1948, Ambedkar had diabetes. He remained in bed from June to October in 1954 due to medication side-effects and poor eyesight. His health worsened during 1955. Three days after completing his final manuscript &quot;The Buddha and His Dhamma&quot;, Ambedkar died in his sleep on 6 December 1956 at his home in Delhi.

A Buddhist cremation was organised at Dadar Chowpatty beach on 7 December, attended by half a million grieving people. A conversion program was organised on 16 December 1956, so that cremation attendees were also converted to Buddhism at the same place.

Ambedkar was survived by his second wife Savita Ambedkar (known as Maisaheb Ambedkar), who died in 2003, and his son Yashwant Ambedkar (known as Bhaiyasaheb Ambedkar), who died in 1977. Savita and Yashwant carried on the socio-religious movement started by B. R. Ambedkar. Yashwant served as the 2nd President of the Buddhist Society of India (1957–1977) and a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council (1960–1966). Ambedkar&#x27;s elder grandson, Prakash Yashwant Ambedkar, is the chief-adviser of the Buddhist Society of India, leads the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi and has served in both houses of the Indian Parliament. Ambedkar&#x27;s younger grandson, Anandraj Ambedkar leads the Republican Sena (tran: The &quot;Republican Army&quot;).

A number of unfinished typescripts and handwritten drafts were found among Ambedkar&#x27;s notes and papers and gradually made available. Among these were &quot;Waiting for a Visa&quot;, which probably dates from 1935 to 1936 and is an autobiographical work, and the &quot;Untouchables, or the Children of India&#x27;s Ghetto&quot;, which refers to the census of 1951.

A memorial for Ambedkar was established in his Delhi house at 26 Alipur Road. His birthdate known as &quot;Ambedkar Jayanti&quot; or &quot;Bhim Jayanti&quot; is observed as a public holiday in many Indian states. He was posthumously awarded India&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1990.

On the anniversary of his birth and death, and on Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din (14 October) at Nagpur, at least half a million people gather to pay homage to him at his memorial in Mumbai. Thousands of bookshops are set up, and books are sold. His message to his followers was &quot;educate, agitate, organise!&quot;

==Legacy==

Ambedkar&#x27;s legacy as a socio-political reformer had a deep effect on modern India. In post-Independence India, his socio-political thought is respected across the political spectrum. His initiatives have influenced various spheres of life and transformed the way India today looks at socio-economic policies, education and affirmative action through socio-economic and legal incentives. His reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as free India&#x27;s first law minister, and chairman of the committee for drafting the constitution. He passionately believed in individual freedom and criticised caste society. His accusations of Hinduism as being the foundation of the caste system made him controversial and unpopular among Hindus. His conversion to Buddhism sparked a revival in interest in Buddhist philosophy in India and abroad.

Many public institutions are named in his honour, and the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport in Nagpur, otherwise known as Sonegaon Airport. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, Ambedkar University Delhi is also named in his honour.

The Maharashtra government has acquired a house in London where Ambedkar lived during his days as a student in the 1920s. The house is expected to be converted into a museum-cum-memorial to Ambedkar.

Ambedkar was voted &quot;the Greatest Indian&quot; since independence by a poll organised by History TV18 and CNN IBN, ahead of Patel and Nehru, in 2012. Nearly 20 million votes were cast. Due to his role in economics, Narendra Jadhav, a notable Indian economist, has said that Ambedkar was &quot;the highest educated Indian economist of all times.&quot; Amartya Sen, said that Ambedkar is &quot;father of my economics&quot;, and &quot;he was highly controversial figure in his home country, though it was not the reality. His contribution in the field of economics is marvelous and will be remembered forever.&quot;

On 2 April 1967, an 3.66 metre (12 foot) tall bronze statue of Ambedkar was installed in the Parliament of India. The statue, sculpted by B.V. Wagh, was unveiled by the then President of India, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. On 12 April 1990, a portrait of B.R. Ambedkar is put in the Central Hall of Parliament House. The portrait of Ambedkar, painted by Zeba Amrohawi, was unveiled by the then Prime Minister of India, V. P. Singh. Another portrait of Ambedkar is put in the Parliamentary Museum and archives of the Parliament House.

Ambedkar&#x27;s legacy was not without criticism. Ambedkar has been criticised for his one-sided views on the issue of caste at the expense of cooperation with the larger nationalist movement. Ambedkar has been also criticised by some of his biographers over his neglect of organization-building.

Ambedkar&#x27;s political philosophy has given rise to a large number of political parties, publications and workers&#x27; unions that remain active across India, especially in Maharashtra. His promotion of Buddhism has rejuvenated interest in Buddhist philosophy among sections of population in India. Mass conversion ceremonies have been organised by human rights activists in modern times, emulating Ambedkar&#x27;s Nagpur ceremony of 1956. Some Indian Buddhists regard him as a Bodhisattva, although he never claimed it himself. Outside India, during the late 1990s, some Hungarian Romani people drew parallels between their own situation and that of the downtrodden people in India. Inspired by Ambedkar, they started to convert to Buddhism.

The Ambedkar Statue in Hyderabad is a statue of B. R. Ambedkar located in Hyderabad. The statue was designed by Ram V. Sutar. The foundation stone was laid in 2016, but the construction of the statue began in 2021. The statue was inaugurated on 14 April 2023, by K. Chandrashekhar Rao, the Chief Minister of Telangana, on the 132nd Ambedkar Jayanti. Ambedkar&#x27;s grandson Prakash Ambedkar was the chief guest of the event. The statue is made up of over 360 tonnes of steel and 100 tonnes of bronze. On 19 January 2024, a 125 feet tall &quot;Statue of Social Justice&quot; of Ambedkar was installed in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, which stands on an 81 feet high platform. The Ambedkar statues in Hyderabad and Vijayawada are the fifth and fourth tallest statues in India respectively. In May 2026, a 450 feet tall &quot;Statue of Equality&quot; of Babasaheb Ambedkar will be ready at Indu Mill in Mumbai, which will be the second tallest statue in India and the third tallest in the world.

==Views==

===Religion===

Ambedkar said in 1935 that he was born a Hindu but would not die a Hindu. He viewed Hinduism as an &quot;oppressive religion&quot; and started to consider conversion to any other religion. In &quot;Annihilation of Caste&quot;, Ambedkar claims that the only lasting way a true casteless society could be achieved is through destroying the belief of the sanctity of the &quot;Shastras&quot; and denying their authority. Ambedkar was critical of Hindu religious texts and epics and wrote a work titled &quot;Riddles in Hinduism&quot; during 1954–1955. The work was published posthumously by combining individual chapter manuscripts and resulted in mass demonstrations and counter demonstrations.

Ambedkar viewed Christianity to be incapable of fighting injustices. He wrote that &quot;It is an incontrovertible fact that Christianity was not enough to end the slavery of the Negroes in the United States. A civil war was necessary to give the Negro the freedom which was denied to him by the Christians.&quot;

Ambedkar criticized distinctions within Islam and described the religion as &quot;a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction&quot;.

He opposed conversions of depressed classes to convert to Islam or Christianity added that if they converted to Islam then &quot;the danger of Muslim domination also becomes real&quot; and if they converted to Christianity then it &quot;will help to strengthen the hold of Britain on the country&quot;.

Initially, Ambedkar planned to convert to Sikhism but he rejected this idea after he discovered that British government would not guarantee the privileges accorded to the untouchables in reserved parliamentary seats.

On 16 October 1956, he converted to Buddhism just weeks before his death.

===Aryan invasion theory===
Ambedkar viewed the Shudras as Aryan and adamantly rejected the Aryan invasion theory, describing it as &quot;so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago&quot; in his 1946 book &quot;Who Were the Shudras?&quot;. Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally having been &quot;part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society&quot;, but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on Brahmins.

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being outside India, and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself. According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.

===Communism===
Ambedkar&#x27;s views on Communism were expressed in two 1956 texts, &quot;Buddha or Karl Marx&quot; and &quot;Buddhism and Communism&quot;. He accepted the Marxist theory that the privileged few&#x27;s exploitation of the masses perpetuated poverty and its issues. However, he did not see this exploitation as purely economic, theorizing that the cultural aspects of exploitation are as bad or worse than economic exploitation. In addition, he did not see economic relationships as the only important aspect of human life. He also saw Communists as willing to resort to any means to achieve proletarian revolution, including violence, while he himself saw democratic and peaceful measures as the best option for change. Ambedkar also opposed the Marxist idea of controlling all the means of production and ending private ownership of property: seeing the latter measure as not able to fix the problems of society. In addition, rather than advocating for the eventual annihilation of the state as Marxism does, Ambedkar believed in a classless society, but also believed the state would exist as long as society and that it should be active in development. But in the 1950s, in an interview he gave to BBC, he accepted that the current liberal democratic system will collapse and the alternative, as he thinks, &quot;is some kind of communism&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Several films, plays, and other works have been based on the life and thoughts of Ambedkar.

<text>Arleigh Albert Burke (October 19, 1901 – January 1, 1996) was an admiral of the United States Navy who distinguished himself during World War II and the Korean War, and who served as Chief of Naval Operations during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations.

, the lead ship of her class of Aegis-equipped guided missile destroyers, was commissioned in Burke&#x27;s honor in 1991. The honor of naming a US naval vessel after a living figure was only the fourth time it had been bestowed since 1861.

==Early life and naval career==

Burke was born in Boulder, Colorado, on October 19, 1901, to Oscar Burke and Clara Mokler. His grandfather, August Björkgren, was a Swedish immigrant to the US and changed his surname to &#x27;Burke&#x27;, a common Irish surname, to sound more &#x27;American&#x27;. Due to the 1918 influenza outbreak, schools were closed in Boulder and he never graduated from high school. Burke won an alternate appointment to the United States Naval Academy given by his local congressman. During his time at the academy, Burke was a member of 23rd Company. He graduated from the academy in June 1923, and was commissioned as an ensign in the United States Navy. He married Roberta Gorsuch (1899–1997) of Washington, D.C.

Over the next 18 years, Burke served aboard battleships and destroyers, and earned a Master of Science degree in chemical engineering at the University of Michigan in 1931. When World War II came, he found himself, to his great disappointment, in a shore billet at the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C. After persistent efforts on his part, in 1943 he received orders to join the fighting in the South Pacific.

==World War II==
Burke spent the remainder of the war in the South Pacific. He successively commanded Destroyer Division 43, Destroyer Division 44, Destroyer Squadron 12, and Destroyer Squadron 23. DesRon 23, known as the &quot;Little Beavers&quot;, covered the initial landings in Bougainville in November 1943, and fought in 22 separate engagements during the next four months. During this time, the Little Beavers were credited with destroying one Japanese cruiser, nine destroyers, one submarine, several smaller ships, and approximately 30 aircraft. Burke&#x27;s standing orders to his task force were, &quot;Destroyers to attack on enemy contact WITHOUT ORDERS from the task force commander.&quot; After reviewing the Navy&#x27;s early unsuccessful engagements with the Japanese, he concluded that uncertainty and hesitation had cost them dearly. The lesson was driven home to him at the Battle of Blackett Strait, when his radar operator made first contact with a ship near the shore but Burke hesitated to fire. A battle soon unfolded which ended in a US victory, which only Burke was unhappy with. Reflecting on the events Burke asked a nearby ensign what the difference was between a good officer and a poor one. After listening to the ensign&#x27;s response, Burke offered his own: &quot;The difference between a good officer and a poor one,&quot; said Burke, &quot;is about ten seconds.&quot;

Burke usually pushed his destroyers to just under boiler-bursting speed, but while en route to a rendezvous prior to the Battle of Cape St. George the became a boiler casualty (a boiler tube was blocked by a brush used for cleaning), limiting Burke&#x27;s squadron to 31 knots, rather than the 34+ of which they were otherwise capable. His nickname was &quot;31 Knot Burke,&quot; originally a taunt, later a popular symbol of his hard-charging nature. An alternative explanation is provided by Jean Edward Smith in his biography of Eisenhower: &quot;During World War Two, Burke mistakenly led his destroyer squadron into a Japanese minefield. Admiral Halsey radioed to ask what he was doing in a Japanese minefield. ‘Thirty-one knots,’ replied Burke”.

In March 1944, Burke was promoted to Chief of Staff to the Commander of Task Force 58, the Fifth Fleet&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force, which was commanded by Admiral Marc Mitscher. The transfer stemmed from a directive from the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Ernest King, that required a surface commander such as Admiral Raymond A. Spruance to have an aviator as Chief of Staff, and an air commander, such as Mitscher, to have a surface officer as Chief of Staff. Neither Mitscher nor Burke were happy with the arrangement, but as time passed Burke realized he had been given one of the most important assignments in the Navy, and his hard work and diligence eventually caused Mitscher to warm to him. Burke was promoted to the temporary rank of Commodore, and participated in all the force&#x27;s naval engagements until June 1945, near the end of the war. He was aboard both and when they were hit by Japanese kamikaze aircraft during the Okinawa campaign.

After the end of the war, Burke reverted to his permanent rank of captain and continued his naval career by serving in a number of capacities, including once more as Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s chief of staff, until the latter&#x27;s death in 1947. Burke then took command of the cruiser for a cruise down the east coast of Africa. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1949 and served as Navy Secretary on the Defense Research and Development Board.

==Korean War==
At the outbreak of the Korean War, Admiral Forrest Sherman, then Chief of Naval Operations, ordered Burke to duty as Deputy Chief of Staff to Commander Naval Forces Far East. From there, he assumed command of Cruiser Division Five, and, in July 1951, was made a member of the United Nations Truce Delegation which negotiated with the Communists for military armistice in Korea. After six months in the truce tents, he returned to the Office of Chief of Naval Operations where he served as Director of Strategic Plans Division until 1954.

In April 1954, he took command of Cruiser Division Six, then moved in January 1955 to command Destroyer Force Atlantic Fleet (DesLant). In August 1955, Burke succeeded Admiral Robert B. Carney as Chief of Naval Operations. At the time of his appointment as Chief of Naval Operations, Burke was still a rear admiral (two stars) and was promoted over the heads of many Flag Officers who were senior to him. Burke had never served as a vice admiral (three stars), so he was promoted two grades at the time of his appointment.

==Chief of Naval Operations==

Burke took the post of Chief of Naval Operations in May, 1955, with significant reservations. He served at a critical time in world history, during the depths of the Cold War. He was relatively young, age 53, compared to other Flag Officers at the time. He was a hard worker, and seemingly tireless, working fifteen-hour work days six days a week as a norm.

He was also an excellent leader and manager, and his ability to create an effective organization were keys to his success. He supported the notoriously demanding Admiral Hyman Rickover in the development of a nuclear-powered submarine force, and instituted the development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which led to the Polaris missile program, headed by Burke&#x27;s selectee Rear Admiral W. F. &quot;Red&quot; Raborn. Burke convened the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference in 1956 at the suggestion of Columbus Iselin II, director of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. At the conference, a statement by Edward Teller that a physically small one-megaton warhead suitable for Polaris could be developed led to Burke&#x27;s adoption of Polaris over Jupiter. At a time when others in the Navy were very skeptical of the idea of a missile launched from a submarine, Burke succeeded in developing the single most effective deterrent to a nuclear attack on the United States. By 1961 routine Polaris deterrent patrols were in progress and a rapid construction program of Polaris submarines was underway.

Burke as Chief of Naval Operations was intimately involved in the Eisenhower administration discussions on limiting the size of the submarine force. Asked &quot;how much is enough?&quot;, as to the number of US ballistic missile submarines needed for deterrence, Burke argued that a force of around 40 Polaris submarines (each with 16 missiles) was a reasonable answer. Burke further argued that land-based missiles and bombers were vulnerable to attack, which made the U.S.-Soviet nuclear balance dangerously unstable. By contrast, nuclear submarines were virtually undetectable and invulnerable. He was very critical of &quot;hair trigger&quot; or &quot;launch on warning&quot; nuclear strategies, and he warned that such strategies were &quot;dangerous for any nation.&quot;

Burke served an unprecedented three terms as Chief of Naval Operations during a period of growth and progress in the Navy. Upon completing his third term, he was transferred to the Retired List on August 1, 1961.

==Last years==
Burke, of Swedish descent, was the senior representative of the United States of America at the funeral of King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden in 1973.

Arleigh Burke died on January 1, 1996, at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He was 94 years old. He is buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery, in Annapolis, Maryland.

==Awards and honors==
===Ship class namesake===
, the lead ship of her class of Aegis-equipped guided missile destroyers, was commissioned in his honor in 1991. In 1985, a few months after the ship was ordered, an early keel-laying ceremony was held at Bath Iron Works. Burke marked his initials on material that was later incorporated at the physical keel-laying on December 6, 1988. Burke was one of the very few individuals to be honored by a ship named after them during their lifetime.

The Assisted Living section of the Vinson Hall Retirement Community in McLean, Virginia, is named the Arleigh Burke Pavilion in his honor.

==Medals==




Burke received numerous combat awards during his forty-two years in the Navy, including the Navy Cross, Navy Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, and the Purple Heart. None were more cherished than two awards that came early in his career. In 1928, while serving aboard , he was commended for the &quot;rescue of shipwrecked and seafaring men.&quot; In 1939 during his first command, , he was commended when his destroyer won the fleet gunnery trophy with the highest score in many years. His ship also stood third in engineering competition and high in communication competition.

For his service in Destroyer Squadron 23, Burke was awarded the Navy Cross, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the squadron. The citations follow in part:
;Navy Cross
;Navy Distinguished Service Medal
;Legion of Merit
As Chief of Staff, Commander Fast Carrier Task Force, Pacific (Task Force 38), Burke was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Distinguished Service Medal, the Silver Star, a Gold Star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit, and a Letter of Commendation, with authorization to wear the Commendation Ribbon. The citations follow in part:
;Silver Star
;Gold Star in lieu of second Legion of Merit
;Letter of Commendation
From September 1950 until May 1951, Burke served as Deputy Chief of Staff to Commander U.S. Naval Forces, Far East, and, for &quot;exceptionally meritorious conduct (in that capacity) from September 3, 1950, to January 1, 1951&quot; he was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a third Legion of Merit. The citation further states:
While serving as Commander Cruiser Division Five from May to September 1951, and also as a Member of the Military Armistice Commission in Korea, Burke was awarded an oak leaf cluster in lieu of a fourth Legion of Merit by the Army (Headquarters U.S. Army Forces, Far East) by General Order #5, as follows:
Burke was presented a Gold Star in lieu of a third Distinguished Service Medal by President John F. Kennedy at the White House on July 26, 1961. On January 10, 1977, Burke was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford.

===Presidential Unit Citations===
Burke was also entitled to wear the Presidential Unit Citations presented to Destroyer Squadron 23, , , and to . Those vessels were, at various times during his period of service, flagships of the Fast Carrier Task Forces in the Pacific. The citation for the citation to Destroyer Squadron 23 reads:
===Other awards===
In addition to the above, Burke earned the American Defense Service Medal with &quot;Fleet&quot; clasp, the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two silver stars and two bronze stars (twelve engagements); the American Campaign Medal; World War II Victory Medal; Navy Occupation Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal with bronze star (Admiral Burke became retroactively eligible for a second award after his retirement); Korean Service Medal with bronze battle star; the Philippine Liberation Medal with bronze service star; and the United Nations Korea Medal. He was awarded the &quot;Ui Chi Medal&quot; and the Presidential Unit Citation from the Republic of Korea as well as the Order of the Rising Sun, First Class by the Government of Japan. In 1960 he received the Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav from the Norwegian King. In 1999 Admiral Burke became posthumously eligible for the Korean War Service Medal awarded by the Republic of Korea.

==Legacy==
In 1962, Burke co-founded the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C., with David Abshire. CSIS hosts the Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy, which &quot;provides political and military analysis of key strategic challenges facing the United States and the world.&quot; It is held as of 2013 by Anthony Cordesman.

Burke was elected as an honorary member of the New York State Society of Cincinnati in 1964.

In 1991 Burke was awarded the Lone Sailor Award by the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation for his distinguished career during World War II and the Korean War.

The , a guided-missile destroyer of the United States Navy and lead ship of her class, was named in his honor. The class is one of the most advanced in service and is one of only two destroyer classes currently in active US Navy service.

An elementary school was named in his honor in Boulder; it was closed in 1982. Thunderbird Park, also in Boulder, was renamed &quot;Admiral Arleigh A. Burke Memorial Park&quot; in 1997. In October 2001, a dedication of the memorial was held, featuring a 12-foot, 26,000-pound anchor from a World War II destroyer, a memorial wall containing a bronze relief sculpture of the admiral and a plaque with his biography.

The Navy annually awards the Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy to &quot;the ship or aircraft squadron from each coast selected for having achieved the greatest improvement in battle efficiency during the calendar year, based upon the Battle Efficiency Competition.&quot; Winning the Battle &quot;E&quot; is not a prerequisite.

The United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp pane on February 4, 2010, honoring distinguished sailors. In addition to Burke, the other persons on the stamp pane were Admiral William S. Sims, Lieutenant Commander John McCloy, and Officer&#x27;s Cook Third Class Doris Miller.

<doc id="197530" wikidata="Q7621052" url="?curid=197530" title="Straight Up (Badfinger album)">
<text>Straight Up is the fourth studio album by the Welsh rock band Badfinger, released in December 1971 in the United States and February 1972 in Britain. Issued on the Beatles&#x27; Apple record label, it includes the hit singles &quot;Day After Day&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, and the similarly popular &quot;Name of the Game&quot;, all of which were written by singer and guitarist Pete Ham. The album marked a departure from the more rock-oriented sound of Badfinger&#x27;s previous releases, partly as a result of intervention by Apple Records regarding the band&#x27;s musical direction.

Production on what became &quot;Straight Up&quot; lasted nine months, at the start of which the group made an album&#x27;s worth of recordings with producer Geoff Emerick, in between their touring commitments. Once Apple had decided to shelve these recordings, George Harrison took over production, only for him to become preoccupied with organizing the Concert for Bangladesh, at which Badfinger also performed. Harrison then handed the project to American producer Todd Rundgren, who oversaw recording for most of the album.

Although &quot;Straight Up&quot; received a mixed response from critics on release, many reviewers now regard it as the band&#x27;s best album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic David Fricke has referred to it as &quot;Badfinger&#x27;s power-pop apex&quot;. The album was reissued on CD in 1993, with bonus tracks, and remastered again in 2010.

==Background==
Badfinger preceded the recording of their third album, &quot;Straight Up&quot;, with the well-received &quot;No Dice&quot; (1970), and a series of acclaimed shows at Urgano&#x27;s in New York that helped establish the group in America. Out of appreciation for the band&#x27;s contributions to his first post-Beatles solo album, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, George Harrison introduced Badfinger on their opening night at Urgano&#x27;s, about which Janis Schacht of &quot;Circus&quot; reported: &quot;For a while, most people watched George Harrison watching Badfinger, then everyone noticed how good Badfinger were – good enough to draw attention away from a former Beatle.&quot;

While attractive to American audiences, the association with the Beatles, partly through Badfinger being an Apple Records act, continued to hinder the band&#x27;s attempts to forge their own identity. Having already tired of playing their debut hit song, the Paul McCartney-written &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, Badfinger would experience similar artistic compromises during the production of &quot;Straight Up&quot;. In other areas of the group&#x27;s operation, all four members signed a management deal with American agent Stan Polley in November 1970, and the band hired part of Clearwell Castle in Gloucestershire as a base for songwriting and rehearsing.

==Recording==

===Rejected recordings with Geoff Emerick===
Initial sessions for the new album began in January 1971 at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios, under the direction of Geoff Emerick, who had produced the bulk of &quot;No Dice&quot;. The band also worked at Command Studios in central London and at AIR Studios, the facility owned by former Beatles producer George Martin. Twelve tracks from these Emerick-produced sessions were completed by March, with the band rushing to finish the untitled album before reluctantly leaving for a two-month US tour that Polley had booked.

The Pete Ham-written &quot;Name of the Game&quot; was scheduled for release as a single – only for Phil Spector, as de facto head of A&amp;R at Apple, to cancel the release. According to author Richard Williams, Spector deemed the track an inadequate follow-up to the band&#x27;s hit single off &quot;No Dice&quot;, &quot;No Matter What&quot;. Although Badfinger guitarist Joey Molland has said that Harrison was responsible for the Emerick recordings being rejected,&lt;ref name=&quot;StraightUp/Apple&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the band&#x27;s biographer, Dan Matovina, writes that the rejection had in fact come from Allan Steckler, head of Apple&#x27;s US operation, where most of the record label&#x27;s decisions were now made. Spector and Harrison submitted a remixed version of &quot;Name of the Game&quot; on 23 April, which also met with disapproval from Steckler. While the band were in New York during the tour, they attended a session at Bell Studio, where Al Kooper overdubbed piano and organ onto the track; Kooper&#x27;s subsequent mix of the song was similarly unsuccessful.

Knowing that Harrison rated the band highly, Steckler asked him to work with the group. Apple thereby shelved the Emerick-produced album,&lt;ref name=&quot;RecCollect/Aug04&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (&quot;subscription required&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; six songs from which Badfinger would re-record for the eventual release. In a January 1972 interview with &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot;, Ham reflected that the band had realised after this 1971 tour that they were unhappy with the initial sessions, saying: &quot;we tried to do an album [in between tours] and we didn&#x27;t have enough time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Disc/Jan 72&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (&quot;subscription required&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sessions with George Harrison and the Concert for Bangladesh===
Harrison was keen to see the band create a more mature work in the style of the Beatles&#x27; 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, a vision that Ham shared. From 30 May, Badfinger worked with their new producer at Abbey Road, taping four of the twelve songs eventually issued on &quot;Straight Up&quot;. The tracks were new versions of &quot;Name of the Game&quot; and &quot;Suitcase&quot;, the latter written by Molland and also previously recorded with Emerick; &quot;Day After Day&quot;, a new love song by Ham; and the Molland composition &quot;I&#x27;d Die Babe&quot;.

Molland later recalled that Harrison virtually &quot;joined the band&quot;, by contributing on guitar during these sessions. Harrison was particularly drawn to &quot;Day After Day&quot;, on which he performed a slide guitar duet with Ham. Later, he added a piano overdub by Leon Russell, whom Badfinger had supported on their recent US tour. Harrison played acoustic and electric guitars on &quot;I&#x27;d Die Babe&quot;, and provided the musical arrangement for &quot;Suitcase&quot;. Another outside musician, Klaus Voormann, contributed the electric piano part on &quot;Suitcase&quot;, which featured Russell playing guitar.

The band took a break from recording late in June, as Harrison worked in Los Angeles with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, producing the soundtrack to &quot;Raga&quot;. At Shankar&#x27;s urgent request, Harrison agreed to stage the Concert for Bangladesh in New York, and so flew back to London on 12 July to explain to Badfinger that he would be unable to complete his work on &quot;Straight Up&quot;, while inviting them to play at the benefit concerts on 1 August. Reprising their roles from the &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; sessions, Ham, Tom Evans and Molland performed as acoustic rhythm guitarists at the shows and Mike Gibbins played percussion. In addition, despite having had no rehearsal beforehand, Ham duetted with Harrison on an acoustic version of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;.

===Sessions with Todd Rundgren and album completion===
During September 1971, with Harrison embroiled in preparing the Bangladesh live album and concert film for release, Apple hired Todd Rundgren to finish Badfinger&#x27;s album. According to Ham, Rundgren had met Harrison in New York and expressed interest in working with the group.

In addition to working with Rundgren in London on some more recent compositions, the band re-recorded two songs from the Emerick sessions: &quot;Money&quot;, written by Evans, and Ham&#x27;s &quot;Perfection&quot;. Two tracks were holdovers from the Geoff Emerick sessions: Rundgren re-mixed and sped up &quot;Flying&quot;, while &quot;Sweet Tuesday Morning&quot;, Molland&#x27;s love song to his wife Kathie, was overdubbed and remixed. All these tracks appeared on the released album, as did the new songs &quot;Take It All&quot;, Ham&#x27;s reflection on performing at the Concert for Bangladesh, and the opening track to &quot;Straight Up&quot;; &quot;Sometimes&quot;, by Molland; and &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, Evans&#x27; tribute to the band&#x27;s American fans. The other new recording was &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, written by Ham and likewise inspired by the recent US tour. Rundgren worked quickly on the project, completing the recordings in two weeks. Rather than an easy collaboration, however, the sessions with Rundgren created what Terry Staunton of &quot;Record Collector&quot; describes as &quot;studio friction between the American [producer] and his charges&quot;.

Rundgren did the final mix for the whole album. He was upset not to receive a co-production credit for any of the Harrison-produced tracks, later telling author Peter Doggett: &quot;[Harrison] didn&#x27;t finish any of the songs, though he was perfectly willing to take the credit for the songs that I finished.&quot; Although admiring of Rundgren&#x27;s technical abilities in the studio, Badfinger were vocal in their opposition to his working methods; Matovina wrote in a 1979 article for &quot;Trouser Press&quot;: &quot;According to the band, he was totally domineering and had little respect for their ideas. Todd made the album slick and simple, and an abundance of the group’s natural energy was lost.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Matovina/1979&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; While Ham was especially positive about working with Harrison, and Molland described it as &quot;a great experience, he was a master in the studio … very encouraging and co-operative&quot;, Molland has also rued the band&#x27;s loss of creative control, such that the result was far from their original vision.

==Release==
Apple released &quot;Straight Up&quot; on 13 December 1971 in America (with Apple catalogue number SW 3387) and on 11 February 1972 in Britain (as Apple SAPCOR 19). The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Day After Day&quot; backed with &quot;Money&quot;, was issued on 10 November 1971 in the United States, but the single was delayed until 14 January in the UK, where the B-side was &quot;Sweet Tuesday Morning&quot;. The album&#x27;s art design was credited to Gene Mahon and Richard DiLello, the last of whom took the group photographs used on the front and rear of the cover. A note on the sleeve offered &quot;special thanks&quot; to Geoff Emerick. The front cover portrait encouraged further comparison with the Beatles, as one commentator described the album as &quot;Badfinger for Sale&quot; in reference to the similarly titled 1964 release by the Beatles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reid/Elsewhere&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, &quot;Straight Up&quot; peaked at number 31 during a 32-week run on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 200 LPs, while it placed inside the top twenty on albums charts in Canada and Australia. &quot;Day After Day&quot; became Badfinger&#x27;s highest-charting single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 4, and was certified gold by the RIAA on 4 March. Although the album failed to place on the UK&#x27;s top 40 albums chart, &quot;Day After Day&quot; was the band&#x27;s third top-ten hit there, peaking at number 10.

As the follow-up single, &quot;Baby Blue&quot; peaked at number 14 on the Hot 100,&lt;ref name=&quot;AM/StraightUp Awards&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Name of the Game&quot; became another popular track on US radio. The album&#x27;s success was marred by a lack of promotion by Apple, which had scheduled &quot;Baby Blue&quot; as a single in the United Kingdom but then cancelled the release.

==Reissue==

===1993===
The album was remastered by Ron Furmanek at Abbey Road in March 1992 and released on CD in June 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brennan/Straight Up&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As bonus tracks, this reissue included the original, Emerick-produced recordings of &quot;Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;Suitcase&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Flying&quot; and &quot;Perfection&quot;. &quot;Record Collector&quot; contributor Andy Davis supplied a liner note essay for the release, with research provided by Matovina.

Among the differences in musical arrangements between the bonus tracks and the 1971-issued versions, &quot;Name of the Game&quot; features horns and orchestration not found on Harrison&#x27;s later production, and &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Flying&quot; similarly have orchestral parts, arranged by George Martin. The lyrics of &quot;Suitcase&quot; include the mention of &quot;pusher&quot; that Harrison had asked Molland to change (in favour of the word &quot;butcher&quot;), to ensure that the song received radio play. &quot;Perfection&quot; features instrumentation such as synthesizer and harmonica, but not the percussion parts found on the Rundgren-produced version. The final bonus track on the 1993 reissue was the US single mix of &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, the main difference being the addition of extra reverberation on Gibbins&#x27; snare drum.

===2010===
In October 2010, &quot;Straight Up&quot; was remastered again for inclusion in the 17-disc &quot;Apple Box Set&quot;. As in 1993, the reissue added the discarded version of &quot;Name of the Game&quot; and the alternate mix of &quot;Baby Blue&quot;. The remaining bonus tracks were all from the January–March 1971 sessions with Emerick. One song had previously appeared on the 1992 &quot;No Dice&quot; CD: &quot;I&#x27;ll Be the One&quot;, written by all four members of the group, and rejected as a possible single after Harrison had deemed it &quot;too Beatley&quot;. The other bonus tracks were all previously unreleased: &quot;Baby, Please&quot;, a collaboration between Ham, Molland and Gibbins; and the Evans compositions &quot;No Good at All&quot; and &quot;Sing for the Song&quot;. In the CD&#x27;s liner notes, again written by Davis, Molland recalls that Emerick and &quot;No Matter What&quot; producer Mal Evans were among the many chorus singers on &quot;Sing for the Song&quot;.

The versions of &quot;Suitcase&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Flying&quot; and &quot;Perfection&quot; from the 1993 reissue appeared in the &quot;Apple Box Set&quot; on a separate bonus disc, comprising 20 rare Badfinger recordings, and were also made available for digital download.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarchesePt5/SecondDisc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also available in these latter formats were three more tracks from the album that Apple had rejected in 1971: an early version of &quot;Sweet Tuesday Morning&quot;, along with &quot;Mean, Mean Jemima&quot; and &quot;Loving You&quot;. The last two songs were written by Molland and Gibbins, respectively, and originally appeared on &quot;No Dice&quot; in 1992. With this 2010 reissue, all of the Emerick-produced tracks have now been officially released.

==Reception==

===Contemporary reviews===
On release in 1971, &quot;Straight Up&quot; was much maligned in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s reviewer, Mike Saunders, previously a champion of the band, called it &quot;a barely decent album, one which is the poorest of Badfinger&#x27;s three LPs and by far the least likeable&quot;. Saunders derided the songwriting and production, and lamented that the group had abandoned its previous &quot;unabashed rock and roll energy&quot;, adding: &quot;With &quot;Straight Up&quot;, Badfinger seem to have already reached the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; stage: a stultifying self-conscious artiness, a loss of previous essential virtues, and far too much general farting around.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot;, Caroline Boucher opined: &quot;Badfinger&#x27;s sound is that of the Beatles in the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; era without the Beatles magic exuberance … The album, overall, doesn&#x27;t have enough light and shade.&quot; Alan Niester of &quot;Creem&quot; described the Harrison-produced tracks as &quot;without exception the stronger&quot; beside Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;more common and forgettable&quot; work, but found the band&#x27;s new sound &quot;a curiously bland and unremarkable blend of guitars, drums, and nubile voices that really doesn’t go anywhere or in much of a blaze of hurry&quot;. While admitting his fondness for the group&#x27;s previous &quot;Beatle rip-offs&quot;, Niester opined: &quot;Badfinger would be better off doing twelve of the Beatles&#x27; greatest hits and doing them without all this pretension of originality.&quot;

Other contemporary reviews compared &quot;Straight Up&quot; to past works by the Beatles in a more favourable light. &quot;Beat Instrumental&quot; described the album as &quot;a good &#x27;un&quot;, and Jim Girard of &quot;Scene&quot; recognised &quot;Perfection&quot; and &quot;Sometimes&quot; as possible singles and said that Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;importance lies in their unpretentiousness and commercial potency&quot;. In the December 1972 issue of &quot;Hit Parader&quot;, Frank Maier praised the album while comparing it to &quot;No Dice&quot;, saying, &quot;The progress is unbelievable and very enjoyable … It holds simplicity and yet has enough complication to keep it from being boring&quot;, and highlighted Harrison&#x27;s &quot;beautiful slide work&quot; on &quot;Day After Day&quot;.

In his 1979 article on the band in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, Dan Matovina bemoaned Harrison&#x27;s reworking of &quot;Day After Day&quot; into &quot;a distinct copy of his own sound&quot;, from the point of view of Badfinger&#x27;s career, while describing the song and &quot;Baby Blue&quot; as &quot;dazzling hits&quot;. Matovina concluded of &quot;Straight Up&quot;: &quot;What came out was a great album due to the tremendous songs, but one which lacked overall vitality. Also, in the process of the recording, many brilliant tracks were discarded ... All the [released] songs are top rate, it&#x27;s a wholly consistent well-done record, only not exactly what the group desired.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews and legacy===

After its mixed reception on release, &quot;Straight Up&quot; has come to be recognised by many critics as Badfinger&#x27;s best album. Reviewing the 1993 CD release, &quot;Q&quot; magazine described &quot;Straight Up&quot; as &quot;brimming with mature melodies and bracing verse/chorus interplay&quot;, and &quot;More complete than their other long-play selections and resplendent with previously unheard gems&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; deemed it &quot;[a] stone cold beauty of an album&quot; and advised: &quot;Love it like your mother …&quot; In a five-star review for the album, William Hanson of MusicHound opined that while &quot;No Dice&quot; &quot;established Ham as a versatile rock vocalist and imaginative songwriter&quot;, &quot;Straight Up&quot; &quot;assured [the band] a spot in pop history&quot; thanks to its &quot;unforgettable&quot; singles.

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes: &quot;Frankly, the increased production is for the best, since Badfinger sounds best when there&#x27;s as much craft in the production as there is in the writing. Here, there&#x27;s absolutely no filler and everybody is in top form. Pete Ham&#x27;s &#x27;Baby Blue&#x27; is textbook power-pop – irresistibly catchy fuzz riffs and sighing melodies – and with its Harrison-esque slide guitars, &#x27;Day After Day&#x27; is so gorgeous it practically aches.&quot; While also highlighting Evans&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot; and particularly Molland&#x27;s &quot;emergence as a songwriter&quot;, Erlewine concludes: &quot;This fine songwriting, combined with sharp performances and exquisite studio craft, make &quot;Straight Up&quot; one of the cornerstones of power pop, a record that proved that it was possible to make classic guitar-pop after its golden era had passed.&quot; Todd Totale of the website Glorious Noise describes &quot;Straight Up&quot; as &quot;impeccably sequenced&quot; and the group&#x27;s &quot;best album&quot;, adding that it &quot;stands tall against even the Beatles&#x27; solo efforts while reaching for [that] band&#x27;s lofty mid-period gems&quot;.

Reviewing the 2010 reissues of Badfinger&#x27;s Apple output, Joe Marchese of The Second Disc writes of their third album: &quot;&quot;Straight Up&quot; might just be Badfinger&#x27;s masterpiece, and its consistency is remarkable considering the three diverse, and strong-willed, producers involved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marchese/SecondDisc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lists &quot;Straight Up&quot; first among his top five non-Beatle Apple albums, describing it as &quot;Badfinger&#x27;s power-pop apex, despite its difficult birth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fricke/RS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for Blogcritics, Glen Boyd opines that &quot;with &quot;Straight Up&quot;, Badfinger delivered one of the first power pop records of the post-Beatles era, and perhaps one of the best of all time&quot;, and admires the remastering of the original album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyd/BC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Viktor Vasilyevich Gorbatko (; 3 December 1934 – 17 May 2017) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew on the Soyuz 7, Soyuz 24, and Soyuz 37 missions.

== Early life ==
Viktor Vasilievich Gorbatko was born on 3 December 1934 to Vasili Pavlovich and Matrena Aleksandrovna Gorbatko. Viktor was raised in the Northern Caucasus settlement of Ventsy-Zarya in the Gulkevich district. Gorbatko had four siblings, an older brother, Boris, two older sisters, Elena and Valentina, and Ludmila, the youngest sibling. Viktor was given the opportunity to learn from Nadezdha Karaulova who taught from ABC books that were often censored by the Nazis of everything that had to do with the Soviet histories. Viktor finished seventh grade in 1949 and then attended a secondary school in the Novokubanski district.

== Personal life and career ==
Viktor&#x27;s interest in becoming a pilot was sparked during the conflict between the Soviets and the Nazis. His siblings often told him stories of brave pilots and their adventures and he too followed in their footsteps. Upon joining the Soviet Army in 1952, Viktor requested to be assigned to flight school. Following his enlisting, Viktor was sent to the 8th Military Aviation School of Pilot Basic Training in the Ukrainian town of Pavlograd, Dnepropetrovsk Region where he was taught to fly. Viktor graduated on 23 June 1956 as a lieutenant in the Soviet air force.

Gorbatko married his first wife Valentina Pavlovna Ordynskaya. Gorbatko also had two children, Irina his first daughter, and Marina, his second daughter, in 1960.

Gorbatko became part of the 86th Guards Fighter Regiment of the 119th Fighter Division, attached to the 48th Air Army operating out of the Odessa Military District in Moldavia. On 22 June 1957 Gorbatko achieved the rank of senior pilot. He would not achieve the senior lieutenant ranking until 6 August 1958, and in October would achieve the military pilots ranking, third class.

Gorbatko was among the first group of Soviet cosmonauts. He began training in early 1960 but he did not reach space until 1967. His first spaceflight was Soyuz 7 from 12 to 17 October 1969 where he was Research Engineer. This mission tested Soviet lunar equipment but a failed docking with Soyuz 8 was the last in-space test before that program was abandoned. Gorbatko was the commander of the 18-day Soyuz 24 mission in February 1977 to the Salyut 5 space station. This was the last all-military spaceflight by the Soviet Union. In 1980, Gorbatko commanded Soyuz 37 which also carried Pham Tuân, the first Vietnamese astronaut. Gorbatko and Pham Tuân flew to Salyut 6 and landed in the Soyuz 36 capsule that had earlier docked at the space station. Gorbatko spent 7 days and 20 hours in space on this mission.

After leaving the space program in 1982 he taught at the Air Force Engineering Academy in Moscow. Upon his death he was buried in the Federal Military Memorial Cemetery.

<doc id="197533" wikidata="Q275376" url="?curid=197533" title="Deep Sea Skiving">
<text>Deep Sea Skiving is the debut studio album by British vocal group Bananarama, released on 7 March 1983 by London Records. The album peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).

The inner-sleeve of the vinyl release contained numerous photos of the group, several of them in childhood. These pictures were reproduced in the 2013 Deluxe Edition CD/DVD re-issue.

On 19 March 2007, Bananarama&#x27;s first six studio albums (including &quot;Deep Sea Skiving&quot;) were re-issued by Rhino Records. All tracks on &quot;Deep Sea Skiving&quot; were remastered and it included several bonus tracks, consisting of B-sides, remixes and a cover of the Sex Pistols song &quot;No Feelings&quot;.

==Background and recording==
Two of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Really Saying Something&quot; and &quot;Aie a Mwana&quot;, were drawn from previously recorded singles. Bananarama recorded three tracks (&quot;Shy Boy&quot;, &quot;Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)&quot;, and &quot;Boy Trouble&quot;) with Jolley &amp; Swain producing, but dismissed the duo in the middle of the album&#x27;s recording and recruited Barry Blue to produce the rest of the album. Siobhan Fahey explained, &quot;[Jolley &amp; Swain] wanted us to do their songs, not ours. They wanted a 1980s version of the old girl groups, disembodied voices. They didn&#x27;t see us as voices with ideas.&quot; Despite this, Jolley &amp; Swain would be brought back as producers for Bananarama&#x27;s next two studio albums.

<doc id="197540" wikidata="Q926142" url="?curid=197540" title="The Band (album)">
<text>The Band, also known as The Brown Album, is the second studio album by the Canadian-American rock band the Band, released on September 22, 1969, by Capitol Records. According to Rob Bowman&#x27;s liner notes for the 2000 reissue, &quot;The Band&quot; has been viewed as a concept album, with the songs focusing on people, places and traditions associated with an older version of Americana. Thus, the songs on this album draw on historic themes for &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come)&quot; and &quot;Jawbone&quot; (which was composed in the unusual 6/4 time signature).

==Recording==
After unsuccessfully attempting sessions at a studio in New York, the Band set up shop in the pool house of a home rented by the group in the Hollywood Hills located at 8850 Evanview Drive in Los Angeles, California. The home was then owned by Sammy Davis Jr. and was previously owned by Judy Garland and Wally Cox. According to Robbie Robertson, the location was chosen to give the songs a &quot;Basement Tapes&quot;–like feel in what was termed &quot;a clubhouse concept&quot;. The last song to be recorded at the pool house was &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come),&quot; as The Band had to leave to perform for three nights at Winterland in San Francisco. Afterwards, they recorded the final three songs to finish the album (&quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;, &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; and &quot;Jemima Surrender&quot;) at The Hit Factory in New York City, at the time operated by Jerry Ragavoy. Joe Zagarino would also take over most of the engineering for the final three tracks they would record, untrusting of Robertson and Simon&#x27;s engineering skills. The outtake &quot;Get Up Jake&quot; was also recorded during these sessions in New York.

According to co-producer John Simon, Robbie Robertson took over most of the engineering for the record, &quot;hungry for knowledge ... I showed him how to make an album from a technical point of view.&quot;

==Release==
The album was originally released on September 22, 1969. A 1980 &quot;Capitol 16000 Series&quot; budget vinyl reissue of the album omitted &quot;When You Awake&quot; and &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come)&quot;.

After several reissues on vinyl, cassette tape, and compact disc, the album was remastered and re-released with bonus tracks in 2000, in a process overseen by Robertson.

&quot;The Band&quot; was reissued in 2009 by Audio Fidelity as a limited edition gold CD. The reissue included a single B-side, &quot;Get Up Jake&quot;, as a bonus track. &quot;Get Up Jake&quot;, which also appears on the 2000 reissue, was slated for inclusion on the original album but was dropped from the lineup at the last minute, either because the band felt it was too similar to another track on the album or because there physically was not enough room on the album. It also was suggested that the underdeveloped status of the song made them decide against inclusion in the album. A reworked version of &quot;Get Up Jake&quot; was later included in many of the Band&#x27;s live performances in the early 1970s and also on the 1972 live album &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;.

In 2019, a 50th Anniversary Edition was released, with an entirely new stereo mix of the album by Bob Clearmountain, mastered by Bob Ludwig, as well as several outtake tracks and the Band&#x27;s entire live set from the Woodstock festival.

The original LP back cover quotes the opening lines from Shelton Brooks&#x27;s 1917 composition &quot;Darktown Strutters&#x27; Ball&quot;.

==Reception==

The album includes many of the Band&#x27;s best-known and critically acclaimed songs, including &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the 245th-greatest song of all time in 2004 and the 249th-greatest song of all time in 2010. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 45 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. In the 2020 update of that list, it was ranked No. 57. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; readers voted &quot;The Band&quot; the 76th greatest album of all time. &quot;Time&quot; included it in their unranked 2006 list of the 100 greatest albums. Robert Christgau, having been disappointed with the Band&#x27;s debut, had expected to dislike the record and even planned a column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; to &quot;castigate&quot; their follow-up. Upon hearing the record, however, he declared it better than &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, which had been released four days following, writing that the Band&#x27;s LP is an &quot;A-plus record if I&#x27;ve ever rated one&quot;. He ranked it as the fourth-best album of the year in his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual critics poll. The album was later included in his &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).
It was voted No. 45 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

&quot;The Band&quot; peaked at No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop Albums chart. In 2000, it charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Internet Albums chart, peaking at No. 10. The singles &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; and &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; peaked on the Pop Singles chart at Nos. 57 and 25 respectively. The &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; single performed better in the UK, where it reached No. 16. It was the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in their native Canada, peaking at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart.

On Metacritic, the expanded 50th anniversary edition of the album has an aggregate score of 96 out of 100, based on six reviews, a rating that the website defines as indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;PopMatters&quot; critic David Pike rated &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot; as one of the &quot;41 essential pop/rock songs with accordion.&quot;

Album - &quot;Billboard&quot; (United States)
Singles - &quot;Billboard&quot; (United States)
In 2009, &quot;The Band&quot; was preserved into the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant, and/or informs or reflects life in the United States&quot;. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. At the 2017 Polaris Music Prize, the album won the jury vote for the Heritage Prize in the 1960-1975 category.

<text>Friedrich Wolfgang Beckey (14 January 1923 – 30 October 2017), known as Fred Beckey, was an American rock climber, mountaineer and book author, who in seven decades of climbing achieved hundreds of first ascents of some of the tallest peaks and most important routes throughout Alaska, the Canadian Rockies and the Pacific Northwest. Among the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America, seven were established by Beckey, often climbing with some of the best known climbers of each generation.

==Early years==
Beckey was born in 1923 near Düsseldorf, Germany to Klaus Beckey, a surgeon, and Marta Maria Beckey who was an opera singer. In 1925 economic hardships due to hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic forced his family to emigrate to the United States, settling in Seattle, Washington. His brother, Helmut &quot;Helmy&quot; Beckey, was born in Seattle in 1926 and would later become Fred&#x27;s frequent climbing partner. At age twelve, Fred Beckey climbed Boulder Peak in the Cascades by himself, after wandering off on a family camping trip. Afterwards, his family signed him up with the Boy Scouts where he learned the basic concepts of climbing. Later he joined The Mountaineers. In 1939, at sixteen, Fred and two friends climbed 7,292-foot Mount Despair in the North Cascades, which was considered unclimbable at the time. In 1942, the teenage Beckey brothers snatched a second ascent of Mount Waddington, which was then considered the most difficult climb in North America. Beckey followed that with many more first ascents of summits in the Olympic and North Cascade ranges. In 1942 he joined 10th Mountain Division, based in Colorado, and served as an instructor.

After the war, Beckey studied business administration at the University of Washington, while still spending a lot of time climbing mountain ranges in the Northwest and desert rock formations in the Southwest. After graduation in 1949 he worked for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; and became a print shop sales representative. However, he soon discovered that his work interfered with his climbing. For a time, he worked as a delivery truck driver, which left him time for climbing. As time went on, he decided that climbing was his life&#x27;s focus. He never married or had children, he never pursued a professional career, he never sought money or financial security as a goal—his goal was to climb mountains.

In 1955 Beckey joined the International Himalayan Expedition to climb the world’s fourth-highest peak, Lhotse. During the expedition his tentmate developed cerebral edema at 23,000 feet on the night before they were to attempt the summit. Beckey descended in the blizzard to get help, but was later blamed by his teammates for abandoning his partner, who was rescued by others. Consequently although Beckey seemed a likely choice as a member for first American Everest Expedition in 1963, he was never invited by his ex-teammates. Afterwards Beckey shied away from the large team efforts abroad, preferring smaller alpine-style undertakings alone or with a few companions seeking out America&#x27;s last unclimbed peaks or striking routes considered too difficult to climb. He often climbed 40 or 50 different summits a year, and over the decades managed to achieve nearly one thousand first ascents.

==Guidebook author==


In the late 1940s, he asked The Mountaineers of Seattle to publish his first climbing guidebook for the local peaks. They turned him down, and the American Alpine Club agreed to print a few thousand copies for a flat fee. Between climbs, he wrote several books, most notably the &quot;Cascade Alpine Guide&quot;, the definitive three-volume description of the Cascades from the Columbia River to the Fraser River, now in its third edition, published by The Mountaineers.

==Later accomplishments==
In 2003, his 563-page book on the history of the region, &quot;Range of Glaciers&quot;, was published by the Oregon Historical Society Press. According to a reviewer, he did much of the research for the volume in Washington, D.C., at the Library of Congress and the National Archives, scouring files of the State Department, U.S. Geological Survey and other agencies. Beckey also perused the Canadian archives in Ottawa, Ontario; Hudson&#x27;s Bay Co. archives in Winnipeg, Manitoba; British Columbia archives in Victoria, British Columbia; records of the Northwest Boundary Survey at Yale University; and records of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railroads in Minneapolis.

Beckey continued climbing when over 90 years old. His life was the subject of a 2017 documentary, directed by David O&#x27;Leske and produced by Patagonia, called &quot;Dirtbag: The Legend of Fred Beckey&quot;. The film won over 26 international awards, including: the Best Feature Mountain Film at the 2017 Banff Mountain Film Festival; the Best Mountaineering Film at the 2017 Kendal Mountain Film Festival; and, the People&#x27;s Choice Award at the 2017 Banff Mountain Book Festival.

Mount Beckey, a previously unnamed, 8,500-foot peak in remote West-Central Alaska Range (), was named after Beckey, after he, Calvin Hebert and John Middendorf climbed it in 1996.

== Death ==
Fred Beckey died of congestive heart failure, in Seattle, on October 30, 2017 at the age of 94.

==Personality==
Timothy Egan captures Fred Beckey&#x27;s personality in a chapter of &quot;The Good Rain&quot;. Beckey named Vasiliki Ridge, by Washington Pass, after his one true love. Beckey was a quintessential dirtbag climber, well captured by a classic portrait of him by Corey Rich from 2004 Patagonia&#x27;s Fall catalog, where he is trying to hitchhike while holding a sign &quot;Will belay for food&quot;. His reputation is well known among many climbers, captured in a T-shirt &quot;Beware of Beckey: He will steal your woman, steal your route.&quot;

<text>A pentagram (sometimes known as a pentalpha, pentangle, or star pentagon) is a regular five-pointed star polygon, formed from the diagonal line segments of a convex (or simple, or non-self-intersecting) regular pentagon. Drawing a circle around the five points creates a similar symbol referred to as the pentacle, which is used widely by Wiccans and in paganism, or as a sign of life and connections. 

The word &quot;pentagram&quot; comes from the Greek word πεντάγραμμον (&quot;pentagrammon&quot;), from πέντε (&quot;pente&quot;), &quot;five&quot; + γραμμή (&quot;grammē&quot;), &quot;line&quot;.
The word pentagram refers to just the star and the word pentacle refers to the star within a circle, although there is some overlap in usage. The word &quot;pentalpha&quot; is a 17th-century revival of a post-classical Greek name of the shape.

==History==

===Early history===
Early pentagrams have been found on Sumerian pottery from Ur c. 3500 BCE, and the five-pointed star was at various times the symbol of Ishtar or Marduk.
Pentagram symbols from about 5,000 years ago were found in the Liangzhu culture of China. A pentagram appeared in a Chinese text on music theory from the Warring States period (221 BC) as a diagram of the mathematical relations between the five notes in a particular Chinese musical scale.

The pentagram was known to the ancient Greeks, with a depiction on a vase possibly dating back to the 7th century BCE. Pythagoreanism originated in the 6th century BCE and used the pentagram as a symbol of mutual recognition, of wellbeing, and to recognize good deeds and charity.

From around 300–150 BCE the pentagram stood as the symbol of Jerusalem, marked by the 5 Hebrew letters ירשלם spelling its name.

In Neoplatonism, the pentagram was said to have been used as a symbol or sign of recognition by the Pythagoreans, who called the pentagram &quot;health&quot;.

===Western symbolism===
====Middle Ages====
The pentagram was used in ancient times as a Christian symbol for the five senses, or of the five wounds of Christ. The pentagram plays an important symbolic role in the 14th-century English poem &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, in which the symbol decorates the shield of the hero, Gawain. The unnamed poet credits the symbol&#x27;s origin to King Solomon, and explains that each of the five interconnected points represents a virtue tied to a group of five: Gawain is perfect in his five senses and five fingers, faithful to the Five Wounds of Christ, takes courage from the five joys that Mary had of Jesus, and exemplifies the five virtues of knighthood, which are generosity, friendship, chastity, chivalry, and piety.

The North rose of Amiens Cathedral (built in the 13th century) exhibits a pentagram-based motif. Some sources interpret the unusual downward-pointing star as symbolizing the Holy Spirit descending on people.

====Renaissance====
Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and others perpetuated the popularity of the pentagram as a magic symbol, attributing the five neoplatonic elements to the five points, in typical Renaissance fashion. Agrippa depicts the human body inscribed in an &#x27;upright&#x27; (point-up) pentagram and another with its hands in rotated pentagrams, among numerous other geometrical figures, in the section on &#x27;the proportions and harmonious measures of the human body&#x27;, and an &#x27;inverted&#x27; (point-down) version of the Pythagorean &#x27;hygeia&#x27; pentagram in the section on &#x27;characters, received only by revelation, which no other kind of reasoning can discover&#x27;, alongside variations of the Chi-Rho and the Hebrew word Makabi.

&#x27;Of this type are the signet shown to Constantine, which most people called a cross, inscribed in Latin letters, &#x27;in this conquer&#x27;, and another revealed to Antiochus who was surnamed Soteris, in the shape of a pentagon, which issued health, for resolved into letters, it issued the word ὑγίεα, that is, &#x27;health&#x27;, in the confidence and virtue of which signs, each of the kings won a notable victory against their enemies. Thus Judas, who for this reason was afterwards known as Maccabeus, was about to fight with the Jews against Antiochus Eupatorus, and received that noble seal מׄכׄבׄיׄ from the angel&#x27;.

====Romanticism====
By the mid-19th century, a further distinction had developed amongst occultists regarding the pentagram&#x27;s orientation. With a single point upwards it depicted spirit presiding over the four elements of matter, and was essentially &quot;good&quot;. However, the influential but controversial writer Éliphas Lévi, known for believing that magic was a real science, had called it evil whenever the symbol appeared the other way up:
*&quot;A reversed pentagram, with two points projecting upwards, is a symbol of evil and attracts sinister forces because it overturns the proper order of things and demonstrates the triumph of matter over spirit. It is the goat of lust attacking the heavens with its horns, a sign execrated by initiates.&quot;
*&quot;The flaming star, which, when turned upside down, is the sign of the goat of black magic, whose head may be drawn in the star, the two horns at the top, the ears to the right and left, the beard at the bottom. It is a sign of antagonism and fatality. It is the goat of lust attacking the heavens with its horns.&quot;
*&quot;Let us keep the figure of the Five-pointed Star always upright, with the topmost triangle pointing to heaven, for it is the seat of wisdom, and if the figure is reversed, perversion and evil will be the result.&quot;

The apotropaic (protective) use in German folklore of the pentagram symbol (called &quot;Drudenfuss&quot; in German) is referred to by Goethe in &quot;Faust&quot; (1808), where a pentagram prevents Mephistopheles from leaving a room (but did not prevent him from entering by the same way, as the outward pointing corner of the diagram happened to be imperfectly drawn):
Also protective is the use in Icelandic folklore of a gestured or carved rather than painted pentagram (called in Icelandic), according to 19th century folklorist Jón Árnason:
:A butter that comes from the fake vomit is called a fake butter; it looks like any other butter; but if one makes a sign of a cross over it, or carves a cross on it, or a figure called a buttermilk-knot,* it all explodes into small pieces and becomes like a grain of dross, so that nothing remains of it, except only particles, or it subsides like foam. Therefore it seems more prudent, if a person is offered a horrible butter to eat, or as a fee, to make either mark on it, because a fake butter cannot withstand either a cross mark or a butter-knot.
:&amp;ast; The butter-knot is shaped like this: 

===Uses in modern occultism===
Based on Renaissance-era occultism, the pentagram found its way into the symbolism of modern occultists. Its major use is a continuation of the ancient Babylonian use of the pentagram as an apotropaic charm to protect against evil forces. Éliphas Lévi claimed that &quot;The Pentagram expresses the mind&#x27;s domination over the elements and it is by this sign that we bind the demons of the air, the spirits of fire, the spectres of water, and the ghosts of earth.&quot; In this spirit, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn developed the use of the pentagram in the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram, which is still used to this day by those who practice Golden Dawn-type magic.

Aleister Crowley made use of the pentagram in the system of magick used in Thelema: an adverse or inverted pentagram represents the descent of spirit into matter, according to the interpretation of Lon Milo DuQuette. Crowley contradicted his old comrades in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, who, following Levi, considered this orientation of the symbol evil and associated it with the triumph of matter over spirit.

===Use in new religious movements===

====Baháʼí Faith====
The five-pointed star is a symbol of the Baháʼí Faith. In the Baháʼí Faith, the star is known as the &quot;Haykal&quot; (), and it was initiated and established by the Báb. The Báb and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh wrote various works in the form of a pentagram.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is theorized to have begun using both upright and inverted five-pointed stars in Temple architecture, dating from the Nauvoo Illinois Temple dedicated on 30 April 1846. Other temples decorated with five-pointed stars in both orientations include the Salt Lake Temple and the Logan Utah Temple. These usages come from the symbolism found in Revelation chapter 12: &quot;And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.&quot;

====Wicca====

Because of a perceived association with Satanism and occultism, many United States schools in the late 1990s sought to prevent students from displaying the pentagram on clothing or jewelry. In public schools, such actions by administrators were determined in 2000 to be in violation of students&#x27; First Amendment right to free exercise of religion.

The encircled pentagram (referred to as a pentacle by the plaintiffs) was added to the list of 38 approved religious symbols to be placed on the tombstones of fallen service members at Arlington National Cemetery on 24 April 2007. The decision was made following ten applications from families of fallen soldiers who practiced Wicca. The government paid the families to settle their pending lawsuits.

===Other religious use===

==== Satanism ====
The inverted pentagram is broadly used in Satanism, sometimes depicted with the goat&#x27;s head of Baphomet, as popularized by the Church of Satan since 1968. LaVeyan Satanists pair the goat head with Hebrew letters at the five points of the pentagram to form the Sigil of Baphomet. The Baphomet sigil was adapted for the Joy of Satan Ministries logo, using cuneiform characters at the five points of the pentagram, reflecting the shape&#x27;s earliest use in Sumeria. The inverted pentagram also appears in The Satanic Temple logo, with an alternative depiction of Baphomet&#x27;s head. Other depictions of the Satanic goat&#x27;s head resemble the inverted pentagram without its explicit outline.

====Serer religion====
The five-pointed star is a symbol of the Serer religion and the Serer people of West Africa. Called &quot;Yoonir&quot; in their language, it symbolizes the universe in the Serer creation myth, and also represents the star Sirius.

===Other modern use===
*The pentagram is featured on the national flags of Morocco (adopted 1915) and Ethiopia (adopted 1996 and readopted 2009)
*The Order of the Eastern Star, an organization (established 1850) associated with Freemasonry, uses a pentagram as its symbol, with the five isosceles triangles of the points colored blue, yellow, white, green, and red. In most Grand Chapters the pentagram is used pointing down, but in a few, it is pointing up. Grand Chapter officers often have a pentagon inscribed around the star(the emblem shown here is from the Prince Hall Association).
*A pentagram is featured on the flag of the Dutch city of Haaksbergen, as well on its coat of arms.
*A pentagram is featured on the flag of the Japanese city of Nagasaki, as well on its emblem.
==Geometry==

The pentagram is the simplest regular star polygon. The pentagram contains ten points (the five points of the star, and the five vertices of the inner pentagon) and fifteen line segments. It is represented by the Schläfli symbol {5/2}. Like a regular pentagon, and a regular pentagon with a pentagram constructed inside it, the regular pentagram has as its symmetry group the dihedral group of order 10.

It can be seen as a net of a pentagonal pyramid although with isosceles triangles.

===Construction===
The pentagram can be constructed by connecting alternate vertices of a pentagon; see details of the construction. It can also be constructed as a stellation of a pentagon, by extending the edges of a pentagon until the lines intersect.

===Golden ratio===

The golden ratio, &quot;φ&quot; = (1 + ) / 2 ≈ 1.618, satisfying:
:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
plays an important role in regular pentagons and pentagrams. Each intersection of edges sections the edges in the golden ratio: the ratio of the length of the edge to the longer segment is &quot;φ&quot;, as is the length of the longer segment to the shorter. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram&#x27;s center) is &quot;φ&quot;. As the four-color illustration shows:
:formula_4

The pentagram includes ten isosceles triangles: five acute and five obtuse isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is &quot;φ&quot;. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangle highlighted via the colored lines in the illustration is a golden gnomon.

===Trigonometric values===

:formula_5

As a result, in an isosceles triangle with one or two angles of 36°, the longer of the two side lengths is &quot;φ&quot; times that of the shorter of the two, both in the case of the acute as in the case of the obtuse triangle.

===Spherical pentagram===

A pentagram can be drawn as a star polygon on a sphere, composed of five great circle arcs, whose all internal angles are right angles. This shape was described by John Napier in his 1614 book &quot;Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio&quot; (Description of the wonderful rule of logarithms) along with rules that link the values of trigonometric functions of five parts of a right spherical triangle (two angles and three sides). It was studied later by Carl Friedrich Gauss.

===Three-dimensional figures===

Several polyhedra incorporate pentagrams:
===Higher dimensions===
Orthogonal projections of higher dimensional polytopes can also create pentagrammic figures:
All ten 4-dimensional Schläfli–Hess 4-polytopes have either pentagrammic faces or vertex figure elements.

==Pentagram of Venus==

The pentagram of Venus is the apparent path of the planet Venus as observed from Earth. Successive inferior conjunctions of Venus repeat with an orbital resonance of approximately 13:8—that is, Venus orbits the Sun approximately 13 times for every eight orbits of Earth—shifting 144° at each inferior conjunction. The tips of the five loops at the center of the figure have the same geometric relationship to one another as the five vertices, or points, of a pentagram, and each group of five intersections equidistant from the figure&#x27;s center have the same geometric relationship.

==In computer systems==

The pentagram has these Unicode code points that enable them to be included in documents:

<doc id="197549" wikidata="Q989618" url="?curid=197549" title="Endless Summer (The Beach Boys album)">
<text>Endless Summer is a compilation album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on June 24, 1974. A collection of hits from the band&#x27;s 1962–65 period, &quot;Endless Summer&quot; was compiled by their old label, Capitol Records, following the success of the film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;, in which several songs were featured. It revitalized the band&#x27;s popularity after years of lukewarm sales, but also inspired nostalgia for the Beach Boys&#x27; early surfing and hot rod-themed music, repositioning the group as an oldies act.

Four months after its release, the album reached number 1 in the United States and Canada. It was the group&#x27;s second chart-topping album in the US and returned them to a level of commercial success they had not experienced since the mid-1960s. The compilation spent 155 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart and was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA for shipping over three million copies. Capitol released a second themed compilation in 1975 titled &quot;Spirit of America&quot;, which also sold well.

The album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981).
It was voted number 972 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Background==
In 1992, Mike Love noted, &quot;They were going to do a &quot;Best Of The Beach Boys Volume Three&quot; in 19- , whatever the hell it was, and I came in there and went, &quot;Wait a second, call it &quot;Endless Summer&quot;, instead of being &quot;Volume Three&quot; which sound nauseating to me. &quot;Endless Summer&quot; has a whole other vibe to it and sold several million copies just with the switch of the title. But then I&#x27;m a title guy anyway.&quot;

==Artwork==
Initial pressings of this album contained a poster depicting an airplane flying a Beach Boys banner. While the album is limited entirely to the band&#x27;s 1960s material, the cover artwork reflected the Beach Boys&#x27; 1970s appearance. The artwork illustrator was Keith McConnell (who also did the artwork for their follow-ups, &quot;Spirit of America&quot; and &quot;Sunshine Dream&quot;). With vegetation in the foreground, it also seems to evoke images of the band&#x27;s late 1960s &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; album, although none of the songs on the original pressing are from &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. (&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was added to the 1987 CD release of the album as a bonus track.)

==Releases==
Although originally released as a double album (two LPs in a gatefold sleeve) in the US, the album was released in the UK on a single LP with 10 songs on each side.

The records on the vinyl release were pressed with Sides 1 &amp; 4 on one disc and Sides 2 &amp; 3 on the other to accommodate record changers, which were widely popular in the 1970s. The cassette version differs slightly as to the sequence of tracks. Side 1 features all tracks from Sides 1 &amp; 2 in the same order plus &quot;I Get Around&quot; from Side 3. Side 2 includes the remaining tracks from Sides 3 &amp; 4 in the same order with the exception of &quot;Girls on the Beach&quot; and &quot;Wendy&quot; which were &#x27;swapped&#x27;.

The song &quot;Help Me, Ronda,&quot; the version from the album &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot;, which was the one included in this album, was retitled &quot;Help Me, Rhonda,&quot; like the hit single version. It was featured as one of two Beach Boys tracks in a promotional-only various artists compilation album issued by Capitol records entitled &quot;The Greatest Music Ever Sold&quot; (Capitol SPRO-8511/8512), that was distributed to record stores during the 1976 Holiday season as part of Capitol&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Music Ever Sold&quot; campaign, which promoted 15 &quot;Best Of&quot; albums released by the record label. The song was once again retitled &quot;Help Me, Rhonda,&quot; for this compilation album. &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; from &quot;Spirit of America&quot; was the other Beach Boys song to be included.

The audiophile reissue label DCC Compact Classics released its own &quot;Endless Summer&quot; CD in 1995. It was mastered by Steve Hoffman and contains the hit single versions of &quot;Help Me, Rhonda&quot; and &quot;Be True to Your School&quot; rather than the alternate album versions which appeared on the original release. It also retains the &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; bonus track from the 1987 Capitol CD.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Brian Wilson and Mike Love, except where noted.

<doc id="197551" wikidata="Q345658" url="?curid=197551" title="Vladislav Volkov">
<text>Vladislav Nikolayevich Volkov (; 23 November 193530 June 1971) was a Soviet cosmonaut who flew on the Soyuz 7 and Soyuz 11 missions. The second mission terminated fatally. Volkov and the two other crew members were asphyxiated on reentry, the only three people to have died in outer space.

==Biography==
Volkov graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute in 1959. As an aviation engineer at Korolyov Design Bureau, he was involved in the development of the Vostok and Voskhod spacecraft prior to his selection as a cosmonaut. He flew aboard Soyuz 7 in 1969.

Volkov, on his second space mission in 1971, was assigned to Soyuz 11 along with Georgy Dobrovolsky and Viktor Patsayev. The three cosmonauts on this flight spent 23 days on Salyut 1, the world&#x27;s first space station. After three relatively placid weeks in orbit, however, Soyuz 11 became the second Soviet space flight to terminate fatally, after Soyuz 1.

After a normal re-entry, the Soyuz 11 capsule was opened and the corpses of the three crew members were found inside. It was discovered that a valve had opened just before leaving orbit that had allowed the capsule&#x27;s atmosphere to vent away into space, causing Volkov and his two flight companions to suffer fatal hypoxia as their cabin descended toward the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

== Awards and remembrance ==

Vladislav Volkov was decorated twice as the Hero of the Soviet Union (first on 22 October 1969 and posthumously on 30 June 1971). He was also awarded the two Orders of Lenin and the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the USSR. His ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall on Red Square in Moscow.

The lunar crater &quot;Volkov&quot; and the minor planet 1790 Volkov are named in his honor. A street in Moscow is named after him.

The &quot;Yeniseyles&quot; Soviet research/survey ship was renamed &quot;Kosmonavt Vladislav Volkov&quot; in his honor in 1974.

A tomato variety from Ukraine was named Cosmonaut Volkov in his memory by his friend the space scientist and gardener Mikhailovich Maslov.

Volkov is an honorary citizen of Kaluga and Kirov.

1973 to 2015, the Pilotcosmonaut-Volkov-Award (later Volkov-Cup) was given for the best sports acrobatics since 2016 called Zolotov-Cup; while alive, Volkov became the first chairman of the Soviet Society of Sportsacrobatics in 1970.

In &quot;Russia in Space&quot;, Brian Harvey described a fleet of communication vessels or &quot;comships&quot;, used to track Soviet space missions. The fleet included a ship known as the &quot;Vladislav Volkov&quot;, built during the 1970s. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, several of the fleet&#x27;s ships were either sold to other governments, or left idle in harbor.

An account of Volkov&#x27;s life and space career appears in the 2003 book &quot;Fallen Astronauts: Heroes Who Died Reaching for the Moon&quot; by Colin Burgess.

=== In popular culture ===
In the 1999 film &quot;Virus&quot;, an alien intelligence infects the research vessel &quot;Akademic Vladislav Volkov&quot; &#x27;s computer system via a space transmission. The was redecorated for the film.

<text>Licensed to Ill is the debut studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys. It was released on November 15, 1986, by Def Jam and Columbia Records. The album became the first rap LP to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and was the second rap album to be certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is one of Columbia Records&#x27; fastest-selling debut records to date and was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2015 for shipping over ten million copies in the United States. The album received critical acclaim for its unique musical style, chemistry between the group members, and their stylized rapping. Since its release, &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; has been ranked by critics as one of the greatest hip hop and debut albums of all time.

Despite its popularity and success, this would be the group’s only album to be released from Def Jam due to creative differences with producer Rick Rubin, resulting in the group leaving the label to sign with Capitol Records for their next album, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot; (1989).

==Background==
The group originally wanted to title the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Be a Faggot&quot;, but Columbia Records refused to release the album under this title—arguing that it was homophobic—and pressured Russell Simmons, Beastie Boys&#x27; manager and head of Def Jam Recordings at the time, into forcing them to choose another name. Adam Horovitz has since apologized for the album&#x27;s earlier title.

Kerry King of Slayer made an appearance on the album playing lead guitar on &quot;Fight for Your Right&quot; and &quot;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&quot;, and also appeared in the music videos, of which the latter is a parody of glam metal. The name of the song itself is a spoof on Motörhead&#x27;s &quot;No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith&quot; album. King&#x27;s appearance on the track came about because Rick Rubin was producing both bands simultaneously (Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Reign in Blood&quot; was released one month prior on Def Jam).

CBS/Fox Video released a video album of the five &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; videos, plus &quot;She&#x27;s on It&quot; in 1987 to capitalize on the album&#x27;s success. A laserdisc version was also released in Japan. All versions of the CBS/Fox release are currently out of print because the rights to the album passed from Columbia and Sony Music to Universal Music Group, and also because of the acrimonious nature of the band&#x27;s departure from Def Jam Records. Until the 2005 release of the CD/DVD &quot;Solid Gold Hits&quot;, none of the Def Jam-era videos had been included on any subsequent Beastie Boys video compilations. The &quot;Solid Gold Hits&quot; DVD includes the videos for &quot;Fight for Your Right&quot; and &quot;No Sleep Till Brooklyn&quot;, as well as a live version of &quot;Brass Monkey&quot; from a 2004 concert.

Beastie Boys recorded a loose rendition of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; for the album, which included sampling of the original song, but the track was pulled at the last minute due to legal disputes with Michael Jackson who owned the publishing rights. Both &quot;I&#x27;m Down,&quot; and another track, &quot;Scenario,&quot; were cut at the last minute. Bootleg versions of the songs can be found on the internet.

==Artwork==
The full album cover, front to back, features an American Airlines Boeing 727 with a Beastie Boys logo on its tail, which has crashed head-on into the side of a mountain, the former taking the shape of an extinguished marijuana joint. The tail of the plane also features the Def Jam logo and the registration number &#x27;3MTA3&#x27; which spells &#x27;EATME&#x27; when viewed in a mirror. The idea for the album&#x27;s cover came from the album&#x27;s producer, Rick Rubin, after reading the Led Zeppelin biography &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot;. The artwork was created by Stephen Byram and World B. Omes.

The album cover was featured in Storm Thorgerson&#x27;s and Aubrey Powell&#x27;s book, &quot;100 Best Album Covers&quot;. Additionally, the design was strongly referenced by rapper Eminem for the cover of his 2018 album, &quot;Kamikaze&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; was met with critical acclaim. In 1998, the album was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s 100 Best Rap Albums. It is the only album by a Jewish hip-hop act to receive 5 mics from &quot;The Source&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked number 217 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, 219 in a 2012 revised list, and 192 in a 2020 revised list. In 2013 the magazine named it the 48th best debut album of all time. &quot;Vibe&quot; included it in &quot;Vibe&quot;&#x27;s 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. &quot;Q&quot; gave the album four out of five stars, saying &quot;&quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; remains the world&#x27;s only punk rock rap album, arguably superior to &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks&quot; ... knowing that apathy and slovenliness were just around the corner.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; gave the album a positive review, saying &quot;There&#x27;s lots of self-reverential bragging, more tenuous rhymes than are usually permitted by law and, most importantly of all, an unshakably glorious celebration of being alive ... A surprisingly enduring classic.&quot; In 2002, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the album at number 41 on its list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&quot;, despite their prior unflattering review of the album. In the 2018 edition of the &quot;Top 200 Albums of the 1980s&quot;, the album placed number 103.

In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed the album at number 16 in its list of &quot;40 Best Albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 12 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot; saying &quot;Rife with layer upon layer of sampling, start-stop transitions, and aggressive beats, it helped transform the genre from a direct dialogue between MC and DJ into a piercing, multi-threaded narrative&quot; and &quot;helped set an exciting template for the future&quot;. Eminem said the album was one of his favorites of all time and said it changed hip hop. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called &quot;She&#x27;s Crafty&quot; a &quot;slamming tongue-in-cheek rocker.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 2, 1987 and eventually was certified Diamond on March 4, 2015. The single &quot;Brass Monkey&quot; was certified Gold for shipment of 500,000+ sales. In 2012, in the week following Adam Yauch&#x27;s death, which subsequently resulted in a surge in sales of Beastie Boys albums, &quot;Licensed to Ill&quot; reached number 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Catalog Albums chart. The album also re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 18.

<doc id="197558" wikidata="Q187726" url="?curid=197558" title="Monsters, Inc.">
<text>Monsters, Inc. (also known as Monsters, Incorporated) is a 2001 American animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Featuring the voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, James Coburn, Mary Gibbs, and Jennifer Tilly, the film was directed by Pete Docter, co-directed by Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, and produced by Darla K. Anderson, from a screenplay by Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson. The film centers on two monsters, the hairy James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan (Goodman) and his one-eyed partner and best friend Mike Wazowski (Crystal), who are employed at the titular energy-producing factory Monsters, Inc., which generates power by scaring human children. However, the monster world believes that the children are toxic, and when a little human girl, Boo (Gibbs), sneaks into the factory, she must be returned home before it is too late.

Docter began developing the film in 1996, and wrote the story with Jill Culton, Jeff Pidgeon and Ralph Eggleston, following the idea conceived in a lunch in 1994 attended during the near completion of &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995). Stanton wrote the screenplay with Gerson. The characters went through many incarnations over the film&#x27;s five-year production process. The technical team and animators found new ways to simulate fur and cloth realistically for the film. Randy Newman, who composed the music for Pixar&#x27;s three prior films, returned to compose the score for its fourth.

&quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on October 28, 2001, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 2. Upon its release, it received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, grossing over $528 million worldwide to become the third-highest-grossing film of 2001. The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot; and was nominated for the first Best Animated Feature, but lost to DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;Shrek&quot;, and was also nominated for Best Original Score and Best Sound Editing. &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; saw a 3D re-release in theaters on December 19, 2012. A prequel titled &quot;Monsters University&quot;, which was directed by Dan Scanlon, was released on June 21, 2013. A sequel series titled &quot;Monsters at Work&quot; premiered on Disney+ on July 7, 2021.

==Plot==

In a world inhabited by monsters, the city of Monstropolis harnesses the screams of human children for energy. At the Monsters, Incorporated factory, skilled monsters employed as &quot;scarers&quot; venture into the human world to scare children and harvest their screams through doors that activate portals to children&#x27;s bedroom closets. The work is considered dangerous, as human children are believed to be toxic and capable of killing a monster through physical contact. Monsters, Inc. CEO, Henry J. Waternoose III, is concerned about the declining energy production, as children are becoming less easily scared.

One evening after work, top scarer James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan discovers that an active door has been left in the station of his rival, Randall Boggs. He inspects the door and accidentally lets a toddler girl into the factory. Frightened, Sulley unsuccessfully tries returning the girl, who escapes into Monstropolis, interrupting Sulley&#x27;s best friend and assistant Mike Wazowski on a date at a sushi restaurant. Chaos erupts when other monsters see the girl; Sulley and Mike escape with her as the Child Detection Agency (CDA) arrives and quarantines the restaurant. Forced to keep the girl hidden in their apartment for the night, Sulley realizes that she is not toxic and her laughter can generate more energy than screams.

The next day, Sulley and Mike disguise the girl as a monster and attempt to send her home. While Mike seeks out her door, Sulley grows attached to her and nicknames her &quot;Boo&quot;. Randall, waiting in ambush for the girl, kidnaps Mike by accident and reveals his plan to kidnap children and extract screams from them using his invention, the Scream Extractor. Sulley rescues Mike, and they search for Waternoose to alert him of Randall&#x27;s plan. However, Boo inadvertently reveals herself to Waternoose, who reveals that he is working with Randall. Waternoose banishes Mike and Sulley to the Himalayas in the human world, and abducts Boo.

Sulley finds a way to return to the monster world, but Mike refuses to go with him. Sulley returns to the factory and rescues Boo from the Scream Extractor, but Randall fights him. Mike returns to reconcile with Sulley, and both search for Boo&#x27;s door. Randall eventually catches up to the trio, and Boo easily defeats him after a chase through the factory door vault. Sulley and Mike banish Randall through a door to the human world and destroy it.

Mike and Sulley locate Boo&#x27;s door, but Waternoose brings it down to the scare floor, intending to have the CDA arrest Mike and Sulley. Mike distracts the CDA while Sulley and Boo lure Waternoose into a scare simulation room. There, Sulley tricks Waternoose into revealing his conspiracy with Randall to kidnap thousands of children. Mike records the conversation, exposing Waternoose to the CDA, who arrest him. Undercover CDA agent Roz allows Sulley to send Boo home, but has her door destroyed. Sulley retools the company&#x27;s power generation method to harvest children&#x27;s laughter instead of screams, as laughter is ten times more powerful. With the energy crisis solved, the factory is now focused on making children laugh to collect energy; Mike becomes the company&#x27;s top comedian and Sulley becomes the new CEO. Mike then reveals to Sulley he has rebuilt Boo&#x27;s door. Sulley enters the door and reunites with Boo.

== Voice cast ==

* John Goodman as James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan, a huge, intimidating but well-meaning scarer at Monsters, Inc. At the film&#x27;s beginning, he has been the &quot;Best Scarer&quot; at Monsters, Inc. for several months running.
* Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski, a short, one-eyed scarer assistant who is Sulley&#x27;s best friend, roommate, and coworker. He is charming and generally the more organized of the two, but he is prone to neurotics, and his ego sometimes leads him astray.
* Mary Gibbs as Boo, a three-year-old human girl who is unafraid of any monster except Randall, the scarer assigned to her door. She believes Sulley is a large cat and refers to him as &quot;Kitty&quot;. The book based on the film gives Boo&#x27;s &quot;real&quot; name as Mary Gibbs, the name of her voice actress, who is also the daughter of one of the film&#x27;s story artists, Rob.
* Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, a snide and preening monster with a chameleon-like ability to change his skin color and blend in completely with his surroundings, who makes himself a rival to Sulley and Mike in the scream collection.
* James Coburn as Henry J. Waternoose, the CEO of Monsters, Inc., a job passed down through his family for three generations, who is secretly in league with Randall.
* Jennifer Tilly as Celia Mae, a receptionist for Monsters, Inc. and Mike&#x27;s girlfriend.
* Bob Peterson as Roz, the administrator for Scare Floor F, where Sulley, Mike, and Randall work. She is secretly the head of the CDA, operating undercover inside Monsters, Inc.
* John Ratzenberger as Yeti a.k.a. The Abominable Snowman, a former Monsters, Inc. employee who was banished to the Himalayas. His appearance is based on that of the Abominable Snowman in the 1964 Rankin/Bass animated special &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.
* Frank Oz as Fungus, Randall&#x27;s beleaguered assistant.
* Daniel Gerson as Needleman and Smitty, two small janitor monsters who idolize Sulley and operate the Door Shredder when required.
* Steve Susskind as Jerry, a good friend of Waternoose who manages Scare Floor F.
* Bonnie Hunt as Flint, a talent recruiter who trains new monsters to scare children.
* Jeff Pidgeon as Bile, an accident-prone trainee scarer for Monsters, Inc.
* Sam Black as George Sanderson, a scarer at Monsters, Inc. In a running gag throughout the film, he repeatedly makes contact with objects from the human world, resulting in CDA agents tackling him, shaving his entire body, and sterilizing him. He is good friends with coworker Pete &quot;Claws&quot; Ward.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, along with ideas that would eventually become &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, and &quot;WALL-E&quot;, was conceived in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, and Joe Ranft near the completion of &quot;Toy Story&quot;. One of the ideas that came out of the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. &quot;When we were making &quot;Toy Story&quot;&quot;, Docter said, &quot;everybody came up to me and said, &#x27;Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.&#x27; So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s do a film about monsters.

Docter began work on the film that was to become &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; in 1996 while others focused on &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998) and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999). Its code name was &quot;Hidden City&quot;, after Docter&#x27;s favorite restaurant in Point Richmond. By early February 1997, Docter, together with Harley Jessup, Jill Culton, and Jeff Pidgeon, had drafted a treatment that bore some resemblance to the final film. Docter pitched the story to Disney with some initial artwork on February 4 that year. He and his story team left with some suggestions in hand and returned to pitch a refined version of the story on May 30. At this pitch meeting, longtime Disney animator Joe Grant – whose work stretched back to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) – suggested the title &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, a play on the title of a gangster film &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot;, and the name stuck. The film would be the first Pixar feature not directed by Lasseter, helmed instead by Docter, as well as Lee Unkrich and David Silverman, who served as co-directors. The early test of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was released on October 11, 1998.

===Writing===
The storyline took on many forms during production. Docter&#x27;s original idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he drew in a book as a child coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears eventually caused the monsters to disappear.

After Docter scrapped the initial concept of a 30-year-old terrified of monsters, he decided on a buddy story between a monster and a child titled simply &quot;Monsters&quot;, in which the monster character of Sulley (known at this stage as Johnson) was an up-and-comer at his workplace, where the company&#x27;s purpose was to scare children. Sulley&#x27;s eventual sidekick, Mike Wazowski, had not yet been added.

Between 1996 and 2000, the lead monster and child went through radical changes as the story evolved. As the story continued to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl would be the best counterpart for a furry, co-star. After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African American character. Originally, the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers. In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing. He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company&#x27;s top performer. Through various drafts, Johnson&#x27;s occupation went back and forth between scarer and some other position such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc. Throughout development, Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team &quot;bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters&quot; while still attempting to solve the problem. A key moment came when the team decided, &quot;Okay, he&#x27;s the BEST scarer there. He&#x27;s the star quarterback&quot;, with Docter noting that before that moment &quot;design after design, we really didn&#x27;t know what he was about.&quot; Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to &quot;look like a guy in a suit&quot;. To this end, Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles. Mary&#x27;s age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of three. &quot;We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley&quot;, Docter said.

Eventually, Johnson was renamed Sullivan. Sullivan was also planned to wear glasses throughout the film. However, the creators found it a dangerous idea because the eyes were a perfectly readable and clear way of expressing a character&#x27;s personality; thus, this idea was also rejected.

The idea of a monster buddy for the lead monster emerged at an April 6, 1998, &quot;story summit&quot; in Burbank with employees from Disney and Pixar. A term coined by Lasseter, a &quot;story summit&quot; was a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in only two days. Such a character, the group agreed, would give the lead monster someone to talk to about his predicament. Development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of a rounded, one-eyed monster as a concept for the character, and everyone was generally receptive to it. Docter named the character Mike for the father of his friend Frank Oz, a director and Muppet performer. Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike helps Sulley choose a tie for work, and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the film. Originally, Mike had no arms and had to use his legs as appendages; however, due to some technical difficulties, arms were soon added to him.

Screenwriter Daniel Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 and worked daily on the film with the filmmakers for almost two years. He considered it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, &quot;I would sit with Pete [Docter] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We&#x27;d get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here&#x27;s where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further.&quot;

Docter has cited the 1973 film &quot;Paper Moon&quot; as inspiration for the concept of someone experiencing getting stuck with a kid who turns out to be the real expert, and he credits Lasseter for coming up with the &quot;laughter is ten times more powerful than fear&quot; concept.

===Casting===
Bill Murray was considered for the voice role of James P. &quot;Sulley&quot; Sullivan. He screen-tested for the role and was interested, but when Pete Docter was unable to make contact with him, he took it as a &quot;no&quot;. The voice role of Sulley went to John Goodman, the longtime co-star of the comedy series &quot;Roseanne&quot; and a regular in the films of the Coen brothers. Goodman interpreted the character to himself as the monster equivalent of a National Football League player. &quot;He&#x27;s like a seasoned lineman in the tenth year of his career,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;He is totally dedicated and a total pro.&quot; Billy Crystal, regretting having turned down the part of Buzz Lightyear years prior, accepted that of Mike Wazowski, Sulley&#x27;s one-eyed best friend and scare assistant.

===Animation===

In November 2000, early in the production of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, Pixar packed up and moved for the second time after its Lucasfilm Ltd. years. The company&#x27;s 500 employees had become spread among three buildings, separated by a busy highway. The company moved from Point Richmond to a much bigger campus in Emeryville, co-designed by Lasseter and Steve Jobs.

In production, the film differed from earlier Pixar features, as every main character in this movie had its own lead animator – John Kahrs on Sulley, Andrew Gordon on Mike, and Dave DeVan on Boo. Kahrs found that the &quot;bearlike quality&quot; of Goodman&#x27;s voice provided an exceptionally good fit with the character. He faced a difficult challenge, however, in dealing with Sulley&#x27;s sheer mass; traditionally, animators conveyed a figure&#x27;s heaviness by giving it a slower, more belabored movement, but Kahrs was concerned that such an approach to a central character would give the film a &quot;sluggish&quot; feel. Like Goodman, Kahrs came to think of Sulley as a football player, one whose athleticism enabled him to move quickly in spite of his size. To help the animators with Sulley and other large monsters, Pixar arranged for Rodger Kram, a University of California, Berkeley expert on the locomotion of heavy mammals, to lecture on the subject.

Adding to Sulley&#x27;s lifelike appearance was an intense effort by the technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm &amp; Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals&#x27; faces in the 1995 film &quot;Babe&quot;. This film, however, required fur on a much larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar&#x27;s engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was to figure out how to animate a large number of hairs – 2,320,413 of them on Sulley – in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in &quot;Toy Story&quot;, the hair on Andy&#x27;s toddler sister, as seen in that movie&#x27;s opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).

The first fur test allowed Sulley to run an obstacle course. Results were not satisfactory, as such objects caught and stretched out the fur due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur went &quot;through&quot; the objects.

Pixar then set up a Simulation department and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt (short for &quot;physics tool&quot;). After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated, this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley&#x27;s fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way. Every time when Sulley had to move, his fur (automatically) reacted to his movements, thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well. The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo&#x27;s clothes, which provided another &quot;breakthrough&quot;. The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge because of the hundreds of creases and wrinkles that occur in clothing when the wearer moves. The team also had to solve the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled – in other words, to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect. Fizt applied the same system to Boo&#x27;s clothes as to Sulley&#x27;s fur. First of all, Boo was animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo&#x27;s body, and every time she moved, her clothes also reacted to her movements in a more natural manner.
To solve the problem of cloth-to-cloth collisions, Michael Kass, Pixar&#x27;s senior scientist, was joined on &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; by David Baraff and Andrew Witkin and developed an algorithm they called &quot;global intersection analysis&quot; to handle the problem. The complexity of the shots in the film, including elaborate sets such as the door vault, required more computing power to render than any of Pixar&#x27;s earlier efforts combined. The render farm in place for &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was made up of 3500 Sun Microsystems processors, compared with 1400 for &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; and only 200 for &quot;Toy Story&quot;, both built on Sun&#x27;s own RISC-based SPARC processor architecture.

The scene in which the Harryhausen&#x27;s restaurant was decontaminated was originally going to feature the restaurant being blown up. Due to the September 11 attacks, the explosion was replaced by a plasma dome.

==Music==

&quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; was Randy Newman&#x27;s fourth feature film collaboration with Pixar. The end credits song &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot; was sung by John Goodman and Billy Crystal.

The album was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. The score lost both these awards to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, but after sixteen nominations, the song &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot; finally won Newman his first Academy Award for Best Original Song. During his acceptance speech, he jokingly said &quot;I don&#x27;t want your pity&quot;. It also won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

==Release==
===Marketing===
In October 2000, a teaser trailer of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was unveiled, which could not only be found online, but was also attached to the home video releases of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. This trailer would be attached to &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot; theatrically and can later be seen on the DVD release of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;, which was released on May 1, 2001. Another &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; trailer premiered in theaters in June 2001 with the release of &quot;&quot;.

Several Happy Meal toys based on the film were released by McDonald&#x27;s. Meanwhile, Hasbro debuted their own &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; toys at the North American International Toy Fair event.

===Theatrical===
The film premiered on October 28, 2001, at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California. It was theatrically released on November 2, 2001 in the United States, in Australia on December 26, 2001, and in the United Kingdom on February 8, 2002. The theatrical release was accompanied by the Pixar short animated film &quot;For the Birds&quot;.

As with &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, a montage of &quot;outtakes&quot; and a performance of a play based on a line from the film were made and included in the end credits of the film starting on December 7, 2001.

After the success of the 3D re-release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Disney and Pixar re-released &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; in 3D on December 19, 2012.

===Home media===
&quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on September 17, 2002. Both releases are THX certified and feature the animated shorts &quot;Mike&#x27;s New Car&quot; and &quot;For the Birds&quot;. The DVD release presents the film in widescreen and fullscreen, both taken from the digital source by Pixar. The widescreen version additionally includes filmmakers&#x27; commentary and a sound effects-only audio track. On the second disc, there are a variety of bonus features including animated shorts, outtakes, the &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot; music video, and more. This release set records for the highest single-day DVD sales with 5 million copies being sold on its first day. Although this record was surpassed by &quot;Spider-Man&quot; two months later, the film continued to hold the highest single-day record for an animated movie until 2003 when &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; took it. The film was then released on Blu-ray on November 10, 2009, and on Blu-ray 3D on February 19, 2013. While the 2009 Blu-ray release featured a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound track, the 2013 reissue and its 3D counterpart feature a 7.1 channel Dolby TrueHD track. &quot; Monsters, Inc.&quot; was released on 4K Blu-ray on March 3, 2020.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On its first day of release, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; earned $17.8 million, then generated $26.9 million the following day, making the latter the second-highest Saturday gross of all time, behind &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. It ranked number one at the box office upon opening, beating out &quot;K-PAX&quot;, &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Domestic Disturbance&quot;, and &quot;The One&quot;. The film&#x27;s debut also led to audience declines of &quot;From Hell&quot;, &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot;, &quot;Training Day&quot;, &quot;Bandits&quot;, and other films. &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; held the record for having the biggest opening weekend of an animated film, making $62,577,067 and surpassing the previous record held by &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. It would last for two years until the release of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; in May 2003. The film was ranked as the biggest three-day opening weekend for a Disney film, dethroning &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. It was even the fourth film of the year to reach $60 million within its first three days of release, just after &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, and &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. The film had a small drop-off of 27.2% over its second weekend, earning another $45,551,028, while also outgrossing &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; and &quot;Heist&quot; to remain at the top spot. In its third weekend, the film experienced a larger decline of 50.1%, placing itself in the second position just after &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. In its fourth weekend, however, there was an increase of 5.9%, making $24,055,001 that weekend for a combined $528 million. As of May 2013, it is the eighth-biggest fourth weekend ever for a film.

The film made $289,916,256 in North America, and $287,509,478 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $577,425,734. The film is Pixar&#x27;s ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide and sixth-highest in North America. For a time, the film surpassed &quot;Aladdin&quot; as the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time, only behind 1994&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta, it earned £37,264,502 ($53,335,579), marking the sixth-highest-grossing animated film of all time in the country and the 32nd-highest-grossing film of all time. In Japan, although earning $4,471,902 during its opening and ranking second behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; for the weekend, it moved to first place on subsequent weekends due to exceptionally small decreases or even increases and dominated for six weeks at the box office. It finally reached $74,437,612, standing as 2001&#x27;s third-highest-grossing film and the third-largest U.S. animated feature of all time in the country behind &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 96% based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Clever, funny, and delightful to look at, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; delivers another resounding example of how Pixar elevated the bar for modern all-ages animation.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade, becoming the second Pixar film to gain the score after &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;.

Charles Taylor of &quot;Salon&quot; magazine stated, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s agreeable and often funny, and adults who take their kids to see it might be surprised to find themselves having a pretty good time.&quot; Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a positive review, praising the film&#x27;s usage of &quot;creative energy&quot;, saying &quot;There hasn&#x27;t been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;&quot; Although Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; thought the comedy was sometimes &quot;more frenetic than inspired and viewer emotions are rarely touched to any notable degree&quot;, he also viewed the film as &quot;visually inventive as its Pixar predecessors&quot;.

&quot;ReelViews&quot; film critic James Berardinelli gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote that the film was &quot;one of those rare family films that parents can enjoy (rather than endure) along with their kids&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;cheerful, high-energy fun, and like the other Pixar movies, has a running supply of gags and references aimed at grownups&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B+&quot; grade and praised its animation, stating &quot;Everything from Pixar Animation Studios – the snazzy, cutting-edge computer animation outfit – looks really, really terrific and unspools with a liberated, heppest-moms-and-dads-on-the-block iconoclasm.&quot;

===Accolades===

&quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Original Song (Randy Newman, after fifteen previous nominations, for &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Have You&quot;). It was one of the first animated films to be nominated for Best Animated Feature (lost to &quot;Shrek&quot;). It was also nominated for Best Original Score (lost to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;) and Best Sound Editing (lost to &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;). At the Kid&#x27;s Choice Awards in 2002, it was nominated for &quot;Favorite Voice in an Animated Movie&quot; for Billy Crystal (who lost to Eddie Murphy in &quot;Shrek&quot;).

==Lawsuits==

Shortly before the film&#x27;s release, Pixar was sued by children&#x27;s songwriter Lori Madrid of Wyoming, stating that the company had stolen her ideas from her 1997 poem &quot;There&#x27;s a Boy in My Closet&quot;.

Madrid mailed her poem to six publishers in October 1999, notably Chronicle Books, before turning it into a local stage musical in August 2001. After seeing the trailer for &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, Madrid concluded that Chronicle Books had passed her work to Pixar and that the film was based on her work. In October 2001, she filed the suit against Chronicle Books, Pixar, and Disney in a federal court in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her lawyer asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.

In a hearing on November 1, 2001, the day before the film&#x27;s scheduled release, the judge refused to issue the injunction. On June 26, 2002, he ruled that the film had nothing in common with the poem.

In November 2002, Stanley Mouse filed a lawsuit in which he alleged that the characters of Mike and Sulley were based on drawings of &quot;Excuse My Dust&quot;, a film that he had tried to sell to Hollywood in 1998. The lawsuit also stated that a story artist from Pixar visited Mouse in 2000 and discussed Mouse&#x27;s work with him. A Disney spokeswoman responded, saying that the characters in &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; were &quot;developed independently by the Pixar and Walt Disney Pictures creative teams, and do not infringe on anyone&#x27;s copyrights&quot;. The case was ultimately settled under undisclosed terms.

==Prequel==

A prequel, titled &quot;Monsters University&quot;, was released on June 21, 2013. John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi reprised their roles of Sulley, Mike, and Randall, while Dan Scanlon directed the film. The prequel&#x27;s plot focuses on Sulley and Mike&#x27;s studies at Monsters University, where they start off as rivals but soon become best friends.

==Other media==
An animated short, &quot;Mike&#x27;s New Car&quot;, was made by Pixar in 2002 in which the two main characters have assorted misadventures with a car Mike has just bought. This film was not screened in theaters, but is included with all home video releases of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and on Pixar&#x27;s Dedicated Shorts DVD. In August 2002, a manga version of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; was made by Hiromi Yamafuji and distributed in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Comic Bon Bon&quot; magazine in Japan; the manga was published in English by Tokyopop until it went out of print. A series of video games, including a multi-platform video game were created based on the film. The video games included &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc. Scream Team&quot; and &quot;Monsters, Inc. Scream Arena&quot;. A game titled &quot;Monsters, Inc. Run&quot; was released on the App Store for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad on December 13, 2012.

Feld Entertainment toured a &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; edition of their &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s World on Ice&quot; skating tour from 2003 to 2007. &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; has inspired three attractions at Disney theme parks around the world. In 2006 Monsters, Inc. Mike &amp; Sulley to the Rescue! opened at Disneyland Resort&#x27;s Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, California. In 2007, Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor opened at Walt Disney World Resort&#x27;s Magic Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, replacing The Timekeeper. The show is improvisational in nature, and features the opportunity for Guests to interact with the monster comedians and submit jokes of their own via text message. In 2009 Monsters, Inc. Ride &amp; Go Seek opened at Tokyo Disney Resort&#x27;s Tokyo Disneyland in Chiba, Japan.

In 2009, Boom! Studios produced a &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; comic book mini-series that ran for four issues. The storyline takes place after the movie and focuses on Sulley and Mike&#x27;s daily struggles to operate Monsters Inc. on its new laughter-focused company policy. At the same time, their work is impeded by the revenge schemes of Randall and Waternoose, as well as a human child (indirectly revealed to be Sid Phillips from the &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise) who has hijacked the company&#x27;s closet door technology to commit a string of toy thefts throughout the human world.

Sulley, Mike, Boo, Randall, Celia and Roz appear as playable characters in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;, being unlocked during the progress of the game&#x27;s main storyline.

A world based on the film made its debut appearance in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, making it the second Disney-Pixar movie featured in the series after &quot;Toy Story&quot;. The world takes place after the events of the first film.

===Television series===

In November 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke about plans to develop a television series spin-off of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; among other properties owned by the company. By November of the following year the series was confirmed for Disney+, and would continue the story of the previous films. On April 9, 2019, it was announced that Goodman, Crystal, and Tilly would return as Mike, Sulley, and Celia, respectively for the series. Peterson returns as Roz and also voices her twin sister Roze. Additional cast members include Ben Feldman as Tylor Tuskmon, Mindy Kaling as Val, Henry Winkler as Fritz, Lucas Neff as Duncan, Alanna Ubach as Cutter, Stephen Stanton as Needleman and Smitty (replacing Gerson), and Aisha Tyler as Tylor&#x27;s mother Millie. In addition, Ratzenberger returns as Yeti and also voices Tylor&#x27;s father Bernard. It was released on Disney+ on July 7, 2021. The series begins the day after Waternoose&#x27;s arrest and follows Tylor who hopes to be promoted to the Laugh Floor.
