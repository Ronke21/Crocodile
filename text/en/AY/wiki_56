<text>Mystery is a fiction genre where the nature of an event, usually a murder or other crime, remains until the end of the story. Often within a closed circle of suspects, each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime. The central character is often a detective (such as Sherlock Holmes), who eventually solves the mystery by logical deduction from facts presented to the reader. Some mystery books are non-fiction. Mystery fiction can be detective stories in which the emphasis is on the puzzle or suspense element and its logical solution such as a whodunit. Mystery fiction can be contrasted with hardboiled detective stories, which focus on action and gritty realism.

Mystery fiction can involve a supernatural mystery in which the solution does not have to be logical and even in which there is no crime involved. This usage was common in the pulp magazines of the 1930s and 1940s, whose titles such as &quot;Dime Mystery&quot;, &quot;Thrilling Mystery&quot;, and &quot;Spicy Mystery&quot; offered what were then described as complicated to solve and weird stories: supernatural horror in the vein of &quot;Grand Guignol&quot;. That contrasted with parallel titles of the same names which contained conventional hardboiled crime fiction. The first use of &quot;mystery&quot; in that sense was by &quot;Dime Mystery&quot;, which started out as an ordinary crime fiction magazine but switched to &quot;weird menace&quot; during the later part of 1933.

==Beginnings==

The genre of mystery novels is a young form of literature that has developed since the early 19th century. The rise of literacy began in the years of the English Renaissance and, as people began to read over time, they became more individualistic in their thinking. As people became more individualistic in their thinking, they developed a respect for human reason and the ability to solve problems.

Perhaps a reason that mystery fiction was unheard of before the 19th century was due in part to the lack of true police forces. Before the Industrial Revolution, many towns would have constables and a night watchman at best. Naturally, the constable would be aware of every individual in the town, and crimes were either solved quickly or left unsolved entirely. As people began to crowd into cities, police forces became institutionalized, and the need for detectives was realized – thus the mystery novel arose.

An early work of modern mystery fiction, &quot;Das Fräulein von Scuderi&quot; by E. T. A. Hoffmann (1819), was an influence on &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe (1841) as may have been Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zadig&quot; (1747). Wilkie Collins&#x27; novel &quot;The Woman in White&quot; was published in 1860, while &quot;The Moonstone&quot; (1868) is often thought to be his masterpiece. In 1887 Arthur Conan Doyle introduced Sherlock Holmes, whose mysteries are said to have been singularly responsible for the huge popularity in this genre. In 1901 Maurice Leblanc created gentleman burglar, Arsène Lupin, whose creative imagination rivaled the &quot;deduction&quot; of Sherlock Holmes, who was disparagingly included in some Lupin stories under obvious pseudonyms.

The genre began to expand near the turn of the century with the development of dime novels and pulp magazines. Books were especially helpful to the genre, with many authors writing in the genre in the 1920s. An important contribution to mystery fiction in the 1920s was the development of the juvenile mystery by Edward Stratemeyer. Stratemeyer originally developed and wrote the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries written under the Franklin W. Dixon and Carolyn Keene pseudonyms respectively (and were later written by his daughter, Harriet Adams, and other authors). The 1920s also gave rise to one of the most popular mystery authors of all time, Agatha Christie, whose works include &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1934), &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1937), and the world&#x27;s best-selling mystery &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; (1939).

The massive popularity of pulp magazines in the 1930s and 1940s increased interest in mystery fiction. Pulp magazines decreased in popularity in the 1950s with the rise of television, so much that the numerous titles available then are reduced to two today: &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; and &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;—both now published by Dell Magazines, a division of Crosstown Publications. The detective fiction author Ellery Queen (pseudonym of Frederic Dannay and Manfred B. Lee) is also credited with continuing interest in mystery fiction.

===21st century===
Interest in mystery fiction continues to this day partly because of various television shows which have used mystery themes and the many juvenile and adult novels which continue to be published. There is some overlap with &quot;thriller&quot; or &quot;suspense&quot; novels and authors in those genres may consider themselves mystery novelists. Comic books and graphic novels have carried on the tradition, and film adaptations or the even-more-recent web-based detective series, have helped to re-popularize the genre in recent times.

==Classifications==
===Detective fiction===
Though the origins of the genre date back to ancient literature and One Thousand and One Nights, the modern detective story as it is known today was invented by Edgar Allan Poe in the mid-19th century through his short story, &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, which featured arguably the world&#x27;s first fictional detective, C. Auguste Dupin. However, detective fiction was popularized only later, in the late 19th century, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories, considered milestones in crime fiction.

The detective story shares some similarities with mystery fiction in that it also has a mystery to be solved, , red herrings, some plot twists along the way and a detective denouement, but differs on several points. Most of the Sherlock Holmes stories feature no suspects at all, while mystery fiction, in contrast, features a large number of them. As noted, detective stories feature professional and retired detectives, while mystery fiction almost exclusively features amateur detectives. Finally, detective stories focus on the detective and how the crime was solved, while mystery fiction concentrates on the identity of the culprit and how the crime was committed, a distinction that separated &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; from other works of Agatha Christie.

A common subgenre of detective fiction is the Whodunit. Whodunits experienced an increase in popularity during the Golden Age of Detective Fiction of the 1920s-1940s, when it was the primary style of detective fiction. This subgenre is classified as a detective story where the reader is given clues throughout as to who the culprit is, giving the reader the opportunity to solve the crime before it is revealed. During the Golden Age, whodunits were written primarily by women, however Wilkie Collins&#x27; &quot;The Moonstone&quot; is often recognized as one of the first examples of the genre.

===True crime===

True crime is a literary genre that recounts real crimes committed by real people, almost half focusing on serial killers. Criticized by many as being insensitive to those personally acquainted with the incidents, it is often categorized as trash culture. Having basis on reality, it shares more similarities with docufiction than the mystery genre. Unlike fiction of the kind, it does not focus much on the identity of the culprit and has no red herrings or clues, but often emphasizes how the culprit was caught and their motivations behind their actions.

===Cozy mystery===
Cozy mysteries began in the late 20th century as a reinvention of the Golden Age whodunit; these novels generally shy away from violence and suspense and frequently feature female amateur detectives. Modern cozy mysteries are frequently, though not necessarily in either case, humorous and thematic. This genre features minimal violence, sex and social relevance, a solution achieved by intellect or intuition rather than police procedure, with order restored in the end, honorable characters, and a setting in a closed community. The murders are often committed by less violent tools such as poison and the wounds inflicted are rarely if ever used as clues. The writers who innovated and popularized the genre include Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers and Elizabeth Daly.

===Legal thriller===

The legal thriller or courtroom novel is also related to detective fiction. The system of justice itself is always a major part of these works, at times almost functioning as one of the characters. In this way, the legal system provides the framework for the legal thriller as much as the system of modern police work does for the police procedural. The legal thriller usually starts its business with the court proceedings following the closure of an investigation, often resulting in a new angle on the investigation, so as to bring about a final outcome different from the one originally devised by the investigators. In the legal thriller, court proceedings play a very active, if not to say decisive part in a case reaching its ultimate solution. Erle Stanley Gardner popularized the courtroom novel in the 20th century with his Perry Mason series. Contemporary authors of legal thrillers include Michael Connelly, Linda Fairstein, John Grisham, John Lescroart, Paul Levine, Lisa Scottoline and Scott Turow.

===Police procedural===
Many detective stories have police officers as the main characters. These stories may take a variety of forms, but many authors try to realistically depict the routine activities of a group of police officers who are frequently working on more than one case simultaneously, providing a stark contrast to the detective-as-superhero archetype of Sherlock Holmes. Some of these stories are whodunits; in others, the criminal is known, and the police must gather enough evidence to charge them with the crime.

In the 1940s the police procedural evolved as a new style of detective fiction. Unlike the heroes of Christie, Chandler, and Spillane, the police detective was subject to error and was constrained by rules and regulations. As Gary Huasladen says in his book &quot;Places for Dead Bodies&quot;, &quot;not all the clients were insatiable bombshells, and invariably there was life outside the job.&quot; The detective in the police procedural does the things police officers do to catch a criminal. Writers of the genre include Ed McBain, P. D. James and Bartholomew Gill.

===Howcatchem===

An inverted detective story, also known as a &quot;howcatchem&quot;, is a plot structure of murder mystery fiction in which the commission of the crime is shown or described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator. The story then describes the detective&#x27;s attempt to solve the mystery. There may also be subsidiary puzzles, such as why the crime was committed, and they are explained or resolved during the story. This format is the inversion of the more typical &quot;whodunit&quot;, where all of the details of the perpetrator of the crime are not revealed until the story&#x27;s climax.

===Hardboiled fiction===

Martin Hewitt, created by British author Arthur Morrison in 1894, is one of the first examples of the modern style of fictional private detective. This character is described as an &quot;&#x27;Everyman&#x27; detective meant to challenge the detective-as-superman that Holmes represented.&quot;

By the late 1920s, Al Capone and the Mob were inspiring not only fear, but piquing mainstream curiosity about the American crime underworld. Popular pulp fiction magazines like Black Mask capitalized on this, as authors such as Carrol John Daly published violent stories that focused on the mayhem and injustice surrounding the criminals, not the circumstances behind the crime. Very often, no actual mystery even existed: the books simply revolved around justice being served to those who deserved harsh treatment, which was described in explicit detail.&quot; The overall theme these writers portrayed reflected &quot;the changing face of America itself.&quot;

In the 1930s, the private eye genre was adopted wholeheartedly by American writers. One of the primary contributors to this style was Dashiell Hammett with his famous private investigator character, Sam Spade. His style of crime fiction came to be known as &quot;hardboiled&quot;, which is described as a genre that &quot;usually deals with criminal activity in a modern urban environment, a world of disconnected signs and anonymous strangers.&quot; &quot;Told in stark and sometimes elegant language through the unemotional eyes of new hero-detectives, these stories were an American phenomenon.&quot; According to the best-selling author Michael Connelly,&quot;Chandler credited Hammett with taking the mystery out of the drawing-room and putting it out on the street where it belongs.&quot;

In the late 1930s, Raymond Chandler updated the form with his private detective Philip Marlowe, who brought a more intimate voice to the detective than the more distanced &quot;operative&#x27;s report&quot; style of Hammett&#x27;s Continental Op stories. Despite struggling through the task of plotting a story, his cadenced dialogue and cryptic narrations were musical, evoking the dark alleys and tough thugs, rich women and powerful men about whom he wrote. Several feature and television movies have been made about the Philip Marlowe character. James Hadley Chase wrote a few novels with private eyes as the main heroes, including &quot;Blonde&#x27;s Requiem&quot; (1945), &quot;Lay Her Among the Lilies&quot; (1950), and &quot;Figure It Out for Yourself&quot; (1950). The heroes of these novels are typical private eyes, very similar to or plagiarizing Raymond Chandler&#x27;s work.

Ross Macdonald, pseudonym of Kenneth Millar, updated the form again with his detective Lew Archer. Archer, like Hammett&#x27;s fictional heroes, was a camera eye, with hardly any known past. &quot;Turn Archer sideways, and he disappears,&quot; one reviewer wrote. Two of Macdonald&#x27;s strengths were his use of psychology and his beautiful prose, which was full of imagery. Like other &#x27;hardboiled&#x27; writers, Macdonald aimed to give an impression of realism in his work through violence, sex and confrontation. The 1966 movie Harper starring Paul Newman was based on the first Lew Archer story The Moving Target (1949). Newman reprised the role in The Drowning Pool in 1976.

Michael Collins, pseudonym of Dennis Lynds, is generally considered the author who led the form into the Modern Age. His private investigator, Dan Fortune, was consistently involved in the same sort of David-and-Goliath stories that Hammett, Chandler, and Macdonald wrote, but Collins took a sociological bent, exploring the meaning of his characters&#x27; places in society and the impact society had on people. Full of commentary and clipped prose, his books were more intimate than those of his predecessors, dramatizing that crime can happen in one&#x27;s own living room.

The PI novel was a male-dominated field in which female authors seldom found publication until Marcia Muller, Sara Paretsky and Sue Grafton were finally published in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Each author&#x27;s detective, also female, was brainy and physical and could hold her own. Their acceptance, and success, caused publishers to seek out other female authors.

===Historical mystery===

These works are set in a time period considered historical from the author&#x27;s perspective, and the central plot involves the solving of a mystery or crime (usually murder). Though works combining these genres have existed since at least the early 20th century, many credit Ellis Peters&#x27;s The Cadfael Chronicles (1977–1994) for popularizing what would become known as the historical mystery.

===Locked-room mystery===

The locked-room mystery is a subgenre of detective fiction. The crime—almost always murder—is committed in circumstances under which it was seemingly impossible for the perpetrator to commit the crime and/or evade detection in the course of getting in and out of the crime scene. The genre was established in the 19th century. Poe&#x27;s The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841) is considered the first locked-room mystery; since then, other authors have used the scheme. John Dickson Carr was recognized as a master of the genre and his &quot;The Hollow Man&quot; was recognized by a panel of 17 mystery authors and reviewers as the best locked-room mystery of all time in 1981. The crime in question typically involves a crime scene with no indication as to how the intruder could have entered or left, i.e., a locked room. Following other conventions of classic detective fiction, the reader is normally presented with the puzzle and all of the clues, and is encouraged to solve the mystery before the solution is revealed in a dramatic climax.

<text>The national drug code (NDC) is a unique product identifier used in the United States for drugs intended for human use. The Drug Listing Act of 1972 requires registered drug establishments to provide the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a current list of all drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed by it for commercial distribution. Drug products are identified and reported using the NDC.

There are several alternative drug classification systems in addition to NDC that are also commonly used when analyzing drug data, such as Generic Product Identifier (GPI).

==Format==
The national drug code is a unique 10 or 11 digit, 3-segment numeric identifier assigned to each medication listed under Section 510 of the US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The segments identify the labeler or vendor, product (within the scope of the labeler), and trade package (of this product).

*The first segment, the labeler code, is 4, 5 or 6 digits long and assigned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) upon submission of a Labeler Code Request. A labeler is any firm that manufactures, repacks or distributes a drug product.
*The second segment, the product code, is 3 or 4 digits long and identifies a specific strength, dosage form, and formulation for a particular firm.
*The third segment, the package code, is 1 or 2 digits long and identifies package forms and sizes. In very exceptional cases, product and package segments may have contained characters other than digits.

While the labeler code is assigned by the FDA, both the product and package segments are assigned by the labeler. While in the past labelers may have had the opportunity to reassign old product codes no longer used to new products, according to the new FDA validation procedures, once an NDC code is assigned to one product (defined by key properties including active ingredients, strength, and dosage form) it may not be later reassigned to a different product.

NDC codes exist in one of the following groupings of digits into segments: 4-4-2, 5-3-2, 5-4-1, 6-3-2, or 6-4-1.

The following NDC structure rules apply depending on the length of certain segments. These rules include the 11 digit format. Unless stated otherwise, search for drug codes using the 10 digit format.

* If a labeler code is either 5 or 6 digits in length, it may be combined with:
** A product code consisting of 4 digits and a package code consisting of 1 digit for a total NDC length of 10 or 11 digits (5-4-1 or 6-4-1), or
** A product code consisting of 3 digits and a package code consisting of 2 digits for a total NDC length of 10 or 11 digits (5-3-2 or 6-3-2).
* If a labeler code is 4 digits in length, it may be combined only with a product code consisting of 4 digits and a package code consisting of 2 digits for a total NDC length of 10 digits (4-4-2).
* A registrant or private label distributor with a given labeler code must use only one Product-Package Code configuration (e.g., a 3-digit product code combined with a 2-digit package code or a 4-digit product code combined with a 1-digit package code).

The official FDA format for NDCs separates the 3 segments with dashes. This is the format in which the NDC must be submitted by labelers since mandatory electronic listing was established in June 2009.

While the NDC is a 10-digit identifier, confusion exists because of a proliferation of different notations and variants.

The previous NDC directory, populated by a paper-based listing system, sometimes inserted an asterisk in either a product code or a package code in addition to the dashes. This format is easily transformed to the official format in effect today by deleting the asterisk (if any).

Each NDC-coded product package in the US bears a barcode with a Universal Product Code that begins with a 3 (UPC-A) or 03 (EAN-13). The remainder of the numbers can be the 10 NDC digits, plus the check digit, but this is not required. If the NDC is used in the UPC it is the most minimal form of the NDC code with 10 digits only. Because the NDC code has been linked with product barcodes in this way, the NDC code could contain ambiguities in this form. For example, 1234-5678-90, 12345-678-90, and 12345-6789-0 could all be entirely different products with the same barcode 1234567890. To prevent any actual ambiguity from impacting the marketplace, ambiguity checks are part of the new electronic listing process.

The pure 10-digit NDC format cannot be transformed back into the standard format with dashes without the help of the product listing database.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) had created an 11-digit NDC derivative, which pads the labeler, product, or package code segments of the NDC with leading zeroes wherever they are needed to result in a fixed length 5-4-2 configuration (but always written without dashes). This format was adopted by data standards selected pursuant to HIPAA regulation, thus other government agencies&#x27; lists and databases (such as the UMLS) may contain the 11-digit derivative of the original NDC.

The 11-digit NDC format cannot be transformed back into the 10-digit standard format without the help of a product listing database.

In some applications, the fully expanded 5+4 digit labeler+product code is used as a 9-digit number to identify a product regardless of packaging. Thus an 11-digit NDC can be transformed into a 9-digit NDC product code by removing the last two digits. This does not work reliably for 10-digit NDCs where the packaging code might be one digit and not two.

In 2022, the FDA proposed revising the NDC regulations to require use of a uniform 12-digit NDC with the same three functional segments but with uniform segment lengths of 6, 4, and 2 digits.

<text>Young Marble Giants were a Welsh post-punk band formed in Cardiff, Wales, in 1978. Their music was based around the vocals of Alison Statton along with the minimalist instrumentation of brothers Philip and Stuart Moxham. Their early sound was a sharp contrast with the more aggressive punk rock that dominated the underground at the time. Young Marble Giants released just one studio album, &quot;Colossal Youth&quot;, in 1980. They also released two EPs and recorded a John Peel session.

==History==
Members of Young Marble Giants had previously been in a band called True Wheel. Stuart Moxham&#x27;s girlfriend, Wendy Smith, lent him the money to buy his Rickenbacker. (Smith, an art student in Cardiff at the time Young Marble Giants formed, photographed the band&#x27;s US tour, and also designed cover art for several singles and albums by Weekend.)

Very early in their existence, there was a fourth member of the band, Peter Joyce, who was a cousin of the Moxham brothers. Joyce was a telephone engineer and skilled at electronics, and had made his own synthesiser from a kit. It made sounds similar to Eno&#x27;s synths in the early Roxy Music, and Kraftwerk, both of which employed similar &#x27;low-tech/high-tech&#x27; electronics. Young Marble Giants used tape recordings of Joyce&#x27;s home-made drum machine, since they did not wish to have a drummer at that time. They were also interested in effects devices such as ring modulators and reverb units, with the emphasis always on simplicity.

Their first vinyl release was on the compilation LP &quot;Is the War Over?&quot; on Cardiff DIY label, Z Block Records, in October 1979. While signed to UK independent record label, Rough Trade Records the YMGs released two EPs, &quot;Final Day&quot; and &quot;Testcard&quot;, and an album, &quot;Colossal Youth&quot; (a reference to the Early Greek &#x27;Kouroi&#x27; marble statues, from which the YMGs took the inspiration for their name.) The artwork of the album was inspired by the Beatles album, &quot;With the Beatles&quot;.

The band toured Europe and North America and played in Berlin, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and New York. Touring companions included the band Cabaret Voltaire. In September 1980, they played the gothic rock Futurama Festival in Leeds.

==Post-breakup projects== 
After the band split up in 1981, Stuart Moxham formed the Gist, whose song &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; became a hit in continental Europe, when covered by French pop singer Étienne Daho, under the title &quot;Paris, Le Flore&quot;. Following a very severe motorbike accident Stuart concentrated on home recording, which resulted in the album &quot;Embrace the Herd&quot; (1982) again on Rough Trade, and his first CD album &quot;Signal Path&quot; (1992) on the Chicago-based Feel Good All Over label, before fans persuaded him to enter the studio again. The result was the album &quot;Random Rules&quot; (1993) and featured Spike (guitar and viola), younger brother Andrew (drums) and London-based French songwriter Louis Philippe (keyboard and arrangements). A band was formed to perform Stuart&#x27;s new material, which gigged, albeit briefly, in France and the UK. Another album, &quot;Cars in the Grass&quot;, followed. Stuart had also been recording in the US (the album &quot;Fine Tuning&quot; and six tracks on the album &quot;Barbara Manning Sings with the Original Artists&quot; (1993)), where he has acquired a small fanbase. Now based in the West Country, Moxham is still writing songs. A new album, &quot;The Huddle House&quot;, recorded as a duet with Philippe, with whom he has regularly performed, was released on Wonder Records in May 2007.

Alison Statton, Spike and Simon Emmerson (later of Working Week and Afro Celt Sound System) formed Weekend (with Phil Moxham on bass) and several jazz musicians including Larry Stabbins, Harry Beckett and Keith Tippett.

In 1989 and 1990, Alison Statton worked with Ian Devine, the former guitarist of the post-punk group Ludus. They released two records together, &quot;The Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Cardiffians&quot;. Blaine L. Reininger of Tuxedomoon was a featured performer on &quot;The Prince of Wales&quot;.

Later, Philip Moxham played bass for the Communards and Everything but the Girl. He featured on the latter&#x27;s second UK album, &quot;Love Not Money&quot;, and toured with EBTG in 1985 to promote it. He also worked with David Thomas and the Pedestrians.

==Reformation==
In early 2003, Statton and the Moxham brothers reunited for a BBC Radio Wales special. They performed one new song, &quot;Alright&quot;.

A reunion show was held in Hay-on-Wye on 27 May 2007, part of the Hay-on-Wye Festival, with Stuart Moxham&#x27;s website explaining: &quot;Young Marble Giants reform for a one-off celebration of Domino Records&#x27; re-release of their album &quot;Colossal Youth&quot;, combined in a triple CD package with the Lo-Fi, private reference recordings of the &quot;Salad Days&quot; album and the otherwise unobtainable Peel Sessions.&quot;
Hay-on-Wye was not a one-off. Convinced by the booking agency, the band also played a show for the BB-Mix Festival in Boulogne-Billancourt, just outside Paris, on 28 October 2007. Instead of the drum machine they had originally used, younger Moxham brother Andrew joined the group playing an electronic-drumkit.

The band continued to perform over this period, including appearances at the Primavera Sound Festival on 31 May 2008, and at the Hebbel am Ufer Theatre in Berlin on 16 January 2009. The Young Marble Giants played the entirety of &quot;Colossal Youth&quot; at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties in Minehead, Somerset, on 9 May 2009 – they were chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel for a return performance at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in March 2012, again in Minehead.

The band played gigs at the Dancehouse Theatre in Manchester on 19 October 2014 and Stereo in Glasgow on 20 October.

They also performed at the MIMI Festival, on the Frioul Island in Marseille, on 3 July 2015.

On 8 June 2016, Stuart Moxham wrote on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that the band was no more. Young Marble Giants&#x27; last show was in London in August 2015.

==Style and influences==
Young Marble Giants&#x27; sound was characterised by Phil&#x27;s prominent bass lines, Stuart&#x27;s rhythm guitar (a Rickenbacker 425) and Galanti electric organ lines and Statton&#x27;s vocals. 

Musical influences included Eno, Kraftwerk, Neil Young, Lou Reed, the Velvet Underground, Roxy Music, David Bowie, Can and others. Stuart Moxham was a fan of Manchester guitarist Vini Reilly&#x27;s early work, and was also very interested in dub reggae. The band were acquainted with Scritti Politti, the band of Cardiff native Green Gartside, and signed to the same label, Rough Trade Records.

==Legacy==
Young Marble Giants have had a lasting influence on many other groups and artists. It was revealed in his &quot;Journals&quot; that they were, along with the Vaselines, one of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s two favourite bands. Courtney Love&#x27;s band Hole covered the Young Marble Giants track &quot;Credit in the Straight World&quot;; a cover version of their song &quot;The Man Amplifier&quot; was included on the Magnetic Fields single &quot;Why I Cry&quot; as a B-side; Sydney group Toys Went Berserk covered the song &quot;Brand-New-Life&quot; in 1990. &quot;Final Day&quot; was covered by both Belle and Sebastian and Galaxie 500. The original recording of the song was included in &quot;The Pitchfork 500&quot;.

<text>Aluminium hydroxide, , is found in nature as the mineral gibbsite (also known as hydrargillite) and its three much rarer polymorphs: bayerite, doyleite, and nordstrandite. Aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric, i.e., it has both basic and acidic properties. Closely related are aluminium oxide hydroxide, AlO(OH), and aluminium oxide or alumina (), the latter of which is also amphoteric. These compounds together are the major components of the aluminium ore bauxite. Aluminium hydroxide also forms a gelatinous precipitate in water.

==Structure==
 is built up of double layers of hydroxyl groups with aluminium ions occupying two-thirds of the octahedral holes between the two layers. Four polymorphs are recognized. All feature layers of octahedral aluminium hydroxide units, with hydrogen bonds between the layers. The polymorphs differ in terms of the stacking of the layers. All forms of crystals are hexagonal :
* gibbsite is also known as γ- or α- 
* bayerite is also known as α- or &quot;β-alumina trihydrate&quot;
* nordstrandite is also known as 
* doyleite

&quot;Hydrargillite&quot;, once thought to be aluminium hydroxide, is an aluminium phosphate. Nonetheless, both &quot;gibbsite&quot; and &quot;hydrargillite&quot; refer to the same polymorphism of aluminium hydroxide, with &quot;gibbsite&quot; used most commonly in the United States and &quot;hydrargillite&quot; used more often in Europe. Hydrargillite is named after the Greek words for water (&#x27;) and clay (&#x27;).

==Properties==
Aluminium hydroxide is amphoteric. In acid, it acts as a Brønsted–Lowry base. It neutralizes the acid, yielding a salt:

In bases, it acts as a Lewis acid by binding hydroxide ions:

==Production==

Virtually all the aluminium hydroxide used commercially is manufactured by the Bayer process which involves dissolving bauxite in sodium hydroxide at temperatures up to . The waste solid, bauxite tailings, is removed and aluminium hydroxide is precipitated from the remaining solution of sodium aluminate. This aluminium hydroxide can be converted to aluminium oxide or alumina by calcination.

The residue or bauxite tailings, which is mostly iron oxide, is highly caustic due to residual sodium hydroxide. It was historically stored in lagoons; this led to the Ajka alumina plant accident in 2010 in Hungary, where a dam bursting led to the drowning of nine people. An additional 122 sought treatment for chemical burns. The mud contaminated of land and reached the Danube. While the mud was considered non-toxic due to low levels of heavy metals, the associated slurry had a pH of 13.

==Uses==
===Filler and fire retardant===
Aluminium hydroxide finds use as a fire retardant filler for polymer applications. It is selected for these applications because it is colorless (like most polymers), inexpensive, and has good fire retardant properties. Magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of huntite and hydromagnesite are used similarly. These mixtures start to decompose at temperatures around to (depending on the type of aluminium hydroxide used), absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour. The decomposition rate of aluminium hydroxide increases with an increase in temperature, with an reported maximum rate at .

In addition to behaving as a fire retardant, it is very effective as a smoke suppressant in a wide range of polymers, most especially in polyesters, acrylics, ethylene vinyl acetate, epoxies, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and rubber.

Aluminium hydroxide is used as filler in some artificial stone compound material, often in acrylic resin.

===Precursor to Al compounds===
Aluminium hydroxide is a feedstock for the manufacture of other aluminium compounds: calcined aluminas, aluminium sulfate, polyaluminium chloride, aluminium chloride, zeolites, sodium aluminate, activated alumina, and aluminium nitrate.

Freshly precipitated aluminium hydroxide forms gels, which are the basis for the application of aluminium salts as flocculants in water purification. This gel crystallizes with time. Aluminium hydroxide gels can be dehydrated (e.g. using water-miscible non-aqueous solvents like ethanol) to form an amorphous aluminium hydroxide powder, which is readily soluble in acids. Heating converts it to activated aluminas, which are used as desiccants, adsorbent in gas purification, and catalyst supports.

===Pharmaceutical===
Under the generic name &quot;algeldrate&quot;, aluminium hydroxide is used as an antacid in humans and animals (mainly cats and dogs). It is preferred over other alternatives such as sodium bicarbonate because , being insoluble, does not increase the pH of stomach above 7, and hence does not trigger secretion of excess acid by the stomach. Brand names include Alu-Cap, Aludrox, Gaviscon or Pepsamar. It reacts with excess acid in the stomach, reducing the acidity of the stomach content, which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers, heartburn or dyspepsia. Such products can cause constipation, because the aluminium ions inhibit the contractions of smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract, slowing peristalsis and lengthening the time needed for stool to pass through the colon. Some such products are formulated to minimize such effects through the inclusion of equal concentrations of magnesium hydroxide or magnesium carbonate, which have counterbalancing laxative effects.

This compound is also used to control hyperphosphatemia (elevated phosphate, or phosphorus, levels in the blood) in people and animals suffering from kidney failure. Normally, the kidneys filter excess phosphate out from the blood, but kidney failure can cause phosphate to accumulate. The aluminium salt, when ingested, binds to phosphate in the intestines and reduce the amount of phosphorus that can be absorbed.

Precipitated aluminium hydroxide is included as an adjuvant in some vaccines (e.g. anthrax vaccine). One of the well-known brands of aluminium hydroxide adjuvant is Alhydrogel, made by Brenntag Biosector. Since it absorbs protein well, it also functions to stabilize vaccines by preventing the proteins in the vaccine from precipitating or sticking to the walls of the container during storage. Aluminium hydroxide is sometimes called &quot;alum&quot;, a term generally reserved for one of several sulfates.

Vaccine formulations containing aluminium hydroxide stimulate the immune system by inducing the release of uric acid, an immunological danger signal. This strongly attracts certain types of monocytes which differentiate into dendritic cells. The dendritic cells pick up the antigen, carry it to lymph nodes, and stimulate T cells and B cells. It appears to contribute to induction of a good Th2 response, so is useful for immunizing against pathogens that are blocked by antibodies. However, it has little capacity to stimulate cellular (Th1) immune responses, important for protection against many pathogens, nor is it useful when the antigen is peptide-based.

==Safety==
In the 1960s and 1970s it was speculated that aluminium was related to various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Since then, multiple epidemiological studies have found no connection between exposure to environmental or swallowed aluminium and neurological disorders, though injected aluminium was not looked at in these studies.

Neural disorders were found in experiments on mice motivated by Gulf War illness (GWI). Aluminium hydroxide injected in doses equivalent to those administered to the United States military, showed increased reactive astrocytes, increased apoptosis of motor neurons and microglial proliferation within the spinal cord and cortex.

<doc id="193298" wikidata="Q408516" url="?curid=193298" title="Gibbsite">
<text>Gibbsite, Al(OH)3, is one of the mineral forms of aluminium hydroxide. It is often designated as γ-Al(OH)3 (but sometimes as α-Al(OH)3). It is also sometimes called hydrargillite (or hydrargyllite).

Gibbsite is an important ore of aluminium in that it is one of three main phases that make up the rock bauxite.

Gibbsite has three named structural polymorphs or polytypes: bayerite (designated often as α-Al(OH)3, but sometimes as β-Al(OH)3), &quot;doyleite&quot;, and nordstrandite. Gibbsite can be monoclinic or triclinic, while bayerite is monoclinic. Doyleite and nordstrandite are triclinic forms.

==Structure==
The structure of gibbsite is interesting and analogous to the basic structure of the micas. The basic structure forms stacked sheets of linked octahedra. Each octahedron is composed of an aluminium ion bonded to six hydroxide groups, and each hydroxide group is shared by two aluminium octahedra. One third of the potential octahedral spaces are missing a central aluminium. The result is a neutral sheet: with aluminium as a +3 ion and hydroxide a −1 ion, the net cationic charge of one aluminium per six hydroxides is (+3)/6 = +1/2, and likewise the net anionic charge of one hydroxide per two aluminium atoms is (−1)/2 = −1/2. The lack of a charge on the gibbsite sheets means that there is no charge to retain ions between the sheets and act as a &quot;glue&quot; to keep the sheets together. The sheets are only held together by weak residual bonds and this results in a very soft easily cleaved mineral.

Gibbsite&#x27;s structure is closely related to the structure of brucite, Mg(OH)2. However the lower charge in brucite&#x27;s magnesium (+2) as opposed to gibbsite&#x27;s aluminium (+3) does not require that one third of the octahedrons be vacant of a central ion in order to maintain a neutral sheet. The different symmetry of gibbsite and brucite is due to the different way that the layers are stacked.

It is the gibbsite layer that in a way forms the &quot;floor plan&quot; for the mineral corundum, Al2O3. The basic structure of corundum is identical to gibbsite except the hydroxides are replaced by oxygen. Since oxygen has a charge of −2 the layers are not neutral and require that they must be bonded to other aluminiums above and below the initial layer producing the framework structure that is the structure of corundum.

Gibbsite is interesting for another reason because it is often found as a part of the structure of other minerals. The neutral aluminium hydroxide sheets are found sandwiched between silicate sheets in important clay groups: the illite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite/smectite groups. The individual aluminium hydroxide layers are identical to the individual layers of gibbsite and are referred to as the &quot;gibbsite layers&quot;.

The lattice parameters for gibbsite depending upon the particular method used to measure or calculate them and are therefore displayed as ranges below. An Al-Al interlayer spacing of 0.484 or 0.494 nm has been reported.
== Mineralogical properties ==
==Etymology==
Gibbsite is named after George Gibbs (1776–1833), an American mineral collector.

<text>A mixing console or mixing desk is an electronic device for mixing audio signals, used in sound recording and reproduction and sound reinforcement systems. Inputs to the console include microphones, signals from electric or electronic instruments, or recorded sounds. Mixers may control analog or digital signals. The modified signals are summed to produce the combined output signals, which can then be broadcast, amplified through a sound reinforcement system or recorded.

Mixing consoles are used for applications including recording studios, public address systems, sound reinforcement systems, nightclubs, broadcasting, and post-production. A typical, simple application combines signals from microphones on stage into an amplifier that drives one set of loudspeakers for the audience. A DJ mixer may have only two channels, for mixing two record players. A coffeehouse&#x27;s small stage might only have a six-channel mixer, enough for two singer-guitarists and a percussionist. A nightclub stage&#x27;s mixer for rock music shows may have 24 channels for mixing the signals from a rhythm section, lead guitar and several vocalists. A mixing console in a professional recording studio may have as many as 96 channels. Consoles used for live sound can go even higher, with some having up to 384 input channels.

In practice, mixers do more than simply mix signals. They can provide phantom power for condenser microphones; pan control, which changes a sound&#x27;s apparent position in the stereo field; filtering and equalization, which enables sound engineers to boost or cut selected frequencies to improve the sound; dynamic range compression, which allows engineers to increase the overall gain of the system or channel without exceeding the dynamic limits of the system; routing facilities, to send the signal from the mixer to another device, such as a sound recording system or a control room; and monitoring facilities, whereby one of a number of sources can be routed to loudspeakers or headphones for listening, often without affecting the mixer&#x27;s main output. Some mixers have onboard electronic effects, such as reverb. Some mixers intended for small venue live performance applications may include an integrated power amplifier.

==Terminology==
A mixing console is also known as an audio mixer, audio console, mixing desk, sound mixer, soundboard, or simply as a board or mixer.

==Structure==

An analog mixing board is divided into functional sections. Some of the more important functional sections are subdivided into subsections.

===Channel input strip===
The channel input strips are usually a bank of identical monaural or stereo input channels arranged in columns. Typically, each channel&#x27;s column contains a number of rotary potentiometer knobs, buttons, and faders for controlling the gain of the input preamplifier, adjusting the equalization of the signal on each channel, controlling routing of the input signal to other functional sections, and adjusting the channel&#x27;s contribution to the overall mix being produced.

The types of inputs that can be plugged into a mixer depend on the intended purpose of the mixer. A mixer intended for a live venue or a recording studio typically has a range of input jacks, such as XLR connectors for microphones and the outputs from DI boxes, and 1/4&quot; jacks for line level sources. A DJ mixer typically has RCA connector inputs for pre-recorded music being played back on turntables or CD players, and a single mic input.

Depending on the mixer, a channel may have buttons that enable the audio engineer to reroute the signal to a different output for monitoring purposes, turn on an attenuator pad (often reducing the signal by 15 or 20 dB to prevent audio clipping), or activate other features, such as a high-pass filter. Some higher-priced mixers have a parametric equalizer or a semi-parametric equalizer for one or more of the equalizer frequency bands, often the middle range.

The channel strips are typically numbered so that the audio engineer can identify the different channels. For each channel input, a mixer provides one or more input jacks. On mid- to large-sized live venues and sound recording consoles, these input jacks are numbered as well and consolidated in a patch bay. On smaller mixers, the input jacks may be mounted on the top panel of the mixer to facilitate the connection and disconnection of inputs during the use of the mixer.

The input strip is usually separated into sections:
* Input jacks
* Microphone preamplifiers
* Equalization
* Dynamics processing (e.g. dynamic range compression, gating), if supported
* Routing, including direct outs, auxiliary-sends, panning control, and subgroup assignments
* Level-control faders (on small mixers, these may be rotary knobs to save space and cost)

On many consoles, these sections are color-coded for quick identification by the operator. Each signal (e.g., a singer&#x27;s vocal mic, the signal from an electric bass amp&#x27;s DI box, etc.) that is plugged into the mixer has its own &quot;channel&quot;. Depending on the specific mixer, each channel is stereo or monaural. On most mixers, each channel has an XLR input, and many have RCA or quarter-inch TRS phone connector line inputs. The smallest, least expensive mixers may only have one XLR input with the other inputs being line inputs. These can be used by a singer-guitarist or other small acts.

====Basic input controls====
The first knob at the top of an input strip is typically a &quot;trim&quot; or &quot;gain&quot; control. The input/preamp conditions the signal from the external device and this controls the amount of amplification or attenuation that is applied to the input signal to bring it to a nominal level for processing. Due to the high gains involved (around +50 dB, for a microphone), this stage is where most noise and interference is picked up. Balanced inputs and connectors, such as XLR or phone connectors that have been specifically wired as balanced lines, reduce interference problems.

A microphone plugged directly into a power amplifier would not produce an adequate signal level to drive loudspeakers, because the microphone&#x27;s signal is too weak; the microphone signal needs a preamplifier to strengthen the signal so that it is strong enough for the power amplifier. For some very strong line level signals, the signal that is plugged into the mixer may be too strong, and cause audio clipping. For signals that are too strong, a 15 dB or 20 dB pad can be used to attenuate the signal. Both preamplifiers and pads, and the controls associated with them, are available in the input section of most mixing consoles.

Audio engineers typically aim at achieving a good &quot;gain structure&quot; for each channel. To obtain a good gain structure, engineers usually raise the gain as high as they can before audio clipping results; this helps to provide the best signal-to-noise ratio.

A mixing console may provide insert points after the input gain stage. These provide send and return connections for external processors that only affect an individual channel&#x27;s signal. Effects that operate on multiple channels connect to auxiliary sends (below).

====Auxiliary send routing====
The &quot;auxiliary send&quot; routes a split of the incoming signal to an auxiliary bus, which can then be routed to external devices. &quot;Auxiliary sends&quot; can either be pre-fader or post-fader, in that the level of a pre-fader send is set by the &quot;auxiliary send&quot; control, whereas post-fade sends depend on the position of the channel fader as well. &quot;Auxiliary sends&quot; can send the signal to an external processor such as a reverb, with the return signal routed through another channel or designated auxiliary return. Post-fader sends are normally used in this case. Pre-fade &quot;auxiliary sends&quot; can provide a monitor mix to musicians on stage (which they hear through monitor speakers pointing at the performers or in-ear monitors); this mix is thus independent of the main mix produced by the faders.
Most live radio broadcasting soundboards send audio through &quot;program&quot; channels. Most boards have 3-4 program channels, though some have more options. When a given channel button is selected, the audio will be sent to that device or transmitter. Program 1 is typically the on-air live feed, or what those listening to the broadcast will hear. Other program channels may feed one or more computers used for editing or sound playback. Another program channel may be used to send audio to the talent&#x27;s headset if they are broadcasting from a remote area.

===Channel equalization===
Further channel controls affect the equalization of the signal by separately attenuating or boosting a range of frequencies. The smallest, least expensive mixers may only have bass and treble controls. Most mid-range and higher-priced mixers have bass, midrange, and treble, or even additional mid-range controls (e.g., low-mid and high-mid). Many high-end mixing consoles have parametric equalization on each channel. Some mixers have a general equalization control (either graphic or parametric) at the output, for controlling the tone of the overall mix.

====Cue system====
The cue system allows the operator to listen to one or more selected signals without affecting the console&#x27;s main outputs. A sound engineer can use the cue feature to, for instance, get a sound recording they wish to play soon cued up to the start point of a song, without the listeners hearing these actions. The signal from the cue system is fed to the console&#x27;s headphone amp and may also be available as a line-level output that is intended to drive a monitor speaker system. The terms AFL (after-fader listen) and PFL (pre-fader listen) are used to describe respectively whether or not the level of the cue signal for an input is controlled by the corresponding fader. Consoles with a cue feature have a dedicated button on each channel, typically labeled &quot;Cue&quot;, &quot;AFL&quot;, &quot;PFL&quot;, &quot;Solo&quot;, or &quot;Listen&quot;. When cue is enabled on multiple channels, a mix of these signals is heard through the cue system.

Solo in place (SIP) is a related feature on advanced consoles. It typically is controlled by the cue button, but unlike cue, SIP affects the output mix; It mutes everything except the channel or channels being soloed. SIP is useful for setup of a mixing board and troubleshooting, in that it allows the operator to quickly mute everything but the signal being adjusted. For example, if an audio engineer is having problems with clipping on an input, they may use SIP to solely hear that channel, so that the problem can be diagnosed and addressed. SIP is potentially disastrous if engaged accidentally during a performance, as it will mute all the channels except one, so most consoles require the operator to take very deliberate actions to engage SIP.

====Busses and submix====
Each channel on a mixer has a volume control (&quot;fader&quot;) that allows adjustment of the level of that channel. These are usually sliders near the front of the mixing board, although some smaller mixers use rotary controls to save space. The signals are summed to create the main &quot;mix&quot;, or combined on a &quot;bus&quot; as a submix, a group of channels that are then added as a whole to the final mix. For instance, many drum mics could be grouped into a bus, and then the proportion of drums in the final mix can be controlled with one bus fader. A bus can often be processed just like an individual input channel, allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once. Once again using the drum kit example, the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks, rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually. There may also be insert points for a certain bus or even the entire mix.

====VCA groups====
Some higher-end consoles use voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) VCAs function somewhat like a submix but let the operator control the level of multiple input channels with a single fader. Unlike subgroups, no sub-mix is created. The audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently of VCA assignments. Since no sub-mix is created, it is not possible to insert processing such as compressors into a VCA group. In addition, on most VCA-equipped consoles, post-fader auxiliary send levels are affected by the VCA master. This is usually desirable, as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb, and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level. When implemented on a digital console the same functionality may be referred to as a DCA or control group (CG), depending on the brand of mixer.

For example, if an engineer wishes to control microphones for three background vocalists at one time, muting them or changing their volume relative to a lead singer, he might create a VCA rather than adjusting all three volumes separately. A sub-mix would be useful if he wanted to process all the singers together, adding the same amount of reverb or compression to each; but the VCA allows each channel to retain its distinctive processing while giving the engineer the ability to quickly adjust the group&#x27;s volume or mute them.

===Master output controls===
The master control section is used to adjust the levels of the overall output of the mixer. The master control section on a large live venue or sound recording mixer typically has sub-group faders, master faders, master auxiliary mixing bus level controls and auxiliary return level controls. On most mixers, the master control is a fader. However, on some small mixers, rotary knobs are used instead to save space (and cost).

In a typical live sound mixing context, with a band playing at a venue, consisting of a rhythm section, solo instrumentalists and singers, the master control section allows the audio engineer to control the volume of the entire group with just one fader (for monaural mixers) or a pair of left and right faders (for stereo mixers). 

Subgroup and main output fader controls are often found together on the right-hand side of the mixer or, on larger consoles, in a center section flanked by banks of input channels. Matrix routing is often contained in this master section, as are headphone and local loudspeaker monitoring controls. Talkback controls allow conversation with the artist through their monitors, headphones or in-ear monitor. A test tone generator might be located in the master output section. Aux returns such as those signals returning from external processors are often in the master section.

===Metering===

There are usually one or more VU or peak meters to indicate the levels for each channel, for the master outputs and to indicate whether the console levels are clipping the signal. The sound engineer typically adjusts the gain of the input signals to get the strongest signal that can be obtained without causing clipping. Having the gain set as high as possible improves the signal-to-noise ratio. Most mixers have at least one additional output besides the main mix. These are either individual bus outputs or &quot;auxiliary outputs&quot;, used, for instance, to output a different mix to onstage monitors.

The meters may be above the input and master sections or they may be integrated into the input and master sections themselves. Meters may have needles or LEDs. On meters using LEDs, there may be different colored LEDs to indicate when there is signal present in the channel&#x27;s input; the audio level of the channel, typically by lighting up more LEDs; and clipping, which may be indicated using a different colored LED. In one popular color-coding system, green LEDs indicate signal presence and the audio level; one or more amber LEDs indicate that the channel is approaching clipping; and one or more red LEDs indicate clipping.

As the human ear experiences audio level in a logarithmic fashion, mixing console controls and displays are almost always labeled in decibels, a logarithmic measurement system. Since the decibel represents a relative measurement, and not a unit itself, the meters must be referenced to a nominal level. Most professional audio equipment is referenced to a nominal level of +4 dBu, while semi-professional and domestic equipment is usually referenced to a nominal level of −10 dBV.

===Hardware routing and patching===
For convenience, some mixing consoles include inserts or a patch bay or patch panel. Patch bays are more common in recording mixers than live sound mixers. In live sound, the cables from the onstage microphones and instrument outputs are not typically plugged directly into the mixer, because this would require a large number of individual cables to go from the stage to the mixer. Instead, the onstage mic and instrument cables are typically plugged into the stage box of a snake cable which runs from the stage to the mixer. The snake is then plugged into the mixer.

==Other features==
Most, but not all, audio mixers can

* use monaural signals to produce simulated stereo sound through panning.
* provide phantom power required by condenser microphones.

Some mixers can
* add onboard external effect units (reverb, echo, delay). Mixers with onboard digital effects typically offer a wide range of these effects.
* create an audible test tone via an oscillator. The test tone can be used to troubleshoot issues before the band arrives and determine if channels are functioning properly.
* read and write console automation.
* be interfaced with computers or other recording equipment.
* control or be controlled by a digital audio workstation via MIDI, USB or other communication interface.
* be powered by batteries.
* provide amplifier power for external passive speakers

===Mirroring===
Some mixing consoles, particularly those designed for broadcast and live sound, include facilities for &quot;mirroring&quot; two consoles, making both consoles exact copies of each other with the same inputs and outputs, the same settings, and the same audio mix. There are two primary reasons for doing this; one, in the event of a hardware failure, a second redundant console is already in place and can be switched to (an important feature for live broadcasts); second, it allows the operators to set up two identical mix positions, one at front of house — where the audio will be mixed during a performance — and the other at some other location within the theater (e.g., with the broadcasting equipment); this way, if the acoustics at front of house are unfavorable, a mix can be programmed at an acoustically better position in the room, and the presets (on the faders and knobs) can be accessed from the front of house console during the performance.

==Digital versus analog==

Digital mixing console sales have increased dramatically since their introduction in the 1990s. Yamaha sold more than 1000 PM5D mixers by July 2005, and other manufacturers are seeing increasing sales of their digital products. Digital mixers are more versatile than analog ones and offer many new features, such as reconfiguration of all signal routing at the touch of a button. In addition, digital consoles often include processing capabilities such as compression, gating, reverb, automatic feedback suppression and delay. Some products are expandable via third-party audio plug-ins that add further reverb, compression, delay and tone-shaping tools. Several digital mixers include spectrograph and real-time analyzer functions. A few incorporate loudspeaker management tools such as crossover filtering and limiting. Digital signal processing can perform automatic mixing for some simple applications, such as courtrooms, conferences and panel discussions.

===Latency===
Digital mixers have an unavoidable amount of latency, ranging from less than 1 ms to as much as 10 ms, depending on the model of digital mixer and what functions are engaged. This small amount of latency is not a problem for loudspeakers aimed at the audience and not necessarily a problem for monitor wedges aimed at the artist, but can be disorienting and unpleasant for in-ear monitors where the artist hears their voice acoustically in their head &quot;and&quot; electronically amplified in their ears but delayed by a couple of milliseconds.

Every analog to digital conversion and digital to analog conversion within a digital mixer introduces latency. Audio inserts to favorite external analog processors make for approximately double the usual latency. Further latency can be traced to format conversions such as from ADAT to AES3 and from normal digital signal processing steps.

Within a digital mixer, there can be differing amounts of latency, depending on the routing and on how much DSP is in use. Assigning a signal to two parallel paths with significantly different processing on each path can result in comb filtering when recombined. Some digital mixers incorporate internal methods of latency correction so that such problems are avoided.

===Ease of use===

Analog consoles have a column of dedicated, physical knobs, buttons, and faders for each channel, which is logical and familiar to generations of audio engineers who have been trained on analog mixers. This takes more physical space but can accommodate rapid responses to changing performance conditions.

Most digital mixers use technology to reduce physical space requirements, entailing compromises in user interface such as a single shared channel adjustment area that is selectable for only one channel at a time. Additionally, most digital mixers have virtual pages or layers that change fader banks into separate controls for additional inputs or for adjusting equalization or aux send levels. This layering can be confusing for some operators. Many digital mixers allow internal reassignment of inputs so that convenient groupings of inputs appear near each other in the fader bank, a feature that can be disorienting for persons having to make a hardware patch change.

On the other hand, many digital mixers allow for extremely easy building of a mix from saved data. USB flash drives and other storage methods are employed to bring past performance data to a new venue in a highly portable manner. At the new venue, the traveling mix engineer simply plugs the collected data into the venue&#x27;s digital mixer and quickly makes small adjustments to the local input and output patch layout, allowing for full show readiness in very short order. Some digital mixers allow offline editing of the mix, a feature that lets the traveling technician use a laptop to make anticipated changes to the show, shortening the time it takes to prepare the sound system for the artist.

===Sound quality===
Both digital and analog mixers rely on analog microphone preamplifiers, a high-gain circuit that increases the low signal level from a microphone to a level that is better matched to the console&#x27;s internal operating level. 

In a digital mixer, the microphone preamplifier is followed by an analog-to-digital converter. Ideally, this process is carefully engineered to deal gracefully with overloading and clipping while delivering an accurate digital stream. Overloading during further processing and mixing of digital streams can be avoided by using floating-point arithmetic. Intermediate processing in older systems using fixed-point arithmetic and final output in all digital systems must be controlled to avoid saturation.

Analog mixers, too, must deal gracefully with overloading and clipping at the microphone preamplifier and as well as avoiding overloading of mix buses. Noise is present at all stages of an analog mixer, though good gain stage management and turning unused channels down to zero minimizes its audibility. Digital circuitry is generally more resistant to outside interference from radio transmitters such as walkie-talkies and cell phones. 

Many electronic design elements combine to affect perceived sound quality, making the global &quot;analog mixer vs. digital mixer&quot; question difficult to answer. Experienced live sound professionals agree that the selection and quality of the microphones and loudspeakers (with their innate higher potential for creating distortion) are a much greater source of coloration of sound than the choice of mixer. The mixing style and experience of the person mixing may be more important than the make and model of audio console. Analog and digital mixers both have been associated with high-quality concert performances and studio recordings.

===Remote control===
Since the option first appeared associated with analog mixing the 1990s as wired remote controls for certain digital processes such as monitor wedge equalization and parameter changes in outboard reverb devices, the concept has expanded until wired and wireless remote controls are being seen in relation to entire digital mixing platforms. It is possible to set up a sound system and mix via laptop, touchscreen or tablet. Computer networks can connect digital system elements for expanded monitoring and control, allowing the system technician to make adjustments to distant devices during the performance. The use of remote control technology can reduce the amount of venue space used for the front-of-house mixing console, and recover space for audience seating.

===Software mixers===
For recorded sound, the mixing process can be performed on screen, using computer software and associated input, output and recording hardware. The traditional large control surface of the mixing console is not necessarily utilized. In a software studio, there is either no physical mixer fader bank at all or there is a compact group of motorized faders designed to fit into a small space and connected to the computer. Many project studios use such a space-efficient solution, as the mixing room at other times can serve as the business office, media archive, etc. Software mixing is integrated as part of a digital audio workstation.

==Applications==

Public address systems in schools, hospitals and other institutions use a mixing console to set microphones to an appropriate level and can add in recorded sounds such as music into the mix. PA mixers usually have controls that help to minimize audio feedback.

Most rock and pop bands use a mixing console to combine musical instruments and vocals so that the mix can be amplified through a nightclub&#x27;s PA system. Among the highest quality bootleg recordings of live performances are so-called soundboard recordings sourced directly from the mixing console.

Radio broadcasts use a mixing desk to select audio from different sources, such as CD players, telephones, remote feeds, prerecorded advertisements, and in-studio live bands. These consoles, often referred to as &quot;air-boards&quot; are apt to have many fewer controls than mixers designed for live or studio production mixing, dropping pan/balance, EQ, and multi-bus monitoring/aux feed knobs in favor of cue and output bus selectors, since, in a radio studio, nearly all sources are prerecorded or pre-adjusted.

DJs playing music at a dance club use a small DJ mixer to make smooth transitions between songs that are played from sources that are plugged into the mixer. Compared with other mixers that are used in sound recording and live sound, DJ mixers have far fewer inputs. The most basic DJ mixers have only two inputs, though some have four or more inputs for DJs using a larger number of sources. These sources could include turntables, CD players, portable media players, or electronic instruments such as drum machines or synthesizers. The DJ mixer also allows the DJ to use headphones to cue the next song to the desired starting point before playing it.

Hip hop music DJs and Dub producers and engineers were early users of the mixing board as a musical instrument. In the 1970s, hip-hop DJs developed a technique of adjusting the fader and crossfader controls of mixers at the same time as they manipulated records on turntables, creating unique rhythmic &quot;scratching&quot; effects.

Noise music musicians may create feedback loops within mixers, creating an instrument known as a &quot;no-input mixer&quot;. The tones generated from a no-input mixer are created by connecting an output of the mixer into an input channel and manipulating the pitch with the mixer&#x27;s dials.

<doc id="193300" wikidata="Q28737" url="?curid=193300" title="Military justice">
<text>Military justice (or military law) is the body of laws and procedures governing members of the armed forces. Many nation-states have separate and distinct bodies of law that govern the conduct of members of their armed forces. Some states use special judicial and other arrangements to enforce those laws, while others use civilian judicial systems. Legal issues unique to military justice include the preservation of good order and discipline, the legality of orders, and appropriate conduct for members of the military. Some states enable their military justice systems to deal with civil offenses committed by their armed forces in some circumstances.

Military justice is distinct from martial law, which is the imposition of military authority on a civilian population as a substitute for civil authority, and is often declared in times of emergency, war, or civil unrest. Most countries restrict when and in what manner martial law may be declared and enforced.

==Canada==
All Commands of the Canadian Forces (CF) (that is, Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Air Force, Canadian Joint Operations Command, and Canadian Special Operations Forces Command) are primarily governed by the National Defence Act (NDA). Section 12 of the NDA§ authorizes the governor in council&#x27;s creation of the Queen&#x27;s Regulations and Orders (QR&amp;Os). The QR&amp;Os are subordinate legislation having the force of law. Since the principle of &quot;delegatus non-potest delegare&quot; has not achieved rigid standing in Canada, the QR&amp;Os authorize other military officials to generate orders having similar, but not equal, status. These instruments can be found in the Canadian Forces Administrative Orders and Defence Administrative Orders and Directives; they are used as direction for authorities within the CF to administer the day-to-day considerations of the Forces. For example, officer cadets attending military college are organized and subject to regulations more appropriate for their academic success than the enforcement of discipline, as might be expected of fully trained members. Volume IV, Appendix 6.1 of The Queen&#x27;s Regulations and Orders for the Canadian Military Colleges (QR Canmilcols) applies.

A judge advocate general (JAG) has headed the Canadian military legal branch since before the First World War. The branch interprets the Canadian Forces&#x27; own internal rules and in the Code of Service Discipline, and also international and humanitarian laws and codes of war, such as the Geneva Conventions. In Canadian practice, armed combat is a strictly regulated environment and legal officers are a crucial part of the planning that goes into operational decisions. The Military Law Centre on the grounds of Royal Military College of Canada, staffed with military lawyers, oversees the education of officers and troops in legal matters, trains military lawyers and advises Ottawa on matters of policy and doctrine. Legal education is integrated into the regular training that CF members undergo.

==Finland==

===Jurisdiction===
The Finnish military law concerns the members of the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard. The military jurisdiction encompasses all military persons: conscripts, students training for a paid military position, females serving voluntarily and paid military personnel. However, military chaplains are outside the criminal military jurisdiction.
Reservists belong to the military jurisdiction when activated voluntarily or involuntarily. The military jurisdiction starts from the moment when a person reports to duty or was liable to report to duty and lasts to the moment when the person has been discharged from service and, in case of conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists, has also left the military area. During wartime, also civilians serving in the Defence Forces or in civilian institutions that have been put under the direction of Defence Forces are under military jurisdiction. Enemy prisoners of war fall under Finnish military jurisdiction during their imprisonment.

===Military crimes===
As in Germany, persons under military jurisdiction are under the usual civilian criminal law. The military criminal law, the 45th Chapter of the penal code, encompasses only the crimes which only military persons can commit. The most important of these are various types of &quot;service crime&quot; (, ) which encompasses all voluntary and negligent disobedience of orders and regulations, &quot;guard crime&quot; (, ), encompassing any misdeed during guarding duty, absence without leave (, ), desertion (, ), diverse forms of disobedience against superiors, misuses of a position as superior and behaviour unsuitable for military person (, ). Other crimes are subject to usual civilian law.

The military has a jurisdiction to investigate all military crimes proper, and also a number of other crimes that have been specifically listed as belonging to the military jurisdiction. These include e.g. various types of murder, assault, theft, fraud, forgery, computer hacking and illegal divulging of classified information. However, they are only under military jurisdiction if the crime has been committed against another military person or against the Defence Forces.

Unlike other crimes, the military crimes have separate sentence ranges for peace and wartime. During wartime, the crimes carry considerably larger sentence ranges and, if the crime causes the danger to the military unit, the sentence range is even harsher. For example, desertion carries, in the peacetime, a sentence of disciplinary punishment or up to one year in prison. During wartime, it carries a mandatory prison sentence of not more than four years, and, if the crime caused a particularly immediate danger to the unit, a mandatory minimum of one year, with a maximum sentence of ten years.

When the military has jurisdiction over an ordinary crime, and the crime carries fine as a punishment, a disciplinary punishment may be given instead of fine both in summary proceedings and in the courts of law.

===Investigation and summary discipline===
When the crime falls under military jurisdiction, it is usually investigated by the serviceman&#x27;s own unit. During such investigation, the serviceman&#x27;s superior and the company commander have the power to detain the suspect. The battalion commander and military police officers have also the right to arrest the suspect and to conduct searches inside a military area.

When the company commander or his superior feels that the crime is non-trivial and requires professional investigation, they may submit the issue to the Defence Command for investigation. The Defence Command has, in addition to the power of arrest, the power to use almost all other measures that are available to the Finnish police. If the Defence Command requires the use of the most invasive investigative measures (e.g. wiretaps, use of deep cover agents or computer intrusion) they may either request the police to conduct the measure or hand over the case to the police, as agreed between the investigator and the competent policeman. If the police considers it necessary, they may always take the case over, however.

In the Border Guard, the Border Guard headquarters has the same internal law enforcement authority as the Defence Command in the Defence Forces, in addition to the regular law enforcement powers of the Border Guard.

When the investigation is ready, the case is brought to the company commander or sergeant major or for his superior for consideration. After hearing the suspect, the disposing superior either frees the suspect from suspicion or gives an appropriate punishment within the range allowed to him. The range is
* Company sergeant major: a private warning, up to three shifts of extra duty (only to conscripts and involuntarily activated reservists)
* Company commander: a private warning, up to five shifts of extra duty, up to 10 days of confinement to the garrison, a public letter of reprimand (, )
* Battalion commander, all of above, and up to fifteen days of confinement to garrison
* Brigade commander and his superiors: all of above and up to 30 disciplinary fines, one disciplinary fine being one fifth of the individual&#x27;s daily gross income, or for conscripts, at least conscript&#x27;s daily allowance.

During peacetime, professional soldiers (with the exception of certain soldiers deployed to international missions) cannot be given other disciplinary punishment than a public letter of reprimand or a fine.

If the superior does not feel that his powers allow him to give sufficient punishment, he will transfer the matter to the next higher superior. When the brigade commander determines that he cannot give sufficient punishment, he will transfer the matter to the public prosecutor who will commence prosecution in a civilian court. If the serviceman feels that the punishment was unjust, he can appeal to the brigade commander. The brigade commander&#x27;s decision can be appealed to the district court within seven days. However, the appeals will not prevent the execution of the punishment.

===Trial and appeals===

The military crimes that go to court are handled by civilian courts that have military members. The district court has a learned civilian judge and two military members. One of them is an officer and the other a warrant officer, an NCO or a private. The court of appeals, that acts as the first instance for the prosecution of officers with at least major&#x27;s rank, will have a military member who has at least a major&#x27;s rank. The Supreme Court of Finland has two officers with at least colonel&#x27;s rank as members when handling military crimes. These members are not named for a specific case but serve for two-year terms. The military members of the district court are selected by the court of appeals on the motion of the Commander of the Finnish Army. The military members of the Courts of Appeals are selected by the Ministry of Justice on motion of the Ministry of Defence. The military members of the Supreme Court are selected by the President of Finland.

The sentences of the courts for military crimes are served in civilian prisons. An exception is formed by the disciplinary arrest, which may be sentenced for up to 30 days and is served in the detention facilities of the convict&#x27;s garrison.

When the military person holds a permanent or temporary paid position as a state military servant (, ), as all officers and NCOs in regular active service do, they will be sentenced to dismissal (, ) in addition to other punishments, if they are convicted of a military or a civilian crime for more than two years in prison and there are no special grounds for leniency. If the sentence is a life sentence, dismissal is mandatory. The court may also sentence dismissal with a shorter prison sentence if the crime shows that the person is unsuitable for state employment.

If the military person is no longer in service, the summary disciplinary procedure cannot be used and the military has no longer any law enforcement power over the issue. In such cases, the former service member is investigated by the civilian police but the case is handled by a court with military members. In sentencing, disciplinary punishments cannot be used. Instead if a disciplinary punishment, an ordinary day-fine is sentenced. Typically, this is the case when a reservist is absent from an obligatory refresher exercise or a conscript is, after the commission of crime, declared unfit for duty for medical or security reasons.

===Administrative punishment===
In addition to judicial dismissal, the Defence Forces and the Border Guard have the option of administratively ending the military person&#x27;s service if the person is in a paid position. This can happen even if no criminal charges are pressed. In the Defence Forces, the professional serviceman can also be administratively suspended for a period of one to six months. Similarly to state military servants, persons serving in a deployed force on an international mission may be administratively dismissed by the commander of the Finnish contingent. A conscript or a reservist cannot be dismissed but their service can be suspended by the brigade commander if they are suspected of having committed a crime which shows that they may endanger the safety of others. Following this, the person may be declared permanently unfit for duty by the Defence Forces regional office for safety and security reasons.

As an exception to the principle that the military jurisdiction concerns only military persons, the penal code provides for the loss of military rank. Any person who is sentenced to prison for at least two years or to prison for any length of time for a crime of treasonous nature (specifically, crimes in chapters 11 and 12 of the Penal Code, e.g. espionage, high treason and related crimes), shall be sentenced to lose their military rank also. Thus, not only active military persons but also retired personnel, reservists and persons who are too old to belong to reserve may lose their military ranks for crimes of civilian nature.

===Statistics===
Military crimes are relatively common in Finland. Partly this is due to the fact that the bar of criminality has been set consciously low. The crime of absence without leave is committed by a soldier who is even a minute late, and a slightest wilful or negligent disregard for a standing order or a regulation fulfils the indicia of the &quot;service crime&quot;. The legislator has purposefully given the military superiors the legal tools by which to maintain discipline by punishing even the slight appearances of bad conduct if they feel it necessary. On the other hand, handing out unofficial punishments is discouraged in the extreme.

The number of military crimes is yearly somewhat above 4,000. An absolute majority of these are handled by summary measures, i.e. by a punishments given by the military superiors. Only some 250 military crimes in a year end up for handling in district courts. The number of appeals is vanishingly small. In year 2014, courts of appeals handled only a total of 5 military criminal cases.

==Germany==
Members of any branch of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, the German armed forces, are subject to the ordinary civil jurisdiction and unless otherwise stated all civil laws apply to soldiers as well.

The German constitution allows the federal government in art. 96 II to create military courts under special circumstances: in times of war, outside Germany or on a German vessel, acting under a legal judge and only for members of the armed forces. In fact, no such laws have been enacted so far. Instead, suspects of crimes committed abroad are subject to the district attorney of the city of Potsdam. The reason is that the operational headquarters (&quot;Einsatzführungskommando&quot;) is located there.

Nonetheless, there exist numerous acts that only concern soldiers describing their special status, their rights and duties. The military penal code (&quot;Wehrstrafgesetz&quot;) applies to soldiers by extending the civil penal code (&quot;Strafgesetzbuch&quot;) to crimes that can be only committed on military duty: General offenses (such as desertion, illegal use of weapons and more) and offenses that interfere with the military hierarchy (such as mutiny or abuse).

Law enforcing inside any branch is done by the military police, the &quot;Feldjäger&quot;. When investigating, working for the attorney is equivalent to any German police in civil issues. In cases of both groups involved (on German terrain), regular and military police cooperate. In emergencies, the regular police is authorized to maintain order until the military police has arrived.

Soldiers that violate military regulations may also receive penalties in form of Non-judicial punishment or in severe cases judicial punishments by a special type of court. These procedures are defined by the military discipline code (&quot;Wehrdisziplinarordnung&quot;, WDO). The WDO describes how to proceed on offenses that are not (yet) covered by the military penal code but clearly against a military regulation. The head of the unit as immediate superior who acts as primary disciplinary master has the exclusive right to choose: non-judicial punishment (such as fines, curfews, arrests up to seven days), forwarding the decision to the next superior officer of the unit (arrest then can be extended up to 21 days) or calling the military service court (&quot;Truppendienstgericht&quot;) which has the power for further punishment (like degradation and shortening the salary up to five years). The judge of such a court is a civil one, two military officers are attending every case and act as consultants to the judge.

In Germany, there are no federal or military prisons. If a soldier is sentenced to jail for up to six months, the punishment is executed by the soldier&#x27;s barracks administration. He will remain in arrest for the same time but continue serving in his unit on duty times unless the court has imposed further limits. Otherwise soldiers will be detained in civil state prisons. In the case of a soldier being sentenced to jail for one year or more (six months or more in case of bribery) he will be discharged from the armed forces.

==India==
India has its own Army Act, Navy Act and Air Force Act.
These laws define the statutory provisions as applicable to men and women in uniform. All these three Acts are available on search from the official website.
There are certain para military forces in India too who have laws akin to the ones applicable to defence services. This includes the Border Security Force Act, Coast Guard Act, Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force Act and the Assam Rifles Act. All such Acts draw their inspiration from the Army Act.

The military courts in India are coming under extreme stress with the establishment of Armed Forces Tribunal in 2007. There is increasing voice in the country for the reform on the lines other liberal democracies are seeing in their military justice system.

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom&#x27;s arrangements for justice in the armed forces dates back many centuries to the Articles of War. In the late 19th Century this was added to the annual Army Act and embodied in the Naval Discipline Act. The Air Force Act was added in 1918. In 1966 a process of harmonisation started with the introduction of a quinquennial Armed Forces Act. The Armed Forces Act 2006 replaces the three separate service discipline acts and earlier Armed Forces Acts as the system of law under which the Armed Forces operate. In the previous decade the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) had considerable impact on the administration of military justice, particularly the need for the independence of the courts martial system. Nevertheless, the underlying premise of the service justice system is that discipline is a matter for commanders.

The Armed Forces Act 2006 completed the harmonisation of service law, and took full effect on 1 November 2009. Guidance about its application and related matters are provided in the Manual of Service Law. One motivating factor behind the changes in the legislation combining discipline acts across the armed forces is the trend towards tri-service operations and defence organisations. It deals with military offences, civil offences committed in some circumstances, offences by civilians associated with the armed forces or with the armed forces overseas (including family members), authority of Commanding Officer to deal with offences summarily, the Court Martial, the Service Civilian Court, custody and appeals. The Act also creates the post of the Director of Service Prosecutions.

Summary dealing by a Commanding Officer (CO) is the central feature, this is acceptable within the ECHR because an accused always has the right to elect trial by the Court Martial. Most cases are dealt with summarily. Typically a CO is a Lieutenant Colonel or equivalent (NATO grade OF-4), but a CO may delegate some powers of summary dealing to a subordinate. The superior officer of a CO, a Higher Authority, may vary a CO&#x27;s powers of summary dealing. An implication is that every person subject to service law must have a CO, and a CO must have a Higher Authority.

The military judicial system is headed by the Judge Advocate General who is a civilian and part of the Ministry of Justice.

Administrative procedures enable a service man or woman to be discharged for unsatisfactory behaviour in a process similar to that in the private sector. They also allow a superior of any rank to award up to three extra duties or similar to a subordinate for minor infractions. Since being introduced this has significantly reduced the number of cases dealt with summarily.

==United States==
The United States Constitution authorized the creation of a system of military justice. Article I, Section 8 permits the U.S. Congress to &quot;make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.&quot; Congress issued these rules first in 1806 as the Articles of War. Military justice during the American Civil War was governed by the 1863 Lieber Code. The Articles of War were superseded in 1951 by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).

The UCMJ is federal law, found in Title 10 United States Code Chapter 47, and implemented by the Manual for Courts-Martial, an executive order issued by the President of the United States in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. Court-martial convictions in the United States may be appealed through military courts of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), a federal appellate court consisting of five civilian judges appointed by the President of the United States. CAAF decisions are subject to direct review by the Supreme Court of the United States.

The offenses covered by the UCMJ include those encompassed by &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; which covers officials generally, and includes perjury of oath, abuse of authority, bribery, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming, and refusal to obey a lawful order. It also includes ordinary crimes, but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for civilians, on the grounds that more is expected of military personnel by their oaths of office. Many of the terms used date back to the era during which the code was written.

<doc id="193303" wikidata="Q640630" url="?curid=193303" title="Ira Hayes">
<text>Ira Hamilton Hayes (January 12, 1923 – January 24, 1955) was an Akimel O&#x27;odham American and a United States Marine during World War II. Hayes was an enrolled member of the Gila River Indian Community, located in Pinal and Maricopa counties in Arizona. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve on August 26, 1942, and, after recruit training, volunteered to become a Paramarine. He fought in the Bougainville and Iwo Jima campaigns in the Pacific War.

Hayes was generally known as one of the six men who appeared in the iconic photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; by photographer Joe Rosenthal. The first flag raised over Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945 at the south end of Iwo Jima, was deemed too small and was replaced the same day by a larger flag. A photo of the second flag-raising, which included Hayes in it, became famous and was widely reproduced. After the battle, Hayes and two other men were identified as surviving second flag-raisers and were reassigned to help raise funds for the Seventh War Loan drive. In 1946, after his service in the Marine Corps, he was instrumental in revealing the correct identity of one of the Marines in the photograph.

After the war, Hayes suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and descended into alcoholism. On November 10, 1954, he attended the dedication of the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, which was modeled after the photograph of Hayes and five other Marines raising the second flag on Iwo Jima. After a night of heavy drinking on January 23–24, 1955, he died of exposure due to the cold and alcohol poisoning. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on February 2, 1955.

Hayes was commemorated in art and film, before and after his death. In 1949, he portrayed himself raising the flag in the movie &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;, starring John Wayne. He was the subject of an article by journalist William Bradford Huie, which was adapted for the feature film &quot;The Outsider&quot; (1961), starring Tony Curtis as Hayes. The movie inspired songwriter Peter La Farge to write &quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes,&quot; which became popular nationwide in 1964 after being recorded by Johnny Cash. In 2006, Hayes was portrayed by Adam Beach in the World War II movie &quot;Flags of Our Fathers,&quot; directed by Clint Eastwood.

==Early life==
Ira Hayes was born in Sacaton, Arizona, a town in the Gila River Indian Community in Pinal County. He was the eldest of six children born to Nancy Whitaker (1901–1972) and Joseph Hayes (1901–1986). The Hayes children were: Ira (1923–1955), Harold (1924–1925), Leonard (1925–1962), Kenneth (1931–2019), Arlene (1933–1938) and Vernon (1937–1957). Joseph Hayes was a World War I veteran who supported his family by subsistence farming and its cotton harvesting. Nancy Hayes was a devout Presbyterian and a Sunday school teacher at the Assemblies of God church in Sacaton.

Hayes was remembered by his family and friends as being a shy and sensitive child. Sara Bernal, his niece, said, &quot;Ira Hayes was a very quiet man; he would go days without saying anything unless you spoke to him first. The other Hayes children would play and tease me, but not Ira. He was quiet, and somewhat distant. Ira didn&#x27;t speak unless spoken to. He was just like his father.&quot; His boyhood friend Dana Norris said, &quot;Even though I&#x27;m from the same culture, I could never get under his skin. Ira had the characteristic of not wanting to talk. But we Pimas are not prone to tooting our own horns. Ira was a quiet guy, such a quiet guy.&quot; Despite this, Hayes was a precocious child who displayed an impressive grasp of the English language, a language that many Pima never learned to speak. He learned to read and write by the age of four and was a voracious reader.

In 1932, the family settled in Bapchule, Arizona, approximately 12 miles northwest of Sacaton. The Hayes children attended grade school in Sacaton and high school at the Phoenix Indian School in Phoenix, Arizona.

Ira Hayes was working as a carpenter during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hayes confided to his classmate Eleanor Pasquale after the Japanese attack that he was determined to serve in the United States Marine Corps. Pasquale said, &quot;Every morning in school, [the students] would get a report on World War II. We would sing the anthems of the Army, Marines, and the Navy.&quot; Hayes completed two years at the Phoenix Indian School and served in the Civilian Conservation Corps in May and June 1942. He worked as a carpenter before enlisting in the military.

==US Marine Corps==

===World War II===

Hayes enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve on August 26, 1942. He completed recruit training in Platoon 701 at Marine Corps Base, San Diego (renamed in 1948 to Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego) and in October volunteered for Marine paratrooper (Paramarine) training at the Marine Parachute School at Camp Gillespie located east of San Diego. Ira Hayes became the first Pima in history to receive his paratrooper wings, to which he received the codename of &quot;Chief Falling Cloud&quot;. On November 30, he graduated from the Parachute Training School and received his silver &quot;jump wings&quot;. On December 1, he was promoted to private first class.

On December 2, 1942, he joined Company B, 3rd Parachute Battalion, Divisional Special Troops, 3rd Marine Division, at Camp Elliott, California. On March 14, 1943, Hayes sailed for New Caledonia with the 3rd Parachute Battalion, which was assigned to Camp Kiser there on March 25 until September 26; the unit was redesignated in April as Company K, 3rd Parachute Battalion, 1st Marine Parachute Regiment of the I Marine Amphibious Corps. The 3rd Parachute Battalion was shipped to Guadalcanal and remained there until it was sent to Vella Lavella, arriving on October 14 for occupational duty. On December 4, Hayes landed with the 3rd Parachute Battalion on Bougainville and fought against the Japanese as a platoon automatic rifleman (BAR man) with Company K during the Bougainville Campaign. The 3rd Parachute Battalion was shipped back to Guadalcanal, and he stayed there until sometime in February, when the Paramarines were sent back to California. The 1st Parachute Regiment was officially disbanded at Camp Pendleton, California, in February 1944.

Hayes was transferred to Company E, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment of the newly activated 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. Hayes sailed to Hawaii with his company in September for continued training with the 5th division at Camp Tarawa as it trained for the invasion and capture of Iwo Jima.

====Battle of Iwo Jima====

The 5th Marine Division landed on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. Easy Company, Second Battalion, 28th Marines, landed on the southern beach near Mount Suribachi off of after transferring from . The island was defended by over 20,000 Japanese soldiers who were entrenched in fortifications and willing to fight to the death. At the end, only 216 Japanese soldiers would survive the battle.

====First flag-raising====

After four days of fighting, the Marines finally made their way onto the slopes of the mountain. On February 23, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, the Second Battalion commander, ordered a combat patrol to climb, seize, and occupy the top of Mount Suribachi (an inactive volcano) and raise the battalion&#x27;s flag if possible to signal it was secure. Captain Dave Severance, commander of E Company, organized a 40-man patrol taken from the remainder of his Third Platoon and the battalion. First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, the company&#x27;s executive officer, was chosen by Lt. Col. Johnson to be in command of the patrol. At 8:30 am, the patrol started to climb the east slope of Suribachi. The patrol included two Navy corpsmen and stretcher bearers. Less than an hour later, after receiving occasional Japanese sniper fire, the patrol reached the rim of the volcano. After a brief firefight there, Lt. Schrier and his men captured the summit. After finding a Japanese steel pipe and attaching the flag to it, the flagstaff was taken to the highest place on the crater. At about 10:30 a.m., Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas, Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg raised the flag. Seeing the raising of the national colors immediately caused loud cheering from the Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships docked at the beach. Due to the high winds on Mount Suribachi, Sgt. Hansen, Private Phil Ward, and Navy corpsman John Bradley pitched in to help make the flagstaff stay in a vertical position. The men at, around, and holding the flagstaff were photographed several times by Marine Staff Sergeant Louis R. Lowery, a photographer with &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine who accompanied the patrol up the mountain. Platoon Sgt. Thomas was killed on Iwo Jima on March 3 and Sgt. Hansen was killed on March 1.

====Second flag-raising====


The first flag flying over Mount Suribachi at the south end of Iwo Jima was regarded to be too small to be seen by the thousands of Marines fighting on the other side of Iwo Jima. The Marines in command and Lt. Col. Johnson decided that a larger flag should be taken on top and flown on the mountain. In the early afternoon, Capt. Severance ordered Sgt. Michael Strank a rifle squad leader from Second Platoon, E Company, to ascend Mount Suribachi with three Marines from his squad and raise the larger flag. Sgt. Strank then ordered Cpl. Harlon Block, Pfc. Hayes, and Pfc. Franklin Sousley to go with him up Suribachi with supplies (or communication wire). Pfc. Rene Gagnon the Second Battalion&#x27;s runner (messenger) for E Company was ordered to take &quot;walkie-talkie&quot; batteries and the replacement flag up the mountain, and return the first flag to the battalion adjutant down below.

When all five Marines were on top, a Japanese steel pipe was found by Pfc. Hayes and Pfc. Sousley who carried the pipe to Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block near the first flag. The second flag was attached to the pipe and, as Sgt. Strank and his three Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, he yelled out to two nearby Marines from Schrier&#x27;s patrol to help them raise it. At approximately 1 p.m., Lt. Schrier ordered the raising of the second flag and the lowering of the original flag. The second flag was raised by Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. Harold Schultz, and Pfc. Harold Keller. After the flag was raised, rocks were added at the bottom of the flagstaff by Pfc. Schultz and Pfc. Keller, which was then stabilized by three guy-ropes because of the high winds on top.

The raising of the second American flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, was immortalized by Associated Press combat photographer Joe Rosenthal and became an icon of the world war.

On March 14, another American flag was officially raised up a flagpole by two Marines under the orders of Lieutenant General Holland Smith during a ceremony at the V Amphibious Corps command post on the other side of Mount Suribachi where the 3rd Marine Division troops were located to signal the Marines occupied Iwo Jima. The flag flying on top of Mount Suribachi that Hayes helped raise was taken down.

Hayes fought on the island until it was secure on March 26. The same day, he attended the service for the American troops buried at the 5th Marine Division Cemetery. Hayes boarded the and left Iwo Jima with his unit for Hawaii on March 27. Easy Company had many casualties, Hayes was one of five marines remaining from his original platoon of forty-five men, including their corpsmen. Sgt. Strank and Cpl. Block were killed on Iwo Jima on March 1, and Pfc. Sousley was killed on March 21.

====7th war bond selling tour====

Once he arrived in Hawaii, Hayes continued to train with E Company at Camp Tarawa. During the battle President Roosevelt had ordered that the flag raisers in Joe Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph be sent immediately after the battle to Washington, D.C., to appear as a public morale factor. Pfc. Gagnon had returned with E Company to Camp Tarawa when he was ordered on April 3 to report to Marine Corps headquarters at Washington, D.C. He arrived on April 7, and was questioned by a lieutenant colonel at Marine Corps public information office concerning the identities of the flag raisers in the Rosenthal photo. Gagnon named Marines Michael Strank (KIA), Henry Hansen (KIA), Franklin Sousley (KIA), Ira Hayes, Navy corpsman John Bradley, and himself. On April 8, the Marine Corps gave a press release of the names of the six flag raisers in the Rosenthal photograph which had been given by Gagnon including Hayes&#x27;. Hayes and Bradley were ordered to report to Marine Corps headquarters; After the war, the Marine Corps determined that Hansen (1947), Bradley (2016), and Gagnon (2019) were not second flag-raisers.

President Roosevelt died on April 12, and Vice President Harry S. Truman was sworn in as President the same day. After Bradley was evacuated from Iwo Jima in March, he was recovering from his wounds at Oakland Naval Hospital in Oakland, California when he was ordered to Washington. He was transferred to Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where he was shown Rosenthal&#x27;s flag-raising photograph and was told he was in it. Bradley arrived in Washington, D.C., on crutches on or about April 19. Hayes left Hawaii on April 15 and arrived in Washington on April 19 and was assigned to C Company, 1st Headquarters Battalion, Marine Corps Headquarters. Both men were questioned separately by the same Marine officer that Gagnon met with concerning the identities of the six flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. Bradley agreed with all six names of the flag raisers in the photo given by Gagnon including his own. Hayes agreed with all the names including his own except he said that the man identified as Sgt. Hansen at the base of the flagstaff in the photo was really Cpl. Harlon Block. The Marine interviewer then told Hayes that a list of the names of the six flag-raisers in the photo were already released publicly; and besides Block and Hansen were both killed in action (during the Marine Corps investigation in 1946, the lieutenant colonel denied Hayes ever mentioned Block&#x27;s name to him).

After the interview over, it was requested that Pfc. Gagnon, Pfc. Hayes, and Navy corpsman Bradley participate in the Seventh War Loan drive to help defray the massive war debt by selling war bonds. On April 20, Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley met President Truman at the White House and each showed him their positions in the second flag raising poster that was on display there for the upcoming bond tour that they would participate in. A press conference was also held that day and Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley were questioned about the flag raising.

On May 9, a flag-raising by Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Gagnon, and PhM2c. Bradley during a ceremony at the nation&#x27;s capital kicked off the bond-selling tour; the flag was the same one that had been raised on Mount Suribachi. The tour began on May 11 in New York City. On May 24, Pfc. Hayes was ordered to report to the 28th Marines in Hawaii. Pfc. Hayes left Washington on May 25 and arrived at Hilo, Hawaii on May 29 by plane and rejoined E Company at Camp Tarawa. Pfc. Gagnon and PhM2c. Bradley finished the tour in Washington, D.C., on July 4. The bond tour was held in 33 American cities that raised over $26 billion to help pay for and win the war.

On June 19, Pfc. Hayes was promoted to corporal. He served on occupation duty in Japan with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines from September 22 to October 26, 1945. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton, California on December 1, 1945. On February 21, 1946, Hayes was awarded a Navy Commendation from the Marine Corps for meritorious service in combat during World War II.

==Post World War II==

Hayes attempted to lead a normal civilian life after the war. &quot;I kept getting hundreds of letters. And people would drive through the reservation, walk up to me and ask, &#x27;Are you the Indian who raised the flag on Iwo Jima?&#x27;&quot;
Although Hayes rarely spoke about the flag raising, he talked more generally about his service in the Marine Corps with great pride.

Hayes seemed to be disturbed that Harlon Block was still being misrepresented publicly as &quot;Hank&quot; Hansen. In May 1946, Hayes walked and hitchhiked 1,300 miles from the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona to Edward Frederick Block, Sr.&#x27;s farm in Weslaco, Texas, to reveal the truth to Block&#x27;s parents about their son Harlon being in Rosenthal&#x27;s flag raising photograph. He was instrumental in having the mistaken second flag-raiser controversy resolved by the Marine Corps in January 1947. Block&#x27;s family, especially his mother, was grateful to Hayes. She said that she had known from the time she first saw the famous picture in the newspaper that it was her son in the photo. Mrs. Block wrote Hayes about her son and he wrote her back in July 1946. She then contacted Texas Congressman Milton West about Hayes&#x27; letter which started a Marine Corps investigation in December.

John &quot;Jack&quot; Thurman, who appears at the far left of Rosenthal&#x27;s &quot;Gung Ho&quot; photograph (below, right) recounted a story of his friendship with Ira who was at the far left of the photo next to Jack. Jack recounted at a breakfast meeting that, sometime after the war, Ira hitchhiked across the country to visit him at his home farm in Mitchell, South Dakota. Ira arrived while Jack was away from the farm and Jack&#x27;s mother would not allow Ira to wait at the house and made him wait at the end of the driveway by the road. Jack noted his mother &quot;did not like Indians&quot;. Once all was explained when Jack got home, Ira was welcomed into the house. Jack remained friends with Ira until his death.

In 1949, Hayes appeared briefly as himself in the film &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima,&quot; starring John Wayne. In the movie, Wayne hands the American flag to Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley, who at the time were considered the three surviving second flag-raisers (the second flag that was raised on Mount Suribachi is used in the film and is handed directly to Gagnon).

After this Hayes was unable to hold onto a steady job for a long period, as he had become an alcoholic. He was arrested 52 times for alcohol intoxication in public at various places in the country, including Chicago in October 1953. Hayes held a variety of jobs, including being a chauffeur to Elizabeth Martin, former wife of Dean Martin, where he lived in her Beverly Hills home for several months but couldn&#x27;t stop drinking. Referring to his alcoholism, he once said: &quot;I was sick. I guess I was about to crack up thinking about all my good buddies. They were better men than me and they&#x27;re not coming back. Much less back to the White House, like me.&quot; Hayes was sober while attending the Marine Corps War Memorial dedication on November 10, 1954. Hayes met President Dwight D. Eisenhower who lauded him as a hero. A reporter there approached Hayes and asked him, &quot;How do you like the pomp and circumstance?&quot; Hayes hung his head and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t.&quot;

His disquiet about his unwanted fame and his subsequent post-war problems were first recounted in detail by the author William Bradford Huie in &quot;The Outsider&quot;, published in 1959 as part of his collection &quot;Wolf Whistle and Other Stories&quot;. &quot;The Outsider&quot;, filmed in 1961, was directed by World War II veteran turned film director Delbert Mann and starred Tony Curtis as Hayes. The 2006 film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood, suggests that Hayes suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

==Death==
On the morning of January 24, 1955, Hayes was found dead lying near an abandoned adobe hut near where he lived in Sacaton, Arizona. He had been drinking and playing cards on the reservation with his friends and brothers Vernon and Kenneth. An altercation ensued between Hayes and a Pima Indian named Henry Setoyant, and all left except Hayes and Setoyant. The Pinal County coroner concluded that Hayes&#x27;s death was caused by exposure and alcohol poisoning. However, his brother Kenneth, a Korean War veteran, believed that the death resulted from the altercation with Setoyant. The reservation police did not conduct an investigation into Hayes&#x27;s death, and Setoyant denied any allegations of fighting with Hayes. There was no autopsy.

In the film &quot;The Outsider&quot;, his death is dramatized for the screen. He is shown drunk and freezing on a mountain top and unable to climb down. He falls asleep and is shown frozen to death with his arm and hand reaching upwards, like the time he raised the flag on Mount Suribachi. In the song &quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes&quot;, he was described as being drunk and drowning in two inches of water in a ditch, not noting the cold.

On February 2, 1955, Hayes was buried in Section 34, Grave 479A at Arlington National Cemetery. At the funeral, Rene Gagnon (incorrectly thought to be a flag raiser until 2019, when it was correctly identified as Harold Keller) said of him: &quot;Let&#x27;s say he had a little dream in his heart that someday the Indian would be like the white man — be able to walk all over the United States.&quot;
== Marine Corps War Memorial ==

The Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Memorial) in Arlington County, Virginia, was dedicated on November 10, 1954. The monument was sculpted by Felix de Weldon from the image of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi. Ira Hayes is depicted as the sixth bronze figure from the base of the flagstaff on the memorial with the 32 foot (9.8 M) bronze figures of the other five flag-raisers depicted on the memorial.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower sat upfront during the dedication ceremony with Vice President Richard Nixon, Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Anderson, and General Lemuel C. Shepherd, the 20th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Hayes, one of the three surviving flag raisers depicted on the monument, was also seated upfront with John Bradley (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until June 23, 2016), Rene Gagnon (incorrectly identified as a flag raiser until October 16, 2019), Mrs Martha Strank, Mrs. Ada Belle Block, and Mrs. Goldie Price (mother of Franklin Sousley). Those giving remarks at the dedication included Robert Anderson, Chairman of Day, Colonel J.W. Moreau, U.S. Marine Corps (Retired), President, Marine Corps War Memorial Foundation, General Shepherd who presented the memorial to the American people, Felix de Weldon, and Richard Nixon who gave the dedication address. Inscribed on the memorial are the following words:

:In Honor And Memory Of The Men of The United States Marine Corps Who Have Given Their Lives To Their Country Since 10 November 1775

===1993 Marine Corps commemoration===

On November 10, 1993, the United States Marine Corps held a ceremony at the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington County., Virginia, commemorating the 218th anniversary of the Marine Corps. Of Ira Hayes, USMC Commandant General Carl Mundy said:

== Military awards ==
Hayes&#x27; Navy Commendation Ribbon was updated to the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot; for meritorious service. He rates the Navy Combat Action Ribbon for combat participation in World War II. The &quot; silver star on his Navy Presidential Unit Citation ribbon was a Marine Corps, World War II, campaign participation star (discontinued) for Iwo Jima, not a second Presidential Unit Citation award (&quot; bronze star). Hayes did not meet the Marine Corps four-year (48 months) service requirement in World War II for the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal.

Hayes&#x27; military decorations and awards:

=== U.S. Marine Corps Commendation ===

==Portrayal in music, film and literature==
Hayes&#x27;s story was immortalized in the song &quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes&quot; by Peter LaFarge, which was subsequently covered by numerous artists including Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Pete Seeger, Townes Van Zandt, and Bob Dylan. In 1964, Cash took the song to number 3 on the Billboard country music chart.

Ira Hayes is the subject of the song, &quot;Blinding Flashes&quot; written by The Rumjacks.

Ira Hayes appeared as himself in the 1949 John Wayne film, &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;. In the 1960 telefilm &quot;The American&quot;, he was played by World War II Marine veteran Lee Marvin. Tony Curtis played Hayes in the 1961 film &quot;The Outsider&quot;. Hayes was portrayed by Adam Beach in the 2006 movie &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood. The movie was based on the 2000 bestselling book of the same name by James Bradley and Ron Powers.

The poet Ai dedicates her poem &quot;I Can&#x27;t Get Started&quot; to Hayes. He is mentioned in the poem &quot;Petroglyphs of Serena&quot; by Adrian C. Louis. Hayes was also mentioned briefly in the book &quot;Code Talker&quot; by Joseph Bruchac and was mentioned multiple times in the book &quot;Indian Killer&quot; by Sherman Alexie.

<doc id="193305" wikidata="Q407548" url="?curid=193305" title="Magnesium hydroxide">
<text>Magnesium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula Mg(OH)2. It occurs in nature as the mineral brucite. It is a white solid with low solubility in water (). Magnesium hydroxide is a common component of antacids, such as milk of magnesia.

==Preparation==
Treating the solution of different soluble magnesium salts with alkaline water induces the precipitation of the solid hydroxide Mg(OH)2:
:Mg2+ + 2 OH− → Mg(OH)2

As is the second most abundant cation present in seawater after , it can be economically extracted directly from seawater by alkalinisation as described here above. On an industrial scale, Mg(OH)2 is produced by treating seawater with lime (Ca(OH)2). A volume of of seawater gives about of Mg(OH)2. Ca(OH)2 ) is far more soluble than Mg(OH)2 ) and drastically increases the pH value of seawater from 8.2 to 12.5. The less soluble precipitates because of the common ion effect due to the added by the dissolution of :

For seawater brines, precipitating agents other than can be utilized, each with their own nuances:
* Use of can yield or , which reduces the final purity of .
* , can produce explosive nitrogen trichloride when the brine is used for chlorine production.
* as the precipitating agent has longer settling times and is difficult to filter.

It has been demonstrated that sodium hydroxide, , is the better precipitating agent compared to and due to higher recovery and purity rates, and the settling and filtration time can be improved at low temperatures and higher concentration of precipitates. Methods involving the use of precipitating agents are typically batch processes.

It is also possible to obtain from seawater using electrolysis chambers separated with a cation exchange membrane. This process is continuous, lower-cost, and produces oxygen gas, hydrogen gas, sulfuric acid (if is used; can alternatively be used to yield ), and of 98% or higher purity. It is crucial to deaerate the seawater to mitigate co-precipitation of calcium precipitates.

==Uses==
===Precursor to MgO===
Most Mg(OH)2 that is produced industrially, as well as the small amount that is mined, is converted to fused magnesia (MgO). Magnesia is valuable because it is both a poor electrical conductor and an excellent thermal conductor.

===Medical===
Only a small amount of the magnesium from magnesium hydroxide is usually absorbed by the intestine (unless one is deficient in magnesium). However, magnesium is mainly excreted by the kidneys; so long-term, daily consumption of milk of magnesia by someone suffering from kidney failure could lead in theory to hypermagnesemia. Unabsorbed magnesium is excreted in feces; absorbed magnesium is rapidly excreted in urine.
====Applications====

=====Antacid=====
As an antacid, magnesium hydroxide is dosed at approximately 0.5–1.5g in adults and works by simple neutralization, in which the hydroxide ions from the Mg(OH)2 combine with acidic H+ ions (or hydronium ions) produced in the form of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells in the stomach, to produce water.

=====Laxative=====
As a laxative, magnesium hydroxide is dosed at , and works in a number of ways. First, Mg2+ is poorly absorbed from the intestinal tract, so it draws water from the surrounding tissue by osmosis. Not only does this increase in water content soften the feces, it also increases the volume of feces in the intestine (intraluminal volume) which naturally stimulates intestinal motility. Furthermore, Mg2+ ions cause the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), which results in intraluminal accumulation of water and electrolytes, and increased intestinal motility. Some sources claim that the hydroxide ions themselves do not play a significant role in the laxative effects of milk of magnesia, as alkaline solutions (i.e., solutions of hydroxide ions) are not strongly laxative, and non-alkaline Mg2+ solutions, like MgSO4, are equally strong laxatives, mole for mole.

====History of milk of magnesia====

On May 4, 1818, American inventor Koen Burrows received a patent (No. X2952) for magnesium hydroxide. In 1829, Sir James Murray used a &quot;condensed solution of fluid magnesia&quot; preparation of his own design to treat the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Marquess of Anglesey, for stomach pain. This was so successful (advertised in Australia and approved by the Royal College of Surgeons in 1838) that he was appointed resident physician to Anglesey and two subsequent Lords Lieutenant, and knighted. His fluid magnesia product was patented two years after his death, in 1873.

The term &quot;milk of magnesia&quot; was first used by Charles Henry Phillips in 1872 for a suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8% w/v. It was sold under the brand name &quot;Phillips&#x27; Milk of Magnesia&quot; for medicinal usage.

USPTO registrations show that the terms &quot;Milk of Magnesia&quot; and &quot;Phillips&#x27; Milk of Magnesia&quot; have both been assigned to Bayer since 1995. In the UK, the non-brand (generic) name of &quot;Milk of Magnesia&quot; and &quot;Phillips&#x27; Milk of Magnesia&quot; is &quot;Cream of Magnesia&quot; (Magnesium Hydroxide Mixture, BP).

===As food additive===

It is added directly to human food, and is affirmed as generally recognized as safe by the FDA. It is known as E number E528.

Magnesium hydroxide is marketed for medical use as chewable tablets, as capsules, powder, and as liquid suspensions, sometimes flavored. These products are sold as antacids to neutralize stomach acid and relieve indigestion and heartburn. It also is a laxative to alleviate constipation. As a laxative, the osmotic force of the magnesia acts to draw fluids from the body. High doses can lead to diarrhea, and can deplete the body&#x27;s supply of potassium, sometimes leading to muscle cramps.

Some magnesium hydroxide products sold for antacid use (such as Maalox) are formulated to minimize unwanted laxative effects through the inclusion of aluminum hydroxide, which inhibits the contractions of smooth muscle cells in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby counterbalancing the contractions induced by the osmotic effects of the magnesium hydroxide.

===Other niche uses===

Magnesium hydroxide is also a component of antiperspirant.

====Waste water treatment====
Magnesium hydroxide powder is used industrially to neutralize acidic wastewaters. It is also a component of the Biorock method of building artificial reefs. The main advantage of over , is to impose a lower pH better compatible with that of seawater and sea life: pH 10.5 for in place of pH 12.5 with .

====Fire retardant====
Natural magnesium hydroxide (brucite) is used commercially as a fire retardant. Most industrially used magnesium hydroxide is produced synthetically. Like aluminum hydroxide, solid magnesium hydroxide has smoke suppressing and flame retardant properties. This property is attributable to the endothermic decomposition it undergoes at :

:Mg(OH)2 → MgO + H2O

The heat absorbed by the reaction retards the fire by delaying ignition of the associated substance. The water released dilutes combustible gases. Common uses of magnesium hydroxide as a flame retardant include additives to cable insulation, insulation plastics, roofing, and various flame retardant coatings.

==Mineralogy==

Brucite, the mineral form of Mg(OH)2 commonly found in nature also occurs in the 1:2:1 clay minerals amongst others, in chlorite, in which it occupies the interlayer position normally filled by monovalent and divalent cations such as Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+. As a consequence, chlorite interlayers are cemented by brucite and cannot swell nor shrink.

Brucite, in which some of the Mg2+ cations have been substituted by Al3+ cations, becomes positively charged and constitutes the main basis of layered double hydroxide (LDH). LDH minerals as hydrotalcite are powerful anion sorbents but are relatively rare in nature.

Brucite may also crystallize in cement and concrete in contact with seawater. Indeed, the Mg2+ cation is the second-most-abundant cation in seawater, just behind Na+ and before Ca2+. Because brucite is a swelling mineral, it causes a local volumetric expansion responsible for tensile stress in concrete. This leads to the formation of cracks and fissures in concrete, accelerating its degradation in seawater.

For the same reason, dolomite cannot be used as construction aggregate for making concrete. The reaction of magnesium carbonate with the free alkali hydroxides present in the cement porewater also leads to the formation of expansive brucite.

:MgCO3 + 2 NaOH → Mg(OH)2 + Na2CO3

This reaction, one of the two main alkali–aggregate reaction (AAR) is also known as alkali–carbonate reaction.

<text>The decade of the 1970s in film involved many significant developments in world cinema.

== Trends ==
=== Asian cinema ===

An Asian cinema touchstone beginning in the early 1970s was traditional Hong Kong martial arts films, which sparked a greater interest in Chinese martial arts around the world. Martial arts film&#x27;s popularity was elevated to a whole new level largely due to its biggest icon, Bruce Lee. He became famous for playing Kato in the television series &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; during the 1960s. When he returned to Hong Kong, Lee starred in three films that shot him to stardom all over Asia, &quot;The Big Boss&quot; (1971), &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (1972) and &quot;Way of the Dragon&quot; (1972). After the kung fu film &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot; (1972), starring Indonesian-born actor Lo Lieh, topped the North American box office in 1973, this paved the way for Lee&#x27;s &quot;The Big Boss&quot; and &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; topping the US box office. Lee achieved his greatest global stardom with his last completed film, and the first kung fu film to be produced by a Hollywood studio, &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973). This led to a &quot;chopsocky&quot; kung fu craze, while Lee&#x27;s death shortly before the film&#x27;s release resulted in a wave of &quot;Bruceploitation&quot; films in Hong Kong cinema. The latter trend eventually ended in 1978 when Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung popularized the kung fu comedy subgenre with &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot;, &quot;Enter the Fat Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Drunken Master&quot;; finally allowing the industry to move on and evolve again.

South Asian cinema of the 1970s catered to the rising working-class fantasies and struggles. In the Bollywood cinema of India, this was epitomized by the films written by Salim–Javed and starring Amitabh Bachchan. They began the genre of gritty, violent, Bombay underworld crime films in the 1970s, with films such as &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973) and &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975). These films portrayed adventurous plots and presented the young working-class man from the slums as an &quot;angry young man&quot;. The women on the other hand were shown as ones who have adopted western values and outfits especially by heroines like Parveen Babi (who was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine for a story on Bollywood&#x27;s success) and Zeenat Aman. However towards the very end of the 1970s, especially after the steep rise in land prices in urban areas and the decline in employment security, the heroines were seen more often as saree-women striving to have a prosperous middle-class family especially heroines like Jaya Prada and Hema Malini. In this way, the cinema of Asian region becomes a sociological statement of the social-economic times of the region and its people. In Malayalam cinema, Adoor Gopalakrishnan made &quot;Swayamvaram&quot; in 1972, which got wide critical acclaim. This was followed by the film &quot;Nirmalyam&quot; by M. T. Vasudevan Nair in 1973.

=== European cinema ===

In European cinema, the failure of the Prague Spring brought about nostalgic motion pictures reminiscent of the ones that celebrate the 1970s itself. These films expressed a yearning and as a premonition to the decade and its dreams. The Hungarian director István Szabó made the motion picture &quot;Szerelmesfilm&quot; (1970), which is a nostalgic portrayal and a premonition of the fading of the young 1970s ethos of change and a friendlier social structure. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci made the motion picture &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970). German films after the war asked existential questions especially the works of Rainer Fassbinder. The films of the Swedish director Ingmar Bergman reached a new level of expression in motion pictures like &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (1973). Young German directors made films that came to be known as the German new wave. It was the voice of a new generation that had grown up after the second world war. These included directors like Wim Wenders, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg and Werner Herzog.

=== North American cinema ===

The decade opened with Hollywood facing a financial slump, reflecting the monetary woes of the nation as a whole during the first half of the decade. Despite this, the 1970s proved to be a benchmark decade in the development of cinema, both as an art form and as a business. With young filmmakers taking greater risks and restrictions regarding language and sexuality lifting, New Hollywood produced some of the most critically acclaimed and financially successful films since the &quot;golden era&quot; of classical American cinema.

In the years previous to 1970, Hollywood had begun to cater to the younger generation with films such as &quot;The Graduate&quot;. This proved a folly when anti-war films like &quot;R. P. M.&quot; and &quot;The Strawberry Statement&quot; became major box-office flops. Even solid films with bankable stars, like the Pearl Harbor epic &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, flopped, leaving studios in dire straits financially. Unable to repay financiers, studios began selling off land, furniture, clothing, and sets acquired over years of production. Nostalgic fans bid on merchandise and collectibles ranging from Judy Garland&#x27;s sparkling red shoes to MGM&#x27;s own back lots.

More of the successful films were those based in the harsh truths of war, rather than the excesses of the 1960s. Films like the Francis Ford Coppola-scripted &quot;Patton&quot;, starring George C. Scott as the World War II general, and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;MASH&quot;, about a Korean War field hospital, were major box-office draws in 1970. Honest, old-fashioned films like &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot;, and the Erich Segal adaptation, &quot;Love Story&quot;, were commercial and critical hits. (Love Story and &quot;Summer&quot; remain, , two of the most successful films in Hollywood history. &quot;Summer&quot;, costing US$1,000,000, brought in $25,000,000 at the box office, while &quot;Love Story&quot;, with a budget of $2,200,000, earned $106,400,000).

One of the most insightful films of the decade came from the mind of a Hollywood outsider, Czechoslovakian director Miloš Forman, whose &quot;Taking Off&quot; became a bold reflection of life at the beginning of the 1970s. The 1971 film satirized the American middle class, following a young girl who runs away from home, leaving her parents free to explore life for the first time in years. While the film was never given a wide release in America, it became a major critical achievement both in America and around the world (garnering the film high honors at the Cannes Film Festival and several BAFTA Award nominations).

Sean Connery returned to the role of James Bond in 1971 in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; after George Lazenby filled the role in 1969. Roger Moore succeeded Connery in 1973 with an adaptation of Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; which was the most successful of his Bond films in terms of admissions. &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; was followed by an adaptation of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; in 1974, which at the time garnered the lowest box office taking of any Bond film before it. After its release Harry Saltzman co-owner of Danjaq with Albert R. Broccoli sold his half to United Artists causing a three-year gap until the next Bond film, the longest gap since the start of the franchise in 1962. The series picked up again in 1977 with &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and ended the decade with &quot;Moonraker&quot; in 1979, which was the highest grossing Bond film (not adjusting for inflation) of all time until &quot;GoldenEye&quot; in 1995.

An adaptation of an Arthur Hailey novel would prove to be one of the most notable films of 1970, and would set the stage for a major trend in 1970s cinema. The film, &quot;Airport&quot;, featured a complex plot, characters, and an all-star cast of Hollywood A-listers and legends. &quot;Airport&quot; followed an airport manager trying to keep a fictional Chicago airport operational during a blizzard, as well as a bomb plot to blow up an airplane. The film was a major critical and financial success, helping pull Universal Studios into the black for the year. The film earned senior actress Helen Hayes an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and garnered many other nominations in both technical and talent categories. The success of the film launched several other disaster films, many of which following the same blueprint of major stars, a melodramatic script, and great suspense.

Three &quot;Airport&quot; sequels followed in 1974, 1977, and 1979, each successor making less money than the last. 1972 brought &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, which starred a young Gene Hackman leading an all-star cast to safety in a capsized luxury liner. The film earned an Academy Award for visual effects (and Best Original Song for &quot;The Morning After&quot;), as well as numerous nominations, including one for its notable supporting star, Shelley Winters, but its sequel in 1979 was far less successful. &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; teamed Steve McQueen and Paul Newman against a fire in a San Francisco skyscraper. The film cost a whopping $14 million to produce (expensive for its time), and won Academy Awards for Cinematography, Film Editing, and Best Original Song. The same year, the epic &quot;Earthquake&quot; featured questionable effects (camera shake and models) to achieve a destructive 9.9 earthquake in Los Angeles. Despite this, the film was one of the most successful of its time, earning $80 million at box office. By the late 1970s, the novelty had worn off and the disasters had become less exciting. 1977 brought a terrorist targeting a &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, 1978 a &quot;Swarm&quot; of bees, and a less-than-threatening &quot;Meteor&quot; in 1979.

The early 1970s also brought a rebirth of gritty crime film, three years after the influential &quot;Bullitt&quot;. William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The French Connection&quot;, starring Gene Hackman as a drug detective and Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Serpico&quot;, starring Al Pacino in the true-life story of an honest cop who fought corruption, were two of the most famous ones. Films like &quot;Get Carter&quot; featured gratuitous nudity, while Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; featured much physical and sexual violence to complement its complex story. African American filmmakers also found success in the 1970s with such hits as &quot;Shaft&quot; and &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;. Like other sequels in the 1970s, &quot;Shaft&quot; went on to have two more adventures, each less successful than the last.

An adaptation of a Mario Puzo novel, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, was a box-office and critical success in 1972. The three-hour epic followed a Mafia boss, played by Marlon Brando, through his life of crime. Beyond the violence and drama were themes of love, pride, and greed. &quot;The Godfather&quot; went on to earn $134 million at American box office, and $245 million throughout the world, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. It won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. Its director Francis Ford Coppola was passed over in favor of Bob Fosse and his musical, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, which also earned an Oscar for its star, Liza Minnelli. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; followed in 1974, with roughly the same principal cast and crew, earning Oscars for star Robert De Niro, its director, composer, screenwriters and art directors. The film also earned the Best Picture Oscar for that year.

Not all of the &quot;street smart&quot; urban related films were 100% live action. Director Ralph Bakshi released the first animated full-length feature specifically oriented towards adults (&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;) then moved on to two other features that dealt with the mafia and other ethnic-related urban issues. Both &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; and &quot;Coonskin&quot; would prove that this kind of material could be handled effectively in the animation genre. Bakshi would later produce fantasy oriented films (&quot;Wizards&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;) before the decade ended.

Inaugurated by the 1969 release of Andy Warhol &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, the phenomenon of adult erotic films being publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope), and taken seriously by critics (like Roger Ebert), a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as &quot;porno chic&quot;, and later known as the Golden Age of Porn, began, for the first time, in modern American culture. According to award-winning author Toni Bentley, Radley Metzger 1976 film &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot;, based on the play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;), and due to attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets, is considered the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of this &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;.

In the middle 1970s, films began to also reflect the disenfranchisement brought by the excesses of the past twenty years. A deeply unsettling look at alienation and city life, Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; earned international praise, first at the Cannes Film Festival and then at the Academy Awards, where it was nominated for Best Leading Actor (Robert De Niro), Best Supporting Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Score (Bernard Herrmann), and Best Picture. &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; dealt with the impeachment of Richard Nixon, while Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Network&quot; portrayed greed and narcissism in both American society and television media. The film won Oscars for Best Actor (Peter Finch), Best Actress (Faye Dunaway), Best Supporting Actress (Beatrice Straight), and Best Screenplay (Paddy Chayefsky). Thanks to a stellar cast, experienced director, and a poignant story, &quot;Network&quot; became one of the largest critical successes of 1976. Another film, &quot;Rocky&quot;, about a clubhouse boxer (played by Sylvester Stallone) who is granted a world championship title fight won the Best Picture Academy Award that year. The film also became a major commercial success and spawned four sequels through the rest of the 1970s and 1980s.

Throughout the 1970s, the horror film developed into a lucrative genre of film. It began in 1973 with the terrifying &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, directed by William Friedkin and starring the young Linda Blair. The film saw massive success, and the first of several sequels was released in 1977. 1976 brought the equally creepy suspense thriller, &quot;Marathon Man&quot;, about a man who becomes the target of a former Nazi dentist&#x27;s torment after his brother dies. The same year, the Devil himself made an appearance in &quot;The Omen&quot;, about the spawn of Satan. 1978&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; was a precursor to the &quot;slasher&quot; films of the 1980s and 1990s with its psychopathic Michael Myers. Cult horror films were also popular in the 1970s, such as Wes Craven&#x27;s early gore films &quot;Last House on the Left&quot; and &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot;, as well as Tobe Hooper&#x27;s &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;.

The blockbuster was born in 1975. While &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was among the top five grossing films of the 1970s, the first film given the blockbuster distinction was 1975&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;. Released on June 20, the film about a series of horrific deaths related to a massive great white shark was director Steven Spielberg&#x27;s first big-budget Hollywood production, coming in at $9 million in cost. The film slowly grew in ticket sales and became one of the most profitable films of its time, ending with a $260 million gross in the United States alone. The film won Academy Awards for its skillful editing, chilling score, and sound recording. It was also nominated for Best Picture that year, though it lost to Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (which also won acting awards for Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher). It spawned the successful sequel, &quot;Jaws 2&quot; in 1978, which featured the same cast, but without Steven Spielberg. Another tailor-made blockbuster, Dino De Laurentiis&#x27; &quot;King Kong&quot; was released, but to less than stellar success. &quot;King Kong&quot; did mark the first time a film was booked to theaters before a release date, a common practice today.

The massive success of &quot;Jaws&quot; was eclipsed just two years later by another legendary blockbuster and film franchise. The George Lucas science-fiction film &quot;Star Wars&quot; hit theater screens in May 1977, and became a major hit, growing in ticket sales throughout the summer and the rest of the year. In time earning some $460 million, the good versus evil fantasy set in space was not soon surpassed. The film&#x27;s breathtaking visual effects won an Academy Award. The film also won for John Williams&#x27;s uplifting score, as well as art direction, costume design, film editing, and sound. &quot;Star Wars&quot; effectively removed any specter of studio bankruptcy that had haunted the studios since early in the decade. When a television film, &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;, was released as a spin-off from &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1978; it failed to receive the status of the original film, and was deemed a flop. It would be two years until the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series would be revived with &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Another success in visual effects came the same year as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, with Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, another blockbuster and alien contact set in the wilderness. For the picture, Spielberg received his first Oscar nomination for directing. A year later the most iconic superhero was brought to the screen in &quot;Superman&quot;, who was portrayed by classically trained actor Christopher Reeve. It was met by resounding praise for strong performances and its epic scope which resulted in numerous sequels and is regarded as one of the greatest superhero films ever made, beginning a new era of superhero films.

The success of Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Annie Hall&quot; in 1977 stirred a new trend in filmmaking. &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, a love story about a depressed comedian and a free-spirited woman, was followed with more sentimental films, including Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot; starring Jill Clayburgh, the autobiographical Lillian Hellman story, &quot;Julia&quot;, starring Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave, and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; and &quot;International Velvet&quot;.

Younger audiences were also beginning to be the focus of cinema, after the huge blockbusters that had attracted them back to the theater. John Travolta became popular in the pop-culture landmark films, &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, which introduced Disco to middle America, and &quot;Grease&quot;, which recalled the world of the 1950s. Comedy was also given new life in the irreverent &quot;Animal House&quot;, set on a college campus during the 1960s. &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;, starring Cheech &amp; Chong, was another irreverent comedy about marijuana use became popular among teenagers. The new television comedy program, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, launched the careers of several of its comedians, such as Chevy Chase, who co-starred in the 1978 hit &quot;Foul Play&quot; with Goldie Hawn.

The decade closed with two films chronicling the Vietnam War, Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. Both films focused on the horrors of war and the psychological damage caused by such horrors. Christopher Walken and director Michael Cimino earned Oscars for their work on the film, which earned a Best Picture Academy Award. Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep were also nominated for their work in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; won for cinematography and sound, and earned nominations for Robert Duvall and Coppola. Hal Ashby&#x27;s &quot;Coming Home&quot; portrayed life for Vietnam veterans. Actor Jon Voight won an Academy Award for his role in the film. In this decade there was also an emergence of B-movies featuring Vietnam veterans with an emphasis on action, violence, and revenge, which belong to the exploitation subgenre called &quot;vetsploitation.&quot;

1979 saw the poignant &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;, the inspiring &quot;Norma Rae&quot;, and the nuclear thriller, &quot;The China Syndrome&quot;. &quot;Alien&quot; scared summer film-going audiences of 1979 with its horrible monster from outer space, achieving similar success that Jaws had seen four years earlier. Meanwhile, &quot;The Onion Field&quot; and &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; focused on the failures of the American judicial system. The year ended with Hal Ashby&#x27;s subtle black comedy &quot;Being There&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, a family film based on the Jim Henson puppet characters.

<text>A private railway is a railroad run by a private business entity (usually a corporation but not need be), as opposed to a railroad run by a public sector.

==Japan==
In Japan, , commonly simply &quot;private railway&quot;, refers to a public transit railway owned and operated by private sector, almost always organized as a joint-stock company, or in Japanese: kabushiki gaisha (lit. stock company), but may be any type of private business entity. Although the Japan Railways Group (JR Group) companies are also kabushiki gaishas, they are not classified as private railways because of their unique status as the primary successors of the Japanese National Railways (JNR). Voluntary sector railways (semi-public) are additionally not classified as &quot;shitetsu&quot; due to their origins as rural, money-losing JNR lines that have since been transferred to local possession, in spite of their organizational structures being corporatized.

Among &quot;private railways&quot; in Japan, the categorizes 16 companies as &quot;major&quot; operators. They are often profitable and tend to be less expensive per passenger-kilometer than JR trains that also run less dense regional routes. Private railways corporations in Japan also run and generate profits from a variety of other businesses that depend on the traffic generated through their transit systems: hotels, department stores, supermarkets, resorts, and real estate development and leasing.

Japanese railways, whether government run, semi-public, or private business, are subject to the regulations enforced by the of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. They may join unions such as National Railway Workers&#x27; Union and General Federation of Private Railway and Bus Workers&#x27; Unions of Japan, but their abilities to call a strike is severely limited by government legislation; there is very little tolerance for railway work stoppage. Employees of private railways may legally strike but its unheard of in Japan. There have only been two notable railroad strikes in Japanese history, both by employees of government run entities (government employees are legally barred from striking): One in 1973, and a major strike protesting the breakup (and layoffs of tens of thousands of employees) of JNR in 1985.

Though &quot;private railways&quot; such as industrial railways have existed in Japan they are not deemed &quot;shitetsu&quot; nor &quot;mintetsu&quot; in Japanese, as their purpose is not public transit.

Tokyo Metro is a member of Japan Private Railway Association but is under special laws and its stock is owned by the Japanese Government and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (pending privatization). The Japan Private Railway Association counts Tokyo Metro as one of the 16 major private railways.

==United States==

In the United States, a private railroad is a railroad owned by a company and serves only that company, and does not hold itself out as a &quot;common carrier&quot; (i.e., it does not provide rail transport services for the general public).

<doc id="193308" wikidata="Q193502" url="?curid=193308" title="Cryolite">
<text>Cryolite (Na3AlF6, sodium hexafluoroaluminate) is a rare mineral identified with the once-large deposit at Ivittuut on the west coast of Greenland, mined commercially until 1987.

It is used in the reduction (&quot;smelting&quot;) of aluminium, in pest control, and as a dye.

==History==
Cryolite was first described in 1798 by Danish veterinarian and physician (1740–1801), from rock samples obtained from local Inuit who used the mineral for washing their hides; the actual source of the ore was later discovered in 1806 by the explorer Karl Ludwig Giesecke. who found the deposit at Ivigtut (old spelling) and nearby Arsuk Fjord, Southwest Greenland, where it was extracted by Øresund Chemical Industries. The name is derived from the Greek words (), and ().

The Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company used large amounts of cryolite to make caustic soda and fluorine compounds, including hydrofluoric acid at its Natrona, Pennsylvania, works, and at its integrated chemical plant in Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania, during the 19th and 20th centuries.

It was historically used as an ore of aluminium and later in the electrolytic processing of the aluminium-rich oxide ore bauxite (itself a combination of aluminium oxide minerals such as gibbsite, boehmite and diaspore). The difficulty of separating aluminium from oxygen in the oxide ores was overcome by the use of cryolite as a flux to dissolve the oxide mineral(s). Pure cryolite itself melts at 1012 °C (1285 K), and it can dissolve the aluminium oxides sufficiently well to allow easy extraction of the aluminium by electrolysis. Substantial energy is still needed for both heating the materials and the electrolysis, but it is much more energy-efficient than melting the oxides themselves. As natural cryolite is now too rare to be used for this purpose, synthetic sodium aluminium fluoride is produced from the common mineral fluorite.

In 1940 before entering World War II, the United States became involved with protecting the world&#x27;s largest cryolite mine in Ivittuut, Greenland from falling into Nazi Germany&#x27;s control.

==Source locations==

Besides Ivittuut, on the west coast of Greenland where cryolite was once found in commercial quantities, small deposits of cryolite have also been reported in some areas of Spain, at the foot of Pikes Peak in Colorado, Francon Quarry near Montreal in Quebec, Canada and also in Miask, Russia.

==Uses==
Molten cryolite is used as a solvent for aluminium oxide (Al2O3) in the Hall–Héroult process, used in the refining of aluminium. It decreases the melting point of aluminium oxide from 2000–2500 °C to 900–1000 °C, and increases its conductivity thus making the extraction of aluminium more economical.

Cryolite is used as an insecticide and a pesticide. It is also used to give fireworks a yellow color.
It is used in glass manufacturing as a &quot;powerful opaliser.&quot;

==Physical properties==

Cryolite occurs as glassy, colorless, white-reddish to gray-black prismatic monoclinic crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and a specific gravity of about 2.95 to 3.0. It is translucent to transparent with a very low refractive index of about 1.34, which is very close to that of water; thus if immersed in water, cryolite becomes essentially invisible.

<doc id="193310" wikidata="Q2089240" url="?curid=193310" title="Oatmeal">
<text>Oatmeal is a preparation of oats that have been de-husked, steamed, and flattened, or a coarse flour of hulled oat grains (groats) that have either been milled (ground), rolled, or steel-cut. Ground oats are also called white oats. Steel-cut oats are known as coarse oatmeal, Irish oatmeal, or pinhead oats. Rolled oats were traditionally thick old-fashioned oats, but they can be made thinner or smaller and may be categorized as quick oatmeal or instant oatmeal depending on the cooking time required, which is determined by the size of the oats and the amount of precooking. 

==Industrial preparation and varieties==

The oat grains are de-husked by impact, and are then heated and cooled to stabilize the groats, the seed inside the husk. The groats may be milled to produce fine, medium, or coarse oatmeal.

Rolled oats are oats that have been steamed, flattened by a &quot;flaking roller&quot;, and dried. Old-fashioned oats are made from whole oat groats and may be thick and require longer cooking time. Quick-cooking rolled oats are made from steel-cut oats and rolled somewhat thinner. Instant oatmeal is made from more finely cut oats and rolled even thinner, often with a sweetener and flavorings added.

==Food uses==

Both types of rolled oats may be eaten uncooked, as in muesli, or cooked with water or milk to make porridge. In some countries, rolled oats are eaten raw or toasted with milk and sugar, sometimes with raisins added, as in muesli. The term &quot;oatmeal&quot; sometimes refers to a porridge made from the bran or fibrous husk as well as from the kernel or groat. Rolled oats are often used as a key ingredient in granola, in which toasted oats are blended with sugar and/or nuts and raisins, and in granola bars.

Rolled oats are also used as an ingredient in oatmeal cookies, oatcakes, British flapjack bars, and baked oatmeal dessert dishes such as apple Brown Betty and apple crisp. Oats may also be added to foods as an accent, as in the topping on many oat bran breads and as the coating on Caboc cheese. Oatmeal is also used as a thickening agent in savory Arabic or Egyptian meat-and-vegetable soups, and sometimes as a way of adding relatively low-cost fibre and nutritional content to meatloaf.

===Nutrition===

Unenriched oatmeal, cooked by boiling or microwaving, is 84% water and contains 12% carbohydrates, including 2% dietary fiber, and 2% each of protein and fat (table). In a 100-gram amount, a serving of cooked oatmeal provides 71 Calories and contains 29% of the Daily Value (DV) for manganese and moderate content of phosphorus and zinc (11% DV each), with no other micronutrients in a significant quantity (see table on right).

===Health effects===

Oatmeal and other oat products were the subject of a 1997 ruling by the Food and Drug Administration that consuming oat bran or whole rolled oats can lower the risk of heart disease when combined with a low-fat diet via the effect of oat beta-glucan to reduce levels of blood cholesterol. A similar conclusion was reached in 2010 by the European Food Safety Authority.

A 2023 review found oat consumption can significantly lower blood pressure.

==Regional variations==
===Ireland===
In Ireland, stirabout () was formerly a staple food, made by stirring oatmeal into boiling water or milk to form a thin soup. It could be flavoured with cream, sugar, butter, salt, honey, seeds or fruit on top.

Because of its cheapness, and the ease with which it could be prepared in large quantities, stirabout was widely served in institutions like prisons, boarding schools, convents, and workhouses. For example, in 1863, children in workhouses received stirabout for their breakfast: made of half oats and half cornmeal, each child got of meal and of milk. Similarly, in 1891, district asylum inmates got of meal in stirabout every morning. Similarly, in the 20th century, prisoners got between and of stirabout for breakfast in many Irish jails.

===Scotland===
Oatmeal has a long history in Scottish culinary tradition because oats are better suited than wheat to the country&#x27;s low temperatures and high humidity. As a result, oats became the staple grain of Scotland. The ancient universities of Scotland had a holiday called Meal Monday to permit students to return to their farms and collect more oats for food.

Samuel Johnson referred, disparagingly, to this in his dictionary definition for oats: &quot;A grain, which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people.&quot; His biographer, James Boswell, noted that Lord Elibank was said by Sir Walter Scott to have retorted, &quot;Yes, and where else will you see such horses and such men?&quot;

In Scotland, oatmeal is created by grinding oats into a coarse powder. It may be ground fine, medium, or coarse, or rolled, or the groats may be chopped in two or three pieces to make what is described as pinhead oatmeal. Ground oatmeal, rolled oats, and pinhead oatmeal are all used throughout Britain; one Scots manufacturer describes varieties as &quot;Scottish Porridge Oats&quot; (rolled), &quot;Scottish Oatmeal&quot; (medium ground), and &quot;Pinhead Oatmeal&quot;. The main uses are:
* Traditional porridge
* Brose: a thick mixture made with uncooked oatmeal (or medium oatmeal that has been dry toasted by stirring it around in a dry pot over heat until it turns a slightly darker shade and emits a sweet, nutty fragrance) and then adding butter or cream. Quick-cooking rolled oats (distinct from &quot;instant&quot; variations) are often used for this purpose nowadays because they are quicker to prepare.
* Gruel, made by mixing oatmeal with cold water that is strained and heated for the benefit of infants and people recovering from illness.
* as an ingredient in baking
* in the manufacture of bannocks or oatcakes
* as a stuffing for poultry
* as a coating for Caboc cheese
* as the main ingredient of the Scottish dish skirlie, or its chip-shop counterpart, the deep-fried thickly-battered mealy pudding
* mixed with sheep&#x27;s blood, salt, and pepper to make Highland black pudding ().
* mixed with fat, water, onions, and seasoning, and boiled in a sheep&#x27;s intestine to make &quot;,&quot; Outer Hebridean white pudding, served sliced with fried eggs at breakfast. A sweeter version with dried fruit is also known.
* as a major component of haggis.
* in &quot;sowans,&quot; not strictly made from the meal but as a porridge-like dish made from the fermented inner husks of oats

===Staffordshire===
Staffordshire oatcakes are a local component of the full English breakfast. It is a plate-sized pancake, made with medium oatmeal and wheatmeal (flour), along with yeast. Once the mixture has risen, it is ladled onto a griddle or bakestone and dried through. Staffordshire oatcakes are commonly paired with bacon, sausages, mushrooms, kidney, and baked beans, among others. A related oatcake is sometimes found in neighbouring Derbyshire.

===The Netherlands, the Nordic countries, the Baltics and Russia===
Throughout the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, the Baltic states and Russia, oatmeal porridge made from rolled oats and water or milk is a traditional breakfast staple. Known under various local names meaning , or , it is normally made either savoury or sweet by adding salt or sugar, and it is often eaten with added nuts, raisins or dried fruits as well as spices, most commonly cinnamon. Local names for the porridge include Dutch , Swedish , Danish , Norwegian or , Icelandic , Finnish , Estonian , Latvian , Lithuanian , Polish and Russian ().

Oatmeal porridge has a long tradition in these regions, but during the Middle Ages porridge made from rye or barley was even more common in at least some parts of the area.

===United States===
In the United States, oatmeal is often served as a porridge with milk or cream and a sweetener, such as brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup. The term &quot;oatmeal&quot; is used in American English to mean porridge. It may include additional ingredients such as peanut butter, cinnamon, or various types of fruits.

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, a common oatmeal dish known as zimbuleh is eaten during the winter months. Traditionally it is sweetened with raw honey and cardamom. In the Eket and Kwa Ibo regions it is often served alongside warm milk, and it is customary to pour the milk into the porridge just moments before eating.

<doc id="193316" wikidata="Q1193472" url="?curid=193316" title="Mr. Krabs">
<text>Eugene Harold Krabs, better known as simply Mr. Krabs, is a fictional character in the American animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. He is voiced by actor Clancy Brown and first appeared in the series&#x27; pilot episode &quot;Help Wanted&quot; on May 1, 1999. The character was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg.

Krabs owns and operates the Krusty Krab, a prominent fast food restaurant located in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. He resides in a hollow anchor with his daughter Pearl, who is a teenage sperm whale. Krabs is miserly obsessed with money and dislikes spending it, but will go to great lengths to make Pearl happy. He tends to worry about his riches and neglects the needs of his employees, SpongeBob and Squidward. He is in a romantic relationship with Mrs. Puff and shares a rivalry with his former best friend Plankton, who owns a struggling restaurant called the Chum Bucket located across the street from the Krusty Krab.

Critical reception for Mr. Krabs was positive upon the series&#x27; debut but has been mixed as the show progressed. Critics have offered praise toward his portrayal as a single father to Pearl but criticized a perceived exaggeration of his greed throughout the series&#x27; run. The character has been featured in a variety of merchandise, including plush toys, collectible figures, and video games. He also appears in the three &quot;SpongeBob&quot; films.

==Role in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;==
Mr. Krabs is commonly known as the greedy founder and owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, where SpongeBob works as a fry cook and Squidward works as a cashier. The restaurant&#x27;s success is built on little competition and the popularity of the Krusty Krab&#x27;s signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade secret. Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant&#x27;s popularity, engaging in price gouging and charging his own employees for use of the building&#x27;s services.

Krabs&#x27; rival and former best friend Plankton operates the Chum Bucket, an unsuccessful restaurant across the street from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton failing to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer wife, Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business whatsoever.

Krabs values money more than his own well-being and assesses the other characters based on their financial value to him. The only exceptions are Pearl and his girlfriend Mrs. Puff. His love for Mrs. Puff is so strong that it temporarily transcends his greed and drives him to buy her expensive gifts. Krabs tolerates his two employees because they work for little pay and because of their positive impact on his finances, but he is quick to rebuke them if they engage in behavior that drives away customers. Krabs has a tentative father-son relationship with SpongeBob; Krabs often scolds him if he gets in trouble, but at times gives him fatherlike advice. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt has stated that this Krabs-SpongeBob dynamic is his favorite part of the show, telling &quot;Digital Spy&quot; in 2011 that &quot;the aspect of SpongeBob I love the most is his undying loyalty to Mr. Krabs. No matter how Mr. Krabs treats him. I try to replicate that in my own life in every way.&quot;

==Character==
===Development===

Mr. Krabs is the only character in &quot;SpongeBob&quot; initially based on a specific person from Stephen Hillenburg&#x27;s life. When designing Mr. Krabs, Hillenburg drew inspiration from his former manager at a seafood restaurant. According to Hillenburg, his manager was redheaded, muscular, and a former army cook; these three traits were adapted into Krabs&#x27; character, with Krabs&#x27; red color standing in for hair. Krabs&#x27; speaking manner was also inspired by the restaurant owner, who reminded Hillenburg of a pirate with his strong Maine accent. However, the owner was not greedy, with this detail added by Hillenburg to &quot;give him more personality.&quot;

When Hillenburg first created Mr. Krabs, his and Pearl&#x27;s surname was spelled with a C rather than a K. Thus, the name of Krabs&#x27; restaurant was the &quot;Crusty Crab.&quot; Hillenburg changed the name shortly before production began on the show&#x27;s pilot episode, deciding that K&#x27;s were funnier and more memorable. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production on the first season had started. The original map of the show&#x27;s setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both of the characters&#x27; residence.

Mr. Krabs has a distinct manner of walking; when he moves, he moves his feet very quickly and he is drawn as if he has more than two legs. When directing animation for early episodes, one of Hillenburg&#x27;s goals was for each character to have a separate walk cycle that showed their personalities; storyboard artist Erik Wiese designed Krabs&#x27; walk cycle with the intention of making it cartoonish. Wiese recalled in 2012, &quot;I animated Mr. Krabs&#x27; little feet on a four-frame multi-blur cycle—I think it was the best solution to making him walk like a crab.&quot; Hillenburg approved of the walk after Wiese demonstrated it on a pencil test machine.

===Voice===

Mr. Krabs&#x27; voice is provided by American actor Clancy Brown. Brown describes the voice he uses for the character as &quot;piratey,&quot; with &quot;a little Scottish brogue.&quot; According to Brown, Krabs&#x27; voice was improvised during his audition and it was not challenging for him to find the correct voice. Brown is fond of playing the role, having told the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 2015, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind doing [the voice] until the end of time. There&#x27;s just no corollary in live-action work—television or films or anything—to playing a miserly crab on the bottom of the ocean.&quot;

In a 2005 interview with the magazine &quot;Starlog&quot;, Brown described his work on &quot;SpongeBob&quot; as a &quot;whole other career&quot; compared to his live action roles. Brown&#x27;s other acting projects have brought some guest actors onto &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, including Dennis Quaid, whose work with Brown on &quot;The Express: The Ernie Davis Story&quot; led to his selection as a guest star for the episode &quot;Grandpappy the Pirate.&quot;

==Reception==
Critical reception for Mr. Krabs has been mixed, with most criticism directed at his parsimony and the lack of realistic consequences he faces for it. In 2014, Spanish professor Pancracio Celdrán criticized the positive portrayal of Mr. Krabs&#x27; stinginess in front of young audiences. Economist Sarah Newcomb described Mr. Krabs as a negative stereotype, writing in the Wiley book &quot;Loaded&quot; that &quot;King Midas, Ebenezer Scrooge, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Krabs are the same recycled character, representing the person who cares for money above all.&quot;

Polish scholar Barbara Czarniawska disliked the heroic portrayal of Mr. Krabs in the second &quot;SpongeBob&quot; film, despite being &quot;a ruthless capitalist who exploits his customers and his workers alike.&quot; She later criticized how the show seemingly normalized the character&#x27;s use of &quot;legal forms of manipulation and exploitative power relations in business.&quot; Conversely, political activist Howie Klein of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; offered a more positive interpretation of the character, saying in 2006 that Mr. Krabs is not &quot;exactly an evil villain; he&#x27;s just a greed-obsessed Republican type.&quot; Klein interviewed SpongeBob&#x27;s voice actor Tom Kenny on the topic; Kenny compared Krabs to oil businessman Erle P. Halliburton, then called the character a comedic representation of &quot;unchecked, unthinking, unregulated capitalism. Everything [to Krabs] is about the bottom line, not about what&#x27;s socially responsible.&quot;

In his 2011 book &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy&quot;, political scientist Joseph J. Foy discusses Krabs&#x27; antagonistic side over several chapters. Foy argues that Krabs, not Plankton and Karen, is the true evil character in the series. He also notes his problem with Mr. Krabs&#x27; character that &quot;Krabs never seems to learn from the suffering he undergoes, or from witnessing the pain and struggles he inflicts on others.&quot;

In an article for &quot;Complex&quot;, Debbie Encalada praised the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; series as a whole for challenging social norms; Mr. Krabs&#x27; portrayal as a single father to Pearl was specifically highlighted as an example of the show&#x27;s &quot;subversiveness by subtly challenging the idea of the nuclear family.&quot; &quot;Newsday&quot;″s Meghan Giannotta wrote positively of the character in a 2016 article: &quot;Mr. Krabs ... may be known for being cheap, but he&#x27;s also determined and a good friend and father. He&#x27;ll do whatever it takes to make his daughter Pearl happy and he goes to extreme measures to help protect his fast-food business.&quot; In a review of the season four episode &quot;Have You Seen This Snail?,&quot; television critic Tom Shales described Krabs as &quot;good-natured&quot; and as one of &quot;the things people love about &quot;SpongeBob.&quot;&quot; Paul Mavis of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; named the Krabs-centric episode &quot;Krusty Krab Training Video&quot; one of the series&#x27; best, calling its humorous portrayal of Mr. Krabs&#x27; backstory the highlight.

Basketball player LeBron James has stated that if he &quot;could be any character on the show, [he] would be Mr. Krabs.&quot; Cartoonist Michael Cavna commented on James&#x27; high opinion of Krabs, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he found it intriguing how &quot;the gazillionaire NBA hoopster cites his respect for ... the show&#x27;s resident tightwad.&quot; Mr. Krabs is also the favorite &quot;SpongeBob&quot; character of football running back Cedric Benson.

==In other media==

Mr. Krabs has been featured in various merchandise such as plush toys, video games, comics, and trading cards. The Krabs family restaurant, the Krusty Krab, has been the basis for a Lego playset and many replicas at attractions. A float modeled after the Krusty Krab, featuring a costumed mascot of Pearl that greeted guests and an animatronic Mr. Krabs, regularly appeared at Sea World&#x27;s weekly &quot;SpongeBob ParadePants&quot; parade. A full-size replica of the building was built in Ramallah, Palestine in 2014. In January 2016, Nickelodeon&#x27;s parent company Viacom filed a lawsuit against the operators of a similar for-profit &quot;Krusty Krab&quot; restaurant set to open in Texas. A Texas federal judge ruled in January 2017 that the planned restaurant violated Viacom&#x27;s rights to the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; property, thus halting its construction.

In 2011, the indie rock group Yo La Tengo performed a live version of the Krusty Krab commercial from the episode &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; at El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Included as part of Yo La Tengo&#x27;s first tour, it starred Ira Kaplan as Mr. Krabs. Billy Gil of &quot;L.A. Record&quot; praised the performance as a whole and called Kaplan&#x27;s impression &quot;dead-on.&quot; An episode of the sketch comedy series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; titled &quot;Major League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; includes a skit that stars Mr. Krabs and Pearl. The segment, animated in stop motion like most other sketches on the program, features Mr. Krabs using crab legs as the secret ingredient for Krabby Patties.

A track on &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;, a 2006 soundtrack album, titled &quot;Fishin&#x27; for Money&quot; features the vocal performance of Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs. In the 2017 Broadway musical based on &quot;SpongeBob&quot;, Krabs, played by Brian Ray Norris, sings a duet with Pearl titled &quot;Daddy Knows Best,&quot; an original composition written by Alex Ebert that highlights the characters&#x27; differences. In his pre-Broadway review of the musical, &quot;Variety&quot;″s Steven Oxman asserted that the musical&#x27;s version of Mr. Krabs &quot;fall[s] flat&quot; compared to his animated counterpart, and that the theatrical adaptation &quot;finds no humor or wit or even edge in Mr. Krabs&#x27; obsession with money, nor in the nonsensical element that his daughter is a whale.&quot;

<text>The music of Brazil encompasses various regional musical styles influenced by European, American, African and Amerindian forms. Brazilian music developed some unique and original styles such as forró, axé, sertanejo, samba, bossa nova, MPB, gaucho music, pagode, tropicália, choro, maracatu, frevo, brega, modinha, capoeira, and Brazilian versions of foreign musical styles, such as rock, pop music, soul, hip-hop, disco music, country music, ambient, industrial and psychedelic music, rap, classical music, fado, and gospel.

The first four winners of the Shell Brazilian Music prize have each left a legacy on Brazilian music and are among the representatives of Brazilian popular music: Pixinguinha (choro), Antônio Carlos Jobim (bossa nova), Dorival Caymmi (samba and samba-canção), and Luiz Gonzaga (forró).
== History ==
=== Art music ===
==== Origins ====
Little is known of the music of Brazil before the area&#x27;s first encounter with Portuguese explorers on 22 April 1500. During the colonial period, documents detail the musical activities of the major Roman Catholic cathedrals and the parlors of the upper classes, but data about musical life outside these domains are sparse. Some information is available in writings left by such travellers as Jean de Léry, who lived in Brazil from 1557 to 1558 and produced the first known transcriptions of native American music: two chants of the Tupinambá, near Rio de Janeiro.

Further registration of musical activity in Brazil came from the activities of two Jesuit priests in 1549. Ten years later, they had already founded settlements for indigenous people (the &quot;Reduções&quot;), with a musical-educational structure.

One century later, the Reduções of the southern Brazil, which were founded by Spaniard Jesuits, had a strong cultural development, where some music schools were founded. Some of the reports of that time show the fascination of the indigenous people for European music.

==== The 18th-century school ====

In the 18th century, there was intense musical activity in all the more developed regions of Brazil, with their moderately stable institutional and educational structures. The previously few private orchestras became more common and the churches presented a great variety of music.

In the first half of this century, the most outstanding works were composed by Luís Álvares Pinto, Caetano de Mello de Jesus and Antônio José da Silva (&quot;the Jew&quot;), who became successful in Lisbon writing librettos for comedies, which were performed also in Brazil with music by António Teixeira.

In the second part of the 18th century, there was a great flourishing in Minas Gerais, mostly in the regions of &quot;Vila Rica&quot; (currently Ouro Preto), Mariana and &quot;Arraial do Tejuco&quot; (currently Diamantina), where the mining of gold and diamonds for the Portuguese metropolis attracted a sizable population. At this time, the first outstanding Brazilian composers were revealed, most of them mulattoes. The musical pieces were mostly sacred music. Some of the noteworthy composers of this period were Lobo de Mesquita, Manoel Dias de Oliveira, Francisco Gomes da Rocha, Marcos Coelho Neto and Marcos Coelho Neto Filho. All of them were very active, but in many cases few pieces have survived until the present day. Some of the most famous pieces of this period are the &quot;Magnificat&quot; by Manoel Dias de Oliveira and the &quot;Our Lady&#x27;s Antiphon&quot; by Lobo de Mesquita. In the city of Arraial do Tejuco, nowadays Diamantina, there were ten conductors in activity. In Ouro Preto about 250 musicians were active, and in all of the territory of Minas Gerais almost a thousand musicians were active.

==== The Classical period ====
A important composer of this period is Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade, who composed the only Brazilian chamber music from the 19th century which has survived to the present times,

==== Nationalism ====

In the beginning of the 20th century, there was a movement for creating an authentically Brazilian music, with less influences of the European culture. In this sense, the folklore was the major font of inspiration for the composers. Some composers like Brasílio Itiberê da Cunha, Luciano Gallet and Alexandre Levy, despite having a European formation, included some typically Brazilian elements in their works. This trend reached the highest point with Alberto Nepomuceno, who used largely the rhythms and melodies from the Brazilian folklore. There were local cultural movements to consolidate regional identities through music as for example, José Brazilício de Souza, who wrote the state anthem of Santa Catarina and his son Álvaro Sousa, who was a noticeable musician, music educator, and composer there.

== Indigenous and folk music ==

The native peoples of the Brazilian rainforest play instruments including whistles, flutes, horns, drums and rattles. Much of the area&#x27;s folk music imitates the sounds of the Amazon Rainforest. When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, the first natives they met played an array of reed flutes and other wind and percussion instruments.

The Jesuit missionaries introduced songs which used the Tupi language with Christian lyrics, an attempt to convert the people to Christianity.

== Popular music ==

=== Choro ===


&quot;Choro&quot; (literally &quot;cry&quot; in Portuguese, but in context a more appropriate translation would be &quot;lament&quot;), traditionally called &quot;chorinho&quot; (&quot;little cry&quot; or &quot;little lament&quot;). Instrumental, its origins are in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Originally &quot;choro&quot; was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). The young pianist Ernesto Nazareth published his first choro (&quot;Não Caio Noutra&quot;) in 1878 at the age of 14. Nazareth&#x27;s choros are often listed as &quot;polkas&quot;; he also composed waltzes, schottisches, milongas and Brazilian Tangos. (He resisted the popular term &quot;maxixe&quot; to represent Brazilian tango.) Chiquinha Gonzaga was another important composer of choros and started shortly after Nazareth. Chiquinha Gonzaga composed her first success, the polka-choro &quot;Atraente&quot;, in 1877. In the beginning, the success of choro came from informal groups of friends which played in parties, pubs (botecos), streets, home balls (forrobodós), and also the musical scores published by print houses.

=== Samba ===
In 1929, prompted by the opening of the first radio station in Rio de Janeiro, the so-called &quot;radio era&quot; began spreading songs – especially the novelty Samba in its current format – to larger masses. This period was dominated by few male interpreters – notably Almirante, Braguinha, Mário Reis, Sílvio Caldas, Francisco Alves and singer/composer Noel Rosa and even fewer chanteuses such as Aracy de Almeida and sisters Aurora Miranda and Carmen Miranda, who eventually came to Hollywood becoming a movie star.


=== MPB (Popular Brazilian Music) ===

MPB&#x27;s early stage (from World War II to the mid-1960s) was populated by male singers such as Orlando Silva, Nelson Gonçalves, Jamelão, Agostinho dos Santos, Anísio Silva, Ataulfo Alves, Carlos Galhardo, Ciro Monteiro, Ismael Silva, João Dias, Jorge Goulart, Miltinho, Jorge Veiga and Francisco Egídio and female singers started to mushroom: Nora Ney, Dolores Duran, Ângela Maria, Emilinha Borba, Marlene, Dalva de Oliveira, Maysa Matarazzo, sisters Linda Batista and Dircinha Batista, among others.

=== Brega music ===

Brega is widely used to refer to popular romantic music with dramatic exaggeration or ingenuity, usually dealing with topics such as declarations of love, infidelity and love delusions. Historically, the greatest singers of the genre are from northeastern and northern Brazil; three of its biggest icons historically were Waldick Soriano, Reginaldo Rossi and Falcão, the latter following a part of a tradition of humorous brega. Paulo Sérgio stood out for his dramatic and romantic music. some precursors of the style in singers of the 1940s and 1950s, who followed, through bolero and samba-canção, a more &quot;romantic&quot; theme. Among them Orlando Dias, Carlos Alberto, Alcides Gerardi and Cauby Peixoto.&lt;ref name=&quot;DicionarioMPB/BREGA&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Axé ===

Axé originated in Salvador, Bahia in the 1980s, fusing different Afro-Caribbean genres, such as marcha, reggae, and calypso. It also includes influences of Brazilian music such as frevo, forró and carixada. The word Axé comes from the Yoruba term &quot;àṣẹ&quot;, meaning &quot;soul, light, spirit or good vibrations&quot;. Axé is also present in the Candomblé religion, as &quot;the imagined spiritual power and energy bestowed upon practitioners by the pantheon of orixás&quot;. It also has ties with the Roman Catholic Church and the Lenten season, which represents the roots of Bahian Carnival.

=== Brazilian gospel ===

Gospel music emerged in Brazil before the 1960s with hymnals that were brought and translated into Portuguese by American missionaries. From the late 1960s the first singers of Christian music groups emerged in Brazil, but the songs were not highly valued. Gospel music became popular in Brazil in the late 1990s, with the emergence of congregational singing and bands such as Diante do Trono, led by Ana Paula Valadão. Diante do Trono has become the largest contemporary worship music ministry in Latin America.

=== Brazilian rock ===
The musical style known in Brazil as &quot;Brazilian rock n&#x27; roll&quot; dates back to Nora Ney&#x27;s &quot;Ronda Das Horas&quot;, a Portuguese version of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in 1954. The band Pato Fu was considered by Time magazine one of the ten best bands in the world outside the United States. 

==== Brazilian heavy metal ====


Brazilian metal originated in the mid 1980s with three prominent scenes: Belo Horizonte, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The most famous Brazilian metal bands are Sepultura, Angra, Krisiun and the singer Andre Matos. Sepultura is considered an influential thrash metal band, influencing the development of death metal.

Famous bands of the 1980s include Korzus, Sarcófago, Overdose, Dorsal Atlântica, Viper, MX, PUS, Mutilator, Chakal, Vulcano and Attomica. 

There&#x27;s also Massacration, a Brazilian satirical heavy metal band, self-proclaimed the &quot;greatest band in the world&quot;.

As well as thrash metal, Brazil is also a reference in death metal, the main bands in the scene include Krisiun, Torture Squad, Claustrofobia, Rebaelliun, Visceral Leishmaniasis (Brazil), Obskure, Vulcano, Mental Horror and the precursors Sepultura and Sarcófago. There is a growth in the appearance of Brazilian death metal bands with women in formation, especially Nervosa, who gained a lot of prestige after their performance at Rock in Rio in 2019. The female trio were invited to participate in the Wacken Open Air festival in 2020, but the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Brazilian Death Metal scene is spread across all regions in the country, especially in the Northeast region where it is represented by bands like Headhunter D.C., Escarnium, Decomposed God, Infested Blood, Heavenless, Torment the Skies, Pandemmy, Burning Torment, Infectos, Krenak and especially Cangaço which is a band that mixes Death metal with elements of Baião (regional rhythm of Northeast Brazil) and on 2010 was the winner of W.O.A Metal Battle Brazil and went to the finals of the Wacken Open Air festival.

=== Funk carioca ===

Funk carioca is a type of dance music from Rio de Janeiro, derived from and was until the late 1990s, superficially similar to Miami bass. In Rio it is most often simply known as funk, although it is very different musically from what funk means in most other places and contexts. Like other types of hip-hop, funk carioca lifts heavily from samples such as international rips or from previous funk music. Many popular funk songs sampled music from the film &quot;Rocky&quot;. Funk was popularized in Rio&#x27;s favelas in the 1980s, with songs like Feira de Acari by Mc Batata, with Furacão 2000, Mc Marlboro and Brazilian versions of freestyle songs by the singer Latino, later turning more aggressive in the 1990s, with precarious lyrics and several MCs with direct links with drug trafficking.

=== Hip-hop music ===
In São Paulo and other places in the south of Brazil, in more urban areas, hip-hop music is very popular. They dress similarly to American rappers. 

Brazilian hip-hop is heavily associated with racial and economic issues in the country, where a lot of Afro-Brazilians live in economically disadvantaged communities, known in Brazil as favelas. São Paulo is where hip-hop began in the country, but it soon spread all over Brazil, and today, almost every big Brazilian city, including Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte, Recife and Brasília, has a hip hop scene. São Paulo has gained a strong, underground Brazilian rap scene since its emergence in the late 1980s with many independent labels forming for young rappers to establish themselves on.

=== Brazilian bass ===
Brazilian bass is a subgenre of house that originated as a derivation of mainstream deep house music of early 2010s, fused with tech house elements and some minimalistic influences from bass house. The tempo typically range from 120 to 125 bpm. The genre is characterized by distinguishable deep punchy basslines, often making use of low-pitched and filtering effects. The genre was created in Brasília around the mid-2010s, but its national and international repercussion only happened in 2016 with DJs Alok, Bruno Martini and Sevenn.

===Brazilian electronic music===
Electronic music in Brazil started in the 1980s, when the genre of music was getting popular in the world. The first event involving the genre of music in Brazil was in 1988 in São Paulo, with DJ Mau Mau. In the 1990s, the genre was getting bigger in Brazil and world, some of the most famous disk jockeys were DJ Marky and DJ Patife. In the 2000s, dubstep started getting famous in Brazil. Brazil has a lot of famous electronic music musicians, like Alok, Kasino, and Vintage Culture.

=== Brazilian phonk===

Brazilian Phonk is a subgenre of phonk that combines elements of funk carioca and drift phonk, creating a distinct and aggressive sound, with lyrics that address topics such as violence, drugs, sex and ostentation. Both VanMilli and MC Binn are two of the heavy-hitters in the genre.

<text>Joseph John Rosenthal (October 9, 1911 – August 20, 2006) was an American photographer who received the Pulitzer Prize for his iconic World War II photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;, taken during the 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima. His picture became one of the best-known photographs of the war, and was replicated as the United States Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia.

==Early life==
Joseph Rosenthal was born on October 9, 1911, in Washington, D.C. His parents were Russian-Jewish immigrants. He had four brothers. His interest in photography started as a hobby during the Great Depression. He graduated from McKinley High School in 1929, and after working as an office boy, he moved to San Francisco where he became a reporter-photographer for &quot;The San Francisco News&quot; in 1932. He attended University of San Francisco in 1943 and converted to Catholicism while in attendance there.

== World War II ==
Rosenthal was rejected by the U.S. Army as a photographer because of poor eyesight. In 1941, he attended the University of San Francisco and joined the staff of the Associated Press (AP). In 1943, he joined the United States Maritime Service as a photographer and served as a warrant officer documenting life aboard ship in the British Isles and North Africa. In 1944, he rejoined the Associated Press and followed the United States Army and U.S. Marine Corps in the Pacific Theater of Operations as a war correspondent at Hollandia, New Guinea, Guam, Peleliu, Angaur, and Iwo Jima.

=== Flag-raising photo ===
On Friday morning, February 23, 1945, four days after the Marines landed at Iwo Jima, Rosenthal was making his daily visit to the island on a Marine landing craft when he heard that an American flag was being raised atop Mount Suribachi, a volcano at the southern tip of the island. Upon landing, Rosenthal hurried toward Suribachi, lugging along his bulky Speed Graphic camera, the standard for press photographers at the time. Together with Marine combat still photographer Pvt. Bob Campbell and Marine color movie photographer Sgt. Bill Genaust, he began the climb up to the summit of Mount Suribachi. When they got about halfway up, they met Staff Sgt. Louis Lowery, a photographer with the Marine publication &quot;Leatherneck&quot; who was coming down the volcano after an enemy grenade explosion on top had knocked him off his feet and broke his camera. Lowery told them that the flag had already been raised at 10:40 am, and he had gotten photos of the flag on the summit. Lowery told them the view was good from the summit, and Rosenthal convinced Genaust and Campbell to continue to take him to the top with them since they were armed.
On the high and windy summit of Mount Suribachi, Rosenthal discovered a group of Marines attaching a large flag to a length of steel pipe. Nearby, he saw the smaller flag flying and managed to get himself photoed by Campbell under the flag with Sgt. Genaust and Army Pfc. George Burn, a photographer for &quot;Yank, the Army Weekly&quot;. Another group of Marines was getting ready to lower the smaller flag at the same instant the larger flag was raised under an officer&#x27;s orders. Rosenthal briefly contemplated attempting to photograph both of the flags at once, but was not in a position to get both flags in the photograph (Pvt. Campbell did capture an image of the first flag coming down while the second flag was going up), so he focused his attention on the group of men preparing to raise the second flag.

Rosenthal piled stones and a sandbag so he had something on which to stand, as he was only 5 feet and 5 inches (1.65 m) tall. He set his camera for a lens setting between f/8 and f/11 and the shutter speed at 1/400th second. Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw six Marines start to raise the second flag. He swung his camera around toward the action and pushed the shutter. Three feet to his right, Sgt. Genaust captured the flag-raising from nearly the same angle using color motion picture film. To make sure he had a worthwhile photo to send to the AP, Rosenthal took another black and white photograph showing four of the second flag-raisers steadying the flagstaff and waiting for the bottom of the pipe to be more secured with rocks; and afterwards a rope. When that was done, Rosenthal gathered a group of sixteen Marines and two Navy corpsmen around the base of the flagstaff for a posed shot (called the &quot;Gung Ho&quot; photo) which included First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, the only officer on the summit, who had volunteered to take the 40-man patrol up Mount Suribachi that morning to seize and occupy the crest and raise the battalion&#x27;s flag.

==== Impact of flag-raising photo ====

The American people saw Rosenthal&#x27;s photo as a potent symbol of victory. Wire services flashed what would become a Pulitzer Prize–winning photograph around the world in time to appear in the Sunday newspapers on February 25, 1945 (Lowery&#x27;s photos weren&#x27;t released until late 1947). Many magazines ran the photo on their covers. After the battle for Iwo Jima was over and won, the photo was used for posters in war bond drives through over 30 cities from May 11 through July 4, 1945, which raised $26.3 billion.

Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph became an enduring icon. Artists used the photo as a model for the United States Marine Corps War Memorial (1954) — commonly referred to as &quot;The Iwo Jima Memorial&quot; — at Arlington, Virginia, and the U.S. Postal Service commemorated the photo on a U.S. postage stamp. A version of the Marine Corps memorial also stands on the parade ground at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina.

== Later years and death ==
In later years, when asked about the photo, he would say &quot;I took the picture; the Marines took Iwo Jima.&quot;
Rosenthal left the AP later in 1945 and became the chief photographer and manager of Times Wide World Photos. He later joined the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. He worked there as a photographer for 35 years, before retiring in 1981. His name was inscribed (across from the memorial sculptor Felix de Weldon&#x27;s name) on the bottom right side of the front (west side) of the Marine Corps War Memorial in 1982. On April 13, 1996, Rosenthal was named an honorary Marine by then Commandant of the Marine Corps General Charles C. Krulak.

On August 20, 2006, at age 94, Rosenthal died of natural causes in his sleep at a center for assisted living in Novato, California, located in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area, in northern Marin County. Rosenthal was cremated. A Marine Corps ceremony that was open to the public was held for him at the Marines&#x27; Memorial Club on September 15 and a Catholic funeral mass was held for him on September 16, 2006, at St. Emydius Catholic Church, both located in San Francisco, California.

== Awards and honors==
* Pulitzer Prize – Rosenthal received the Pulitzer Prize in 1945 for the iconic photo. The committee noted that photo as &quot;depicting one of the war&#x27;s great moments,&quot; a &quot;frozen flash of history.&quot;
* International Photography Hall of Fame, St. Louis, Missouri
* Navy Distinguished Public Service Award – The United States Marine Corps posthumously awarded Rosenthal the Distinguished Public Service Award (medal) on September 15, 2006:

== Legacy ==
The 2006 Hollywood film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, directed by Clint Eastwood, tells the stories of the American flag raisers who raised the famous flag on Mount Suribachi and depicts Rosenthal&#x27;s involvement in the events that led up to his taking the iconic flag raising photograph. Rosenthal was portrayed by actor Ned Eisenberg in the film.

Reporters extensively interviewed Rosenthal after September 11, 2001, when Thomas E. Franklin shot a similar iconic photograph, &quot;Ground Zero Spirit&quot;, depicting the raising of the flag by three firefighters at the World Trade Center. Rosenthal and Franklin met several times after the event.

<text>Alkaline Trio is an American punk rock band from Chicago. The band&#x27;s current members are Matt Skiba (guitar, vocals), Dan Andriano (bass, vocals), and Atom Willard (drums).

Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, &quot;Sundials&quot;, in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Andriano, who occupied the role of co-lead vocalist alongside Skiba. The band subsequently recorded an EP, &quot;For Your Lungs Only&quot; (1998), and its debut studio album, &quot;Goddamnit&quot; (1998). Following the release of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire&quot; (2000), Porter left the band and was replaced by Mike Felumlee for its subsequent album, &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; (2001).

Backed by the singles &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; and &quot;Private Eye&quot;, &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; significantly increased the band&#x27;s exposure, and its follow-up, &quot;Good Mourning&quot; (2003), charted highly on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Good Mourning&quot; marked the recording debut of longtime drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released &quot;Crimson&quot; which expanded upon the band&#x27;s punk rock influences, with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on &quot;Agony &amp; Irony&quot; (2008), which was released on Epic Records.

In 2010, the band released &quot;This Addiction&quot; on its own label Heart &amp; Skull and Epitaph. Recorded in the band&#x27;s home town of Chicago, with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest-charting album of their career, debuting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of &quot;Damnesia&quot;, which featured new, acoustic-based recordings of songs from across the band&#x27;s career. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;My Shame Is True&quot;, was released on April 2, 2013, while their ninth album, &quot;Is This Thing Cursed?&quot; was released on August 31, 2018, followed by a three track EP titled &quot;E.P.&quot; on March 19, 2020.

In June 2023, Grant departed from the band after twenty-two years, with Atom Willard being announced as his replacement soon thereafter. Their tenth album (and their final one with Grant), &quot;Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs&quot;, was released on January 26, 2024.

== History ==
===Early years, &quot;Goddamnit&quot; and &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire&quot; (1996–2000)===

Alkaline Trio was formed in December 1996, originally consisting of Matt Skiba (guitar/lead vocals), Rob Doran (bass/vocals), and Glenn Porter (drums/vocals). 1997 saw the release of the band&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Sundials&quot;. This was followed shortly after by the departure of Rob Doran, after which Dan Andriano, former singer of Asian Man Records band Tuesday and bassist for Slapstick, took his place and they began recording. The band released their second EP entitled &quot;For Your Lungs Only&quot;, in 1998. Later that year, the band released their first full-length album, &quot;Goddamnit&quot;, followed by &quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll Catch Fire&quot; in 2000, both on Asian Man Records). In 1999, the band released the &quot;I Lied My Face Off&quot; EP on Asian Man Records and filmed their first music video, directed by Link 80 guitarist Matt Bettinelli-Olpin. Also in 2000, the band released a collection of their previously released EPs on their self-titled album.

=== &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; and &quot;Good Mourning&quot; (2001–2004) ===
In 2001, the band released &quot;From Here To Infirmary&quot; on Vagrant Records. This album inspired music videos for the singles &quot;Stupid Kid&quot; and &quot;Private Eye.&quot; The album was the band&#x27;s first album to reach above &quot;Billboard&quot; top 200 mark and the first to gross six figures in sales.

Their next full-length album was &quot;Good Mourning&quot;, released in 2003, with the album&#x27;s launch single &quot;We&#x27;ve Had Enough&quot; seeing much the same success as the previous single &quot;Stupid Kid&quot;. The album was something of a departure from earlier works, featuring greater production values.

The band appeared on various compilation albums, notably &quot;Plea for Peace&quot; Vol. 1, &quot;Vagrant Records: Another Year on the Streets&quot; Vol. 1, 2, and 3, and &quot;Rock Against Bush&quot; Vol. 1. Matt Skiba and Dan Andriano have both independently recorded split records, Skiba with Kevin Seconds on Asian Man Records and Andriano with Mike Felumlee on Double Zero Records, as well as jointly performing backing vocal duties on the album &quot;This is Unity Music&quot; by Common Rider. They recorded two split EPs: one with Hot Water Music in 2002 and the other with One Man Army in 2004.

In 2004, Andriano became a member of The Falcon, a group consisting of The Lawrence Arms&#x27; bassist Brendan Kelly, previously of Slapstick (alongside Andriano) and The Broadways, and drummer Neil Hennessy. The Falcon also saw contributions from Todd Mohney of The Killing Tree and formerly Rise Against. The band released an EP, &quot;God Don&#x27;t Make No Trash / Up Your Ass With Broken Glass&quot; in 2005 and its first full-length, &quot;Unicornography&quot; in September 2006.

=== &quot;Crimson&quot; and &quot;Agony &amp; Irony&quot; (2005–2008) ===

Alkaline Trio released their fifth studio album on Vagrant Records, titled &quot;Crimson&quot;, on May 24, 2005, which featured the single &quot;Time to Waste.&quot; The single for this song also included bonus tracks produced by Squirtgun and Common Rider bassist Mass Giorgini. The tracks &quot;Mercy Me&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot; have also been released as singles from the album.

In December 2005, a dual-disc special edition re-release of &quot;Crimson&quot; hit store shelves. This album features the original cut of &quot;Crimson&quot; released earlier in the year, while the 2nd disc has demo and acoustic/live versions of some of the songs. Additionally, an enhanced version of the lyrics and liner notes are available for download with personal messages from the band members on the history and/or inspiration(s) behind the songs.

In September 2006, &quot;Patent Pending&quot;, the debut album by Matt Skiba&#x27;s side project Heavens was released. The band consisted of Skiba on guitar and vocals, and Josiah Steinbrick (of hardcore punk outfit F-Minus) on bass. On the album, the duo were joined by The Mars Volta&#x27;s Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens on organ and Matthew Compton on drums and percussion. Skiba was playing with Heavens during a short tour in the fall of 2006.

In October 2006, it was announced that Alkaline Trio had signed with V2 Records. On January 12, 2007, the North America branch of the label announced that they were undergoing restructuring to focus on their back catalogue and digital distribution. As a result, their employees were let go and their roster of artists left as free agents.

January 30, 2007, marked the release of &quot;Remains&quot; an album of B-sides, rarities and live performances. An accompanying DVD contained performances from The Occult Roots Tour and all the band&#x27;s music videos to date. This marked the end of their association with Vagrant Records.

During late May 2007 the band began listing Epic Records as its label on their MySpace.

On April 4, 2008, &quot;In Vein&quot; was made available for streaming through the band&#x27;s Myspace profile. 
On April 7, the album&#x27;s title Agony &amp; Irony and track listing was revealed.

===&quot;This Addiction&quot; (2009–2011)===

During a concert in May 2009, the band revealed that they were no longer signed to Epic Records and that they would be releasing new material through their own label later in the year. Recording began that July. Four songs from the album (&quot;This Addiction&quot;, &quot;Dead On The Floor&quot;, &quot;Dine, Dine My Darling&quot;, and &quot;Dorothy&quot;) were debuted on that tour with Saves the Day.

On November 18, 2009, the band announced that they would be releasing their new album on their own newly formed label, Heart &amp; Skull, a joint venture with Epitaph Records. In the same article, Skiba also confirmed that the new album would be released on February 23, 2010, with another new song announced, entitled &quot;The American Scream.&quot; The trio went back to their home in Chicago to record This Addiction after recording their last few albums in L.A. The band worked hard to go back to their roots with the album, Atlas Studios being the place they recorded their first three albums.
 
On December 1, Alkaline Trio confirmed to Rock Sound that the title of their new album would be &quot;This Addiction&quot;: &quot;It is the first song on the record and the title of our new album,&quot; said vocalist Matt Skiba. &quot;The song takes heroin addiction as a metaphor for love. The whole record is really personal, all three of us have been through quite a bit since our last album [2008&#x27;s &quot;Agony &amp; Irony&quot;] and it is all expressed through this, all the songs are about the relationships we&#x27;ve been in and so the record has a constant theme.&quot; The album debuted at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the highest the band has ever charted to date.

Alkaline Trio released an LP, &quot;Damnesia&quot;, on July 12, 2011. Consisting of &quot;a selection of beloved fan favorites selected from the group&#x27;s extensive catalogue and presented in an intimate semi-unplugged format&quot;, the LP also included two new songs, &quot;Olde English 800&quot; and &quot;I Remember a Rooftop&quot;, as well as a cover version of the Violent Femmes&#x27; &quot;I Held Her in My Arms&quot;. The band went on a fifteenth-anniversary United States tour in support of the album.

===&quot;My Shame Is True&quot; and &quot;Past Live&quot; tour (2012–2015)===

On July 14, 2012, in an interview with The Punk Site, it was confirmed by Dan Andriano that the band would begin recording their next studio album that October. &quot;We&#x27;re going to go work with Bill [Stevenson] at Fort Collins at the Blasting Room. Bill and Jason [Livermore]. We&#x27;ve all wanted to work with Bill for a long time and this is kind of the time to do it. So we&#x27;re going to go hang out there in October. Make a new record.&quot;
On October 27, 2012, Skiba confirmed that the band had completed the album.
On February 1, 2013, the band released a lyric video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I Wanna Be A Warhol&quot;. On February 5, the band released the artwork and track-listing for the album, titled &quot;My Shame Is True&quot;, as well as the artwork and track-listing for an EP called &quot;Broken Wing&quot;. Both &quot;My Shame Is True&quot; and &quot;Broken Wing&quot; were released on April 2, 2013. The album peaked at #24 on the Billboard charts The band toured to support the album during 2013.

In 2014, the band conducted an anthology tour dubbed the &quot;Past Live&quot; tour, in which they performed all eight studio albums in their entirety over four consecutive shows in several cities.

===&quot;Is This Thing Cursed?&quot; (2016–2019)===

In an interview on July 20, 2015, Dan Andriano was quoted saying, &quot;We need to make a new record, pretty much. We&#x27;re gonna go to England and play some shows with NOFX, do a couple festivals this fall, but it&#x27;s time for us to make a new record. But I&#x27;m doing some Emergency Room stuff and I&#x27;m not sure what Matt&#x27;s gonna be up to with the Sekrets, if he&#x27;s gonna tour on that, but I think by early next year we&#x27;re gonna be recording another record.&quot;

While the production of the ninth album was postponed by Matt Skiba&#x27;s work with Blink-182, in an interview on July 3, 2016, Skiba assured that the album would move forward, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll be writing for a new Alkaline Trio record while on this summer tour so once things with Blink cool down a bit, the Trio can go in and make a new record and start touring again while Blink is on break. [...] It&#x27;s such a unique and wonderful position to be in, having two full time bands that people – myself included – are big fans of.&quot;

Alkaline Trio opened for the Misfits on December 28 and 30, 2017. On January 11, 2018, the band announced that the Chicago stop during their 2014/15 Past Live Tour (all eight studio albums performed in four nights) will be released in its entirety on Blu-ray, and as an eight-LP box set. &quot;Past Live&quot; will be released in February 2018. In addition to this announcement, the band also hinted at new music coming soon. Andriano stated that &quot;There&#x27;s not an inch of me that feels like we&#x27;re done making music, or we&#x27;re done making new stuff. I wanna be a band that people want to hear new stuff from. Because I feel like I&#x27;m still in a band that wants to write good, new music.&quot;

Alkaline Trio was slated to perform at the Self Help Festival on March 3, 2018. However, they were forced to back out after Skiba went through throat surgery. The band shared on Instagram: &quot;Matt&#x27;s recovery from throat surgery is not healing as quickly as planned and, per his doctor, he can&#x27;t perform. Everything went well, he just needs more time to heal so he can play many shows in the future. Thank you for understanding.&quot;

On July 19, 2018, Alkaline Trio announced their ninth studio album, &quot;Is This Thing Cursed?&quot;, along with the release of the lead single, &quot;Blackbird.&quot; The band also went on a North American tour to support the album with opening act, Together Pangea. On August 2, 2018, it was announced on Skiba&#x27;s Instagram that Grant would not be drumming on the tour due to ongoing health problems. Skiba and Andriano recruited former My Chemical Romance touring drummer, Jarrod Alexander, to fill in for Grant on the tour, which began the next day in Dallas, Texas and ended on October 18 in Santa Cruz, California, while the album was released on August 31.

===&quot;E.P.,&quot; Grant&#x27;s departure, and &quot;Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs&quot; (2020–present)===
In January 2020, the band posted a picture of Andriano in a recording studio with the subtitle &quot;New Jams!&quot; (as well as some pictures with Skiba and Andriano in vocal booths) on Instagram, indicating that work on new material was on its way.

On March 19, 2020, the band released a three-song EP entitled &quot;E.P.&quot; after postponing a planned tour with Bad Religion due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the songs being recorded before the pandemic. Drummer Derek Grant returned to the band around this time, after taking a lengthy break. Skiba announced in Instagram comments in April 2020 that he is currently writing more music for the band. In June 2021, the tour with Bad Religion was rescheduled with the first show taking place in Riverside, California, on October 15, 2021.

In March 2022, the band went on a UK co-headlining tour with Taking Back Sunday. During an interview on the tour, Grant discussed their plans for new music, stating that new songs had mostly been played at soundchecks, but that &quot;things are starting to kind of take shape, and I think we&#x27;re at the stage now where we&#x27;re ready to start actually kind of committing to tape somehow, even if it&#x27;s just on an iPhone at you know, soundchecks.&quot; Grant also discussed plans for a 20th anniversary celebration for &quot;Good Mourning&quot;, explaining that he had some ideas for what they may want to do, such as shows or a rerelease of the album.

On June 8, 2023, Grant announced his departure from the band after 22 years, citing mental health reasons and a desire to pursue music production and graphic design. On June 15, the band announced Atom Willard (who had previously served as a touring replacement in 2001) as their new drummer.

On October 17, 2023, the band officially announced their next album &quot;Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs&quot; with a release date of January 26, 2024. This was accompanied by the release of the album&#x27;s title track and the announcement of a 2024 headlining tour with Drug Church. In the following weeks, the band also released the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Bad Time&quot; on November 30, 2023. The album features the last contributions from Grant, as he had completed his drum parts prior to his departure. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Versions of You&quot;, came out on January 5, 2024.

In support of the &quot;Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs&quot;, Alkaline Trio embarked on multiple headlining tours with support from Drug Church, Worries, Spanish Love Songs, and Slomosa, while also supporting Dropkick Murphys on their 2024 Australian tour. Later that year, the band also released a joint single &quot;The Sacrifice / At Sickness.&quot; The band initially recorded the songs in the same sessions for &quot;Blood, Hair, and Eyeballs&quot;, but cut them from the final track list for time reasons.

==Music style, influences, lyrics, related bands, and similar bands==
===Music style, influences, and lyrics===
Alkaline Trio&#x27;s style has been primarily described as pop-punk, punk rock, emo, and alternative rock. Alkaline Trio&#x27;s musical influences include Screeching Weasel, Pegboy, Naked Raygun, Ramones, Misfits, and Green Day. The band&#x27;s dark, gothic aesthetic borrows from such acts the Cure, the Sisters of Mercy, Ministry, Front 242, Bauhaus, and Joy Division.

Alkaline Trio&#x27;s lyrical themes have included alcoholism, women, love, and depression. Dan Ozzi of &quot;Differuser&quot; wrote that Alkaline Trio&#x27;s &quot;lyrics combine the macabre imagery of the Misfits with the clever turns of phrases of Jawbreaker.&quot;

===Related bands and similar bands===
Alkaline Trio is part of a very large circle of Chicago punk/hardcore bands. Skiba was previously a member of Jerkwater, Blunt, and Traitors. Former drummer Glenn Porter played in 88 Fingers Louie. Andriano&#x27;s previous bands were Slapstick and Tuesday. Mike Felumlee (drums) has also performed with Duvall and Smoking Popes. Derek Grant, who joined the band after the &quot;From Here to Infirmary&quot; album, has also played for Laughing Glass, Skolars, Telegraph, The Suicide Machines, Thoughts of Ionesco, Dan Zanes, The Sugar Pup and Sean Madigan Hoen. In 2004 Dan Andriano joined the newly assembled group, The Falcon, with Andriano performing with fellow former Slapstick member Brendan Kelly (guitar and vocals), Neil Hennessy (drums), and Todd Mohney, a former member of Rise Against. Mohney played guitar on the first EP but did not appear in the band&#x27;s debut album Unicornography, and his spot was filled in by Kelly and Hennessy.

Alkaline Trio have been compared to bands such as Jawbreaker and Green Day.

In 2006 Skiba started the side-project Heavens with Josiah Steinbrick, previously of F-Minus. Their debut album, &quot;Patent Pending&quot; was released on Epitaph Records.

On September 16, 2009, bassist and co-vocalist Dan Andriano announced he would be playing a series of solo shows across the US under the name &quot;Dan Andriano In The Emergency Room&quot;. The band announced on Twitter that Andriano will be releasing his debut solo album under the same name in summer 2011. The album, &quot;Hurricane Season&quot;, was released on August 9, 2011, under the moniker &#x27;Dan Andriano in the Emergency Room&#x27;. A second album followed in 2015 named &quot;Party Adjacent&quot;.

Skiba was set to release his debut solo album on February 14, 2010, but it was delayed until the summer of 2010 due to the new Alkaline Trio album. The album&#x27;s name is &quot;Demos&quot;. In May 2012 Skiba released his second solo album (featuring his backing band, The Sekrets) entitled &quot;Babylon&quot;. In June 2015 Skiba released his third solo album with The Sekrets entitled &quot;KUTS&quot;.

From 2015 to 2022, Skiba performed and recorded with rock band Blink-182. He began performing with the group starting with three shows in March 2015 filling in for long-time guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge who departed the group for the second time earlier that year.

<text>The is a major passenger railway company in Japan and the largest of the seven Japan Railways Group companies. The company name is officially abbreviated as JR-EAST or JR East in English, and as in Japanese. The company&#x27;s headquarters are in Yoyogi, Shibuya, Tokyo, next to Shinjuku Station. It is listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange (it formerly had secondary listings in the Nagoya and Osaka stock exchanges), is a constituent of the TOPIX Large70 index, and is one of three Japan Railways Group constituents of the Nikkei 225 index, the others being JR Central and JR West.

==History==

JR East was incorporated on 1 April 1987 after being spun off from the government-run Japanese National Railways (JNR). The spin-off was nominally &quot;privatization&quot;, as the company was actually a wholly owned subsidiary of the government-owned JNR Settlement Corporation for several years, and was not completely sold to the public until 2002.

Following the breakup, JR East ran the operations on former JNR lines in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Tōhoku region, and surrounding areas.
==Lines==

Railway lines of JR East primarily serve the Kanto and Tohoku regions, along with adjacent areas in Kōshin&#x27;etsu region (Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi) and Shizuoka prefectures.

===Shinkansen===

===Kanto region===

These lines have sections inside the Tokyo suburban area () designated by JR East. This does not necessarily mean that the lines are fully inside the Greater Tokyo Area.

==Sponsorship==

JR East co-sponsors the JEF United Chiba J-League football club , which was formed by a merger between the JR East and Furukawa Electric company teams.

==Carbon emission plan==
JR East aims to reduce its carbon emissions by half, as measured over the period 1990–2030. This would be achieved by increasing the efficiency of trains and company-owned thermal power stations and by developing hybrid trains.

==Alleged revolutionary front==
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has stated that JR East&#x27;s official union is a front for a revolutionary political organization called the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (Revolutionary Marxist Faction). An investigation of this is ongoing.

==Culture foundation==
The East Japan Railway Culture Foundation is a non-profit organization established by JR East for the purpose of developing a &quot;richer railway culture&quot;. The Railway Museum in Saitama is operated by the foundation.

==Bids outside Japan==
JR East held a 15% shareholding in West Midlands Trains with Abellio and Mitsui that commenced operating the West Midlands franchise in England in December 2017. JR East sold their stake to Abellio in September 2021. The same consortium were also listed to be bidding for the South Eastern franchise.

<text>, also referred to as , is one of the Japan Railways Group (JR Group) companies and operates in western Honshu. It has its headquarters in Kita-ku, Osaka. It is listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is a constituent of the TOPIX Large70 index, and is also one of only three Japan Railways Group constituents of the Nikkei 225 index: the others are JR East and JR Central.

== Lines ==

===Shinkansen===
* Hokuriku Shinkansen ( - )
* San&#x27;yō Shinkansen
* Hakata Minami Line
:: Officially not a Shinkansen
JR-West&#x27;s highest-grossing line is the Sanyo Shinkansen high-speed rail line between Osaka and Fukuoka. The Sanyo Shinkansen alone accounts for about 40% of JR-West&#x27;s passenger revenues. The company also operates Hakata Minami Line, a short commuter line with Shinkansen trains in Fukuoka.

===Urban Network===
The &quot;Urban Network&quot; is JR-West&#x27;s name for its commuter rail lines in the Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto metropolitan area. These lines together comprise 610 km of track, have 245 stations and account for about 43% of JR-West&#x27;s passenger revenues. Urban Network stations are equipped to handle ICOCA fare cards. Train control on these lines is highly automated, and during peak hours trains run as often as every two minutes.

JR-West&#x27;s Urban Network competes with a number of private commuter rail operators around Osaka, the &quot;Big 4&quot; being Hankyu Railway/Hanshin Railway (Hankyu bought Hanshin in April 2005), Keihan Railway, Kintetsu, and Nankai Railway. JR-West&#x27;s market share in the region is roughly equal to that of the Big 4 put together, largely due to its comprehensive network and high-speed commuter trains (Special Rapid Service trains on the Kobe and Kyoto lines operate at up to 130 km/h).

==History==
JR-West was incorporated as a business corporation (kabushiki kaisha) on April 1, 1987, as part of the breakup of the state-owned Japanese National Railways (JNR). Initially, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of the JNR Settlement Corporation (JNRSC), a special company created to hold the assets of the former JNR while they were shuffled among the new JR companies.

For the first four years of its existence, JR-West leased its highest-revenue line, the Sanyō Shinkansen, from the separate Shinkansen Holding Corporation. JR-West purchased the line in October 1991 at a cost of 974.1 billion JPY (about US$7.2 billion) in long-term debt.

JNRSC sold 68.3% of JR-West in an initial public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1996. After JNRSC was dissolved in October 1998, its shares of JR-West were transferred to the government-owned Japan Railway Construction Public Corporation (JRCC), which merged into the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency (JRTT) as part of a bureaucratic reform package in October 2003. JRTT offered all of its shares in JR-West to the public in an international IPO in 2004, ending the era of government ownership of JR-West. JR-West is now listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Nagoya Stock Exchange, Osaka Securities Exchange and Fukuoka Stock Exchange.

==Accidents and incidents==

* Shigaraki train disaster: A collision between a JR West and a Shigaraki Kōgen Railway train in Shigaraki (now Koka), Shiga Prefecture on 14 May 1991, killed 42 people.

* Amagasaki derailment: A train derailment in Amagasaki, Hyōgo Prefecture on 25 April 2005, killed 107 people.

<text>Harold Peter Henry &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Reese (July 23, 1918 – August 14, 1999) was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop for the Brooklyn / Los Angeles Dodgers from 1940 to 1958. A ten-time All-Star, Reese contributed to seven National League championships for the Dodgers and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984. Reese is also famous for his support of his teammate Jackie Robinson, the first black player in the major leagues&#x27; modern era, especially in Robinson&#x27;s difficult first years, most notably when he put his arm around Robinson during a pre-game warmup in front of a heckling crowd.

==Early life==
Reese&#x27;s nickname originated in his childhood, as he was a champion marbles player (a &quot;pee wee&quot; is a small marble). Reese was born in Ekron, Meade County, Kentucky, and raised there until he was nearly eight years old, when his family moved to Louisville. In high school, Reese was so small that he did not play baseball until his senior year, at which time he weighed only 120 pounds and played just six games as a second baseman. He graduated from duPont Manual High School in 1935, where he played for a legendary coach, Ralph Kimmel. He worked as a cable splicer for the Louisville phone company, only playing amateur baseball in a church league. When Reese&#x27;s team reached the league championship, the minor league Louisville Colonels allowed them to play the championship game on their field. Reese impressed Colonels owner Cap Neal, who signed him to a contract for a $200 bonus. While playing for the Colonels, he was affectionately referred to by his teammates as &quot;The Little Colonel.&quot;

==Baseball career==
By 1938, Reese was the Colonels&#x27; regular shortstop and one of the top prospects in the minors; Boston Red Sox farm director Billy Evans was so impressed by Reese that he recommended the Red Sox buy the team. Evans and owner Tom Yawkey both knew that Boston&#x27;s regular shortstop, Joe Cronin, was nearing the end of his career.

However, Cronin was also the team&#x27;s manager, and still thought of himself as a regular shortstop. When Yawkey sent Cronin to Louisville to scout Reese, Cronin realized that he was scouting his own replacement. Cronin deliberately downplayed Reese&#x27;s talent and suggested Reese be traded. It took a while to find a buyer, since the other teams assumed something had to be wrong with Reese if the Red Sox wanted to get rid of him. However, on July 18, 1939, Reese was sent to Brooklyn for $35,000 and four players to be named later. This trade is now considered one of the most lopsided deals in baseball history. As it turned out, Cronin was only a part-time player after 1941.

Reese stayed in Louisville for the rest of the 1939 season, and was called up to Brooklyn in time for the 1940 season. In an ironic twist, he walked into a situation where his manager was also the regular shortstop—in this case, Leo Durocher. Unlike Cronin, however, Durocher was willing to give up his spot in the lineup to Reese.

===Early playing career===

Reese&#x27;s rookie season in 1940 was curtailed by a broken heel bone that limited him to 84 games in what had looked to be a promising season (.272 batting average with 58 runs scored). He had a thrilling moment that year, hitting a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the New York Giants. In 1941, he hit .229 and led the league with 47 errors. Even playing in the World Series that year was a forgettable experience for Reese, as he batted .200 and made three errors in the five-game Yankee win. It was in the 1942 campaign that he truly established himself, making the National League All-Star team for the first of ten consecutive years and leading National League shortstops in both putouts and assists.

Like many players of his era, he missed three seasons due to military service. Reese enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943 and shipped out to fight in the Pacific theater of World War II. He played on the Aiea Naval Hospital baseball team while stationed in Hawaii. With Reese in the service, the Dodgers languished, finishing no better than third place and as poorly as 42 games out (in seventh place) in 1943. Upon his return in 1946, Reese immediately righted the ship as the Dodgers battled the St. Louis Cardinals in a tight pennant race. The two teams ended the season tied for first place and met in the 1946 National League tie-breaker series. It was the first playoff tiebreaker in Major League Baseball history. The Cardinals won the first two games of the best-of-three-game series to capture the National League pennant.

===Jackie Robinson===
In 1947, some Dodgers players began circulating a petition when word spread that Brooklyn intended to bring Jackie Robinson up from their farm team in Montreal. The players assumed that Reese, who grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, would sign. According to sportswriter Roger Kahn, who later became close friends with Reese, the petition essentially said, &quot;If you bring up the nigger, trade us. We won&#x27;t play.&quot; However, the popular Reese refused to sign the petition and it died. When a sportswriter asked Reese if he felt threatened by Robinson taking his position of shortstop, Reese simply responded, &quot;If he can take my job, he&#x27;s entitled to it.&quot;

Reese was one of the few welcoming to Robinson, who endured horrible abuse from the crowds and fellow players, including pitchers who threw directly at his head and players who berated him with racial slurs. After spending a day with the Dodgers in 1947, sportswriter Jimmy Cannon concluded that, &quot;Robinson is the loneliest man I have ever seen in sports.&quot;

When Robinson joined the Dodgers in 1947 and traveled with them during their first road trip, he was heckled by fans in Cincinnati. During pre-game infield practice at Crosley Field (the then-home of the Cincinnati Reds), Reese, the captain of the team, went over to Robinson, engaged him in conversation, and put his arm around his shoulder in a gesture of support that silenced the crowd. (According to a 2013 article on ESPN, Brian Cronin argues that the incident actually occurred in 1948 in Boston.)

In response to Dodgers teammate Pete Reiser&#x27;s comment about how democracy technically means that everybody&#x27;s equal, Reese said &quot;Well that&#x27;s true, but Jackie is catching special hell because he&#x27;s the only Black player. Maybe we ought to do something to make it more equal.” According to American journalist Lester Rodney, the moment of solidarity between Robinson and Reese in Cincinnati sparked a gradual decline in vile fan behavior by 1948. Rodney reported &quot;You began to get that feeling that the racists knew they were in the minority, and they may still be racist to the core but at least their mouths were shut! And you never heard them again.&quot;

The gesture is depicted in a bronze sculpture of Reese and Robinson, created by sculptor William Behrends, which was placed at MCU Park in Brooklyn and unveiled on November 1, 2005. In a 2005 article, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Bob Herbert highlighted Kahn&#x27;s statement that Reese&#x27;s gesture to Jackie Robinson is &quot;Baseball&#x27;s finest moment.&quot;

Throughout that difficult first year in the major leagues, Reese helped keep Robinson&#x27;s morale up amid all the abuse. As the 1947 season wore on, there was tacit acceptance of the fact that blacks were now playing big league ball and were probably there to stay. Reese became good friends with Robinson and was able to use humor to alleviate some of the tension and make Robinson laugh. Robinson still got pitches thrown at him, but, as Reese recounted to Kahn, &quot;I told him, &#x27;You know Jack, some of these guys are throwing at you because you&#x27;re black. But others are doing it just because they plain don&#x27;t like you.&#x27; His role in nurturing Jackie Robinson aside, 1947 was a superb year for Reese, as he batted .284 with a league-leading 104 walks. He also had a career best slugging average of .426. Their rapport soon led shortstop Reese and second baseman Robinson to become one of the most effective defensive pairs in the sport&#x27;s history. The friendship between Reese and Robinson is prominent in Roger Kahn&#x27;s classic 1972 work, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;.

The reason behind Reese&#x27;s passive attitude towards race is not entirely known, though some stories suggest that he was taught about the evils of racism at a young age when his father took him to a tree where a lynching had occurred.

When Robinson died in 1972, Reese was one of the pallbearers at his funeral.

===Later career===
In 1949, Reese had his only league lead in a significant batting category, topping all National Leaguers with 132 runs scored. The Dodgers won the pennant again that year, but the Yankees continued to dominate in the World Series, winning in five games despite Reese&#x27;s .316 Series average and team-leading five hits.

Reese became the Dodgers&#x27; team captain in 1950. In 1951, he had his career high in RBI, with 84. In 1952, he led the National League in stolen bases with 30. That year, Reese had his best Series, batting .345 with 10 hits, one home run and four RBI. In Game 3, Robinson and Reese pulled off a double steal; both later scored on a passed ball.

The 1953 Dodgers won the National League pennant with a mark of 105–49 for a .682 winning percentage. Reese was a mainstay for the team, with 108 runs scored and a .271 batting average. The Yankees, however, again defeated the Dodgers in the 1953 World Series, four games to two. After the season, the Dodgers offered Reese the position of manager; when Reese declined the promotion, the Dodgers hired Walter Alston, who remained manager for more than two decades.

In 1954, Reese batted .309, the only season he hit over .300. Though 36 years old, he was still going strong during the 1955 season, scoring 99 runs. In that year, the Dodgers won their first World Series. Reese had two RBI in Game 2. In Game 7, he singled and scored an insurance run. While on the field, he doubled Gil McDougald off first base after Sandy Amorós made a sensational catch of a Yogi Berra fly ball in left field and relayed the throw to Reese to help preserve the victory.

In 1957, Reese yielded his starting role to another black ballplayer, Charlie Neal. As the Dodgers moved west in 1958, Reese joined them as a backup infielder, retiring that year after batting .224 in 59 games. He coached for the Dodgers in the 1959 season, earning a second World Series ring.

==Career statistics==
In a 16-year major league career, Reese played in 2,166 games, accumulating 2,170 hits in 8,058 at bats for a .269 career batting average along with 126 home runs, 885 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .366. He retired with a .962 fielding percentage. In 44 World Series games, he batted .272 (46-for-169) with 20 runs, 2 home runs and 16 RBI.

Other than his Navy time between 1943 and 1945, Reese had no breaks in service and played at least 140 games in every year from 1941 to 1956. Consistently productive, he scored at least 75 runs from 1942 through 1956 and amassed 1,338 lifetime, best of any Dodger. Though he never won a Most Valuable Player Award, eight times he ranked in the top ten of the Most Valuable Player Award balloting. He also was a home run threat during a time when shortstops seldom hit home runs. Reese amassed 252 stolen bases in a period when steals were not an integral part of the game. Defensively, he was an outstanding gloveman, leading National League shortstops four times in putouts and ranking in the top 10 all-time in putouts and double plays.

One of the most popular players with both his teammates and the fans, the &quot;Little Colonel&quot; was the Dodgers&#x27; team captain, and he, not the manager, brought out the line-up card at the start of their games. Reese and Elston Howard have the dubious distinction of playing on the most losing World Series teams (six each). Reese&#x27;s only World Series win as a player, with the Dodgers in the 1955 World Series, occurred against Howard&#x27;s New York Yankees during Howard&#x27;s first World Series. No other non-Yankee ballplayer has appeared in that many World Series for the same team.

==Broadcasting career==
Following his retirement as a player, Reese enjoyed considerable success as a baseball play-by-play announcer and color commentator. He called &quot;Game of the Week&quot; telecasts on CBS from 1960 to 1965 (with Dizzy Dean) and for NBC from 1966 to 1968 (with Curt Gowdy). Reese also broadcast the 1967 and 1968 World Series for NBC Radio, called Cincinnati Reds telecasts in 1969–1970, and served as a part-time television analyst for the Montreal Expos in 1972.

==Later life and death==
In his later years, Reese was employed at Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, makers of Louisville Slugger baseball bats. He battled prostate and lung cancer during the final years of his life, and died on August 14, 1999, at his Louisville home. He is interred at Resthaven Memorial Park Cemetery in Louisville.

==Awards and honors==

In 1984, Reese was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum along with Rick Ferrell. On his entry, his support of Jackie Robinson was cited as well as his playing performance as a testament to his worthiness of the Hall.

A statue of Reese was erected in front of the main entrance of Louisville Slugger Field in 2000 and his number was retired by the Louisville Bats.

A statue of Reese and Jackie Robinson was erected in Brooklyn, New York in November 2005, in front of KeySpan Park (now Maimonides Park) where the Brooklyn Cyclones (high-A affiliate of the New York Mets) play. Their widows both attended the ceremony for the statue which memorializes the gesture of Reese and his teammates overcoming the racial barrier.

Reese was presented with the &quot;SABR Hero of Baseball Award&quot; at the Society for American Baseball Research&#x27;s June 1997 national convention at Louisville, Kentucky.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Reese as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Personal life==
Reese married Dorothy &quot;Dottie&quot; Walton on March 29, 1942; she outlived him by nearly 13 years. They had two children. Dottie died on March 7, 2012, just 22 days away from what would have been the couple&#x27;s Platinum wedding anniversary. His son, Mark, has made sports documentaries in Los Angeles over the past 25 years.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1987 movie &quot;The Brave Little Toaster,&quot; Radio mentions him in a line of dialogue.
* In the 2013 film &quot;42&quot;, Reese is played by Lucas Black. The moment when he put his arm around Robinson is also depicted.

<text>Offshore construction is the installation of structures and facilities in a marine environment, usually for the production and transmission of electricity, oil, gas and other resources. It is also called maritime engineering.

Construction and pre-commissioning is typically performed as much as possible onshore. To optimize the costs and risks of installing large offshore platforms, different construction strategies have been developed.

One strategy is to fully construct the offshore facility onshore, and tow the installation to site floating on its own buoyancy. Bottom founded structure are lowered to the seabed by de-ballasting (see for instance Condeep or Cranefree), whilst floating structures are held in position with substantial mooring systems.

The size of offshore lifts can be reduced by making the construction modular, with each module being constructed onshore and then lifted using a crane vessel into place onto the platform. A number of very large crane vessels were built in the 1970s which allow very large single modules weighing up to 14,000 tonnes to be fabricated and then lifted into place. 

Specialist floating hotel vessels known as flotels or accommodation rigs are used to accommodate workers during the construction and hook-up phases. This is a high cost activity due to the limited space and access to materials. 

Oil platforms are key fixed installations from which drilling and production activity is carried out. Drilling rigs are either floating vessels for deeper water or jack-up designs which are a barge with liftable legs. Both of these types of vessel are constructed in marine yards but are often involved during the construction phase to pre-drill some production wells.

Other key factors in offshore construction are the weather windows which define periods of relatively light weather during which continuous construction or other offshore activity can take place. Safety of personnel is another key construction parameter, an obvious hazard being a fall into the sea from which speedy recovery in cold waters is essential. Environmental issues are also often a major concern, and environmental impact assessment may be required during planning. 

The main types of vessels used for pipe laying are the &quot;derrick barge (DB)&quot;, the &quot;pipelay barge (LB)&quot; and the &quot;derrick/lay barge (DLB)&quot; combination. Closed diving bells in offshore construction are mainly used for saturation diving in water depths greater than , less than that, the surface oriented divers are transported through the water in a wet bell or diving stage (basket), a suspended platform deployed from a launch and recovery system (LARS, or &quot;A&quot; frame) on the deck of the rig or a diving support vessel. The basket is lowered to the working depth and recovered at a controlled rate for decompression. Closed bells can go to , but are normally used at . 

Offshore construction includes foundations engineering, structural design, construction, and/or repair of offshore structures, both commercial and military.

<text>The Tick is a superhero created by cartoonist Ben Edlund in 1986 as a newsletter mascot for the New England Comics chain of Boston-area comic book stores. The character is a parody of American comic book superheroes.

The character later spun off into an independent comic book series, multiple TV adaptations, and a video game. Various merchandise have also been based on the character. IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time ranked the Tick as No. 57.

==History==
In 1986, eighteen-year-old cartoonist Ben Edlund created the Tick as a mascot for a newsletter of the Brockton (Massachusetts) store New England Comics, where he was a frequent customer. Edlund expanded this into stories, beginning with the three-page tale &quot;The Tick&quot; in &quot;New England Comics Newsletter&quot; #14–15 (July–August – September–October 1986), in which the hero escapes from a mental institution. The character became popular and the store financed a black-and-white comic book series, with the first issue released in June, 1988, and subsequently reprinted at least nine times through the next decade, including later editions with additional content. The Tick&#x27;s sidekick, Arthur, was introduced in &quot;The Tick&quot; #4 (April 1989).

Spin-offs followed featuring characters such as Paul the Samurai, Man-Eating Cow, and Chainsaw Vigilante. Edlund continued to write and illustrate these projects initially through his years as an undergraduate film student at the Massachusetts College of Art. The &quot;Chainsaw Vigilante&quot; spin-off, which was never completed, was written and illustrated by Zander Cannon. Other series, such as the second &quot;Paul the Samurai&quot; series and the &quot;Man-Eating Cow&quot; series, were written by writer Clay Griffith.

In 1994, the Fox network introduced &quot;The Tick&quot; as a Saturday-morning cartoon series, which Edlund wrote and co-produced. Lasting three seasons, the animated series provided the Tick&#x27;s greatest mainstream fame. Townsend Coleman voiced the title character and Micky Dolenz played his sidekick Arthur, in season 1. Rob Paulsen took over the Arthur role during seasons 2 and 3. Due to issues relating to Standards and Practices, Edlund was not allowed to feature the comic series supporting cast characters in the cartoon, as characters such as Chainsaw Vigilante and Paul the Samurai were deemed inappropriate for a children&#x27;s television show. As such, new supporting cast characters such as Die Fledermaus (a Batman parody), American Maid (a Wonder Woman/Captain America parody), and Sewer Urchin (a parody of Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s character from &quot;Rain Man&quot;) were created instead. Edlund did not secure ownership rights to said characters, and they are now owned by the animated studio Saban, who made the series. They are therefore exclusive to the animated series continuity. Reruns on Comedy Central helped make the series a cult hit with adults. The 1997 book &quot;The Tick: Mighty Blue Justice!&quot; by Greg Hyland (creator of &quot;Lethargic Lad&quot;) was published as a tie-in with the animated series.

In 2001, Fox introduced a live-action TV series (produced by Columbia TriStar Television), written and executive produced by Edlund. The series starred Patrick Warburton as the Tick and David Burke as Arthur. Due to rights issues, original characters from the Fox cartoon series could not appear in the live action series; forcing Edlund to create similar characters: Nestor Carbonell as Batmanuel (a stand-in for Die Fledermaus) and Liz Vassey as Captain Liberty (a stand-in for American Maid). The series was short-lived, however, and it only lasted nine episodes. A DVD release of the complete series (including several unaired episodes) was released on September 30, 2003.

In June 2005, the Toon Disney network began airing &quot;The Tick&quot; animated series. The series also occasionally aired on ABC Family as part of the Jetix cartoon block. The following year, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;The Tick&quot; animated series on DVD. The second season was released on August 7, 2007; however, both collections were missing an episode for different reasons.

In July 2016, Amazon announced that a new live-action series, starring Peter Serafinowicz and directed by Wally Pfister, would air on Amazon Video. The pilot was picked up as a series, and the first season&#x27;s 12 episodes were released in two parts—the first six episodes on August 25, 2017, and the second half on February 23, 2018. A 10-episode second season was released on April 5, 2019.

==Fictional character biography==

The Tick seems to have no memory of his life before being the Tick, and indeed not much memory of anything; more than likely, this is due to frequent head injuries. Each media adaptation has a different origin of the Tick:

* In the original comic series, the Tick is apparently legally insane, having escaped from a mental institution near The City.
* In the 1994 animated series, he was assigned to protect The City after passing an official superhero initiation test.
* In the 2001 live-action series, the Tick was tricked into moving to (and protecting) The City after irritating the employees of a remote bus station he had sworn to protect. He has no memory of his life before that, although Batmanuel suggests that the Tick may be from space.
* In the 2016 live-action series, the Tick has no memory of where he comes from and his past was not explained or uncovered. It is implied he is a projection or guardian of some kind of his sidekick Arthur.

A square-jawed, muscular, bright blue-costumed figure with antennae sticking up from his head, the Tick is a surrealistic parody of superheroes, in the vein of Dave Sim&#x27;s character Cerebus the Aardvark. He is well-intended, friendly, childlike, good-natured, high-spirited, bombastic, frequently obtuse, and prone to quipping odd, dim remarks and &quot;inspirational&quot; speeches filled with bizarre metaphors. The Tick is known for his nonsensical battle cry, &quot;Spoooooon!&quot;, which he decided upon one day while eating a bowl of Drama Flakes cereal. Warburton described his perception of the Tick character, as Warburton played him:

Originally, the Tick&#x27;s costume was meant to be brown, but it was decided that blue looked better in print. In &quot;The Tick vs. The Tick&quot;, wherein the Tick is confronted by Barry, an unstable pseudo-hero who also calls himself &quot;the Tick&quot;, Barry wears a brown costume similar to the Tick&#x27;s. The Tick is named after an arachnid, much like Spider-Man.

In the comic series, the Tick gets a job at the &quot;Weekly World Planet&quot; newspaper. He works in the same office as Clark Oppenheimer, who is also a superhero called the Caped Wonder. Oppenheimer has all the typical Superman powers, including X-ray vision, super strength, invulnerability, flight, heat-vision, and super hearing. Consequently, he looks down on the Tick as a lower form of superhero with limited powers.

Like many superheroes, the Tick has a sidekick, a rather plump former accountant named Arthur. Arthur wears a white moth suit that allows him to fly; however, he is often mistaken for a bunny due to the long ear-like antennae of his costume and the fact that his wings are often folded up. The Tick is impulsive and Arthur serves as a sort of conscience. He also figures out the schemes of villains and formulates plans to stop them. Arthur&#x27;s &quot;battle cry&quot; is &quot;Not in the face! Not in the face!&quot;.

In all of his incarnations, the Tick is surrounded by a cast of equally absurd heroes and villains, many of them parodies of popular comic book characters and character types. Few of the &quot;superheroes&quot; in the Tick mythos have powers that measure up to those of DC Comics or Marvel Comics characters, but their foes are often equally silly or weak. The Tick lives in a city simply called &quot;The City&quot;. In the animated series, the Tick was assigned to the city after his &quot;Cabinet of Terror&quot; exploded, leaving him unharmed, during his city assignment selection trials at the National Super Institute Convention in Reno, Nevada.

==Powers and abilities==
The Tick possesses superhuman strength and mass, which makes him capable of inflicting great damage on his surroundings if he is not careful. His full strength is never actually quantified, although he is capable of lifting whole cars with a single hand and comfortably bending steel girders. In the pilot of the 2016 series, The Tick claims to have the strength of &quot;ten, perhaps twenty men—a crowded bus stop of men&quot;.

The Tick is also &quot;nigh-invulnerable&quot;, which means it is almost impossible to injure him in any serious way (although he is vulnerable to feelings of pain and his antennae are sensitive). Because of this he can survive moments of extreme stress, and has demonstrated this ability on numerous occasions. Several powerful supervillains have been able to knock the Tick unconscious in several fights, but he never comes to any lasting harm. He also does not possess a super-powered immune system, as he has been seen sick with the common cold just like a normal person. One of the Tick&#x27;s few limitations is that harming or removing his antennae will destroy his sense of balance.

Finally, the Tick possesses something referred to as &quot;drama power&quot;, or a tendency for the Tick&#x27;s powers to increase as the situation becomes more dramatic. He can also survive in space without a suit, and under water without oxygen for &quot;at least&quot; a long time.

==Reception==
The Tick has been well received as a comic book character. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked him as the 28th-greatest comic book character of all time, stating that the Tick is a lovable lunk, given to overly dramatic declarations on behalf of justice. IGN ranked him as the 57th-greatest comic book hero of all time, saying that if you like your heroes on the bizarre side, you won&#x27;t find anyone more surreal than the Tick. IGN also stated that whatever his mental state, the Tick&#x27;s adventures are thoroughly enjoyable on both the printed page and television. &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine rated him as the 187th-greatest comic book character of all time.

===Merchandising===

While &quot;The Tick&quot; comic book series included some extras, such as trading cards, the merchandising of The Tick increased dramatically with the launch of the animated series. Action figures, stickers, pogs, T-shirts, hats, party favors, costumes, and a board game were created. In addition, many fast food restaurant chains, such as Carl&#x27;s Jr. and Taco Bell offered Tick-related giveaways.

In 1994, Fox Interactive also released a video game based on the animated series. The game, however, was not well received.

<doc id="193344" wikidata="Q455754" url="?curid=193344" title="Screamin' Jay Hawkins">
<text>Jalacy J. &quot;Screamin&#x27; Jay&quot; Hawkins (July 18, 1929 – February 12, 2000) was an American singer-songwriter, musician, actor, film producer, and boxer. Famed chiefly for his powerful, shouting vocal delivery and wildly theatrical performances of songs such as &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, he sometimes used macabre props onstage, making him an early pioneer of shock rock. He received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his performance in the 1989 indie film &quot;Mystery Train&quot;.

==Early life==

Hawkins was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio. He had three older sisters, but his mother decided to put him into foster care. He grew up in the boarding house his foster mother owned. Hawkins studied classical piano as a child and learned guitar in his 20s. In a 1993 interview, Hawkins recounts telling his music tutor...to leave before I make your life miserable [...] because with the type of music I want to play. The things I want to do with music and don&#x27;t want to do it the old conventional way that everybody knows. I want to come up with my own ideas. I&#x27;ve got all the information that I need to get from you to do what I want, now if you stick around, I&#x27;m going to make your life miserable. His initial goal was to become an opera singer (Hawkins cited Paul Robeson as his musical idol in interviews), but when his initial ambitions failed, he began his career as a conventional blues singer and pianist. Other influences included Mario Lanza, Enrico Caruso, Lionel Hampton, Dizzy Gillespie, Charles Brown, Amos Milburn, Wynonie Harris, Nellie Lutcher, Roy Brown, Jimmy Witherspoon, Eddie &quot;Cleanhead&quot; Vinson, Roy Milton, Elmore James, Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and H-Bomb Ferguson.

Three months after World War II ended, he dropped out of East Technical High School and joined the US Army with a forged birth certificate (aged 16). He was stationed at Fort Bliss. During this time, he entertained the troops as part of his service. Hawkins was an avid boxer during his years in the US Army boxing circuit. He later claimed that he won several boxing titles; however, there is no record of his wins. He also told friends and reporters various embellished stories about attending Yale University and the University of Cincinnati Conservatory. Additionally, he claimed he fought in World War II and the Korean War and killed enemy combatants.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1951, Screamin’ Jay Hawkins began his career performing vocals and keyboards for Philadelphia guitarist Tiny Grimes, and was subsequently featured on some of Grimes&#x27; recordings. When Hawkins later went solo, his first single “Why Did You Waste My Time” was performed with accompaniment from Grimes’ band. In 1956, Hawkins signed with OKeh Records. When Hawkins became a solo performer, he often performed in a stylish wardrobe of leopard skins, red leather, and wild hats.

===&quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;===
Hawkins&#x27;s most successful recording, &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; (1956), was selected as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. According to the &quot;AllMusic Guide to the Blues&quot;, &quot;Hawkins originally envisioned the tune as a refined ballad.&quot; The entire band was intoxicated during a recording session where &quot;Hawkins screamed, grunted, and gurgled his way through the tune with utter drunken abandon.&quot; The resulting performance was no ballad but instead a &quot;raw, guttural track&quot; that became his greatest commercial success and reportedly surpassed a million copies in sales, although it failed to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop or R&amp;B charts.

Although Hawkins blacked out and was unable to remember the session, he relearned the song from the recorded version. Meanwhile, the record label released a second version of the single, removing most of the grunts that had embellished the original performance; this was in response to complaints about the recording&#x27;s overt sexuality. Nonetheless it was banned from radio in some areas. Furthermore, the recording attracted the ire of groups such as the NAACP, &quot;which worried that his act would reflect badly on African Americans.&quot; Hawkins later credited the uproar with a boost in sales due to the perceived taboo nature of his performances.

Soon after the release of &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, radio disc jockey Alan Freed offered Hawkins $300 to emerge from a coffin onstage. Hawkins initially declined, reportedly saying &quot;No black dude gets in a coffin alive – they don&#x27;t expect to get out!&quot; However, he later relented and soon created an outlandish stage persona in which performances began with the coffin and included &quot;gold and leopard-skin costumes and notable voodoo stage props, such as his smoking skull on a stick – named Henry – and rubber snakes.&quot; These props were suggestive of voodoo, but also presented with comic overtones that invited comparison to &quot;a black Vincent Price.&quot; Despite the commercial success of the gimmick, Hawkins resented the schlock-factor that made him famous. He found it exploitative, and believed it undermined his sincerity as a vocalist and a balladeer. In a 1973 interview, he bemoaned the Screamin&#x27; epithet given to him by his label Okeh records, saying &quot;If it were up to me, I wouldn&#x27;t be Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins... James Brown did an awful lot of screamin&#x27;, but never got called Screamin&#x27; James Brown... Why can&#x27;t people take me as a regular singer without making a bogeyman out of me?&quot;
&quot;I Put a Spell On You&quot; became a classic, covered by a variety of artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Nina Simone, Alan Price, The Animals, Them with Van Morrison, Arthur Brown, Bryan Ferry, Buddy Guy, Carlos Santana, Tim Curry, Leon Russell, Joe Cocker, Nick Cave, Marilyn Manson, Mica Paris, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, Joss Stone, Diamanda Galas, and Annie Lennox. Hawkins&#x27; original version was featured during the show and over the credits of the 2003 &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;I&#x27;m Spelling as Fast as I Can&quot;.

===Later career===

Hawkins&#x27; later releases included the toilet humor song &quot;Constipation Blues&quot; (which included a spoken introduction by Hawkins in which he states he wrote the song because no one had written a blues song before about &quot;real pain&quot;), &quot;Orange Colored Sky&quot;, and &quot;Feast of the Mau Mau&quot;. Nothing he released, however, had the monumental success of &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;. In Paris in 1999 and at the Taste of Chicago festival, he actually performed &quot;Constipation Blues&quot; with a toilet onstage.

He continued to tour and record through the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Europe, where he was very popular. Hawkins released a single recording of mainstream ballads in 1969, &quot;Too Many Teardrops&quot; and the Hawaiian styled &quot;Makaha Waves&quot; on the flip-side. In February 1976, he suffered facial injuries when he was burned by one of his flaming props while performing with his guitarist Mike Armando at the Virginia Theater in Alexandria, Virginia. He appeared in performance (as himself) in the Alan Freed bio-pic &quot;American Hot Wax&quot; in 1978. Subsequently, filmmaker Jim Jarmusch featured &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; on the soundtrack – and deep in the plot – of his film &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot; (1983), and then cast Hawkins himself as a hotel night clerk in his film &quot;Mystery Train&quot;. Hawkins also had acting roles in Álex de la Iglesia&#x27;s &quot;Perdita Durango&quot; and Bill Duke&#x27;s adaptation of Chester Himes&#x27; &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot;.

In 1983, Hawkins relocated to the New York area. In 1984 and 1985, Hawkins collaborated with garage rockers the Fuzztones, resulting in the album &quot;Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins and the Fuzztones Live&quot;, recorded at Irving Plaza in December 1984. They performed in the 1986 movie &quot;Joey&quot;.

In 1990, Hawkins performed the song &quot;Sirens Burnin&#x27;,&quot; which was featured in the 1990 horror film &quot;Night Angel&quot;.

In July 1991, Hawkins released his album &quot;Black Music for White People&quot;. The record features covers of two Tom Waits compositions: &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot; (which, later that year, was used in a European Levi&#x27;s advertisement without Waits&#x27; permission, resulting in a lawsuit), and &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; (a Waits original and not a cover of the John Brim classic). Hawkins also covered the Waits song &quot;Whistlin&#x27; Past the Graveyard&quot; on his album &quot;Somethin&#x27; Funny Goin&#x27; On&quot;. In 1993, his version of &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot; became his only UK hit, reaching No. 42 on the UK singles chart. In 1993, Hawkins moved to France.

When Dread Zeppelin recorded their &quot;disco&quot; album, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Unusual&quot; in 1992, producer Jah Paul Jo asked Hawkins to guest. He performed the songs &quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; and &quot;Disco Inferno&quot;. He also toured with the Clash and Nick Cave during this period, and not only became a fixture of blues festivals but appeared at many film festivals as well, including the Telluride Film Festival premiere of &quot;Mystery Train&quot;.

His 1957 single &quot;Frenzy&quot; (found on the early 1980s compilation of the same name) was included in the compilation CD, &quot;Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files&quot;, in 1996. This song was featured in the show&#x27;s Season 2 episode &quot;Humbug&quot;. It was also covered by the band Batmobile.

In 2001, the Greek director and writer Nicholas Triandafyllidis made the documentary &quot;Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins: I Put a Spell on Me&quot; about various stages of his life and career, including a filming of his final live performance, in Athens on December 11, 1999, two months before his death, following a performance the day before in Salonica. In the documentary notable artists such as Jim Jarmusch, Bo Diddley, Eric Burdon, Frank Ash, Arthur Brown and Michael Ochs talked about Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins&#x27; early life, personality and career, and about his incredible talent.

==Personal life==
From 1962 to 1971, Hawkins lived in Hawaii. He returned to New York after purchasing a home in Hawaii and establishing his own publishing company, sustained by the royalties from covers of &quot;I Put a Spell On You&quot;. Hawkins had six marriages; his last wife was 31 at his death. Singing partner Shoutin&#x27; Pat Newborn stabbed him in jealousy when he married Virginia Sabellona. He had three children with his first wife and claimed variously to have 57 or 75 children in total. After his death, his friend and biographer Maral Nigolian set up a website to trace these children, identifying 33, at least 12 of whom met at a 2001 reunion.

===Death===
Hawkins died after emergency surgery from an aneurysm on February 12, 2000, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, near Paris, at 70 years old.

==Influence==
Although Hawkins was not a major success as a recording artist, his highly theatrical performances from &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; onward earned him a steady career as a live performer for decades afterward, and influenced subsequent acts. He opened for Fats Domino, Tiny Grimes and the Rolling Stones. This exposure in turn influenced rock acts such as Alice Cooper, Tom Waits, the Cramps, Screaming Lord Sutch, Black Sabbath, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Arthur Brown, Led Zeppelin, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, and Glenn Danzig. Vox.com described Hawkins as a &quot;goth icon&quot;.

In the 2020 retrospective documentary mini series &quot;Red Dwarf: The First Three Million Years&quot;, Hawkins is identified as a key influence on Danny John-Jules&#x27; character Cat.

<text>The was a period in the history of Japan dating from 30 July 1912 to 25 December 1926, coinciding with the reign of Emperor Taishō. The new emperor was a sickly man, which prompted the shift in political power from the old oligarchic group of elder statesmen (or ) to the Imperial Diet of Japan and the democratic parties. Thus, the era is considered the time of the liberal movement known as Taishō Democracy; it is usually distinguished from the preceding chaotic Meiji era and the following militaristic-driven first part of the Shōwa era.

== Etymology ==
The two kanji characters in Taishō () were from a passage of the Classical Chinese &quot;I Ching&quot;: (Translated: &quot;Great prevalence is achieved through rectitude, and this is the Dao of Heaven.&quot;) The term could be roughly understood as meaning &quot;great rectitude&quot;, or &quot;great righteousness&quot;.

==Meiji legacy==


On 30 July 1912, Emperor Meiji died and Crown Prince Yoshihito succeeded to the throne as Emperor of Japan. In his coronation address, the newly enthroned Emperor announced his reign&#x27;s (era name) , meaning &quot;great righteousness&quot;.

The end of the Meiji period was marked by huge government, domestic, and overseas investments and defense programs, nearly exhausted credit, and a lack of foreign reserves to pay debts. The influence of Western culture experienced in the Meiji period also continued. Notable artists, such as Kobayashi Kiyochika, adopted Western painting styles while continuing to work in ukiyo-e; others, such as Okakura Kakuzō, kept an interest in traditional Japanese painting. Authors such as Mori Ōgai studied in the West, bringing back with them to Japan different insights on human life influenced by developments in the West.

The events following the Meiji Restoration in 1868 had seen not only the fulfillment of many domestic and foreign economic and political objectives—without Japan suffering the colonial fate of other Asian nations—but also a new intellectual ferment, in a time when there was worldwide interest in communism and socialism and an urban proletariat was developing. Universal male suffrage, social welfare, workers&#x27; rights, and nonviolent protests were ideals of the early leftist movement. Government suppression of leftist activities, however, led to more radical leftist action and even more suppression, resulting in the dissolution of the only a year after its founding and general failure of the socialist movement in 1906.

The beginning of the Taishō period was marked by the Taishō political crisis in 1912–13 that interrupted the earlier politics of compromise. When Saionji Kinmochi tried to cut the military budget, the army minister resigned, bringing down the Rikken Seiyūkai cabinet. Both Yamagata Aritomo and Saionji refused to resume office, and the were unable to find a solution. Public outrage over the military manipulation of the cabinet and the recall of Katsura Tarō for a third term led to still more demands for an end to politics. Despite old guard opposition, the conservative forces formed a party of their own in 1913, the , a party that won a majority in the House over the Seiyūkai in late 1914.

On February 12, 1913, Yamamoto Gonnohyōe succeeded Katsura as prime minister. In April 1914, Ōkuma Shigenobu replaced Yamamoto.

Crown Prince Yoshihito married Sadako Kujō on 10 May 1900. Their coronation took place on November 11, 1915.

==World War I and hegemony in China==


World War I permitted Japan, which fought on the side of the victorious Allied Powers, to expand its influence in Asia and its territorial holdings in the north equatorial Pacific. Japan declared war on Germany on August 23, 1914, and quickly occupied German-leased territories in China&#x27;s Shandong and the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall islands in the north Pacific Ocean. On November 7, Jiaozhou surrendered to Japan.

With its Western allies heavily involved in the war in Europe, Japan sought further to consolidate its position in China by presenting the Twenty-One Demands (; ) to the Government in January 1915. Besides expanding its control over German holdings, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, Japan also sought joint ownership of a major mining and metallurgical complex in central China, prohibitions on China&#x27;s ceding or leasing any coastal areas to a third power, and miscellaneous other political, economic and military controls, which, if achieved, would have reduced China to a Japanese protectorate. In the face of slow negotiations with the Chinese government, widespread anti-Japanese sentiment in China and international condemnation forced Japan to withdraw the final group of demands and treaties were signed in May of 1915.

Japan&#x27;s hegemony in northern China and other parts of Asia was facilitated through other international agreements. One with Russia in 1916 helped further secure Japan&#x27;s influence in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, and agreements with France, Britain, and the United States in 1917 recognized Japan&#x27;s territorial gains in China and the north Pacific. The Nishihara Loans (named after Nishihara Kamezo, Tokyo&#x27;s representative in Beijing) of 1917 and 1918, while aiding the Chinese government, put China still deeper into Japan&#x27;s debt. Toward the end of the war, Japan increasingly filled orders for its European allies&#x27; needed war material, thus helping to diversify the country&#x27;s industry, increase its exports, and transform Japan from a debtor to a creditor nation for the first time.

Japan&#x27;s power in Asia grew following the collapse of the Imperial Russian government in 1917 after the Russian Revolution. Wanting to seize the opportunity, the Japanese army planned to occupy Siberia as far west as Lake Baikal. To do so, Japan had to negotiate an agreement with China allowing the transit of Japanese troops through Chinese territory. Although the force was scaled back to avoid antagonizing the United States, more than 70,000 Japanese troops joined the much smaller units of the Allied expeditionary force sent to Siberia in July 1918 as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.

On October 9, 1916, Terauchi Masatake took over as prime minister from Ōkuma Shigenobu. On November 2, 1917, the Lansing–Ishii Agreement noted the recognition of Japan&#x27;s interests in China and pledges of keeping an . From July to September 1918, rice riots erupted due to increasing price of rice. The large scale rioting and collapse of public order led to the end of Terauchi Masatake government.

==Japan after World War I: Taishō Democracy==
The postwar era brought Japan unprecedented prosperity. Japan went to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference as one of the great military and industrial powers of the world and received official recognition as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; nations of the new international order. Tokyo was granted a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations and the peace treaty confirmed the transfer to Japan of Germany&#x27;s rights in Shandong, a provision that led to anti-Japanese riots and a mass political movement throughout China. Similarly, Germany&#x27;s former north Pacific islands were put under a Japanese mandate. Japan was also involved in the post-war Allied intervention in Russia and was the last Allied power to withdraw (doing so in 1925). Despite its small role in World War I and the Western powers&#x27; rejection of its bid for a racial equality clause in the peace treaty, Japan emerged as a major actor in international politics at the close of the war.

The two-party political system that had been developing in Japan since the turn of the century came of age after World War I, gave rise to the nickname for the period, &quot;Taishō Democracy&quot;. In 1918, Hara Takashi, a protégé of Saionji and a major influence in the prewar Seiyūkai cabinets, had become the first commoner to serve as prime minister. He took advantage of long-standing relationships he had throughout the government, won the support of the surviving and the House of Peers, and brought into his cabinet as army minister Tanaka Giichi, who had a greater appreciation of favorable civil-military relations than his predecessors. Nevertheless, major problems confronted Hara: inflation, the need to adjust the Japanese economy to postwar circumstances, the influx of foreign ideas, and an emerging labor movement. Prewar solutions were applied by the cabinet to these postwar problems, and little was done to reform the government. Hara worked to ensure a Seiyūkai majority through time-tested methods, such as new election laws and electoral redistricting, and embarked on major government-funded public works programs.

The public grew disillusioned with the growing national debt and the new election laws, which retained the old minimum tax qualifications for voters. Calls were raised for universal suffrage and the dismantling of the old political party network. Students, university professors, and journalists, bolstered by labor unions and inspired by a variety of democratic, socialist, communist, anarchist, and other Western schools of thought, mounted large but orderly public demonstrations in favor of universal male suffrage in 1919 and 1920. New elections brought still another Seiyūkai majority, but barely so. In the political milieu of the day, there was a proliferation of new parties, including socialist and communist parties.

In the midst of this political ferment, Hara was assassinated by a disenchanted railroad worker in 1921. Hara was followed by a succession of nonparty prime ministers and coalition cabinets. Fear of a broader electorate, left-wing power, and the growing social change engendered by the influx of Western popular culture together led to the passage of the Peace Preservation Law in 1925, which forbade any change in the political structure or the abolition of private property.

In 1921, during the Interwar period, Japan developed and launched the , which was the first purpose-designed aircraft carrier in the world. Japan subsequently developed a fleet of aircraft carriers that was second to none.

Unstable coalitions and divisiveness in the Diet led the and the to merge as the in 1927. The platform was committed to the parliamentary system, democratic politics, and world peace. Thereafter, until 1932, the and the alternated in power.The two-party system during this period is called &quot;Established practices in constitutional politics(憲政の常道, Kensei no Jodo)&quot;.

Despite the political realignments and hope for more orderly government, domestic economic crises plagued whichever party held power. Fiscal austerity programs and appeals for public support of such conservative government policies as the Peace Preservation Law—including reminders of the moral obligation to make sacrifices for the emperor and the state—were attempted as solutions. While the impact of the American panic of October 1929 was still reverberating throughout the world, the Japanese government lifted the gold embargo at the old parity in January 1930. These two blows struck the Japanese economy simultaneously, and the country was plunged into a severe depression. There was a sense of rising discontent that was heightened with the assault upon prime minister Osachi Hamaguchi in 1930. Though Hamaguchi survived the attack and tried to continue in office despite the severity of his wounds, he was forced to resign the following year and died not long afterwards.

==Communism and socialism and the Japanese response==
The victory of the Bolsheviks in Russia in 1922 and their hopes for a world revolution led to the establishment of the Comintern. The Comintern realized the importance of Japan in achieving successful revolution in East Asia and actively worked to form the Japanese Communist Party, which was founded in July 1922. The announced goals of the Japanese Communist Party in 1923 included the unification of the working class as well as farmers, recognition of the Soviet Union, and withdrawal of Japanese troops from Siberia, Sakhalin, China, Korea, and Taiwan. In the coming years, authorities tried to suppress the party, especially after the Toranomon Incident when a radical student under the influence of Japanese Marxist thinkers tried to assassinate Prince Regent Hirohito. The 1925 Peace Preservation Law was a direct response to the perceived &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot; perpetrated by communist and socialist elements in Japan.

The liberalization of election laws with the General Election Law in 1925 benefited communist candidates, even though the Japan Communist Party itself was banned. A new Peace Preservation Law in 1928, however, further impeded communist efforts by banning the parties they had infiltrated. The police apparatus of the day was ubiquitous and quite thorough in attempting to control the socialist movement. By 1926, the Japan Communist Party had been forced underground, by the summer of 1929 the party leadership had been virtually destroyed, and by 1933 the party had largely disintegrated.

Pan-Asianism was characteristic of right-wing politics and conservative militarism since the inception of the Meiji Restoration, contributing greatly to the pro-war politics of the 1870s. Disenchanted former samurai had established patriotic societies and intelligence-gathering organizations, such as the and its later offshoot, the . These groups became active in domestic and foreign politics, helped foment pro-war sentiments, and supported ultra-nationalist causes through the end of World War II. After Japan&#x27;s victories over China and Russia, the ultra-nationalists concentrated on domestic issues and perceived domestic threats such as socialism and communism.

==Taishō foreign policy==
Emerging Chinese nationalism, the victory of the communists in Russia, and the growing presence of the United States in East Asia all worked against Japan&#x27;s postwar foreign policy interests. The four-year Siberian expedition and activities in China, combined with big domestic spending programs, had depleted Japan&#x27;s wartime earnings. Only through more competitive business practices, supported by further economic development and industrial modernization, all accommodated by the growth of the , could Japan hope to become dominant in Asia. The United States, long a source of many imported goods and loans needed for development, was seen as becoming a major impediment to this goal because of its policies of containing Japanese imperialism.

An international turning point in military diplomacy was the Washington Conference of 1921–22, which produced a series of agreements that effected a new order in the Pacific region. Japan&#x27;s economic problems made a naval buildup nearly impossible and, realizing the need to compete with the United States on an economic rather than a military basis, rapprochement became inevitable. Japan adopted a more neutral attitude toward the civil war in China, dropped efforts to expand its hegemony into China proper, and joined the United States, Britain, and France in encouraging Chinese self-development.

In the Four-Power Treaty on Insular Possessions signed on December 13, 1921, Japan, the United States, Britain, and France agreed to recognize the status quo in the Pacific, and Japan and Britain agreed to formally terminate the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The Washington Naval Treaty, signed on February 6, 1922, established an international capital ship ratio for the United States, Britain, Japan, France, and Italy (5, 5, 3, 1.75, and 1.75, respectively) and limited the size and armaments of capital ships already built or under construction. In a move that gave the Japanese Imperial Navy greater freedom in the Pacific Ocean, Washington and London agreed not to build any new military bases between Singapore and Hawaii.

The goal of the Nine-Power Treaty also signed on February 6, 1922, by Belgium, China, the Netherlands, and Portugal, along with the original five powers, was to prevent a war in the Pacific. The signatories agreed to respect China&#x27;s independence and integrity, not to interfere in Chinese attempts to establish a stable government, to refrain from seeking special privileges in China or threatening the positions of other nations there, to support a policy of equal opportunity for commerce and industry of all nations in China, and to reexamine extraterritoriality and tariff autonomy. Japan also agreed to withdraw its troops from Shandong, relinquishing all but purely economic rights there, and to evacuate its troops from Siberia.

==End of the Taishō Democracy==
Overall, during the 1920s, Japan changed its direction toward a democratic system of government. However, parliamentary government was not rooted deeply enough to withstand the economic and political pressures of the 1930s, during which military leaders became increasingly influential. These shifts in power were made possible by the ambiguity and imprecision of the Meiji Constitution, particularly regarding the position of the Emperor in relation to the constitution.

<text>Gengowas a web-based translation platform headquartered in Tokyo.

==History==
Gengo was founded in 2008 by Matthew Romaine and Robert Laing. Prior to starting Gengo, Romaine was an audio research engineer and translator with Sony Corporation, and Laing headed Moresided, a UK-based design agency. Romaine thought of the concept for Gengo due to his experience being asked to translate documents in Japanese and English at Sony, despite originally being hired as an engineer. Prior to its early 2012 rebranding, the company was known as &quot;myGengo.&quot;

In April 2010, the company launched their API, allowing developers to integrate Gengo’s translation platform into third-party applications, web sites and widgets.

Romaine initially served as CTO of the company. He replaced fellow co-founder Robert Laing as CEO in 2015.

In March 2018, the company launched Gengo AI, an on-demand platform that provides crowdsourced multilingual training data to machine learning developers. 

In January 2019, Gengo and Gengo AI were acquired by Lionbridge Technologies and is being rebranded to Lionbridge AI.

==Funding==
The company&#x27;s initial $750,000 seed investment round concluded in September 2010. Investors included Dave McClure of 500 Startups, last.fm founder Felix Miller, Delicious founder Joshua Schachter, Brian Nelson (CEO at Japan-based ValueCommerce), Pageflakes co-founder Christoph Janz, Benjamin Joffe (CEO at China-based Plus Eight Star), and a number of Japanese angel investors. This was followed by a further seed funding round of around $1,000,000 in mid-2011.

A $5.25 million Series A round led by Atomico and joined by 500 Startups ended in September 2011, followed by an early 2013 Series B investment of $12 million led by Intel Capital.

The company announced its $5.4 million Series C round funding in April 2015.

<text>Oskar Merikanto (; born Frans Oskar Ala-Kanto; 5 August 186817 February 1924) was a Finnish composer, music critic, pianist, and organist.

As a composer, Merikanto was primarily a miniaturist, and includes songs and piano pieces (he wrote over 100 of each). Of the latter, he is best remembered for: &quot;Summer Evening Waltz&quot; (, Op. 1), &quot;Romance&quot; (, Op. 12), &quot;Summer Evening Idyll&quot; (, Op. 16/2), (Op. 33), and &quot;Idyll&quot; (, Op. 73/1). Merikanto also wrote three operas: &quot;The Maiden of the North&quot; (, 1898), which retains a degree of historical significance as the first opera composed to a Finnish libretto; &quot;The Death of Elina&quot; (, 1910); and &quot;Regina von Emmeritz&quot; (1920). However, Merikanto&#x27;s operas have entered neither the domestic nor the international repertoires.

As a music critic, Merikanto was associated with the Finnish-language, liberal, nationalist newspaper &quot;Päivälehti&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born in Helsinki, the son of Frans Ferdinand Ala-Kanto (his surname is also reported as Aittomäki) from Jalasjärvi, South Ostrobothnia and Anna Helena Merikanto (). Frans got a Swedish-language surname, Mattsson, when he joined the Finnish army. His father had changed the family name from Ala-Kanto to Merikanto in 1882. &quot;Meri&quot; means &quot;sea&quot; and refers to his voyage from Vaasa to Helsinki; &quot;Kanto&quot; refers to his origins from the estate Kanto.
He studied for some time at the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany, where his teachers were Carl Reinecke, Theodor Coccius, Robert Papperitz, Willy Rechenberg and Gustav Schreck.

He was notable for his variety of talents – he gave concerts all around Finland, performing on the piano and organ, conducting orchestras, and composing original music. Some of his most beloved compositions are &quot;Där björkarna susa&quot;, the waltz &quot;Kesäilta&quot; (&quot;Summer Evening Waltz&quot;) and the Valse lente, Op. 33.

Merikanto&#x27;s style is reminiscent of Finnish folk songs, but has its basis in Italian bel canto.

He died in Hausjärvi-Oitti.

===Personal life===
He married Elise &quot;Liisa&quot; Häyrynen in 1892. They had one son, Aarre Merikanto, a noted Finnish composer.

<doc id="193362" wikidata="Q1047492" url="?curid=193362" title="Minamitorishima">
<text>(pronounced: []) sometimes Minami-Tori-shima or Minami-Torishima, also known as Marcus Island, is an isolated Japanese coral atoll in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, located some southeast of Tokyo and east of the closest Japanese island, South Iwo Jima of the Volcano Islands, and nearly on a straight line between mainland Tokyo and Wake Island, further to the east-southeast. The closest island to Minamitorishima is East Island in the Mariana Islands, which is to the west-southwest.

It is the easternmost territory belonging to Japan, and the only Japanese territory on the Pacific Plate, past the Japan Trench. Although small (), it is of strategic importance, as it enables Japan to claim a exclusive economic zone in the surrounding waters. It is also the easternmost territory of Tokyo, being administratively part of Ogasawara Subprefecture. No civilians live there, except personnel of the Japan Meteorological Agency, Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), and Japan Coast Guard serving temporary tours of duty on the island.

==Access==
The island is off limits to civilians except for Japan Meteorological Agency staff, although reporters, documentary makers, and scientific researchers can sometimes get an entry permit. No commercial boat tours or flights visit the island, and civilians are currently not allowed access to Minamitorishima for tours or sightseeing, due to its use by the JSDF as an observation station.

==Geography and geology==

Minamitorishima is very remote. There is no other land for over in any direction.

The island is triangular in shape, and has a saucer-like profile, with a raised outer rim of between above sea level. The central area of the island is below sea level. Minamitorishima is surrounded by fringing reefs, which range from in width, enclosing a shallow lagoon, which is connected with the open ocean by narrow passages on the southern and northeastern sides.

Outside the reef, the ocean depths quickly plunge to over . The island has a total land area of . It takes about 45 minutes to walk around the island.

The sea is clear in the shallow area around Minamitorishima. At night, no light pollution occurs, so rarely noticed stars are clearly visible in the sky.

The island does not have soil adequate to produce substantial crops, so food is brought in by supply ships and planes. The only food grown on the island is papaya, mustard greens, and coconuts, and saltwater fish are caught offshore.

=== Minamitorishima area rare-earth deposits ===
After China restricted exports of strategic rare-earth oxides (REOs) in 2009, Japan started to explore its seabeds for deposits.

In January 2013, a deep-sea research vessel of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology obtained seven deep-sea mud core samples from the seafloor at 5,600 to 5,800 m depth, about south of the island. The research team found a mud layer beneath the seabed that is extremely concentrated in REO. Analytical results showed that the maximum REO content in the mud was up to 0.66%.

In 2018 a scientific study of the seabed mud resulted in an estimate of 16 million tons of REO mineralised sediments within the studied area. The calculated rare-earth element and yttrium content for the research area was more than 16 million tons (average = 964 ppm).

==Wildlife==
A species in the gecko family Gekkonidae, &quot;Perochirus ateles&quot;, inhabits the island. In Japan, these are only found in Minamitorishima and South Iwo Jima. They are thought to have arrived from Micronesia on driftwood. 

Also, a large number of land snails, &quot;Achatina fulica&quot;, have parasites that are harmful to humans. Various forms of marine life inhabit the ocean around the island, including sea snakes, tuna, sharks, and some rare fish. Small fish are in the shallow area around the island.

==Population==
No local residents live on Minamitorishima. Civilians are not allowed to reside there, and the personnel of the Japan Meteorological Agency, JSDF, and the Japan Coast Guard, only serve on the island for a limited time, and in limited numbers.

==History==
===First known sightings===
The first discovery and mention of an island in this area was made by a Spanish Manila galleon captain, Andrés de Arriola, in 1694. It was charted in Spanish maps as &quot;Sebastián López&quot;, after Spanish Admiral Sebastián López, victorious in the battles of La Naval de Manila in 1646 against the Dutch. Its exact location was left unrecorded until further sightings in the 19th century.

Captain Bourn Russell (1794–1880) in the &quot;Lady Rowena&quot; departed Sydney, NSW, 2 November 1830 on a Pacific whaling voyage. On his return on 27 June 1832, he reported an island, not on his charts, which he named &quot;William the Fourth&#x27;s Island&quot;. The &quot;Sydney Herald&quot; reported Russell&#x27;s description of the size, shape, and orientation of the island and its reef, but misspelled his name and gave the island a Southern Hemisphere latitude.

The island was sighted again on 16 December 1864 by Captain Charles Gelett of the Hawaiian Evangelical Association&#x27;s missionary ship &quot;Morning Star&quot;, and was called &quot;Weeks Island&quot; by him. Its position was recorded by a United States survey ship in 1874 and first sighted by a Japanese national, Kiozaemon Saito, in 1879.

===Colonization and sovereignty contention===
On 30 June 1886, Japanese explorer (水谷新六, 1850-1921) led a group of 46 colonists from Haha-jima in the Bonin Islands to settle on Marcus Island. The settlement was named &quot;Mizutani&quot; after the leader of the expedition. The Empire of Japan officially annexed the island 24 July 1898, the previous United States claim from 1889 according to the Guano Islands Act not being officially acknowledged. The island was officially named &quot;Minamitorishima&quot; and placed administratively under the Ogasawara Subprefecture of Tokyo (&quot;Tōkyō-fu&quot;). 

Sovereignty over the island before World War I was apparently disputed, as various sources from the time move the island from the American to Japanese domain without specific explanation. In 1902, the United States dispatched a warship from Hawaii to enforce its claims, but withdrew on finding the island still inhabited by Japanese, with a Japanese warship patrolling nearby. In 1914, William D. Boyce included Marcus Island as an obviously American island in his book, &quot;The Colonies and Dependencies of the United States&quot;. In 1933, by orders of the Japanese government, the civilian inhabitants of Minamitorishima were evacuated. In 1935, the Imperial Japanese Navy established a meteorological station on the island and built an airstrip.

===World War II===

After the start of World War II, the Japanese garrison stationed on the island consisted of the 742-man Minamitorishima Guard Unit, under the command of Rear Admiral Masata Matsubara, and the 2,005-man 12th Independent Mixed Regiment of the Imperial Japanese Army, under the command of Colonel Yoshiichi Sakata. The United States Navy bombed it repeatedly in 1942 and in 1943, but never attempted to capture it (the island was featured in the U.S. film &quot;The Fighting Lady&quot;). Japan was able to resupply the garrison by submarine, using a channel, still visible today, cut through the reef on the northwest side of the island. The island was subject to repeated U.S. air attacks during World War II, and finally surrendered when the destroyer arrived on 31 August 1945.

===U.S. occupation===

The Treaty of San Francisco transferred the island to American control in 1952. The island was returned to Japanese control in 1968, but the Americans retained control of the airstrip and LORAN-C station. 

In 1964, after some delays caused by storms that ravaged the island during construction, the U.S. Coast Guard opened a LORAN-C navigation station on Minamitorishima, whose mast was until 1985 one of the tallest structures in the Pacific area at . Before replacing Loran A for general marine navigation, Loran C was used by submarine-launched Polaris missile systems and the existence and location of Loran C stations was classified. LORANSTA Marcus Island was billeted for 23 U.S. Coast Guard personnel. The commissioning commanding officer was U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Louis. C. Snell. A detachment of SeaBees remained on the island for several months making repairs to the island&#x27;s airstrip. 

The island is extremely isolated. Coast guardsmen stationed on the island served one-year tours that were later modified to allow an R&amp;R visit to mainland Japan at the six-month point. At the end of this isolated tour of duty, crew members received an additional 30 days of compensatory leave. 

While under U.S. administration, a C-130 Hercules from the 345th Tactical Airlift Squadron, Yokota Air Base, Japan, resupplied the island on missions every Thursday. Coast guardsmen often amused themselves by judging aircraft landings, raising placards painted with large numbers. An unusually long four-hour ground time was scheduled to allow technicians who flew in to perform maintenance on the transmitter and to offload extra fuel from the C-130 to power the island&#x27;s generator. It also allowed the coast guardsmen to read and answer letters while aircrews snorkeled and collected green glass fishing buoys that had washed up on the shore. During the Vietnam war era, the weekly log flight was a DC-6 flight conducted by the CIA-operated &quot;Air America.&quot;

===Resumed Japanese administration===
The Marcus Island station was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) on 30 September 1993 and was closed on 1 December 2009. 

The island is currently used for weather observation and has a radio station, but little else. The JMSDF garrison was supplied by C-130s from Iruma Air Base, or by C-130s from Haneda or Atsugi Air Base with flights via Iwo Jima on a weekly basis. The runway of Minami Torishima Airport is only long and cannot handle large aircraft.

==Climate==
Minamitorishima has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), with warm to hot temperatures throughout the year. The wettest months are July and August, while the driest months are February and March. It has the highest average temperature in Japan of . Temperature extremes range from on February 10, 1976 to on July 17, 1951.

<doc id="193365" wikidata="Q1914318" url="?curid=193365" title="Maxwell Bodenheim">
<text>Maxwell &quot;Bogey&quot; Bodenheim (May 26, 1892 – February 6, 1954) was an American poet and novelist. A literary figure in Chicago, he later went to New York where he became known as the King of Greenwich Village Bohemians. His writing brought him international notoriety during the Jazz Age of the 1920s.

==Early life==
Born Maxwell Bodenheimer in Hermanville, Mississippi, he was the son of Jewish parents, Solomon Bodenheimer (born July 1858) and Carrie (born April 1860). His father was born in Germany and his mother in Alsace-Lorraine. Carrie emigrated to the United States in 1881 and Solomon in 1888. 

In 1900, the family moved from Mississippi to Chicago. The Federal census gave their residence as 431 46th Street, Chicago..

==Work==
The young Bodenheim and the even younger writer Ben Hecht met in Chicago and became literary friends about 1912. (At the time, Bodenheim was nicknamed &quot;Bogey.&quot; The nickname was also applied in his later years in Greenwich Village). They co-founded &quot;The Chicago Literary Times&quot; (1923–1924). Contributors included Carl Sandburg, Theodore Dreiser, Edgar Lee Masters, Witter Bynner, Arthur Davison Ficke, Floyd Dell, Vachel Lindsay and Sherwood Anderson.

Bodenheim was a co-founder alongside sculptor and dancer Lou Wall Moore, of “The Shop,” a bohemian social club in Chicago.

Bodenheim published his earliest verse in the groundbreaking &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine in 1914. A poem by Bodenheim was featured in the 1917 &quot;Others: An Anthology of the New Verse&quot;, which included poems by such future luminaries as T. S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Carl Sandburg, William Carlos Williams, and Wallace Stevens. While the poet was living in New York City, he became an active member of the Raven Poetry Circle of Greenwich Village.

Over the next ten years, he established himself as a leading American author, publishing ten books of verse, which incorporate many techniques of the imagists, and 13 novels. His poetry books include &quot;Minna and Myself&quot; (1918), &quot;Advice&quot; (1920), &quot;Against This Age&quot; (1923), &quot;The King of Spain&quot; (1928), &quot;Bringing Jazz!&quot; (1930) and &quot;Selected Poems 1914–1944&quot; (1946).

Bodenheim&#x27;s novels include &quot;Blackguard&quot; (1923), &quot;Replenishing Jessica&quot; (1925), &quot;Ninth Avenue&quot; (1926), &quot;Georgia May&quot; (1927), &quot;Naked on Roller Skates&quot; (1930) and &quot;A Virtuous Girl&quot; (1930). His 1933 novel &quot;New York Madness&quot; was reissued in 2024 by Tough Poets Press.

Critic John Strausbaugh suggests that Bodenheim had &quot;a real talent for scandal, easy enough to generate during Greenwich Village&#x27;s prolonged drunken orgy in the Prohibition years.&quot; Strausbaugh notes that Bodenheim&#x27;s &quot;haughty, insulting demeanor, and his habit of trying to steal other men&#x27;s women right under their noses, got him regularly socked on the jaw and thrown out of bars, soirees and the fauxhemian revels at Webster Hall.&quot; For many years a leading figure of the Bohemian scene in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, Bodenheim deteriorated rapidly after his success in the 1920s and 1930s.

==Personal life and death==

=== Marriages ===
Bodenheim had three wives. His first wife was Minna Schein (married 1918-divorced 1938), with whom he had one son, Solbert, born 1920. His second wife was Grace Finan (married 1939-her death 1950). After becoming a widower, he married Ruth Fagin (married 1952–until their murder in 1954).

Before he married his second wife, Grace, he had become a panhandler. They spent part of their marriage in the Catskills. After she died of cancer in 1950, he was arrested and hospitalized several times for vagrancy and drunkenness .
Ruth Fagin, 28 years his junior, shared his derelict lifestyle. They were homeless and slept on park benches. He sometimes panhandled while carrying a sign that read, &quot;I Am Blind,&quot; although he had adequate vision. He sometimes composed short poems for money or drinks. Ruth engaged in prostitution, which reportedly provoked beatings by her husband. In approximately 1953, Bodenheim and Ruth spent some time (perhaps two months) as guests of the Catholic Worker of Dorothy Day in New York. Day had been a friend of Bodenheim in Greenwich Village in the 1920s. She devoted a chapter to the Bodenheims in her &quot;Loaves and Fishes&quot; (1963).

=== Death ===
Bodenheim and Ruth were murdered February 6, 1954, at a flophouse at 97 Third Avenue in Manhattan, by a 25-year-old dishwasher, Harold &quot;Charlie&quot; Weinberg. They had befriended him on the streets of the Village and he offered to let them spend the night in his room a few blocks from the Bowery. Weinberg and Ruth had sex near the cot where the 62-year-old drunken Bodenheim appeared to be sleeping. Bodenheim arose, challenged Weinberg, and they began fighting. Weinberg shot Bodenheim twice in the chest. He beat Ruth and stabbed her four times in the back. Weinberg confessed to the double homicide, but said in his defense, &quot;I ought to get a medal. I killed two Communists.&quot; Weinberg was judged insane (sociopathic) and sent to a mental institution.

Hecht offered to pay for Bodenheim&#x27;s funeral. Bodenheim&#x27;s ex-wife, Minna Schein, made arrangements to have him buried in her family plot in Cedar Park Cemetery, Emerson, New Jersey.

==Legacy==
*Bodenheim&#x27;s memoir, &quot;My Life and Loves in Greenwich Village&quot;, released six months after his death in 1954, was largely ghostwritten by David George Plotkin, a writer employed by the publisher Samuel Roth. Roth had been paying the down-and-out Bodenheim for his biographical stories about Greenwich Village at the time of the writer&#x27;s murder. 
*Hecht based his 1958 play &quot;Winkelberg&quot; on the life of the bohemian poet.
*Three official full biographies have been published on Maxwell Bodenheim: a doctoral dissertation by Edward T. Devoe, &quot;A Soul in Gaudy Tatters&quot;, University of Pennsylvania (1957); &quot;Maxwell Bodenheim&quot; (1970) by Jack B. Moore; and a doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Necessity of Rebellion: The Novels of Maxwell Bodenheim&quot; (1975) by Arthur B. Sacks, University of Wisconsin-Madison.
*A substantial collection of his journalism was published in 2024 by Tough Poets Press under the title &quot;Bughouse Dope: Selected Essays &amp; Articles,&quot; edited and with an introduction by Paul Maher Jr.

<doc id="193366" wikidata="Q16530385" url="?curid=193366" title="Asafoetida">
<text>Asafoetida (; also spelled asafetida) is the dried latex (gum oleoresin) exuded from the rhizome or tap root of several species of &quot;Ferula&quot;, perennial herbs of the carrot family. It is produced in Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, northern India and Northwest China (Xinjiang). Different regions have different botanical sources.

Asafoetida has a pungent smell, as reflected in its name, lending it the common name of &quot;stinking gum&quot;. The odour dissipates upon cooking; in cooked dishes, it delivers a smooth flavour reminiscent of leeks or other onion relatives. Asafoetida is also known colloquially as &quot;devil&#x27;s dung&quot; in English (and similar expressions in many other languages).

==Etymology and other names==
The English name is derived from &quot;asa&quot;, a Latinised form of Persian &#x27;mastic&#x27;, and Latin &#x27;stinky&#x27;.

Other names include, with its pungent odour having resulted in many unpleasant names:
==Composition==
Typical asafoetida contains about 40–64% resin, 25% endogeneous gum, 10–17% volatile oil, and 1.5–10% ash. The resin portion contains asaresinotannols A and B, ferulic acid, umbelliferone, and four unidentified compounds. The volatile oil component is rich in various organosulfide compounds, such as 2-butyl-propenyl-disulfide, diallyl sulfide, diallyl disulfide (also present in garlic) and dimethyl trisulfide, which is also responsible for the odour of cooked onions. The organosulfides are primarily responsible for the odour and flavour of asafoetida.

== Botanical sources ==
Many &quot;Ferula&quot; species are utilised as the sources of asafoetida. Most of them are characterised by abundant sulphur-containing compounds in the essential oil.
*&quot;Ferula foetida&quot; is the source of asafoetida in Eastern Iran, western Afghanistan, western Pakistan and Central Asia (Karakum Desert, Kyzylkum Desert). It is one of the most widely distributed asafoetida-producing species and often mistaken for &quot;F. assa-foetida&quot;. It has sulphur-containing compounds in the essential oil.
*&quot;Ferula assa-foetida&quot; is endemic to Southern Iran and is the source of asafoetida there. It has sulphur-containing compounds in the essential oil. Although it is often considered the main source of asafoetida on the international market, this notion is attributable to the fact that several &quot;Ferula&quot; species acting as the major sources are often misidentified as &quot;F. assa-foetida&quot;. In fact, the production of asafoetida from &quot;F. assa-foetida&quot; is confined to its native range, namely Southern Iran, outside which the sources of asafoetida are other species.
*&quot;Ferula pseudalliacea&quot; and &quot;Ferula rubricaulis&quot; are endemic to western and southwestern Iran. They are sometimes considered conspecific with &quot;F. assa-foetida&quot;.
*&quot;Ferula lutensis&quot; and &quot;Ferula alliacea&quot; are the sources of asafoetida in Eastern Iran. They have sulphur-containing compounds in the essential oil.
*&quot;Ferula latisecta&quot; is the source of asafoetida in Eastern Iran and southern Turkmenistan. It has sulphur-containing compounds in the essential oil.
*&quot;Ferula sinkiangensis&quot; and &quot;Ferula fukanensis&quot; are endemic to Xinjiang, China. They are the sources of asafoetida in China. They have sulphur-containing compounds in the essential oil.
*&quot;Ferula narthex&quot; is native to Afghanistan, northern Pakistan and Kashmir. Although it is often listed as the source of asafoetida, one report states that it lacks sulphur-containing compounds in the essential oil.

==Uses==
===Cooking===
This spice is used as a digestive aid, in food as a condiment, and in pickling. It plays a critical flavouring role in Indian vegetarian cuisine by acting as a savory enhancer. Used along with turmeric, it is a standard component of lentil curries, such as dal, chickpea curries, and vegetable dishes, especially those based on potato and cauliflower. Asafoetida is quickly heated in hot oil before it is sprinkled on the food. It is sometimes used to harmonise sweet, sour, salty, and spicy components in food. The spice is added to the food as it&#x27;s tempered.

In its pure form, it is sold in the form of chunks of resin, small quantities of which are scraped off for use. The odour of the pure resin is so strong that the pungent smell will contaminate other spices stored nearby if it is not stored in an airtight container.

When adapting recipes for those with garlic allergy or intolerance, asafoetida can be used as a substitute.

==Cultivation and manufacture==

The resin-like gum comes from the dried sap extracted from the stem and roots, and is used as a spice. The resin is greyish-white when fresh, but dries to a dark amber colour. The asafoetida resin is difficult to grate and is traditionally crushed between stones or with a hammer. Today, the most commonly available form is compounded asafoetida, a fine powder containing 30% asafoetida resin, along with rice flour or &quot;maida&quot; (white wheat flour) and gum arabic.

&quot;Ferula assa-foetida&quot; is a monoecious, herbaceous, perennial plant of the family Apiaceae. It grows to high, with a circular mass of leaves. Stem leaves have wide sheathing petioles. Flowering stems are high and thick and hollow, with a number of ducts in the cortex containing the resinous gum. Flowers are pale greenish yellow produced in large compound umbels. Fruits are oval, flat, thin, reddish brown and have a milky juice. Roots are thick, massive, and pulpy. They yield a resin similar to that of the stems. All parts of the plant have the distinctive fetid smell.

==History==
Asafoetida was familiar in the early Mediterranean, having come by land across Iran. It was brought to Europe by an expedition of Alexander the Great, who, after returning from a trip to northeastern ancient Persia, thought that he had found a plant almost identical to the famed silphium of Cyrene in North Africa—though less tasty. Dioscorides, in the first century, wrote, &quot;the Cyrenaic kind, even if one just tastes it, at once arouses a humour throughout the body and has a very healthy aroma, so that it is not noticed on the breath, or only a little; but the Median [Iranian] is weaker in power and has a nastier smell.&quot; Nevertheless, it could be substituted for silphium in cooking, which was fortunate, because a few decades after Dioscorides&#x27; time, the true silphium of Cyrene became extinct, and asafoetida became more popular amongst physicians, as well as cooks.

Asafoetida is also mentioned numerous times in Jewish literature, such as the Mishnah. Maimonides also writes in the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; &quot;In the rainy season, one should eat warm food with much spice, but a limited amount of mustard and asafoetida [ ].&quot;

While it is generally forgotten now in Europe, it is widely used in India. Asafoetida is mentioned in the Bhagavata Purana (7:5:23-24), which states that one must not have eaten hing before worshipping the deity. Asafoetida is eaten by Brahmins and Jains. Devotees of the Hare Krishna movement also use hing in their food, as they are not allowed to consume onions or garlic. Their food has to be presented to Lord Krishna for sanctification (to become Prasadam) before consumption and onions and garlic cannot be offered to Krishna.

Asafoetida was described by a number of Arab and Islamic scientists and pharmacists. Avicenna discussed the effects of asafoetida on digestion. Ibn al-Baitar and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi described some positive medicinal effects on the respiratory system.

After the fall of Rome and until the 16th century, asafoetida was rare in Europe, and if ever encountered, it was viewed as a medicine. &quot;If used in cookery, it would ruin every dish because of its dreadful smell&quot;, asserted Garcia de Orta&#x27;s European guest. &quot;Nonsense&quot;, Garcia replied, &quot;nothing is more widely used in every part of India, both in medicine and in cookery.&quot; 

During the Italian Renaissance, asafoetida was used as part of the exorcism ritual.

<text>USS &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; (CL/CA-25) of the United States Navy was a , later reclassified as a heavy cruiser, sometimes known as &quot;Swayback Maru&quot; or &quot;Old Swayback&quot;. She had 11 battle stars for the eleven engagements she participated in. She was also the first ship to be named after Salt Lake City, Utah.

She was laid down on 9 June 1927, by the American Brown Boveri Electric Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, at Camden, New Jersey; launched on 23 January 1929, sponsored by Helen Budge, a granddaughter of leading Mormon missionary William Budge; and commissioned on 11 December 1929, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, Captain Frederick Lansing Oliver in command.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; departed Philadelphia on 20 January 1930, for shakedown trials off the Maine coast. She began her first extended cruise on 10 February; visited Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; Culebra, Virgin Islands; Rio de Janeiro and Bahia, Brazil; then returned to Guantanamo Bay, where—on 31 March—she joined Cruiser Division 2 (CruDiv 2) of the Scouting Force. With this division, she operated along the New England coast until 12 September, when she was reassigned to CruDiv 5. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; then operated off New York City, Cape Cod, and Chesapeake Bay through 1931.

Originally CL-25, effective 1 July 1931, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was redesignated CA-25 in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

Early in 1932, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;—with and —steamed to the West Coast for fleet maneuvers. They arrived at San Pedro, California, on 7 March, and following the scheduled exercises, were reassigned to the Pacific Fleet. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; visited Pearl Harbor in January–February 1933; and, in September, she was attached to CruDiv 4. From October 1933-January 1934, she underwent overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard; then resumed duty with CruDiv 4. In May, she sailed for New York to participate in the Fleet Review and returned to San Pedro on 18 December.

Through 1935, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; ranged the West Coast from San Diego to Seattle. In the first months of 1936, she conducted extensive gunnery exercises at San Clemente Island, and on 27 April departed San Pedro to participate in combined surface-subsurface operations at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; returned to San Pedro on 15 June and resumed West Coast operations until sailing for Hawaii on 25 April 1937. She returned to the West Coast on 20 May.

Her next extended cruise began on 13 January 1939, when she departed for the Caribbean, via the Panama Canal. During the next three months, she visited Panama, Colombia, the Virgin Islands, Trinidad, Cuba, and Haiti; returning to San Pedro on 7 April. From 12 October 1939 – 25 June 1940, she cruised between Pearl Harbor, Wake, and Guam, utilizing the services of while at Pearl Harbor. In August 1941, she visited Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.

===World War II===

===After Pearl Harbor===
On 7 December 1941, when the United States was brought into World War II by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;—under the command of Capt. Ellis M. Zacharias—was with the task group west of Pearl Harbor, returning from Wake Island, when they received word of the attack. The group immediately launched scouting planes in hopes of catching possible stragglers from the Japanese force, but the search proved fruitless. The ships entered Pearl Harbor toward sundown on the 8th.

After a tedious night refueling, they sortied before dawn to hunt submarines north of the islands. Submarines were encountered on the 10th-11th. The first—&quot;I-70&quot;—was sunk by dive bombers from &quot;Enterprise&quot;; the second—sighted ahead of the group on the surface—was engaged with gunfire by &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; as the ships maneuvered to avoid torpedoes. Screening destroyers made numerous depth charge runs, but no kill was confirmed. Operations against a third contact brought similar results. The group returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 December to refuel.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; operated with Task Force 8 (TF 8) until 23 December, covering Oahu and supporting the task force strike that was planned to relieve beleaguered Wake Island. After Wake fell, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;″s group moved to cover the reinforcement of Midway and then Samoa.

In February, &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s task force carried out air strikes in the eastern Marshalls at Wotje, Maloelap, and Kwajalein to reduce enemy seaplane bases. While conducting shore bombardment during those strikes, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; came under air attack and assisted in downing two Japanese bombers. In March, she supported air strikes at Marcus Island.

In April, she escorted TF 16, which launched the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo and other Japanese cities, and returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 April. Orders awaited the ships to sail as soon as possible to join the and forces in the Coral Sea. Although the task force moved fast, it had only reached a point some east of Tulagi by 8 May, the day of the Battle of the Coral Sea. What followed was essentially a retirement, and &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; operated as cover with her group; on the 11th off the New Hebrides, and from the 12th-16th eastward from Efate and Santa Cruz. On 16 May, she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor and arrived there 10 days later.
The carrier groups began intensive preparations to meet the expected Japanese thrust at Midway Atoll. During the battle, early in June, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; provided rear guard protection for the islands.

From August–October 1942, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was in the south Pacific to support the campaign to seize and hold Guadalcanal. She escorted during the landings of 7–8 August and subsequent operations.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; protected as she shuttled planes for and &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and provided Combat Air Patrol (CAP) and scouting patrols during the landings. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was with &quot;Wasp&quot; on 15 September when the carrier was torpedoed by Japanese submarines and sunk. She assisted in rescue operations for survivors, and took on board others who had been picked up by .

===Battle of Cape Esperance===
The campaign in the Solomons had developed into a grim struggle requiring the US Navy to commit heavy and light cruisers to savage night battles. On the night of 11–12 October in the Battle of Cape Esperance. TF 64 was formed around &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, , , and to attack the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;, a steady flow of Japanese vessels maintaining reinforcement and resupply to Guadalcanal. The force was not considered large enough to get involved with a major Japanese covering force; they were interested primarily in inflicting maximum damage to the transports. They arrived off Espiritu Santo on 7 October, and for two days steamed near Guadalcanal and waited. Land-based search-plane reports came in that an enemy force was steaming down The Slot; that night, TF 64 moved to the vicinity of Savo Island to intercept it.

Search planes were ordered launched from the cruisers, but in the process of launching, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;′s plane caught fire as flares ignited in the cockpit. The plane crashed close to the ship and the pilot managed to get free. He was later found safe on a nearby island. The brilliant fire was seen in the darkness by the Japanese flag officers, who assumed that it was a signal flare from the landing force which they were sent to protect. The Japanese flagship answered with blinker light. Despite receiving no reply, they continued to signal. The American force formed a battle line at right angles to the Japanese T-formation, and thus were able to enfilade the enemy ships. The American cruisers opened fire and continued scoring hits for a full seven minutes before the confused Japanese realized what was taking place. They had believed that their own forces were taking them under fire. When the Japanese warships replied, their fire was too little and too late. The action was over in half an hour. One Japanese cruiser, the , sank; the flagship cruiser was severely damaged and required several months of repairs; a third cruiser, , was lightly damaged; and the destroyer was sunk. Only a single destroyer of the five-ship force escaped damage. Of the American ships, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; sustained three major hits during the action; &quot;Boise&quot; was severely damaged but managed to rejoin the group under her own power; and was left gutted off Savo Island. The ships formed up and steamed to Espiritu Santo.

===Battle of the Komandorski Islands===
&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; spent the next four months at Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs and replenishing. Late in March 1943, she departed for the Aleutian Islands and operated from Adak Island to prevent the Japanese from supporting their garrisons on Attu and Kiska. Operating in TF 8, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was accompanied by and four destroyers when they made contact on 26 March with some Japanese transports, escorted by the heavy cruisers and , the light cruisers &quot;Tama&quot; and &quot;Abukuma&quot;, and four destroyers, led by Vice Admiral Boshiro Hosogaya leading to the Battle of the Komandorski Islands.
Believing that easy pickings were in store, the American warships formed up and closed the range. Two transports fled for safety as the Japanese warships turned to engage. The American group was outgunned and outnumbered, but pressed on and made a course change in hopes of getting a shot at the transports before the escorts could intervene. There was also a possibility that the Japanese would split their force and that &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot; could tackle a portion of them on more equal terms.

The opposing cruisers simultaneously opened fire at a range of . The ensuing battle was a retiring action on the part of the Americans, for the Japanese foiled their attempt to get to the auxiliaries. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; received most of the attention and soon received two hits, one of them amidships, mortally wounding two men, but she responded with very accurate fire. Her rudder stops were carried away, limiting her to 10° course changes. The starboard seaplane caught fire and was jettisoned. Another hit soon flooded forward compartments. Under cover of a thick smoke screen and aggressive torpedo attacks by the destroyers, the American cruisers were able to make an evasive turn, which for a while allowed the range to open. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; soon began taking hits again and her boiler fires died one by one. Salt water had entered the fuel oil feed lines. There was now cause for grave concern; she lay dead in the water, and the Japanese ships were closing fast. Luckily, she was hidden in the smoke, and the enemy was not aware of her plight.

The destroyers charged the Japanese cruisers and began to draw the fire away from the damaged &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;. &quot;Bailey&quot; suffered two hits while launching a spread of five torpedoes at long range. In the meantime, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;′s engineers purged the fuel lines and fired the boilers. With fresh oil supplying the fires, she built up steam and gained headway. Suddenly, the Japanese began to withdraw. This was due to the combination of the Japanese having intercepted demands for air support from the American forces, and the mistaken belief that the high explosive shells being fired in desperation by the American cruisers were air-dropped bombs. The Japanese forces were also fast exhausting their ammunition and fuel. They did not suspect that the Americans were in far worse shape in terms of both ammunition and fuel.

Despite being outnumbered two to one, the Americans succeeded in their purpose. The Japanese attempt to reinforce their bases in the Aleutians had failed and they turned tail and headed home. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; later covered the American liberation of Attu and Kiska which ended the Aleutian Campaign. She departed Adak on 23 September and sailed, via San Francisco, to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 14 October.

===After the Aleutian Campaign===
The Allied offensive strategy in the Pacific now focused on the Marshall Islands. A two-column thrust through Micronesia and the Bismarck Archipelago would force the enemy to disperse his forces, deny him the opportunity for a flanking movement, and provide the Allies with the choice of where and when to strike next. To obtain adequate intelligence for planning the Marshalls operation, the Gilbert Islands would have to be secured for use as a staging area and launch point for photographic missions. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was assigned to Task Group 50.3 (TG 50.3) of the Southern Carrier Group for the Gilbert Islands Campaign, Operation Galvanic.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; conducted rigorous gunnery training until 8 November, when she sailed to join , , and which had carried out preliminary strikes on Wake, as a diversion on 5–6 October, and at Rabaul on 11 November. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; joined on the 13th off Funafuti, Ellice Islands, following the carriers&#x27; fueling rendezvous at Espiritu Santo. She then saw action on the 19th as she bombarded Betio at Tarawa Atoll, in the Gilberts. That day and the next, she fought off repeated torpedo plane attacks aimed for the flattops. Tarawa was secured by the 28th. This was the first Pacific amphibious operation to be vigorously opposed at the beach, and many lessons were learned here to be applied in the island campaigns to follow.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was attached to the Neutralization Group—TG 50.15—for the long-awaited Marshalls Campaign. From 29 January-17 February 1944, she conducted shore bombardment at Wotje and Taroa islands which were bypassed and cut off from support as the major forces concentrated on Majuro, Eniwetok, and Kwajalein. This leapfrog technique worked well and eliminated the needless casualties that would result in mopping up every Japanese-held island. On 30 March–1 April, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; participated in raids on Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai in the western Caroline Islands archipelago. The cruiser anchored at Majuro on 6 April and remained until 25 April, when she sailed—unescorted—for Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 30 April and sailed the next day for Mare Island Naval Shipyard. She arrived on 7 May and operated in the San Francisco Bay area until 1 July. She then proceeded to Adak, Alaska arriving on the 8th. In the Aleutians, her operations, including a scheduled bombardment at Paramushiro were curtailed by severe weather, and she returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 August.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; sortied with and on 29 August to attack Wake Island. They shelled that island on 3 September, and then proceeded to Eniwetok to remain until the 24th. The cruisers then moved to Saipan for patrol duty after which, on 6 October, they proceeded to Marcus Island to create a diversion in connection with raids on Formosa. They shelled Marcus on 9 September and returned to Saipan.

In October, during the second Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; returned to screen and support duty with the carrier strike groups against Japanese bases and surface craft. Based at Ulithi, she supported the carriers between 15 and 26 October. From 8 November 1944 – 25 January 1945, she operated with CruDiv 5, TF 54, in bombardment against the Volcano Islands to neutralize airfields through which the Japanese staged bombing raids on the B-29 Superfortresses based at Saipan. These raids were coordinated with B-24 Liberator strikes. In February, she operated in the Gunfire and Covering Force—Task Force 54—during the final phases of securing Iwo Jima and the initial operations in the campaign for the invasion of Okinawa.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; provided call-fire at Iwo Jima until 13 March, and then concentrated her activities at Okinawa until 28 May, when she put into Leyte for repairs and upkeep. She returned to Okinawa to cover minesweeping operations and general patrol in the East China Sea as part of Task Force 95 on 6 July. A month later, on 8 August, she sailed for the Aleutians via Saipan. While en route to Adak, she received word on 31 August to proceed to northern Honshū, Japan, to cover the occupation of Ominato Naval Base.

===Post-war===
Like many warships at the close of the war, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was almost immediately slated for deactivation. She was originally ordered to report to Commander, 3rd Fleet, upon arrival on the West Coast, in October, for deactivation. On 29 October, however, she was diverted to Operation Magic Carpet duty to return veterans of the Pacific theater to the U.S.

On 14 November, she was added to the list of warships to be used as test vessels for Operation Crossroads, the Atomic Bomb Experiments and Evaluation Tests at Bikini Atoll. She was partially stripped and her crew reduced prior to sailing to Pearl Harbor in March 1946.

&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was used in evaluating the effects on surface vessels during an initial test with an aerial atomic bomb burst on 1 July and during the second test of a subsurface burst on 25 July. Surviving two atomic bomb blasts, she was decommissioned on 29 August and laid up to await ultimate disposal. She was sunk as a target hull on 25 May 1948, off the coast of Southern California and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 18 June 1948. Records preserved by the National Archives and Records Administration place the location of the wreckage at approximately 31°57&#x27;12.0&quot;N 119°54&#x27;24.0&quot;W, at 1800 fathoms deep.

==Awards==
&quot;Salt Lake City&quot; received 11 battle stars for her World War II service, and a Navy Unit Commendation for her actions during the Aleutian Campaign.

==In fiction==
In the 1965 film &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, a cruiser called &quot;Old Swayback&quot; was the cruiser commanded by Captain Rockwell Torrey (John Wayne) at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

== In popular culture ==

=== Video games ===
The &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; was present on the test server for &quot;World of Warships&quot; during the test for the US cruiser line overhaul in 2018. It served as a testing analogue for USS &quot;Pensacola&quot;″s then-pending relocation, as the latter vessel&#x27;s gameplay stats had been reduced to reflect her new placement earlier in the game&#x27;s progression. It was removed after the updated tech tree was published to the live server.

=== University of Utah ===
In August 2021, the University of Utah football team announced they would use grey uniforms during their 20 November 2021 game against Oregon to pay tribute to the &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; including &quot;dazzle-camo accents&quot; on the shoulders and sides of the pants and a single battle star on the right shoulder — 11 altogether when the team is on the field — that represents the 11 battle stars the ship earned in its 19-year history. The helmets were hand painted to resemble the ship in battle. The Utes won the nationally televised game 38-7.

<text>Hampton Roads is a body of water in the United States that serves as a wide channel for the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth rivers between Old Point Comfort and Sewell&#x27;s Point near where the Chesapeake Bay flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It also gave its name to the surrounding metropolitan region located in the southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina portions of the Tidewater Region.

Comprising the Virginia Beach–Chesapeake–Norfolk, VA–NC, metropolitan area and an extended combined statistical area that includes the Elizabeth City, North Carolina, micropolitan statistical area and Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, micropolitan statistical area, Hampton Roads is known for its large military presence, ice-free harbor, shipyards, coal piers, and miles of waterfront property and beaches, all of which contribute to the diversity and stability of the region&#x27;s economy.

The body of water known as Hampton Roads is one of the world&#x27;s largest natural harbors (more accurately a roadstead or &quot;roads&quot;). It incorporates the mouths of the Elizabeth, Nansemond, and James rivers, together with several smaller rivers, and empties into the Chesapeake Bay near its mouth leading to the Atlantic Ocean.

The land area includes a collection of cities, counties, and towns on the Virginia Peninsula and in South Hampton Roads. Some of the outlying areas further from the harbor may or may not be included as part of &quot;Hampton Roads&quot;, depending upon the organization or usage. For example, as defined for federal economic purposes, the Hampton Roads metropolitan statistical area (MSA) includes three counties in northeastern North Carolina and two counties in Virginia&#x27;s Middle Peninsula. The Virginia Beach–Chesapeake–Norfolk, VA–NC, MSA has an estimated 2023 population of 1,787,169, making it the 37th-largest metropolitan area in the United States. The Combined Statistical Area includes two additional counties in North Carolina, pushing the regional population to 1,866,723 residents, the 35th-largest CSA in the country.

The area is home to hundreds of historical sites and attractions. The harbor was the key to Hampton Roads&#x27; growth, both on land and in water-related activities and events. While the harbor and its tributaries were (and still are) important transportation conduits, at the same time they presented obstacles to land-based commerce and travel.

Creating and maintaining adequate infrastructure has long been a major challenge. The Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel (HRBT) and the Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel (MMMBT) are major harbor crossings of the Hampton Roads Beltway interstate, which links the large population centers of Hampton Roads. In 2009, the Hampton Roads Transportation Authority (HRTA) was abolished by the Virginia General Assembly less than two years after its creation. In 2014, the Hampton Roads Transportation Accountability Commission was established to oversee the Hampton Roads Transportation Fund.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Hampton Roads&quot; is a centuries-old designation that originated when the region was a struggling English outpost nearly four hundred years ago.

The word &quot;Hampton&quot; honors one of the founders of the Virginia Company of London and a great supporter of the colonization of Virginia, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. The early administrative center of the new colony was known as Elizabeth Cittie, named for Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of King James I, and formally designated by the Virginia Company in 1619. The town at the center of Elizabeth Cittie became known as &quot;Hampton&quot;, and a nearby waterway was designated Hampton Creek (also known as Hampton River).

Other references to the Earl include the area to the north across the bay (in what is now the Eastern Shore) which became known as Northampton, and an area south of the James River which became Southampton. As with Hampton, both of these names remain in use today.

The term &quot;Roads&quot; (short for roadstead) indicates the safety of a port; as applied to a body of water, it is &quot;a partly sheltered area of water near a shore in which vessels may ride at anchor&quot;. Examples of other roadsteads are Castle Roads, in another of the Virginia Company&#x27;s settlements, Bermuda, and Lahaina Roads, in Hawaii.

In 1755, the Virginia General Assembly recorded the name &quot;Hampton Roads&quot; as the channel linking the James, Elizabeth, and Nansemond rivers with the Chesapeake Bay.

Hampton Roads is among the world&#x27;s largest natural harbors. It is the northernmost major East Coast port of the United States which is ice-free year round. (This status is claimed with the notable exception of the extraordinarily cold winter of 1917, which was the entire U.S.&#x27;s coldest year on record.)

Over time, the entire region has come to be known as &quot;Hampton Roads&quot;, a label more specific than its other moniker, &quot;Tidewater Virginia&quot;, which includes the whole coastal region of the state. The U.S. Postal Service changed the area&#x27;s postmark from &quot;Tidewater Virginia&quot; to &quot;Hampton Roads, Virginia&quot; beginning in 1983.

==Definitions==
===Counties and independent cities===
The U.S. Census Bureau defines the &quot;Virginia Beach–Chesapeake–Norfolk, VA–NC, MSA&quot; as 18 county-level jurisdictions—six counties and nine independent cities in Virginia, and three counties in North Carolina. While the borders of what locals call &quot;Hampton Roads&quot; may not perfectly align with the definition of the MSA, Hampton Roads is most often the name used for the metropolitan area.

&quot;Virginia Beach–Chesapeake–Norfolk, VA–NC, MSA&quot; is a U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). In 2023, the population was estimated to be 1,787,169.

&quot;Since a state constitutional change in 1871, all cities in Virginia are independent cities and they are not legally located in a county. The OMB considers these independent cities to be county-equivalents for the purpose of defining MSAs in Virginia. Each MSA is listed by its counties, then cities, in alphabetical order and not by size.&quot;

====In Virginia====
The MSA consists of these locations in Virginia:

Counties
* Gloucester County
* Isle of Wight County
* James City County
* Mathews County
* Surry County
* York County

Cities
* City of Chesapeake
* City of Hampton
* City of Newport News
* City of Norfolk
* City of Poquoson
* City of Portsmouth
* City of Suffolk
* City of Virginia Beach
* City of Williamsburg

====In North Carolina====
The MSA also includes the following locations in North Carolina:
* Camden County
* Currituck County
* Gates County

===Evolution of Hampton Roads===
The Hampton Roads metropolitan area was first defined in 1950 as the &quot;Norfolk–Portsmouth Metropolitan Statistical Area&quot;. It comprised the independent cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth and South Norfolk and the counties of Norfolk and Princess Anne. In 1952, Virginia Beach separated from Princess Anne County.

In 1963, Virginia Beach and Princess Anne County merged, retaining the name Virginia Beach. The city was added to the MSA that year, while South Norfolk lost its metropolitan status. Also in 1963, Norfolk County and the City of South Norfolk merged to create the city of Chesapeake.

In 1970, Chesapeake was added to the MSA, while Virginia Beach became a primary city.

In 1973, Currituck County, North Carolina was added to the MSA.

In 1983, the &quot;Newport News–Hampton Metropolitan Statistical Area&quot;, comprising the cities of Newport News, Hampton, Poquoson and Williamsburg, and the counties of Gloucester, James City and York, was combined with the Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Portsmouth MSA and renamed the &quot;Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Newport News MSA&quot;.

In 1993, Isle of Wight, Mathews and Surry counties were added. Although Virginia Beach had passed Norfolk as the state&#x27;s largest city by 1990, it was not made the first primary city of the MSA until 2010.

As a result of the 2010 Census, Gates County, North Carolina was added to the MSA, while Surry County, Virginia was removed.

===Combined Statistical Area===
The Virginia Beach–Chesapeake, VA–NC, Combined Statistical Area additionally includes the Elizabeth City, NC, Micropolitan Statistical Area, comprising:
* Pasquotank County

and the Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, Micropolitan Statistical Area, comprising:
* Dare County

The estimated population in 2023 of the Combined Statistical Area was 1,866,723. It is the 35th largest in the country. Among the metropolitan areas in Virginia, only the Northern Virginia portion of the Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV, MSA is larger.

==Geography==
The metropolitan area and water area is in the Tidewater region, a low-lying plains region composed of southeastern portions of Virginia and northeastern portions of North Carolina.
The water area known as Hampton Roads is a wide channel through which the waters of the James River, Nansemond River, and Elizabeth River pass (between Old Point Comfort to the north and Sewell&#x27;s Point to the south) into the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.

Norfolk and Hampton Roads are among the worst-hit parts of the United States by the effects of global warming. As of 2016, the region is a few decades ahead in feeling the effects of sea-level rise compared to many American coastal areas.

The geology and topography of the Hampton Roads region is influenced by the Chesapeake Bay impact crater, one of three factors contributing to the sinking of Hampton Roads at a rate between per century.

The region has extensive natural areas, including of Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay beaches, the Great Dismal Swamp, picturesque rivers, state parks, wildlife refuges, and botanical gardens. Inland from the bay, the region includes Lake Drummond, one of only two natural lakes in Virginia, and miles of waterfront property along the various rivers and waterways. The region&#x27;s native flora is consistent with that of the Southeast Coastal Plain and the lower Southeast Maritime Forest.

The land area that constitutes Hampton Roads varies depending upon perspective and purpose. Most of Hampton Roads&#x27; land is geographically divided into 2 smaller regions: the eastern portion of the Virginia Peninsula (the Peninsula) and South Hampton Roads (locally known as &quot;the Southside&quot;), which are separated by the harbor. When speaking of communities of Hampton Roads, virtually all sources include the seven major cities, two smaller ones, and three counties within those two subregions.

In addition, the Middle Peninsula counties of Gloucester and Mathews, while not part of the geographical Hampton Roads area, are included in the metropolitan region&#x27;s population, as is a small portion of northeastern North Carolina (Currituck County). Due to a peculiarity in the drawing of the Virginia-North Carolina border, Knott&#x27;s Island in that county is connected to Virginia by land, but is only accessible to other parts of North Carolina by water via a ferry system.

Each of the following current cities, counties and towns is included by at least one of the three organizations that define Hampton Roads:
The Hampton Roads area consists of nine independent cities (which are not part of any county). Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk, and Virginia Beach cover the Southside of Hampton Roads while Hampton, Newport News, Poquoson, and Williamsburg are on the Peninsula. Franklin borders Suffolk but the Census Bureau does not consider it part of the metro area.

The metro area has one county in North Carolina, Currituck. The remaining counties, in Virginia, include Isle of Wight and Surry on the Southside, James City and York on the Virginia Peninsula, and Gloucester and Mathews on the Middle Peninsula. While Southampton is adjacent to Surry, Isle of Wight, and the City of Suffolk, the Census Bureau does not consider it part of the metro area.

Five incorporated towns are in the metro area, including Claremont in Surry County, Dendron in Surry County, Smithfield in Isle of Wight County, Surry, Surry County&#x27;s seat, and Windsor in Isle of Wight County. (Two other incorporated towns, Boykins and Courtland, are in Southampton County, and therefore, like the county within which they are located, are not part of the federally defined metropolitan area).

Other unincorporated towns and communities in the metropolitan area that are not within its cities include Gloucester Courthouse and Gloucester Point in Gloucester County, Isle of Wight Courthouse, Rushmere, Rescue, Carrollton, Benns Church, and Walters in Isle of Wight County, Yorktown, Grafton, Seaford, and Tabb in York County, Jamestown, Ford&#x27;s Colony, Grove, Lightfoot, Toano, and Norge in James City County, Moyock, Knotts Island, and Currituck in Currituck County, North Carolina.

The Hampton Roads MSA, with a population of about 1.8 million, is the seventh-largest metropolitan area in the Southeastern United States, after the Washington metropolitan area; Miami–Fort Lauderdale–Pompano Beach, FL, MSA; Atlanta–Sandy Springs–Marietta, GA, MSA, Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, FL, MSA; Orlando–Kissimmee, FL, MSA; and Charlotte–Gastonia-Rock Hill, NC–SC, MSA.

==History==

===17th–19th centuries===
The first colonists arrived in 1607 when English Captain Christopher Newport landed at Cape Henry, today&#x27;s City of Virginia Beach, an event now called the &quot;First Landing.&quot; However, his party moved on, in search of a more defensible area upriver, mindful of competitors such as the Spanish, who had built a failed settlement on the Virginia Peninsula known as the Ajacán Mission.

After exploring the James River, they established the first successful English colony in the New World on Jamestown Island on May 14, 1607. But the low, marshy site proved unhealthy and most of the colonists died, before a new Governor, Lord De La Warr (Delaware) arrived with John Rolfe, who would establish the Virginia tobacco industry.

The harbor and rivers of Hampton Roads were immediately recognized as prime locations for commerce, shipbuilding and military installations, with the fortifications at Old Point Comfort established as early as 1610, and Gosport Navy Yard (later Norfolk Naval Shipyard) in 1767. The decisive battle of the Revolution was won at Yorktown in 1781, and the first naval action of the War of 1812 took place in Hampton Roads, when the Royal Navy schooner &quot;Whiting&quot; was seized by the American privateer &quot;Dash&quot;. Later the entrance from Chesapeake Bay was equipped with new fortifications (Fort Monroe and Fort Wool), much of the building work being supervised by a young military engineer Robert E. Lee.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the historic Battle of Hampton Roads between the first American ironclad warships, the and the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, took place off Sewell&#x27;s Point in 1862. The battle was inconclusive, but Union forces later took control of Hampton Roads, Norfolk, and the lower James River, though they were thwarted from venturing further upstream by a strong Confederate battery at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff. Also in 1862, Fort Monroe was the launching place for Union General George McClellan&#x27;s massive advance up the Virginia Peninsula, which almost reached the Confederate capital Richmond, before the Seven Days Battles forced him back. In 1865, as the Confederacy was near collapse, President Abraham Lincoln met with three senior Confederates at Hampton Roads in an unsuccessful bid for a negotiated peace.

Some former slaves had been camped near Fort Monroe, where they were declared to be Contraband of war, instead of being returned to their former owners. Booker T. Washington was among the freedmen who attended the local school, which evolved into the present-day Hampton University.

===20th century===
The Jamestown Exposition for the 300th anniversary of the 1607 founding of Jamestown was held at Sewell&#x27;s Point in a rural section of Norfolk County in 1907.

President Theodore Roosevelt arrived by water in the harbor of Hampton Roads, as did other notable persons such as Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers, who both arrived aboard the latter&#x27;s steam yacht &quot;Kanawha&quot;. A major naval display was featured, and the U.S. Great White Fleet made an appearance. The leaders of the U.S. Navy apparently did not fail to note the ideal harbor conditions, as was later proved.

Beginning in 1917, as the United States became involved in World War I under President Woodrow Wilson, formerly rural Sewell&#x27;s Point became the site of what grew to become the largest Naval Base in the world which was established by the United States Navy and is now known as the Naval Station Norfolk.

Twice in the 20th century, inhabitants mostly African American were displaced when land along the northern side of the Peninsula primarily in York County west of Yorktown was taken in large tracts for military use during World War I and World War II, creating the present-day U.S. Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, which includes Cheatham Annex, and a former Seabee base which became Camp Peary.

Communities including &quot;the Reservation&quot;, Halstead&#x27;s Point, Penniman, Bigler&#x27;s Mill, and Magruder were all lost and absorbed into the large military bases.

Although some left the area entirely, many of the displaced families chose to relocate nearby to Grove, an unincorporated town in southeastern James City County where many generations of some of those families now reside. From a population estimated at only 37 in 1895, Grove had grown to an estimated 1,100 families by the end of the 20th century. (To its north, Grove actually borders the Naval Weapons Station property and on its extreme east, a portion of the U.S. Army&#x27;s land at Fort Eustis extends across Skiffe&#x27;s Creek, although there is no direct access to either base).

===Colonial Williamsburg===

It was the dream of an Episcopal priest to save his 18th-century church building by turning Williamsburg into the world&#x27;s largest living museum. Williamsburg replaced Jamestown at the very end of the 17th century after a disastrous fire. It was the capital of the colony and the new State of Virginia from 1699 to 1780. The capital was moved to Richmond in 1780. Williamsburg became a &quot;sleepy&quot; small town. During the Civil War the Battle of Williamsburg was fought nearby during the Peninsula Campaign in the spring months of 1862. The decaying town was not located along any major waterway and did not have railroad access until 1881. Perhaps due to the secure inland location originally known as Middle Plantation Williamsburg missed growth and economic expansion in the 19th century. The main economic engines were The College of William &amp; Mary and Eastern State Hospital. The College of William and Mary was chartered by the Crown and is the only pre-Independence college to have kept it. In addition to the city&#x27;s historic past, quite a few buildings of antiquity from the 18th century were still extant, although time was taking a toll by the early 20th century. The Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin of Bruton Parish Church motive was to only to save historic church building which was secured by 1907. He subsequently served in Rochester, New York for many years. Upon returning to Williamsburg in 1923 he realized that many of the other colonial-era buildings were deteriorating and their existence was at risk.

Goodwin dreamt of a much larger restoration of the colonial town. A cleric of modest means, he first sought support and financing from a number of sources before successfully drawing the interests before receiving major financial support from Standard Oil heir and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his wife Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. The result is the creation of Colonial Williamsburg with extensive restoration of buildings such as the Wren Building of the College of William &amp; Mary and the Governor&#x27;s Palace, and the transformation of downtown Williamsburg area into Historic District of restored buildings. Many 19th century buildings were removed.

By the 1930s, Colonial Williamsburg had become the centerpiece of the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia. These were, of course, Jamestown, where the colony started, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, where independence from Great Britain was won. The three points were joined by the U.S. National Park Service&#x27;s Colonial Parkway, a remarkable accomplishment in course of 27 years. The Historic Triangle area of the Hampton Roads region became one of the largest tourist attractions in Virginia.
In Dr. Goodwin&#x27;s words: &quot;Williamsburg is Jamestown continued, and Yorktown is Williamsburg vindicated.&quot;

==Government==
The area consists of ten independent cities and six counties. Each independent city has the powers and responsibilities of a county, including maintaining roads, courts, schools, and public safety. Some cities share these responsibilities with an adjoining county. Incorporated towns located within counties in Virginia operate with some level of autonomy, with some larger Towns exercising more autonomy than others.

The localities come together to consult on regional issues. Virginia defines regional planning districts by law. District members are usually independent cities and counties. Localities around the state may belong to more than one Planning District, as their constituents may have interests which cross over individual planning district boundaries.

The Hampton Roads Planning District Commission (HRPDC) currently includes 16 cities and counties and one incorporated town in Virginia, representing over 1.7 million people.

The 17 jurisdictions include:
* the Cities of Chesapeake, Franklin, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, and Williamsburg,
* the Counties of Gloucester, Isle of Wight, James City, Southampton, Surry, and York
* the Town of Smithfield

There are incorporated towns in three of the counties (Isle of Wight, Southampton and Surry) within the district.

The differences between the service area of the HRPDC and the federally defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA) are:
* Southampton County and the City of Franklin are not in the MSA.
* Mathews County is in the MSA but not the HRPDC.
* The MSA includes Currituck County and Gates County, North Carolina, but the HRPDC does not.

The Federal government has two major research laboratories in the area. NASA-Langley, on the northeast edge of Hampton near Poquoson, is the home of a variety of aeronautics research, including several one-of-a-kind wind tunnels. The Department of Energy&#x27;s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (known as &#x27;Jefferson Lab&#x27;) conducts cutting edge physics research in Newport News; the lab hosts the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and a kilowatt-class free-electron laser.

===U.S. military===
The military has a large presence in the region. Area military facilities (alphabetically) include:
==Economy==

Hampton Roads is home to two &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies. Representing the retail and shipbuilding industry, these two companies are located in Chesapeake and Newport News.
;2021 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 Corporations
* 111 Dollar Tree
* 327 Huntington Ingalls Industries

Hampton Roads has become known as the &quot;world&#x27;s greatest natural harbor.&quot; The port is located only from open ocean on one of the world&#x27;s deepest, natural ice-free harbors. Since 1989, Hampton Roads has been the mid-Atlantic leader in U.S. waterborne foreign commerce and is ranked second nationally behind the Port of South Louisiana based on export tonnage. When import and export tonnage are combined, the Port of Hampton Roads ranks as the third largest port in the country (following the ports of New Orleans/South Louisiana and Houston). In 1996, Hampton Roads was ranked ninth among major U.S. ports in vessel port calls with approximately 2,700. In addition, this port is the U.S. leader in coal exports. The coal loading facilities in the Port of Hampton Roads are able to load in excess of 65 million tons annually, giving the port the largest, most efficient and modern coal loading facilities in the world.

It is little surprise therefore that the Hampton Roads region&#x27;s economic base is largely port-related, including shipbuilding, ship repair, naval installations, cargo transfer and storage, and manufacturing related to the processing of imports and exports. Associated with the ports&#x27; military role are almost 50,000 federal civilian employees.

The harbor of Hampton Roads is an important highway of commerce, especially for the cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, and Newport News.

Huntington Ingalls Industries (formerly Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company), was created in 2008 as a spinoff of Northrop Grumman Newport News and is the world&#x27;s largest shipyard. It is located a short distance up the James River. In Portsmouth, a few miles up the Elizabeth River, the historic Norfolk Naval Shipyard is located. BAE Systems, formerly known as NORSHIPCO, operates from sites in the City of Norfolk. There are also several smaller shipyards, numerous docks and terminals.
Massive coal piers and loading facilities were established in the late 19th and early 20th century by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O), Norfolk and Western Railway (N&amp;W), and Virginian Railway (VGN). The latter two were predecessors of the Norfolk Southern Railway, a Class I railroad which has its headquarters in Norfolk, and continues to export coal from a large facility at Lambert&#x27;s Point on the Elizabeth River. CSX Transportation now serves the former C&amp;O facility at Newport News. (The VGN&#x27;s former coal facility at Sewell&#x27;s Point has been gone since the 1960s, and the property is now part of the expansive Norfolk Navy Base).

===Federal impact===
Almost 80% of the region&#x27;s economy is derived from federal sources. This includes the large military presence, but also NASA and facilities of the Departments of Energy, Transportation, Commerce and Veterans Affairs. The region also receives a substantial impact in government student loans and grants, university research grants, and federal aid to cities.

The Hampton Roads area has the largest concentration of military bases and facilities of any metropolitan area in the world. Nearly one-fourth of the nation&#x27;s active-duty military personnel are stationed in Hampton Roads, and 45% of the region&#x27;s $81B gross regional output is Defense-related. All five military services&#x27; operating forces are there, as well as several major command headquarters: Hampton Roads is a chief rendezvous of the United States Navy, and the area is home to the Allied Command Transformation, which is the only major military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on U.S. soil. Langley Air Force Base is home to Air Combat Command (ACC). The Norfolk Navy Base is located at Sewell&#x27;s Point near the mouth, on the site used for the tercentennial Jamestown Exposition in 1907. For a width of the Federal government during 1902 through 1905 increased its minimum depth at low water from , and the channel has now been dredged to a depth of in some places.
NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center, located on the Peninsula adjacent to Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, is home to scientific and aerospace technology research. The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (commonly known as Jefferson Lab) is located nearby in Newport News.

===Commercial growth===
The area&#x27;s experiences with commercial and retail centers began early in 1918. Afton Square, located in the Cradock naval community (now part of Portsmouth), was the first planned shopping center in the US and has served as template for future developments throughout the nation.

Hampton Roads experienced tremendous growth during and after World War II. In the 1950s, a trend in retail was the shopping center, a group of stores along a common sidewalk adjacent to off-street parking, usually in a suburban location.

In 1959, one of the largest shopping centers on the east coast of the US was opened at the northeast corner of Military Highway and Virginia Beach Boulevard on property which had formally been used as an airfield. The new JANAF Shopping Center, located in Norfolk, featured acres of free parking and dozens of stores. Backed by retired military personnel, the name JANAF was an acronym for Joint Army Navy Air Force.

During the 1950s and early 1960s, other shopping centers in Hampton Roads were developed, such as Wards Corner Shopping Center, Downtown Plaza Shopping Center and Southern Shopping Center in Norfolk; Mid-City Shopping Center in Portsmouth; Hilltop Shopping Center (now known as The Shops at Hilltop) in Virginia Beach; Riverdale Shopping Center in Hampton and the Warwick-Denbigh Shopping Center in Newport News.

In the late-1960s, a new type of shopping center came to Hampton Roads: the indoor shopping mall. In 1965, South Hampton Roads broke ground on its first shopping mall in Virginia Beach, known as Pembroke Mall. The mall opened in 1966, and became Hampton Road&#x27;s newest indoor shopping destination. The Virginia Peninsula had its first indoor shopping mall in 1973, with Coliseum Mall. Coliseum Mall drew so much traffic from Interstate 64, that a towering flyover was built at the Mercury Boulevard and Coliseum Drive intersection, to accommodate eastbound mall traffic, from the Mercury Boulevard interchange. Coliseum Mall was demolished to make way for the open air mixed-use development Peninsula Town Center. Also in the 1970s, Tower Mall was built in Portsmouth, but was torn down and turned into the Victory Crossing shopping development. In Norfolk, Military Circle Mall on Military Highway was built across Virginia Beach Boulevard from the large JANAF Shopping Center with its own high-rise hotel right in the center. In 1981, Greenbrier Mall gave Chesapeake a shopping mall of its own as well, and Virginia Beach got the massive Lynnhaven Mall the same year.

Chesapeake Square Mall was constructed in Chesapeake, Virginia, in 1989, near the border of Suffolk, Virginia, and has spawned a number of shopping centers in the surrounding areas. 
MacArthur Center opened in March 1999, which made downtown Norfolk a prime shoppers destination, with the region&#x27;s first Nordstrom department store anchor. MacArthur Center is similar to other downtown malls of the same era, such as Baltimore&#x27;s Harborplace, Indianapolis&#x27; Circle Centre Mall, Atlanta&#x27;s Lenox Square Mall and most comparably to The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City near Washington, D.C., in Arlington, Virginia.

Currently, Virginia Beach&#x27;s Lynnhaven Mall is the region&#x27;s largest shopping center with nearly 180 stores, and is one of the region&#x27;s biggest tourist draws, with the Virginia Beach Oceanfront, Colonial Williamsburg, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and MacArthur Center.

For a long time, the indoor shopping malls were seen as largely competitive with small shopping centers and traditional downtown type areas. However, in the 1990s and since, the big-box stores on the Peninsula and Southside, such as Wal-mart, Home Depot, and Target have been creating a new competitive atmosphere for the shopping malls of Hampton Roads.
Several older malls have since their grand openings been renovated, and others have been closed and torn down. Newmarket North Mall is now NetCenter, a business center. Coliseum Mall, in Hampton, has been redeveloped as Peninsula Town Center in a new style, in step with the latest commercial real estate trend: the nationwide establishment of lifestyle centers. Additional malls which have closed include Mercury Mall in Hampton (converted to Mercury Plaza Shopping Center in the mid-1980s, then completely torn down in 2001), Tower Mall in Portsmouth (Built in the early 1970s, then torn down in 2001), Military Circle Mall in Norfolk (closed in 2023), and Pembroke Mall in Virginia Beach (closed in 2022).

===America&#x27;s first region===
In late 2006, the Hampton Roads Partnership, a non-profit organization representing 17 localities (ten cities, six counties, and one town), all local universities and major military commands as well as leading businesses in southeastern Virginia, commenced a campaign aimed at branding the land area of Hampton Roads as &quot;America&#x27;s First Region&quot;.

The new title is based on events in 1607 when English Captain Christopher Newport&#x27;s three ships – the &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, and &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Cape Henry along the Atlantic Coast in what is today Virginia Beach. After 18 days of exploring the area, the ships and their crews arrived at Jamestown Island where they established the first English speaking settlement to survive in the New World on May 14, 1607.

Because the region&#x27;s east–west boundaries (now the City of Virginia Beach and James City County) have not changed since 1607, the Partnership felt justified in labeling Hampton Roads &quot;America&#x27;s First Region&quot;. It unveiled the new brand before 800 people at the annual meeting of the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce on December 13, 2006. A video shown that afternoon included endorsements from mayors and county board of supervisors chairs representing Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg and James City County as well as the Governor of Virginia, Timothy Kaine.

The mission of Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance (HREDA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to business attraction—marketing the Hampton Roads region as the preferred location for business investment and expansion.

==Transportation==
Historically, from the earliest times, the harbor was the key to the Hampton Roads area&#x27;s growth, both on land and in water-related activities and events. The harbor and its tributary waterways were (and still are) both important transportation conduits and obstacles to other land-based commerce and travel. Yet, the community leaders learned to overcome them.

In modern times, the region has faced increasing transportation challenges as it has become largely urbanized, with additional traffic needs. In the 21st century, the conflicts between traffic on vital waterways and land-based travel continue to present the area&#x27;s leaders with extraordinary transportation challenges, both for additional capacity, and as the existing infrastructure, much of it originally built with toll revenues, has aged without an adequate source of funding to repair or build replacements. The now-closed Kings Highway Bridge in Suffolk and the Jordan Bridge closed by neighboring Chesapeake in 2008 were each built in the 1920s. These were considered locally prime examples of this situation.

In 2007, the new Hampton Roads Transportation Authority (HRTA) was formed under a controversial state law to levy various additional taxes to generate funding for major regional transportation projects, including a long-sought and costly additional crossing of the harbor of Hampton Roads (The Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel, Monitor-Merrimac Bridge Tunnel, and the James River Bridge are the existing crossings). As of March 2008, although its projects were considered to be needed, the agency&#x27;s future was in some question while its controversial sources of funding were being reconsidered in light of a Virginia Supreme Court decision.

Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, located in Newport News, and Norfolk International Airport, in Norfolk, both cater to passengers from Hampton Roads. The primary airport for the Virginia Peninsula is the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport. The Airport experienced a 4th year of record, double-digit growth through 2011, making it one of the fastest growing airports in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 however, the airport lost its biggest carrier and has seen massive declines in passenger service, culminating in layoffs of police officers and many other staff.
Norfolk International Airport , serves the region. The airport is located near Chesapeake Bay, along the city limits of Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Seven airlines provide nonstop services to twenty five destinations. ORF had 3,703,664 passengers take off or land at its facility and 68,778,934 pounds of cargo were processed through its facilities.

The Hampton Roads Executive Airport (KPVG), located on US460/US58, is the state&#x27;s 3rd busiest General Aviation airport and hosts the largest number of general aviation aircraft of any Virginia airport. The airport offers flight training, avionics services, as well as major and minor airframe and powerplant repairs. There is also a sit-down restaurant in the terminal.

The Chesapeake Regional Airport (KCPK) provides similar general aviation services and is located in the city of Chesapeake. Additionally, many local general aviation pilots fly from the nearby Suffolk (KSFQ), Wakefield (KAKQ) and Franklin (KFKN) airports.

Amtrak serves the region with Northeast Regional trains to its Norfolk, Williamsburg and Newport News stations. The lines run west to Richmond then north to Washington, D.C., and major cities north to Boston. Connecting buses are available between the Norfolk and Newport News stations and from both stations to Virginia Beach. A high-speed rail connection at Richmond to both the Northeast Corridor and the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor are also under study.

Intercity bus service is provided by Greyhound Lines (Carolina Trailways) with bus stations in Newport News, Hampton, and Norfolk. Transportation within Hampton Roads is served by a regional bus service, Hampton Roads Transit. Local routes serving Williamsburg, James City County, and upper York County is operated by Williamsburg Area Transit Authority.

A light rail service known as The Tide was constructed in Norfolk. It began service in August 2011. Operated by Hampton Roads Transit, it is the first light rail service in the state. It is projected to have a daily ridership of between 7,130 and 11,400 passengers a day. There has also been a light rail study in the Hampton – Newport News areas. In the 2016 election, a referendum was on the ballot in Virginia Beach to kill the planned, and mainly state-funded extension of the Tide to the commercial center of Virginia Beach and ultimately to the oceanfront. The ballot initiative won, cancelling the project. The transit authority and the state were left with new light rail cars and major infrastructure for the extension to be disposed of. There are no further plans for light rail mass transit initiatives within Virginia Beach.
The Hampton Roads area has an extensive network of Interstate Highways, including the Interstate 64, the major east–west route to and from the area, and its spurs and bypasses of I-264, I-464, I-564, and I-664.

The Hampton Roads Beltway extends on a long loop through the region, crossing the harbor on two toll-free bridge–tunnel facilities. These crossings are the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel between Phoebus in Hampton and Willoughby Spit in Norfolk and the Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel between Newport News and Suffolk. The Beltway connects with another Interstate highway and three arterial U.S. Highways at Bower&#x27;s Hill near the northeastern edge of the Great Dismal Swamp. Other major east–west routes are U.S. Route 58, U.S. Route 60, and U.S. Route 460. The major north–south routes are U.S. Route 13 and U.S. Route 17.

There are also two other tunnels in the area, the Midtown Tunnel, and the Downtown Tunnel joining Portsmouth and Norfolk, as well as the -long Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, a toll facility which links the region with Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore which carries US 13. The original Downtown Tunnel in conjunction with the Berkley Bridge were considered a single bridge and tunnel complex when completed in 1952, perhaps stimulating the innovative bridge-tunnel design using man-made islands when the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was planned, first opening in 1957. The George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge is a major toll bridge connecting U.S. Highway 17 on the Peninsula at Yorktown with Virginia&#x27;s Middle Peninsula region. Another major crossing of waterways is the James River Bridge, carrying US 17 US 258, and SR 32 from Newport News to Isle of Wight County.

The region is notable in that it has 2 types of public transport services via ferries. A passenger ferry is operated on the Elizabeth River between downtown areas of Norfolk and Portsmouth by HRT. The Jamestown Ferry (also known as the Jamestown-Scotland Ferry) is an automobile ferry system on the James River connecting Jamestown in James City County with Scotland in Surry County. It carries State Route 31. Operated by VDOT, it is the only 24-hour state-run ferry operation in Virginia and has over 90 employees. It operates four ferryboats, the &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, the &quot;Williamsburg&quot;, the &quot;Surry&quot;, and the &quot;Virginia&quot;. The facility is toll-free.

The area is most often associated with the larger American South. People who have grown up in the Hampton Roads area have a unique Tidewater accent which sounds different from a stereotypical Southern accent. Vowels have a longer pronunciation than in a regular southern accent.

===Flag===

In 1998, a flag representing the Hampton Roads region was adopted. The design of the flag was created by a contest. The winner, sixteen-year-old Andrew J. Wall of Frank W. Cox High School in Virginia Beach, raised the new regional flag for the first time on the mast of a ship moored in the harbor.

As conceived by student Andrew Wall and embellished by the selection committee, his flag is highly symbolic:
:The ring of sixteen white stars stands for the cities and counties that comprise the region of Hampton Roads. The blue upper panel refers to the sea and sky, recalling the first European settlers at Jamestown in 1607, the first battle between ironclad ships in 1862, the importance of shipbuilding and ship repair in the area, as well as maritime commerce, fishing, recreational boating, and the major military and government installations around the area&#x27;s shores. Agriculture, the environment, tourism, industry, and a healthy quality of life are suggested by the lower panel of green. The wavy white central band with three crests suggests past, present, and future. The wave also recalls the surf and sand dunes of the area as seen from the sea. Water is the central theme. It touches all the components and binds them together.

===Sites of interest===
====Parks and recreation====
The Norfolk Botanical Garden, opened in 1939, is a botanical garden and arboretum located near the Norfolk International Airport. It is open year-round.

====Historic Triangle====
The Historic Triangle is located on the Virginia Peninsula and includes the colonial communities of Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown. The sites are linked by a scenic roadway, the National Park Service&#x27;s Colonial Parkway.

The Jamestown settlement in the Colony of Virginia was the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. It was established by the Virginia Company of London as &quot;James Fort&quot; on May 4, 1607, and was considered permanent after brief abandonment in 1610. It followed several failed attempts, including the Lost Colony of Roanoke. Jamestown served as the capital of the colony of Virginia for 83 years, from 1616 until 1699.

Historic Jamestowne is the archaeological site on Jamestown Island and is a cooperative effort by Jamestown National Historic Site (part of Colonial National Historical Park) and Preservation Virginia. Jamestown Settlement, a living history interpretive site, is operated by the Jamestown Yorktown Foundation, a state agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

Williamsburg was founded in 1632 as Middle Plantation, a fortified settlement on high ground between the James and York rivers. The city served as the capital of the Colony of Virginia from 1699 to 1780 and was the center of political events in Virginia leading to the American Revolution. The College of William &amp; Mary, established in 1693, is the second-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and the only one of the nine colonial colleges located in the South; its alumni include three U.S. presidents as well as many other important figures in the nation&#x27;s early history.

The city&#x27;s tourism-based economy is driven by Colonial Williamsburg, the restored Historic Area of the city. Modern Williamsburg is also a college town, inhabited in large part by William &amp; Mary students and staff.

Yorktown is one of the eight original shires formed in colonial Virginia in 1682. The town is most famous as the site of the siege and subsequent surrender of General Charles Cornwallis to General George Washington and the French Fleet during the American Revolutionary War on October 19, 1781. Although the war would last for another year, this British defeat at Yorktown effectively ended the war. Yorktown also figured prominently in the American Civil War (1861–1865), serving as a major port to supply both northern and southern towns, depending upon who held Yorktown at the time. It is the eastern terminus of the Colonial Parkway connecting these locations. Yorktown is also the eastern terminus of the TransAmerica Trail, a bicycle touring route created by the Adventure Cycling Association.

===Radio===
Norfolk is served by a variety of radio stations on the and dials, with towers located around the Hampton Roads area. These cater to many different interests, including news, talk radio, and sports, as well as an eclectic mix of musical interests.

==Sports==
The Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA-NC Combined Statistical Area is one of the largest statistical areas in the United States without a professional sports franchise in one of the five major North American sports leagues (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS).

===Team sports===
Norfolk serves as home to two professional franchises, the Norfolk Tides of the International League and the Norfolk Admirals of the ECHL. The Tides play at Harbor Park, seating 12,067 and opened in 1993. The Admirals play at the Norfolk Scope arena, seating 8,725 or 13,800 festival seating, which opened in 1971. Hampton Roads was formerly home to the ABA Virginia Squires, alternating between Norfolk and Hampton, as well as Richmond and Roanoke. The Squires folded in 1976, after the league merged with the NBA.

Lionsbridge FC competes in USL League Two, the top pre-professional men&#x27;s soccer league in North America. The club began play in 2018 and was named USL League Two Franchise of the Year in 2019. They play home games on the campus of Christopher Newport University. The Peninsula Pilots play in the Coastal Plain League, a summer baseball league. The Pilots play in Hampton at War Memorial Stadium seating 5,125 and opened in 1948.

On the collegiate level, four Division I programs—two on the Southside and two on the Peninsula—field teams in many sports, including football, basketball, and baseball; three currently play football in the second-tier FCS, while ODU recently moved up to the FBS football. The Southside boasts the Old Dominion Monarchs and the Norfolk State Spartans, both in Norfolk, while the Peninsula features the William &amp; Mary Tribe in Williamsburg and Hampton Pirates in Hampton. W&amp;M is a member of the Colonial Athletic Association. Norfolk State and Hampton, both historically black institutions, compete in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and CAA respectively. ODU joined Conference USA, an FBS football conference, as a full FBS member in 2015. The area also has two Division III programs, one in each subregion—the Virginia Wesleyan Marlins on the border of Virginia Beach and Norfolk, and the Christopher Newport University Captains in Newport News.

Virginia Beach served as home to one soccer team, the Hampton Roads Piranhas, a women&#x27;s team in the W-League from 1995 to 2013. The Piranhas played at the Virginia Beach Sportsplex. The Virginia Beach Sportsplex, seating 11,541 and opened in 1999, contains the central training site for the U.S. women&#x27;s national field hockey team. The Sportsplex was expanded to accommodate the Virginia Destroyers, a franchise in the United Football League which relocated from Orlando. The Destroyers played in Virginia Beach from 2011 to 2012, and won the 2011 league championship. The North American Sand Soccer Championships, a beach soccer tournament, is held annually on the beach in Virginia Beach.

The Norfolk Nighthawks were a charter member of the Arena Football League&#x27;s minor league, af2. They ceased operations in 2003 after their fourth season. Also, the Virginia Beach Mariners of soccer&#x27;s USL First Division were active from 1994 until 2006.

Hampton Roads is from the nearest major sports teams in Washington, D.C., and Raleigh, North Carolina. Another significant issue with the area as a sports market is internal transportation. The metropolitan area is split into two distinct parts by its eponymous harbor; as of 2012, the harbor has only three widely separated road crossings (the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel, Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, and James River Bridge), each with two lanes of traffic in each direction. In addition, the area has two other major tunnels, plus several drawbridges on key highway corridors.

Hampton Roads previously hosted a successful franchise in the American Basketball Association, although it was never a full-time home for that team. Its highest-ranking teams as of 2015 are the Norfolk Admirals of the ECHL, the Norfolk Tides of the IL, and Lionsbridge FC of USL League Two. Virginia is also the most populous state without a major league team playing within its borders, though its northern reaches are served by the Washington clubs — two of which, the NHL&#x27;s Capitals and NFL&#x27;s Washington Commanders, have their operational headquarters and practice facilities in Virginia. Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder, through a separate company, owns two radio stations, WXTG and WXTG-FM, in the Norfolk market. The Hampton Roads television market is ranked 42nd in the U.S.

There have been several failed projects to attract major league teams to Hampton Roads:

* In 1997, Norfolk presented a proposal to bring an expansion hockey team to Hampton Roads, but that initiative failed. The team was going to be called the Hampton Roads Rhinos.
* In 2002, Norfolk presented a proposal to bring the Charlotte Hornets basketball team to southeastern Virginia, but New Orleans won the bid for the team, renaming it the New Orleans Hornets.
* In 2004, Norfolk presented a proposal to bring the Montreal Expos baseball team to the metro area, but Washington, D.C. won the bid for the team, renaming it the Washington Nationals.
* In 2012, there were talks of the Sacramento Kings of the NBA moving to a proposed new arena in Virginia Beach near the Oceanfront.

===Individual sports===

The Hampton Coliseum, seating 10,761 to 13,800 festival seating, hosts the annual Virginia Duals wrestling events, and the annual Hampton Jazz Festival. The arena opened in 1970 and has previously hosted Hampton University basketball along with NBA and NHL preseason exhibition games.

Virginia Beach is home to the East Coast Surfing Championships, an annual contest of more than 100 of the world&#x27;s top professional surfers and an estimated 400 amateur surfers. This is North America&#x27;s oldest surfing contest, and features combined cash prizes of $40,000.

Langley Speedway in Hampton, seating 6,500, hosts stock car races every weekend during spring, summer, and early fall.

The Kingsmill Championship, an event on the LPGA Tour, is contested annually on Mother&#x27;s Day weekend at Kingsmill Resort near Williamsburg.

In 1998, 2001, 2006, 2010, and 2015 the Hampton Roads Sports Commission hosted the AAU Junior Olympics.

===Professional wrestling===

Hampton Roads has hosted many professional wrestling events throughout the years. The Norfolk Scope has served as the site of these events, including Total Nonstop Action Wrestling&#x27;s Destination X, World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Starrcade (1988), World War 3 1995 and 1996, and WWF/WWE&#x27;s The Great American Bash (2004) and the 2011 Slammy Awards. Norfolk Scope was also the site of an infamous episode of WCW Monday Nitro, where several members of the World Wrestling Federation stable D-Generation X literally drove a tank to the entryway of the Scope, thus &quot;invading&quot; the competition. The Hampton Coliseum has also hosted many events, including &quot;RAW&quot;, in April 1998, August 2005, May 2007, January 2008, and July 2011, as well as &quot;SmackDown!&quot; and for &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot; in December 2006. In January 2008, WWE broadcast its first television show taped in high definition from Hampton, Virginia.

The Hampton Roads area is also home to at least one professional wrestling promotion, Vanguard Championship Wrestling, which holds events throughout the region, and has a weekly television show on the local Fox affiliate.

<text>Echinacea is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the daisy family. It has ten species, which are commonly called coneflowers. They are native only in eastern and central North America, where they grow in wet to dry prairies and open wooded areas. They have large, showy heads of composite flowers, blooming in summer. The generic name is derived from the Greek word (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;hedgehog&quot;, due to the spiny central disk. These flowering plants and their parts have different uses. Some species are cultivated in gardens for their showy flowers. Two of the species, &quot;E. tennesseensis&quot; and &quot;E. laevigata&quot;, were formerly listed in the United States as endangered species; &quot;E. tennesseensis&quot; has been delisted due to recovery and &quot;E. laevigata&quot; is now listed as threatened.

&quot;Echinacea purpurea&quot; is used in traditional medicine. Although commonly sold as a dietary supplement, there is insufficient scientific evidence that &quot;Echinacea&quot; products are effective or safe for improving health or treating any disease.

== Description ==

&quot;Echinacea&quot; species are herbaceous, drought-tolerant perennial plants growing up to in height. They grow from taproots, except &quot;E. purpurea&quot;, which grows from a short caudex with fibrous roots. They have erect stems that in most species are unbranched. Both the basal and cauline (stem) leaves are arranged alternately. The leaves are normally hairy with a rough texture, having uniseriate trichomes (1–4 rings of cells), but sometimes they lack hairs. The basal leaves and the lower stem leaves have petioles, and as the leaves progress up the stem the petioles often decrease in length. The leaf blades in different species may have one, three, or five nerves. Some species have linear to lanceolate leaves, and others have elliptic- to ovate-shaped leaves; often the leaves decrease in size as they progress up the stems. Leaf bases gradually increase in width away from the petioles or the bases are rounded to heart shaped. Most species have leaf margins that are entire, but sometimes they are dentate or serrate.

The flowers are collected together into single rounded heads at the ends of long peduncles. The inflorescences have crateriform to shaped involucres which are wide. The phyllaries, or bracts below the flower head, are persistent and number 15–50. The phyllaries are produced in a 2–4 series. The receptacles are hemispheric to conic. The paleae (chaffs on the receptacles of many Asteraceae) have orange to reddish purple ends, and are longer than the disc corollas. The paleae bases partially surrounding the cypselae, and are keeled with the apices abruptly constricted to awn-like tips. The ray florets number 8–21 and the corollas are dark purple to pale pink, white, or yellow. The tubes of the corolla are hairless or sparsely hairy, and the laminae are spreading, reflexed, or drooping in habit and linear to elliptic or obovate in shape. The abaxial faces of the laminae are glabrous or moderately hairy. The flower heads have typically 200–300 fertile, bisexual disc florets but some have more. The corollas are pinkish, greenish, reddish-purple or yellow and have tubes shorter than the throats. The pollen is normally yellow in most species, but usually white in &quot;E. pallida&quot;. The three or four-angled fruits (cypselae), are tan or bicolored with a dark brown band distally. The pappi are persistent and variously crown-shaped with 0 to 4 or more prominent teeth. x = 11.

Like all members of the sunflower family, the flowering structure is a composite inflorescence, with rose-colored (rarely yellow or white) florets arranged in a prominent, somewhat cone-shaped head – &quot;cone-shaped&quot; because the petals of the outer ray florets tend to point downward (are reflexed) once the flower head opens, thus forming a cone. Plants are generally long lived, with distinctive flowers. The common name &quot;coneflower&quot; comes from the characteristic center &quot;cone&quot; at the center of the flower head.

== Taxonomy ==

The first &quot;Echinacea&quot; species were named by European explorers after seeing them in the forests of southeastern North America during the 18th century. The genus &quot;Echinacea&quot; was then formally described by Linnaeus in 1753, and this specimen as one of five species of &quot;Rudbeckia&quot;, &quot;Rudbeckia purpurea&quot;. Conrad Moench subsequently reclassified it in 1794 as the separate but related genus, &quot;Echinacea&quot;, with the single species &quot;Echinacea purpurea&quot;, so that the botanical authority is given as (L.) Moench. In 1818, Nuttall, using the original name, described a variety of &quot;Rudbeckia purpurea&quot;, which he named &quot;Rudbeckia purpurea&quot; var &quot;serotina&quot;. In 1836, De Candolle elevated this variety to a species in its own right, as &quot;Echinacea serotina&quot; (Nutt.) DC, by which time four species of the genus &quot;Echinacea&quot; were recognised.

Historically, there has been much confusion over the taxonomic treatment of the genus, largely due to the ease with which the taxa hybridize with introgression where species ranges overlap, and high morphological variation. Furthermore it was discovered that the type specimen for &quot;Echinacea purpurea&quot; (L) Moench was not the one originally described by Linnaeus, but rather that described by De Candolle as &quot;Echinacea serotina&quot; (Nutt.) DC.

=== Subdivision ===

Many taxonomic treatments of the genus &quot;Echinacea&quot; have recorded varying numbers of subordinate taxa, ranging between 2 and 11. One of the most widely adopted schemes was that of McGregor (1968), which included nine species, of which two, &quot;E. angustifolia&quot; DC and &quot;E. paradoxa&quot; (Norton) Britton, were further divided into two varietals. Treatments that include ten species, differ by the addition of &quot;E. serotina&quot; (Nutt.) DC. Alternative classification include with four species and eight subspecies, and two subgenera with four species, has been proposed, based on morphology alone, but has proved controversial. This recognised subgenus &quot;Echinacea&quot;, with the single species &quot;E. purpurea&quot;, and subgenus &quot;Pallida&quot;, with three species, &quot;E. atrorubens&quot;, &quot;E. laevigata&quot; and &quot;E. pallida&quot;. In this scheme, other taxa are reduced to variety rank, e.g. &quot;E. atrorubens&quot; var. &quot;neglecta&quot;. Subsequently, McGregor&#x27;s classification was preserved in the Flora of North America (2006).

DNA analysis has been applied to determine the number of &quot;Echinacea&quot; species, allowing clear distinctions among species based on chemical differences in root metabolites. The research concluded that of the 40 genetically diverse populations of &quot;Echinacea&quot; studied, there were nine to ten distinct species.

==== Species ====
Plants of the World Online gives nine accepted species, and World Flora Online gives ten:
*&quot;Echinacea angustifolia&quot; – Narrow-leaf coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea atrorubens&quot; – Topeka purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea laevigata&quot; – Smooth coneflower, smooth purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea pallida&quot; – Pale purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea paradoxa&quot; – Yellow coneflower, Bush&#x27;s purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea purpurea&quot; – Purple coneflower, eastern purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea sanguinea&quot; – Sanguine purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea serotina&quot; – Narrow-leaved purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea simulata&quot; – Wavyleaf purple coneflower
*&quot;Echinacea tennesseensis&quot; – Tennessee coneflower
These two databases differ in their treatment of &quot;E. serotina&quot; , the former considering this as a synonym of &quot;E. purpurea&quot; and the latter as a distinct species.

=== Former classification ===

* &quot;Rudbeckia&quot; 
* &quot;Brauneria&quot; (1790)

=== Etymology ===

Moench named the genus &quot;Echinacea&quot;, from the Greek word (&quot;&quot;) for hedgehog or sea-urchin, in recognition that in the seed stage, the cone has spiny projections.

== Distribution and habitat ==

&quot;Echinacea&quot; is restricted to North America, east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the Atlantic drainage area, predominantly the Great Plains and central United States and adjacent areas of Canada. The genus range is from Saskatchewan in the north to almost the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana and Texas in the south, and from the Ohio oak savannas, glades of Tennessee and the Carolinas in the east, to the Rocky Mountain foothills in the west.

== Conservation ==

Natural populations of &quot;Echinacea&quot; are threatened by over-harvesting of wild specimens for the herbal product trade and modification of their habitats by humans. Major reductions in the size of populations of &quot;E. laevigata&quot; and &quot;E. tennesseensis&quot; have led to their classification as endangered species. &quot;E. tennesseensis&quot; had recovered sufficiently by 2011 that it was removed from the list.

== Cultivation ==

Many species of &quot;Echinacea&quot; are cultivated for commercial use, while others, notably &quot;E. purpurea&quot;, &quot;E. angustifolia&quot;, and &quot;E. pallida&quot;, are grown as ornamental plants in gardens. Many cultivars exist, and many of them are asexually propagated to keep them true to type.

== Uses ==

&quot;Echinacea&quot; has long been used as a traditional medicine.

=== History ===

&quot;Echinacea angustifolia&quot; was widely used by the North American Indigenous peoples as folk medicine, with archaeological evidence dating back to the 18th century. Traditional use included external application (insect bites, burns, wounds), chewing of roots (throat and tooth infections) and internal use (cough, pain, snake bites, stomach cramps). Some Plains tribes used &quot;Echinacea&quot; for cold symptoms. The Kiowa used it for coughs and sore throats, the Cheyenne for sore throats, the Pawnee for headaches, and many tribes, including the Lakota, used it as a pain medication. Early European settlers noticed this and began to develop their own uses. According to Wallace Sampson, its modern use for the common cold began when a Swiss herbal supplement maker was told that &quot;Echinacea&quot; was used for cold prevention by Native American tribes who lived in the area of South Dakota. The first preparation was Meyers Blood Purifier (), which was promoted for neuralgia, rattlesnake bites and rheumatism. By the start of the 20th century it was the most common herbal remedy in America. Commercial cultivation began in Germany in the late 1930s, and in Switzerland in 1950, by A. Vogel. Soon chemists and pharmacologists began the task of identifying potentially active ingredients and their properties. These included , cichoric acid, echinacoside, and polysaccharides. Extracts appeared to exhibit immunostimulant properties and were mainly promoted for the prevention and treatment of colds, influenza and sepsis. Despite many different preparations and hundreds of publications, no exact identification of a truly active ingredient has been identified.

=== Infectious diseases ===

A 2014 meta-analysis found weak evidence for &quot;Echinacea&quot; in treating, preventing, or reducing the severity of the common cold. A 2015 meta-analysis found tentative evidence that use of &quot;Echinacea&quot; extracts reduced the risk of repeated respiratory infections.

=== Side effects ===

When taken by mouth, &quot;Echinacea&quot; does not usually cause side effects, but may have undesirable interactions with various drugs prescribed for diseases, such as heart disease, bleeding, and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or psoriasis. Although there are no specific case reports of drug interactions with &quot;Echinacea&quot;, safety about taking &quot;Echinacea&quot; supplements is not well understood, with possibilities that it may cause side effects, such as nausea, stomach upset or diarrhea, and that it may have adverse reactions with other medications. One of the most extensive and systematic studies to review the safety of &quot;Echinacea&quot; products concluded that overall, &quot;adverse events are rare, mild and reversible,&quot; with the most common symptoms being &quot;gastrointestinal and skin-related.&quot; Such side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, itch, and rash. &quot;Echinacea&quot; has also been linked to allergic reactions, including asthma, shortness of breath, and one case of anaphylaxis. Muscle and joint pain has been associated with &quot;Echinacea&quot;, but it may have been caused by cold or flu symptoms for which the &quot;Echinacea&quot; products were administered. There are isolated case reports of rare and idiosyncratic reactions including thrombocytopenic purpura, leucopenia, hepatitis, kidney failure, and atrial fibrillation, although it is not clear that these were due to &quot;Echinacea&quot; itself. Up to 58 drugs or supplements may interact with &quot;Echinacea&quot;.

As a matter of manufacturing safety, one investigation by an independent-consumer testing laboratory found that five of eleven selected retail &quot;Echinacea&quot; products failed quality testing. Four of the failing products contained levels of phenols below the potency level stated on the labels. One failing product was contaminated with lead.

==== Children under 12 years old ====

The European Herbal Medicinal Products Committee (HMPC) and the UK Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee (HMAC) recommended against the use of &quot;Echinacea&quot;-containing products in children under the age of 12. Manufacturers re-labelled all oral &quot;Echinacea&quot; products that had product licenses for children with a warning that they should not be given to children under 12 as a precautionary measure.

==== Pregnancy ====

Although research has not found increased risk of birth defects associated with use of &quot;Echinacea&quot; during the first trimester, it is recommended that pregnant women should avoid &quot;Echinacea&quot; products until stronger safety supporting evidence becomes available.

==== Lactation ====

It is recommended that women breastfeeding should use caution with &quot;Echinacea&quot; products due to insufficient safety information available.

==== General precaution ====

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends precaution about using dietary supplements because some products may not be risk free under certain circumstances or may interact with prescription and over-the-counter medicines.

As with any herbal preparation, individual doses of &quot;Echinacea&quot; may vary significantly in chemical composition. Inconsistent process control in manufactured echinacea products may involve poor inter- and intra-batch homogeneity, species or plant part differences, variable extraction methods, and contamination or adulteration with other products, leading to potential for substantial product variability.

=== Research ===

&quot;Echinacea&quot; products vary widely in composition. They contain different species (&quot;E. purpurea&quot;, &quot;E. angustifolia&quot;, &quot;E. pallida&quot;), different plant segments (roots, flowers, extracts), different preparations (extracts and expressed juice), and different chemical compositions which complicate understanding of a potential effect.
Well-controlled clinical trials are limited and low in quality, with little scientific evidence that &quot;Echinacea&quot; supplement products are useful for treating any disease.

According to Cancer Research UK, &quot;There is no scientific evidence to show that echinacea can help treat, prevent or cure cancer in any way. Some therapists have claimed that echinacea can help relieve side effects from cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but this has not been proven either.&quot;

Although there are multiple scientific reviews and meta-analyses published on the supposed immunological effects of &quot;Echinacea&quot;, there is significant variability of products used among studies, leading to low-quality or no evidence for efficacy and safety, leading to considerable controversy. Consequently, regulatory authorities, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration, have not approved &quot;Echinacea&quot; products as safe and effective for any health or therapeutic purpose.

<text>USS &quot;Biloxi&quot; was a light cruiser of the United States Navy, which were built during World War II. The class was designed as a development of the earlier s, the size of which had been limited by the First London Naval Treaty. The start of the war led to the dissolution of the treaty system, but the dramatic need for new vessels precluded a new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s used the same hull as their predecessors, but were significantly heavier. The &quot;Cleveland&quot;s carried a main battery of twelve guns in four three-gun turrets, along with a secondary armament of twelve  dual-purpose guns. They had a top speed of .

The ship was laid down on 9 July 1941 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. and launched on 23 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Katharine G. Braun, wife of the Mayor of Biloxi. She was commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 31 August 1943, with Captain Daniel M. McGurl in command.
==Design==

The &quot;Cleveland&quot;-class light cruisers traced their origin to design work done in the late 1930s; at the time, light cruiser displacement was limited to by the Second London Naval Treaty. Following the start of World War II in September 1939, Britain announced it would suspend the treaty for the duration of the conflict, a decision the US Navy quickly followed. Though still neutral, the United States recognized that war was likely and the urgent need for additional ships ruled out an entirely new design, so the &quot;Cleveland&quot;s were a close development of the earlier s, the chief difference being the substitution of a two-gun dual-purpose gun mount for one of the main battery gun turrets.

&quot;Biloxi&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . Her crew numbered 1285 officers and enlisted men. The ship was fitted with a pair of aircraft catapults and an initial complement of four Curtiss SO3C seaplanes.

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 6 in /47-caliber Mark 16 guns in four 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Two were placed forward in a superfiring pair; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of twelve /38-caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in twin turrets. Two of these were placed on the centerline, one directly behind the forward main turrets and the other just forward of the aft turrets. Two more were placed abreast of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. Anti-aircraft defense consisted of twenty-four Bofors guns in four quadruple and four double mounts and twenty-one Oerlikon guns in single mounts.

The ship&#x27;s belt armor ranged in thickness from , with the thicker section amidships where it protected the ammunition magazines and propulsion machinery spaces. Her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and sides and tops, and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;Biloxi&quot; was laid down on 9 July 1941 at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. shipyard in Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 23 February 1943, by which time the United States had entered World War II. Fitting-out was completed quickly, and the ship was commissioned on 31 August. Her first commanding officer was Captain Daniel M. McGurl. Final fitting out continued until 17 September, when she departed for a shakedown cruise to evaluate the vessel. The trip was restricted to Chesapeake Bay, but it included training for launching and recovering her seaplanes, shooting tests to evaluate the structural strength of the main battery guns, and anti-aircraft shooting practice. &quot;Biloxi&quot; then departed for a longer training cruise on 29 September, in company with the destroyer . The ships steamed to Trinidad in the Caribbean Sea, and while en route, one of the cruiser&#x27;s seaplanes crashed while trying to land, though both crewmen were rescued. The ships then sank the still-floating wreck to avoid causing a navigation hazard.

The two ships reached Trinidad on 3 October, and &quot;Biloxi&quot; began a series of intensive combat training exercises that lasted for two weeks. These covered a range of activities the crew needed to master before they were sent to war, including day and night fighting, refueling at sea, and directing combat air patrol fighters to intercept enemy aircraft. The ship&#x27;s radars also needed to be calibrated properly. On 18 October, &quot;Biloxi&quot; sailed north to the Norfolk Navy Yard for maintenance and repairs. She then made a brief visit to Rockland, Maine, where tests to confirm the calibration of her compasses and gyroscopes were carried out. On 20 November, she departed the East Coast of the United States for the Panama Canal. Four days later, she passed through the canal and turned north for San Francisco, arriving on 4 December. The crew made preparations for deployment west, including loading supplies and transferring the SO3C seaplanes ashore and loading a pair of Vought OS2U Kingfishers in their place. On 7 December, she departed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

&quot;Biloxi&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 December. Beginning on the 15th, she engaged in shore bombardment practice with the heavy cruiser on Kahoolawe Island; these exercises continued until 19 December. &quot;Biloxi&quot; then departed for San Francisco the following day. After arriving on 24 December, she moved to San Pedro for repairs. During this period, she was assigned to 5th Fleet. Work on the ship was completed by the end of the year, and on 1 January 1944, she joined a bombardment unit tha included the battleship , the cruisers and , and two destroyers for more shooting practice at San Clemente Island. She thereafter returned to San Pedro to replenish supplies and fuel.

===Pacific War operations===
==== Marshall Islands, January–February 1944====
&quot;Biloxi&quot; put to sea on 13 January and, after joining Task Group (TG) 53.5 in Hawaii, sailed for the Marshall Islands. In company with &quot;Louisville&quot;, &quot;Mobile&quot;, , and six destroyers, the light cruiser approached Wotje early in the morning on 30 January. After launching her Kingfisher spotter aircraft, she carried out a neutralizing bombardment of the Japanese air base on Wotje from dawn until noon. Enemy shore batteries fired back intermittently, one of which straddled &quot;Biloxi&quot;. A later ricochet hit the superstructure above the signal bridge but fortunately did not explode.

Over the next two days, the light cruiser participated in several more shore bombardment missions against Roi Island in support of amphibious landings made by the Northern Attack Force. She then screened three escort carriers for five days before entering Majuro lagoon on the 7th to refuel.

On 12 January, &quot;Biloxi&quot; joined TG 58.1, built around the carriers , , and , and sailed west for a carrier raid against the Japanese base at Truk Lagoon in the central Pacific. Intended to cover the landings on Eniwetok and to distract the Japanese from Allied operations in New Guinea, &quot;Operation Hailstone&quot; began on 16 February when the carriers struck enemy airfields on Truk. After a second strike during the morning of the 17th, the task group retired east to refuel. Following the departure of &quot;Enterprise&quot; later that day, the remaining warships were shifted into TG 58.2 and steamed northwest for a strike against Saipan.

====Marianas, February –June 1944====
On 19 February, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft closed the task group and was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. During this action, a salvo of anti-aircraft shells landed 500 yards off &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s starboard bow. Although the task group hoped they had avoided enemy detection, it was clear by the evening of the 21st that the Japanese were tracking them. Starting at 23:00 that evening, and continuing until 10:00 the following morning, the task group was attacked by three waves of Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; land-attack bombers. A total of nineteen bombers attacked at night and another five closed the task group in the morning. None penetrated the surface ship screen and eleven were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Following air strikes against Saipan, the task group returned to Majuro on the 26th.

&quot;Biloxi&quot; rearmed and replenished and got underway on 7 March in company with &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, two other light cruisers and eight destroyers. Heading south, the task group crossed the equator, at which time Neptune ceremonies were held and &quot;Biloxi&quot; made loyal shellbacks out of some 1,139 polywogs, and arrived at Espiritu Santo on the 11th. There, the warships loaded supplies and provisions before proceeding to Emirau in the Bismarck Archipelago. The light cruiser then covered the Marine landings on the 20th and again on the 25th.

Returning north the next day, the task group was joined by , a fourth light cruiser, and nine more destroyers before conducting a raid against Japanese forces in the western Carolines. On 30 March, &quot;Biloxi&quot; covered the carriers during strikes on Palau. One &quot;Betty&quot; was shot down as it tried to close the formation that morning. Later that night, gun crews spotted a single Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; carrier bomber flying overhead and fired several 5 inch batteries in a vain attempt to shoot it down. After observing the destruction of three Japanese patrol craft by two destroyers off Woleai the next day, the light cruiser steamed back to Majuro, arriving there on 6 April.

Following a week of upkeep, &quot;Biloxi&quot; sortied on 13 April with TG 58.1 for the Hollandia operation. On 21 April, she covered the carriers as they launched strikes against enemy aircraft and installations at Sawar, Wakde, and Sarmi in New Guinea. At 14:56 that afternoon, the light cruiser launched two Kingfishers to rescue the crew of a ditched Grumman TBF Avenger. Neither floatplane found the aircraft crew, however, and one of the floatplanes later ran out of fuel. Lt.(jg) H. Jolly landed the aircraft on the water and the crew was rescued by .

That evening, &quot;Biloxi&quot;, two other light cruisers and five destroyers closed Wakde and Sawar. Fire was opened at 01:15 on the 22nd against aircraft on Wakde and ceased at 02:25 after firing at the airfield and supply dumps on Sawar. Rejoining the carriers later that morning, &quot;Biloxi&quot; helped screen them until returning to Manus on 28 April.

The task group headed north and struck the Japanese base at Truk on 29 April. &quot;Biloxi&quot; covered the carriers during these strikes and those launched against Ponape in the Caroline Islands the next day. She also observed battleships bombarding Ponape on 1 May. The warships steamed to the Marshalls, arriving in Kwajalein lagoon on the 4th. The light cruiser then loaded fuel, ammunition and supplies in preparation for &quot;Operation Forager&quot;, the planned liberation of the Mariana Islands.

Tasked with eliminating Japanese air power in the Marianas, the 15 fleet carriers of Task Force 58 planned to attack airfields on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. They also prepared for a major fleet battle if the Japanese carriers attempted to interfere with the American transports. &quot;Biloxi&quot; joined TG 58.2, which was built around the carriers , , , and and covered the carriers during air strikes against Saipan and Tinian on the 12th. Several enemy raids were driven off by aircraft or shot down by anti-aircraft fire, including one Japanese aircraft shot down &quot;in brilliant flames&quot; by the destroyer .

The light cruiser screened the carriers during the landing operations on Saipan beginning on the 15th. The next day, the task group heard reports that a large Japanese force was closing the Marianas from the Philippines. After rendezvous with the other three carrier groups about noon on 18 June, the warships took up a patrol station some west of Saipan. From that position, on the southern flank of the carrier forces, &quot;Biloxi&quot; participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

====Battle of the Philippine Sea, 19–20 June 1944====

Although American search aircraft could not find the approaching enemy carriers, the presence of reconnaissance aircraft near the American carriers indicated the Japanese had found them. Late in the morning of 19 June, the first of 14 enemy raids registered on radar and began closing the task force. Most of these raids were destroyed or broken up by American fighters, severely disrupting the ensuing Japanese attacks, but several raids did get through.

Around noon, six Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bombers evaded the American fighters and closed TG 58.2. &quot;Biloxi&quot;, along with several other escorts, fired on the two attacking &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; and both were shot down. At least four more Judys pounced on the task group later that afternoon but all were shot down by anti-aircraft fire without inflicting any damage. These were but a small portion of the 300 or so Japanese aircraft lost in the battle dubbed the &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.&quot;

The next day, the American task force discovered the Japanese carrier force had retired west during the night. Late in the day, a sighting report at 16:13 led to a last-ditch 206-aircraft strike. These aircraft caught the retreating Japanese at dusk and sank the light carrier and damaged another. The American aircraft then flew east for a difficult night landing. Many were later ditched owing to darkness or lack of fuel and &quot;Biloxi&quot; joined other warships in recovering crews from the water. After a futile stern chase of the Japanese on the 21st, the American warships gave up the pursuit and retired, arriving at Eniwetok on 27 June.

====Marianas, June–July 1944====
The light cruiser stayed in the Marshalls only briefly, sailing west with TG 58.1 to the Bonin Islands on 30 June. She screened the carriers , and while they launched fighter sweeps and other strikes against Iwo Jima on 3 July. &quot;Biloxi&quot; then joined a bombardment group of four light cruisers and seven destroyers and closed Iwo Jima the following day.

Just as firing began at 14:45, three Japanese fighters took off from Iwo Jima and closed the American Kingfisher spotter aircraft. Although &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s Kingfisher safely retreated under the protection of friendly anti-aircraft fire, &quot;Santa Fe&#x27;s&quot; spotter aircraft was heavily damaged by enemy fire and forced to make an emergency landing. The crew was later rescued by . After the warships drove off the attacking Japanese fighters, the bombardment resumed and the observation aircraft reported target areas well covered, with many fires burning when the bombardment group retired.

After refueling at sea, the light cruiser spent the next two weeks screening the carriers during air strikes against Guam and Rota in the Marianas. On 24 July, the task group sailed south for strikes against Palau, Yap, and Ulithi. Japanese air operations during both these operations were limited and no enemy aircraft closed the task group.

On the morning of 27 July, &quot;Biloxi&quot; catapulted two Kingfishers to rescue a pilot sighted in the water just off the southwest tip of Yap Island. One Kingfisher, flown by Lt(jg). R. Dana, spotted the pilot at 09:05 and was able to land just outside the reef line surrounding the island. A Japanese anti-aircraft gun began firing at the Kingfisher, but was soon silenced by four circling American fighters. The downed flier managed to paddle his raft through the breaking swells and across the reef where he collapsed from exhaustion. Lt(jg). Dana taxied between the raft and the reef and managed to pull the pilot in with a line. He took off at 09:40 and successfully returned to the task group later that morning.

====Volcano and Ryukyu Islands, July–October 1944====

Following one more air strike on 28 July, heavy rain squalls and poor weather canceled further strikes and the task group turned for the Mariana Islands. After a quick replenishment stop at Saipan on 2 August, the task group steamed west for a strike against the Bonin and Volcano Islands. During a fighter sweep on 4 August, friendly aircraft reported a small enemy task group in the area. Late that afternoon, &quot;Biloxi&quot;, three other cruisers and seven destroyers closed the Bonins for an anti-shipping sweep. After the destroyers and destroyed a small sampan, the cruisers picked up a Japanese convoy on radar north of Muko Jima. Owing to the danger of enemy torpedo attack, the cruisers kept their distance and fired at long range. Their accurate gunfire quickly damaged and eventually sank escort destroyer and collier &quot;Ryuko Maru&quot;.

At 04:00 the following morning, while preparing for a bombardment mission against Ani and Chichi Jima, a Japanese &quot;Betty&quot; closed from the stern and passed over the light cruiser. Shortly thereafter a heavy underwater explosion, probably a torpedo, detonated in &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s wake. The blast severely shook the warship but did no damage. The bombardment mission was carried out as planned later that morning and the cruisers rejoined the carriers that afternoon.

The task group then sailed east and arrived at Eniwetok on 9 August. After &quot;Biloxi&quot; refueled alongside the oiler , she moved to a berth in the lagoon to take on stores and provisions. The crew also received three weeks of rest and recreation.

Assigned to TG 38.4, the light cruiser got underway on 28 August in company with the carriers , and , the cruiser , and 12 destroyers. Steaming west, the task group closed the Bonins to neutralize Japanese installations there in advance of upcoming operations against Palau and the Philippines.

After &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; launched a fighter sweep on the 31st, the cruisers closed and bombarded Chichi Jima. During that evolution, the warships were approached by a Japanese &quot;Betty&quot; but they drove the bomber off with anti-aircraft fire. The next day, the warships closed Iwo Jima and fired at targets ashore. During this operation, &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s crew saw friendly aircraft strafing an enemy patrol craft. The destroyer then closed the target and sank it with gunfire. At 15:00 that afternoon, a damaged Army B-24D Liberator four-engined bomber appeared over the task group and eleven crew members bailed out. Ten were rescued in the water and, despite extensive searches, the warships did not find the eleventh man. The task group then sailed east and moored at Saipan anchorage on 4 September.

The warships continued a fast pace of operations by sailing south to Yap the next day. &quot;Biloxi&quot; conducted an especially good bombardment mission during the morning of 7 September, starting numerous fires in a vehicle depot and an oil storage building. The light cruiser then took up a position to cover the carriers and screened them during air strikes against Palau between 10 and 15 September. During this time, &quot;Biloxi&quot; also launched Kingfishers to fly close in anti-submarine patrol. Following the amphibious landings on Palau on the 15th, the light cruiser headed to the Admiralty Islands for upkeep.

While en route, &quot;Biloxi&quot; crossed the equator on 20 September. According to the war diarist, &quot;King Neptune, Davy Jones, and all the Royal Court were received aboard and dispensed justice with their customary ruthless and bloodthirsty manner. Among the initiates was the XO, Commander E.F. McDaniel, who until today had evaded His Majesty during 21 years of naval service. He was punished accordingly.&quot; The warship arrived at Manus the next day.

After taking on supplies and ammunition, &quot;Biloxi&quot; sailed to Kossol Passage on 24 September and joined TG 38.1. Once joined there by the other fast carriers of Task Force 38, the force proceeded west to Okinawa on 8 October. Arriving off the Ryukyu Islands two days later, &quot;Biloxi&quot; screened the carriers as they struck airfields and other installations ashore. That morning, two Kingfishers catapulted off the light cruiser to search for a downed pilot from &quot;Franklin&quot;. One aircraft landed and recovered the pilot but, owing to rough seas, the OS2U capsized during takeoff. Rather than risk the second floatplane—her last working aircraft—&quot;Biloxi&quot; allowed the two pilots to be rescued by the submarine .

The carriers then shifted to Formosa on 12 October for two days of heavy attacks against Japanese airfields. Just before sunset on the 13th, seven &quot;Betty&quot; bombers appeared out of a rain squall and rapidly closed the carriers. &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s forward 6-inch turrets as well as her 5-inch and 40-mm batteries took five of these aircraft under fire as they passed down her port side. One aircraft broke into flames and, after &quot;Biloxi&quot; checked fire to avoid hitting two nearby destroyers, all five were shot down by other warships in the formation.

====Philippines, October 1944–January 1945====

Between 14 and 19 October, the light cruiser covered the carriers as they struck airfields on Luzon in preparation for the Leyte landings on 20th. Numerous small enemy raids plagued the task group but they inflicted no damage. On the 19th, &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s remaining OS2U, accompanied by a seaplane from &quot;New Orleans&quot;, successfully picked up the crew of a crashed dive bomber and returned them to &quot;Franklin&quot;.

After covering Leyte strikes between 20 and 22 October, &quot;Biloxi&quot; detached and joined TG 38.2 built around , &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;, &quot;Cabot&quot;, and . Upon word that three groups of Japanese warships were closing the Philippines, this force concentrated east of Samar. On 24 October, during the second day of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, aircraft from &quot;Intrepid&quot; and &quot;Cabot&quot; took part in attacks that sank the south of Luzon. Other air attacks damage two other battleships.

That night, the task group steamed north off Cape Engano to hunt for fleeing enemy carriers, five of which are disposed of by air strikes the following day. Later that evening the American warships turned south in an attempt to catch a second group of retiring Japanese warships. Just after midnight on the 26th, &quot;Biloxi&quot; and four other cruisers and destroyers picked up a surface contact near San Bernardino Strait. The three cruisers quickly opened fire, destroying the in a blinding explosion shortly thereafter. &quot;Nowaki&quot; had aboard her all of the survivors from the Tone-class heavy cruiser &quot;Chikuma&quot;, which had been sunk at the end of the Battle off Samar. As a result, a total of approximately 1,400 officers and men went down with her in this one action

On 28 October, TG 38.2 returned to launching air strikes against Luzon airfields and Japanese shipping in Manila Bay. Poor weather hampered aircraft recovery on the 29th, and the evening was spent rescuing ditched airmen. Following a withdrawal to refuel and receive replacement aircraft, the task group carried out two more rounds of Luzon strikes in the first weeks of November. These attacks pounded Japanese shipping and port facilities at Manila and central Luzon, sinking half a dozen light warships and over a dozen cargo ships and auxiliaries.

On the 15th, &quot;Biloxi&quot; departed the Philippines and steamed east to Ulithi. Arriving there two days later, she received much needed repairs and replenishment. &quot;Biloxi&quot; also recovered pilot Lt.(jg) Dana, who related an exciting cruise in &quot;Sterlet&quot; during which time the submarine sank at least two enemy cargo ships. While at Ulithi on 20 November, &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s crew experienced the Japanese kaiten attack on the anchorage. All five midget submarines were lost in the attack, though not before the Japanese torpedoes damaged and eventually sank the tanker .

On 22 November, &quot;Biloxi&quot; joined TG 38.3 for another set of air strikes against Luzon. While carrier aircraft attacked enemy coastal shipping on the 25th, the light cruiser helped the task group fight off Japanese kamikazes. Numerous raids breached friendly fighter defenses that day and five American carriers were damaged, forcing the task group to retire from the area.

The carriers returned to the Philippines on 13 December and, in addition to air strikes in support of the Mindoro landings, they also launched special night raids against Japanese airfields. These attacks prevented enemy kamikaze dive bombers (called &quot;green hornets&quot;) from launching the coordinated attacks that had plagued the American task groups in late November.

On 18 December, &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s task force encountered a typhoon northeast of Samar and suffered heavy damage. In addition to the loss of three destroyers, many other warships were damaged and &quot;Biloxi&quot; herself lost an OS2U washed overboard. After spending the next few days searching for survivors, the light cruiser steamed to Ulithi on the 24th and remained there for the next week.

&quot;Biloxi&quot; put to sea with TG 38.3 on 30 December, intending to strike Formosa, Nansei Shoto, and northern Luzon. The task group, built around the carriers , and launched the first strike against Formosa on 3 January 1945. The weather quickly worsened, however, and many of the planned attacks were canceled. The carriers steamed back south and, when the weather cleared on the 6th, blanketed Luzon with aircraft in support of bombardment and amphibious operations in Lingayen Gulf. These attacks did not achieve a lot of success, as enemy aircraft were carefully hidden and camouflaged, and the task group shifted strikes to airfields on Formosa, in the Ryukyus, and the Pescadores.

During the evening of 9 January, the task group passed through Bashi Channel of Luzon Strait and began a high speed run south. Two days later, carrier aviators struck targets between Cam Rahn Bay and Cape Varella, hitting many ground installations and virtually annihilating a coastal convoy north of Qui Nhơn. Nine Japanese ships were sunk in that attack, and another 13 were damaged. After retired to refuel, a task made more difficult owing to typhoon passing through area, the carriers shifted north to attack Hainan and Hong Kong. The following day, S1c Daniel A. Little was swept overboard by a wave and drowned. This was the first loss of life suffered by &quot;Biloxi&quot;″s crew.

After refueling, the task group passed through Balintang Channel and conducted strikes against airfields on Formosa on 21 January. Around midday, Japanese kamikazes began attacking in increasing numbers and, in successive waves, two aircraft crashed into the carrier &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and another damaged the destroyer . That evening, &quot;Biloxi&quot; detached to escort the two damaged warships to Ulithi, arriving there on the 26th.

====Battle of Iwo Jima====
On 10 February, &quot;Biloxi&quot; joined TG 58.4 and sailed for operations against Iwo Jima. Following carrier-launched fighter sweeps against Japanese airfields in the Tokyo area, the task group closed Iwo Jima to support landing operations. During the morning of 19 February, &quot;Biloxi&quot; provided naval gunfire support for the troops ashore. She then shifted to harassing fire that evening. This pattern of operations continued until the 21st when 5 inch mount #6 fired into the barrels of gun mount #5, slightly injuring several sailors and destroying the latter mount.

Despite the damage, &quot;Biloxi&quot; then rejoined TG 58.4 and returned to the Tokyo area to attack aircraft factories and airfields starting on the 25th. Increasingly heavy weather limited and then canceled strikes that afternoon and the force retired south. After hitting ground installations, airfields and shipping at Okinawa, the task group split up and &quot;Biloxi&quot; steamed to Ulithi, arriving there on 1 March. She replenished, loaded ammunition and repaired mount #5.

Biloxi then departed from Iwo Jima and headed to Ulithi for repairs. Biloxi together with her sister ships Santa Fe and Mobile protect the USS Franklin (CV-13). On 19 March 1945, Franklin was hit by 2 bombs and listed 13 degrees to starboard side. Biloxi together with her sister ships, protecting the Franklin and helped saving the survivors on the carrier. Biloxi lowered her whaleboats to help the Big Ben to save 270 sailors. After this event, her captain was awarded with the Silver Star. Heavy cruiser Pittsburgh towed the Franklin until Franklin got to Ulithi on 22 March 1945.

====End of the war====
&quot;Biloxi&quot; stayed in Ulithi until 23rd March. After receiving battle repairs alongside , the light cruiser continued east, arriving at San Francisco via Pearl Harbor on 11 May while escorting the USS Franklin (CV-13). Moving into the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation yard the warship received three weeks of long overdue repairs and machinery maintenance. Following completion of this work on 6 July, &quot;Biloxi&quot; conducted two weeks of post overhaul checks and refresher training out of San Diego and San Clemente. These evolutions were disrupted on 14 July when a water feed line ruptured in the aft fire room, flashed into steam and burned eight men, none seriously.

Returning west on 19 July, &quot;Biloxi&quot; practiced shore bombardment exercises in Hawaii before departing Pearl Harbor on 2 August. While en route to Ulithi, the warship conducted a long range shore bombardment of Wake on 8 August, primarily to train her gunners for upcoming operations against Japan. After a stop at Ulithi on 12 August, she refueled and headed for Leyte, arriving in San Pedro Bay on 14th. While anchored there, the crew heard the Japanese surrender announcement at 08:15 the following morning.

&quot;Biloxi&quot; received nine battle stars for her service in the Pacific during World War II.

===Post-war career===
Departing the Philippines for Okinawa on 20 August, the light cruiser arrived there three days later and spent the next three weeks awaiting orders. Putting to sea on 16 September, &quot;Biloxi&quot; proceeded to Nagasaki, Japan, to evacuate POWs. Arriving there on the 18th, her crew saw the damage caused by the atomic bomb and took on 11 U.S., 17 British, one Australian, one Canadian, and 187 Dutch &quot;recovered Allied military personnel.&quot; These men were delivered to Okinawa on 21 September. Steaming back to Japan, the warship made stops at Nagasaki, Wakayama, and Hiro Wan as the American Occupation Forces consolidated their positions ashore. During October, some officers from ships&#x27; company took part in inspections of surviving Japanese shipping at Kure. Underway on 9 November, &quot;Biloxi&quot; picked up passengers at Okinawa on the 11th, before sailing to Pearl Harbor and then San Francisco, arriving at the latter port on 27 November.

The warship moved to Port Angeles, Washington, on 15 January 1946 and reported for inactivation. On 18 May 1946 she was placed in commission in reserve at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, and on 29 October 1946 went out of commission in reserve. Her name stricken from the Navy List on 1 December 1961, and she was sold for scrap to Puget Sound Towing &amp; Barge Co. on 29 March 1962.

The cruiser&#x27;s superstructure was set aside and erected in the Guice Park near the Biloxi Small Craft Harbor, on Beach Boulevard (U.S. Highway 90) just east of the Hard Rock Casino, where it still stands today. The ship&#x27;s bell is housed in the lobby of the Biloxi Maritime and Seafood Museum.

<text>Ginger ale is a carbonated soft drink flavoured with ginger. It is consumed on its own or used as a mixer, often with spirit-based drinks. There are two main types of ginger ale. The golden style is credited to the Irish doctor Thomas Joseph Cantrell. The dry style (also called the pale style), a paler drink with a much milder ginger flavour, was created by Canadian John McLaughlin.

==History==

Thomas Joseph Cantrell, an Irish apothecary and surgeon, manufactured the first ginger ale in Belfast, Ireland, in the 1850s. This was the older golden style fermented ginger ale, dark coloured, generally sweet to taste, with a strong ginger spice flavour, which he marketed through local beverage manufacturer Grattan and Company. Grattan embossed the slogan &quot;The Original Makers of Ginger Ale&quot; on its bottles. Ginger ale is transparent, whereas ginger beer, a stronger tasting product, is often cloudy due to the residues of brewing.

Dry ginger ale was created by Canadian John J. McLaughlin, a chemist and pharmacist. Having established a soda water bottling plant in 1890, McLaughlin began developing flavour extracts to add to the water in 1904. That year, he introduced &quot;Pale Dry Ginger Ale&quot;, the bubbly drink that would be patented in 1907 as &quot;Canada Dry Ginger Ale&quot;. A success, Canada Dry products were accepted by appointment to the Vice-Regal Household of the Governor General of Canada. The dry-style also became popular in the United States during the Prohibition era, when it was used as a mixer for alcoholic beverages.

===Ingredients===
Traditional ginger ale is fermented from a microbial starter culture (yeast or ginger bug), sugar, fresh ginger root, other flavourings and water. Ginger bug can be derived from ginger beer plant containing &quot;Saccharomyces florentinus&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus hilgardii&quot; or fresh ginger root containing &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; bacteria and wild yeast. The carbonation comes from the yeast fermentation as opposed to carbonating the finished product. Ethanol, as a byproduct of fermentation, will be present in the ginger ale but can be controlled by modifying fermentation time.

Commercial ginger ale commonly contains carbonated water, sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial or natural ginger-flavour. Ginger content is often listed on labels in a general &quot;natural aroma&quot; or &quot;natural flavouring&quot; statement, to preserve secrecy of the complex proprietary mix of spices, fruits and other flavours used; lemon, lime, and cane sugar are the most common ingredients. Pineapple and honey are also occasionally used.

== Processing ==
=== Fermentation ===
Traditional ginger ale is fermented using ginger, yeast, water, sugar, and possibly other flavourings. A ginger bug – a slurry of ginger and sugar used to propagate the yeast and bacteria found on the ginger skin – may be used in place of commercial yeast. Sugar is not added simply for sweetness; ginger&#x27;s low natural sugar content (1.7g sugar/100g) does not contain enough to complete fermentation. As with other fermented beverages, sugar is fermented by the yeast into ethanol and carbon dioxide, both retained during brewing in an airtight container.

=== Artificial carbonation===
Rather than ferment their product, most commercial ginger ale bottlers will carbonate their soda by chilling the water to a low temperature to allow more carbon dioxide to be dissolved. Then, alkaline compounds such as sodium bicarbonate may be added to reduce acidity. Lastly, carbon dioxide is added and slightly over-pressurized to facilitate movement into storage and the filling machine.

==Uses==
=== As a drink ===
Ginger ale is popular both as a soft drink and a mixer in cocktails and punch. It is sometimes used by non-drinkers or in the performing arts as a non-alcoholic substitute for champagne or beer, since the beverages resemble each other in appearance. Ginger ale is also added to beer to make shandy.

===As a stomach pain palliative===
Ginger ale, as with other ginger products and other non-ginger-flavoured carbonated beverages, have been used as a home remedy for indigestion or motion sickness. Some people believe that flat ginger ale is preferred.

== Nutrition ==
Ginger ale is usually acceptable for people on a clear liquid diet. It is generally high in sugar, with commercial varieties containing around 10 g of sugar per 100 ml.

==Variations==
=== Ginger ale vs ginger beer ===

Ginger ale and ginger beer are similar beverages, however, there are clear differences during the process. Ginger beer originated in England in the 1800s while ginger ale was founded in Ireland approximately 50 years later before it was modernized in 1907 by John McLaughlin. Original ginger beer contains 11% alcohol, but modern ginger beer contains less than 0.5% alcohol while modern ginger ale has absolutely no alcohol content. Ginger beer is brewed with natural ginger, lemon juice, sugar and it is fermented with a ginger beer plant culture (mainly &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;). The fermentation of the &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; produces a cloudy appearance, stronger-tasting and spicier flavour compared to ginger ale. Other differences between ginger ale and ginger beer are in terms of taste and aroma. Whilst ginger ale is mellow and smells sweet, ginger beer has a spicy whiff and gingery taste.

=== Other flavours ===

Dry ginger ale is also sold with a mint flavouring added. Some mint ginger ale brands have an artificial green colour added, while others are clear. Canada Dry has introduced a line of ginger ale mixed with green tea and one mixed with lemonade.

==Manufacturers==
Vernors, Blenheim, A-Treat, Bull&#x27;s Head, Chelmsford, Buffalo Rock, Sussex and Red Rock are brands of golden ginger ale. Canada Dry, and Seagram&#x27;s, both Canadian companies, and Schweppes, are major brands of dry ginger ale.

===North America===
American brands include Canfield&#x27;s, Hansen Natural, Vernors, Buffalo Rock, Boylan Bottling Company, Polar Beverages, Ale-8-One, Blenheim, Foxon Park, Fitz&#x27;s, Sprecher, Market Basket/Chelmsford, Red Rock, Reed&#x27;s Ginger Brew, Chek (River of Dreams), Shasta, and in Canada; Sussex Golden Ginger Ale.

Vernors is a flavoured golden ginger ale aged for three years in oak barrels before bottling. It was the first U.S. soft drink, originating in 1866, although it was modelled on imported Irish ginger beers. In Detroit, Michigan, a drink made with vanilla ice cream and Vernors ginger ale is called a Boston cooler.

<doc id="193389" wikidata="Q1259155" url="?curid=193389" title="Monoimus">
<text>Monoimus (lived somewhere between 150 - 210 CE) was an Arab gnostic (Arabic name probably &quot;Mun&#x27;im&quot; منعم), who was known only from one account in Theodoret (&quot;Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium&quot; i. 18) until a lost work of anti-heretical writings (&quot;Refutation of All Heresies&quot;, book 8, chapter V) by Hippolytus was found. He is known for coining the usage of the word Monad in a Gnostic context. Hippolytus claims that Monoimus was a follower of Tatian, and that his cosmological system was derived from that of the Pythagoreans, which indeed seems probable. But it was also clearly inspired by Christianity, monism and Gnosticism.

According to Monoimus, the world is created from the Monad (or iota, or Yod meaning &quot;one horn&quot;), a tittle that brings forth the duad, triad, tetrad, pentad, hexad, heptad, ogdoad, ennead, up to ten, producing a decad. He thus possibly identifies the gnostic aeons with the first elements of the Pythagorean cosmology. He identifies these divisions of different entities with the description of creation in Genesis. This description from Hippolytus also corresponds to two versions of a text called &quot;Epistle of Eugnostos&quot; found in Nag Hammadi, where the same monad to decad relationship is described. (&quot;Eugnostos&quot; in turn, has apparent resemblances to the gnostic text &quot;The Sophia of Jesus Christ&quot;, where the word &quot;monad&quot; appears again.)

==Doctrine==
Monoimus is famous for his quote about the unity of God and man (from Hippolytus):

This idea resembles the viewpoint of the much later Sufi Ibn Arabi, but no connection between the two is known. The starting point is the ascription in the New Testament of the work of creation to the Son of Man, whence it was inferred that the first principle was properly called Man. It follows that it is a mistake to look for God in creation; we must seek Him in ourselves, and can best find Him by the study of the involuntary operations of our own soul. The relation between the &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;Son of Man&quot; exists from beyond time. The latter is derived from the former, but, it would seem, by an immediate and eternal necessity of His nature, just as from fire is necessarily derived the light which renders it visible. Thus, concerning the first principle, the Scriptures speak both of a &quot;being&quot; and a &quot;becoming&quot; (&quot;ēn kai egeneto&quot;), the first word properly applying to the &quot;Man,&quot; the second to the &quot;Son of Man.&quot; in order to illustrate how in this first principle are combined unity and multiplicity, perfect simplicity with the most contradictory attributes, we are referred to the Greek letter ι, the single stroke of which represents units; and which also represents the number ten. Then again from the units all other numbers flow. The process of creation is further illustrated by a mathematical theory of the generation from numbers of the regular solids, and from those the elementary bodies are supposed to be formed. A type of the activity of the Son of Man, who works all the transformations of nature, is found in Moses&#x27; rod; which was also an iota, a single branch, but having a tenfold operation. The speculations of Monoimus, as reported to us, only relate to the work of creation; we are not told whether he had any theory as to the problem of redemption.

The use made by Monoimus of the phrases &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;Son of Man&quot; reminds us of the system of the Naassenes (Hippol. &quot;Ref&quot;. § 7), and a closer examination shows that this is no chance coincidence, and that Monoimus is really to be referred to that sect, although Hippolytus himself has classed them separately; for Monoimus describes his first principle as bisexual, and applies to it the titles &quot;Father, Mother, the two immortal names,&quot; words taken out of a Naassene hymn. But there is a common source of this language in the &quot;Apophasis Megale&quot; of Simon, this passage also being clearly the original of the description given by Monoimus of the contradictory attributes of his first principle. Further traces of the obligations of Monoimus to Simon are found in the reference to the six powers instrumental in creation, which answer to Simon&#x27;s six &quot;roots,&quot; while a similar indebtedness to Simon on the part of the Naassene writer in Hippolytus is found on comparing the anatomical speculations connected with the name Eden (v. 9; vi. 14). A more doubtful question is whether there be any relation of obligation between Monoimus and the Clementine Homilies, there being in both a contrast drawn between the &quot;Son of Man&quot; and those who are &quot;born of women&quot; (&quot;Hom&quot;. ii. 17). Monoimus has mysteries in connexion with the number 14, showing that he attached importance to Paschal celebration.

<doc id="193398" wikidata="Q376680" url="?curid=193398" title="Traumatology">
<text>In medicine, traumatology (from Greek &quot;trauma&quot;, meaning injury or wound) is the study of wounds and injuries caused by accidents or violence to a person, and the surgical therapy and repair of the damage. Traumatology is a branch of medicine. It is often considered a subset of surgery and in countries without the specialty of trauma surgery it is most often a sub-specialty to orthopedic surgery. Traumatology may also be known as &quot;accident surgery&quot;.

==Branches==

Branches of traumatology include medical traumatology and psychological traumatology. Medical traumatology can be defined as the study of specializing in the treatment of wounds and injuries caused by violence or general accidents. This type of traumatology focuses on the surgical procedures and future physical therapy a patient needs to repair the damage and recover properly. Psychological traumatology is a type of damage to one&#x27;s mind due to a distressing event. This type of trauma can also be the result of overwhelming amounts of stress in one&#x27;s life. Psychological trauma usually involves some type of physical trauma that poses as a threat to one&#x27;s sense of security and survival. Psychological trauma often leaves people feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and threatened.
Trauma can also be classified as:
* Acute: It results from a single stressful or dangerous situation.
* Chronic: It results from repeated and prolonged exposure to highly stressful situations.
* Complex: It results from exposure to multiple traumatic events.
Secondary or vicarious trauma, is another form of trauma in which a person develops trauma symptoms from close contact with someone who has experienced a traumatic event.

==Types of trauma==

When it comes to types of trauma, medical and psychological traumatology go hand in hand. Types of trauma include car accidents, gunshot wounds, concussions, PTSD from incidents, etc. Medical traumas are repaired with surgeries; however, they can still cause psychological trauma and other stress factors. For example, a teenager in a car accident who broke his wrist and needed extensive surgery to save his arm may experience anxiety when driving in a car post-accident. PTSD can be diagnosed after a person experiences one or more intense and traumatic events and react with fear with complaints from three categorical symptoms lasting one month or longer. These categories are: re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoiding anything associated with the trauma, and increased symptoms of increased psychological arousal.

==Guidelines for essential trauma care==

Airway management, monitoring, and management of injuries are all key guidelines when it comes to medical trauma care. Airway management is a key component of emergency on-scene care. Using a systematic approach, first responders must assess that a patient&#x27;s airway is not blocked in order to ensure the patient gets enough circulation and remain as calm as they can. Monitoring patients and making sure their body does not go into shock is another essential guideline when it comes to medical trauma care. Nurses are required to watch over patients and check blood pressure, heart rate, etc. to make sure that patients are doing well and are not crashing. When it comes to managing injuries, head and neck injuries require the most care post surgery. Head injuries are one of the major causes of trauma related death and disabilities worldwide. It is important for patients of head trauma to get CT scans post surgery to insure that there are no problems.

==Guidelines for psychological trauma care==

There is a range of approaches to assist victims to overcome the anxiety and stress that follows psychological trauma. Affected persons can also follow self-care such as exercise and socializing with familiar and safe associates and family members. Trauma disturbs the body&#x27;s natural equilibrium by putting it in a state of fear and hyper-arousal. Exercising for thirty minutes a day facilitated the nervous system to &quot;unfreeze&quot; from a traumatic state. Being surrounded by a good support system is a powerful factor in treating psychological trauma. Participating in social activities, volunteering, and making new friends are all ways to help forget about or cope with traumatic events. Coming to terms with childhood trauma is especially challenging.
==Patient assessment==
* Advanced trauma life support, training for medical doctors dealing with trauma
* Revised Trauma Score
* Injury Severity Score
* Abbreviated Injury Scale
* Triage

==Wound assessment==
Factors in the assessment of wounds are:
* the nature of the wound, whether it is a laceration, abrasion, bruise or burn
* the size of the wound in length, width and depth
* the extent of the overall area of tissue damage caused by the impact of a mechanical force, or the reaction to chemical agents in, for example, fires or exposure to caustic substances.

Forensic physicians, as well as pathologists may also be required to examine (traumatic) wounds on people.

<text>Attard () is a town in the Central Region of Malta. Together with Balzan and Lija it forms part of &quot;the Three Villages&quot; and has been inhabited since the Classical Period. It has a population of 12,268 as of 2021. Attard&#x27;s traditional Latin motto is &quot;Florigera rosis halo&quot; (&quot;I perfume the air with my blossoms&quot;) due to its many flower gardens and citrus orchards. Attard is abundant in public gardens. The inhabitants of Attard are known as &quot;saraċini&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name of &#x27;Attard&#x27; is thought to have been derived from a surname assumed to belong to the first person who lived there. It is unclear what the word &#x27;Attard&#x27; means. Some say it means blossoms as the word &#x27;Attar&#x27; means fresh oil of the flowers or from the Arabic &#x27;Atr&#x27;, meaning perfume.

Another derivation for the surname is the Italian town of &quot;Atti&quot; in Bologna.

A few maps from the 1600s also show Attard listed as &#x27;C. Attardo&#x27;, which might show where the village name derives from.

==Municipality==

As a municipality with its own local government structure since 1994, Attard covers a surface area of about seven square kilometers. Its population, including the modern estate of Misraħ Kola and surrounding environs, is around 10,000. It comprises to its North, facing the city of Mdina, the flat expanse called Ta&#x27; Qali. Beneath it the area known as &quot;Tal-Idward&quot; joins with Misraħ Kola, across from Wied San Martin (&quot;St Martin&#x27;s Valley&quot;), Wied Inċita (&quot;Valley of Instigation&quot;) and Wied Irmiedi (&quot;Valley of Ashes&quot;), on the Żebbuġ side.

Its western front is bordered by Wied is-Sewda (&quot;Black Valley&quot;), on the Qormi side. To its east, up to Tal-Mirakli (&quot;of the Miracles&quot;) chapel on the Lija side, is a large zone called &quot;Ta&#x27; Fġieni&quot; bordering the village core and the 17th-century Parish Church of St. Mary at its centre, built by architect Tommaso Dingli. Dingli, born and bred in Attard, is best known for his work on the Wignacourt Aqueduct, Porta Reale (the entrance into Valletta) and several churches. Of these, only Attard&#x27;s parish church (with its idiosyncratic façade) and the old parish church of Birkirkara remain unaltered. South of the village core is the Sant&#x27;Anton Quarter, named for San Anton Palace and the palace&#x27;s botanic gardens, both built by the Knights between around 1600 and 1625. It is now the official residence of the president of Malta and has long been a symbol of Attard.

==Development==

During the 1980s Attard experienced a boost in development, reflected in the large-scale construction surrounding the village center. However the area surrounding the church and the Sant&#x27;Anton Quarter features a number of converted farmhouses (recognizable through their wooden doors and flat, rustic roofs) and residences built by the Knights of St John, surrounding the summer palace. Attard is also the location of the St Catherine Nursing Home, one of the largest in the Maltese Islands. The Attard Primary School serves as a polling station during elections and like all other localities in Malta, Attard Local Council elections are held every three years.

An increase in entertainment and commercial enterprise has seen development along &quot;Triq il-Pitkalija&quot; (Pitkalija Road) and near the village center, with various retail outlets catering to the village all within walking distance of St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church. The village center is a hive of activity, especially on Sundays when residents of Attard mingle with fellow churchgoers.

Attard celebrates the feast of the Assumption of Mary on 15 August, which is a national holiday on the Maltese islands.

== Clubs and societies ==
The Malta Amateur Radio League club house is situated in Attard and is the representative body for amateur radio in Malta. Since MARL was established in 1922, its aim was to bring together people interested in amateur radio/electronics and discuss and defend amateur radio matters with the local authorities. It provides educational facilities for members with interest in amateur radio/electronics and also an equipped amateur radio station. MARL corresponds and expresses its ideas with local and foreign same-interest groups, providing its members the facilities of a two-way QSL Bureau as well as financing and maintaining VHF &amp; Analog television repeaters and beacons.

The musical society of La Stella Levantina (&quot;Eastern Star&quot;) is the first of its kind in the village (formed in 1894). It organizes the major activities of the village feast held during 11–15 August, including band marches and feast decorations. It teaches music (at no cost) in its local club, situated in the center of the village.

==Notable residents==
The president&#x27;s official residence, San Anton Palace, is situated in Attard. Within walking distance of the president&#x27;s residence is the official residence of the United States Ambassador to Malta. The Tunisian embassy to Malta is located in Attard.

Gerald Strickland was also a resident of Attard, at Villa Bologna.

Attard is also home to Archbishop Paul Cremona and Tiffany Pisani, the winner of Britain&#x27;s Next Top Model season 6.

===San Anton Palace===

Visitors to the palace have included the Grand Masters of the Order of St John, Queen Marie of Romania, the Russian Empress Marie Feodorovna, King Edward VII, Queen Elizabeth II, Napoleon&#x27;s younger brother Louis Bonaparte as a prisoner, and the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

Governor Borton opened the botanic gardens to the public in 1882 for picnics and strolls. Fairs and competitions celebrating plants, flowers, animals and livestock take place there. A dramatic company used to put on a Shakespeare Festival every summer, and there are often music recitals.

During the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2005, hosted by Malta, the President&#x27;s Palace in Attard served as a residence for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.

==Sport==
Attard is the home of Attard F.C., currently competing in Maltese Challenge League (second tier).

<doc id="193409" wikidata="Q7788653" url="?curid=193409" title="Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry">
<text>Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry (157814 January 1640) was a prominent English lawyer, politician and judge during the early 17th century.

==Education and early legal career==
He entered Balliol College, Oxford, in 1592, and the Inner Temple in 1594, becoming bencher of the society in 1614, reader in 1616, and holding the office of treasurer from 1617 till 1621. His exceptional legal abilities were rewarded early with official promotion. On 16 November 1616 he was made Recorder of London in spite of Francis Bacon&#x27;s opposition, who, although allowing him to be &quot;a well trained and an honest man&quot;, objected that he was &quot;bred by my Lord Coke and seasoned in his ways&quot;. On 14 March 1617 he was appointed Solicitor General and was knighted.

==Political and judicial career==

He was returned for Droitwich to the Parliament of 1621; and on 11 January in that year was made attorney-general. He took part in the proceedings against Bacon for corruption, and was manager for the House of Commons in the impeachment of Edward Floyd for insulting the elector and electress palatine.

On 1 November 1625 he was made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal; in this capacity, he delivered Charles I&#x27;s reprimand to the Commons on 9 March 1626, when he declared that &quot;liberty of counsel&quot; alone belonged to them and not &quot;liberty of control&quot;. On 10 April 1628 he received the title of &quot;Baron Coventry of Aylesborough&quot; in Worcestershire. At the opening of parliament in 1628, he threatened that the king would use his prerogative if further thwarted in the matter of supplies. In the subsequent debates, however, while strongly supporting the king&#x27;s prerogative against the claims of the parliament to executive power, he favoured a policy of moderation and compromise. He defended the right of the council in special circumstances to commit people to prison without showing cause, and to issue general warrants. He disapproved of the king&#x27;s sudden dissolution of parliament, and agreed to the liberation on bail of the seven imprisoned members on condition of their giving security for their good behaviour.

He showed less subservience than Bacon to the Duke of Buckingham, and his resistance to the latter&#x27;s pretensions to the office of Lord High Constable greatly incensed the duke. Buckingham taunted Coventry with having gained his place by his favour; Coventry replied, &quot;Did I conceive I had my place by your favour, I would presently unmake myself by returning the seal to his Majesty&quot;. After this defiance Buckingham&#x27;s sudden death alone probably prevented Coventry&#x27;s displacement.

He passed sentence of death on Lord Audley in 1631, drafted and enforced the proclamation of 20 June 1632 ordering the country gentlemen to leave London, and in 1634 joined in William Laud&#x27;s attack on the Earl of Portland for peculation. The same year, in an address to the judges, he supported the proposed levy of ship money on the inland as well as the maritime counties on the plea of the necessity of effectually arming, &quot;so that they might not be enforced to fight&quot;, &quot;the wooden walls&quot; being in his opinion &quot;the best walls of this kingdom&quot;. He voted in Star Chamber in 1633 to remove the Irish judge Lord Sarsfield from office for corruption, censuring him severely for hearing a murder case in private and for bullying the jury into returning a guilty verdict.

In the Star Chamber Coventry was one of John Lilburne&#x27;s judges in 1637, but he generally showed conspicuous moderation, inclining to leniency in the cases of Richard Chambers in 1629 for seditious speeches, and of Henry Sherfield in 1632 for breaking painted glass in a church. He prevented also the hanging of men for resistance to impressment, and pointed out its illegality, since the men were not subject to martial law. While contributing thirty horse to the Scottish expedition in 1638, and lending the king £10,000 in 1639, he gave no support to the forced loan levied upon the city in the latter year.

==Summary==

Lord Coventry held the great seal for nearly fifteen years (1625–40), and was enabled to collect a large fortune. He was an able judge, and he issued some important orders in chancery, probably alluded to by Wood, who ascribes to him a tract on &quot;The Fees of all law Officers&quot;. Bulstrode Whitelocke accuses him of mediocrity, but his contemporaries in general have united in extolling his judicial ability, his quick despatch of business and his sound and sterling character. Clarendon in particular praises his statesmanship, and compares his capacity with Lord Strafford&#x27;s, adding, however, that he seldom spoke in the council except on legal business and had little influence in political affairs; to the latter circumstance, he owed his exceptional popularity. He describes him as having &quot;in the plain way of speaking and delivery a strange power of making himself believed&quot;, as a man of &quot;not only firm gravity but a severity and even some morosity&quot;, as &quot;rather exceedingly liked than passionately loved&quot;.

==Family==

Lord Coventry was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Coventry, judge of the common pleas (a descendant of John Coventry, Lord Mayor of the City of London in the reign of Henry VI), and of Margaret Jeffreys of Earls Croome, or Croome D&#x27;Abitot, in Worcestershire.

He married:

1. Sarah, (sister of Sir Edward Sebright of Besford in Worcestershire, and daughter of John Sebright by Anne Bullingham), by whom besides a daughter he had one son,
:*Thomas, who succeeded him as 2nd baron, and
2. Elizabeth, daughter of John Aldersley of Spurstow, Cheshire, and widow of William Pitchford, by whom he had four more sons and four more daughters:
:*John, father of Sir John Coventry
:*Francis,
:*Henry, Secretary of State (1672–1680) and
:*Sir William Coventry, the statesman;
:*Anne married Sir William Savile, 3rd baronet (1629) and then Thomas Chicheley of Wimpole (1645)
:*Mary married Sir Henry Frederick Thynne, 1st Baronet
:*Margaret married Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, later Earl of Shaftesbury
:*Dorothy married Sir John Pakington, 2nd Baronet.

Thomas Coventry, 5th baron (died 1699), was created Earl of Coventry in 1697 with a special limitation, on the failure of his own male issue, to that of Walter, youngest brother of the lord keeper, from whom the present earl of Coventry is descended.

<text>Ralphy Rodriguez (born April 17, 1973, in Carolina, Puerto Rico) is a singer/songwriter, musician, producer, and former member of Menudo. He replaced Charlie Massó.

Ralphy joined Menudo in late 1986 as Charlie Masso&#x27;s replacement. He was a member of a Menudo line-up that included Ricky Martin, Raymond Acevedo, Sergio Blass, Ruben Gomez and Robi Rosa. His first project with Menudo was acting in the 100 episode soap opera “Por siempre amigos” which had the boyband living in Buenos Aires, Argentina for 6 months during the filming of the project. It aired in 1987 on WAPA TV in Puerto Rico, in Argentina, and few other markets. 

Ralphy’s first performance with Menudo was at the Araneta Coliseum in Manila Philippines in late 1986, where he was first introduced as newest member of the group. His first performance in Puerto Rico was on Jan 6th, 1987 at the Hiram Bithorn Coliseum for the boyband’s yearly “Three Kings Day” concert. 

He sang the songs &quot;Cuando Seas Grande&quot; and &quot;Y Te Veré (A Las Tres)&quot; featured on the Spanish album Somos Los Hijos del Rock as well as “Come back to me” and “Sa Bawat Halik” from the English album “In Action” released in the Philippines. In December of 1987, Ralphy was pulled out of the group by his parents, citing improper treatment by management.

In 1991, Edgardo Diaz (the band’s founder) was accused by ex members of Menudo of physical and sexual abuse towards Menudo members in various interviews. In a May 1991 Univision Television Program Cristina Show, with Rodriguez and his dad present as main accusers, Diaz denied the allegations. Diaz has been the target of several sexual crime allegations by former Menudo members. Roy Rossello accused him of sexual abuse during a Brazilian reality show&#x27;s transmission on October 21, 2014. 

Rodríguez became a born-again Christian in 1995, and released 3 Christian Inspirational CD’s between 1998-2008. In 1998 he released the Independent Album “Ralphy - El pie del mundo”, then released two albums with the Christian Label Canzion, “Ralphy - Quiero” in 2001 and “Ralphy Rodriguez - Voy a Tí” in 2008, which features a duet with Marcos Witt “Volví a vivir”, written by Juan Pablo Manzanero. He’s a Latin Grammy recipient as one of the vocalists on Marcos Witt’s 2004 award winning album “Recordando Otra Vez”, where he sang lead vocal on the classic “Peña de Horeb” as well as background vocals on the album. 

After various years away from music to focus on raising a family with his wife, he made his return to music in 2017. He is co-founder, lead vocalist and bass player for the international pop-rock band “2080 VEINTE/OCHENTA”. The band released their first single “Lo haré por ti” on August 31, 2020. 

Ralphy Rodriguez took part of the HBO Max Documentary &quot;Menudo: Forever Young&quot; alongside 12 other former Menudo members who shared their real life experiences within the iconic boyband. This 4 part mini-series was released on June 23, 2022.

During one of former &quot;Los Chamos&quot; member Gabriel Fernandez&#x27;s YouTube &quot;Retro Show&quot; podcasts in 2023, it was revealed that Rodriguez and his former Menudo bandmates Sergio Gonzalez (Sergio Blass), Raymond Acevedo and Ruben Gomez would go on tour as a super-group they named &quot;Evoluxion&quot;, which would emulate another super-group of former Menudo members, &quot;El Reencuentro&quot;. &quot;Evoluxion&quot; was Rodriguez&#x27;s idea. The X in EvoluXion is because in Spanish, &quot;ex&quot; is commonly used as a word that means &quot;former&quot;, and the band is, like Proyecto M, composed of former Menudo members. EvoluXion released their first single “Sin querer” in August of 2024 and did their first live concert in Mexico City on Nov. 24 of the same year.
